Apr 10 2024,negative, 5010      like a little idiot i laughed every time chris hemsworth did something this movie is not like awful doesnt really do anything new and the visuals arent really like that great just feels a little dry the comedy ether pretty giggle worthy or really miss although the actors all have some pleasant chemistry grade c
Apr 2 2024,negative,even such an excellent cast cant counterbalance such a cringy script
Apr 1 2024,negative,this movie just gave me a headache kristen wiigs character is annoying the special effects were better in the 1984 version chris hemsworth is just dumb i ceased to care about the storyline  if there actually was one  not sure i even smiled let alone laugh
Apr 1 2024,positive,the movie was funny as a parody of ghostbusters but cannot really be taken seriously as part of the ghostbusters franchise as the entire cast is made up from saturday night live comedians    the movie does get some cameos which is great but their roles do not align correctly with the ghostbusters franchise either  if you like saturday night live their cast or into comedy then you will probably like this movie however if youre a die hard ghostbusters fan you will probably hate the movie    the movie is similar to many of the movies out their that kind of pokes fun at the original movie  my family and i did enjoy the movie we thought it was funny  my wife didnt recognize the saturday night live casting but still thought it was funny  overall not a bad movie just fun and silly
Apr 1 2024,positive,having just watched frozen empire at the cinema i thought id give this another viewing only got through about 15 minutes the first time you know what this is pretty good its funny its got great effects they actually bust ghosts and fun characters theres shades nice pun right of borrowing from the first two but they dance a fine line between contrived and paying homage i think this movie doesnt get the love it deserves it does need to sit outside the main timeline though
Mar 29 2024,negative,a stupidly poor standalone remake of a classic movie franchise skip and move straight to ghostbusters afterlife
Mar 29 2024,negative,the story is not that good the cgi is obviously better than the first two films yet different eras
Mar 27 2024,negative,after years of no ghostbusters 3 the older the guys got the less i felt i wanted one  the moment the reboot was announced with paul feige i was willing to give it a go as he was the genius behind the heat bridesmaids and spy all which i loved and mc carthy back after spy i felt this was gonna be really good the trailer came out suggested that it was set after the original films and the opening sequence was actually kinda creepy and started strong  much like the 84 original we are introduced to the team and thou there were a few laughs here and there we got to the first ghost at the rock concert my problem with this part of the film i was hoping for world building you know the fact they are carrying unlicensed nuclear accelerators on their backs a moment to fuck up and correct themselves you know real stuff that real people go through but nope these gals move through with perfection huge ghost at a rock concert surly they will evacuated the people so they can catch it  nope not here nothing in this scene made a lick of sense and played up the lets go with it its a comedy for laughs thing problem is your world building ha e fun sure but dont belittled the audience or your own movie  the film went on and every single make character was either dumb incompetent or just a dick   i know its female ghostbusters but majority of your audience are guys   i digress then comes the cameos pointless cameos that didnt add to the film just distract as they were not playing their old characters and cementing that it was just a reboot period  the finally sucked in a huge cgi gun battle across nyc and the whole film like most dumpster sony studio pics smelt of rotten eggs  probably one of the worst films ive ever witnessed i feel sorry for the poor actresses in this thing as they were all top talent
Mar 26 2024,positive,this movie is not perfect but gets half of the writing and the fight scenes right not the most ideal reboot but its good enough to have that charm that the ghostbusters franchise holds
Mar 25 2024,negative,remakes are tricky to say the very least some work some dont    i loved the female cast who are all fantastic but for me this film didnt work i just couldnt get into it and i am only being 100 honest when i say i didnt like it    its a shame because it had a lot going for it but it just didnt do for me
Mar 24 2024,positive,hilarious tons of good jokes appropriately campy very reminiscent of the old gbs use of chris hemsworth is particularly good
Mar 24 2024,positive,girl power and proton packs a review of ghostbusters 2016    director paul feig injects fresh energy into the beloved franchise with his 2016 reboot of ghostbusters  this allfemale team brings a hilarious and heartfelt twist to the classic story of paranormal pest control    kristen wiig and melissa mccarthy are a comedic dream team as erin gilbert and abby yates brilliant scientists who uncover undeniable proof of ghosts  kate mckinnon steals scenes as the eccentric engineer jillian holtzmann while leslie jones brings a dry wit and sharp attitude to patty tolan a skeptical mta worker who becomes a believer  their camaraderie feels genuine making their journey to becoming fearless ghostbusters all the more satisfying    while some might have been skeptical of a genderswapped cast the film never feels gimmicky the focus is on the characters intelligence humor and unique skills  chris hemsworth is a delightful surprise as the clueless but charming kevin a hunky receptionist who joins the team      the film boasts impressive special effects creating a visually stunning array of ghosts and ghouls  the action sequences are thrilling with proton pack battles and spectral showdowns that are a blast to watch     ghostbusters 2016 is a worthy successor to the original it honors the legacy of the franchise while offering a fresh perspective  full of laughs scares and girl power its a funfilled adventure for audiences of all ages
Mar 24 2024,negative,this film is the epitome of a bad reboot rather than continuing the story it just takes the old film and retells it in a worse manner it takes a very funny cast and marries them to a godawful script which try as it might cannot get many laughs the only reason it doesnt get one star is that there are one or two gags that somehow make it through the awful script to get a laugh but the rest of the film is just dire
Mar 23 2024,positive,i didnt hate it but i definitely didnt love it it was enjoyable but some of the jokes just didnt quite land 
Mar 23 2024,negative,i absolutely love the cast in this movie they are all fantastic phenomenal and very funny but this was very mediocre and honestly i think a big part of it is the script i know that the director refused the movie multiple times and then when he did get it he decided he wanted to alter it more to his style    the original script was more than solid and i think would have worked pretty well but as hollywood always done they like to change everything about a script until you cant even recognize what it originally was    i really hope they do a team up of some other kind in the future with this cast but this movie was not a fun experience at all
Mar 22 2024,negative,with four great ghostbuster movies involving the original cast stay clear of this reboot its a waste of time and an insult to the original masterpiece
Mar 21 2024,positive,this was a great take on the ghostbusters i know it gets a lot of hate but i thought the movie was pretty good the original movie is still the best in the series i appreciated the fresh idea but it just didnt work i would have liked to see a sequel to see if they could have stood on their own but that didnt happen with that said i give this film 5 stars because it is a good movie just keep your expectations of the original in check and appreciate what the film tries to do which opens up the franchise to a broader audience ghostbusters can be for girls too
Mar 21 2024,negative,a cheap attempt to recapture the comedy and scifi magic of the original tries to be funny but fails miserably definitely a horrible remake
Mar 20 2024,negative,not funny uncool bad cgi chris hemsworth worth the watch bad score i can go on forever baby
Mar 20 2024,negative,im okay with reboots  even gender swaps  but the lack of good writing made all the acting and comedic moments feel forced and therefore more embarassing then funny
Mar 20 2024,positive,i lived it i thought it was very funny the female cast was great they were as goofy or more so than the original crew i have watched it a few times
Mar 9 2024,positive,in all honesty this is an average movie  neither the best nor the worst  some of the comedy worked some didnt  most of the practical effects were as cool as i remembered them even back in the previous two movies along with the new gadgets that were pretty badass that even elevates the ghostbusting scenes  everyone did perform well as they were having fun especially melissa mccarthy and kristen wiig  except for chris hemsworth sadly  i think this movie gets too much hate since it was released and still does from both sides  but let me be onehundred percent honest its such a headache to take sides  if you love this film thats fine  if you hate this film thats your opinion  all in all i still had fun even by some of the comedy that doesnt work well especially with how the story leads into  and the cameos however dont feel that good as its an example of a cameo done wrong  actually if anything sums it up this movie is like how one of the futurama episodes involving boxes and alternate dimensions being an alternative dimension  610
Mar 4 2024,negative,i went in with an open mind but i did not find the jokes all that funny the actors and actresses were great but the writers of this film were just bad maybe in the new ghostbusters they can write this movies cast with the newer ones cast to tie all storylines together
Mar 4 2024,positive,i honestly love this version im not sure why it gets such low reviews i thought the cast of funny ladies is pretty solid their humor works together really well and the effects are well done i like the storyline and the nods at the originals im a fan of the old versions as well as the reboots i feel like theres plenty of room for this take on the brand
Mar 4 2024,negative,like a lot of the work by the talent in other films this is a hard miss
Mar 3 2024,negative,its okay i really wanted to like this reboot but its just flat i hate to say it but the only actor who shines in this femaledriven cast is the man chris hemsworth plays the typical dimwitted but good looking muscle almost as dumb as season 10 joey from friends that joey cant speak french episode makes me cringe every time which at first i found annoying but really setup his transition to the spoiler alert bad guy in the final act which doesnt get the opportunity to work because the film dissolves into a washed out cgi extravaganza    the main four start out likeable but fall into their archetypes pretty fast  melissa mccarthy who for the record is a fantastic actress with potential playing the as the late chris farley once put it fatty fall down role as she often did in the 2010s if thats not too harsh to say in 2024  kate mckinnon plays the rebel  kristen wiig plays kristen wiig  leslie jones plays the blue collar worker    each one by themself is an alright character who i could buy would be part of the ghostbusters team but together none of them have any real chemistry as it feels like there was no script and theyre all just comedians riffing with each other    despite some good visual design work including ghosts who do look like they would belong in the original film i would not recommend this movie in my opinion reboots should either be a modern but faithful retelling of the original or should be radically different and try to stand out from what came before it this film has a hand in each cookie jar and suffers for it
Feb 24 2024,negative,using a female cast to change from the past allmale cast is an idea weve already seen and isnt always something bad making them look good is logical you always want your main characters to look good after all  but this this is just too much every single male is a moron who doesnt understand anything and cant add two and two to make four and i mean every single one all female characters are pictured as strong and independent characters that are extremely clever and i have no problem with that however they are always mocking men and men dont react because they are even too stupid to understand whats going on  i guess the idea here was to make a change from the original movies where the main cast was allmale and the woman needed to be saved of course the way women are depicted in these movies may seem oldfashioned and even offensive to some people but it is absolutely not a reason to reply several decades later with an even worse movie  it seems like an immature movie to me  of course the special effects are way better than the two past movies that i cant deny but however good a movie looks the idea behind still wastes everything  therefore i think this movie is quite enjoyable if you only watch the movie for its special effects and to pass time if you are looking for a good storyline or good characters just look somewhere else  you will lose your time here
Feb 19 2024,positive,amazing cast one of the best science fictioncomedy movies the choice of cast was incredible they complemented the vibe of the plot and gave a much needed refreshing  approach 1010
Feb 17 2024,negative,its hard for me to be honest about this movie because im so fond of most of the cast  instead of being engaged in the story and the laughs i just found myself annoyed by the cheese  maybe im just too loyal to the original movies
Feb 5 2024,negative,poor remake which is nothing near the classic
Jan 24 2024,positive,seriously its funny  what this film fails at is merely not being the original and that is a crime that it can be forgiven for  the cast are brilliant  mckinnon in particular is dazzling it is fun packed action packed and deliciously witty it takes jabs at itself  it certainly does not take itself seriously as well as at the original film all the while poking at gender stereotypes its a blast from start to finish and just as funny on rewatching 
Nov 12 2023,negative,it tired so bad to  be funny it fell on its face add poorly  written and then you have this horrible parody of a film 
Nov 10 2023,positive,after all the sexist hype i avoided watching this for ages big mistake it was funny with great characters and good plot way better than afterlife which was a plodding mess watch it and make up your own mind
Nov 9 2023,positive,ghostbusters 2016 was an ok movie but it did have some funny moments and good ghostbusting moments too also it had ok cameos but it was nice to see the original ghostbusters back in this film over all this movie was not as good as the original two movies were
Nov 1 2023,negative,i would have enjoyed it if i had some drinks maybe otherwise the original is 1000 better
Oct 23 2023,negative,this remake is just a big disaster chris hemsworth character is awful its a surprise that he signed the contract for this movie
Oct 20 2023,positive,ive watched the originals as a kid and loved watching this as an adult funny cute engaging and i loved all the references to the original also love getting to see some of my favorite female comedians take on a classic i re watch it every october
Oct 19 2023,positive,this movie was just hilarious such a great cast and even some og ghostbusters make an appearance do yourself a favor and give it a shot it is very entertaining
Oct 16 2023,positive,it is hard to remake a classic like ghostbusters especially  when the original is so iconic yet we have a all womans cast here that at times is funny but makes you just wanna rewatch the classic 1984 version  i liked kristen wigg for the most part here the however movie seems like it was trying a little hard to be something it was not lesley jones also had some funny moments made me generally laugh like the original you have a cast mostly that was on snl so you expect comedy from talented people i say it is worth a look but i would recommend that you go see the original film but this version is not as bad as i thought it would be
Oct 2 2023,positive,this dvd is really cool its like reliving the 80s but with better effects great sound and near perfect image quality this time around i could actually understand the story and see what was happening the female ghost busters are great too because theyre funny and more likable as characters the new remixed soundtrack is just awesome in 51 surround and the main theme plays in full on the dvd main menu which i really liked
Sep 28 2023,positive,really enjoyed this silly remake of the classic  fun goofy movie to watch when you just want to forget about the world
Sep 22 2023,positive,i liked how they did the special effects digital and costumes
Sep 21 2023,negative,a very poor attempt at a remake the plot is literally scene for scene unfunny and they did nothing but attack the ghost busters fans this is a pathetic fake fan fiction and nothing more
Sep 21 2023,negative,bad humour and horrible acting make this the kind of movie that you wish you could purge from your memory
Aug 28 2023,negative,didnt even make it to the end its unfunny and just a bad movie
Aug 21 2023,positive,i dont understand all the hate and woke criticism they made it with all females because bill murray kept making it impossible for them to do a real one so it was obviously one of those things that well people want one and if we have to do it different then lets have fun with it and go all out plus with the success of bridesmaids of course it sounded like a perfect idea its fun it ads new tech holtzman is awesome and its just a different universe i actually like this better than the family drama that is afterlife
Aug 20 2023,negative,its not even worth the effort go back and watch the original as it would be far more worth the time spent no matter how many times youve seen it
Aug 16 2023,negative,terrible movie disgrace to the original movies
Aug 14 2023,neutral,honestly its worth a watch its a halloween movie that provides a few laughs and passes the time
Aug 12 2023,negative,3rd worst film i have ever seen terrible acting abysmal writing
Aug 10 2023,positive,not as good as the original
Aug 6 2023,positive,as a movie it was pretty decent for a reboot it was dogshit 5910
Aug 4 2023,negative,god this was terrible hardly anything worse than a comedy that never makes you laugh i smirked twice horrific cg boring plot everything terrible everyone involved should be ashamed
Aug 2 2023,negative,this was an insult to the original cast writers and directors absolutely awful from beginning to end the cast have all done fine work in other films but this teamup with a poor story horrifically predictable script and weak comedy was just painful to endure hope to god there is no sequel to this wreck
Jul 30 2023,negative,loved ghostbusters 1 and 2 and was watching this in order so 2016 is the natural next step i usually love melissa mccarthy and chris hemsworth movies if they had even a modicum of a decent concept it could have work the basis was man feels slighted by society and decides to get revenge using ghosts the end   there were really awful characters in it that were over the top bill murrays was evil  hemsworths was an idiot chick magnet most of the movie and finally one of the main characters blond scientist portraying a genius was so incompetent should have been placed in a psychiatric ward not around anything that could cause harm to people and animals   my rating says it all this was rotten if you want to waste 2 hours of your life then watch it
Jul 25 2023,positive,this film was quite entertaining some jokes made me laugh and some made me cringe in some ways better than the original 2 and worse in others a remake no one asked for but im glad this was made
Jul 25 2023,positive,beautiful funny brilliant cast so much fan service   absolutely devastated that theres no follow up
Jul 21 2023,negative,a bunch of raceswapped woke trash so unoriginal not because there are women you dont touch an original masterpiece like the 80s ghostbusters creativity is hard to find nowadays in films sad
Jul 19 2023,negative,ghostbusters 2016 had one joke it was men are incompetent and women are competent ghostbusters afterlife however was great
Jul 15 2023,negative,this movie is the worst reboot ever
Jul 14 2023,negative,this is hot garbage its simple not funny it feels like the entire movie was just improved that kate mckinnon is especially bad i dont know if shes actually mentally challenged or just playing someone who is either way not funny and its inappropriate   either rewatch the other original onesor smash your toes so bad you have go to the er each is a better choice youve been warned
Jun 30 2023,negative,easily one of the worst movies ive ever seen i mean going in i didnt expect it to have a compelling plot or worldclass acting or anything  but a movie starring all comedians is supposed to be funny i dont think i laughed once and the first maybe 40 mins of the movie is the second most bored ive ever been while watching a movie    just completely atrocious  i cannot believe that it got even mediocre scores here
Jun 19 2023,negative,really wanted to like it but it was not good
Jun 19 2023,negative,mindless re do of a classic movie only thing  they id was a gender swap and managed to suck out all humour and joy
Jun 6 2023,positive,there are some funny gags and kate mckinnon is especially hilarious but a lot of the movie felt like it was improv while lacking some much needed character arcs
May 31 2023,negative,theres a reason that this movie never got a sequel even without comparing it to its predecessors or successors the film is a bland and unfulfilling film that fails to justify its own existence it would have failed miserably without the brand just skip straight to ghostbusters afterlife
May 16 2023,negative,an entirely unnecessary remake a desperate attempt by hollywood to try and cash in on an existing franchise no wonder it bombed
May 1 2023,positive,this film has gotten a lot of hate particularly from people placing it in contrast to the other ghost busters films but taking them out of it i thoroughly enjoyed this
Apr 24 2023,positive,i like ghost cracker they were so cheezy i turned into cookie from goofy movie  mickey mouse 3am amogus
Apr 23 2023,positive,as a kid of the 80s the ghostbusters franchise had a lasting impression on me with the animated series and the movies so i was indeed happy to be seeing the franchise back on the screen again with this remake ive come to learn that similar to the original movie this remake has an snlfilled cast as well some of the comedic gags are far too silly especially with chris hemsworth but there are enough laughs to keep the movie going of course it can be criticised that the plot is far too similar to the original and hardly brings anything new but i still feel like giving it a free pass just for being able to see more ghostbusting action once again
Apr 18 2023,negative,the movie we didnt want nor deserve this tragic resurrection of an iconic franchise is best forgotten
Apr 14 2023,positive,i thought this movie was really funny i grew up with ghostbusters but never really thought of it as a top comedy movie of the 80s i laughed much more watching this crew of snl legends and mm chris hemsworth is a gem in his role
Apr 8 2023,negative,no humour bad performances and a deritive story make this a must miss
Mar 16 2023,negative,most pointless reboot ever unfunny with bad acting and just a terrible movie in general should have never been made probably laughed once or twice at how dumb the jokes were
Mar 13 2023,negative,wasted opportunity it could have been a passing of the torch movie with the original cast in their original roles this film is boring theres not comedy at all the characters are bland and annoying or blatantly stupid they talk in random fakesciencey lingo to pretend to be smart but the dialogue actually bore the viewer the cast from the original movie apear in cameos that are pathetic and this movie pretends its the first of his kind inuniverse stay away from this
Mar 4 2023,positive,i dont understand the bad reviews for this it was a funny movie great actresses i loved the cameos from the old cast yes the editing could have been better but an enjoyable watch
Feb 4 2023,negative,was not a good movie at all the jokes were not funny the acting was very tryhard and the plot was just not good i prefer the original much more
Feb 1 2023,positive,its years after it was released but i finally saw it and found it fun the comediennes are the best out there i was surprised it brought such ire from fans
Jan 28 2023,positive,great film hilarious cast amazing effects and great world building best movie in the series
Jan 28 2023,negative,c also 4 out of 10 a lazy excuse of a reboot that has afew good scenes here and there and good visuals but when it comes to its story and characters thats were it goes wrong the characters are mediocre same for the story but at least its not the worst movie ever because i have seen worst films like the slips like the emoji movie or teenage mutant ninja turtles 3 or ice age 6 so this movie those pass the time thankfully
Jan 25 2023,negative,what were they thinking when they made this    this film is like a cringe compilation everything the characters do in this is all cringe the director may think its funny but none of it is funny its cringe perhaps the directors humor is cringe they probably dont have many friends if so
Jan 23 2023,negative,horrible only saw it once and never again
Jan 15 2023,negative,not for me i guess i grew up with the originals this is just bad
Jan 13 2023,negative,stale and fails to make of use a very talented cast due to poor and lazy writing and storytelling
Jan 9 2023,positive,the story was ok but i just thought some of the cast was trying to hard 
Jan 3 2023,negative,i was expecting this to be one of those 0 movies from critics and near 0 from audiences im worried for humanity that anyone found this to be a good movie its not even the good kind of bad where you can watch it with friends and make fun of it its just bad bad
Dec 29 2022,positive,gave this hated movie a rewatch while i did enjoy the first half of the movie the humor the busters themselves are a great ensemble and the updated production values this just isnt a ghostbusters movie i know they needed the name to make this movie relevant but why not just go for a parody instead of a full reboot the allfemale cast i dont mind but why the underlying manhate every white man is evil or just dumb a big swing and a huge miss
Dec 25 2022,negative,painful to watch copying the structure from the original it filled all scenes with ill constructed dialogue and constant yammering of unlikeable characters i was embarrassed for the he movie
Dec 24 2022,negative,bad actors bad concept bad writing bad jokes if you can call them that
Dec 16 2022,positive,i thought it was funny and quirky and scary and a great use of incredibly talented actors id have wished it built on the old universe but understood why it didnt
Dec 3 2022,negative,absolutely the worst comedy writing delivery and acting ive ever seen complete garbage
Nov 30 2022,negative,one of the least funny and most disrespectful films of all time
Nov 29 2022,negative,i dont think they should have made the ghostbusters series with female actors and then have an original actor from the original series come in and be like the debbie downer saying theyre no such thing as ghosts and then a couple years later come out with a movie to continue with this story the original story and the other reason is i just was more fond of the original actors as many of everyone else who is probably going to read my review will probably agree dont get me wrong im not saying dont do female actors oceans 8 was phenomenally done with female actors as the actual cast but they just need to do a better job with a storyline cuz there were parts that i could not understand or get behind
Nov 16 2022,negative,flee you fools one of the worst writtenacted movie ever made with so much money i really dont know who is supposed to be the audience while sfx and such are correct thus aiming at adults the story and the comedy is tailored for  38y old  even toddlers wouldnt be proud of the jokes in the movie it ruins the movie tearing down the ghost atmosphere at each conversation characters are a complete mess poorly written    the same conversations in a animated series aimed at 38y would be acceptable for tv standards i guess 
Nov 7 2022,positive,some jokes were funny it was ok not as bad as most people make it out to be
Nov 1 2022,positive,sry funny and comedic however not as good as the originals i liked the strong women roles and it did help me bond with this movie cgi was pretty bad and other members of my family noticed that too
Nov 1 2022,negative,a wonderful and impressive lesson in how to screw up a great formula it had potential but the absolutely atrocious over acting where the actresses just tried too hard then there is the male character a useless waste of ink on paper talk about trying to destroy any masculinity from pretty much the universe and here it is  absolute waste of time
Nov 1 2022,positive,the best of the ghostbuster movies funny smart charming and the effects were solidly okay its still ghostbusters they have to be a bit cheesy
Nov 1 2022,neutral, theres some laughs supplied by mostly chris hemsworth otherwise a reboot had no reason to exist it could have been a sequel but chose not be and everyone involved knocked the fan base as well
Oct 27 2022,negative,it is the worst movie ever and its a cheap knockoff of the real ghostbusters movies and plus i hate this movie worst movie ever
Oct 24 2022,negative,first of all why does this movie remind me of something out of nickelodeon the way the cgi is the colour palette is and even the type of jokes there is it seems like they focus way too much in its characters and its over the top jokes and acting when i mean acting im talking about how they act in the movie its like they overreacting which you usually see in mostly nickelodeon and disney series  the movie should have focuses way more on the story because it might been as funny as is was when it came out of as time goes by you have already seen and heard all the jokes so sit through the movie watching jokes that just isnt funny any more and the story isnt that exciting enough in a whole the movie doesnt as actually age well if you have seen the extended version and the theatrical version which actually has more scenes that just makes you cringe like the part with the ghost on on that ladys neck which the cgi looked so bad and even the dance sequence    this movie would have been great if they havent tried to replace the original and rather made it a spinoff set in the same universe
Oct 22 2022,negative,this movie is basically the exact same as the original ghostbusters except its more boring less funny and it has slightly better effects
Oct 19 2022,positive,this movie is funny quirky fun and highly entertaining i catch myself watching this one more than the two originals while the originals are nostalgic this movie takes the ghostbusters franchise up a notch the only reason people are negative about it is because it has 4 females in the lead roles instead of the original 4 males the misogyny runs deep in the reviews of this movie which is sad because its actually a much better movie than some people give it credit for
Oct 19 2022,positive,i really believed the negative press that this was a terrible movie its cracking me up  i dont know what their problem is all those salty reviewers these ladies are funny
Oct 14 2022,negative,on par w ghostbusters 2  afterlife meaning dont watch it just watch the original and pretend these dont exist
Oct 14 2022,positive,this movie is breathtaking honestly beter than the original such a fresh and perfect story telling and writing the cinematogrophy and cgi was so beautiful and can easily become a family favourite film the feminism felt so refreshing and powerful and i loved every minute 55
Oct 10 2022,negative,i think no im sure i wasted 30 minutes of my life wanting to watch the ghostbuster movie we stopped the movie so much that it was nonsense  bad and really condescending humor
Oct 8 2022,positive,its no surprise that this reboot had big shoes to fill overall being scared of ghosts and adding perfectly welltime humour is something the previous films did well some viewers do not like the idea of the male characters in this film being either mean or incredibly dumb this didnt get me down during the movie the films plot and the main villain are also forgettable the film also tries to introduce new creative weapons to the point that our heroes are disappointing
Oct 1 2022,positive,this movie was really good i dont know why everyone cried about it it did what it set out to do just like its predecessors
Oct 1 2022,negative,i dont know how you could have made this movie any worse this has to be one of the worst movies released that year and failed miserably at the box office i think to just pretend this movie never existed
Sep 28 2022,positive,i had very low expectations for this movie but i was shocked when i actually enjoyed it in my opinion it was even funnier than the original and had some some old elements brought back and some new elements introduced
Sep 27 2022,positive,for a movie no one asked for its not bad  the comedy is often hilarious though kate mckinnons overacting sometimes gets in the way  wouldve scored higher if the ending had more punch
Sep 26 2022,negative,i mean no one really thought this was going to be good
Sep 17 2022,negative,the film brings many details of ghostbusters 1984 but not the same emotion and comedy a typical remake of beloved old movies to bring nostalgia to fans it slightly satisfies the desire to see the ghostbusters plot again on tv but with big flaws
Sep 15 2022,negative,the death of a beloved childhood classic
Sep 13 2022,negative,wow someone actually thought this would be a good movie to sign off on the cgi is poor and the acting is comically subpar
Sep 13 2022,negative,ironically this comedy isnt funny
Sep 13 2022,negative,really horrible reboot a shameful attempt at ghostbusters just bring back the old actors
Sep 11 2022,negative,this was a really bad watch this movie was not funny and the dialog dragged on for way to long
Sep 10 2022,negative,why did they turn ghost buster into a rom com this is also an insult to women and the ghostbusters fans
Sep 8 2022,negative,the writing is lazy on a good day the main characters are like recycled paper  very close to the original but not as good thats not to discredit the talent of the actresses playing them what they had to work with was similar to the line from multiplicity you know when you make a copy of a copy and its not as sharp as the original  yeah thats ghostbusters 2016 in a nutshell melissa mccarthy is clearly supposed to be ray stantz kristin wiig is a shadow of peter venkman kate mckinnon is egon spengler with a tbi and leslie jones is winston zeddemore lacking any charm or subtlety   i do have to give it to the cgi department though the effects are outstanding and probably saved the movie from being an even bigger disaster
Sep 6 2022,neutral,not great but not that bad paul feig and the cast did way better in other movies but its a passable movie of a a passable franchise even the original despite being a classic its just an ok movie people took way way too seriously for ludicrous reasons a movie that was supposed to just being fun lighthearted and forgettable
Sep 3 2022,negative,cant believe they tried to remake ghostbusters worst idea ever the original is a cult classic if this movie was was made to be a continuation of the story then it would have been recieved better still a bad movie but it would have got less hate dont bother watching this one
Sep 2 2022,positive,really dont understand why people dont like this movie is it just because theyre women lol imagine being that mad over their gender its a good movie nonetheless
Sep 1 2022,positive,i did not anything wrong with this movie  it was so fun  and it was smart
Aug 29 2022,negative,wish this film was a ghost so i didnt have to see it
Aug 28 2022,negative,terrible attempt of a remake and corny in the worst ways nothing against the talent they are all great performers the movie just had bad writing and the story was not good the energy these actors bring does not fit this story
Aug 22 2022,negative,terrible terrible terrible how was this allowed to be made  and the audacity to name it the same as the original wow it was basically a bad snl skit
Aug 22 2022,negative,this is a very poorly made film the comedy was very lowbrow and is a direct insult to the original movies
Aug 20 2022,positive,this is hands down still the most fun ghostbusters to watch
Aug 18 2022,negative,i didnt enjoy this movie at all  i suffered through it only because im a big fan of the franchise and i was hoping it would get somehow get better as it played out however the movie sucked from start to finish which was extremely disappointing as i love all these actresses and enjoy their other work when i first heard of this movie and saw the casting i was beyond excited to see it  it didnt deliver on any front the laughs and gags were forced and there was just no meaningful chemistry or bonding between the characters the exaggerated character quirks just didnt jive with a believable or enjoyable movie at all honestly it felt like i was watching a bunch of snl skits they clipped together to make a full length feature as there was no build up or upward trajectory of the plot if i could give it 0 stars i would
Aug 12 2022,negative,one of the worst reboots of all time leslie jones plays the same insufferable character she plays in every movie the humor is awful stay away at all costs
Aug 9 2022,negative,a terrible attempt at gender swooping and retelling the same story trying their best to destroy decades of an established cannon and nostalgia    please create new stories or continue the original story
Aug 1 2022,negative,that film completely destroys ghost busters where did they find the thespians mental health clinic
Jul 31 2022,negative,very cringy no wonder people hated this
Jul 23 2022,negative,horrible stop injecting modern radical thinking and talking points into movies and keep it to the universe it is in
Jul 21 2022,neutral,i remember this being worse than the original and having bad cgi but i dont remember it being a 49
Jul 18 2022,negative,they should have never made this it was an insult to the first one not an hommage
Jul 7 2022,negative,this movie was just so awful on so many levels i literally had to force myself to watch the whole thing bc i didnt want to waste my money nothing beats the original ghostbusters with bill murray though that was a great film this one gets an f
Jul 3 2022,negative,i truly hate this movie the og one from 1984 and 1989 is much better then this piece of shit movie
Jul 2 2022,neutral,dull and unforgettable  not sure why its so flat but glad the afterlife course corrected this
Jun 29 2022,positive,i dont understand why this movie got a lot of hate i really enjoyed it and was awesome with a great group of female leads that brought the comedy whenever they needed it granted that it was over the top at points the convoluted story and throwbacks to ghostbusters were cool and messy at the same time but the humorous and actionpacked quips along with great sequences and fantastic executions definitely made me enjoy this movie more than other people did
Jun 23 2022,negative,this is a masterclass in how to make the most dull sequel that feels like a cashgrab by using the originals name each cameo is pointless and is used pretty much exclusively just so they can say wow its bill murray etc chris hemsworth is so badly utilised with most of his dialogue just being extremely stupid which i get is the point its just not funny and the only joke thats repeated to death is that hes hot yet stupid out of all the new characters patricia is the only interesting one and provides the only jokes that didnt have awful deliveries and werent just pure cringe and jillian was the only other one i could stand although she wasnt that special and just a character trope of the awkward talker the only interesting idea this film explores is the battle for not just being taken as frauds or hoaxes but it gets overplayed and boring by the end overall not worth a watch as everything about this film is inferior and lazy like even the ecto1 looks so much worse even if that is just a nitpick
Jun 13 2022,negative,did not liked it is not worth watching
Jun 7 2022,negative,terrible movie  the writing what little there is makes no real sense  the ending was never set up earlier so it just kinda comes out of left field  the whole we dont need to stand on the shoulders of the previous movies and then gives just about all of the previous cast cameos  as well as the first trailer sounding more like a sequel than a stand alone moviereboot      the only reason i give it 2 stars and not 1 is because of kate mckinnon  she was the only one that felt like a ghostbuster even if the jokeshumor was not for me
Jun 4 2022,positive,i know a lot of people didnt like it because its clearly a clone but i find it a decent movie that never aims to repeat the original success well maybe in the mind of the producers and is enough lighthearted to get beyond the threshold of a pure clone and a parody if itd been done in the 80s it would have been well welcomed even if it wouldnt have been a trademark of that movie decade so i approve it and i put it out of a useless confront with the originals
Jun 1 2022,positive,the movie may be way worse compared to the original ghostbusters but it manages to have its moments throughout
May 29 2022,negative,ohmy godnever have i seen a movie that offered so much of everything i hate in a film and combined them together to result in pure cringe the first two were already bad to begin with but thisno never coming back
May 29 2022,negative,ive seen bad movies before but wow
May 15 2022,positive,i thought it was really good  too bad all the chauvinists went crazy over a female cast and ruined the possibility of a sequel
May 14 2022,negative,wow what a load of rubbish was expecting it to be really bad and put of watching for ages because of it  but dame it was even worse then i could of imagined
Apr 28 2022,positive,melisaaaaaas is lord lord yum and sonic is the lord king king of north north
Apr 28 2022,negative,i like women i like movies with women in them as main characters i am a woman but this movie is a comedy and its anything but i guess thats what you get when you dont actually have an expertly crafted funny script but instead a bunch of toddlers in adult bodies doing improv without any direction
Apr 25 2022,negative,such a waste of amazing talent it is sad that with an all star all female ghostbusters team the only funny one was their male receptionist even bill murray wasnt funny and that takes serious tryingpun intended  the best acting was from the critics padding their reviews or outright pretending to like this garbage to avoid getting cancelled
Apr 23 2022,negative,relies entirely upon audience nostalgia and fundamentally void of a nuanced understanding of what made the original great everything falls flat as if were seeing an alien or computers interpretation of the source material  no soul just noise
Apr 19 2022,positive,6 years later i can definitely say that this movie is not as bad as we all whined about it being when it came out there is nothing particularly great about it but it is far from a cinematic offense the actors performed just as well as one would expect though ive never quite been a fan of mccarthys humor nor acting the movie to me fails to have any powerful moments like its predecessor we are going to ignore ghostbusters 2 but still delivers a mostly enjoyable watching experience
Apr 17 2022,negative,tired too hard was completely uneven could have forgiven both of these if it was even remotely funny the special effects were the funniest part
Apr 12 2022,negative,despite this film having an incredible cast of very talented female leads i still believe it lacks the authenticity the original managed to display the characters werent interesting and i feel they tried to hard to keep it slightly similar to the original while also drifting off into there own path which kind of created a boring and bad storyline
Mar 29 2022,negative,just a misfire on all levels one of the poorest examples of editing in a major motion picture ive ever seen
Mar 18 2022,negative,this was hard to get through was excited that maybe my daughter would have her own version of ghostbusters but even she didnt like it we ended up turning it off not funny and the special effects were dumb 
Mar 14 2022,negative,commenting on this film takes me back to the 1980s for a common short lived exclamation gag me   what is to be next from those who feel left out by what others do a female version of the great escape or mission impossible perhaps a femexpendables or just a plain female version of rocky with instead of adrianne a depressed anthony working part time as a local dogwalker cutting lawns and shoveling snow in season feeling the loser like adrianne as do so many men today  what is behind this desire to slink in under successful films cast with male character leads remake the movie with women or for that matter anyone remaking a classic old film with a poor storyline and not much that is good start to finish  why not just make a new film balances a good storyline no social point to make that moviegoers very often go to the theater to get away from good laughs in good timing and a few mild social references to wake people up after 75 minutes or so  the remake gb afterlife was fresh creative entirely original and the storyline throughout was the most entertaining part much more so than after the introduction of the notman  notwoman god who seemed after being freed from years of captivity to want to sit between its two gatekeepers and perhaps postulate what now to do  originality is key with the film industry in the 2000s and it is sorely lacking especially with remakes
Mar 5 2022,negative,the directors nostalgia for the original was not enough to make sequel that could stand on its own   i wanted to like it  but the sum total of this talented cast was not equal to the task  too bad
Mar 5 2022,negative,what more to say it is lazy and has none of the charm of the original i like kristin wiig a lot hopefully she got paid well for this atrocity
Feb 16 2022,positive,i dont care what people say about ghostbusters 2016 it was an amazing movie
Feb 15 2022,neutral,not as bad as i was expecting is not the best way to start a review shame the reputation came before the film its actually quite funny and has some tense and exciting moments it is a very slick production the tacky undertones of the original are no longer there maybe in 5 years this will become a guilty pleasure
Feb 11 2022,positive,we rewatched this in prep for afterlife i still love most of this movie but didnt need the inappropriate moments and language the chemistry this cast has on screen is wonderful to watch and the effects are fun and effective even today
Feb 9 2022,neutral,fun but disconnected from the original movies that alone makes the film inconclusive for fans
Feb 4 2022,positive,this movie is fine as a stand alone but shame shame shame to try and compare to the originals and after seeing after life i include it as well for one simple reason it was true
Jan 28 2022,negative,overly used special effects to cover up for poor performance
Jan 27 2022,negative,i tried i swear i really tried this movie is a shame for the cinema industry a shame for women a shame for men a shame for this franchise a shame for the city of new york a shame for humor and a shame for all existing form of intelligence on earth    its a kind of analogy of idiocracy take two very good movies of the 80s which are smart fun and classy and look at what it became few decades later a totaly dumb and stupid spectacle with terrible jokes and farts    i facepalmed myself a dozen of times during this thing pathetic
Jan 22 2022,negative,i had to see it for myself     its unentertaining garbadge the jokes arent funny and many are sexist the plot is stretched and a lame rippoff of the first one there is never any real conflict
Jan 21 2022,negative,i think its a downright terrible movie very badly written thoroughly unfunny obnoxious uncreative its honestly an insult to the original
Jan 19 2022,negative,just here to counter the latest round of afterlife haters this movie is garbage
Jan 18 2022,negative,this movie epically fails to capture the nostalgic feeling we get in ghostbusters afterlife if your expecting what the fanbase has come to love you wont get theres very little good humor jokes but that should come as no surprise when the actors ad lib there lines
Jan 17 2022,negative,ghostbusters 2016 answer the call is a massive failure when you mix c and d list actorsactresses with a director who doesnt have a single hit to their credits this movie is what you get there is too much talking trying to explain every little detail about this or that instead of the action that the first two movies were known for
Jan 16 2022,positive,loved this crew of ghostbusters with chris h as the fun bimbo we had some good laughs and great memories of the original ghostbusters     while it didnt reduce the enjoyment at all i had hoped the new characters would have somehow been set in the original ghostbusters universe
Jan 15 2022,negative,ghostbusters 2016 is a reboot of the original ghostbusters from the eighties which this movie succeeds at doing the problem is thats all it succeeds at doing
Jan 15 2022,negative,absolutely terrible the script is awful the acting was phoned in by a cast that were obviously just there to pick up the pay cheque and the direction is just about adequate the camera is at least pointing in the right direction  the film is an embarrassment to the female cast who are completely 2 dimensional versions of humans the jokes are all made at their expense and there is now an even remotely strong or well rounded character amongst them there have some truely terrible remakes and reboots but this is streets ahead
Jan 12 2022,positive,really funny film that brings ghostbusters into the 21st century it had good pacing and the main cast were all great had some nice nods to the original but not too much that it overwhelms the rest of the movie
Jan 9 2022,positive,this reinvention is hilarious and far better than the lazy 2022 remake that recycles the entire original films plot with an implausible storyline this movie is very funny and also original when very little in hollywood is these days love it 
Jan 9 2022,negative,with the cast that this movie had lined up it could have been great but with the horrible writing and misuse of the original ghostbusters cast this movie falls flat on its face
Jan 8 2022,positive,one of my personal favorite
Jan 8 2022,positive,nothing original here but fun watching nonetheless
Jan 7 2022,negative,absolutely terrible   an attempt to cash in on the immense success of the first two legendary movies but it just could not even remotely live up to it   i just hope that its never mentioned ever again let alone included in ghostbuster box sets when they become available now that afterlife has come out
Jan 7 2022,negative,bad delivery bad script should never have been made evidently im not the only one that thinks so
Jan 7 2022,positive,this film is in direct completion with the original which unfortunately suffers from a lack of creativity 
Jan 7 2022,negative,there arent any movies in a franchise that go clear out of their way to denigrate and insult its core fanbase in a way that this ghostbusters movie angles to do to  if you are a fan of original ghostbusters media be it the original movies the real ghostbusters animated cartoon or any of the franchises games this movies actors producers and directors make damn sure to tell you constantly throughout the film that this movie wasnt made to satisfy you  on the other hand if youre a progressive liberal who hates original ideas and wants to see any longlasting legacies be injected with an overdose gender politics and emasculative emoting then this ghostbusters movie will without a doubt answer your call with a bloodcurdling shriek so loud that it helped donald trump win a presidential election
Jan 6 2022,positive,hilarious and awesome way better than afterlife perfect casting women led movies definitely get harsher criticism its getting obvious too
Jan 5 2022,negative,exceptionally unfunny and cringy
Jan 5 2022,negative,terrible acting terrible story doesnt capture the feeling of the originals
Jan 4 2022,negative,if you can pass the point where you can forget those movies just rape the original material youll just realise they are just random average bad movies    yes they ruin your childhood memories but franckly who cares anymore you are old nobody gives a fuck about your feelings    and as bad as they are as unfaithfull as they are your 12 years old teenage daughter will prefer ghosbusters 2016 to the old dusty original version from 1984    because for people born in the 21 century bad movies are the new good    the occidental civilisation is dying your culture hit a deadend and it shows
Jan 2 2022,negative,every time i got so bored ready to turn this off something slightly less boring came up to make me keep watching  seems the creators have excelled at that  made me waste 77 minutes of my life i am not afraid to watch movies where people cant agree if they are bad or good but in this case i must admit i should have believed the bad reviews
Jan 1 2022,positive,ghostbusters later marketed as ghostbusters answer the call is a 2016 american supernatural comedy film directed by paul feig      its ok but i feel mixed about this one   id recommend it if you like this genre but if not then probably give it a miss     who you gonna call
Jan 1 2022,negative,this movie was bad the only funny person was thor you have a cast of great comedians and you put this out wow major disappointment
Dec 31 2021,negative,script and humor was pretty horrible  like the mr bean version of the original
Dec 31 2021,negative,this is so bad on so many levels i love ghostbusters and snl but this is just a waste of time for everybody never gonna see this again
Dec 31 2021,negative,wretched i enjoyed maybe 5 minutes of this movie nothing that happens makes any sense why are there ghost dragons how can they afford to make all this cutting edge equipment how is the bad guy so powerful its just an endless stream on unfunny nonsense that insults the brand at every possible turn
Dec 30 2021,negative,theres a couple funny scenes however most of the comedy seemed forced the movie seemed to be an offensive joke towards the original
Dec 29 2021,negative,entertaining but rubbish the director completely missed the point of the ghostbusters franchise im not going to slag it off as many have already done so but my reasons for the 1 and half stars are positive  entertaining if you switch your brain off negatives  poor casting although kristen wigg would have been a great choice if used correctly just one long snl sketch rubbish effects story was nonsense and the cast shouting all the time made me angry and want to punch the tv  no i didnt watch it at the cinema thank god
Dec 28 2021,negative,this abomination is garbage and i live during female characters one of my favorites was long kids goodnight with geena davis and samuel l jackson i loved the new tomb raider movie i even liked black widow but this is garbage and has nothing to do with misogyny there just awful in this movie
Dec 28 2021,negative,straight garbage a massive slap in the face to the fans of the first 2 films it even fails as a comedy film
Dec 27 2021,negative,boring bad jokes which were not funny annoying actors made it a pain to watch
Dec 27 2021,negative,a reshuffle of the original movie with a female cast how original i wanted to love this as much as the original and sequel but i just cant get on board with redoing the same movie that already exists
Dec 27 2021,negative,the original ghostbusters had very little science talk 2016 thinks it was a good idea to fill every second of screen time explaining science theres no plot  it rambles along til a very terrible ending even if it was an all male cast it would still be terrible
Dec 27 2021,negative,dumb jokes lame plot lead actors all doing the same schtick theyve done in previous roles no fun at all
Dec 27 2021,negative,it plays like its aimed at 6 year olds but has content probably not suitable for kids that age this begs the question who were they aiming this film at adults with the mind of a 6 year old its greatest sin is it makes ghostbusters ii look genius avoid
Dec 27 2021,positive,seriously funny  great job ladies 
Dec 25 2021,negative,thankfully it did not take me long before i stopped watching it once i realized i was not going to get my wasted time back
Dec 24 2021,negative,this was a horrible film  it wasnt funny  i just feel like the director didnt seem to understand that ghostbusters is a horror film with funny elements the tone of this film  it feels divergent from the tone and was blown away by watching the first woman flying around as she fires off the blaster and flies around like a balloon in a way that would have left her seriously injured in what had to be what sums up this movies intelligence   there are children shows with stronger writing which is a shame because i love kristen and think she has so much potential  such a bad movie in my bottom 20 of movies for sure
Dec 23 2021,negative,not funny despite a strong cast terrible cgi inferior to the original in every way
Dec 23 2021,negative,this movie was legitimately terrible  plot acting and pacing were all horrendous  cgi was good though
Dec 23 2021,negative,this movie honestly was really disappointing and bears no resemblance to the original two movies it is a ghostbusters flick in name only
Dec 21 2021,negative,four wonderful actresses talents wasted on two hours of cringe the opening was promising but then it was all downhill from there im going to look up whomever wrote this script so that i can avoid sitting through any dialog they wrote ever again
Dec 20 2021,negative,what is this inititially when i heard they were rebooting ghostbusters i was excited being a child of the 80s the movies and cartoon were my favorite things ever and i was happy to hear they were going to be bringing it back for future generations   how wrong i was    on paper this is one of the strongest casts in movies recently and i thought it was going to be amazing all these actresses have the ability to make amazing and fun movies however i do not feel that it was the actors that ruined this movie it was the studio and the writing this was such a clustered mess of complete nonsense and stereotypes that i couldnt finish this movie in one sitting     the comedy mostly falls flat and barely merits a chuckle i almost feel like it was forced and not done up to par of what is shouldve and couldve been with this cast this movie had the potential to be one of the best comedies of this generation     sometimes it felt like the actors were just there for a paycheck and not to make a movie i am not going to go into anymore details besides saying this is bad because that is a understatement
Dec 19 2021,positive,lots of laugh out loud moments great addition to a great franchise
Dec 17 2021,negative,movie was ok female case did not make this a good or bad movie     only 2 things made this a forgettable movie poor writing and its a remake anytime you take a popular franchise completely throw out the canon and start from scratch thats a recipe for disaster had this movie simply been a sequel and had acknowledged what had come before it i am sure it would have been received more favorably but since it had to get rid of what the fans cared about it will only ever be remember as a bad remake no one had asked for and for all the morons who falsely thought all the hate was caused by the gender of the main cast members
Dec 13 2021,negative,contrary to popular opinion i dont think the grotesque leslie jones sank this movie i believe it was ms mccarthy  melissa is a onetrick pony and the glue factory is beckoning
Dec 8 2021,negative,i really dont think i have to explain why this movie does not even get 1 star  very bad acting woke lecture bad cast not a great story and stupid jokes
Dec 8 2021,negative,although i dont enjoy the cast or its story something about it makes it pass the time and watchable
Dec 7 2021,negative,did not like this at all the only funny part in this movie was chris hemsworth  this should not hav been made or had the name ghostbusters put on it
Dec 6 2021,negative,story drags funny jokes were not funny wrongweak female cast selection poorly written script alot of unnecessary inflated technical terms explanations that doesnt really explain anything its amazing how they can get this so wrong
Dec 6 2021,positive,i was very happy with this remake which could have been and should have been a part 3 to the original series  an all girl cast made me feel seen and wanted as a long time mega ghostbuster fan now they make womens ghostbuster costumes that look like real cosplay costumes this opened up a whole world for young girls to see themselves in a cool fictional world if only afterlife had acknowledged it
Dec 6 2021,negative,really bad  lots of feminist rubbish to bash and attack the franchise break it down  etc      attacks on white males continue as well the  movie shouldnt  exist because its propaganda
Dec 5 2021,negative,i watched this a few years ago to see what all the noise was about with this female led ghostbusters it was okish doubt id bother to watch it again as i dont remember it being particularly funny or adding anything new other than better cgi could have been so much more
Dec 5 2021,negative,felt like an snl episode slapstick style humor a parody of ghostbusters
Dec 4 2021,negative,lazy joke writing  not a fan of kristen wiig she was on par  mckinnons mccarthy and jones comedic talents were wasted  the humor was needlessly crass chris character was a laugh for a scene then just became tired  the entire movie was wrapped up in a movie made for the wrong reasons
Dec 4 2021,negative,the idea of a new remake with a new cast especially one with the most female comedians of the day had such potential it just wasnt funny though which for a comedy ruins the whole thing strangely the most entertaining part was hemsworth though he was playing the most extreme example of the ditzy secretary trope and was meant to be mocked he was actually hilarious despite the material
Dec 4 2021,negative,this was a dumpster fire and insulting to almost every segment of society through poorly conceived stereotypes and just horribly offensive jokes
Dec 3 2021,negative,i honestly love the performers but the movie just doesnt really work it took me a while to think of why comedy works when a normal character is put in a wacky situation or a wacky character is put in a normal situation if you put wacky characters in a wacky situation its cartoonish nonsense the reason why ghostbusters 84 worked was that it transcended the sillyforthesakeofsilliness of many snl skits while the characters mightve been goofy nerdy or selfserving the viewer at least understood the characters motivation vs the character of kevin  all of that said if you generally find the unremarkable nature of most snl skits hilarious this movie is probably right up your alley
Dec 3 2021,negative,a travesty of a film im all for new generations being introduced to classic ip but dont dishonour and sneer at the original films to try to raise yours above them why were the first films good they had excellent writing comic timing and polished crafted dialogue the plot made sense there was set up and pay off well executed scenes photography and a glorious score  this 2016 dumpster fire has none of this just loud brash adlibbing no character depth nonsensical villain it seems to have been written by a child whos never seen the originals this is not a film but an exemplar of how to cash grab with abject distain for the creative skills for their forebears
Dec 3 2021,positive,ghostbusters reboot is good the performances are very good and the idea of the womens team is wonderful the problem is that the script doesnt care much for details the villain is an idiot and lacks polish 710
Dec 2 2021,negative,this felt more like a scooby do movie than a ghostbusters movie humour levels were pretty much exactly the same as the scooby do movies too   poor pass off of a movie in this franchise
Dec 2 2021,negative,you might aswell call this bridesmaids 2 its got ghosts in it     if you survive more the 1520min into this film then yourre either brave or stupid  you know a movie is not going to go well when its directed by the nerdy one from snow patrol    terrible
Dec 2 2021,negative,it is ok if you forget the original movies and take the movie on its own it is ok if you try to compare it to the originals then it is not worth watching
Dec 1 2021,negative,go see ghostbusters afterlife great movie i am glad i saw it great  3rd movie to ghostbusters franchise it was way better than 2016 s abysmal attempt 2016 was a rehash of the first movie which did not need remaking
Dec 1 2021,negative,this movie sucked its just a mess   the cast was not the problem the movie drags the directing was crap the story is not that good the over feel of the movie is well crap   the original movies where much better   this could have been good but just isnt
Dec 1 2021,negative,ghostbusters 2016 the movie that will go down in history as one of the worst adaptations remakes reboots or whatever this movie wanted to be but overall one of the worst movies ive ever seen in my life simply seeing the poster makes me want to vomit     its hard for me to describe the abomination that this movie was i think it takes talent to take one of the most beloved movies of all time chew it up regurgitate it throw it up and write something so bad then film it and have the courage to release it and to add to the burn saying that you improved it by correcting the original true story that is talent or it is simply the result of being so disconnected from reality and what you are doing either of the two is simply incredible to me    this film is the equivalent of that person that you have surely met at some time in your life and who thinks that it is funny for humiliating itself in a way that makes others feel sorry and that is that at some point people will laugh a little but its not with you its about you and no not even this movie reaches the level of those kind of its so bad its good movies you just want to stop watching it look away from this car crash that is ghostbusters 2016 known now as the female ghostbusters because really thats what it is a cheap attempt to capitalize on diehard fans of the franchise where their only attempt of input of a new idea was to say so how about we take all the characters and make them women  and then executive turned their heads and said brilliant give this person a medal and a cookie     this movie even led me to coin in my vocabulary what i would call the ghostbusters effect 2016 an effect that although i had already seen it many times before i had never been so disgusted as with this film thats why it deserves to be named after it    the ghostbusters effect 2016 i describe it vaguely as the need for studios to quickly and cheaply capitalize on past glories trampling on the years it took for an original ip to build a legacy that has lasted decades this through a remake reboot or pseudosequel where generally the people in charge of creating the magic that would bring the original to life are not involved in the project and where a pretentious director  director writers believe they are literally correcting the story where are you people do not have the humility to recognize that they are standing on the shoulders of giants people who with nothing more than a vague idea and a lot of talent and creativity managed to create something memorable and that would become part of popular culture and where are you people they dont have the slightest idea of what made that story that idea that memorable and endearing franchise in the first place and above all the hypocrisy of the exploitation of the fans of yesteryear who first desperately try to appeal to them but the moment they see through their facade of smoke and mirrors and reject the product they turn against them attacking them and trying to shame them looking for the grossest excuses to justify their failed project their failed scam and that is that the fan does not know exactly what he wants but he knows what is good when he sees it and he also knows how to identify a impostor to a wannabe when he wants to present himself to be the new replacement in addition to presenting himself as the new and improved way saying ive come to correct everything look at me im better and if the fan doesnt like it the creators directors and actors will call fans back for not liking it true story creating this environment where instead of the product being worthy enough for the viewer to invest their hardearned money and take ho irreplaceable ras of his life in it now the fan must be worthy enough to see his movie true story that and more is what i vaguely describe as the ghostbusters effect 2016    there is not much to add about the movie itself it is an imitation of the original with a genderswap gender change where they wanted to take the archetype of each character deconstruct them and make them funny although the comedy here seems written by a child a child not at all funny who may not have many friends as it seems that he does not understand what human interaction is like and subsequently does not understand what is funny and what is not the story is an amalgamation not to say that they took film 1 and 2 ate it and vomited it of the two original films but delivering a completely inferior product where there is also a clear very marked inclination of identity politics for those who have seen it they will already know what i mean a little formula that has been repeated a lot in all films of this type in recent years and not to mention the protagonists in themselves noneshe delivers a good performance and none of them have a gram of comedy in them especially melissa mccarthy i dont like her pseudocomedy but still they want to get her into this kind of thing with kristen wiig i have no major problem in this genre it has always been made to me as a passive punching bag it receives jokes but does not give them and here it is no exception and the other two actresses i do not know who they were and i have no intention of seeing them in anything else  the same an exaggeration of the characters that they are supposed to want to be and well chris hemsworth only comes out because you have to put a aaa star that attracts people who do not know what ghostbusters is and know him for thor and not to mention the cameos of the main characters i can only say that it clearly represents what this movie is    i can only say stay away from the movie at all costs if you havent seen it yet take a better look at the originals if you really want to experience ghostbusters  
Nov 30 2021,negative,like most of the cast in other things but they just didnt turn out a good movie this time
Nov 30 2021,negative,35    before release it was obvious that ghostbusters 2016 was a clear cash grab as it reboots a beloved 80s film which holds up well to this day while the advances of technology and cgi since ghostbusters 1984 was released besides that this reboot is far from capturing any sort of quality that the original has maintained over such a long time     ghostbusters 2016 tries to capture a more quirky and comedybased story however it is all too much as the characters are constantly irritating and their humour is so cliche and drawn out that a lot of scenes are painful to sit through instead of focusing on the story of forming this group of people into ghostbusters this reboot instead lets the comedy take centre stage pushing the story and logic to the side where it just brushes over certain details and moves far too quickly to get invested    the intentions of rebooting a beloved classic is to improve on aspects as the time has passed ghostbusters 2016 establishes that this is truly a reboot as the knowledge of ghosts is unknown however this film cant hold back from standing on its own and instead draws in ridiculously outofplace easter eggs and cameos just for fan service    this film is disgraceful standing alongside the original as it contains some horrific writing and jokes which are painfully awful
Nov 30 2021,positive,watchable over and over and still remains funny i love it
Nov 29 2021,negative,not very funny also the secretary character was annoying
Nov 29 2021,negative,such a horribly unfunny movie  i actually watched this twice with the hopes that i might have missed something but it really was not funny
Nov 28 2021,negative,this was not an enjoyable experience the jokes were tedious obnoxious pathetic and felt like they were insulting the audiences intelligence
Nov 28 2021,positive,the biggest mistake they made with this movie was trying to erase the original they could have easily made this same exact movie and just based it in boston where it was actually shot and had the allfemale cast start their ghostbusters there keeping the original story intact and also preserving this film among the cannon of gb films     that being said as a comedy this movie is quite funny kate mckinnon is hysterical with her realghostbustersegonlooking holtzman character shes weird and really funny theres plenty of jokes and most of them land if you view it independently as just a comedy film its great it just should not have been a reboot they basically dug their own grave by doing this
Nov 28 2021,negative,010 possibly the worst shit ive ever seen i want back that hour and a half of my life this movie gives me actual brain damage the jokes are face palming id rather shoot myself then watch this terrible shit again
Nov 27 2021,negative,i saw this at the movies as a big ghostbusters fan i had to make up my own mind even with all the negative reviews  1st 5 mins was great  after that it was one of the worst movies i ever watched god awful jokes like a 5 year old would write  i was never against all female ghostbusters group but it was so poorly written and directed and story what story  brides maids was amazing i thought if its anything like that im going to love it  i like every ghostbuster except the blackchick she was beyond bad    what ever happened to story coming 1st before your dumb agendas
Nov 27 2021,negative,the kids liked it i would have loved the humour in this when i was 8 at 40 though it wasnt for me
Nov 27 2021,negative,it was a big joke to the franchise that they kept calling a sequel but really a reboot everything was just over the top not a good movie
Nov 27 2021,negative,i had high hopes for this movie and was extremely let down terrible story line followed up with forced awful acting a few good moments but i wont waste my time watching it again
Nov 26 2021,negative,not original  not funny  no care into the products   a bit sexist  movie drag on  on
Nov 26 2021,positive,unlike a lot of the internet trolls i liked this movie but with a big caveat i absolutely hated that they chose to ignore the original mythology laid down by ghostbusters 1 and 2 i dont think this story would have been significantly different had they acknowledged that the manhattan cross rip and vigo and the og ghostbusters had existed if anything there are a thousand ways you could have explained how ghostbusters was now a franchised business that would have kept this movie squarely focused on kristen wiig melissa mccarthy leslie jones and the comedically immortal kate mckinnon who is absolutely a national treasure and far and away my favorite character in this film the cutfortime dance number at the end was questionable but at the same time were watching a movie about four people who go into business catching ghosts i think if were going to suspend disbelief we need to suspend all the way    i think this is one of those movies that under different circumstances might have found its footing and done quite well but i also think that the two things that conspired against it were insurmountable 1 they ignored the original continuity 2 through no fault of their own they became a proxy for the battle between hillary clinton and donald trump in 2016  which was a total bummer ultimately i would love to have seen more of these characters and i left the theater happy with the experience even though not in the way i wanted ultimately though life is full of moments like that and they tend to lead to new experiences that will sometimes produce memories and moments youll enjoy more as an adult since the things that inspired you as a kid rarely do when youre grown as they say you can never go back home
Nov 26 2021,negative,terrible film id say it was based on a bad script but im pretty sure nobody even read the script to begin with     all 4 women play the comic relief in the film which is a big part of the problem the villain is awful and forgettable honestly i had to google him because i forgot who he even was and his motivationplan is just stupid the comedy is bottom of the barrel garbage with fartqueef jokes 3 separate jokes about soup and the ott equipment test scene    i think these women deserved better
Nov 26 2021,negative,gave it one star because i liked kate mckinnon and leslie jones characters sadly the film is garbage and to have cameos from the original ghostbusters not playing ghostbusters was simply dumb
Nov 25 2021,positive,this film doesnt work at all as a feministic reboot of the sciencefiction classic ghostbusters yet works excitingly well as a comedy which best part is a dumb chris hemsworth which is kind of ironic regarding the direction the movie took
Nov 25 2021,negative,this is not good or even near it  you know it and i know it  woke tries and woke fails  not funny at all and not even capable of being entertainment  i want my time back
Nov 24 2021,positive,funnier than a lot of people are willing to admit or consider in some ways better than the original in other ways just as good
Nov 24 2021,negative,everyone i watched this unholy creation with thought it was horrible every male character was either an idiot or an asshole this movie is very man hating and it should have never been made the only good thing about this parody of the original was all the ghost hunting tech they had which wasnt in the original yet this is supposed to be a reboot of it this felt like watching a desperate house wives episode with a ghostbusters theme to it never and i do mean never do this sort of thing again to a beloved franchise that everyone holds dear to their hearts
Nov 24 2021,positive,by far one of the greatest comedies of all time
Nov 24 2021,positive,decently fun better than a lot of people said im between 3 and 35
Nov 23 2021,positive,i really wanted to like the ghostbusters reboot it has a great cast a wonderful director and an interesting premise though at times it is funny overall its just an okay film
Nov 23 2021,positive,better than expected the characters are a bit stereotypical and the colors are very in your face but the pace is good 6910
Nov 23 2021,negative,first i have to say this film is not made for me  im not a fan of slapstick humor or cringey dialog  not a fan of lowbrow humor  not a fan of melissa mccarthys brand of comedy  so this was definitely not made for me    i saw the film because daughter wanted to see it  spoiler  she didnt like it either  im not sure who it was meant to attract  certainly not men who are mercilessly degraded  not women who are looking for examples of empowerment because most of the female cast act like morons  and not fans of the original film which this film did not respect  apparently it was made for the critics who largely loved it  unfortunately critics generally see films for free so theres not much money in making a film for them    a few tips    fat jokes arent really funny anymore    running a joke out goes through stages where it might be funny at first and then it gets repetitious and then the fact its being repeated is funny in and of itself  but you have to stop the joke before people start checking for the exits  which wasnt done in this case    the film is colorful and a lot happens  thats pretty much all that can be said for it  by the next day i couldnt exactly remember what i had seen except for a few parts here and there that i desperately wanted to forget
Nov 23 2021,negative,really painful to sit through no issue with all female cast but an abysmal effort for ghostbusters fans
Nov 23 2021,negative,wonderful actors in this movie terrible idea to reboot something that is as iconic as this franchise never shouldve been made as a reboot 
Nov 23 2021,positive,in my opinion it was actually a pretty good movie i see why some people dont like it much but when you take into consideration that the events in this movie take place in an alternate universe it actually makes some sense the animation is also really good ive watched this movie countless times and i didnt notice any major errors that would affect ones viewing experience overall i give this movie 35 would recommend giving it a go
Nov 23 2021,negative,a mockery of a cinematic masterpiece
Nov 23 2021,positive,ive never understood why this film never got a sequel i thought it was hilariously entertaining its a comedic masterpiece with amazing cgi and effects its a great original story with some fantastic easter eggs and cameos
Nov 23 2021,negative,like spitting right in the face of my childhood  being completely objective this movie was awful factoring in my love of the original ghostbusters this movie made me want to die
Nov 23 2021,negative,couldnt make it through the whole movie
Nov 23 2021,positive,ive never laughed out loud in a movie theatre before or since i laughed my a off at the crazy humor and insane dialogue in this movie  one of my all time favorites  i loved the original ghostbusters and loved the easter egg moments where a former cast member would waltz into the movie  just hilarious    wasnt a huge fan of the 2021 ghostbusters  it was just ok
Nov 23 2021,negative,absolutely terrible movie not entertaining at all very goofy but not in a good way
Nov 23 2021,negative,they ruined the song and definetly an easy cashgrab
Nov 22 2021,negative,when there are 4 funny people and the movie is not funny well thats a problem couldnt stand this movie was dumb and not mildly entertaining the only bright spot of this entire movie was chris helmsworth other than that ignore this trash
Nov 22 2021,negative,im sorry but to me this really does feel like they turned this into adam sandler movie token black women in stereotype role why could they of not made her a scientist barf joke right of the bat and reference to the original ghostbusters that do not exist in this universe also sorry but a lot of the ghosts look like something i expect from a video game the original was creepy and a little scary this is neither  disappointed they wasted such a talented cast
Nov 22 2021,negative,this film has zero comedy elements it feels like it was made by a bunch of hyperactive toddles that once saw the original ghostbusters films     the original cast show up and are given terrible cameo roles which is frankly disrespectful     aweful waste of time real shame as the cast are great in other things
Nov 22 2021,negative,on paper this movie shouldve been a slam dunk it sports a terrific cast of very talented  female comedians plus cameos from most of the surviving cast members including bill murray himself the movie however is just not very good or funny  in fact i cant recall a single funny part in the entire filmbut rather quite a few missed opportunities
Nov 21 2021,negative,tried watching this in the cinema i walked out at the exorcist head turn my girlfriend asked me to watch it before we watched gbafterlife she asked me why there was a running won ton soup joke that wasnt funny the 1st time
Nov 21 2021,negative,this movie was nothing more than a remake of the first movie but with a weak female cast  it was like a bridesmaids crossover  funny actresses forced into a bad remake
Nov 21 2021,neutral,kate mckinnon was the only character that i found remotely interesting this movie was an absolute waste of great casting whoever wrote this didnt even try for an original or unique plot none of the humor lands and the whole movie presents itself as directionless its not as awful as it gets made out to be but theres no purpose for its existence subpar 510
Nov 21 2021,negative,a truly unenjoyable and frankly disgusting experience   not a single redeeming factor to this film
Nov 21 2021,negative,this was a movie that is absolutely ruined by its complete inability to shut the hell up for two seconds to let any of the jokes to land or any of the creepy things feel creepy  great cast but theyre completely wasted on terrible adlibbing rather than an actual script that plays to each of their particular talents  the humor is far too low brow for my taste  it was just a very long and painful movie to sit through because it just wasnt funny or entertaining because of all of the horrible adlibbing and complete lack of a script the cast was the best part but they literally had nothing to work with but i do have to take issue with them calling me a basement dwelling manbaby for thinking the movie looked like garbage  because it was garbage and it had nothing to do with what the cast happens to have between their legs
Nov 20 2021,negative,i finally watched it to see if it was as bad as people claim and i gotta saykinda im one of those people that thought the original was ok not a bad movie but also not some kind of masterpiece this movie 2016 just isnt funny and i think a lot of the hate stems from the fact that the ladies do things men could never get away with imagine bill murray and company blasting gozer in the breasts or crotch or imagine the og cast hitting on their secretary 2016 proudly proclaims that it will do all the things men do in the world but it forgets the old valuable lesson that two wrongs dont make a right
Nov 20 2021,negative,not one i will watch with my kids again probably at all even we did have a nice conversation about what flipping the bird was a new sign they thought was entertaining that they learned from this movie as a women it does not make me feel empowered to watch movies like this where we are ment to be important but just end up embarrassing they should stop making remakes pushing females because the male version did well im happy i did not pay anything extra to watch this included in a subscription but if i had i would likley ask for my money back
Nov 20 2021,negative,ok re watching this i prefer afterlife while i think neither movie is fantastic i think this movie could and should have been something very different and would likely of meant afterlife would not have been made i dont think answer the call deserves quite the level of shade it got but its really not that great a little flat and painful for me but ive seen much worse
Nov 20 2021,negative,even though the cgi and the action is a bit better the cast lacks the charm the story lacks the uniqueness and the comedy lacks the wit that made all the previous ghostbusters movies work i tried to give this film a second chance though the film is just simply not funny it gets very slow and there is not thrill to watch this boring cast of characters give their typical comedy for the record i dont think it fails because of its female cast it was just a reboot that could not compare to the original in any way overall if you loved the original ghostbusters films like i did chances are you wont really like this one
Nov 20 2021,negative,unfunny waste of time
Nov 20 2021,negative,ghostbusters is a reboot of the old classic films ghostbusters 198489 films with unimaginable for that time special effects play their role what can not be said about the new film    despite the publics love for various scandalous showdowns thanks to which the sony pictures film company has successfully promoted its products more than once but in this case this technique failed and the wheel of repression which the company swept over the original director ivan reitman met with an extremely negative reaction and rebuff from the fans who not only considered the replacement of reitman with paul fig unequal but already spread waves of hatred towards him in advance not yet released film the gender reassignment of the main characters only added fuel to the fire and the flames consumed the entire creative process and constant criticism of a dark cloud hung over the creators which eventually led to failure    despite the opposite opinions about the film the truth as usual is somewhere between an angel and a devil  in the middle moving away from all the scandals discarding the unpopular decision to change the sex of the heroes finally forgetting the original  you can make up your own still extremely subjective opinion    the plot of the reboot duplicates the original and tells us about how four partners decided to start hunting the evil spirits that appeared on the streets of new york naturally the first thing for newly minted ghost hunters is a powerful spirit who decides to destroy all life on earth yes it will not do without the marshmallow man whose appearance in the film finally convinced the writers of the complete creative impotence    i consider paul feig to be a mediocre director no film of which falls short of the good bar but hangs somewhere in the lower end of the rating scale weak in all respects both in the work with the staff and in the interaction with the scenery but he still shot several highprofile hits starring melissa mccarthy this madame is the owner of dubious acting data but is in the center of the artificially created hype around her person the only remarkable feature of her image is speculation on the topic of excess weight  always everywhere and in everything    chris hemsworth once again proved that hollywood does not need him outside the image of the god of thunder it represents the directors taunting of men which again is very strange paul is personally responsible for gender changes citing past difficulties in communicating with his gender according to his stories he was often bullied from time to time the contradiction lies in the fact that feig endowed the main characters with masculine qualities and concentrated stereotypes about female behavior in hemsworths character thereby recognizing the superiority of the stronger sex and humiliating the female part of the planets population but lets leave this topic especially since this is not the most nightmare in the film    childrens dialogues only these children speak scientific and pseudoscientific words so that we think that the main characters are very smart people but this feeling immediately disappears and lucky those who have it at all because their statements are ridiculously implausible    since this is a comedy by definition there should be jokes in it  it should be funny for us but the jokes from this movie literally make you sick vomiting mucus of unknown origin inappropriate sounds etc plus there are a lot of vulgar jokes that are either simply stupid or nonaesthetic no there are positive aspects but they are completely inappropriate and are more suitable for youth comedies selfirony is present so it was very helpful and in some places sounded funny    paul feig crossed out with a bold line everything for which the original dilogy was so loved unfunny jokes actresses antics unconvincing computer graphics stingy production excessively rapid development of the plot  only for this one can already hate the film but the director didnt think this was enough and already from his side insults and accusations poured down towards the audience    the special effects are one big flop because with the  144 million budget they could have been made more believable there are certain colors  these are blue and green of which there are a lot that hurts the eyes there is no feeling of complete immersion    if the original ghostbusters was a harmonious and graceful combination of a comedy and a mystical thriller and adventure where humor ingeniously complemented and adorned an already interesting and exciting story then in the new film the opposite is true the authors supposedly did everything so that all the recognizable symbolism including the ghost story itself became just an excuse for the implementation of as many different gags as possible when on the contrary the plot requires capturing attention in this case and humor should be beneficial to this    there are enough actors of the first magnitude who are not clear for what reasons generally agreed to star in this film    they chose the format of the purest comedy with not a small amount of absurdity due to which the action itself sometimes tends to the absurd and is perceived almost on the verge of parody    it feels like the authors of the picture just needed money and they had a creative crisis since they could not come up with something new and interesting    the most interesting thing is that i was not negatively disposed before watching the film all this is simply striking from the first minutes    new time new team it would be nice you know if the creators showed how the new generation replaces the old one how old people pass the baton to new heroes how accumulated knowledge and the burden of responsibility are passed from one generation to the next well like in the good animated series extreme ghostbusters it would be cool right    undoubtedly the original ghostbusters was a comedy but there was a little bit of everything mixed in there there was mysticism horror fantasy and humor this is what the film won over us    here the emphasis is on the incessant moronic gags which ceased to be funny 20 years ago    well you know the woman is screaming loudly her eyes are bunching up  this is ridiculous the woman was given a kick  its ridiculous the woman fell to the floor  its ridiculous the woman was doused with rubbish from the garbage  this is funny and etc what not funny for you then you are a misogynist my friend however more on that later    there are no horrors or mystics here just stupid gags and cartoony which is multiplied by the presence of multicolored neon ghosts in the frame they wanted to make colombo but did ace ventura    the level of humor if in 2016 you are still amused by farting jokes then yes the movie is for you the rest i hasten to disappoint  the bubonic plague is funnier than this movie    when the guy said suck it and began to shake the middle finger in front of the heroines noses how funny it can be its funny if you imagine a picture of an adult filmaker who sitting and coming up with this scene for a movie    if in the original film we had bill murray lying on the floor in slime after being attacked by slimer here in our frame right in the frame a ghost opens its mouth and vomits on the main character  is it funny this is exactly what jokes evolved into in this ghostbusters    references to the original rather parasitism on the original the actors of the original were shoved into the film giving them completely different roles there is also a cameo of the building where the former ghostbusters worked so the movie kind of says see this is a reboot of the ghostbusters not a secondrate fart comedy set in a classic movie     characters having narrowed down the general atmosphere of the film the authors also rounded up the characters just to note with the relative comicity in the old 2 films people were people    here we have every character  that is elevated to the absolute cliché    the villain is just a something unexplainable what wrong has the whole world done to him how did he get all this power he literally dealt with the faceless npcs with a wave of his hand but could not repeat the same trick against the heroines i think im looking for logic in the wrong movie    misogyny the filmmakers deny that if you dont like the film youre a dumb bumpkin and sexist is it now that they justify not succesful and shitty films think about it a film in which women are portrayed with clumsy shrill stereotypes  if you dont like it then you are a misogynist and you dont like women    no gentlemen creators you made the nonsense and you still have the audacity to hide behind screams about misogynists in order to create at least some hype around the film which in fact is not worth a damn    do you know what is most interesting professional and incorruptible critics who scolded warcraft but at the same time praised this humus the bottom line the film made by the directorfan of the video game which was overseen by blizzard himself has a lower performance than the remake of this ghostbusters made by the director of comedies about clumsy fat women
Nov 20 2021,negative,worst movie ever tried to hyped with new female characters for the new generation kids to watch this felt like a reboot of the original with sucked this should of been like a multi universe like and should of waited and until the 3 installing ghostbuster afterlife with the grandkids of the original 
Nov 20 2021,negative,unfunny lack imagination a dire and poorly made attempt the far superior original
Nov 20 2021,negative,absolutely awful    basically emabressing     they totally try pissing on the original movies to swing their feminism     awful     at least afterlife did the franchise justice and harold ramis
Nov 20 2021,negative,cant say it worked most of the jokes just dont land or are too silly the villain was possibly the worst in movie history the on the whole feels like a series of skits that takes aspects from the original ghostbusters and moulds them in a unfunny mess    wanted this and ghostbusters afterlife to be better but ghostbusters 2016 just doesnt know what its trying to do or say and ends up being nothing
Nov 20 2021,positive,it was okay a bit loosey goosey didnt care for the receptionist guy part stupid and useless
Nov 20 2021,negative,a mess of a movie with very few redeeming features i even gave it a second go with the extended cut and it just wasnt a good movie
Nov 20 2021,positive,this movie was made by a talented cast and director but they were over their heads with this one its an ok movie but its not a must see
Nov 20 2021,negative,awful remake of the original
Nov 20 2021,negative,just awful  loud and annoying characters  tried to be more funny and less campy spooky like the original   dont waste your time
Nov 20 2021,negative,overall is a fun movie however shouldnt be a film called ghostbusters has no link to the originals or the cartoons really wanted to like it but wasnt for me
Nov 19 2021,negative,so bad it could have been good but too many fart jokes i think those under 6 years old may like the silly logic and dumb jokes
Nov 19 2021,negative,painful to watch i had high hopes for this movie but i was sadly disappointed the movie is almost like a parody of the first one almost everything isnt taken serious joke after joke after joke on top of a joke special effects are horrible looked shiny and like a video game its not that its women why it sucks the material they were giving is why it sucked they obviously didnt know or care anything about the franchise of ghostbusters really just a failed cash grab  just dont watch this smh
Nov 19 2021,positive,not terrible but not a true ghostbusters film
Nov 19 2021,negative,an unholy abomination  emphasis on a bomb  a smug writerdirector  uninteresting leads  supporting characters that range from annoying to obnoxious  absolutely hideous cgi  terrible jokes  the only thing ill give it credit for is some of the new particle throwers dualpistols knuckledusters were an interesting and unique idea  410  i refrained from giving it a lowerrating because i dont want to be lumped in with farright incels
Nov 19 2021,positive,absolutely amazing the cast is brilliant and the irreverence is perfect
Nov 19 2021,positive,i like the resh idea of the film the cast story and editing is great
Nov 19 2021,negative,they tried too hard to make this a genuine movie but the acting was too farce and idea was trying to project it on our face
Nov 19 2021,negative,a poor attempt of an otherwise great idea the humor is flat and anything but funny the effects looks like something out of a ps1 on an old tv set it has none of the vibes the original ghostbusters movies had  chris hemsworths character is worse than jarjar binks poorly written and executed movie
Nov 19 2021,negative,this movie was terrible it took me 3 times to watch it the effects look like a bad video game and the comedy was so bad it is an unfortunate waste of talented comedians
Nov 19 2021,negative,just trash no story forced jokes thats hardly funny bad writing huge fail
Nov 19 2021,negative,seriously what was that   to quote comic book guy from the simpsons    worse version of ghostbusters ever     i can understand what the director was going for but absolutely went off course  it lacked heart made just to cash in on the ghostbusters franchise
Nov 19 2021,negative,absolute garbage only reason it got good reviews on this site was because it has an all female cast
Nov 18 2021,positive,as a life long ghostbusters fan i for one had waited practically my whole life for a 3rd movie  although it frustrated me to no end that practically every decent enough idea fell through mostly because of the refusal of bill murray  however when we finally heard that a spinoffreboot of ghostbusters was happening i figured it was the best we were going to get for now      i know that many people were not thrilled about the idea of an allfemale team of ghostbusters but i didnt mind the idea  i went into the movie with an open mind  while the story was not too bad the ending of the movie wasnt really the best in my opinion having the antagonists i guess you could call it a destructor form be the ghost from the logo  and i know that chris hemsworth has been improving his comedy chops more and more but in this movie it just didnt feel right to me  seeing thor act like a completely airheaded jock  meh not my thing      the special effects while pretty felt like there was too much of it  now i understand what bill murray hated about ghostbusters 2 he supposedly hated that there were far too many visual effects  especially towards the end  i primarily liked the look of slimer in the original movies when he was made via practical effects  and speaking of whom slimerwith a girlfriend  yeahno      despite that my overall opinion of it is that while its definitely not as good as the first two movies its not a complete bomb of a film  i do give credit to the cast and crew because its a fun movie on its own  i just dont think it matches up as well with the original films
Nov 18 2021,negative,bad one shitpoor attempt at the reboot also for attacking fans i lower the score half the star half a star because my two young daughters semi liked it otherwise it would be 0 stars
Nov 18 2021,negative,it was a ghostbusters movie in name only and did its very best to destroy not only established canon but erase the history of the first two films this movie soley exists to give a vehicle to its stars to tear down the originals and does nothing to promote its legacy it deserves to be completely forgotten and never mentioned again it should never be used as a comparison by true fans of the franchise it was a cash grab and nothing more
Nov 18 2021,negative,stupid boring and unfunny  if you like having your intelligence insulted this movie is for you
Nov 18 2021,negative,just not good jokes arent funny the first time and they keep repeating the gag and its still not funny call backs to the original film just served as a reminder of how good that movie was and how poorly this one matches up the cast is incredibly talented and funny but the script just isnt good
Nov 18 2021,negative,this is one of the worst films i have ever seen at the cinema the humour is lazy and dumb the storyline is terrible and the female ghostbusters are just not convincing at all this film is an insult to everything the original was i want to give it zero its that bad
Nov 18 2021,negative,with such a talented cast i see no excuse for director paul feig who helped direct some episodes of the office to do this terrible with chemistry bad writing and a bland villain this movie had everything set up for it to be a good movie but it was distaterous it seems like they forgot chemistry and all four of the characters had to be some form of comic relief not everyone can be the venkmen also the jokes were more random and didnt have the same comedic value because the chemistry between the characters was bad the antagonist was so boring to watch being between cheesy and creepy i didnt know if i should take him seriously or comedically they set up a backstory that was meant to make him seem like a feel bad character but then replaced him with chris hemsworth then they just stole the final act of pixels guys if you want to reboot a franchise or start a new one you have to add quality the audience isnt that stupid and it makes me feel stupid as i was watching it i hope the cast can get another chance at a good movie together because they are very talented and deserve it this movie i thought was an absolute dumpster fire that should be a film to watch if your looking for what not to do in a comedy or scifi movie
Nov 18 2021,negative,movie has to have women reboot then men have to be stupid mean or just ignorant most of the movie actressesyell some plot bases then immediately showprove the opposite for comedic reason the pilar of ghostbuster are well cemented with some serious story and this movie breaks most of them without adding new concepts trama or plot
Nov 18 2021,negative,a fairly poor knock off of the 1984 classic movie that simply repeats the same story with a cast that has none of the chemistry of the original
Nov 18 2021,negative,disappointing and wasted opportunity for a good movie
Nov 18 2021,negative,i love ghostbusters but i didnt like this movie it wasnt even funny for me
Nov 18 2021,negative,i saw this in the movie theater because i really wanted to like it but it was bad good acting but no script jokes that missed the mark and a forgettable villain
Nov 18 2021,positive,i know a lot of people didnt like this movie but i cannot understand why its just as goofy and plotholefilled as the original just with different actors i really liked the 4 leads  hemsworth so it was a really good time for me
Nov 17 2021,negative,a feature length parody of the gb franchise fart jokes in a gb movie wtf where they thinking by not listening to the original creators star wars all over again get the kathleen kennedies of the world off my franchises
Nov 16 2021,negative,this was god awful and never should have been attempted    people arent hating on it because it has an allfemale cast theyre hating on it because it was a terrible remake    these women are funny as theyve shown on snl this movie wasnt    get over it and stop thinking the world just hates on anything with an allfemale cast
Nov 16 2021,negative,the movie was filled with too many comedians and not enough story there was too much going on and it was filled to the brim with unnecessary guest stars trying to get a one liner in i literally stopped watching halfway through it was that bad it felt like a low quality saturday morning cartoon
Nov 16 2021,negative,i think this would have been better if they had just made their own thing and not tried to remake the original movie  the original ghostbusters was not a comedy first and foremost it was a scifi horror laced with some dry humor and a few gags  it was a lot of exposition and a lot of time was spent in building on the details of the science to make it seem believable  this movie is basically standard paul feig fare as its a subversion of an original ip full of adlib gags  i thought the actresses did well in their given positions but the writing was absolute garbage and the adlibbing was mostly distracting
Nov 13 2021,negative,it was fun to see but the jokes werent all that funny and there was just too many jokes
Nov 12 2021,negative,i went in this movie hoping to watch a good film but unfortunately this movie is hot garbage i was so disappointed with this movie and the fact that rotten tomatoes give this movie is 74 is beyond me and do not give me wrong i love the cast of snl but i dont think they realize what ghostbusters was and it looks like everyone was just phoning it in not caring about the material for what ghostbusters represents especially in the writing of the god awful jokes it was getting so bad for me that i am starting to hate watch it and when i do that that means im not having a good time
Nov 10 2021,negative,not a big fan of this version of the franchise hopefully it gets better with the newer version
Nov 8 2021,negative,a failure on all fronts what couldve worked and smashed the box office did the exact opposite only making this film memorable for its bad while the comedy may land with some it often doesnt succeed the slapstick is what arises the most laughs rather than the actual dialogue unlike the previous installments with a cast that has an immense amount of chemistry and previous all working on comedy show snl much is left to be desired its an unfunny rehash of the original its attempts at originality fail and more or less fall back into the overall plot of the 1984 film fennett
Nov 8 2021,negative,lowest of expectations and yet disappointing perfect example  to prove just starpower alone wont save a boring  irrelevant piece of a movie even if it includes my favorite    chris hemsworth
Nov 8 2021,negative,while void of the wit and chemistry of the original it is far from the destroyer of childhoods that the fanboys would have you believe that it is the film while proficient in technical terms squanders the talent it has on a mediocre story and an ever frustrating string of give and take jokes where in for every funny joke they cancel it out with two or more stinkers    all in all this film doesnt ruin your life or lessen the impact of the original but overall doesnt carry much in terms of quality on its own
Nov 8 2021,positive,this movie doesnt get enough love this was so respectful of the original so many great easter eggs and it was just a load of fun
Nov 6 2021,negative,a film that want to stand alone but constantly reminds you of previous gb films its so confused and slapstick
Nov 5 2021,negative,films that the critics love but the audience hate makes me think there is something wrong with the critics the movies werent made for criticsright    i believe that the director and actors really killed this movie for most people that love the franchise just be a movie its about ghost bustersthe more time that a production spends talking about things that arent ghost busters the greater the chance the audience can be turned off i have disdain for the disrespect to the original by erasing it with this story ghostbusters is a timeless gem and deserves better than to be cast aside just for a gender swap finally heres a questionis it more misogynistic to do a gender swap for the sake of a gender swap or develop new content with female characters in mind hmmm
Nov 3 2021,negative,i wanted to see this movie with an open mind and not take on the negative comments made about it but geez the first scene was good but then it starts to go down hill pretty rapidly from there chris hemsworth plays one of those roles that destroys peoples careers luckily most people had slipped into a coma by then in an attempt to survive till the end of the movie even the cameos couldnt save it  would not willingly watch again
Nov 1 2021,negative,worst part its shameful to think this is actually produced and made to be part of the ghostbusters franchise shame on sony for ruining stepping on and trying to erase the magical beloved classic original   dont watch promote or buy this disgrace  watch the original you will thank yourself
Oct 31 2021,positive,it really did the original movie justice with just the right amount of homage and new stuff i enjoyed it quite a bit  i dont know why i waited so long to watch it
Oct 31 2021,negative,the jokes are just reboots of the original movies jokes but the writers missed what was humorous about them  four talented female actresses do bad impersonations of the original characters while at times lampooning stereotypes of men then lampooning stereotypes of women  had they done a continuation had they done a movie that showed four women running a ghostbusting company with some originality this could have worked  instead it just came across as lacking the spirit of the original although slimer is in it so i guess they did have the spirit of the original
Oct 31 2021,neutral,watched this in the theater back in 2016 fun but i wish it was a sequel instead of a remake     i think the ladies are talented but what irks me is how there is this odd mix of ghostbusters media from now on some with the men and others with the ladies whom will at worst be regarded as the imposters and at best just the female alternated from the remake no one asked foralso that this movie was setup to disappoint to some degree from the very beginning    such a femalecharacterswap is seen as an effort to just spark some social conversationprior to the movies premiere it i suppose it was an effective way to reveal how many fans or whomever came out the woodwork couldnt decide what bothered them more forced feminism or sacrilege of the original    i think the movie would have been very interesting if the ladies were an entirely different team set in the ghostbusters universe or were new recruits    all they had to do was do nearly the exact same movie just give them different names and also rewrite some dialogue since the movie still managed to be quite different anyway    no one could be harold ramis dan akroyd ernie hudson or bill murray and well perhaps having women was actually a better move than having men try to act like the original guys but still then i wish they just wrote a new story    at least they arent witches i guess btw i suppose i would like to see hocus pocus starring menlol anyway    anyway thats all and also i agreed with soraya nadia mcdonalds review which says it missed much of its potential including interesting thoughts on leslie jones character and i suggest you read her review
Oct 29 2021,negative,pretty unimaginative reboot which doesnt really add anything new or original  the attempt to flip the gender roles was admirable if a little clumsy  would have been a lot better if it showed men  women ghost busting side by side without gender being an issue  instead this  has a guy playing the role of an eye candy bimbo receptionist with the ghostbusters gals sharing locker room jokes about how nice his ass is etc  pretty crass stuff and does nothing to break gender stereotypes
Oct 28 2021,negative,its just bad 1 why make it without any connection to the original movies they had the old actors but used them in different roles wtf   2 the comedy it tries really hard to be funny all the time but i only made a hmhm sound 23 times also none of the originals charm  3 all female reboot im not against it but why who the heck asked for this nobody appearently
Oct 24 2021,positive,this movie is really fun it actually has some good scares and it stands on its own even while it delivers the nostalgia we all crave excellent movie fabulous cameos  i wish theyd do a second
Oct 18 2021,positive,i thought this was a lot of fun i loved the actors and the script has some great lines and delivery  especially leslie the ghost would be the third scariest thing on that train and kate safety is for dudes
Oct 17 2021,positive,this is a great take on the original awesome humor from an awesome cast love the cameos from the original cast members as well
Oct 16 2021,negative,pretty amazingly bad first cited as a continuation of the 1984 movie instead being a feminist reboot 4 women leads is great but the acting and writing was not
Oct 16 2021,positive,great cast decent jokes but it tries to flip to action adventure in the second half and doesnt quite land it  i would have preferred to stay smaller scale and maybe have one big payoff as in the original rather than try to pivot to gigantic action sequences with comedy shoehorned in
Oct 16 2021,negative,great actresses horrible writing and execution could have been better if made this alternate universe like extreme ghostbusters
Oct 16 2021,negative,terrible movie with only a couple of funny bits even my wife didnt think it was funny
Oct 15 2021,negative,the jokes werent funny the funniest ones were worth a chuckle or an eye roll they tried to copy the character dynamics of the original but didnt have the skill writing or comedians to make it work they relied too heavily on special effects so its a pretty movie but boring   also its rated pg13 because of the crude jokes i was happy to bring my 9yearold to see the original since i saw it when i was a kid 14 if for some reason anyone actually liked this movie enough to bring their kid they would have to wait until theyre comfortable with that kind of humor definitely not a family movie like the original which goes to show you that you can have genuinely funny humor in a movie and not try to rely on questionable material dont think im a prude i own 2 eddie murphy standup movies ghostbuster 2016 just isnt funny i blame the writers for most of it because i actually like melissa mccarthy and kate mckinnon they just werent funny in this movie i would skip this movie its completely unnecessary especially since the new movie is a sequel to the originals and not the terrible remake you miss nothing by not watching it
Oct 15 2021,negative,in the whole 2 hours i was amused by one joke  its just sad and pitiful
Oct 14 2021,negative,it was badly written very unfunny using sexism as a crutch to prop up this disastrous movie if it was a tight script with crafted comedy lines then fair enough but it is a sloppy script where nearly every scene is full of overly long improvised unfunny garbagetier dialogue   if this film did star a male cast yet retained the script and improv it would have been rightly panned by every critic and movie goer on the planet but using its if you dont like this movie then you hate women cloak of invulnerability   to hide its inadequacy is frankly pathetic
Oct 13 2021,negative,they tried but ultimately i was bored not funny
Oct 12 2021,negative,just absolute garbage from start to finish how do you have so many comedians in one movie and absolutely no good comedy already deciding to never watch a movie with any of these actresses again just no talent at all
Oct 12 2021,negative,ghostbusters 1984 is one of my alltime favorite movies i would rather have ghostbusters exist in any format or any style this movie included now to review this film on its own merits i didnt hate nor love this movie ive never been a big fan of melissa mccarthys style of comedy spy is awesome i think of her comedic sensibilities are comparable to will ferrell which im not a huge fan of his comedies either that style of comedy just didnt work very well for me in this movie i know that im judging this film on it on merits but it didnt really seem to take the subject matter and its people as serious as the original it taking the seriousness of your subject matter could really elevate the comedy elements to hysterical proportions just felt that they spend a lot of time trying to build up to these comedic side pieces that just absolutely fell flat and lifeless my last and biggest gripe with the film the betrayal of the characters almost everyone in this movie is a stereotype do you have everyone dialed up to 1000 in their characters do you have characters acting like a straight buffoon and other characters are what hollywood thinks scientists are much like what the producers of the big bang theory think geek culture is like     there were some redeeming qualities that this film the two actors that stick out in a positive way if you call it that are kate mckinnon and chris hemsworth they are the bright spot because their characters are so extreme that it breaks the established stereotypes and it just becomes down right ridiculously comical the updated vfxs looked great this allowed the ghostbusters more freedom in their actions personally the ghosts looked strikingly beautiful yes they have more of a whimsical look but when you are primarily a comedy first that is not such a bad thing the action set pieces in the final act were actually pretty entertaining to watch as well overall this movie was a generic lifeless and somewhat entertaining ride if this movies on in the background i would be ok with it i also wouldnt be surprised if i would fast forward it to the last act
Oct 11 2021,negative,hollywood is all about shameless cash grabs but they could at least be good like a little bit
Oct 2 2021,negative,i hate melissa mccarthy
Oct 1 2021,positive,this ghostbusters is an excellent movie the femaleled retelling not only lives up to its source material it surpasses it five stars all the way
Sep 27 2021,negative,i just came across this film while channel surfing my god what were they thinking  no words none
Sep 27 2021,positive,formulaic  overdone comedy from paul feig and i very much enjoyed some of his others i did get into it a little in the final act i love the cast but it was a frustrating ghostbusters experience theres a lot of hate for this movie and theres also a lot of hate for hating this moving i cant speak for others but part of my disappointment with this one existing was that i had been waiting for another ghostbusters movie for a long time the franchise lost a lot of steam over the years and if this one didnt go well i feared we wouldnt get to see more i look forward to the new one coming out with paul rudd and the younger cast it looks to want to exist in the same world as the originals not sure about the comedy but the adventure tone seems fun
Sep 24 2021,negative,the jokes fell flat  i expected sooo much more from pretty much everyone in this movie unfortunately the writingdirecting let us all down and this will be a horrible mark on everyone involved
Sep 24 2021,negative,this movie garbanzo
Sep 23 2021,positive,not as good as the first ghostbusters but in the immortal word of the farmer to the pig babe that will do pig that will do
Sep 18 2021,positive,this is a really good and funny ghostbusters girl remake film it does have violent and profane parts though its still a spectacular ghostbusters girl remake film 55  1010 in my opinion
Sep 16 2021,positive,i liked this one even more on second viewing  it combines the fun of the originals adds in new fresh jokes and storyline and gathers four hilarious women to be a kickass team of ghost fighting scientists plus patty  all four actresses were perfect for their roles  i was one of those who was super excited to hear about an all women reboot and this didnt disappoint  plus you get cameos from pretty much all the cast of the originals and lots of small details to honor the movies
Sep 14 2021,positive,sometimes we let ourselves be blinded by classicists from our childhood most of the negative criticism ive seen alongside uh feminism could also be applied to the old films the new film is not more childish sillier or stereotypical than like the old film series on the contrary the new film alludes to the old films and even gives bill murray a longer guest role without a major problem of the old filmsit did not become a bill murray show the new ghostbusters had more depth and screen time than in the old filmsi encourage everyone to watch the first old film again and to try to compare objectively with the new film who then does not notice that the new film fits perfectly into the film seriess and even gives to it a lot can just be influenced too much by the fact that the protagonists are women
Sep 12 2021,positive,not sure of all the bad hype for this  its a fun romp with the same campy special effects and humor that gave the original two its fame  i still watch it from time to timemaybe not as much as the first two but stillit has its qualities to stand on its own  technically i dont think it should have been known as a revampit should have been a sequel with a new team  bill murray dan aykroyde and annie potts still make some great and humorous appearances but not as their former selves  again i liked this not loved and i was kind of hoping for another one with these female actors  i actually thought they were great and added some great charm to the movie  again i would have changed it to the older ghostbusters training them but it is what it is
Sep 4 2021,negative,uninspiring full of bad jokes sometimes its funny but often its something only high schoolers would do and say
Sep 3 2021,negative,while it has spectacle in its visuals ghostbusters 2016 is a soulless revival that focuses more on comedy than actually busting some ghosts
Sep 3 2021,positive,even if it has some issues ghostbusters 2016 is a very fun film i loved the slimer cameo even if he was just cg he still looked cool the action is just fun ghostbusters action all though my biggest criticism is 100 how they use so much cg the ghosts were kinda lookin like the ghosts from eddie murphys haunted mansion but overall this is still a very fun film710
Aug 31 2021,negative,needs negative stars how can you mess up ghostbusters  hell if you took the exact same script and redid it with sock puppets i would rate that higher
Aug 27 2021,negative,sooo many bad jokes some of the ghostbusters were just annoying and none of them knew what they were doing
Aug 22 2021,positive,somehow id think his ghostbusters reboot was pretty nice and id think i want to write a spoof comedy of it as a real treat after i feel sorry for mr paul feig himself
Aug 18 2021,positive,literally the best comedy movie of all time this movie took all the anger i felt as a child watching movies with terribly written flat female characters and turned it into gold i always imagined trying to make gender swapped versions of movies pre2016 but it always came from a place of anger this film transcends really funny in a way that movies just werent allowed to be it is truly the first real comedy movie and a turning point for the art form itself when watching things pre2016 i often find myself saying it is okay but just so preghostbusters cult classic must see
Aug 10 2021,negative,horrible pointless story the reboot was not needed but a continuation would be meaningful the main characters are onedimensional without any depth the villain is poor went to the cinema with an open mind exited with a knot in my stomach
Aug 9 2021,negative,i was a real fan of the classic one this didnt do it justice
Aug 8 2021,negative,i usually recommend family movies to others by how much fun my kids had watching it  they love the original hated the second part but this one was the first movie my kids asked me unanimously to turn off after about half of its runtime and go to the next on our list  i was kind of relieved i found the updated humor to be somewhat cringy
Aug 5 2021,negative,i was told this was a comedy
Aug 1 2021,negative,i want my money back
Jul 31 2021,negative,watched it for the first time yesterday just horrible and unfunny
Jul 29 2021,negative,the humor was very lacking and lacked the delivery and character of the first film trying to capture such a strange and beautiful film like ghost busters with a cheap knock off with worse writing and worse acting just cant make the cut
Jul 28 2021,negative,politics aside the movie is just terrible the jokes fall flat the acting is dreadful the story is poor
Jul 28 2021,negative,this movie is what happens when none of the actors have talent and the people behind the scenes have no idea what they are doing this film embodies everything wrong with the film industry
Jul 28 2021,negative,no chemistry between the actors and the jokes are not funny
Jul 27 2021,negative,terrible and really bad boring unfunny movie
Jul 27 2021,negative,talented actors some funny moments but just failed to bring it home why ignore the originals could have just been a continuation ill never understand
Jul 27 2021,negative,some good bits but the rest is in general awful
Jul 27 2021,negative,utterly unwatchable    lets see what director and screewriter paul feig has to say about this fiasko   2016 was an ugly year he believes the films release was intertwined with hillary clinton and the antihillary movement it was the year where i dont know just everyone went to a boiling point i dont know if it was having an african american president for eight years teed them up or something but they were ready to explode like its crazy how people got nuts about women trying to be in power or be in positions that they werent normally in    nailed it
Jul 26 2021,negative,this is no my beautiful franchise
Jul 26 2021,negative,instead of creating a movie with the original cast they remade it and attacked the fans for not liking it
Jul 25 2021,positive,if youre looking for a revisit of the ghostbusters franchise then this isnt the movie for you and to be honest this disappointed me too  if you cant get past that part then youre going to experience a major problem  the movie is heavily referential to the original ghostbusters movies whether it be characters locations or plot points and these will certainly feel like a direct attack on your loving memories of the franchise  i cant help shake the feeling that if the movie hadnt leaned on references so heavily and focused on being movie set in the ghostbusters universe movie rather than a reboot of a franchise it would have been received in a much more positive way by the fans    that being said theres also good things here   the cast and crew obviously care about the movie so noones phoning anything in  that provides just enough charm to allow you to overlook disjointed inclusions or the occasional overthetop performance that doesnt quite fit  the cast is funny when the script allows them to be and the bright and colorful ghosts provide a relatively cheerful movie for a ghost story     its not going to blow anyones socks off and its got some obvious issues but its an entertaining if somewhat forgettable popcorn flick in its own right     and you know what  if youre willing to let this movie just be what it is then its enough  grab some snacks dont overthink anything and have a laugh
Jul 17 2021,negative,bill murray was right these are some funny ladies they are the funniest women probably in the history of comedy these are the types of women who would have made george carlin want to get a sex change operation in the hopes that having a vagina would up his game     and the director is one welldressed gentleman hes probably one of the best dressed directors working in hollywood today i dont know why he didnt win an academy award for his attire or at least a golden globe    the script was also a finelytuned and polished piece of art you can tell a lot of time and thought went into crafting such a brilliant bundle of pages which were made up of many words and sentences which were then cordoned off into paragraphs     muah makes kissing motion to my fingertips as i throw my hand into the air
Jul 17 2021,negative,a slap to the face of the great old movies  aggressiv unfunny and pretentious
Jul 17 2021,positive,i give 3 for effort you have 2  of my favorite comicscrush on wig but stop it with reboots   full women cast didnt work for oceans 11 why here how about all black next asian leave cult classics alone  funny and great if you never ever watched or knew about who bill murray is  enjoy the moist humid towel you dry your hands on which is this remake
Jul 16 2021,negative,i dont get the boy girl fight its just a bad movie its a ghostbuster movie with slimer and the symbol and reminds me of a good movie so it gets a bonus point
Jul 15 2021,positive,my kids and i loved it wished there were more coming but i guess we are out of luck
Jul 13 2021,negative,this was painful to watch the cast of mccarthy wiig jones and mckinnon are normally not funny to begin with but the attempts at physical comedy are just sad to watch
Jul 10 2021,negative,certified garbage tried to reboot a movie that did not need rebooting completely unfunny forced and uninteresting
Jul 9 2021,negative,no keep the original
Jul 4 2021,negative,hey i managed to finish watching it and given how bad it is thats a small accomplishment
Jul 3 2021,negative,the original ghost busters is quite frankly unforgettable its done for comedy what star wars did for scifi combining different genres perfectly and has influenced generations of media creatives this new version brings little to the table forced humour which falls flat pointless cameos a reliance on industry standard fx and forgettable score just feels like a movie made to keep the copyright and sell merchandise i have no compunction to rewatch and it will act only as an annoying obstruction to the 1984 because you search for ghostbusters on streaming and you wont want this one
Jun 29 2021,negative,how did this get a 49 from audiences
Jun 24 2021,negative,the cast isnt the issue with this film frankly if they made this cast allmale it would do equally bad in my opinion the script is full of unnecessary jokes that are also repetitive as well as having a story that makes a joke out of the ghostbuster franchise with multiple plotholes and odd choices with cinematic shots its a shame to see a reboot full female cast act so ridiculous in an attempt to make it unique for a modern movie give me a week and i could rewrite this script far better in all honesty
Jun 9 2021,positive,1 word fantastic the criticism for this movie is unbelievable if you are a fan of the originals you must see this one it had me laughing throughout the 2 hours
Jun 3 2021,negative,another failed reboot that managed to be unfunny and boring a bad unfunny cast playing characters no one cares about in a movie trying to feminize a franchise from decades ago so a little extra money could be made
Jun 1 2021,positive,funny original  romantic
May 31 2021,positive,amongst hoards of angry ghostbuster fans i really like this movie granted im a huge fan of the original who watched this version when i was 14 but to me its a good movie not worthy of any insane critical acclaim but the movie is visually pleasing and has a lot of good silly laughs with a side of the paranormal if youre overprotective over your ghostbuster nostalgia stay clear but if you are open to new experiences this movie wont disappoint its loads of fun to watch with hilarious moments and some cool music and effects
May 25 2021,negative,one word garbagefire
May 20 2021,negative,ghostbusters is a reboot that has no respect for the classic whatsoever its gags are obvious drag on for too long and are generally unfunny barring one the characters are very unlikeable boring and obnoxious and the awful acting by the cast further worsens this problem the plot is thin dumb and badly written overall ghostbusters is a film that should have never been made  definitely not worth your time
May 19 2021,negative,they screwed another famous franchise 
May 19 2021,negative,point of order before i get into this review i would be not be doing this review justice without briefly giving you a rundown of my status as a ghostbusters super fan i had the first movie memorized completely at the age of 5 ive seen every episode of both ghostbusters tv shows at least twice and i built a 98 screen accurate proton pack prop complete with both lights and sound so yes im a super fan and yes ive been one of those internet guys who have not been a fan of the production and promotion leading up to the release of this film thats also why i have waited so long to see the movie and even longer to write the review i didnt want my displeasure with the production to unfairly color my view now that i feel i am fully composed this is my review for ghostbusters 2016    this new version of everyones favorite paranormal eliminators is actually a remake that takes place in a universe where nobody knows who to call when theres something strange in the neighborhood the movie has bridesmaids stars melissa mccarthy and kristen wiig reuniting along with other snl alumni in kate mckinnon and leslie jones as four ladies who have taken up the mantle as the chief specter inspectors in the city of new york as they investigate a growing number of unusually high powered spooks running amok in the big apple    sighi could have written and cast a better film with the 4 hours and 57 minutes i have left in this day that would be better than the horsecrap i saw on the screen this afternoon part of what made the original ghostbusters great was that it was a comedy but it looked like a serious drama or supernatural thriller its shot with wide angle lenses it had a meticulously written script by dan aykroyd and harold ramis two of the best writers for snl and sctv at the time and it always knew just how far to go with its improv    the problem with this version of ghostbusters is that nobody wrote it what i mean by that is that nobody writes comedies in general anymore its very clear that they just had a general rough draft grade idea of what they wanted to do with this movie and then they just get a bunch of improv actors together to shoot ten versions of one scene and pick the best one director paul feig has made a career out of doing just this that style of making everything up as you go along is ok for something like the heat or bridesmaids something that nobody has any expectations for if feig had decided to make another of his original comedies i wouldnt have had a problem with him saddling up melissa mccarthy and riding her to the finish line but for the love of pete venkman you cannot do that with a movie like ghostbusters you cant fuel the remake of the number one movie of 1984 the number one year of movies ever on pure yes and power there were scenes that went nowhere there was no cohesive theme the editing was shoddy the characters lacked any kind of depth or arch and it was shot like an abc familyscoobydoo film ive seen ghostbusters fan films that were more inspired than this movie and i can say that without any reservation dont even get me started on the dumb and dumber to grade disaster that chris hemsworths character was in short nobody could be that stupid and function even in suspended reality its not all bad though kate mckinnons character was very quirky and charming and there were some pretty good cameos and easter eggs here but even they ended up leaving a sour taste in my mouth its kinda like dropping pieces of candy into a bowl of vomit the more you see it the more you are just disappointed that all the good stuff is getting ruined by everything around it this is completely unacceptable for a 140 million dollar sony movie    before i close i have to address one more thing that really chaps my back and thighs which is the fact that the people responsible for making this movie accused misogynists and internet trolls of being against this movie because it starred four women they did this while at the same time they knew for a fact that they started their movie with crude toilet humor and ended it with a massive testicle punch joke how dare you how dare you ghostbusters gets a 1 out of 5
May 17 2021,negative,this movie is terrible i dont even remember the og and i didnt care about the controversy with the die hard fans but this 2016 version is just stupid and forgettable you want to watch a good scifi female cast movie please watch anihilation
May 13 2021,negative,arguably one of the worst remakes ever made
May 12 2021,negative,its not good best things about it are leslie jones when not screaming and some scenes very few are a bit scary or uneasy except for that unbelievable characters actors improvise too much which makes a disconnect between characters from the plot and characters when they say jokes most jokes are simply unfunny thor is obnoxiously stupid to the point you feel sorry for him helmholtz is a personification of one character trait being wacky bottom line dont waste your time watching it
May 10 2021,negative,awful probably a good watch if you like bridesmaids but its nothing like the oringal its a trash and i have no idea how it was made
May 10 2021,negative,went to see it first run in the theater     by the time the movie was halfway through most of the audience had left   the entire front two rows left at the same time     worst movie id ever paid for
May 7 2021,negative,i think it was horrible excuse for a remake can we please do something more original than just changing the genders poorly written poorly performed i dont know how you can get such unfunny results from some of the most funny people in the world
May 1 2021,negative,really bad jokes and did not flow well at all the movie also keeps reminding you that there is a better ghostbusters movie out there just watch the original 1984 version and skip this one
Apr 29 2021,negative,it feels as if someone who only watched and hated the trailer of the original movies wanted to make a scathing parody remake but failed miserably that or the director had no idea why the originals were so beloved terrible humor awkward casting and poor acting and complete underutilization of more modern movie making techniques felt corporate as hell
Apr 27 2021,negative,feel long winded and drawn out for no reason the humor is forced and the acting is painful the director should be taken out the back and shot i genuinely feel sorry for chris hemsworth but i guess every actor needs a flop in his career to be embarrassed about save your time and sanity and skip this one
Apr 24 2021,negative,critics are right about this movie being a steamy pile of turds its hard to watch the whole thing i prefer the original
Apr 22 2021,negative,acting was bismol at best  should have casted a different group of actors
Apr 21 2021,negative,well there was literally nothing else to watch so i watched this film sadly i was far from impressed the half isfor the ghost graphics and thats about the best bit of the film it just seems to be a movie of who can make the most annoying aaaahhhhhhhhh noise  its cheesy but really badly cheesy chris hemsworth must of been trying to do a tim curry only reason his films got a star was because of tim curry the humour is flat childish and old tat the plot is pointless the writing is poor the direction is meh and the acting is pathetic this film belongs with the et game on atari buried in a desert to be forgotten
Apr 17 2021,negative,by far the most stupid and inconsistent movie ive seen recently breaks the laws of its own universe and the plot is far beyond dumb nothing makes sense here terrible
Apr 11 2021,negative,i think i laughed like once also having the only black character being the only non scientist was racist no matter how much leslie jones says otherwise
Apr 10 2021,negative,abomination too much propaganda and portraying things too illogically thats now how the real world works take that femi sht up yo backside
Apr 5 2021,positive,one of my favorite movies of all time the awkward tension of erin the sassiness of patty the spontaneity and hilarity of holtzmann and the boldness of abby makes the team the full package the movie starts out with a fake haunt tour and then quickly turns into a real haunting the movie had my rapt attention as i was sitting in my seat waiting for the next scene its sweet hilarious and motivating the cameos of the original ghostbusters was a wonderful delight     the characters could have their own movies and would be fascinating especially jillian the way that they all get along and establish a beautiful sense of camaraderie that simply cant be beat other than the ogs the awkward way they all come together is a nice change of pace    would recommend to people who are socially awkward a ghostbuster fan a comedy fan or someone who just wants an awkwardly funny movie to make you feel good its a good time with fun lines
Apr 1 2021,negative,it is so bad that i could not even finish it
Mar 28 2021,neutral,no  it was horrible it was trying too hard to be woke instead of feeding the original story line i cant wait to see the next release with the story line tied into it allot better
Mar 24 2021,positive,awesome i love the cast good movie
Mar 22 2021,negative,five years after the manufactured controversy died down i finally bit the bullet and gave ghostbusters 2016 a try  its genuinely terrible  a talented cast falls flat on its face thanks to a director who apparently told them all to behave like goofy hyperactive weirdos  cringeinducing scenes of awkward improv go on for way too long  the grossout gags and potty humor would be immature in preschool  the supernatural elements are idiotic and banal  this movie felt like an excruciating two hours of watching a standup act flop  there wasnt a single genuine laugh to be found in this whole dumb loud annoying disaster
Mar 11 2021,neutral,meh its not nearly as terrible as 2016 internet fanboys would like you to believe but it certainly isnt that good of a movie either the action scenes are decent but nothing particularly spectacular the humor is pretty split down the middle some of it works and other times it misses and goes on for way too long the actresses are all clearly talented but theyre let down by the lackluster direction and an overreliance on awkward addlibbing but its certainly a competent movie and isnt that bad of a watch it certainly isnt the feminazi agenda endgame like so many online misogynists claimed it was back in 2016 but i still wouldnt exactly call it a comedic masterpiece or even a feminist masterpiece either forgettable but forgivable
Mar 7 2021,negative,i wish i could get a refund for going to see this  nothing in this movie worked  not funny at all
Mar 1 2021,negative,this was a totally forgettable film there was no need for a remake and an all female cast feels more like pandering than inclusiveness
Feb 28 2021,negative,total trash which is a shame because i actually like kristen wiig quite a lot    this movie sucked so much with all its ridiculous controversy that i actually wanted to just simply right no but one word is apparently insufficient as a review despite the fact it was all that needed to be said
Feb 26 2021,positive,the 2016 film was a lot more comedically pleasing to me than the original the jokes were understandable and relatable
Feb 21 2021,negative,i got this movie for free i think i over paid
Feb 3 2021,positive,this is one very good looking movie i love the cgi effects combined with the amazing 3d effects to look like its popping out of the tele also chris hemsworth is the best part of this film being charming and funny whenever hes on screen im not a massive fan of female ghostbusters though
Dec 30 2020,negative,absolutely horrible acting was bad and the plot was boring i want my time back i spent watching this bore fest
Dec 29 2020,negative,if youre a fan of the original  its ok to avoid this one there is a different between smart subtle comedy  and fishing and setting up forced comedy
Dec 29 2020,negative,wtf most of the jokes werent funny waste of time the only reason i have it is because it was given to me digitally for free i want to find a way to delete it from digital collection because it is so bad i am ashamed to have it in collection
Dec 28 2020,negative,just another attempt to remake a movie with a modern take that butchered the original
Dec 27 2020,negative,thank god this movie has been scrubbed from ghostbusters lol now just a bad memory leslie jones is terrible thank god this movie is not cannon
Dec 16 2020,negative,very well might be the worst movie i have ever seen  there are no redeeming features 0100
Nov 29 2020,neutral,it was fine just impossible to live up to the originals but if youre in the market for a few chuckles and have nothing else to watchthe try it
Nov 14 2020,neutral,its fun ok but not as awesome as the original am for woman but this one aint doing it
Nov 8 2020,negative,the idea is great an all female ghostbuster is a good idea if they did the tone consistent the humor was awful the story is nonsense and the characters are just annoying and why in the world is the ghostbusters not doing science literally there first thought is crossing the streams to do a total protonic reversal than thinking a another plan just awful sony can do better than this
Nov 2 2020,positive,loved this movie this isnt a straight up remake its its own movie the original is referenced in well done cameos the cast has great chemistry the actings great i ts a gals movie only to the extent that the original was a guys movie highly recommend to all
Oct 26 2020,positive,for some reason i liked this movie a lot more when i first saw it in theaters a few years ago rewatching now the flaws really started to show its overly reliant on special effects and action sequences which get old very quickly for this reason the first half of the film is really enjoyable  the characters are quirky and funny and the writing shines in the low stakes situations by the end of the film it has devolved into a lightshow with poorlywritten oneliners     all of that being said the cast is wonderful and its a lot of fun to see chris hemsworth show off his humorous chops i love how it flips gender stereotypes on their head even if the same cant be said for racial stereotypes the cameos from the original ghostbusters are also pretty entertaining this reboot is worth watching but just barely
Oct 25 2020,positive,love this movie the cast the plot the comedy  really wish we could have a sequel my son and daughters would absolutely love it they love these ghostbusters
Oct 19 2020,positive,lots of laughs i really enjoyed it
Oct 19 2020,neutral,first things first the following is worth noting i have no attachment to the 1984 film nor do i particularly like it i rated it and its sequel 2 im not saying its overrated or anything i just personally dont enjoy it thats all    with that said id class 2016s ghostbusters better than the original however as you tell by my rating thats not me saying this is a good film i dont believe it is its incredibly slow paced with a very forgettable and untidy plot it felt longer than a 116 minute run time thats for sure    its not all bad though i actually rate the casting melissa mccarthy can be hitandmiss but this is one of her more solid performances kristen wiig great in bridesmaids alongside mccarthy is a decent performer too leslie jones and kate mckinnon are alright while chris hemsworth is pretty amusing    i despite not being a fan of it still enjoyed the callbacks to the 84 film as well as the use of the superb theme song as for the special effects they look good but none of the ghosts stick in my memory both visually but also in terms of the story it wouldve been nice to have a standout ghost likewise with the films villain who is ridiculously plain    in conclusion it does positive things but there are certainly negatives all in all i think the latter just outweighs the former unfortunately 2½
Oct 15 2020,positive,funny fempowered and doesnt take itself too seriously
Oct 15 2020,negative,this movie just sucks no other way to put it this movie had real talent behind it too but the scrip was just horrid they tried to make a shot for shot remake of the first ghostbusters but with non of the humor the characters have no depth the first joke in the movie is a quweef joke none of the characters mesh like the first movies did i feel like if they would have just continued the original movies and didnt try to completely rewrite the ghostbusters this movie could have stood a chance
Oct 12 2020,positive,this film is better  this film is incredible
Oct 6 2020,positive,the marketing did this movie no service besides making it seem bad but this movie is great it was funny and action packed which was what it was trying to be
Oct 6 2020,negative,it was cgi soup not really funny and when there was an ok joke it was dragged out to the point where it was painful     glad gb3 is ignoring 2016 fiasco
Sep 29 2020,neutral,i dont have a huge connection with the original so i came into this one without the nostalgia lens still though i can see what others didnt enjoy it the cast is fantastic but the script is pretty awful the comedy doesnt hit and the jokes often took me out of the movie the plot itself is decent and i think the pacing is pretty good and consistent the effects are also one of the better parts of the film especially during the last act overall its fine i wouldnt give it a second watch willingly but its not a horrible reboot
Sep 1 2020,positive,the first half was so good really funny reunion of the women of snl but then it got all cgi cartoony 
Aug 31 2020,positive,this funny movie made me feel like i like ghostbusters again
Aug 30 2020,neutral,what did i think of ghostbusters check out my full review below  
Aug 27 2020,negative,it was unfunny lazily written and pales in comparison to the original this movie could have been good but they got the worst writers possible
Aug 26 2020,positive,an incredible funny cast and pretty good jokes
Aug 24 2020,negative,horribly unfunny tasteless dumb forced pathetic and desperate  do not feel guilty for not liking this film
Aug 23 2020,negative,this movie was a cashgrab reboot
Aug 21 2020,negative,absolute garbage  an insult to the originals
Aug 19 2020,negative,corny forced humour was really boring also and maybe aimed at people whose sense of humour hasnt developed from when they were 14 sick of crappy remakes like this
Aug 19 2020,negative,just poor almost an unfunny parody of the original but using women script and acting are just awful the characters are one dimensional and act like 10yearolds the humour is just childish and lewd bad longwinded unfunny jokes no onscreen chemistry between the character the actors looked to be improvising their lines and jokes but not doing it well bill murrays cameo was the best part this is not the worst film ive ever seen but its definitely in the top ten
Aug 15 2020,positive,i honestly dont understand the hate that this film got i loved this from the start the stars have a chemistry that makes the whole story its funny and has a few nods from the original
Aug 11 2020,negative,shocking nothing to do with the female cast they were actually a plus it was badly written nonexistent jokes a really badly beat for beat remake  steer clear of this disaster
Aug 11 2020,negative,for this movie to get a similar review as avengers age of ultron is disgraceful and discrediting to rotten tomatoes  ghostbusters had a charm and realism to it but this reboot has no charm or worthwhile plot development  as much as i love kristen wiig and kate mckinnon the script just forced qips and the characters never show any chemistry  mckinnons character is forced to make up explanations for fictional science toys and it was eye rolling to say the least  the fact everything looked like a toy didnt help with the movie  the special effects were blockbuster quality but compared with the realistic approach the 1984 classic took they looked silly in comparison  with a plot that was rambling and forgetful it is a wonder why this reboot was attempted  at least jason reitman will correct this trainwreck with proper refresh that will let us forget this abomination was ever created
Aug 11 2020,negative,it is not better than the original but it has very good special effects
Aug 6 2020,negative,garbage  when a movie was done perfectly the first time why would you redo ithorribly no less  stop it
Jul 15 2020,negative,complete garbage more work put into the reason they remade vs an actually good film  a regurgitation
Jul 13 2020,negative,the thought of a ghostbusters remake really didnt feel right as the original movie ist just too good   but when the first news with an all female cast got public i thought it acutally could worka more different kind of approach and not so much comparable to the original  unfortunately it simply didnt work out the movie was not funny at all everything that was good in the original was lostno witty humor too much blablaunbearable 
Jul 9 2020,positive,the other 26 that didnt like the movie is ezekiel from total drama
Jul 8 2020,negative,what a disaster they should have just made gb3
Jul 6 2020,positive,great comedians excellent to see a childhood favourite brought back to life by this very entertaining ensemble wish there could be a sequel with these ladies
Jun 27 2020,negative,it was the most humorless  dull plodding  movie i seen in a very long time
Jun 27 2020,neutral,again you have a great cast of funny female actresses but you can not expect a remake of a film to be good without the original actors sorry to say but no one can replace the classics
Jun 25 2020,negative,not funny and somewhat stupid
Jun 23 2020,negative,bullcrap i dont know why ramis had to go i wish there would have been another solution to this wasnt satisfying at all they should have came up with a sequel a lot of time earlier
Jun 21 2020,positive,i dont know what to think of this film is it necessarily bad and a lot of areas its hitandmiss but for the most part i can see it being a fun film now as a ghost busters film its feels like a downright insult and paul feig could have offered some directionand the writing staff could have at least wrote a script instead of pointing to the actors throwing them in the scene and saying you do funny stuff that being said i mostly put the blame for the badness of this movie on the director himself and the writer staff not knowing what the hell theyre doing the actors were okay they werent that bad nothing extremely crazy good like no bygone jen moments per se by okay nonetheless    i feel like this movie might fall into the category of it wasnt a ghostbusters film it might pass for an okayoriginal movie but as it being a ghostbusters film and cran it being the first one in some years that has come out this film was a downright insult to the heart of the fans hell cartoon series and comics have created better stories than what the writer and director did for this film i mean feel free to factcheck that theres the real ghostbusterstheres also the idw ghostbusters comics which probably has some good stuff in it ive never read them too much so i wouldnt know    i just feel like at least with this film they had an opportunity to really make something original really make something their own but the director paul feig just didnt do anything with it and he just didnt go anywhere extremely interesting or extremely chaotic or fantastic he literally had creative freedom and this is what he did with it this was the result    so that being said its not a extremely bad filmthere are probably even worse or bombs out there that you shouldnt touch with a tenfoot pole if you want to pass the time or something like that but its not something god tier amazing either there is definitely better stuff out there i will say for me personally i didnt mind it im not going to sit on it because it was semi fun but dont take my word for it as a critic in anyway because well i could just be an idiot but i did find some enjoyable moments in here personally        that being said sadly with a delay that happen which everybody knows whywe wont get to see ghostbusters afterlife for yet another year yeah im eagerly waiting to see what that brings to the table hopefully ghostbusters afterlife will be a hundred times better i got my fingers crossed and my prayers at my heart that if anything jason reitman is able to create something similar to the lines of guardians of the galaxy vol 2 something beautiful    but thats all ive basically got to say here i dont have much to say im not going to extremely s on this film because i have nothing against it sfm it was semi fun but if you want seriousness if you want some anime level of god tierness or matt youre not going to get it but he might get a laugh or two so who knows watch it if you please im not going to stop you
Jun 16 2020,positive,the extended version of ghostbusters is really quite good character development is better and the whole story makes more sense special effects are beautiful to watch favorite line room full of nightmares nope not going in there
Jun 15 2020,negative,thank god ghostbusters afterlife is coming out to pick up the pieces of the franchise that the 2016 movie destroyed this was horrible from beginning credits to ending credits acting was less than annoying     again bring on ghostbusters afterlife and lets never mention this 2016 version again ever
Jun 10 2020,negative,another poorly written cash grab that tries to cash in on the legacy of a classic cinema masterpiece by sloppily rehashing it unfunny unoriginal and insulting to the audiences intelligence   overall a pretty average modern hollywood film
Jun 10 2020,negative,was it the worst movie i saw  maybe not bt it definitely too 3 worst movies i ever wasted my life watching
Jun 7 2020,negative,very poor reboot humor is forced bad acting ew
Jun 4 2020,positive,excellent movie revitalising the franchise and showcasing some great female american comedic talent ive grown up loving ghostbusters and this was a great nod to the originals all the keyboard warriors living with their moms slating this because they have nothing better to do or are scared that women can do just as much if not more than us men can make me laugh pettyness that didnt and wont stop progressive movies like this looking forward to afterlife now when corona buggers off uk gb fan happy again
Jun 4 2020,negative,an insult to the original terrible script bad screen shots and shoddy acting all contributed to this score
Jun 3 2020,negative,theres nothing to say other than dont bother finding out for yourself one full star for not being the last jedi
Jun 3 2020,negative,waste of resources predictable yet disappointing to continue the disappointment the stale formularized characters had the same tired interactions weve come to expect from the big movie studios  if youve somehow missed the plethora of offerings from the ex snl cast you may be able to stomach this feature but i wouldnt bet my last on it
Jun 2 2020,positive,the only thing that saved this movie was the cameos from the original cast and the acting from chris hemsworth and kate mckinnon
Jun 2 2020,negative,a poor shell of the original ghost busters  not worth the money
Jun 2 2020,positive,yall are crazy paul feigs femalefronted ghostbusters is a hilarious romp through a familiar premise with just enough twists to make this fresh take a pleasure to watch    when strange occurrences read ghost sightings begin to pop up all over new york city this poor city just give it a break a group of unlikely heroes band together to form the ghostbusters kristen wiig melissa mccarthy kate mckinnon and leslie jones elevate what could have been disastrously boring material in the hands of the lesstalented their chemistry is captivating each playing to their strengths in the group and feeding off of one another mckinnon in particular leans into her delightfully kooky character with ridiculous moments that instantly put a smile on your face i would watch these women read the bible together add in chris hemsworth playing against type a character as dumb as dumb could be and you have a ghostbusters team i never knew i wanted    there are some faults however neil casey as the central villain being one of them his portrayal of a bullied hotel maintenance man trying to open the gates to another plane of existence was almost comical the stakes never quite seemed too high the animation also leaves a little to be desired with the ghosts are looking similar in their bluish hues indistinguishable from one another at times    the hate that this film gets is unwarranted its fun its wellacted and its a joy to sit through when the world is going to hell around us and you could just use a laugh sadly it seems that this film will just be ignored moving forward pushed aside to usher in ghostbusters afterlife in what many expect is a course correction in my opinion such an action is unneeded this cast killed it in the best possible way
Jun 1 2020,negative,pretty rough watch i hope they figure out what to do with this ip because this was a corporate paint by numbers heap
Jun 1 2020,negative,ruined thankfully the 1984 original still exists
Jun 1 2020,negative,pretty much unwatchable terrible acting terrible script plot holes and really childish jokes    id like to believe this was a parody but it was marketed as a serious movie
May 27 2020,positive,i think i might be the only person who absolutely loved this one what a hilarious movie and great cast
May 23 2020,positive,unlikable main casts dialogue script was kinda terrible lack of focus on character development the only good thing was the cameos of the true actors of the original ghostbusters overall a missed opportunity
May 18 2020,negative,the first few minutes had me thinking that maybe it wasnt going to be so bad the remaining minutes took those first few minutes stomped them into a lumpy paste buried them in peat and recycled them as firelighters
May 11 2020,negative,absolutely insulting to the original franchise
May 10 2020,negative,there are some laughs but the film ultimately is devoid of life and heart its made up of cameos unearned callbacks and the wasting of some great comedians
May 8 2020,negative,absolute garbage a disgrace to the franchise
May 6 2020,negative,not really worth the time
Apr 26 2020,positive,a strongly more feminist but funny and strongly lead update of a classic 80s flick for the internet era
Apr 25 2020,negative,the only reason to watch this is cause of chris hemsworth
Apr 25 2020,positive,good cast and it has potential but just seems to be lackluster and fall short as i think they tried too hard for jokes chris pines role didnt really seem to fit either i would have liked to see more from the original cast instead of short cameos
Apr 21 2020,negative,the worst remake i have ever seen
Apr 18 2020,negative,i would use this movie for interrogations ill do it ill press play
Apr 17 2020,negative,im not a fan of this movie but the hate this movie got was completely offtherails people acted as if this movie was sacrilegious or as if the world was going to end because of this movie who cares if the lead characters are women that doesnt define a movie that being said its just the exact same as the first movie without the imagination and ideas that movie
Apr 9 2020,negative,god awful absolutely abysmal
Apr 7 2020,negative,wheres the comedy who wrote this crap
Mar 28 2020,negative,this remake train wreck was a waste of film
Mar 26 2020,neutral,its effects were the best parts while story and characterwise the movie fell behind it doesnt compare very well to the originals and feels like a corporate attempt to get views by attracting longtime fans of ghostbusters and showing their attempt at inclusiveness by having an allfemale cast
Mar 25 2020,negative,an absolutely awful film not funny poor acting big letdown
Mar 24 2020,positive,i thought it was hilarious cameos by original actors lots of gender stereotypes flipped in a subtle yet funny way fun to watch
Mar 19 2020,positive,enjoyable light flick i havent watched the original for  at least 30 years but i feel like with this remake the setup was the most enjoyable part once there was a serious ghost infestation it lost comic momentum and as a viewer i lost interest the big bad ghosts seemed more fun in the original but then i was a kid  young teen at the time
Mar 16 2020,negative,when doing something just because you can or because youre trying to prove a point you should be prepared to deal with the repercussions of that  genderswapping a reboot isnt specifically why this movie is bad because i genuinely think you could have found some actually funny women and made at least a passable attempt even if it was by no means necessary  but this movie is full of subpar humor and a boring plot that was destined to get slammed by the audience  you will never ever recreate the recipe that made the original movie so good and its a bit insulting that they thought this mess was anything other than a mockery of the comedy geniuses behind the original
Mar 16 2020,negative,the writers really missed the charm of the original movie they repeated the jokes from original movie without understanding any of them
Mar 11 2020,positive,a good movie lots of cgi good film
Mar 5 2020,positive,hilarious my family loved it
Mar 1 2020,negative,so disrespectful to the original material
Feb 25 2020,negative,bad acting terrible punch lines and poor attempts to capitalize on fake support looking forward to ghostbusters 3 afterlife completely ignoring this dumpster fire oof
Feb 18 2020,negative,oh why oh why its really a disaster this is how you completely destroy what 12 build
Feb 12 2020,negative,boring and unfunny another franchise killed
Feb 12 2020,neutral,this movie is the epitome of garbage now i wont just compare it to the original because that would be unfair also it doesnt matter that it is an all female cast the movie is only bad becuase of the writing these characters arent likable or funny or relatable there is nothing tieing us to these characters also the jokes are just lazy there is a joke about dumplings some many times that it just shows how little effort was put in this the only reason i didnt put this at 1 star was entirely because of kate mkinnon and kristen wiig they are a bit one note but the acting was on point
Feb 11 2020,negative,i was very excited to see ghostbusters but this failed miserably while trying for something that is not ghostbusters   when i watched this i did jump back and watch the first one again to try to see and appreciate both but in the end it showed me that my movie was taken and wrapped around a terrible movie   this movie is not ghostbusters its an attempt to do the right thing but at the expanse and cost of the movie itself   please if you want people to listen dont make a movie or a show and wrap it around the ideology the idea is good but the vehicle is not supposed to be entertainment   people spend money on things they like
Feb 9 2020,negative,forced comedy  all that time spent watching this movie i wished i was watching the 80s ghostbusters
Feb 5 2020,negative,takes talent to gather a group of comedians and make them unfunny in a comedy it was just too forced and the pacing was off chris hemsworth makes it bearable
Feb 2 2020,positive,its not nearly as bad as people online make it out to be in fact it was actually a pretty delightful watch that being said the script is soooo weak the actors have to work their asses off to make it even serviceable i think its worth a watch if you have young kidsunder 12 and want to have fun at halloween with a goofy halloween movie
Jan 31 2020,negative,it was not good  it was too much snl jokes and bad timing  chris hemswroth was in itwhy
Jan 30 2020,negative,they could of found better girls for this role     this an money grab to take advantage of me too era  only noticable from the horrible acting
Jan 30 2020,negative,hemsworths character was the only decent part of this movie

Jan 17 2020,positive,hilarious and a great family movie
Jan 16 2020,negative,i could not stand this movie it feels like all the jokes are forced and they try to force nostalgia of the older franchise movies upon you they have to constantly remind you that this is a ghostbusters film but its farther from the ghostbusters film than anything i can describe
Jan 16 2020,negative,couldve benefited from a female director
Jan 15 2020,negative,ill keep it short this movie was simply not funny there were many other problems but at the end of the day that is its biggest sin
Jan 14 2020,negative,simply too childish and yet again too simple to be childish
Jan 14 2020,negative,i didnt think it was a good movie
Jan 13 2020,negative,horrible i feel bad for the original cast member that made cameos it was like watching an extended snl script and those already suck

Jan 5 2020,negative,not nearly as good as the original movies

Jan 4 2020,positive,definitely not as bad as some people make out not as good as the original but light hearted and fun

Dec 30 2019,negative,ghostbusters 2016 is a disaster of amovie that has unlikable characters a boring and messy plot and most of all its just not funny
Dec 30 2019,negative,feig and dippold should have gone full spoofmockbuster on this one instead of copypastereformatting the original had such high hopes for this all female cast but mckinnons was the only enjoyable or memorable performance mccarthy fell flat watching kevin was downright painful and somehow the cgi was worse than the 80s
Dec 27 2019,positive,i really dont get why people are so hating on it   its really funny and entertaining i really liked it alot
Dec 27 2019,negative,this film gets no stars at all except for the 2d hand drawn logo then turned into the cg glob of shit and some of the actresses like kristen wigg katie mckinnon and leslie jones who deserved a better script than this remake the 1984 version is superb and crisp the remake feels cliche and sloppy
Dec 26 2019,negative,isent funny  thats it
Dec 23 2019,positive,its hilarious its funny its good i recommend it
Dec 22 2019,negative,whats that are you serious
Dec 21 2019,negative,really unnecessary humor also very bad plus its the same movie i saw years ago the only difference is that there are women now
Dec 20 2019,negative,bad movie doesnt respect the original  characters bad lore inconsistent plot stupid characters feels like a mockbuster
Dec 19 2019,negative,i dont know what this dumpster fire was but definitely not a ghostbusters movie  i honestly thought they were gonna give us a passing of the torch movie where all these women were like the daughters of the og ghostbusters but nope  i cant lie though i did think the proton pistols the one ghostbuster made were pretty cool though  i honestly expected it to be funny to cuz i love melissa mccarthy but not even having thor in this movie could save it
Dec 19 2019,negative,unwatchable honestly  i tried i really did but omg it was so terrible  the cringe was so palatable
Dec 17 2019,positive,a good movie but it pales in comparison to the original i wish the ghost were more low tech rather than over cg like they were
Dec 16 2019,negative,this was horrible its like they didnt even try to make these characters believable even the characters in this movie act more like its a movie than something really happening to them what a shame
Dec 15 2019,negative,they have taken a beloved franchise and flushed it down the toilet with poor acting and pathetic writing  booo
Dec 15 2019,positive,hilarious and entertaining def reccomend
Dec 14 2019,negative,oh my god this movie stinks its like they hollywood just forgot or are too lazy to write a good story its like they are thinking as long as its diverse and woke enough we can always shameblame people to go watch or like the movie i really like some of the actresses and wanted to like the movie but it was just too dumb and lazy and they didnt have anything to work with
Dec 14 2019,negative,dont bother i really enjoyed the first two ghostbusters movies but this is terrible go watch ghostbusters 1984 better story better acting and a better movie hollywood should stop trying to recreateretell brilliant past films and come up with some fresh ideas
Dec 13 2019,negative,oof what a horrible movie
Dec 13 2019,negative,what an awful attempt at a reboot it had so much potential with a great cast and an ok story but the execution was so sloppy the comedy went too far in the wrong direction and it was distracting i would be interested in seeing another attempt with the same cast but with better writing
Dec 12 2019,negative,this movie was horrible cant wait for ghostbusters 2020
Dec 12 2019,negative,why this movie was terrible
Dec 12 2019,negative,what a pathetic movie an insult to the real ghostbusters movie that never needed a reboot
Dec 11 2019,negative,one of the worst  watch the original movies instead dont waste your time on this  even chris hemsworth and charles dance couldnt save this tragedy
Dec 10 2019,negative,trys too hard to be funny
Dec 10 2019,negative,im glad there are people that really enjoyed this movie but i was  not one of them i dont blame the actresses they are all solid performers to me it was just squeamishly unfunny
Dec 9 2019,neutral,i liked this movie a little more at the time but having seen it intheatres letting it gestate all my positivity wore off and theres just too many things that felt forced weak or just badly written and im not even talking about the humor for which they inflated merit a bit i felt like they took too many liberties with the concept and treated the beloved originals like antiquestrash not to mention for a sciencefiction movie it required a pretty heavy amount of suspension of disbelief example ghost parade balloons nothing was at stake there was no risk involved technically i suppose there was but i wasnt asked to care
Dec 3 2019,negative,this movie belongs in the cat box
Dec 3 2019,negative,the jokes were stupied not the smart jokes like in the first moives it wont be a movie that you need to watch more than once to understand all the humour it was not believable chris hemsworth was the worst character in the film in reality they should have left him at home with his helmet and orange vest no one that stupid should be on the street with out a escourt let alone hunting ghost
Dec 3 2019,negative,not good at all  why did they even bother  tarnished the franchise 
Dec 1 2019,negative,this movie shat on the legacy of ghostbusters
Nov 29 2019,positive,hilarious definitely worth watching
Nov 28 2019,negative,the jokes fall flat and there is no real understanding of the concepts that made the original a masterpiece of comedy
Nov 25 2019,positive,incredibly funny movie
Nov 21 2019,negative,uninteresting unfunny with primitive humor like fart jokes iq level far below original two movies
Nov 20 2019,negative,why would you ruin a classic with this horrible movie
Nov 18 2019,negative,the new things it brought to the table were interesting the tech and action looked really interesting the half hearted tributes and nostalgia dragged it down
Nov 18 2019,negative,what a piece of garbage
Nov 18 2019,negative,i feel asleep 2x trying to watch this dumpster fire
Nov 16 2019,positive,the special effects were cool and i thought it was pretty funny at least i dont recall them making condescending period jokes like in the old version
Nov 14 2019,negative,it was complete poo poo garbage
Nov 14 2019,negative,another political remake another failure the worst movie of the franchise by far this is meant to be a comedy and i can only laugh of the people that made this movie and though it was good
Nov 14 2019,negative,if you want to reboot a beloved franchise you need a great script this is not the case
Nov 13 2019,negative,this is a bad movie scooby doo effects ridden rubbish the script was painfully unfunny and you could tell the actresses knew it absolute garbage
Nov 12 2019,negative,horrible is an understatement
Nov 11 2019,negative,quite possibly the most unfunny comedy i have ever seen heavy overuse of cgi weak plot cringy cameos by original ghostbusters just fundamentally illconcieved and frankly unworthy of the ghostbusters licence a travesty
Nov 9 2019,negative,they killed my favourite movie
Nov 7 2019,negative,this film is ridiculous  its disrespectful to its core fans borrows all the good ideas from the other films and desecrates the lore of the series  i dont even consider it a part of the universe
Nov 7 2019,negative,its one job was to be funny and it failed
Nov 4 2019,negative,just plain terrible avoid this marketing campaign
Nov 3 2019,negative,a rotten movie from the top
Nov 2 2019,negative,dumpster fire of a movie
Nov 2 2019,negative,this movie was hot garbage  a terrible script with lame dialogue cartoonish cg and mediocre performances  the people involved with the film like to claim the disdain for it is rooted in sexism but that is obviously just a tactic to silence legitimate critics  even if you could have put the original cast members murray aykroyd ramis hudson in that film it still would have been awful  no performance could have saved that script and dialogue
Oct 31 2019,negative,characters are lame or have wasted potential the jokes are dry with two exceptions the ghosts designs are okay overall the movie is painfully dull
Oct 30 2019,negative,the whole movie is just one bad joke after another
Oct 30 2019,negative,watched it 3 years ago i couldnt say anything about the story as it was one of the most forgettable movies i have ever watched and i dont remember a thing besides the taste of vomit it left in my mouth a shame really knowing we all wanted a sequel for decades only to get this mess of a movie this truely sucked and it doesnt deserve such high ratings but im pretty sure this is the result of a sjw 5 stars raid i mean come on who would believe this genuinely got better ratings than joker
Oct 24 2019,negative,this movie has no reason to exist
Oct 24 2019,negative,this was painfully stupid   i kind of hoped that writing would have improved over 30 years
Oct 22 2019,negative,another remake that wasnt need 
Oct 22 2019,negative,remake that shouldnt have been made they should have done a continuation type thing and these women were the daughters of the original 4 maybe it wouldnt have bombed so badly 
Oct 20 2019,negative,a horrible idea from the start this film should have never been made
Oct 20 2019,negative,boring retread of a movie that did not need to be remade has none of the heart humor or originality of the first film they literally just piggy back off the old film and end up faceplanting on the dirty new york sidewalk the jokes all seem ad libbed and clumsy and the story beats are almost verbatim to the original why not come up with something fresh cgi puke everywhere in an attempt to add wow factor and it just ends up detaching the viewer from the action hollywood is out of ideas and they will continue to crap out retreads of every successful movie ever made barf
Oct 20 2019,negative,ugh not even close to the originals stop with the all feminist stuff just tells great story
Oct 19 2019,neutral,reboot anything but gbusters nice female cinema though
Oct 17 2019,positive,it was funny the plot was great and the actors were perfect for the characters
Oct 16 2019,negative,terrible terrible terrible how did this even get released
Oct 15 2019,negative,as bad as i expected the acting is woeful the story is dull the jokes full flat the three white ghostbusters are clever best in their field geniuses the black ghostbuster works on the subway why remake a classic especially this badly even the cgi was less than impressive the access media and those responsible for this garbage will try to tell you that if you hate this movie then you must be a misogynist who is somehow against female representation in cinema the truth is if you hate this film you have good taste and prefer classic to be either left alone or at the very least treated with the respect they deserve awful
Oct 14 2019,positive,great movie if you arent bogged down by the stereotypical 80s nostalgia than this is a hilarious walk in the park 1010 would recommend for anyone under 30
Oct 13 2019,negative,very few moments even got a chuckle from me 
Oct 13 2019,negative,i am a big fan of kristen wig and kate mckinnon leslie jokes and melissa mccarthy are funny also but the other 2 are incredibly good chris hemsworth is also a great actor with good comic abilities i am a person who likes the previous ghostbusters if you want a real comparison of this movie to the previous ghostbusters watch them back to back    that being said this is a review on ghostbusters 2016 and can i say this movie is a god awful joke uou have a strong cast and what do you do you make them make the lowest tier of potty humour apart from leslies character they dont react as normal people would to these situations    also this movie chops off pieces lines and song lyrics from the originals and tries to fit them in here which only makes it more cringy the cg looks terrible the original was in the 1980s and has the same monster in the very end to face off against stay puffed the original looked good actually kind of cheesy but good this one looks so bad also apparently by shooting it between the legs it hurts him like it would a man     that brings me to the next point the sexism sexism can work on all sexes not just women now i am all for equal rights there are many women in my life that i work hard for and if they wete ever paid for the same job less than me i would demand change i love my moms i have 3 my mom married my new mom and my dad married my new mom my sister my fiance and my gm why do i say this if i dont i actually might be judged on my sex for my opinion aka sexism    so in this movie all the male characters are morons weak andor deceitful the women are competent the women are strong and competent this type of portrayal if reversed would be hated by everyone this movie would have a single digit rating because the jokes and story are so bad so so bad     that brings me to the next part the story the story is an absolute mess it is like they chopped up different ideas and slapped them all together hoping that some kind of movie would come out of it    listen create your own story stop taking from the past have things equal 2 capable males 2 capable females have the jokes be intelligent write a structured story that makes sense have the characters react like real people in their situations actually would     stop wasting the talent of great comics and actors the people in this movie deserved better also stop putting agendas in movies like this strong arming these types of things takes you out of the movie that is the opposite effect a movie should have 
Oct 12 2019,negative,its not a terrible movie  but it aint great  it certainly doesnt hold a candle to the original  the script is awful  which is annoying given the cast  whilst i have an issue with this obsession with gender swap remakes new material instead please hollywood the main cast of ghostbusters are great comedic actors to be fair they arent so great in this movie  the special effects were also more casper the ghost than scary  and the original worked so well because it had real scares mixed with great comedy 
Oct 12 2019,negative,this was one of the most disappointing remakes of the 2010s yet again the dreaded remake derails another franchise this review will be too short to go over all of the complete crap that it contains so lets just jump it the original was lightning in a bottle if i am to use an already overused phrase they really did try hard with this and that is what made it a big steamy pile of ectoplasmic fodder the jokes fell as flat as amy schumers snl special when she forgot he note sheets it wasnt scary in any capacity the cgi was overused and looked shoddy it also felt like thier was a lot of adlibs in here a lot as in too much but the parts which hurt the most must of been the sad cameos the original actors return but not as their characters huh ive no idea what that was about if you are at all a fan of the original ghostbusters dont bother     people will call me a hater for this but to be quite fair i couldnt give a flying flamingo what you think     ghostbusters is more than awkward uninspired adlibs and fart jokes     that stuff went everywhere btw in every crack very hard to wash off    wow hilarious 
Oct 12 2019,negative,worst movie ever made it was like watching saturday night live with the volume up
Oct 10 2019,negative,now this is a terrible movie it takes the ghostbusters name and shits all over it crappy movie crappy special effects for all the claims of sexism against women when this came out the movie is completely sexist against men every male character is either an idiot or asshole even my sister said it sucks
Oct 9 2019,positive,finally watched it after three whole years since its release and its good not a masterpiece but its good entertainment    i watched the first movie once and it was more than a decade ago i was not even ten years old at the time so i barely remember it and i didnt watch the second movie because there was no french dubbed version and english is not my mother language this basically means that i had no expectations before watching this movie in its original versionwith subtitles in english though they were mostly not needed and it was quite the surprise    the movie is funny the actors are pretty good and the effects are glorious the beginning can rebuke some people as it starts slowly and awkwardly but it gets better while the plot progresses most jokes made me at least giggle and while some moments are more silly than funny its still a great comedy movie    
Oct 9 2019,negative,one of the worst movies i have ever seen for free
Oct 7 2019,positive,the all female reboot of ghostbusters is a very good film yhat does not deserve any of the hate it gets there are quite a few references to the original films and its got both childish and adult humour that will go over kids heads    theres a reference to two classic ghosts in the film plus liads of new ones the special effects are great and the battle scene near to the end is good especially as the films main villain is a face that anyone who knows the ghostbusters will recognise instantly
Oct 7 2019,negative,the improv is where this film fails which makes up 90 of the runtime  
Oct 6 2019,negative,really really bad please dont waste your time 
Oct 6 2019,negative,when i heard about the cast of this film i was impressed 4 out of the 5 are actors i genuinely enjoy but then the trailer hit and all i could think is this is the best of the film trailers usually ruin a lot of good material this only had bad material i kept an open mind when viewing the film but none of it worked total waste of talent    and for breaking new ground the film was pretty pathetic as it kept bad tropes alive why couldnt leslie jones be a professor with one of the other women in the underground and this isnt particularly about her race her delivery is the furthest thing from academic intellectual kinison in back to school killed yawn shes a worker beneath the others    all this movie proved is that despite most of the actors being of great comedic pedigree that doesnt mean that they are even amateur level improvisors the best improv is surprise improv following script until compelled to go off it feig and dippold were incredibly lazy or were pathetically inept screenwriters i dont care about the gender of the ghostbusters i care about the output so this movie got what it deserved jack squat because it offered jack squat 
Oct 5 2019,positive,i dont understand all the hate despite being a remake of a classici found this to be an enjoyable watch and the cameos from the original 84 cast added an extra ounce of nostalgia
Oct 5 2019,negative,how have the critics rated this film better than joker ridiculous
Sep 29 2019,negative,just such a terrible movie and a totally pointless re make
Sep 28 2019,negative,well yawn is about all i can say
Sep 27 2019,negative,long  but pointless
Sep 24 2019,negative,ill never get this time back do yourself a favour and hammer nails into your eyes instead itll be less painful 
Sep 24 2019,negative,terrible film that could have done with being slightly more self aware as a stunt to pull in the entertainment industry yes a one time work of art its a brilliant metacomedy however sometimes the marketing delivered the film as just a innocent alternate gender universe and nothing more and other times it was delivered as a controversial move to push feminististness you have to watch both to understand that the original was a film made during a time of ignorance to know that the remake is pointing out the flaws in the 1980s however modern day updating and things suggest that the film is trying to be as a sort of alternate universe while its still on and off camera having a bash at gender inequalities with the original ghostbusters being an example     if only there was something more memorable about it though one might have opportunity to ponder over it but it has all the attributes of most manufactured forgettable rubbish pumped out at rapid rate       cant be a satire of the old and try to replace the old at the same time its too conflicting if a complete satire it would be funny and i would feel interested in a replacement it could have just been a replacement that would have worked too     sometimes actor screen time feels very slippery but the picture is visually and colourfully nice the slapstick humour is funny too         
Sep 24 2019,positive,this is a good movie but has its ups and downs 
Sep 24 2019,negative,what a piece is 
Sep 24 2019,positive,there are some laughs to be had 
Sep 21 2019,negative,very poor in all aspects totally put the franchise down   what a pity
Sep 18 2019,negative,very cheesy the original was way better hope the 2020 one fares better
Sep 18 2019,negative,it was a massive let down no where near any of the originals
Sep 17 2019,negative,one of the worst movies ive ever seen what does puke and fart jokes have to do with the elegant comedy of the ghostbusters franchise why are all the characters constantly improvising bad jokes the plot makes no sense and every man in the movie is either stupid or evil this movie reeks of feminist propaganda the critics who voted it fresh have sold their souls
Sep 17 2019,negative,casting is aweful and the film smells of desperation for acceptance that leaves the plot completely forgettable 
Sep 17 2019,negative,good grief this really got made
Sep 14 2019,positive,great snl cast very funny and at the end of the day its just a fun movie  80
Sep 12 2019,negative,bottom of the barrel humor mixed with poorly directed action and over use of mediocre cgi    just an all around misstep
Sep 10 2019,negative,the actresses were all great and chris was halarious but the story and effects are a big stinker 
Sep 10 2019,negative,an insult to a generation  an insult to all women
Sep 10 2019,negative,boring waste of time unfunny pointless the cgi looked out of date to many fart jokes and they never stopped talking to let any of the jokes even have a chance to work a movie can be prowomen without being antimale but i dont think this movie was proanyone
Sep 9 2019,neutral,the female cast are top but the material is often unfunny to the point of irritation
Sep 8 2019,negative,was a whaste of timeforced jokes and useless cameos
Sep 8 2019,negative,dont watch this just watch the old ones 
Sep 6 2019,negative,why do they keep doing this to classics not entertaining at all
Sep 6 2019,negative,i really hope this isnt the last time someone tries to run with ghostbusters i loved this series as a kid and really had high hopes because of how much i love melissa mccarthy but this movie really fell flat  
Sep 5 2019,negative,this movie is hot garbage
Sep 5 2019,negative,this was the worst movie i have ever watched save yourself and dont do it
Sep 4 2019,negative,others have said it much more eloquently than i could but its clear that this pandering and pointless remake was the result of a radical left wing agenda thats infested our media and pop culture    this was the movie that no one wanted and it was clear from the start that the media tried to hide the fact that it was terrible behind cries of misogyny
Sep 4 2019,negative,one of the worst movies ive ever seen its the perfect example of a director who is too scared to tell the actors what to do and the result is a series of scenes that feel like they have no connection to each other total waste of talent
Sep 2 2019,negative,hah this movie was crap total cash grab snl skit with scooby doo monsters unleashed cgi effects
Sep 2 2019,negative,it seemed as if this movie was made by a fly wondering continuously throughout a room never quite having a point
Sep 2 2019,negative,mckinnon and hemsworth were hilarious but their respective parts couldnt save the overall train wreck that was this puerile remake
Sep 1 2019,negative,dear god  good thing i didnt spend the money to watch this in the theaters and just caught it on cable  such a horrible movie
Sep 1 2019,negative,despite the amazing talent in the cast jokes are few and mediocre the story weak  and all characters immediately forgettable 
Aug 30 2019,negative,first 20 minutes are good then it goes down the hill not funny at all total disappointment 
Aug 29 2019,neutral,some jokes hit and alot missed the mark this film did recieve alot of backlash over the female casting but that wasnt the issue for me whatsoever the plot was okay some of the ghosts looked cool and some effects looked awful but it was neither an overly funny comedy nor a scary thriller with a weak villain in tow 255 
Aug 29 2019,negative,wellthe movie fans wanted to see for decades never has seen the light of day instead we got a movie with worse effects than the original and bad humor nobody asked for the facts that this film gets the backlash isnt a female cast the exact same movieas it iswould be garbage too if the new ghostbusters would have dicks instead 
Aug 28 2019,positive,review  ghostbusters is an american supernaturalcomedy film directed by paul feig it is a reboot of the 1984 film of the same name and is the third film in ghostbusters franchise i watched this movie over half a dozen times now and i swear it gets more and more funny every time i watch it i really believe that people are just stuck in their ways and will never come to terms that anybody can play any character this movie is called ghostbusters and has the same premise as the original but it tells a different story entirely  the story focuses on four women melissa mccarthy kristen wiig kate mckinnon and leslie jones and their assistant chris hemsworth who begin a ghostcatching business in new york city  everybody in this movie is so funny each actor played their role perfectly when the movie needed to be more than just funny they got the actors who can act do those roles  melissa mccarthy and kristen wiig  thats not taking anything away from the amazing and wonderful that is kate mckinnon the characters are great but the main trio really take this movie to heights that not even i would have expected  no where is the story does it say that the characters had to be played by men nor did it say it had to be played by women the creators of the film decided on what they thought would work best and it turned out be a funny and entertaining film get on board with the equality train people its 2019 and anybody can do anything they want story comedy and characters i really enjoyed they did a good job playing homage to the original film and characters however they stretch it out throughout the whole film and intertwin the easter eggs into the story itself and i found myself at times being taken out of the main story because of it  overall this it not your 1984 ghostbusters if you can get past that and actually enjoy the story that a new generation is trying to tell you can really enjoy this film  355
Aug 27 2019,negative,dumb the best word to describe this movie i always said that uwe boll is the lowest of the lowest out there but this film made me realize some new stuff firstly how the so called critics are sold out secondly that i really really have to watch out for what i pay when i want to watch some good moviethis one is the worst movie ever
Aug 27 2019,positive,i love this movie so much paul feig is a brilliant director the female ensemble is hilarious and chris helmsworth is a great addition to the cast 
Aug 27 2019,positive,if you get past the nostalgia of what made the first 2 og movies the ghostbusters reboot aint that bad kate mckinnon is hilarious as well as my fav leslie jones it had its laughs and good moments although the cgi is laughable by todays standards this flick made its way into my collection after i spent money in the theater a few years ago 
Aug 27 2019,negative,blah i have watched this 7 times and it never gets better the writing sucks donkeys the actors had potential to do better but it ends up just a puffy blah that blah blah blah and blah in the end but what do i know i just collect spores mold and fungus
Aug 25 2019,negative,i didnt watch this for quite a while because i heard so many bad things about it what do they know i thought to myself i figured ghostbusters had already had a bad sequel i sort of enjoyed a bad remake should be sort of enjoyable too besides you just know that so many of the complaints were exclusively because the cast had been of the dreaded female version variety but i just watched it and oh man you guys this really did suck im devastated
Aug 24 2019,negative,dont reboot classics hard pass 2022 mar 01 update how is this steaming pile of a movie still rated fresh by critics should that  match reality a bit more
Aug 22 2019,negative,wow way to destroy a classic no set roles every character was comic relief slap stick or serious bad just bad
Aug 21 2019,negative,not funny or exciting lackluster cgi effects and unnecessarily stirring controversy the only ghost that gets busted is the franchises reputation
Aug 19 2019,negative,poorly written and directed
Aug 18 2019,negative,horrible movieslow predictable without grace  and the score they were given is 74  if you are afraid of feminism give up being film critics  leave the job to more committed people
Aug 16 2019,positive,adore this movie such great acting and so many laughs
Aug 16 2019,positive,definitely top 10 for me maybe the movie ive seem the most  growing up loving the original ghost busters indiana jones and other amazing movies i saw myself as the hero like most viewers   i never knew how cathartic a female led version of one of my favorite movies would be  i always saw past gender to see myself as the hero and i never realized how great it would be to do less work  
Aug 16 2019,positive,chris hemsworth was hilarious kate mckinnon was queer and adorable and hilarious and the doughboy joke was stupid    i had fun watching it
Aug 15 2019,negative,dont waste your time its not funny and was obviously pushing an agenda if you want to watch a good ghostbusters movie you have two other great options flat out not funny
Aug 14 2019,negative,packed with forced diversity cancerous feminism and all of the progressive ideals that make a conscious person repulsed it is obviously cultural subversion and pandering to the snowflake ideology 
Aug 13 2019,negative,thank god feminism has arrived to offer us timeless cinematic masterpieces like this wonderful movie 
Aug 13 2019,positive,this movie was actually pretty good i liked it it had some flaws but its pretty good i recommend it 
Aug 11 2019,negative,this movie is an insult to the original nuff said
Aug 6 2019,positive,it wasnt as funny as they wanted it to be but it didnt need to be a comedy to be good
Aug 5 2019,negative,zero stars  help im blinded help i cant see this movie took my eyesight 
Aug 5 2019,positive,despite what many might say this movie does an excellent job of getting laughs and keeping things interesting what it doesnt do is cater strictly to nostalgia by simply rehashing whats already be done so many times before the cast is amazing and the writing is witty saw it in the theater and i watch it on bluray every few months or so
Aug 3 2019,negative,not funny in the slightest and has a female empowerment agenda that you cant not see when watching
Jul 31 2019,positive,great comedy made me laugh all throughout it
Jul 29 2019,positive,its actually a fun movie to watch if you dont compare it to the original movies which ive never watched maybe if it had a different title it would be more accepted by the audience
Jul 29 2019,negative,the characters are as bland as much as the movie is a ripoff of the original first ghostbusters
Jul 25 2019,positive,i did not care for this movie im not saying it was a totally bad movie id say it was good for the new generation but for people who grew up watching the original in the 80s may not like it so much i think they should have made the movie like a passing of the torch where the guys passes the business over to the girls since egon harold ramis past away sort of a tribute to him i think it would have made a better story line 
Jul 24 2019,negative,one of the worst reboots ever
Jul 24 2019,positive,who you gonna call overaverage remake movie with just girls instead of the original amazing ghostbusters
Jul 23 2019,positive,can be summed up by a single sentence men  chads wamen  heroez
Jul 22 2019,negative,i wanted to see this but so much bad press and political correctness i never got around to it  well i am happy i did not see it in theaters  another remake where they are more interested in meeting an agenda rather than making a good movie  i hope someday someone will understand if they remake a movie they think they can do it better maybe fix some plot issue update graphics  or twist on the original  this movie really did none of the above well other than twisting the plot to be politically correct  there was a couple grins in the movie so it lowest rating but i wish i could unsee this train wreck 
Jul 21 2019,negative,25  leslie jones is solid and the visual effects are awesome but mccarthy and mckinnon are annoying and the jokes are hitandmiss
Jul 21 2019,negative,this movie made an honest effort but lacked the charisma of the original tbe cast lacked chemistey and just didnt seem to mesh if people hadnt been looking dor another ghostbusters movie i dont think anyone would have noticed it
Jul 21 2019,negative,terrible movie shouldve made its own direction in its own unique way  basically attempted to crush the classic design and comedy
Jul 20 2019,negative,complete trash mascarading for ghostbusters the actors arent bad but the timing jokes script pacing ad libs and literally everything else sucks the fact that its following the same basic template as original gb and doesnt have any confidence in itself doesnt help
Jul 20 2019,negative,very disappointing feiminist agenda again so tired of this nonsense worst was  jillian holtzmann character and act too very disappointing liked chris   hemsworths performance 
Jul 20 2019,negative,the movie was terrible for the following reason  tacky dialogue  bad slapstick comedy  lacked any deadpan comedy moments  disregarded previous franchise references  felt like a movie with a gender change and no thought to the fan base  it failed as a movie not because of any gender agenda it was simply a bad movie which is reflected in the loss made in making of this movie its hard to dispute that fact when a movie makes a loss means even the fan base werent interested in seeing it   
Jul 16 2019,positive,ghostbusters do an impressive feat that is to be as good as the original through the delicate direction by paul feig the screenplay by katie dippold and feig the performances of melissa mccarthy kristen wiig kate mckinnon leslie jones and chris hemsworth the charming soundtrack by theodore shapiro and the highquality visual effects that live up to the budget of 144 million
Jul 14 2019,positive,im giving a 5 star partially to balance out all the 1 stars this movie has received  this movie is fun and surprisingly funny  its a light hearted fluff entertainment  loved the kid ass women
Jul 14 2019,negative,this movie is made up of an neverending series of unfunny annoying boring unintelligible adlibs sony has made it their mission to create a mountain over a molehill by ignoring positive or inoffensive comments on the trailer on youtube creating an marketing campaign over a tiny fraction of misogynistic comments so as to pull this movie higher than it ever deserved to sonys film department has completely lost its integrity over the years as seen from the horrible amazing spiderman movies to the painful pixels not to mention their hacking scandal which seems to have been forgotten since their appeal for this piece of crap this remake is not funny original or worth anyones time and no one should feel bad for hating this film anyone who sticks by this marketing scam is either lying to themselves a hypocrite or in sonys pocket please do not waste your time with this pile of dog shit
Jul 13 2019,negative,imagine ghostbusters with women  horrible concept lacking any originality or laughs 
Jul 12 2019,negative,starting off as a mediocre movie it quickly devolved under the weight of its problems acting kate mckinnon is constantly on but the majority of her parts are not funny enough to warrant her attempting to steal the spotlight her rendition of crazy spunky scientist just feels false as the majority of scientists like that would have blown themselves up already mccarthy by far the strongest actress in the movie giving room to her costars comedically as well as playing a convincing ghost possession wiig alright but doesnt stand out jones holy racial stereotypes batman murrays cameo was alright but ackroyds felt forced and hudsons was completely irrelevant overall the reactions of people were off there isnt a good reaction to mccarthy firing off deadly laser beams out of control nor do audiences like the metalheads seem believable also the metal really was crappy caseys villain portrayal was mediocre and boring hemsworth portrayal while posessed was fun but the charisma difference from casey made it feel like a disjoint effort completely caseys fault the overplaying of identity politics hampers both the humor and believability of the movie overall the humor is hit and miss and miss     while the first half of the movie was mediocre the next half while special effect filled felt strung together as if a bunch of 11yearolds were just throwing out ideas its a complete mess comedy and empathy wise devolving into a horribly acted baction movie
Jul 11 2019,negative,terrible cgi how can you replace practical effects haggard
Jul 10 2019,positive,i loved this film especially as a woman and a scientist the original ghostbusters was cool when i was a kid but very disappointing i love bill murray but his character was a giant creep and not just that but as a chemist and clinical researcher nothing they said made sense at least the new one tried to use scientific terminology in a correct way but most of all the new one was hilarious and had great battles im super sad that toxic fan boys and the the unavailability of the chinese film market to air a ghostbased film hurt this film so much i so wish they would make another with these ladies in the titular roles 
Jul 10 2019,negative,this reboot should be in the dumped its nothing but a sjw film
Jul 10 2019,negative,its just the original ghostbusters but with woman you can easily skip this and not miss anything
Jul 9 2019,negative,god that was awful mindless drivel not funny either
Jul 9 2019,negative,we are so sick to death with your forced 3rd reich feminist agenda imagine if  next movie we ended by killing a female antagonists with proton packs to the vag
Jul 7 2019,negative,no just no this should never have been done this is not a movie this is a train crash
Jul 4 2019,negative,im very upset that is movie was made sony disrespected the wellknown ghostbusters franchise by releasing a remake instead of the full sequel to the original
Jul 4 2019,negative,bad reboot and bad comedy good vfx 
Jul 4 2019,positive,alright not the stars fault just a mediocre movie 
Jul 2 2019,negative,sucked on so many levels 
Jun 30 2019,neutral,i had no issue with it focusing on four women i thought mckinnen mcarthy wiig and jones all nailed their roles unfortunately they were the only good thing about the movie the plot the writing and the directing were poor imho     which is a shame because i wanted to see all the haters men who are offended by women being the leads proved wrong 
Jun 26 2019,negative,the majority of the film is hit and miss but the ongoing feud is that all men are evil is a complete joke to all fans i admit it would be funny with ghostbusters being men and women in certain environment that could be funny but the way it led to being a toxic fandom film it missed the point entirely now ive watched both versions of the film and after about five tries with it im entirely done with it the original film was much darker creepy and entirely a laugh riot and ive seen it multiple times this new one is bright overly saturated with cgi and it makes the setup without the big payoff at the end i dont think its a horrible film but i just find it lackluster some of it was funny other times it wasnt
Jun 20 2019,negative,couldnt even sit through the whole movie terrible
Jun 18 2019,positive,funny really funny stupid at times but it was good
Jun 17 2019,positive,i loved it all of the ladies are hilarious and so is chris hemsworth i dont know what the rest of these people are talking about because i can watch this over and over and i loved the originals too
Jun 16 2019,negative,this really did not have to happen
Jun 16 2019,negative,well only chris hemsworths performance really saves it from being a total disaster a waste of so many talents
Jun 15 2019,negative,cringe pure cringe
Jun 14 2019,negative,this movie is garbage threw it in the bin because it belongs with the rubbish   ghost busters 3 sucks big time 
Jun 11 2019,negative,so bad mediocre comedy wanna be that has no memorable characters and an incredible dull plot the fx are good the rest is so forgettable cant wait for the real ghostbusters 3 to be made this one wont even be remembered as canon
Jun 11 2019,negative,they need to stop trying to piggyback ride off of a good franchise
Jun 11 2019,negative,i despise this abomination if i had 3 wishs i would kill hitler cure cancer and fucking delete this abomination 
Jun 11 2019,negative,not worthy of the name 
Jun 10 2019,negative,awful  i wish i could unsee it and mostly unhear it
Jun 9 2019,negative,very poor acting all round the mad member of the team was so annoying it killed the film and the receptionist guy was so unbelievable it ruined the whole concept of the filmi suggest people go and see the original 80s version its exactly the same film plot and so much more skill in the acting
Jun 9 2019,negative,why doesnt hollywood realise that women are not going to stop being oppressed with some subpar shallow excuses for reboots  virtue signalling at its finest catering for people that like to feel they have done their bit for society without actually exerting any effort
Jun 9 2019,positive,totally hilarious chriss dance was refreshing  the actresses were bubbly  i loved kate
Jun 9 2019,negative,i like the idea of a female ghostbusters crew i just dont think the script was written very well it made me cringe rather than laugh at most scenes including the scene where chris hemsworths character starts controlling people and forcing them to pose in certain ways overall if it had a better script it probably would have been a much better movie 
Jun 8 2019,positive,if you see ghostbusters 2016 try not to compare it to the original by the same name in 1984  this is not an exact retelling of the same story with the same script using different actors im not sure that would work anyway  this film is still a lot of fun and kate mckinnon steals every scene shes in  mckinnon should be credited with developing a completely original ghostbusters character and one perfectly suited to her  mccarthy is basically finding her comic legs here doing a admirable job with the material but not straying too far from her tv personae on mike  molly  there is a lot of cgi as you would expect with all of the supernatural elements
Jun 7 2019,positive,i loved the movie the characters are amazing and the references to the old movies are so well puted melissa mccarthy and leslie jones made me laugh so much and chris hemsworth as a dumb damselindistress is a totaly must see
Jun 5 2019,negative,another great franchise hijacked by an agenda
Jun 2 2019,negative,i liked it a little bitbut it just wasnt that great compared to the original
May 31 2019,negative,this reboot had no reason to be made the humor was flat and stale and essentially nothing was added to the original by rebooting it that would have made this merely a cynical cash grab worse slathering it with wokeness made it obnoxious
May 31 2019,positive,it may not be the best ghostbusters movie but it still offer humor and jokes this ghostbusters new reboot still entertain the audience
May 29 2019,positive,i liked this movie despite all the backlash from social media it was funny the cast was great the cgi was awesome the movie didnt disappoint each character brought their own comedy to the mix which worked great altogether
May 28 2019,positive,im still not sure why people didnt like this movie better  it was outstanding  i loved the first ghostbusters but only watched them a couple of times  ive seen this movie over and over again  it is still one of the funniest movies with the best casts and director ive ever seen  
May 26 2019,positive,i enjoyed this movie it has good moments but what i didnt like is that every male character in this movie is portrayed in a negative way and that to me is sexist
May 25 2019,negative,poorly written cliche film most scenes gave me a sense of cringe or left me irritated
May 23 2019,negative,how much time do you have
May 20 2019,positive,i in the highlights thought this will ruin the movie and now i like it   the woman make it funny and entertaining i think its fun and as enjoyable as the original
May 19 2019,negative,crap crap and mega crap being a giant fan of ghostbusters i figured id give this a chance turned it off 35 minutes into it just that bad the blonde hair character is annoying and i mean super annoying i thought leslie jones would be funny she was dry and offered nothing to the cast chris hemsworths character was useless and stupid kristen wig was okay melissa mccarthy was just okay too the movie was uninteresting the jokes didnt land annoying and stupid film that didnt need to be made but its out there none the less
May 19 2019,negative,this was terrible a complete waste of time
May 16 2019,negative,the ghostbusters film of 2016 is a fine example of what not to do with a reboot  a reboot if its to be made should be created to appeal to old audiences and introduce new audiences mad max fury road did this by appealing to the originally male audience and including appeal to women as well the dark knight did this by appealing to those who loved batman in his original fantastic premise and also appealed to those who loved gritty realism and moral dilemma  ghostbusters 2016 failed to do this by trying to appeal to female audiences at the cost of the movies old predominantly male audience they took a movie about men with likable female characters and replaced it with a movie solely about women whose men are either idiotic malevolent or both
May 14 2019,negative,what a poorly written poorly acted and visually stupid movie
May 13 2019,positive,this movie is just full of laughes and odd ball characters that you instantly fall in love with especially melissa mccarthy who plays the darling character abby who steals the spot light every time she appears on screen oh and the characters coming together as a team building trust and simply having fun while trying to solve the mystery at handis entertaining this is not a serious movie nor is it necessarily a remake sure it loosely has some resemblance of the same plot line as the original not at all but the movie is its own along with the characters who are their own unique beings so if you want some good laughes like movies with ghosts or are just a fan of melissa mccarthys i suggest this movie    my not so professional review  i love melissa mccarthy as abby  i adore all the female actresses  the movie is oneofakind   all the women are funny   you cant go wrong with that  i want to give orgasms to abby  while she tries to tell me that ghosts are real  lol jk jk 
May 12 2019,negative,one of the most disappointing movies of all timeright next to  highlander 2 and indiana jones 4 among the movies history would be better off without
May 8 2019,negative,politics aside this is a bad movie i enjoyed the all female reboot of the oceans movie this movie is tragicly unfunny distateful and stale hemmsworth trys to bring his charm to this movie and it is completely wasted
May 4 2019,positive,is the reboot of ghostbusters the greatest comedy ever hell no does it have problems oh absolutely the cgi is horrible and some jokes fall flat however the chemistry of the actresses more than some of the jokes do land and the variety of the action kicks ass    even if you didnt like it there were clearly worse movies in 2016
May 4 2019,positive,i skipped seeing this gem in theaters because of all the bad hype about it a decision i wholeheartedly regret    as with all paul feigs films ghostbusters answer the call is a laughoutloud experience with great action sequences that the whole family can enjoy    some criticize the men as being dumbed down or purposefully rudeignorant in this film but theyre really on par with most of the bit characters in the original    as someone who grew up with the original films cartoons and comics im glad to say that this reboot is a refreshing take on the franchise thatll leave you feeling nostalgic and wanting more
May 4 2019,negative,wouldnt recommend in theaters or on video or bootlegged for free garbage movie from storyline to acting just a pc political stunt from hwood leftists
May 1 2019,negative,this movie is insulting bad they should be ashamed of them selves for their actions regarding advertising this trash movie using woman empowerment  americas current hate for white men  to try to get every sad pitiful view they could for what may be the worst movie of the decade 
Apr 30 2019,negative,bland and stupid banks off nostalgia and women  waste of time and money watch the original one instead please
Apr 29 2019,positive,a great take on a classic with a stella cast laughed loads a very fun film
Apr 27 2019,negative,a disappointment much prefer the 1st and 2nd
Apr 25 2019,positive,a wrong definition of feminism doesnt sink this entertaining film
Apr 25 2019,negative,imagine ghostbusters but take away the brevity the wit the expertly pieced screenwriting the concise communication of core plot points and innovate storytelling then replace all of that with clumsily executed slapstick lengthy scenes of characters spouting gibberish in perhaps the worst attempt ever made to show characters are intelligent recycled elements that are similar enough to be unoriginal but too different to incite nostalgia and ultimately a product which is devoid of all the character that made the original so iconic  if the fact the cast is allfemale appeals to you and is enough to carry the movie then watch it otherwise avoid this dumpsterfire
Apr 24 2019,negative,what happened to ghostbusters this is horrible
Apr 22 2019,positive,a cool film with great special effects
Apr 21 2019,negative,absolute unfunny garbage this is an insult to the original
Apr 17 2019,negative,this film is absolute trash i liked the idea of an all female ghostbusters crew and the cast had great potential but to make a reboot is just plain stupid it could have been some kind of sequel that acknowledged and followed the original films but instead we got this pathetic joke of a film what a waste of a great opportunity aside from the reboot nonsense the plot is boring special effects feel like its a childish madefortvmovie the characters lines and development are contrived flat and foolish the ghost busting equipment looks like stuff built out of garbage and the hq is a cheep filthy garage this is not a ghostbusters film in any way other than by name
Apr 14 2019,negative,aside from the gender controversy surrounding the film if you gave men the same jokes to tell theyd also fall flat
Apr 13 2019,positive,is a very incredible movie i like the woman characters is very diferent and very funny
Apr 7 2019,negative,this reboot is nothing but senseless garbage its not worth watching at all the cameos couldnt even help the movie in anyway shape or form
Apr 7 2019,negative,if you like this movie please dont talk to me
Apr 4 2019,negative,pretty pathetic worth a miss
Apr 1 2019,negative,this movie is like a 2 hour snl skit which is fine if you do not want a tight plot rebooting a great movie is a tough job often bombs as a result there is too improv and characters donï 12tmt feel real the tone is inconsistent from the start and every character is trying to out joke the other villians have no real motivation and the cgi is cringy skip it and watch the original
Mar 30 2019,negative,bad jokes bad acting  id like to undo watching it
Mar 26 2019,negative,plot was mediocre and story was underdeveloped no character development at all act 1 to act 3  other than chris but thats another issue  imagine a hs tribute to ghostbusters and then throw money at it
Mar 21 2019,negative,absolutely hated it it was terrible 
Mar 19 2019,negative,the original ghostbusters movie is one of the best comedy movies ever made  this is the exact opposite
Mar 17 2019,negative,this movie was horrible where is the original cast
Mar 16 2019,neutral,it was a funny and family friendly movie
Mar 16 2019,negative,this is a comedy that isnt funny
Mar 16 2019,negative,i waited till now to watch this to avoid all the hype and bias    its dire i laughed once cant remember at exactly what but it was one line from a side character who appeared just for the line lack of laughs aside its way too long meandering and desperately thin on story and characterisation  couple of hours of my life i wont get back
Mar 15 2019,negative,watched this on netflix with my wife it was hot garbage we both hated it terrible jokes why must you continue to reboot classics and absolutely ruin them
Mar 14 2019,negative,horrible pointless movie nothing was funny in this movie
Mar 13 2019,negative,absolutely horrible film a remake is never even close to the original this remake was almost made to completely trash the original would not recommend at all
Mar 12 2019,negative,poorly written and unlikeable characters made this movie the mess it isdont blame the men
Mar 12 2019,positive,it was not as bad as the reviews would lead you to believe  the script was seriously lacking and the movie seemed to drag on and on but it did have some very funny moments here and there
Mar 11 2019,negative,dismal get a classic and ruin it i have seen pokã cmon episodes with more comedy please please dont destroy anymore classics
Mar 11 2019,negative,a movie i wanted to like but didnt
Mar 10 2019,positive,best film of the decade
Mar 10 2019,negative,should not have benn made
Mar 10 2019,positive,recap of the 80s box office success with an allfemale hero cast ist just as silly as the original but likewise mildly entertaining
Mar 9 2019,negative,they had the perfect cast the right amount of money and the right hype  do you know what this movie lacked plot chemistry subtlety rewatch the original ghostbusters and realize that the characters are completely at home in the movieworld the line between 1984 new york and the world of the supernatural was easier to cross because there was no look into the camera and smile and wink mentality it was a buddyfilm written by two great comedy writers who also had a vested interest in the paranormal history and metaphysics there is substance in the movie that most viewers dont understand but it aids in the overall digestion of the film as a whole    2016s reboot accomplishes none of this what does this movie have fart jokes asian food delivery jokes too many quirky characters jesus christ the characters were like cartoon caricatures wearing people skin feig and the writers took a cast of amazing women who with proper direction and a good script could have proven that an all girl ensemble could have worked    i like women i think theyre great i think that women deserve proper representation but theres a problem that comes along with deliberate hamfisting of an agenda into what should be a buddy movie thats what ghostbusters is at its core just a bunch of new yorkers dealing with the extraordinary not 4 cartoon characters chasing down an even more cartoony villain and fighting the logo    they fight the logo guys the logo they fight it there is no lore established there is no explanation it was just a pandering cashgrab    they wasted these wonderfully talented women and the money on this crappy film
Mar 9 2019,neutral,poorly written and directed
Mar 9 2019,positive,this movie was funny and enjoyable  i dont understand the poor audience score  wigg is always great and the rest were pretty great too  the thor guy was great  story was good
Mar 9 2019,negative,i thought they tried little too hard to be funny did not like it
Mar 9 2019,negative,disappointing as well a true abomination     the sad part is the acting isnt that bad there is only one of the female ghostbusters who i would say has zero acting ability the rest of the ladies were pretty good  its the directing and the script that are unsalvageable     the reason i am not giving this half a star even though its a top 3 worst film i have ever seen is because the acting was okay it was the only thing good about this film    if the cast had a better script this could have been something special
Mar 9 2019,negative,this movie is horrible not funny no definitive story plot
Mar 9 2019,negative,worst remake ever i had to go to the bathroom and throw up
Mar 9 2019,negative,feels like a cheap clone of the original
Mar 9 2019,negative,as a woman i should be able to rate this movie without it be censored since this movie stars a female cast rotten tomatoes my opinion should count even if it goes against the opinions of this site please post my rating this time
Mar 8 2019,negative,very bad movies the last one was mush batter
Mar 8 2019,positive,i really wanted to like this movie however the script was so bad and the actors did not even seem like they wanted to be there it was almost as if they wanted to make a movie to make fun of the fans i just did not get that
Mar 8 2019,negative,a total mess not recommended
Mar 8 2019,negative,biggest dumpster fire of a movie featuring 4 women who dont know they are annoying and unfunny and sexist against the opposite sex all trying desperately to get people to like them there is no comedic timing or pause for effect for the jokes to land they just keep talking and talking with poop and fart jokes

Feb 27 2019,negative,a terrible reboot of a perfectly good established universe  it lacked the charm and comraderie of the original films and struggles to maintain a coherent plot and sympathetic characters sony literally dug up the grave of harold ramis and took a massive dump on his creative genius then forced the original cast through legal coercion to publicly promote this garbage the wholly original content that dan akyrod and harold ramis devised was completely betrayed to the massively established fan base in the hopes that no one would notice the dismal failure of this film at the box office is the price they pay
Feb 26 2019,negative,it wasnt funny which is strange considering it was supposed to be a comedy
Feb 26 2019,negative,a complete slog of a film a reboot that spits and shames the legacy of the reitman 1984 classic
Feb 26 2019,negative,the cringe is immense
Feb 26 2019,negative,this movie does no justice to the name ghostbusters as we all knew it

Feb 26 2019,negative,tried to watch this garbage a few times but did not manage
Feb 26 2019,negative,shameful is the only word i can think of when this movie came to the theaters what a sexist boring yet cringing story i wanted to see the men that were in the older ghostbusters in the 2016 version not a bunch on random women not to mention that the story was blandthe only thing i wish for right now would to able to rate this movie with zero stars
Feb 26 2019,negative,this movie was not funny all the jokes felt severely forced i dont care one way or the other that it had an all female cast i just didnt find it funny
Feb 26 2019,negative,terrible reboot of a beloved franchise for the sake of catering to identity politics  feminism
Feb 26 2019,negative,this dont need to exist
Feb 25 2019,negative,total garbage i dont understand how sony allowed this crap to exist another top franchise ruined
Feb 25 2019,negative,ill admit i didnt watch it but im testing if rt will let me post a review im banned from captain marvel for some reason
Feb 25 2019,negative,this movie is so bad i would say its laughable but really then they would get credit for that so no it should have never been made
Feb 25 2019,negative,terrible movie that has a political agenda keep politics out of hollyweird

Feb 25 2019,negative,one of the worst movies ever how can anyone like this sh
Feb 25 2019,negative,it was awful start to finish cringe worthly jokes lots of shouting to get jokes over to u no need too they were that awful the falling over slapstick comedy was bad with all its faults with gb2 it was a far better film than this far better i could go on but ill stop now
Feb 25 2019,negative,graphics were amazing cast and story was a turn off
Feb 25 2019,negative,an insult to the gosthbusters legacy
Feb 25 2019,negative,this was a turd pure propaganda and a wast of time this is a prime example of how the political left is injecting politics into our entertainment cant wait for the real ghostbuster sequel in 2020 this should have been called 4 feminists with special effects and speaking rolesthis movie by no means is part of the ghostbusters collection this is an unfunny waste of time this film proved hollywood writers and producers rather indoctrinate rather than entertain and that 4 women should never be allowed on screen again
Feb 25 2019,negative,awful loweffort cash in the writers and performers seemed to misunderstand the source material and what made it popular     terrible cg awful cameos from the original cast and lame jokes make this an uncomfortable waste of time
Feb 25 2019,negative,oh dear oh dear nothing good to say about this is there
Feb 24 2019,negative,if you asked me why make this movie i would honestly answer i dont know it was loud brash seemingly aloof and not funny at all i think some of the comedians are awesome in other projects but in this film they all fall flat no life no love for this movie ghostbusters died with this reboot
Feb 24 2019,negative,calling the movie ghostbusters only is misleading new audience will never know about the original everyone was advising me to not watch it but i did anyway lot of cringe clips and mediocrity
Feb 24 2019,negative,i thought it was interesting  mckinnon was really fun to watch and wiig bounced between comedy and drama to a dizzying degree  mccarthy stayed firmly in comedic mode
Feb 24 2019,positive,not the worst movie ive ever seen  comedy is much more low brow than the original films  not enough horror and too cartoonish  would have still watched a sequel to this if they had made it but much more excited that they are returning to the original continuity
Feb 24 2019,negative,the agenda of stupid men vs different women is cringy
Feb 24 2019,negative,finally saw this steaming heap of crap really looking forward to the real new ghostbusters movie
Feb 24 2019,positive,i enjoyed this new cult classic with fun adventures witty comedy and nostalgic references great movie
Feb 24 2019,negative,couldnt finish the movie this could be used instead of water boarding to break people
Feb 24 2019,negative,how all that feminist propoganda work out
Feb 24 2019,negative,this movie is the worst
Feb 24 2019,negative,this movie was bad and there isno other word to describe it
Feb 24 2019,negative,an absolute insult to its predecessor it seemed to care more about the fact that the cast was female and continuously reminding the audience of that fact rather than telling an actually compelling story
Feb 24 2019,negative,feminist propaganda garbage film worthy of the dumpster
Feb 24 2019,negative,jokes are not funny money badly spent rampant sexism from the four old ladies
Feb 24 2019,negative,why was this movie made
Feb 24 2019,negative,have no words about how bad this was ghostbusters what are you doing to us
Feb 24 2019,negative,wish it was just kriten wiig
Feb 23 2019,negative,the actresses were the only high point of this movie  the entire picture was almost wholly derivative and lacking in any real originality going out of its way to reference the original as much as possible to its detriment  the result comes across as a parody of the franchise instead of a film able to stand on its own two feet  the script was subpar at best the plot was lazy and the cg didnt stand up to the task it was put to
Feb 23 2019,negative,unfunny subpar acting painful to look at special effects and a garbage script i wish i could get that time back
Feb 23 2019,negative,what a waste of time
Feb 23 2019,negative,this movie is trash saw it and was thoroughly disgusted
Feb 22 2019,negative,this movie is the biggest piece of garbage ever what an insult to the original the movie is actually appalling its not funny at all worst movie of 2016 and one of the worst ever
Feb 21 2019,negative,the critics got this one way wrong as far as remakes go this will go down as one of the worst it failed at being entertaining at capturing the spirit of the originals and pretty much everything else too
Feb 21 2019,negative,12 a star because zero wasnï 12tmt an option
Feb 21 2019,negative,pathetic attempt at a reboot women just are not funny
Feb 21 2019,negative,what a dumpster fireget wokego broke
Feb 21 2019,negative,what is this mess finally watched it and all i was thinking was how can this classic beloved franchise allow such a monstrosity do not watch this unfunny nonentertaining dull stupid train wreck
Feb 20 2019,negative,they butchered the original movie
Feb 20 2019,negative,insulting to menkind
Feb 20 2019,positive,its a good family movie
Feb 20 2019,negative,one of the worst movies ever
Feb 19 2019,negative,one of the worst movies i have ever seen
Feb 19 2019,negative,this movie and the way movie critics dared to give it good reviews just because of the sjw liberal media pressured them made me never look at another critic review again total garbage of a movie
Feb 19 2019,negative,i wanted to like this movie  but it isnt funny or entertaining  it really has no redeeming qualities  what were they thinking
Feb 18 2019,negative,this was truly terrible
Feb 17 2019,negative,an insult to the ghostbusters franchise
Feb 17 2019,positive,i did enjoy this film i dont it deserved all the hate
Feb 17 2019,positive,i have rewatched this movie many times since it came out and i tear up almost every single time holtzman takes to the final battlefield ive been a fan of ghostbusters my entire life and its incredibly rewarding to see characters i can relate to im also a huge fan of paul feig its clear how much he loves the original  every single cast member is hysterically funny i literally do not understand how some people claim that this movie is not fantastic
Feb 16 2019,positive,this movie was original amazingly funny and creative the bad rap comes from people who wave their opinions around without seeing this movie watch it love it im sad there will not be a sequel to this one 
Feb 16 2019,negative,the ghost effects were cool and chris hemworth was kind of funny everything else yuck
Feb 15 2019,negative,this movie is awful they made all the males in this film dumb the jokes were so bad that i had to take a break from watching this film i really didnt want to finish the movie but i did this movie doesnt make any sense and the plot is terrible and made no sense     a reboot of the franchise was not a smart way to get this movie out they should of made a passing of the torch of the original team to a new generation and i dont care if its a female or male team or even a mix as longest its good the sex of the characters didnt cross my mind i am fan of the cast and love their other movies and tv shows they could of made a portion of the cast either family members of the old team or colleagues in similar fields of science tech etc also with that idea you could of made the film about the original ghostbusters quitting after the loss of egon spengler due to some sort of accident regarding a ghost related incident these are just some ideas better then this damn film without insulting the audiences intelligence or even a group of people and while leaving out the crude jokes which failed to make in impact on the audience over all this film was terrible and only should be watched for how not to do a reboot of a franchise
Feb 14 2019,negative,corny story   lousy acting   lame villain build up   slow paced   comedy element even amateur comedy movies had better jokes in it
Feb 13 2019,negative,this movies main mission is to make people laugh believe me there is nothing funny about this movie i cant believe critics give this movie a 74 rating what a joke theyre either afraid to offend by giving an honest review or theyre social justice warriors
Feb 12 2019,positive,hits fantasy comedy like its predecessors ghostbusters is meant to be fun and for family with varying levels of comedic lines glad so many stars were willing to join the fun go ghostbusters go dan aykroyd go neat spin with all female cast rip harold ramis
Feb 12 2019,negative,the worst movie ever made
Feb 12 2019,negative,absolutely disgusting film made out of corporate greed and the need to shit on white men sexism works 2 ways people
Feb 11 2019,negative,this was the worst attempt at a reboot that ive ever seen not only should this never be shown again the creator should be forced to go around a beg forgiveness from society
Feb 11 2019,negative,id give it zero stars if i could
Feb 10 2019,positive,listen this isnt citizen kane but its a pleasant comedy with a talented cast  also a warning to any lesbians out there theres a scene near the end when kate mckinnon is fighting ghosts and she pulls out two guns in slow motion lets just say its surprisingly hot i was not expecting that
Feb 10 2019,positive,heresy it may be but i think its better than the original the cast is both better individually and as an ensemble and kate mckinnon walks away with the movie in an utterly madcap take where it fails is the lackluster performance by neil casey in the villian role i didnt care enough about him to dislike him this movie needed someone meatier and more likely to chew the scenery  what geoffrey rush or faye dunaway wasnt available
Feb 9 2019,positive,i really enjoyed this movie funny and fresh  almost didnt watch it because of poor reviews but its a delightful take on a classic  the original can stand on its own as does this remake family friendly
Feb 8 2019,negative,no humor just feminist propaganda and unlikable characters an insult to the franchise  get woke go broke
Feb 7 2019,positive,the jokes and comedic lines where great and the story was great especially with its twist in the end
Feb 3 2019,negative,yeah put strong independent women everywhere and then brag about it hipocrites
Feb 3 2019,negative,it was alright but when you make a movie in a series it needs to stand on its own this movie doesnt stand on its own as a ghostbusters movie its a mediocre comedy trying to cash in on both politics and the original movies nothing more
Feb 3 2019,positive,i think the problem with this movie is that it should have been aimed more at a younger audience yes its a funny ghost story for adults but the ghosts and effects in the movie look more like the ghosts from disney haunted mansion thats why i dont think this movie translates well to todays modern day movie goers in saying that i really didnt mind it but i did think it was a kids movie lol minus the adult themes
Feb 3 2019,positive,ghostbusters was an honourable attempt at rebooting the original 80s classic the dynamic of the four leads was an updated fresh version of their original male predecessors the talents of mccarthy wiig mckinnon and jones put their own twist and make the characters their own and the result is a film that pays great respects to the original to be more of an hommage than a rehash of what has already been seen before the special effects with typical hollywood fashion are overthetop but the props in the film is what i truly appreciate the new ecto1 car and proton weapons looked amazing the sets however look a little too clean to be believable as a real space and seem too obviously a movie set having four developed female leads busting ghosts is a great update to the ghostbusters universe but that leads me to my one major issue with the film the original ghostbusters had all four members scientists but in this updated version only three of the four are to make the black ghostbuster the only one that is not a scientist seems like the film is taking one step forward in the right direction for girl power but two steps backward in race relations all in all i very much look forward to the sequel with much more of the hilarious banter amongst the ghostbusters and hopefully they can ensure that the jones character take night classes to obtain a phd
Feb 2 2019,positive,really enjoyed this version thought it was fun and bubbly
Feb 1 2019,negative,was looking forward to this classic reboot but fell a sleep half way through and im ok with that
Jan 31 2019,negative,was a terrible movie plot was bad acting was terrible
Jan 31 2019,negative,it was an incredible shame that a movie with such talented actresses could wind up being so joyless
Jan 30 2019,negative,i had to be under the influence to be able to sit through this hot mess of sexism bad acting shit story tellingwriting and endless rip offs from the original     this was awful i hated the way they treated the original secretary but it was so much worse in this one so so much worse it was emphasized several times the only reason kevin was around was because he was pretty the endless allusions to white men being evil was inescapable the constant references to penises being mens weaknesses were terrible men do also do not talk about what women wear that was a trend right off the bat this whole train of humor was cringe worthy to say the least     the open lesbian sexual tension was awkward and cringe worthy     the boss fight was well choreographed the props were good cgi was good the rest just made me want to stab myself repeatedly with a dull spoon     so glad i watched this train wreck for free off the internet
Jan 30 2019,negative,worst movie ever i hate the forced feminism and became so political
Jan 29 2019,negative,saw it and hated it i am a woman and i grew up with this series it disgusts me that this movie is even wearing the name ghostbusters if i could give less than a 1 star rating i would do so
Jan 29 2019,negative,as i always say dont make whats old new as many movies and tv shows have possed in this new century is that there is never original movie work just reproductions of timeless classics that can never be made again i also was disappointed at the idea of why are they making a movie on ghostbusters with the original themes and stories just with a different gender of cast members its beyond me why the director screenwriter or producer could have done a movie on before they were the ghostbusters or fans of the ghostbusters who try to be in their image
Jan 29 2019,negative,this is how you ruin a franchise a clear example is this movie
Jan 29 2019,negative,biggest pile of shit for a movie i have ever seen since batman  robin in 1997 this movie is a slap in the face to the fans of the original two no i am not being hateful that it because only women was cast far from it its the stupid story and ignoring the original like it never existedwell this 2016 reboot is a movie that nobody wants existing talk about irony as for the critics they must have been sniffing too much ectoplasm to actually think this movie is even remotely good when its a big steaming pile of dogshit
Jan 29 2019,negative,the joke was not funny at all i was thinking maybe this remake would be good but the jokes was not funny i was in the theater when this movie came out and i did not hear anyone laughing
Jan 28 2019,positive,one of my best movies i like to watch i have seen it 6 times already i really recommend it to others
Jan 28 2019,positive,better than it looked from the trailer and definitely not deserving of the hate it gets  a lot of the comedy was lost on me but i enjoyed the ride unfortunately for a film that tried to challenge the ridiculous notion that women arent funny hemsworth was far and away the best part of the movie for me
Jan 28 2019,negative,let me quote the movie directly from this movie sad bored lonely sad women    gimmicks gadgets and tons of cg cant fix bad writing it just wasnt that funny plus and lets be honest the feminist push in this movie making all the men ignorant and jerks made this movie into a sad statementand i honestly think that was the intention all along    this was a greedy cashgrab that really didnt live up to the hype and im actually in agreement that the 3rd real ghost busters movie is coming out    it just didnt live up to the lineage of previous movies and honestly after hearing leslie jones spew venom at the possible upcoming gb3 i liked this movie even less
Jan 27 2019,positive,it may not hold as big a candle to the first movie but ghostbusters answer the call is still a good though not great reboot my only nitpicks are that some jokes go on for 50 years kevin is way too bumbling and rowan is an inferior villain to gozer or vigo     other than that i enjoyed it as a guilty pleasure
Jan 27 2019,positive,screw all the people criticizing this it was hilarious  the cast was amazing
Jan 27 2019,negative,yeah this is bad why  do i hate women  no  i like the gilmore girls and thatâtms pretty much a female driven cast the reason people myself included donâtmt like this film is simple  itâtms not funny 
Jan 26 2019,negative,this is one i gave a fair chance going in i wiped all of the negativity that had swooped in from the internet and judged the film on its own i couldnt help but be bored for alot of the film i thought it began alright besides a few jokes that made me want to dig my brain out with a fork the middle is just all setup and not much goes on the climax is a little bit of action cgi fun for about 10 mins but kind of overstays its welcome i dont think you have bad taste if you enjoy this one im glad you were able too unfortunately i didnt like it very much
Jan 26 2019,negative,this film is nothing short of an insult not to the ghostbusters franchise but to the very message it was trying to deliver    feminism is fine but hamming and shoehorning it into a film as a means of a marketable ad is nothing short of revolting it belittles the actual issues and turns them into the same jokes that trolls have been making    the comedy is nothing but everyone acting like complete imbeciles not even a shred of dry sarcastic humor that the original had a good example of a female empowering series set in new york city with dry sarcastic humor is russian doll the reason why that was empowering is because it only brought it up in subtlety this film lacks even the word subtle     short version not funny exploitative to people who care about the issues it tries to talk about trash
Jan 26 2019,negative,what have they done to the movie they have spoiled our childhood just for a political agenda shame on you democratsi did not think that you guys could stoop so low
Jan 26 2019,negative,completely worthless waste of time and money seeing
Jan 26 2019,positive,my kids and i really enjoyed this movie its hilarious with nonstop nonsense
Jan 26 2019,negative,no one deserved this bad jokes plain characters
Jan 26 2019,negative,i wish they had negative stars
Jan 26 2019,positive,this movie is still one of my alltime favorites love the power behind the gender swap out plus its hilarious
Jan 25 2019,positive,amazing movie and incredibly fun my whole family watches it together even past halloween and cant get enough of the balance of humor adventure and fun
Jan 25 2019,negative,one of the worst movies i have ever seen
Jan 24 2019,negative,this film lacks a solid platform to build on its neither scary funny thrilling interesting etc had it perhaps focused on being a comedy strictly for adults or a horror atleast it could have a clear genre to slip into this is just fractions of the above mentioned and it leaves the film lacking in everything a few chuckles provided at the beginning wear off after 30 minutes with no real gut busting laughter melissa mccarthy plays herself leslie jones was given a frustrating stereotypical role shes better than that and deserved more chris hemsworth couldnt even play dumb this is a poor movie i havent seen the originals so i couldnt care less about the cast this movie is simply poor
Jan 24 2019,negative,you just had one job sony and you blow it this movie si so bad that not even a great cast couldnt save it
Jan 24 2019,negative,so so bad cringeworthy adlib does not a ghostbusers script make
Jan 23 2019,negative,quite possibly the most sexist movie i have ever seen the movie portrays men in general as the the main antagonist while also throwing jabs at academia and the sciences the occasional references towards particle physics tries to hide the fact that this is a propaganda film i like melissa mccarthy but she is drowned in the ensemble the cameos from the living members of the original cast were pleasant the producers of this movie were fired justly
Jan 23 2019,negative,pathetic excuse of a movie i like some of the cast and thats it sjw agenda and all this empowering fails hard dont borrow beloved franchises if youre not gonna pay respect to it
Jan 23 2019,negative,i would have loved to see a return to this franchise but alas thatâtms not what this movie is another ârebootâ with cheap jokes that are crude at best the all female leads were an attempt in luring ini have no clue but itâtms obvious they wanted three females regardless of anything else ghostbusters 2 sucked bad enough but this movie was twice as badcontemplates asking for my money back
Jan 23 2019,negative,just an all around bad movie
Jan 23 2019,negative,i didnt like it because it was push at me a lefty a gender
Jan 23 2019,negative,im glad this film is being put to rest bring on ghostbusters 3 how about film makers stop trying to virtue signal  instead just give loyal fans of franchises what they want if they do want to create something new maybe they should try being creative  come up with some completely new ideas instead of coopting something fans have grown to love get woke go broke 
Jan 22 2019,negative,another film that puts political agenda over story wait for the real one to come out in 2020
Jan 22 2019,negative,without comparing to the original this film is forgettable and despite the cast that i expected to make me laugh yawn
Jan 22 2019,negative,a poorly written and executed reboot of an iconic film franchise
Jan 22 2019,positive,fun thatï 12 12tms all i asked for and i got it really well
Jan 22 2019,negative,this was a horrible movie on every level i suggest you pretend this was never made and start the franchise off connected to the originals 
Jan 22 2019,negative,two thumbs way down
Jan 22 2019,negative,there was no reason to make this movie i coulld not even get through it
Jan 22 2019,negative,the movie is simply not funny
Jan 22 2019,negative,boring lost interest in this movie  nothing fresh about this  sad thing is i really like most of these actresses but they couldnt save this horribly inane and uninteresting take on the ghostbuster franchise
Jan 22 2019,negative,terrible i stopped the movie so disappointing because i love the actresses
Jan 22 2019,negative,this was a terrible movie the attempts at comedy were flat and to be honest outright pathetic and that wanton joke was dead on arrival yet it was constantly repeated and then we have the male character i forget his name who is so dumb i am surprised he remembers to breathe i have seen simpsons characters with more intelligence  and the crotch shot at the end to defeat the villain i find that really juvenile and unfunny the original was more mature and enjoyable in every sense even though it was a kids movie
Jan 22 2019,negative,it was ok they did fine
Jan 21 2019,negative,worst movie i have ever seen and an insult to the franchise 
Jan 21 2019,negative,terrible movie really ruined the series plot is non existent characters are not engaging or interesting in general a waste of money
Jan 21 2019,negative,poor reboot not entertaining like the original waste of time dont bother
Jan 21 2019,negative,who this was really bad did they have a script or did the adlib the whole thing
Jan 21 2019,positive,funny different to originals good to watch several times
Jan 21 2019,negative,if it ainï 12 12tmt broke donï 12 12tmt fix it every attempt at humor in this remake fell flat with barely any exceptions as a woman i was hoping that this movie would be a good alternate ghostbusters but it ended up as a poor attempt at inserting ï 12 12feminismï 12 12ï 12â into a movie that was 100 better without it
Jan 21 2019,negative,the original movies are classics this version is nowhere near as good as the other movies
Jan 21 2019,negative,just a dumpsterfire of junk poor acting forced jokes feminazi propaganda also the biggest measure as to why this movie was a failure  failed to at least recoup the cost of production by definition  that makes this movie a failure box office tickets sold is what makes a block buster not sjw drivel
Jan 21 2019,negative,was kinda what i expected it to be so at least i wasnt disappointed
Jan 21 2019,negative,i will give this movie a little credit because i love the ghostbusters franchise from movies cartoons to toys but the writters tried to reboot a 5star classic without truly following any of its formula   this would have been an awesome movie if it was in the same universe with the first ghostbusters passing their business on to these characters there was no flow of story and the villain kept changing lastly instead of having different character mostly everybody seems to be the peter venkman funny one
Jan 21 2019,negative,terrible a scourge on humanity
Jan 21 2019,positive,extended version with 17 mins add is much better than theatrical you get to know the cast better and the jokes are better done if they released this at the start it would of been better recieved
Jan 21 2019,negative,the funniest parts in the movie were ironically the parts with kevin which were blatantly sexist and there is no attempted balancewhich in itself shouldnt bother anyone outright the original had some of this however the fact that all the actresses did interviews denouncing sexism just makes it hypocritical and weird furthermore none of it felt like it was in fun spirits but highly spiteful the villain is not fully fleshed out the supernatural lacks mystery and where the humour in the original felt like something one might actually run into in real life like the office or parks and rec none of these characters personalities felt real it is really important to ground the characters in a film that is already flirting with the suspension of disbelief this is why the snide and pithy remarks of venkman in the original were so great honestly i blame the script mostly melissa mccarthy and kristin wiig have already pulled this off in bridesmaids so i was hoping for more
Jan 20 2019,negative,if they hadnt fabricated an excuse for outrage no one would have bothered with this movie and they knew it thankfully not enough folks bothered anyway
Jan 20 2019,negative,this movie is bad no matter if it is uncool to say so because it happens to have an all ladies main cast they had the talent to make a good movie but somehow the chemistry between the main cast was absent comparing this movie with the original 1984 ghostbusters is like comparing atlantic city woth las vegas
Jan 20 2019,negative,not really that funny and not really anything like the first movies in the series
Jan 20 2019,negative,i loved the originals so much great humor campy at times and a great story this version is just bad bad acting and not very funny however i did like a scene where holtzmann goes at it with the double guns for me that one scene was the best part of the film
Jan 20 2019,positive,very silly and fun reboot that modified the original theme with fresh characters and personality
Jan 20 2019,negative,not worth wasting your time with
Jan 20 2019,negative,it was just a political stunt dressed up  this in turn created a very poor movie that trys to cause diversion in real life  why arent movies movies any more why do they all have to be politically motivated rather than art why did the women involved not want to make their own movies ratger than riding the skirts of men that in itself seems counter feminist   i love the actors in the vast majority of movies that theyve been in but the amount of pc garbage that is in this movie ruins it you can tell its politically minded due to leslie jone btchy comments stating that the return of men is something akin to racist  sexist dictatorship  news flash it has women in it as well  in summary its very poorly scripted has plenty of sexist jokes contained not funny and not a movie that i would sit down and watch with my kids i tried to give the movie a try but it was rotten to the core
Jan 20 2019,negative,fell asleep twice and laughed almost once when she talked to the plant
Jan 20 2019,negative,this movie gets as much as much as one star from me thanks to chris hemsworths performance mike hat everything else in this movie was soul crushingly bad
Jan 20 2019,negative,another  sjw rebootrehash that does little to further the franchise but instead goes down hard on the original and makes every white man into either a bad guy or a parodical character
Jan 20 2019,negative,this movie sucks big time deleted from my movie list if i could give it a zero star i would but unfortunately half star is the lowest
Jan 20 2019,negative,a disappointing movie all the way around it doesnï 12tmt know if it wants to be a sequel a reboot or a reimagining it takes some of the best elements of the original film and misuses them itï 12tms almost as if the director didnï 12tmt understand or appreciate the franchise that he took over that left us with an extremely talented cast with no direction
Jan 20 2019,negative,humors sucks plot holes and women charactets doesnt fit very well with the story
Jan 20 2019,negative,terrible film not funny and at best it was a wannabe
Jan 20 2019,negative,be gracious that you are being replaced this reboot was just bad  excited for gb3
Jan 20 2019,negative,very poor writing not funny and only relates to the originals in name only
Jan 19 2019,negative,this movie was horrendous the characters werenï 12tmt representative of real people the cameos by the original cast were essentially pointless the plot intentionally insults the original franchise if i could give it a 0 i would
Jan 19 2019,negative,most of the acting was decent but it just wasnt a ghostbusters movie  it felt like something else  a real bummer because i wanted it to be good
Jan 19 2019,negative,boring got fed up 5 minutes in
Jan 19 2019,negative,very unfunny cast should not have even made this movie
Jan 19 2019,negative,this is pretty bad not even the quality cast can rescue this garbage movie this looks like a studio cash in that failed who is letting these scripts through the only slight shining light coming out of the trash can which is this movie is the comedian actresses manage to make a couple of the moments in this film funny but they can only work with the script they were given a friend of mine told not to bother watching this movie wish i had listened to her
Jan 19 2019,negative,awful movie donâtmt waste your time
Jan 19 2019,negative,trash no plot the villain is a joke and the characters are all trying to be like the peter character
Jan 19 2019,negative,unfunny uninspired unnecessary this should never have been made enough with the reboots
Jan 19 2019,negative,worst movie i have ever paid to see
Jan 19 2019,negative,the movie is ok but its kind of hateful towards men
Jan 19 2019,positive,despite the negative online reviews from ordinary people who allowed their emotions to cloud their judgement it was a great film i loved how a few of the original cast members were connected to the new characters how the story progressed and how it concluded acting was incredible and the film was hilarious 1010 would recommend
Jan 18 2019,negative,this movie doesnt deserve to have a fresh score on rt in fact it is a pretty bad remake that should be ranked way lower than the critics score and even the audience score gives it the score this movie got is why i dont take rotten tomatoes very seriously anymore like how can this be ranked above classics like forrest gump and home alone even the second ghostbusters which has a rotten score on here is much better than this poor excuse for a film and before you say it no im not sexist this film just fails as a reboot for the franchise the reviewers mustve been paid off to give it postive reviews deserves way more hate than it gets
Jan 18 2019,negative,humour was good enough and the actors tried their hardest  but whyjust why was it necessary to reboot this in a movie that was much worse than the original
Jan 18 2019,negative,finally got around to watching this film its basically a gillet commercial staring four wannabe amy schumer replicants attempting to tear down the patriarchy one classic film at a time     if i could rate it as less than 12 star i would utter rubbish
Jan 17 2019,negative,all this movie shows is that a studio can take the skin of something much loved hang it over the bare minimum of a script and then stuff it out with  product placement cameos that dont really make sense and embarrassingly clunky attempts at extended universe building the movie seemed to spend equal time waggling its eyebrows about the ghostbusters brand in a vain attempt to sell me the familiar and taking big postironic dumps on that same brand it felt like i was being made fun of for liking ghostbusters while at the same time being asked to contribute to the cost of making a ghostbusters movie this film was deeply lazy utterly transparent and a shameful waste of proven talent the comedic highlight was the queef joke that was great i really think that i wouldnt judge any other runofthemill popcorn flick as harshly but it was insisted that this film was important in that context and in the context of robbing the grave of a far superior movie i give this a lower score than i otherwise would sony you took something everyone loved and you were careless with it
Jan 17 2019,negative,just got around to seeing this reboot it was laughable and not in a good way
Jan 17 2019,negative,seen better quality school plays its not even enjoyably bad
Jan 16 2019,negative,dysfunational pc garbage and feminazis what do you expect living ina country with feminist being mainsteam promoting hate towards men 247 turning women into men and men into women broken country
Jan 16 2019,negative,basically they updated the special effects while at the same time downgrading the cast its obvious theyre trying but the problem is theyre not the ghostbusters theyre just au of ghostbusters that also suck
Jan 16 2019,positive,i was very disappointed that the storyline for this film was essentially the original first film i think maybe if theyd come up with a different storyline and less cheesy lines people wouldve enjoyed it more
Jan 16 2019,negative,where does one start a trend in comedy that sucks is adlibbing this show is one ad lib doesnt make sense and fall short on everything
Jan 16 2019,negative,comedy is subjective and this movie was subjectively awful
Jan 15 2019,negative,this movie tarnished the name of ghostbusters  all copies should be destroyed in hopes that it will help people forget this abomination
Jan 14 2019,negative,crappy sjw feminazi propaganda reboot of the original
Jan 11 2019,negative,a really really really boring piece pf boring shit
Jan 10 2019,negative,bad acting unfunny jokes and a nonsensical story just terrible
Jan 9 2019,negative,the jokes fall for the most falt  but some pretty good once every one and then
Jan 9 2019,positive,this was so underrated sony did a notoriously shitty job at marketing its nowhere near as preachy as youve heard there are some comedic heavyhitters who do so well together its genuinely sad we wont see this cast together again  at least for the franchise    the effects are well done managing to keep a similarly creepy but fun feel like the original the plot is a bit thin towards the end but there are enough laughs and spooks to keep you entertained throughout this really is an underappreciated gem if you havent seen it do it
Jan 7 2019,negative,has a few funny spots but thats about it  its a political correctness  version of the well made and fantastic original  it is an absolute joke of a movie just terrible   the only scene you need to see to tell you all about the movie is when the busters go to a concert and the other woman jump off the stage onto the croud to catch a ghost but then the black 6ft  women jumps everyone gets out of her way so she lands on the floor her response and i quote i dont know if its a black thing or a women thing but i am mad as hell its total bullshit its because she is a 300lbs 6 foot women jumping at you you dont want to get hurt it has nothing to do with what and who you are     basically a sjw propaganda piece   dont recommend it
Jan 6 2019,negative,what a waste ok here we go imagine this you bring back the original cast the ones you can theyre going through the motions before a kick ass threat comes along and well it kicks their ass they then realise they have to hand the baton over to their daughtersgranddaughters who have been in the background or even helping them out up until this point or the new characters have to go and save the old characters there you go im no writer but at least theres an actual reason to introduce these female characters and not doing it for the sake of doing it or as it really was some equality strong whamen bullst reason i mean that chris hemsworth character dear lord what an absolutely cringe inducing unfunny sexist mess he tries to answer a phone repeatedly thats behind the glass of a fish tank think i remember that correctly what the hell is that a joke its the kind of stupidity a child would come up with you know i cant even be bothered to write anymore so abysmal is this garbage this film has been criticised a lot not because the people criticising it are sexist or racist or whatever its because this film is a big pile of steaming turd  not sure the scores shown on here are mmmm real love the original film this is not even worthy of the name ghostbusters
Jan 6 2019,positive,its a decent film but i would love to see the original cast return although it had some funny references to the old ghostbusters but it could have been better it is still a typical ghostbuster comedy as always
Jan 6 2019,negative,one of the worst big budget movie ive seen in my entire film cringe unfunny movie trying to cash on sjw propaganda get woke go broke
Jan 5 2019,negative,i want so much to say i love this film owning the dvd i have watched it over 5 times and i will watch it more i keep forcing myself to love it and keep thinking im missing jokes somewhere in the end despite my love for every ghostbuster and their quirky personalities i just cant discover the passion for this film and that is the problem at the core i keep imagining paul feig behind the camera saying say something funny say something funny the end result is more skits than story i will keep returning to this film like a person returning to their abuser but i doubt my attempts to create love for the film will ever come to pass its just such a stale sexist and desperate attempt for a reboot
Jan 4 2019,negative,its disgusting what they did to ghost busters they took a beloved franchise and completely changed the genre and changed the intended audience to a completely different demographic i dont get the feeling the creators of this cared at all about the licence they where using and just wanted to use this movie as a massive virtue signalling spit in the face to the fans im so glad they are decanonising this movie and trying to make a real ghost busters movie however i dont know if i will even be able to enjoy it because of how betrayed we where by ghost busters 2016
Jan 4 2019,negative,i have no words such a bad movie
Jan 4 2019,negative,sexist desperate and full of blame to those who didnt like it its like a car crash you dont want to look at i keep trying to watch it over and over again because i am a ghostbusters fan i think im addicted to being abused im literally trying to force myself to like it after 2 years and 5 views its not sticking love the actress though there is just nothing there to be passionate about
Jan 4 2019,negative,this movie was to the original ghostbusters movie what macgruber was to macgyver namely a parody of the original the problem is that it was not marketed as a parody it was marketed as a reboot the original ghostbusters movie was unique funny had genius pacing with the jokes and had great believable characters the ghostbusters reboot had overthetop silly overdramatic acting that made the characters unbelievable and unrelatable the only really funny parts in this movie where the cameos by the original cast because they contained the same level of genius acting in delivery and timing of the jokes as in the original ghostbusters movies had this movie been marketed as a parody or the original i would have given it 35 for being what a parody should be but failing to be funny but marketed as a reboot of the original this is an insult to the original movie the original is still extremely funny and welldone  when i watch it today it has aged well  the reboot is like just an extended saturday night live sketch with a higher special effects budget but even with the special effects lookiing cartoonish and silly compared to the original movies effects which look way much better
Jan 3 2019,negative,all this movie proved is that all female casts can bomb a movie just like an all male cast can
Jan 3 2019,negative,i am a child of the 80s ghostbusters and back to the future were my favorite movies from that time i had been looking forward to a ghostbusters sequel for many many years when i heard there was going to be a new one i was filled with excitement when i saw it i felt like a child who had just been told that santa claus was not real just let tyler perry direct back to the future 4 and let leslie jones play martyerrrmarti that would be tyler perrys back to the future and it would somehow still gross 200 million because of several million waterhead
Jan 3 2019,negative,a pale ghost of the original not at all funny
Jan 3 2019,negative,horrible movie with cringeworthy comedy thats beneath the castâtms potential
Jan 3 2019,negative,everyone who took part in this movies should be ashamed of themselves i spit in your general direction
Jan 3 2019,negative,this movie is unbelievably horrible it makes an amy schumer stand up routine seem entertaining the level of comedy is for children 13 and under 
Jan 1 2019,negative,the worst thing ive ever seen in my live
Jan 1 2019,negative,seriously how did they mess up so badly    you had a successful franchise some great comedy and axting talent and modern graphics yet some how this movie was boring stupid with nothing to laugh at except the idea that people think this was great    what the hell happened
Jan 1 2019,negative,horrible i cant believe i actually wasted my time watching this
Dec 31 2018,positive,i am an avid lover of the original ghostbusters franchise and was initially wary of this reboot however i was proved so very wrong from the first 10 minutes almost every line of this movie is snappy and funny the movies pace is just right and never gets boring the cast is beyond stellar and i love the many homages to and cameos from the original movies  even the ghosts are similar     what i most appreciate is that they didnt try to replicate the original movies but instead created a new story with fantastic well fleshedout and relatable characters i must admit that chris hemsworth nearly stole every scene he was in i loved the camaraderie and development of the characters while i felt the storyline followed a similar direction to the original but with enough differences to know for sure that it is its own movie it is not a clone with genderbased changes but an addition to the fantastic franchise that ghostbusters is     i adore this movie and im hoping for a sequel
Dec 31 2018,negative,charmless vacuous lacklustre and pointless
Dec 31 2018,positive,a outstanding movie with unattractive special effects and a female cast
Dec 31 2018,negative,boring uninteresting remake with terrible performances all round
Dec 30 2018,positive,undervalued future classiccult film makes statements about gender and sex  funny in a nuanced way
Dec 30 2018,negative,i tried to watch this trash made it 5 min before i wanted to pick my eyes out could be one of the worst things not just movie ever made the literal cancer of films 
Dec 30 2018,neutral,the cst is good but unfortunately the movie is not very interesting and not funny there were so many call backs to the original that made me wish i was watching that the story was very boring and this movie didnt bring anything new other then having female leads the cast was good and a times were fun too watch but that is about it    5010
Dec 30 2018,negative,waste of talentmissed on so many levels
Dec 30 2018,negative,there are movies so bad theyre good  this is not one of them and on a second viewing it just seems even worse and more cringe worthy
Dec 29 2018,negative,wow just finished watching this movie the forced cameos were terrible this movie is filled with the lamest jokes i have ever seen
Dec 27 2018,positive,this was ok but most of the jokes didnt  land
Dec 24 2018,negative,i actually defended the malefemale switch when this movie was coming out  i finally got around to actually watching the movie  sadly it was a mess  not really all that funny i was really hoping for something better  it was only slightly better than the good slime vs bad slime of the second ghostbusters yeah that sucked too  ho hum  what a waste of great potential  to me the gender didnt matter  it just plain sucked
Dec 23 2018,negative,pc bullshit and so unfunny itâtms an embarrassment
Dec 19 2018,negative,unnecessary not funny failed to draw me in poor casting while at the same time trying too hard to overshadow its predecessor
Dec 18 2018,negative,this should not have been made they could have done so much better the director was going for saturday morning cartoon with this one ghostbusters should have been a horror with the ladies reacting to that world duh
Dec 18 2018,negative,why the original is a classic this was cringeworthy
Dec 17 2018,negative,i was a massive fan of the original and yes i know it has a few issues when watched after all this time but this new film is bad i didnt finish it  wow how to spoil a film with pc sjw rubish  terrible film
Dec 16 2018,positive,amazing hilarious perfect family comedy unfairly panned by critics
Dec 16 2018,negative,wow this is atrocious why did they even try to remake a classic it just keeps getting worse as the movie progresses 
Dec 15 2018,negative,awful script which is trying so hard to be edgy pc observational humour the plot is laughable a car wreck basically
Dec 15 2018,negative,who would write such an awful script who would act it and who would want to see this junk
Dec 15 2018,negative,you need to have an actual idea before you start writing a story female leads is not an idea its a detail you need more than that     paul feig grossly misunderstood the point of the original ghostbusters and it shows it wasnt just sticking a bunch of funny people together it was carefully selecting a cast who could work well off one another and telling an interesting story with them this movie does neither paul feig seems to be under the impression that the ghostbusters are supposed to be superheroes and while they might seem that way to some its only in the same way that a firefighter might be considered a superhero the ghostbusters are exterminators like cockroach exterminators if youve got a ghost problem call the ghostbusters and theyll handle it to the best of their ability thats the idea they arent supposed to be like the avengers having big epic superhero fights in the middle of an exploding city thats ridiculous paul feig doesnt know what the ghostbusters are and would rather insult anyone who points it out than own up to it
Dec 14 2018,negative,what a piece of shit
Dec 13 2018,negative,really disappointing
Dec 13 2018,negative,unfunny and embarrassing a wasted opportunity
Dec 12 2018,negative,dear god please dont let there be a sequel
Dec 11 2018,negative,lazy unfunny and annoying an absolute insult to the legacy of the original
Dec 11 2018,positive,no idea why this film i hated enjoyable and visually stunning ghostbusters is a well used attempt to revive the franchise whether the fans like it or not
Dec 9 2018,neutral,pointless remake of a classic 
Dec 7 2018,positive,i loved the editing the jokes and the acting
Dec 6 2018,positive,ghostbusters 2016 does not have the reason for the fans to have so much hatred but although it is very tacky and the references do not say that they came becoming as spilled excuse as a parallel universe of this franchise i admit the inconjunctive narrative arrangements and chosen cast that was one of the highlights of this film
Dec 4 2018,positive,i saw this in theatres and cheered through a lot of it my friend and i left almost in tears we were so happy it was amazing to see women on screen just being women who are heroes and wow  holtzmann i ended up cosplaying as her for halloween and at fan expo that year 
Dec 3 2018,negative,the worst movie of 2016 this is total garbage not funny not even as reboot
Dec 2 2018,positive,the only good ghostbuster film such a wonderful cast and brilliant special fx
Nov 27 2018,negative,not the worst ghostbusters incarnation that title goes to the slimer cartoon but definitely below the worst episodes of real ghostbusters the humor was not my style  the characters never stop talking over eachother the visuals  effects were good but i just cant get into the characters i dont know why they remade the original ghostbusters movie nearly shot for shot when they could have made a live adaptation of the already diverse cast of extreme ghostbusters which had a goth girl a guy in a wheelchair a latino an african american  the return of janine
Nov 24 2018,negative,didnt laugh except the parts when im not meant to
Nov 23 2018,negative,i didnt even like the original that much this dialogue is trash and the jokes are cringy it doesnt even deserve the effects that it was given when you have a budget that high actually make a good script
Nov 21 2018,negative,this movies is unbelievably badstupid storyhorrible characters and joke
Nov 21 2018,positive,not as bad as people say it is but not as good as ghostbusters 1 and 2
Nov 21 2018,negative,if the enjoyment of the original ghostbusters was the size of manhattan imagine it shrinking to the size of a twinkie with gb2016
Nov 18 2018,negative,worst thing in the world
Nov 18 2018,negative,wow this movie was a huge pile of shite awful inprov acting nonsensical plot disrespects the previous movies and their fans avoid this like the plague its that bad
Nov 17 2018,negative,loved the original theater released version but not enjoying the extended version too much garbage included
Nov 16 2018,negative,this is the film equivalent of a migraine the humour is lifeless and cringeworthy the performances simply fall flat and the story is stale the attempt to revitalise this franchise and prove that an allfemale cast can work didnt succeed though it had promise given the talent that is present there is nothing good about this film in the slightest
Nov 16 2018,negative,holtzmann was the only ok thing in the whole movie
Nov 16 2018,negative,failed on so many levels being funny is just one of them
Nov 15 2018,negative,whilst im all for cinematic female leading roles and heroes a film that explicitly promotes misandry the denigration of males where every male character is either moronic or evil whilst the allfemale team inevitably save the day is clearly driven more by a political message as oppose to the original fun fantasy romp that the franchise offered avoid
Nov 14 2018,negative,the humor was subpar total yawnfest
Nov 9 2018,negative,somethings should be left well alone when thinking about reboots the best person in this is chris hemsworth and the best moments the fleeting glimpses of the originals
Nov 9 2018,negative,so so so bad  omg do not waste your time
Nov 5 2018,positive,great addition to the series
Nov 4 2018,negative,horrible moviewhy did i think it would be different
Nov 4 2018,negative,seriously another franchise spoiled by feminism
Nov 2 2018,negative,the ad libs seemed funny at the time but on re watching they are all performed with the same deadpan monotone delivery and are largely forgettable  unfortunately the rest of the film is also forgettable  its a shame really as this cast could have been good had they been given better material
Nov 1 2018,negative,my wife put this on to watch as a halloween treat for me after 35 minutes we both agreed to give up on it it was both derivative and amateurish to an extreme degree i dont doubt that ill be embarassed when i donate it to one of the local charity shops
Oct 31 2018,negative,the 2016 movie feels like a parody of the original a two hour saturday night live sketch back in 2007 there was a ninety minute fan film called return of the ghostbusters which also followed a band of new recruits if my memory is correct it was set in denver and had similar directing and story beats to paul feigs movie but that was a fan film and could be considered great to a point i shouldnt have to compare a multimillion dollar movie to something fans did for a quarter of a million almost ten years ago this is a movie without logic it does want it wants just because without any thought as to what really worked in the original this is a movie where members of an audience seem happier to use a selfie stick to snap ghosts than run away from them this a movie where the villain uses the time travel of a portal to alter new york so it looks older why i have no idea the idea to disconnect from fans may of seemed like the obvious choice in that it brings in new fans however when you have a property thats almost adored as much as star wars it may not be wise to go after just that other audience what fans wanted and what would have made sense was a third movie that passed the baton onto a new set of recruits this isnt the gb movie we got and to misquote a certain batman its not the movie the fans deserved either what youre left with is a movie that offends fans and is only likely to appeal to either paul feig fans or small children who never grew up with the originals before this film was released like many i wanted this movie to fail for the reasons mentioned in this review however having seen the new movie the anger i felt has turned to pity for everyone involved as well as the kids who grow up with this movie clearly everyone was trying too hard it must be said but like the 90s animated series by design it was destined to fail and thats worse than hating a film outright because its bad i cant totally hate the finished product because it desperately wants to be liked the film would have been ok if it had been a spinoff movie but to bring back a semidormant franchise with this movie is a massive waste of time and money for selfindulgent political views that have nothing to do with the films story good intentions without suitable reasoning because at the end of the day why did it have to be ghostbusters at least i can wrap up by saying the 90s animated series is no longer the worst thing to come out of the franchise faint praise i know i never got to see an actual ghostbusters movie in the cinema and it seems my childhood dream of doing so will have to wait a stumble but hopefully one day the franchise will walk again thats what being a ghostbusters fan is all about
Oct 30 2018,negative,it wasnt good  as a big fan of the original and the cartoons i really wanted to but the humor fell flat for me  the graphics were very well done and i feel as though the actresses did their best with what they were given but the script just felt like a mess  i didnt get any laughs out of it but the poop and fart slapstick with a lot of cringe wasnt really what i was expecting from a ghost busters franchise  i liked the concepts for different ghost busting weaponry though  i was also pretty surprised at the onscreen suicide it was really confusing to see a character kill them self in a situation where i really felt like the humor was built towards smaller kids
Oct 29 2018,negative,shitty feminist movie
Oct 28 2018,positive,i hate how poorly this movie did in the theater i will never not rewatch it the cast was amazing and the story was fantastic it always makes me laugh
Oct 27 2018,positive,i have a question here it goes why do people hate this movie so much i love it i think the characters are lovable especially chris hemsworth as kevin the jokes range from a slight giggle to laughing out loud and the story is pretty easy to follow the only nit picks i have about the movie is that maybe they could of been more creative with design on the ghosts but other than that i love it maybe almost as much as the original
Oct 24 2018,negative,ugh this is one of the most unnecessary remakes ive ever watched its not even a good one
Oct 23 2018,positive,lets be honest the first ghostbusters movie was legendary  to follow up a movie like that is nearly impossible but i think sony took a bold step reigniting the franchise with a twist  the actresses were great but the editing and directing left some to be desired
Oct 22 2018,negative,finally gave in and watched it at a friends house a whole bucket full of nope it had some amusing scenes but it wasnt worthy of the ghost busters title
Oct 21 2018,neutral,the film is ok but replacing the original stay puft just why the 1984 one was better yes the original actors did die and some were still alive but it would be better if they stayed at the part where they left off i mean they have no story line to what happened to them like they could of said something like they retired so we applied or something ruined the whole franchise
Oct 20 2018,negative,poor and unconvincing acting something of an insult to the original films
Oct 18 2018,negative,just terrible sony you deserve the flop that this movie was
Oct 18 2018,negative,a tragedy of a movie that spits in the face of the original
Oct 12 2018,positive,saw this a while back thought it was good
Oct 12 2018,positive,meh its good actually
Oct 12 2018,negative,poor movie with a mediocre cast the jokes were not funny the first time and got worse as they repeated
Oct 11 2018,negative,horrible movie they shouldve just left this alone pathetic attempt movie had horrible writing and a better director   i love melissa mccarthy and thought i could watch her in anything guess i was wrong dont waste your time watch the one in the 80s instead i watched the 80s one after watching this one and it still holds up dont waste your time and money
Oct 10 2018,positive,the original was trashy admit it this one at least felt refreshing and didnt rely on a romantic subplot to further the story
Oct 9 2018,negative,terrible spinoff and absolutely disgusting and super feminist what a dosgrace
Oct 5 2018,negative,unfunny forced and dialed in movie with a talented cast but no control or direction
Oct 3 2018,negative,hemsworth was the funniest woman in it
Oct 2 2018,negative,unfunny forced and congested movie with a talented cast but no control or direction
Sep 29 2018,positive,funny as hell love this remake more than i thought i would and casting chris hemsworth was definitely a great choice 
Sep 29 2018,positive,love this one more then original one i hope they make a sequel
Sep 26 2018,positive,this ghostbusters reboot commendably avoids attempting to recreate classic sequences from the original but opts for distracting cameos overlong scenes of hitandmiss comedy improv and action sequences of our heroines shooting at ghosts in a sea of green cgi soup if it wasnt going to successfully create some iconic moments of its own then what was the point
Sep 24 2018,negative,in the 80s ghostbusters used to tinkle piano keys to annoy ghosts now we just make them watch this dumpster fire
Sep 22 2018,positive,there is a lot of angst about this movie the current imdb rating is 53 and i understand the die hard fans of the original being upset by the very premise as a movie though its ok its not bad especially the first half when the group is getting together its pretty entertaining i do think it goes off the rails a bit toward the end but its harmless
Sep 21 2018,negative,positives some parts are funny if you turn off your brain i liked how their technology improved over time even if it was incredibly fast its admirable that they had a goal of making science cool even though it felt like an insult to my science degree finally they did point out several errors in the originals showing that even those werent perfect
Sep 17 2018,positive,not bad but not great the special effects carry the film
Sep 16 2018,positive,being a fan of the first two films i wasnt sure what i was going to think of this new instalment i can conclude that it was a fun  creative ride great job for the entire cast  crew on keeping this franchise alive
Sep 15 2018,negative,horrible movie full of plot holes no story arc not funny at all a disgrace to the originals
Sep 15 2018,positive,this is the only movie review ive ever written  i went into it with pretty low expectations because it was a reboot but i was pleasantly surprised  i really enjoyed this movie and im grateful to the cast and crew as well as the writers for all their efforts  it was very empowering to see an almost all female cast and i thought they did a wonderful job
Sep 15 2018,neutral,didnt make any sense leslie jones and chris hemsworth added  some much needed distraction to an otherwise incohesive mess felt like it was trying too hard to live you to the original
Sep 14 2018,negative,this was so so terrible   fxs look like a bad video game and thats the best thing i can say about it  the actors all tried their best but the script and characters they were playing were so badly written it ruins all their efforts
Sep 13 2018,negative,it was on fx the cgi is poor the comedy is boring and only one of the actresses can act it was also more like a scooby doo film has no quality like the original
Sep 11 2018,negative,not an overly terrible movie had some fine moments but it still kinda is
Sep 10 2018,positive,i really enjoyed this as a movie in its own right this is good the only problem with this is that it is inferior to the original which was always going to be the case and it was a reboot of said original which really didnt need rebooting that aside the cast were great and the storyline was decent
Sep 8 2018,positive,meh there were some amusing moments they could have done more with the comedic aspects given the talent they assembled
Sep 3 2018,negative,this was a waste of my time and money
Sep 2 2018,negative,unfunny poor writing bad acting this movie is garbage
Sep 2 2018,neutral,the controversy on the film is pointless see it as what it is a reboot made for  dont be judgmental kids
Sep 1 2018,positive,ignore the hate a fun family friendly film that is worth watching
Aug 31 2018,negative,i dont understand the need to remake a funny classic movie in an unfunny way  there was almost no originality nor humor in this movie
Aug 29 2018,negative,absolutely dreadful film
Aug 28 2018,positive,hilarious cast mckinnon as holtzman was brilliant its a shame it received the amount of backlash it did
Aug 27 2018,negative,wth  man if they had just called it something different but to replace a male cast including the original writer akroyd who was also a star in it why do this
Aug 27 2018,negative,i gave it a shot but compared to the originals its cheesy filled with terrible cgi and doesnt respect the original instead making them out as if they were sexist it seems to want to target an all female audience but doesnt relate to women in any way  i found myself watching it thinking whats the point of this scene and how does it fit into the story other than to marginalise and ridicule men my only positive from the movie is its a reboot and not a sequel so doesnt ruin the canon of the originals my biggest disappointment was this prevented a potential hit from happening due to one directors determination to make feminism the central message of a family movie
Aug 27 2018,negative,it just couldnt time jokes and when it was funny they often ruined the joke within seconds with a bad joke i also felt that they had to many soup jokes
Aug 26 2018,negative,time you waste on something you hate is a waste of time
Aug 25 2018,positive,it was a good movie why does everyone hate it
Aug 20 2018,negative,unfunny forced like watching each actors most annoying snl character for 2 hours no chemistry no heart for a movie with ghostsit was pretty soulless
Aug 20 2018,negative,yet again another recycled script but with an all female cast i saw this at a friends house and still felt robbed
Aug 18 2018,negative,complete garbage there was nothing redeeming about this movie the casts acting was bland and consisted of humor that caters to the lowest denominator of viewers this movie is a shining example of social justice warriors defecating on already classic movies how this movie made almost 14 of a billion dollars in the box office is beyond me
Aug 18 2018,negative,good lord this was a goddamn abortion
Aug 18 2018,negative,a train wreck full of unfunny yet cringeworthy jokes the modern visual  cgi effects dont make up for an improvised clutter of broken dialogue and a misguided production so who am i gonna call the original ghostbusters
Aug 16 2018,negative,who you kidding this is a men bashing movie a total insult to the fans and original casts
Aug 16 2018,negative,the jokes fall flat to the point the film might as well be called something else most of the films humour is brilliantly delivered by kevin chris hemsworth the man who doesnt have glass in his glasses simply because he got sick and tired of cleaning the glass funny but still very cheesy     finesse movie reviews
Aug 14 2018,negative,mehhwell on average i would say chris hemsworth
Aug 14 2018,negative,a dumb and effortless reboot to a 1984 classic this one of those movies that was hated before release a wee more than emoji movie
Aug 14 2018,positive,not nearly as bad as people make out
Aug 12 2018,negative,not really that funny for a comedy
Aug 12 2018,negative,i was expecting better with such funny women involved chris hemsworth playing the dumb incompetent receptionist was the highlight for me
Aug 11 2018,neutral,a great talented cast put their efforts into a mediocre comedy that would already have been forgotten if it were unrelated to a wellknown franchise
Aug 11 2018,negative,ignore what people are saying the funniest ghostbusters ever  i must have watched a different movie  i have no problem with females being the leads sole actors or whatever it takes to break the glass ceiling  this movie was utter pap it  want funny it had no story and did the franchise a great disservice  the box office has spoken and a sequel is most definitely off the cards  if anybody truly thinks that this was the greatest ghostbusters movie ever please give the samaritans a call they have people trained to help you
Aug 11 2018,negative,this movie is beyond terrible in every single way including its stupid sexist remarks towards male viewers  010 bs avoid this movie at all costs
Aug 10 2018,positive,i enjoyed it dont see what is wrong with it
Aug 10 2018,negative,its a good job this isnt the original because a remake would never have been made its really not very funny and apart from the last fifteen minutes the special effects dont seem to be any better than the original despite the years that have passed
Aug 7 2018,negative,movie sucked giant hairy balls
Aug 7 2018,negative,it wasnt actually as terrible as some would have you believe as a standalone movie its average at best as a reimagining of the original its also average at best let me be clear this is not a sexism issue if the replacement cast were all men it would wouldve been just as poor        to be fair to the female cast they didnt do a bad job and they were all pretty good in their roles the main issue was the script was poor the only really amusing thing was having the hunky male secretary who had the brains of a housefly        the problem is youre going up against an absolute classic 80s comedy that is loved by millions could you a imagine a reimagining of back to the future or planes trains and automobiles it just wouldnt work cause the originals are so good its impossible to compete
Aug 5 2018,negative,thanks for ruining ghostbusters with unfunny women that cannot act and a terrible plot
Aug 5 2018,negative,one of the cringiest remakes i have ever seen
Aug 4 2018,positive,while it may have a good cast of actors and decent looking special effects there are a lot of obstacles for viewers to overcome if they really want to enjoy this soft reboot only some of the main characters are likable and the villain isnt developed well enough camerawork and music is okay but it only helps a little    for my full review of ghost busters 2016 check it out on this imdb link 
Aug 3 2018,negative,another film made purely to tick some boxes nobody else gives a  about
Aug 2 2018,negative,it opened well but it quickly turned into an unwatchable mess  this was not funny was not scary and it felt like it was written by a 5 year old  all of the leading women have made me laugh countless times with their other workbut this movie is just as bad for their legacy as it is for the legacy of ghostbusters
Aug 1 2018,negative,complete garbage not worth the media its imprinted on
Jul 30 2018,negative,this is not a reboot this is not a remake this is a very long feminist statement wrapped around the carcass of a beloved 80s franchise    as an experiment i think it was interesting to flip the characters but this movie even fails at that    the original janine for example cool aloof janine was replaced by a bumbling idiot    dr venkman is now ew i cant even go on at least they got right that 80s racist trope of the token black chostbuster being the only one without a college degree    this is on par with netflixs death note as the shittiest remake ever
Jul 29 2018,negative,not sure why this cult classic needed to be remade even the cameos of some of the original cast members and ghost did not improve this movie one bit cliched and clunky the girls do the best they can with the awfully puerile jokes chris hemsworth is wasted in this movie too and does nothing to advance the gender equality debate with him being cast as a himbo the original two movies had a much more sophisticated plot and was at least interesting perhaps presenting this as a followon from the original movies might have been a better idea shame on ivan reitman and dan akyroyd for being involved in this catastrophe
Jul 28 2018,negative,one of the worst films of all time their are literally no funny jokes and the characters are absolute piss and then throw in the garbage sjw politics and you in for one of the worst films ever
Jul 28 2018,neutral,melissa mccarthy is great kristen wiig is pretty good they other two make it a chore to watch hemsworths cheque must have be huge to do something this pointless
Jul 27 2018,positive,this was funnier than the original hands down hilarious
Jul 27 2018,positive,we loved this movie it is legitimately funny and because there is not inappropriate contact between ghost and buster you can watch it with your kids my son calls this movie the one that is actually funny the way they introduced leslie jones character is a bit clunky but i hope they reconsider the idea of a sequel if they can trim the budget the next onecould really be money
Jul 27 2018,negative,good lord was this terrible am i ever glad i waited for it to come to tv and am still thinking of asking my cable company for a refund
Jul 23 2018,negative,finally got around to watching this its legitimately bad the jokes are unfunny and go on way too long like they were mostly ad libbed by bad improvisers ironically the funniest lines and acting was by chris hemsworth his 10 minutes of screen time contained every laugh avoid it and watch the original or catch chris in ragnorok
Jul 23 2018,negative,im guessing the humour was ad libbed because you couldnt write comedy that bad thanks for ruining one of my favourite childhood films
Jul 23 2018,negative,74 are this guys for real this is one of the unffuniest movies ive ever seen
Jul 22 2018,positive,pretty damn good movie not sure why some people were crying about it
Jul 21 2018,negative,horrible just horrible 
Jul 21 2018,negative,couldve worked with different actors
Jul 20 2018,negative,this movie was very bad because women destroyed it
Jul 17 2018,neutral,the reboot to one of the greatest comedies of the 1980s does not fail because it has an all female main cast it doesnt deliver the punches and the script has quite a few weaknesses wiig is great hemsworth pretty funny and mckinnon wonderfully odd but mccarthy just doesnt have more to offer than the fat lady getting thrown around a lot trope there are short appearances by  the original cast and quite a few references to the old film without picking up its chronology another mistake the result is still fairly entertaining but actually could have worked despite of the naysayers just with a better script and maybe a different talent or two
Jul 17 2018,positive,ghostbusters has entered pop culture lexicon but i always found the film rather overrated maybe it is so because i saw this much lateronly recently but the premise left me uninterested and the jokes arent really all that all the actors are competent especially bill murray and harold ramis and sigourney weaver is always special but this is one overrated film with decent effects you be the judge in the endghostbusters is an okay comedy severely overrated
Jul 15 2018,negative,i was pretty sure i was going to dislike this film before id even seen it due to it being a cynical girl power effort that seems to be geared to the politically correct crowd and woe be tide any man who dares criticize it but all that aside what we have here is a needless retread of the original film with a pretty much identical plot but none of the charm or subtle humour that made the original so great the gags arent funny there are hardly any new ideas brought to the table and i think throughout the entire thing i laughed twice maybe even the special effects are not that much better than the original and considering the original is 34 years old thats saying something when director paul feig goes on a rant blasting the fans for not being able to accept females as the leads in a ghostbusters film when in fact most criticisms were levelled st the film being well a bit rubbish  i feel that says it all
Jul 13 2018,negative,the humor was not good the characters were not very good i find it boring remaking movies and changing the gender of the characters to milk money out of us
Jul 13 2018,negative,1 of the worst movies i have ever seen pretty sure this movie was writen by a 5 year old with some crayons
Jul 13 2018,negative,horrible remake do not make a sequel 
Jul 13 2018,negative,a poor remake indeed  save yourself some time and watch the original
Jul 12 2018,negative,possibly one of the worst movies ever made 0 laughs and just terrible
Jul 10 2018,positive,the movie is actually really fun and memorable if you dont go in taking it seriously the cast was a fun mix and it was a didnt require sexualizing women to be considered a good film like the previous ghostbusters a lot better without bill murry playing the selfish slighty bearable asshole who seeks out a vagina to move the plot along
Jul 9 2018,negative,wanted to give it a chance but it is super lame despite the all female cast jokes fall flat and the acting is horrendous at times 
Jul 9 2018,positive,its a decent movie but overall the movie is a bummer 
Jul 7 2018,negative,i didnt hate it because it was empowering for women i hated it because it was dull unfunny badly paced and a total snoozefest probably the worst reboot of alltime
Jul 7 2018,negative,wow tats what i call bad movie do yourself a favour and skip this one    you are warned
Jul 6 2018,negative,well it had ghosts and proton packs and well thats about it its just a poorly done soft reboot unfortunately the women are not funny at all which is sad ive seen better b movies
Jul 6 2018,negative,it doesnt matter if this is an allfemale reboot or notits either a good movie or its not and this is not a good movie flat jokes lame storytelling and a movie that just drags on with overthetop bad acting hated this
Jul 6 2018,negative,remarkably unfunny it pics up somewhat after the first hour but by then the mood is already dead flat uninspired dialogue decent fx though
Jul 5 2018,positive,the new femalelead ghostbusters gets off the a strong start with a great cast tonnes of laughs and mostly good visual effects however it stumbles in its thirdact ultimately revealing that simply swapping the genders of the originals main characters cannot inspire an entirely new film ultimately the positives outweigh its badlywritten and rushed ending resulting in an enjoyable experience as mentioned the cast is brilliant and armed with years of snl experience they easily pulloff the funnier scenes however the script doesnt give them much to work with and many characterconflicts are hastily resolved in favour of a grandfinale that was done much better in the original with mr stay puft overall there is plenty to enjoy for younger viewers and most of the film is likeable enough that said this feminist revamp seems largely irrelevant and an unjustified cashgrab  you mightaswell just watch the original
Jul 4 2018,neutral,if youve never seen the original ghostbusters this isnt necessarily a bad film it tends to rely heavily on cgi and has a lackluster sometimes unfunny script but it has its moments    however all this film is is a cash grab to say hey weve remade a cult classic only its got women in it instead who cares all this film tries to do is appease the sjws of the world dont get me wrong i have nothing against strong female protagonists who kick ass but when its done for the sole purpose of  a trying to get with the times  and  b to stir up controversy because that much is obvious  a needless souless remake is produced    i am in no way criticising the main cast for what they had they did a good job  what they were given to work with makes this a 2 hour waste of time for lovers of the original    in conclusion  mediocre but watchable for people who havent seen the original  waste of time for oldtime fans
Jul 3 2018,positive,hilarious  there will always be a soft spot in my heart for the original but this one was way funnier     heres hoping for ghostbusters 2
Jul 2 2018,negative,couldnt watch beyond the first 30 minutes it was painful idiotic script characters that just dont behave like humans and infantile shallow jokes that honestly didnt even make me smile how did this thing score so high by the critics either theyre blind havent watched the movie or got paid for a good review  worth noting doing an independent audience score calculation on all reviews in rotten tomato of any review of 35 stars and above shows only 23 liked it not 51 using tomatocalc
Jul 1 2018,negative,a flat remake that was doomed to fail for it would be in comparison to the original the movie felt like all four women were supposed to be the comedic relief but most jokes if not all fell flat while the dance sequence was meant to be a fun wacky thing it turned to be a terrible decision in an already terrible remake
Jun 29 2018,negative,just another oh look all girls cast
Jun 29 2018,positive,a perfectly watchable but not particularly memorable outing
Jun 29 2018,positive,i was expecting to hate this but it actually didnt annoy me the way that most hollywood fare does good characters too 
Jun 27 2018,positive,not perfect but a lot of fun and a lot of unnecessary hate for the film dont worry nerd bros the original ghostbusters still in fact exists shocking i know
Jun 27 2018,negative,first of all i want to clear that im in favour of intelligent strong female lead characters i love alien and aliens sigourney weaver the new tomb raider alicia vikander mcu and lucy scarlett johansson edge of tomorrow emily blunt thor ragnarok cate blanchett just to name the firsts movies that comes to my mind but this stupid sjws new trend of trying to remake old classics cult movies or just old movies with an allfemale cast is unbearable but the main point is not even about the allfemale cast the point is that theyre traying to do it making real awful stupid movies its just that simple if they do it with excellent stories and performances i support it but this its not the case at all the same as oceans 8 and the new star wars movies except rogue one which i loved and validates my point please enough is enough
Jun 27 2018,negative,its worst that  i expected
Jun 26 2018,negative,watched it on the airplane and wished i didnt  how can someone fail with such a strong franchise to carry the whole thing  the cast was honestly not funny  i hoped a lot they would be since the idea eas super interesting to switch genders from the real ghostbuster movie to this one much otential here  wasted 
Jun 25 2018,negative,not funny original or interesting just another hollywood hack reboot attempting to leech off the success of the original
Jun 24 2018,negative,the humor in the original was a bit more dark and just fit a ghost story with this remake its too much of a happygolucky musical
Jun 24 2018,positive,snl alumni and melissa mccarthy killed it in this one
Jun 22 2018,neutral,desperately unfunny female version of the 1984 stoner smash hit even the great melissa mccarthy cant salvage anything from the leaden script smug unoriginal just totally unamusing
Jun 22 2018,positive,the film holds its own and is an enjoyable watch reviewed much more bad press then it deserves
Jun 22 2018,negative,the fact this film is certified fresh is worrying to me because the film was everything but fresh im not a fan of these all women cast remakes just because they seem very forced and very gimmicky whatever happened to organic feeling female lead roles like sigourney weaver in the alien series or geena davis in the long kiss goodnight    from the start it was clear the humor wasnt going to be subtle witty or clever and that instead it would substituted this with over the top slapstick hahawementionedstarbuckshowrelevantbecausethatsarealthing humor that films seem to go for these days    the whole thing was very confused  the cast all seemed to be constantly vying for the funny one spot which just created this very 2d experience there was no variation in character the bad guy was completely forgettable and unintimidating the story was very meh the only thing that was funny was the fact that chris hemsworths character only managed to get the job as the ghosterbusters receptionist because they found him attractive can you imagine for one moment if it was the other way around alas its an all women cast so its empowering    id like to comment on the plot a little more but it was honestly that forgettable overall a waste of 2 hours and unfortunately i cant use that thing out of men in black to erase this from my memory
Jun 20 2018,positive,funny throughout but suffers from doing things for nostalgias sake the three main ghostbusters are great but the characters played by leslie jones and chris hemsworth are a little cringy still that doesnt spoil the movie it is funny and worth a watch
Jun 19 2018,neutral,its not that worst but its not that good either while the movie has some decent action okay performance and same thing for the visual effects but characters arent interesting the antagonist is forgettable and the comedy is mediocre 
Jun 19 2018,negative,had high hopes for this truly a disappointment 20 minutes in i was still waiting for my first laugh
Jun 18 2018,negative,every bit the disaster that the trailers foreshadowed
Jun 18 2018,negative,this was a steaming pile of chit
Jun 18 2018,negative,terrible couldnt finish watching it  terrible story acting and jokes if you could call them that
Jun 18 2018,negative,i signed up just to revie wthis movie how can it possibly have a rating of 74     i had seen the trailers when it cam out and thought they looked very poor so did nto see it at the nor did i rush to see it on netflix but my daughters boyfriend put it on    i had anticipated a mediocre  hoo hum movie but in fact it is far worse than that there is a complete absence of any chemistry between the main actors  a total lack of comic timing and shockingly poor dialog as an action comedy there is also an absence of any tension or excitement overall it fails to deliver laughs or excitement it would be very poor as an episode of a tv series i am not sure the actors can be criticised the scriptdirection is just awful    what is strange is how does it get deent critic ratings and what is going on with the ludicrously polarised audience score     bad very bad and any critic who gave it a strong rating shoudl be ashamed thsi is a movie that will not stand the test of time
Jun 17 2018,negative,decent concept horrifically executed  the characters have no chemistry and the jokes range from funny to sixyearolds to not funny to anyone  i honestly cant think of a worse movie that ive willingly watched
Jun 17 2018,negative,just watched on netflix and it has to be one of the worst big budget movies i have ever seen  it had a talented cast good special effects but a terrible script and i didnt even get one chuckle out of it  this movie sucks so bad
Jun 15 2018,negative,crap regardless of gender excuses  some movies should never be remade
Jun 15 2018,negative,worst special effects i have ever seen out of a big budget movie a reboot no less the original seriously had better effects
Jun 14 2018,negative,besides the controversy surrounding it the movie is a hallow representation of the franchise its missing the soul and heart of the originals   id also like to say for a movie driving home a women cast having the one black character be the street smart one was so messed up why couldnt she be a scientist why did it have to be a stereotyped black woman isnt that a little racist and counterintuitive
Jun 14 2018,negative,i keep forgetting that i actually saw this movie
Jun 14 2018,negative,another unnecessary remake of a classic what a waste of money to invest in making a movie worst remake i have seen
Jun 10 2018,negative,i did not like the brand new ghostbusters film it was a horrible movie it had a lot of weird and bad special effects i was not too impressed i love the original 2 the best but the newest one no way i am never watching this one again and it was a lot different from the original 2 movies
Jun 10 2018,negative,kristen wiig and chris hemsworth do the best they can with such a shoddy script and deliver somewhat amusing performances and kristen wiig was the perfect choice to lead a female ghostbusters film series but poor casting choices for other characters as well as paul feig directing with his typically juvenile and unfunny sense of humour the film turned into a car crash    melissa mccarthy is her usual annoying self and brings no charm to the role of abby yates kate mckinnon is obnoxious and unlikeable whilst the only purpose leslie jones serves is to be loud on top of this the villain is incredibly weak lacking any screen time to define his motives although this isnt helped by the fact that the films plot is paperthin the cgi is also pretty poor at times for a film from 2016 especially the big ghost at the end of the film    in the end it all just added up to be a rather lame attempt to needlessly reboot a much loved franchise that is painful to watch
Jun 9 2018,negative,there was no need to remake a classic and they did it in the worst possible way  this movie was complete trash
Jun 8 2018,negative,it seems like most lines were improved  its just not funny and there are plot holes to boot
Jun 8 2018,negative,why i cant put 0 stars
Jun 7 2018,negative,bad film and yet somehow reviewers enjoyed it but how
Jun 6 2018,negative,so boring the writing is awful the characters are annoying and the pacing makes me wanna die
Jun 5 2018,positive,not great but not bad ghostbusters is a fun and exciting movie with some funny jokes
Jun 3 2018,positive,this was a good movie  in a lot of ways it was like the original ghostbusters  its humor wasnt ha ha outright funny  it was witty and funny  i know this movie gets a lot of crap piled on it i wonder what would have happened if this movie was just called something other than ghostbusters   the female cast was talented and i found myself actually caring about these characters  i didnt feel like my childhood was ruined or whatever anyone thinks this movie did  i feel bad that a sequel will be unlikely as i think the cast had great chemistry  but i am glad i saw this movie  ive definitely seen worse reboots but even on its own ghostbusters was pretty good
Jun 2 2018,negative,so much sexism to men in the movie and unfunny character and flat jokes
Jun 2 2018,neutral,ghostbusters 54  quite boring   i expected ghostbusters to be somewhat funny and it honestly wasnt i felt bored and uninterested to even finish it   the structure is bland the jokes are horrible and the acting is ok   dont waste them time rotten   storywise and execution0935  acting 1325  camera work 1682  sound 152  overall 2695
May 29 2018,positive,what a funny movie original jokes very funny talented cast a lot of people critized this as a feminist atrocity but there is nothing in this that even hints at anything political let along identity politics with the advancement of cgi this was a great remake strong story line thay develops quickly and doesnt make you wait for action or comedy the only downside was how bad the rock band is in the scene while they catch their first ghost they could have cast a decent band and given them some useful publicity
May 29 2018,positive,each joke is mostly funny for a moment before being ruined by another joke the leads do a fine enough job and there are some really good original moments just barely gets a thumps up
May 27 2018,negative,had one or two funny moments but overall felt like a cash grab by the studio also why have the original ghostbusters in your film if you arent going to make them ghostbusters and jist treat them like shitheads all in all watch it once if you are interested but other than that its a pass
May 25 2018,positive,thumbs up all right now we have a new team that rocks i like this one compared to the older version because its not old fashioned its all new better cast graphics etc it was so funny and when i saw it i was laughing hard worth watching with family and friends before i forget dont be sexist please make a sql
May 23 2018,negative,this is the funniest movie i have ever seen and not in a good way dont let the idiotic feminist men and women tell you this is a good movie because its not its sexist unfunny and the supposed good parts arent good at all please dont waste your money on this garbage
May 23 2018,negative,what is this pos when did sjw become a thing i admit i was tempted  to buy the gb videogame and get this movie for free hahaha nope pass on that deal one of the best decisions ive ever made
May 21 2018,negative,sorry this was a pi very of garbage the script was horrible and the acting while not bad could have been better waste of time and money
May 20 2018,negative,a complete disaster a cheap explotation of a beloved franchise
May 20 2018,negative,every man in this movie is an idiot why
May 18 2018,negative,when i first saw it i thought it was just mediocre but having watched it again the seams really show on it its absolutely devoid of surprise or humour on a bare bones mechanical level the jokes are terrible and predictable girl egon was funny in a mugging the camera sort of way but the other chicks were insufferable 1 dimensional onthefreakingnose cut out jokling things the villain was as compelling as wet newspaper and it was just a mess an unloveable obnoxious mess devoid of heart or intelligence just thinking about it gives me a headache
May 18 2018,negative,an abysmal attempt at revitalising a franchise that didnt need rebooting lazily written with jokes so forced that they feel as if theyre shaking you and asking did you get that laugh its supposed to be funny  unfortunately i cant voice criticism without people thinking i have something against women i dont i just care if its done right
May 18 2018,positive,awesome i am a long time fan of ghostbusters this movie was very awesome for me i liked the cartoon the real ghostbusters and extreme ghostbusters better than the original movie and equal to the 2nd ghostbusters film the new movie put a lot of cool elements into the action and story  i was shocked to see so much backlash i wound up going to see it 5 different times in the theater i watch and love all of the movies this movie was better on the home release as it has a longer running time and some huge extra scenes i highly recommend it
May 17 2018,positive,horrible plot jokes and acting
May 16 2018,negative,the people who made this should be embarrassed even taken as a stand alone without the presence of the former ghostbusters this movie falls flat  the plot is poorly rigged together in a macgyveresque mess it somehow makes a movie but doesnt really make sense   the characters are flimsy and one dimensional and not at all believable as intelectuals or even capable scientists the special effects look more like some one puked some day glow paint across the concept art most of all and most sadly it wasnt funny the cardinal sin for a comedy and parroting another funnier movie  the lack of cohesive story and rampant actorsbeingletdowhatevertheydarnwellfeltlike is painfully apparent in the steamrolling of any actual comedy avoid this poorly acted weakly directed atrocity of a film
May 16 2018,negative,as it was predicted it goes better as a how not to do a film than the best comedy of 2016
May 15 2018,negative,stupid feminist reboot worst ghostbusters movie ever it deserves to have at least an 11 rt audience score     rating 0610
May 15 2018,negative,whoever is responsible for this awful movie should never be allowed anywhere near this franchise again it is not funny and the effects look like dragonball evolution the movie is a dishonor not just for the original ghostbusters but also for hollywood showing the level of stupidity that mankind reached since the original movie
May 13 2018,negative,now that the whole 2017 feminist trend has died down at last time a more honest review  in short this movie is an terrible  really bad acting on all fronts jokes fall completely flat and were cringe  seems like a bunch of grown ups trying to act like kids  theres sexism towards guys racist stereotyping and terrible cgi  this film stinks
May 12 2018,negative,this was so cringeworthy i had to switch off half way what a disaster
May 9 2018,negative,just awful how does this have a fresh rating
May 8 2018,negative,really did not like this movie at all if the original ghostbusters was a 5 star this remake  reboot whatever does not even measure anywhere near
May 7 2018,negative,it is not funny and painful to watch
May 6 2018,negative,adds nothing to the series by rebooting with a cheap gender swap trick poor script dusts off the original remaining actors to cameo not even as their famous 80s characters the dancing wanton jokes and all round forced humour are so on the damned nose paul feig has created a free roaming vapour which should not be seen by human eyes for the damage it may incur sony do not let that man anywhere near this franchise again
May 3 2018,negative,abyssmal replacing exquisite comic timing and relateably sardonic entrepreneurship of the original with poor technobabble and rambling improv the actors may be funny in their own media but jokes pushed for far too long do not cohere in a film it also manages the increasingly common bolshevick marketing sin of actually insulting women  minorities  etc if one applies ones brain they hire an obviously mentally deficient man out of lust for starters oh for a character with the quality of of janine melnitz
Apr 30 2018,positive,loved it its not trying to be the original film and paves its path with an awesome cast if youre watching it wanting to be a continuation of the original films dont bother you wont get any enjoyment out of it but if you go in with the expectation that it revolves around the concept of the original film with a new generation of funny people then youll love it
Apr 29 2018,positive,the name of the film is ghostbuster 3 directed by paul feig and written by feig and katie dippold  based on the script of the first film but where the genders of every protagonists are reversed  the film genre are comedy science fiction  fantasy the main characters are melissa mccarthy as abby yates  kristen wiig as erin gilbert kate mckinnan as jillian holtsmann leslie jones as patty tolan chris hemsworth as kevin  the main topic is the paranormal phenomena such as ghost  the place of action is manhattan new york  the film is about from old friend of the school abby yates and erin gilbert are authors of a research book on the existence of the paranormal phenomena such as ghost during their youth  some years later erin is professor at colombia university the visit of the curator of the museum of the mansion aldridge lead her to abby and jillian in a paranormal investigation whole they discover that someone create device broadening the activity paranormal their investigation lead him in the hotel mercado whose patty recognises the worker rowan north the latter commits suicide to caused the fourth apocalyspe whose he is the guide then in the form of kevin he enables her machine who free of their dimension the ghosts attack manhattan    the ghost are realistic and they are also to add the first ghost who existed the effect are amazingly impressive  generally i find this film highly entertaining  i recommend this film to anyone who love supernatural and science fiction
Apr 25 2018,negative,this film was utter horse shit
Apr 25 2018,positive,its no less corny than the original ghostbusters movie  i thought it was fun 
Apr 22 2018,positive,reboots and remakes are tricky do you remain faithful to the source material which then begs the question why remakereboot the film if its already been done gus van sants shotbyshot remake of psycho took  this notion to the extreme which i believe that was the point of van sants remake filmmakers rebootingremaking classics are left in unenviable either changing beloved iconic films which often offends fan sensibilities or remain slavishly loyal to the original source material leaving little reason for the remakereboots very existence the ghostbusters reboot tried to do something new and found the ire of many fans sadly a lot of those online fans turned out to be misogynistic trolls who hated this film simply because of its all female ghostbuster cast but thats a pretty ridiculous reason to hate on this film melissa mccarthy kristen wiig kate mckinnon and leslie jones are incredibly talented comedians and deserve enormous respect for carrying this film what i disappointed me about the the ghostbusters reboot was that the script was not all that funny and it also lacked the funhouse scares of the original you know where its actually scary in parts even though its a comedy i think this film also suffered because the audience already knew the origin story so watching the team figuring out how to use their proton packs and traps really didnt have the gee whiz fun of the original another element that made the original so fun was the great use of location shooting around new york city this reboot is also set in the big apple but doesnt make use of nyc nearly as well until the films climax in times square generally speaking this felt like a watered down version of the original not unlike an inferior tv series pilot for a tv show version of a popular movie but the film does have its pluses which primarily are the four leads solid special effects and fun cameos by the three of the original ghostbuster team murray akroyd and hudson harold ramos has sadly since passed away overall the likability of the cast and the strong production values make this worth watching even if the material if vastly inferior to the original
Apr 21 2018,negative,sacrilege hey feminist quit hijacking everything and come up with your sh
Apr 20 2018,negative,no one needed proof that you cant remake one of the most finely crafted comedies and one of the best films of all time by adlibbing in what seems like every single scene but here it is inexorable disrespectful lazy babbling devoid of any heart and charm
Apr 19 2018,negative,the original will always be the best
Apr 19 2018,positive,worth it for mentally challenged thor the big dummy makes the movie watchable there is also that one liner about the mayor from jaws otherwise it just gets a pass harmless and forgetable 
Apr 17 2018,neutral,so i saw the original one in the theater in 1984 and loved it this one was okay it had its moments spoilers belowthe cameos were unexpected and a great idea thats all i have to say about this movie did rick moranis have a cameo
Apr 17 2018,negative,another sony dumpster fire
Apr 12 2018,negative,just really cant get the type of humor used in the movie  there have been lots of bad adolescent male comedies in the past maybe trying to generate adolescent female response instead
Apr 10 2018,negative,abysmally painful to watch while the actresses are all talented and funny in their own right theyre complete fish out of water here i blame the writing honestly the jokes are so heavily telegraphed you can see them coming 10 miles away the original ghostbusters was witty and classy this was just silly low brow and flat out stupid id give it negative stars if i could
Apr 9 2018,positive,such a funny movie doesnt get old the cast are great
Apr 8 2018,negative,i finally saw the film  it was free on itunes so i didnt have to give them my money im glad i didnt    i counted my laughs and the film time  the count was 1 and it was a chuckle at 55 minutes 24 seconds  patty and abby were making fun of that guy from weeds and how they assumed he performed sexually  i didnt laugh or chuckle again    i know how the studios behaved about negative opinions about the film  i didnt like the film so obviously i am a woman hating basement dweller that was their marketing campaign i didnt like the film because it was poorly written schlock  two points in the movie stand out to me and they both happened in the last 30 minutes of the film  now the last 30 minutes of the film felt like the longest because it was the worst part of the film  the villain takes control of the army and makes them do a dance routine  this was the most offensively stupid scene in the film  why was this in the film  who thought that would be funny  it was so stupid that i was offended the film makers thought anyone would find that funny  the next scene that stood out was this slow motion scene where holtz pulled out two proton pistols and slung them around like they were whips in what i assumed was meant to showcase and action scene but completely felt out of place with the rest of the film    the villain was as one dimensional as an nes game villain  why is he evil who knows just because movie needs villain  the closest thing to an explanation to why he was evil was because people made fun of him  people made fun of him so he decided to break the astral plane and destroy all life on earth  yeah    ive seen some really bad films and this wasnt the worst but its up there  was this a comedy  who was this film made for  why wasnt the money put towards a script for an original idea  these are very talented actresses  i dont understand it  the only reason i would recommend this film is to satisfy morbid curiosity
Apr 7 2018,positive,disappointing some good reviews but not a lot of positive feedback via word of mouth plot was the main issue not the best writing dont know how the actors decided to sign on for this so many big names so utterly wasted would not recommend except maybe for kevin hes pretty funny
Apr 6 2018,positive,decent enough mostly due to mckinnon jones mccarthy its a reboot therefore it wont live up to the standards of the original 35 few chucklesno belly laughs
Apr 6 2018,negative,terrible movie i like how its okay to be purposely sexist to men as what a now its our turn statement
Apr 5 2018,negative,there were some funny parts but too many cringeworthy moments
Apr 4 2018,negative,just didnt add up for me  i love the original and this one just lacked that special something the original had
Mar 29 2018,negative,talent in the cast but not in the final product
Mar 28 2018,negative,forget all the men v women arguments does this film stand on its own two feet and is it any good answernope and its such a shame too i could give a long review but if you dont mind swearing and have a bit of time on your hands then look for  mr plinketts ghostbusters review he goes into a lot of detail and even reedits some of the scenes to make them much funnier showing you where they went wrong with their incessant talking shut up stop dancing
Mar 27 2018,negative,this movie is like a current marvel comic brought to the big screen if you are into comics you know how damning of a statement that is however i dont say it because of any sjw elements the whole premise of the movie obviously comes from a feminist place but i didnt feel any sjw or pc agendas being pushed here the allusion i make to marvel comics is that the movie characters feel like the feminine ones portrayed in those books intentionally gross childish goofy random and dumb girls who love sciencing aside from the youre sweating scene the movie is generally unfunny i love kristen wiig and find leslie jones to be hilarious when she views game of thrones in those videos i liked mccarthy in gilmore girls and have enjoyed her in some few movie roles yet none of their characters offered me any entertainment or laughs though i loved kristens hiphop dance moves i dont know why but i found myself really drawn to kate mckinnons character i just couldnt look away from her goofiness which is notable since she embodies the marvel comics criticism i mentioned this is a definite miss
Mar 25 2018,negative,the worst film of 2016
Mar 24 2018,positive,a very funny entertaining reboot of the original all the girls made me laugh out loud but kate mckinnon especially shines loads of laughs was really looking forward to a sequel but thanks to the haters who dont seem to be able to separate two different things that sadly wont be happening a must see especially for those who reviewed the film but never actually seen it
Mar 24 2018,negative,worst movie ive seen ist disrespectful to the original movie and dont derserve the name
Mar 24 2018,positive,honestly its not as bad as i heard like most of us i kept hearing people going on and on about how absolutely horrid it was and how it was not enough like the original moviestoo much like the original moviessomething something feminaziihavenosociallife    honestly i liked it i had a lot of fun with this one    for one the action scenes are a lot better than the 1980s film though in all fairness thats because we have a lot better technology these days and we can make them better    some of the nods to the originals were neat too slimer stealing the ecto1 and going joyriding was funny as hell the villain turning into a giant version of the ghostbusters symbol was a neat twist on the ending and the cameos by the original ghostbusters werent as dumb as people made them out to be at least to me    also dammit i liked the villain rowan had one major thing over shandor and vigo and its this hes relatable hes not some millionare architect who founded a doomsday cult hes not a carpathian monarchturnednecromancer hes some poor schlub who works a crappy job and got pushed around one too many times to the point where he snapped    speaking as someone whos worked retail most of their adult life i get where rowan is coming from a guy who had to put up with so much shit that he wants to burn the entire world just to give them the biggest middle finger possible thats not just a compelling villain thats me after having to work st patricks day hell hes even a smarter villain than them he possesses one of the ghostbusters and what does he do he immediately walks her body to where they keep the proton packs and takes a lead pipe to them if nothing else he actually treated the ghostbusters as a legitimate threat and tried to disable their equipment he knew without their laser guns they couldnt stop him    so yeah its a good twist on the classic movies is it amazing it has a few flaws kevin is indeed a bit too dopey for his own good the government trying to cover up ghosts instead of say trying to buy the ghostbusters equipment or just confiscate it on national security grounds is a bit weird and theres a few other minor issues here and there     and godsdammit holtzmann is awesome i love watching her go all mad scientist throughout the movie
Mar 21 2018,negative,dumb reboot  ruined franchise
Mar 20 2018,negative,terrible actresses terrible comedy terrible writing terrible idea and terrible acting yet being the least funny film i have ever seen the only thing that kept me in the theatre was kate mckinnon who seemed like the only funny one in the bunch 15 stars from me this was just too disappointing

Mar 15 2018,negative,im disappointed that i cant give this horrible movie a negative rating
Mar 14 2018,negative,obviously not as good as the original tryhard and browbeating with the whole but girls can be funny too schtick
Mar 13 2018,positive,well i watch the movie on dvd and yes this film was  percent average its funny cheesy and overrated but the box office didnt make the cut and its all because of sony and they wasting their money to tell the truth if like it or hate it this ghostbusters reboot its all about the fans everywhere to generations three stars 
Mar 12 2018,negative,i hated this movie almost unwatchable there is a few funny parts but lacks any type of good writing
Mar 11 2018,negative,more awful th i thiught it was going to be makes me so glad i did not waste my money when it was in theaters watched it on stars and that is two hours i would live to have back
Mar 5 2018,negative,one of only two movies i never seen completely thankfully i rented this because the trailers made it look bad the villain was uninteresting the feminist stuff was forced making every man look stupid plot was uninteresting and the jokes were lame
Mar 3 2018,negative,this film is awful and doesnt stand up to the cult classic one bit massively sexist towards men and an embarrassment to the original
Mar 2 2018,positive,i personally like it better then the original 
Mar 1 2018,negative,a film with great special effects but none of the sense of fun of the original a film aimed squarely at the feminist audience well i hope they enjoyed it at least
Mar 1 2018,positive,not the best film of 2016 but pretty hilarious
Feb 26 2018,negative,loved the all female cast however movie was not funny and it is just a bad movie  there was just no chemistry between the characters all four characters played the comic relief i am still confused if this is a reboot a sequel or a reboot of the sequel
Feb 21 2018,negative,just picture someone spewing in a bucket
Feb 18 2018,neutral,not a good movie and its not because they decided to go with female protagonists but because the movie was just so poorly made just okay
Feb 17 2018,negative,unfunny and plain boring
Feb 17 2018,negative,terrible acting poor history
Feb 17 2018,negative,tbh what was the point on making this it seems like almost everyone has seen the original srsly whats the point
Feb 17 2018,negative,why does hollywood have to ruin everything that was already great and needed no retelling or changes this movie was so terrible disappointing and certainly not funny
Feb 16 2018,negative,the classic me areevil movie
Feb 16 2018,negative,it was like watching your beloved uncle go through a facelift and sex change without anesthesia  a completely unnecessary remake
Feb 12 2018,negative,watching feminist flicks like this makes me wants to bust out pimp track at a feminazi meeting the fucks wrong with these sjw morons dont ever fuck up a good thing get it thru your thick skulls you libtards morons complete crap trap
Feb 12 2018,negative,less than 10 minutes after it ended i was asked what i thought of the movie and id already forgotten id watched it its not bad enough to be upset over but it is the most forgettable movie youll ever see
Feb 11 2018,negative,great lineup of actresses but ruined by storyline
Feb 10 2018,negative,it seems to let down the premise and ride on a meta premise of imagine if women were the ghostbusters  it would be fine to see women in the lead roles if it didnt feel so forced like that was a gimmick in itself i love strong woman and think movies with strong female leads are amazing but these feminist reimaginings that offer nothing to the franchise are just terrible i wish i could take back the time i spent watching this movie
Feb 10 2018,negative,i liked the original more
Feb 8 2018,negative,this was horrible tripe larping as an 80s icon
Feb 8 2018,positive,super funny love the cast
Feb 8 2018,negative,not the worst thing ive seen but what could have been a cool new take on the idea ends up being a poor attempt at remaking the original with some misguided desire to have nonstop jokes speaking over top of each other via improv as opposed to tight script writing
Feb 7 2018,negative,watch the fan edit where they removed a lot of the jokes that just fall flat or hit with a groan and the pacing is greatly improved because of it the edit is a solid 34 stars not this though too many parts that were unnecessary just to give a chuckle at the expense of a good scene
Feb 7 2018,negative,stopped watching half way through the movie the original ghostbusters is a 1000 times better
Feb 3 2018,negative,what a bad idea what a bad movie why were the original ghostbusters in this michael keaton was not a bumbling cop in the dark knight what the heck is this movie a confusing retcon mess
Feb 3 2018,positive,i love the movie its very funny
Feb 2 2018,positive,great to the chicks get down and fun to see all the original cast members almost
Feb 2 2018,negative,it would be better without melissa mccarthy
Feb 1 2018,negative,i like all these actresses  and the movie had a few good jokes  but there werent enough jokes  i was a bit disappointed
Jan 31 2018,negative,just a movie made to please feminists and sjw the whole story is made only to bash man there isnt a single male character in the story with a brain i waited 30 years to see another ghostbusters movie and they throw me this garbage really disappointed the produces really dont care about their audience and fans anymore
Jan 30 2018,negative,well i didnt see it in theaters and boy am i glad i didnt this film was a train wreck from beginning to end my word ignoring the fact that this film was almost purely a vehicle for social justice placing the story and roots of the franchise second it was from beginning to end placing focus on entirely different themes from the old 80s ghostbuster films anyone who has seen the old films that watches this atrocity will be left stunned and speechless as they reel from the sheer gall of the film makers to produce something this inane in a franchise when the originals were so intelligent    save yourself a couple hours even if youre curious as to how bad this movie is just do not watch it
Jan 30 2018,negative,this movie wasted the talent of its cast by substituting listless improv that was so ubiquitous it bordered on tedium for a working script i place the blame squarely on the shoulders of director paul feig  the dialog was incessant and largely filler they say the interview scene had several hours of improvised takes and lines and i suspect they thought they could have the cast riff and cobble together a film out of it   this film was flawed and misdirecting its flaws as an attack on feminism was a sad marketing ploy
Jan 30 2018,positive,goooood doesnt deserve all the hate
Jan 28 2018,negative,the only movie in my life that i have walked out on as it is so bad
Jan 26 2018,positive,as good as the original
Jan 24 2018,negative,you dont have to be sexist to dislike this garbage
Jan 23 2018,positive,meet are new ghostbusters now i like this one more such a silly movie that makes me laugh my favorite part is when they go in the train tracks and they see ghosts find out what shell happen what a good cast in this movie i really hope they will make a sql sweet movie of 2016
Jan 21 2018,negative,pc garbage feminist remake pandering and condescending to literally everyone the fact its at 70 says a lot about the condition cinema is in
Jan 20 2018,positive,loved this movie i even saw it twice on opening day with two different groups very funny well written directed and dont get me started on the comedic talents kate mckinnon is a gem and she shows exactly why in this movie even though its not better than the original ghostbusters its stands on its own quite well i think its a great addition to the ghostbusters world and i sincerely hope we see these busters again in future outings
Jan 14 2018,negative,as a standalone movie its barely worth renting as a remake of a classic it lacks the one liners and originality of the original
Jan 14 2018,neutral,even though its not even close to being as good as the original it does have its moments even though every funny joke is followed up with an unfunny joke it does have some pretty good action sequences i dont think this sucks but it isnt good either its average
Jan 13 2018,positive,i said dont answer    ghostbusters    kate mckinnon steals the show with her comic timing and along with the funniest cast ghostbusters is gripping and tight on screenplay too
Jan 12 2018,negative,one of the worst wastes of a valuable franchise property and a talented cast paul feigs ego and lack of basic understanding of the genre or source material has led to a poorly constructed mess that should be avoided at all cost do not watch
Jan 12 2018,negative,truly the worst movie i have ever seen they never stop talking over one another i was so glad to get peace and quiet when it was over
Jan 9 2018,negative,this is how you dont make a remake of a beloved franchise
Jan 7 2018,negative,ehhh i hope they dont use this formula on all the classics everyone deserves better 
Jan 5 2018,negative,if the intent was to show that women are funny it didnt work the only funny aspect of this film was how hard it flopped at the box office
Jan 5 2018,negative,what happened to film making abysmal movie just plain terrible
Jan 4 2018,negative,utter garbage with bad jokes poor attempts at humour the only pluses are in the better sfx but in every other way it falls far short of the originals
Jan 3 2018,negative,it just wasnt funny they couldnt even catch hardly any ghosts the villain was annoying
Jan 1 2018,positive,the new ghostbusters is not the disaster that i was expecting given the hate surrounding this movie i was expecting the worst its got its flaws but the film is entertaining what i like best and it does keep the original ghostbusters feel and special effects the new women ghostbusters are fine i just feel chris hemsworth is miscast the movie couldve been a little funnier and i wish they had the original ghostbusters in here playing themselves instead of pointless cameos its good for what it is but deafly not as good as the original
Dec 31 2017,positive,the leads have very good chemistry much better than i expected it to be
Dec 31 2017,positive,always a great  comedy
Dec 30 2017,positive,love it perfectly cast kate mckinnon was absolutely brilliant i need more films like this please
Dec 29 2017,negative,not sure why this has a 74 from critics the worst movie ive ever seen would give it zero stars if i could not funny destroys source material and alienates original fans 
Dec 29 2017,negative,if a movie has a feminist narrative or any display of girl power the hollywood critics will throw gold at it this movie bombed at the box office because america wont pay to see hollywood shove their narrative down peoples throats thankfully well be spared a sequel     this is a prime example of why its far better to read users reviews
Dec 28 2017,negative,total garbage its worse than ghostbusters 2
Dec 27 2017,negative,shockingly badwhat more can i say
Dec 26 2017,negative,two stars is generous
Dec 26 2017,negative,this is a spoof of the original and not even a funny one it is disgraceful and a total insult to the original
Dec 24 2017,negative,this movie is a studioproduced hatefilm directed toward white males  the entire movie is designed to marginalize demean and insult white males and only white males  everyone involved in this had their careers ruined and deserved it
Dec 24 2017,negative,why can i not give lower than a half star    did not see this in theater because of the reviews and  the trailer didnt look great    glad i didnt this movie was god awful  terrible b movie quality    this movie should be relegated to the trash bin  of history   do not watch it just pretend it does not exist
Dec 23 2017,negative,poor bad and a sad way to kill a franchise after all the waste of time in that gender fight who puts the director against the fanbase of the original movies and tv show i try to give an opportunity to the movie and the result was awful the movie relies on children jokes lack all the spirit of the original movies and dont bring any new or interesting rip ghostbusters thanks to paul feig this franchise dont rise again from the graveyard even as a ghost
Dec 22 2017,positive,loved it its as funny as the classic ones and the story is original while having the savour of the classic ones really a great movie
Dec 22 2017,negative,i watched this having read all the negativity with an open mind and found the criticisms fell way short of the mark with every single character and extra wisecracking their way through each scene and special effects straight off an xbox one game cut scene this film failed to delivery anything that i would expect from one of the most revered franchises on earth it paints women with a new form of female chauvinism that leaves the cast looking petty and desperate a truly awful cinematic disaster
Dec 21 2017,negative,this film is full of garbage its also kinda racist and full of hate
Dec 21 2017,negative,who has this made for i wondernot me
Dec 21 2017,negative,horrible movie that lost all the magic from the original films
Dec 20 2017,negative,another terrible remake to add to the never ending list it is sony so you get what you pay for which is unfunny and a waste of time but it is forgettable which is the worst part how do you screw up this concept one thing is funny is the filmmakers try to alienate the audience by telling them if you dont like it you are sexist and racist sure that will pack em into theatres lol the controversy was more funny and memorable than this joyless farce
Dec 20 2017,negative,how did this happen a film i looked forward to watching turnt into a absolute joke and not in a good way terrible jokes that dont hit the lack of chemistry between the characters and terrible cgi has turnt the ghostbusters name into a joke poor effort     final score  310
Dec 20 2017,negative,awful disgrace to the original
Dec 16 2017,negative,no one in this team understood why audience loved the original movie
Dec 15 2017,negative,absolutely worst movie ive ever seen a tragedy that doesnt deserve to share a name with the original
Dec 14 2017,negative,this is literally one of the worst movies i have ever seen boring jokes bad story and horrible chemistry
Dec 10 2017,negative,i did not expect a comedy movie
Dec 3 2017,negative,this film is badi mean really badcompare to original ghosbuster movie its looks like a preschool play that made only so that kids feel happy that are playing this
Dec 1 2017,negative,unoriginal and unfunny
Nov 30 2017,negative,best part was the cameos of the original cast
Nov 25 2017,positive,its a pretty good movie
Nov 25 2017,positive,forget the haters this movie was funny
Nov 22 2017,positive,i dont think its that bad not good but okay
Nov 22 2017,negative,its not up to standards  not funny  well kevin were great but the girls have no chemistry
Nov 20 2017,negative,the 1984 version was better
Nov 20 2017,positive,surpasses the original in comedy but not story but the story is still great though
Nov 19 2017,negative,it was trash i thought the critics would realize that
Nov 19 2017,positive,better than the original
Nov 18 2017,negative,this movie shows that this site is bull
Nov 16 2017,positive,fun and funny after all the waiting and back lash i was pleasantly surprised by how much i enjoyed it it is a different movie than the first two which was great because i didnt want to see a rehash of the original like so many movies now days
Nov 12 2017,positive,just watched cause it was supposed to be bad  i should know better it was great going to watch again looking at some of the posts if it was that bad did they even watch or just want to post a hate  weird
Nov 11 2017,positive,was highly entertained and laughed pretty darned hard
Nov 10 2017,positive,as an action movie it was ok as a comedy it sucked and no its not because sexism blah blah all of you shut up about that the jokes sucked because the jokes sucked ok
Nov 10 2017,positive,a solid but unspectacular film that provides a solid cast with enjoyable special effects and ghosts it cannot compare to the original films but it provides an entertaining foray back into the ghostbusters universe that should be enjoyed by the average viewer the one knock i would put on this film is that despite having a great cast of female comedians they really where not very funny the jokes mostly fall flat and i think that is a major reason this film doesnt work that well
Nov 4 2017,negative,those who deflect criticism of this film as just sexism are clearly not particularly attentive to what they are watching on their screen the female characters are not feminist in any respect  all are idiotic irritating people that are painful to watch the kooky queer the sassy black the awkward redhead and the melissa mccarthytm constantly make unfunny annoying jokes every character is the comic relief which becomes incredibly tiresome after about two minutes the film is very poorly paced with scenes being interrupted just for some silly joke about soup the cgi is godawful the films attempt at an 80s vibe colour pallet falling flat chris hemsworths simplistic character adds nothing but more painful jokes the ghosts look bad and the dubstep remix of the original theme song is torturous to listen to i cannot think of anything good to say about this movie filmmakers need to learn that remaking classic movies with women does not automatically equal feminist or femaleempowering i am embarrassed that my gender has been represented by such dumb pointless characters 110 not worth seeing at all
Nov 4 2017,negative,total brainless hollywood executive garbage
Nov 2 2017,negative,i made sure to wait an year till all the controversy around this movie ended and people stopped talking abuot it so that i dont base my opinion on them and recently i came across a run of this on hbo and told myself ok i will give it a shot since theres nothing else currently oni tried watching it i gave gb2016 a fair chance i forced myself through the whole movie i dont have very high standards for humor in movies to begin and despite that  i couldnt even bring myself to laugh not even a small gigle to any of the jokes and comedic scenes the acting i found oknot good and memorable but not as horrific as i was thinking it would be by the end of the credits i could not remember what the plot even was about nor the names of characters and as a whole the movie left me with a bitter taste in my mouth that i was luckily able to wash off immediatly since by a weird twist of fate when i switched to one of the neighboring channels ghostbusters 2 had just came onand if i used to dislike gb2 then gb2016 at least made me apreciate it
Nov 1 2017,negative,apparently there was a script for this mess 
Oct 31 2017,negative,didnt find it funny dont recommend
Oct 29 2017,negative,boring unfunny and weird this atrocity of a film offends the witty classic it dreadfully attempts to mimic

Oct 21 2017,negative,its a 0 cant believe i watched it
Oct 20 2017,positive,funny and great really four intelligent women and some great cgi holtzmann made the movie and to be honest i want another one
Oct 19 2017,negative,why would they make a girl ghostbusters well they made a girl version of ghostbusters because thats what woman wanted even though most of them have not seen the original
Oct 19 2017,negative,like the original ghostbusters is a supernatural comedy about a group of friends who come together to investigate the increase in paranormal activities in the city to be fair to ghostbusters it isnt an awful film but it isnt a great one either there are a lot of jokes and physical comedy that would be entertaining for children but as an adult a lot of the jokes fell flat and some skits went on a little too long to the point that they became awkward melissa mccarthy and kristen wiig have both proven themselves to be excellent comedic actresses but in this film they werent give great material to work with and didnt live up to the standards that theyve set for themselves kate mckinnon was by far the funniest in the film and stole the scene every time she was on screen the plot is also fairly flimsy and chris hemsworths kevin was a little superfluous what was perhaps the biggest mistake was to try and link this new ghostbusters with the original so much rather than letting it stand on its own two feet there are a lot of easter eggs references and some very weak cameos from the original actors from the 1984 ghostbusters that looked like they really didnt want to be there which left a sour taste to the film overall this is probably a film that kids will enjoy but for adults you probably wont want to watch this more than once
Oct 19 2017,negative,i would not recommend this film the story is all over the place and a lot of the film makes no sense by the end of the movie i just didnt care about what was happening
Oct 18 2017,negative,worse movie ive ever seen cheesy one liners had to turn movie off at end during the dual proton pistol was just tondumb to watch i still want my money back for rental and loss of time
Oct 14 2017,negative,so i watched this for the first time laughed 2 times and chuckled once it was more than an hour for the chuckle and 2 hours for the laughs  this is not funny  i had heard i may be surprised  and i was this movie is surprisingly unfunny  i really cannot say more  just a bad movie skip this is you are able
Oct 14 2017,positive,it blows my mind that some people dont like this movie  i loved it and thought it was fantastic  i love the original but honestly thought this one was funnier  maybe its just my type of humor  i thought it was genuinely laugh out loud funny with a great story line fantastic ghost fight scenes and well rounded characters  truly dont see a single thing wrong with it  it was as good of a remake that they could possibly do
Oct 14 2017,negative,what happened to the laid back humor of the originals why is it that now its a bunch of girls they have to scream girl power so loudly and roughly why cant they also have the laid back humor for a girl power movie the best character is a stupid laid back male a female director would have been much more suiatble and would not bave wasted the talent available
Oct 13 2017,negative,the trailer was so bad i downloaded this moovie to not watch it ever
Oct 7 2017,positive,omg really funny i waited to see the movie because some reviews said it wasnt good i laughed the whole time
Oct 7 2017,positive,nothing wrong with this funny entertaining movie  just because its a remake but a good remake
Oct 6 2017,positive,its really not that bad is it good eh thats up for debate but it is certainly not horrible and it definitely doesnt deserve all of the hate it got
Oct 5 2017,negative,complete and utter garbage nothing but a filthy mouthpiece for liberal hollywood
Oct 1 2017,negative,its not that ghostbusters is bad remake it is just a bad film  it fails in every concievable way  prior to its release the premise of using all female leads was considered gimmicky  there is no compelling reason that should result in a bad movie though  women in science face very real cultural issues and that could be a rich source of material  society in general has shifted since the original which came out before personal computers were in every home before the internet before social media and before smartphones  with any ambition you could ask a lot of serious questions and get a lot of funny answers in return  this film is not ambitious  our heroines are empty vessels with a bolted on personality quirk the script is flat and devoid of tension and worse yet humour     this is typified by kate mckinnons character who does weird things things which are not in themselves funny  its just random and we have no since of how she got that way  she does a random weird thing the others look at her like she is weird rinse repeat      we should expect more of any movie not just a remake of a beloved classic
Oct 1 2017,positive,with the way everyone talked about the new ghostbusters movie and saying how bad it is i did put the movie off for quite a long time then it finally came in the mail via netflix so i watched it and it definitely isnt the original or sequel for that matter but isnt as bad as everyone says it is i think the problem is everyone compared it to the original way too much in this day and age when hollywood cant come up with their own ideas you will have people who do that im not one of them    the main problem with the movie was the forced comedy i personally think kristen wiig melissa mccarthy and kate mckinnon are three of the funniest people right now not so much leslie jones she just seems like she takes all the aspects of why people dont like her and tries to make that funny i cant laugh at that because its not funny but the movie had quite a few minutes where the comedy just seemed so force    melissa mccarthy was in another movie that this happened in it was spy in that movie they did try to force laughter but the one person who you wouldnt take for being in a comedy was the funniest person in the movie that being the stath himself here chris hemsworth was easily the funniest person in the movie giving off that dumb pretty boy image was great    then they had the forced cameos from most of the original cast to me that just says we couldnt do this by ourselves if you have to force the cameos in there somewhere youre already in the wrong bills was easily the best but still it didnt need to happen at least you could have used their character names from the original    other than that i did enjoy the movie granted they completely ignored the original and said they were the first to discover paranormal activity the filmmakers seemed to want to make a standalone movie but also rely on the original you cant have it both ways if it was a standalone movie im talking minus the cameos the story was good it almost followed the original with a few minor tweaks in there    then there were the different ghost and what the visual department did with them having a slimer family was quite good    the thing i really wanted to mention in this piece is the upgrades i would love it if the world would go back to the time when technology wasnt so handy and everyone had a computer in their pocket but the movie did bank on the upgraded technology by having new weapons for the ghostbusters to use some of them actually looked believable as well    all in all the movie wasnt as terrible as some people have said but its also not a masterpiece as the original is give it a go if youre feeling antsy but dont expect the same spark the original has    rating 6 out of 10    thats it for me folks if you would like to continue to follow my post go ahead and like this page go check out these sites and dont forget to check out my books i have added the sites to the bottom of the page    twitter timyingling  facebook   publisher      a family affair sites   amazon    solstice     createspace      high school hitmen sites   amazon     solstice     createspace      mistaken sites   amazon     solstice      certain darkening sites    amazon     solstice 
Sep 29 2017,negative,one of the worst movies from last 10 years
Sep 29 2017,positive,this was definitely an interesting remake of a classic film it had absolutely no relation to the original movie so that made it fresh and new but other than that there was little in way of entertainment humor or fun
Sep 29 2017,positive,great fun ride that turns a bit into a video game at the end but that spins into the appeasing all the new fans wowing them with 3deffects  thrills i personally loved the cameos with winks  nods to the 1984 original felt it was a more a than reasonable reboot packed with some jolly good laughs  entertainment
Sep 28 2017,negative,a remake of the 1984 classic finds three scientists and a subway worker forming a team of ghostbusters to fight the growing threat of ghosts attacking new york city despite the great cast the film has a horrible script and very bad direction which drag this film down
Sep 28 2017,positive,really  just didnt work for me  liam hemsworth was hilarious though
Sep 27 2017,negative,this remake of the 1984 comedy classic had everything going for it  good director paul feig and a cast of the funniest actresses with wiig mccarthy mckinnon and jones  unfortunately the script was awful and lame  what shouldve been done is just let this film go the r rated route and let the talented cast loose in their craft  instead it went the ol pg13 route and the end result was a watered down waste of talent  in the remake a bullied recluse devises a machine that unleashes ghosts who soon cause havoc in new york city or another city standing in for nyc  two paranormal scientists a fired columbia university professor and an mta worker join forces to eliminate the ghosts and save the city  the jokes are too tame and stale  only bright moments come from chris hemsworth who plays the brain dead bimbo receptionist  the original cast minus the late harold ramis and rick moranis make cameos that are neither funny nor relevant  such a shame with such a stellar cast and director they couldnt come up with better material than what were presented with  watch the original instead if you want to laugh
Sep 27 2017,positive,great movie i loved this
Sep 26 2017,positive,yeeshfilled with 4 optimistic characters  some dumbass audiences on the concert just for me to bash on with its another one of those films loved by the critics and hated by the fans
Sep 24 2017,neutral,meh nothing on the original  though not the worst movie ive seen
Sep 24 2017,neutral,ok this is probably the most controversial movie ive rated i believed in a female ghostbusters and i did get a small amount of laughs from the film but its bad its not as bad as people thought it was acting like it was the end of the world but no doubt i disliked it the movie was scattered with low brow toilet humor that the original ghostbusters didnt need because of its simplicity this movie was too complicated but yet still dumbed down also just because it wasnt the best we dont need to send the actors death threats because of our sexist views
Sep 23 2017,positive,this movie is probably one of the good reboots out there the jokes arent always so funny at times and falls flat but the action scenes they blew my mind the story is basic and easy to follow and its entertaining as hell
Sep 19 2017,negative,how did they obtain a nuclear bomb and put it on their car  you wont find an explanation in the movie  why did the bad guy die and become a big bad ghost  because he wanted to of course  just wanted to  everyone seemed to play the same character  we could set the bar way way lower but it wouldnt seem right considering all the exist and feminist talk  no if all is evensteven then this movie is just a crime
Sep 18 2017,negative,52 audience score yet a 73 tomatometer score dont cross the streams ray
Sep 17 2017,negative,this movie got good reviews just because its not politically correct to critic women movies
Sep 15 2017,positive,i loved this movie im not sure what everyones problem is
Sep 13 2017,positive,its not the most original story out there but it is funny and entertaining and the characters are great and most of all it delights my feminist heart four diverse women saving the world while not having to wear tight leathers and while chris hemsworth serves as eyecandy sign me up
Sep 11 2017,positive,i am convinced that the negative audience scores are from really petty people who made up their minds to hate this movie before they ever saw it  if they saw it at all  the sexist attitude against this female version is ridiculous  the cast is phenomenal and has terrific chemistry  as with the original movie i didnt care so much about the actual ghost scenes  it was the characters backstories and interactions that won me over  the stars and director paul feig are all gems  if there were any justice in the world wed be getting a gb 2
Sep 11 2017,positive,who are you going to call ghostbusters and now they have made a good remake and i find it to be better so when you watch this movie you have to figure out who is creating these ghosts where they coming from so basically you got to be a detective and figure it out its a silly movie i recommend it
Sep 10 2017,positive,this movie is excellent  good humor great effects and to the nay sayers who may not have even seen this film before trashing it you dont know what youre missing  i sincerely hope they plan to do a sequel and soon
Sep 10 2017,negative,wow is this crappy or what downright the worst movie i have seen in a while to add insult to the injury managed to stumble upon an extended bluray version which is 18 minutes longer than theatrical  whopping 134 minutes in all  yes this is the allgirlsremake of the 1980s darling horror comedy franchise this time starring kristen wiig melissa mccarthy and er the other ones most of the original cast return with surprise cameos too excluding of course the late harold ramis  this is just a sad fuckup of a movie where everybody tries and tries for two hours and more but nothing worthwhile emerges  the only good thing i can think about the movie is that at least they have tried for a long time they try to make us laugh with their witty bantering dialogue and good chemistry but none of it materialises and the result is dead on arrival  alongside anchorman 2 and zoolander 2 this must be one of the biggest failures of recent times where they tried to bring back some cult classic and just fell on their asses  ghostbusters is so bereft of laughs or joy that it feels shitty even by movies starring melissa mccarthys standards whos still desperately trying to define and recreate this little magic she managed to create in her breakthrough role in 2011s bridesmaids  the same goes to paul feig of course who has mostly directed mccarthys movies the first and only creatively successful one being bridesmaids of course he should go back to tv world or something  rotten tomatoes and metacritics reviews are far too kind this time the most telling would be the latters user score of 29 out of 10  the only bits i at least semienjoyed in the movie were original ghostbusters surprise cameo appearances and maybe chris hemworth as the goodlooking but stupid assistant to the girls hes the closest thing this entertainment had to offer to make me smile  the visual effects look cheap too although this may be some kind of homage to original movies
Sep 9 2017,negative,garbage garbage garbage   this god awful shitty feminist movie ruined my favorite franchise as a kid
Sep 8 2017,negative,despite the great cast the movie is pretty mediocre the only funny moments are the cameos of the real ghostbusters
Sep 8 2017,positive,this movie while still inferior to the 84 classic delivers some good laughs despite a lame villian
Sep 3 2017,negative,nothing like the original and quite honestly a really bad copyreboot
Sep 3 2017,negative,has its moments but not anywhere close to any of the originals
Sep 2 2017,negative,this movie is absolutely the worst example of movies and the weird state that hollywood is in none of the jokes are funny the references to the old movies dont make any sense and the cast is probably the worst thing im all for the female cast  but they chose the the most shit stereotypes out there edgy teenyoung adult fat lonely women sophisticated women and loud black lady which could be considered as racism in conclusion this movie is pandering to low intelligent females and sjws fuckyou10
Sep 1 2017,negative,this is quite possibly the worst fucking movie ive ever seen totally unnecessary remake of an overrated original
Sep 1 2017,negative,horrible movie which is only made worse by the social engineering
Aug 30 2017,negative,this film was so terrible and boring and well very very dumb and lame too the cast was not funny at all and the guest appearances of the true ghostbusters also were very silly why couldnt they simply make a goddamn sequel
Aug 27 2017,positive,not as endearing as the original but certainly different enough to make it worth watching  the comedic antics and quirkiness especially of mckinnon worked for me
Aug 26 2017,negative,this movie is the worst thing ever happened to hollywood in the past 25 years may be how can there be cast of women in a movie like this is beyond me and ok let it be women but at least put them all to be attractive not these fat repulsive  and why calling it ghostbusters without any reference with the first two movies its like they didnt exist the jokes in this are bad and unfunny the effects are horrible its like in the haunted mansion the actresses are not in their place  shouting and doing ridiculous things which are not funny     bottom line the worst movie in the past 2530 years
Aug 26 2017,negative,literally one of the worst movies i have ever seen
Aug 25 2017,positive,good movie also very funny 
Aug 25 2017,negative,i admire the effort but theres no way it will stand the test of time
Aug 21 2017,positive,this film didnt deserve all the hate its seriously funny
Aug 21 2017,negative,ive watched very few movies that were so bad that i wished that i could have gotten the time used to watch the film back so that i could use it to do something else  this is one of those films  another hollywood cash grab attempting to use nostalgia to bank cash  sony please stop making movies  you dont know how
Aug 21 2017,negative,loud and obnoxious with characters of which you do not feel empathy unlike the original where you cared very much for these people thats why the original is still beloved some 30 years after its release but you actually run the gamut of feelings starting with groan to dislike and finally hate note to melissa mccarthy and leslie jones loud and obnoxious does not equal funny usually when it comes to comedy the more subtle the joke the funnier the joke which is why no one remembers gallagher anymore so epic failure for this train wreck of a movie im not sure i believe the professional critics who gave ghostbusters an average score of 73 but the audience score of 52 while still far too high is the correct review still 48 of the audience rate it fresh it doesnt take much to impress the millennials and under these days but they also think socialism is better than capitalism so i suppose we are doomed in the not to distant future to live out our days waiting in long lines for hours at the grocery store in order to purchase one loaf of bread and a can of beets while remembering we used to stand in such lines for crap like ghostbusters 2016
Aug 20 2017,positive,the cast was good kristen wiig gave the best performance and leslie jones was pretty great too but the second half of the movie just wasnt funny at all had the the film continued being as funny as the first half was ghostbusters would have been a much better movie
Aug 17 2017,negative,for some reason there is a lot of dancing terrible reboot
Aug 17 2017,negative,paul feig ruins everything ill never forget the smear campaign sony did to james rolf whos way more talented than these hacks
Aug 17 2017,negative,although it had a few great moments including all the enjoyable cameos some beautiful vfx and palpably excellent chemistry between the new cast every other thing about the film seemed like it was trying far too hard what made the originals so good was the perfect balance between subtle wry humour and scary dramatic and weighty moments something this new version failed in the utmost regard to get right it certainly had potential but its definitely not there yet
Aug 16 2017,positive,hilarious and it stuck true to the original although it is impossible to completely stay true to an original
Aug 16 2017,negative,greg greg smith founder of agile writers of richmond va well scott they ve rebooted ghostbusters what d you think    scott dr scott allison professor of psychology university of richmond these days it s hard to find a movie that isn t a reboot of something let s recap    greg we re introduced to dr abby yates melissa mccarthy and dr erin gilbert kristen wiig who are estranged friends over a book on the paranormal they wrote together yates is studying paranormal events with dr jillian holtzmann kate mckinnon at a community college the three decide to go into business together when a local museum has a haunting and gilbert is  slimed     scott a fourth ghostbuster patty tolan leslie jones joins the group after she witnesses a ghostly entity in the new york subway the group hires a receptionist pretty boy kevin beckman chris hemsworth who is quite dimwitted bad guy rowan north neil casey an occultist with a chip on his shoulder develops a device that summons all the ghostly spirits to wreak havoc upon new york    greg this is the 2016 reboot of the 1984 classic while many have compared the two films i prefer to review this incarnation of the film on its own merits and frankly i was disappointed there isn t much of a story here the characterizations are thin in favor of a large number of grandiose special effects like so many of the summer blockbusters this year this is all about the experience and not about either story nor characters    scott i pretty much agree greg in many ways this movie reminds me of independence day resurgence which also took a pretty good movie from yesteryear and made little effort to improve upon it i will give this edition of ghostbusters credit for casting women in the lead roles which is a nice sign of progress for a movie industry that so desperately needs to broaden its inclusivity it was also nice to see the bimbo secretary for the ghostbusters be a male rather than a female airhead the movie also portrays erin gilbert s college dean who denies her tenure to be a stuffy old male who obviously misjudges her he s a fool as is the male head of the next college that denies our heroes space to do their work in our review of melissa mccarthy s last movie the boss we mentioned that all of mccarthy s movies tend to turn gender roles on their heads the only thing this version of ghostbusters could have done to further the cause was to cast the main villain as a female it didn t but the film still issues a strong statement about the emergence of women as heroes in the movies    greg frankly i thought the allfemale cast was more of a gimmick than anything else we reviewed 2013 s the heat also a melissa mccarthy film with sandra bullock it was kind of lethal weapon with women and like the heat there is little in this film that was improved by the allfemale cast certainly nothing in the movie made issue of the fact that the ghostbusters were women while that may be a step forward for womankind it does stretch believability as surely there would be some misogyny encountered were it the real world  but it was absent in the film other than that there isn t a lot to talk about with this film there are some nice cameos by members of the original cast i thought kate mckinnon s performance as the bizarre supernerd holtzmann was overthetop goofy at the end of the film she makes a side comment about finally belonging somewhere now that she s a member of the ghostbusters but we were never given an inkling that alienation was a concern for holtzmann so it s a throwaway line for a character that was paper thin to begin with and so it is for all the characters in this film there was no room for character growth when the spectacle of cgi was the real star    scott character growth was never a goal when they set out to make this movie the goal was to make money by showing people getting slimed by ghosts so you re right greg that this movie provides some mild fun and entertainment but gives us little to sink our teeth into you know a movie is in trouble when the highlight of the film is the series of cameos by the original cast from 30 years ago in terms of mentorship we learn that sigourney weaver mentored kate mckinnon s character although we never see the mentorship in action in an ironic twist our two ghostbusting authors abby yates and erin gilbert wrote a book that served as inspiration for bad guy rowan north we could call this an accidental or inadvertent mentorship which is rarely seen in the movies    greg ghostbusters is a runofthemill summer blockbuster where cgi is the star and story and character take a backseat there were few jokes and way too many nods to the original despite the great pains to make this new incarnation original i m ok with a film being strictly a nobrainer when all you want is to get out of the summer heat but ghostbusters offers little more than a visual feast i can only summon 2 out of 5 reels the heroes walk through the movie with little if any conflict to be resolved there is a nice bit about the mayor of the town confidentially supporting our heroes only to disavow them to the public not because he s evil but because he needs to distance himself from paranormal types or seem unmayorly it was an interesting twist on the usual villain character but it made for lackluster conflict and without conflict there is little transformation i only have 2 heroes for our gruesome foursome as you point out scott there is little mentoring there is a cute cameo at the end where sigourney weaver pops in as an older version of holtzman giving praise so we have an implied mentor but nothing concrete which sums up the whole of ghostbusters lots of slimey attempts at humor action and relationships but nothing concrete i give the mentors in this movie just 1 mentor out of 5  reels heroes mentors    scott greg for me the cgi wasn t good enough to be the star of ghostbusters  run of the mill  about sums up the quality and contributions of this movie i d only recommend it for fans of kristen wiig fans of melissa mccarthy and absolute fanatics of the original 1980s version there is no new comedic ground broken here just some mild fun and a few pleasant cameos from the original cast i do like the allwoman heroic ensemble but this grouping is not enough to salvage the movie greg your rating of 2 reels out of 5 seems just about right to me this hero ensemble does go on a journey that resembles the classic hero s quest in myth and literature but this journey is only a loose skeleton designed to hold the mediocre jokes together there isn t much character transformation unless you count people becoming convinced of the reality of ghosts as a transformation our heroes accomplish their mission but there s nothing to distinguish this mission again a rating of 2 out of 5 heroes seems appropriate i ve already pointed out sigourney weaver s mentoring role which is merely mentioned in passing but never shown and our villain was mentored albeit inadvertently by two of our four ghostbusters overall it s pretty clear that this movie isn t really about mentoring only slime and so i can only award 2 mentors out of 5  reels heroes mentors
Aug 15 2017,negative,adlib and off timed comedy in copypasta ripoff from the originals    it was meant to be a serious and actually in the origonals kind of scary ghost movie    thanks for ruining one of my childhood favorite franchises    all paul feig movies are trash hes a b movie director due to the fact he only knows how to do dreary monotonous and repetitive viewer friendly tv shows    someone employ paul feig in an elementarypreschool mediamarketing department his emotional iq range he portrays is still stunted at that age level    for everyones own good
Aug 15 2017,negative,not a single laugh lowbrow and juvenile describe paul feigs terrible remake best
Aug 13 2017,negative,regardless of opinion of the original ghostbusters there is one simple irrefutable fact this is not a funny movie it just isnt to all the people heralding this as progressive or intelligent it just isnt in the first 20 minutes theres a queef joke half the jokes of this film revolve around the soooo random and quirky character reeking of desperation wontons soup and making chris hemsworth unlikeable the delivery is poor the characters reactions are bland and there are next to no jokes with an actual set up and punchline of quality any jokes are just slightly odd actions with no rhyme and reason or actual quality structurethe kind of jokes can work but need talented actors and reactions to make them work leslie jones and slimer got maybe a couple of chuckles out of me but asides from them i was just sat there bored to tears   i have no problem with people liking this movie we all have our guilty pleasure flicks i however condemn any professional critic saying its a qualitatively good film the writing is poor the effects bland and dear god how do you make chris hemsworth unlikeable
Aug 12 2017,negative,i heard about the hate but i wanted to see for myself these people have been another shows in other bodies of work theyve been entertaining this should have been a formula for success this just proves how filmmaking is as much art as science this is the film equivalent of primary schoolers making breakfast in bed for mothers day this film clunks along through juvenile humor like the new kid in school trying to make everybody like her by trying to be funny it feels like it was written by primary schoolers i tried to like this movie i tried hard i tried as hard as this movie tried to be funny we both failed utterly miserably so much fail
Aug 11 2017,positive,i know it did bad at theaters but i didnt hate it
Aug 10 2017,negative,how high are the critics who have this good reviews even if you hadnt seen the original this movie fails on many levels the only good this that can be said is it looks pretty
Aug 9 2017,negative,save yourself the time and just force a toothpick into your ear
Aug 8 2017,positive,this recent installment is full of good special effects of course maybe too much other than that not too many flaws the story holds on the winks on the previous ghost busters were all nice kristen was very funny the most funny id say i definitely like the funny girls and when the serious girl get funny
Aug 7 2017,positive,1117  we watched this several months ago i cant give it a true rating but i remember laughing a lot in the beginning  i think the story was pretty lame and it really stopped being funny toward the end because they had some ghosts to kill i dont remember all that well though
Aug 6 2017,negative,this is actually a zero star movie   if you loved the classic ghostbusters movies this is going to drive you up a wall   it was silly slapstick meh   the first and second movie was awesome this was just  eh  no
Aug 4 2017,positive,i wanted to hate this film i really did from the first trailer i was on the hate wagon the jokes were falling flat the ghosts were meh the worst party was the supposed reimagining of the classic ghostbusters theme by emo band fall out boy and missy elliott one of the worst pieces of music ever and the power of patty compeles you gag    dispite this i went to see it i have since bought the bluray and have watched both the theatric version and extended many times the cast is truly the best part of the equation i adore kate mckinnons holtzmann who delivers the best lines although leslie jones has hands down the best line in the film with okay room full of nightmares    better then ghostbusters ii
Aug 3 2017,negative,quite possibly the worst movie ever made
Aug 3 2017,positive,it may not be as good as the 1st ghostbusters but this one still has charm and humorous scenes
Jul 30 2017,positive,ummmmhow to remake the original 80s classic without it feeling cheesy and rehashed  answer  you cant this feels cheesy and rehashed the cast melissa mccarthy in particular and the humour that they play out very well is really all that this film has going for it all a bit meh actually
Jul 29 2017,negative,im not really sure why this film was made i love the original if it was just to add another cast with talented female actors instead then im not sure it was worth it with this particular film
Jul 29 2017,positive,a fun interesting and hilarious movie that treats its female characters with respect its a refreshing change when female audience members get to be in on the jokes instead of just the butt of them
Jul 29 2017,negative,the writing wasnt good for the characters these women are much funnier then this not a good remake they should have left it alone
Jul 25 2017,positive,not the best but not the worst
Jul 24 2017,negative,aggressively unfunny and wastes great talent like melissa mccarthy kristen wiig and kate mckinnon leslie jones was just awful and stupid on every level her jokes if you can eve call them that were all weak as water and worse than those of the master of disguise chris hemsworth is portrayed as someone with the iq of a potato in a clearly panderingbased movie do not ever watch this absolute travesty of a movie that spits on a classic
Jul 23 2017,positive,i think the movie is really funny and i love the quirky characters
Jul 22 2017,negative,i swear i smelled a fecal odor coming through the screen as i watched  awful dialogue  hamfisted horribly unfunny jokes  bad cgi  just an all around garbage movie
Jul 22 2017,positive,this is everything i want from an snl film great characters great script great cast very salty parabola
Jul 22 2017,positive,this is everything i want from an snl film great characters great script great cast very salty parabola
Jul 22 2017,negative,tedious schlock of a movie hemsworth was the only watchable part the rest was just painfully boring and the four leads were the worst
Jul 19 2017,negative,a terrible movie that was nowhere close to being as good as the original the special effects werent good for a movie with its huge budget also the script was written for stupid people to understand
Jul 19 2017,positive,not a bad movie  better than i thought  i thought at times they tried too hard to be funny but overall a very action lacked comedic film  i actually didnt mind the gender swap after watching it and chris hemsworth was hilarious in this film
Jul 18 2017,neutral,i fell asleep at some point and i usually will watch a movie all the way through
Jul 16 2017,positive,i thought melissa mccarthy was great but kristen wiig as the straight man character is such a miss
Jul 16 2017,negative,dream team comediennes star in ab unfab gb rehash
Jul 16 2017,negative,theres an unofficial list of movies that shouldnt ever be rebooted  citizen cane back to the future star wars saving private ryan the godfather indiana jones planet of the apes ghostbusters etc  so it was no surprise when this movie didnt live up to the original  it wasnt fault of the actorsactresses involved as much as it was the terrible script  the plot tried to replace the original while simultaneously shoving nestslgia down the  throats of the audience  the whole movie felt forced and unoriginal  then again if hollywood had any original ideas they wouldnt have to try and reboot every famous movie ever made  it doesnt help that tumblr tries to murder you if you tell the honest truth that chris hemsworth was the only person who made me vocally laugh the whole movie  i love all the actors involved but much like the green hornet not even an all star cast can save a truly bad movie
Jul 15 2017,positive,decent effort turns into a mediocre though watchable slime fest c
Jul 15 2017,positive,this movie honored the original my family and i really liked it
Jul 13 2017,negative,forced awkward and unclear motivations this film is trying to hard to be funny and that makes it feel unnatural and forced
Jul 13 2017,negative,i trusted rotten tomatoes on reviews but after the reviews on this movie i can not trust it back to imdb this movie is a disgrace and its not the sexism factor its just terrible if your gonna remake a movie why make it completely different nothing from the original is in the movie apart from the cameos from the original actors its based on slapstick comedy when the original is witty the cgi is just shockingly bad near the end it feels like im playing the game again they use melissa mccarthy as the slapstick falling over and stupid comedy thats not funny its been done in every comedy movie she has done when she is a good actor and better used in serious roles the whole movie feels like a spoof movie and a poor one i rather watch scary movie 5 than this at least that made me laugh once this movie was a joke and it doesnt make sense when u make a remake its better when its similar feel or relates to the original or an updated version this has nothing at all at least the new mummy has a connection this has nothing i cannot see how this movie gets any stars at all its an embarrassment the gender thing has blinded everyone and rather make a statement then look at the movie for what it is if your gonna take a beloved franchise and rather listen to the fans and try and make a statement your gonna get a backlash but if you make a remake of it that has no connection what so ever apart from the name its doomed from the start if they wanted to add women why not 2 of each and then go from there that would keep everyone happy from the start and also who the hell is neil casey they could of got a more well established actor to play the bad guy to end this rant wtf was the ending dancing around and flying that was the worst thing ever i felt embarrassed for everyone who watched that i had to turn it off to wrap it all up this movie is not funny and feels like a very poor spoof movie and blinded people with the sexism front and not seeing the movie for what it is
Jul 12 2017,negative,great cast  awful director who was massively out of his depth and ruined the film he is great at directing female cast comedies evidenced by spy  bridesmaids but he clearly didnt understand ghostbusters and the original fan base which helped make the film such a success he neglected this and relied on the original spooks to help boost interest the story line was lame at best  the special effects dated and unoriginal poor soundtrack awful merchandise and sadly my children think the computer game is the pits   thanks for ruining a classic
Jul 11 2017,negative,what a complete and utter trainwreck of a socalled movie an insult to the original
Jul 11 2017,negative,im so sorrythis movie really represents the power of womenbut that wont protect the fact that this is just horrible instead of punishing my children when they do something badill let them sit and watch this movie
Jul 10 2017,positive,ill start out by admitting that i will never be able to give this movie a truly unbiased review as i am one of the haters and no not because the studio dared to remake ghostbusters with women its because they dared to remake ghostbusters period i dont care if they remade it with aborigines or toddlers or the canadian transgender luge team or just another four dudes it makes no difference if ever there was sacrilege in the film industry this is it and it is something that i will never ever forgive that being said i really did try to watch this objectively does it have good writing an engaging story competent actingdirecting is it funny and the answer to those questions for the most part is yes all four of these women are funny in their own right but the real scenestealers of the film are kate mckinnon who had a leg up as she was playing what is essentially a combination of egon and venkman and surprisingly chris hemsworth who is a treat as the dumbasastump assistant a fun play on the dumb secretary cliché the film does a good job setting up the story and characters and even provides a few laughs along the way but it takes a serious turn in the third act and plummets into derivate actionmoviefinale hell its just like the original finale but on meth and without an awesome villain seriously some schlub who has literally 5 minutes of screen time is supposed to rival gozer the gozerian please though there are many things that make this film different from and less than the original what jumped out at me most was the pure malevolence of the ghosts in the original they were more meddling and bothersome but didnt actually hurt people with of course the exception of the 2 demonic possessions but these ghosts are out for blood to the point that it sometimes feels like a horror film especially the opening sequence its a little offputting for what should be a feelgood comedy and is also a concern for those who want to watch with small children  too scary i could go on about how this movie is a shadow of its predecessor but instead i will just sum it up and say that while its not a great movie its not terrible either as much as i malign its existence it is not an unholy beast that will destroy your childhood with its violent moneygrubbing fangs its just your average forgettable summer comedy
Jul 10 2017,positive,with a rebooted cast and story its funny and enjoyable
Jul 8 2017,positive,with a rebooted cast and story its funny and enjoyable
Jul 6 2017,positive,i was very skeptical that this movie would be any good as i was such a huge fan of the originaland i was totally wrong this movie rocks hilarious entertaining our whole family loves this movie so much we watch it again and again so desperately want them to make a sequel to this with the same cast i would absolutely watch in the theatre again i was such a huge fan of the original movies and so i didnt see the reboot in the theatre but i bought this movie after watching it the first time because we loved it so much that i knew we would watch it a million times it is funnier then the original movies the women are fantastic its fresh and such an awesome change from all of the male dominated movies these days highly recommend this movie
Jul 4 2017,neutral,would have been a genuinely fun flick if the original didnt existbut it just cant compare and you spend the whole film doing just that why go there hollywood too classic to be touched even if you do try it with girls in an attempt to spin it off on its own only standout was chris hemsworths genuinely funny performancegreat glimpse of the possibilities
Jul 4 2017,positive,even better than the original
Jul 2 2017,neutral,no words for how horrible this movie was
Jul 2 2017,neutral,a very middleoftheroad reboot that has an equal amount of moments that really work and moments that fail on arrival
Jun 27 2017,negative,lets be honest here the female cast was a ploy it was a nickelodeon style plot that had way too many holes and a weak villan it tried shoulder shrug it barely accomplished to be more watchable than ghostbusters 2 which isnt saying much this film was a warm flat can of caffeine free diet ghostbusters
Jun 26 2017,neutral,barely a pass but entertaining enough fun cameos and a hilarious kate mckinnon steals the show
Jun 26 2017,positive,it wasnt as bad as i thought it would be and it definitely had some funny parts but it was nowhere near as good as the 1984 original it was mostly full of colorful visual gags and doesnt really pass as a real ghost movie
Jun 25 2017,negative,god awful movie im glad i didnt see this in the theaters i would have asked for a refund ghostbusters is officially ruined forever thanks politically correct sony and all the feminazis out there social justice warriors how do you like your movie now
Jun 20 2017,negative,every single male character is annoying   really bad feminism that opposes men to women  hated the movie
Jun 20 2017,negative,with an amazing cast of second citytrained actors an experienced comedic writerdirector and a proven storyline this movie should have been spectacular perhaps it would have worked better not as a reboot but instead as a distant sequel this movie could have been better if it relied less on references from the original movie and obnoxious special effects and more on the raw talent and improvisational ability of its comedians
Jun 20 2017,positive,the crybaby manchildren who didnt want this movie are really missing out this movie is better than gb2  for sure in fact i would put it just below par with the first one  funny and quirky these ladies deliver what is true ghostbusters fans wanted a good time and a trip down memory lane my 3 year old son absolutely loves it and that makes me happy     one thing that needs to be pointed out kate mckinnons performance was amazing she is a phenomenal character actor and her snl work only intensifies her brilliance    nevermind what the crybabies say check this movie out its good
Jun 20 2017,positive,direction and plot are a bit clumsy but the cast is excellent and the film is very well produced
Jun 18 2017,negative,watching ghostbusters 2016 is like watching a stage 4 cancer patient slowly die with the kate mckinnon character jillian holtzmann being used as the morphine as you see the cancer patient slowly go into deaths waiting arms
Jun 16 2017,positive,probably gonna be on the top 5 list of underrated films of 2016 this film surprised me i really enjoyed it i wasnt expecting to enjoy it after everyone gave the trailer and the idea hate i would recommend that people see this movie      rating 7310
Jun 13 2017,positive,the most controversial flick that i have ever seen and theyre overlooking some of the good parts of this flick
Jun 13 2017,negative,unfunny bad acting and terrible story decent action at times although
Jun 10 2017,negative,i watched this film with an open mind i was sorely disappointed i have great admiration for all of the actresses and actors however i felt that the humor fell flat i have enjoyed their work in other films i think that there are some strong elements
Jun 10 2017,negative,vomiting on the classic original and thats just the promotion campaign by sony the films twice as bad 100 minutes no jokes
Jun 7 2017,positive,i love this movie its my favorite comedy movie remake i love the climax its more entertaining then the original climax the action is a lot better then the original all they do in the original is stand there and shoot but this one they do flips and throw ghost grenades and the music is awesome during the fight scene the only issue i have is the villain chris hemsworth as the receptionist is better then the original receptionist he did something for the movie unlike the original receptionist the original receptionist is just there i love the ghost effects and the female ghostbusters cast they are funny and awesome i hope this movie will get a sequel please let it happen
Jun 6 2017,negative,doesnt add anything new to the franchise
Jun 6 2017,neutral,if this movie did not have semifunny acting then it would be a complete waste of time it is 2016 and i expected these sad excuses for animation to be on point that ending also had brought another terrible decision of having them hang in this weird vortex turned a beautiful classic film into a classless movie
Jun 6 2017,negative,boring long and obvious jokes
Jun 6 2017,negative,disappointed by the hints at and outright female chauvinisms in this movie including making all the men look stupid not that im against the government being made to look stupid it would have been a way better movie without it feminism is supposed to establish equality for women not superiority good story good acting
Jun 5 2017,positive,love it  watch it over and over great humor funny cameos and callouts but stands on its own personally i like it better than the original  as i found bill murray unpleasantly sleazy theres a similarity but with a lot less sleaze in a female character persuing the male hottie  its far more humorous     my husband is a huge ghostbusters fan he too loves this movie
Jun 4 2017,negative,ghostbusters2016 is not a good movie it pretty much sucks there are good things about this movie but it sucks so much
Jun 3 2017,negative,the worst remake ever the only good thing is the dan aykroyd cameo after that i didnt finish the movie
Jun 2 2017,negative,terrible rehash with a bad cast and poor effects
Jun 1 2017,positive,i loved the new ghostbusters reboot the actresses are hilarious the graphics and writing were great and the plot was engaging great movie
Jun 1 2017,negative,in contrast to the gender politics surrounding this film this films seems rather tame if there is a profeminist message to the film its lost among cliche characters bland writing and poor chemistry even those who havent seen gasp horror or were fans of the original movies may be confused about what this film is trying to achieve     the plot is extremely predictable that tries to mimic the force awakens method of retelling the original story in a new manner the main failure to this however is the acting is far from convincing and its a story told a million times over creepy things happen people try to prove ghosts noone believes them they end up right catch ghosts big event happens they save the world all this happens while ignoring the events of the original films for no real apparent reason fans of the original films will also be disappointed the art direction this movie takes as most of the ghosts are now shown in low quality neon cgi and talking about special effects the opening setting up scene prior to the ghostbusters title at the beginning of the film is potentially the worst i have seen in recent years my partner who i watched the film with seemed confused to the actual reasoning behind using the ghostbusters trademark sure it had ghosts in it however the art direction is so drastically different the story tries to be new but ultimately is the same story and its done far worse she felt there was no point to the movie and this was coming from someone who was excited to see the film and only watched the originals for the first time a few nights before to hype herself up she also highlighted the amount of times they tried to reference the original films but otherwise ignored them completely    the acting is a mixed bad as are the characters i couldnt help but resist enjoying kate mckinnons performance in this film okay it may be too obviously trying to recreate egon quirky side from the original but it was fun and convincing leslie jones also had her moments but many of her lines often descended into stereotypical streetwise wisecracking i think at one point she even highlights how streetwise she is but lacks the others smarts    the biggest actors were the most unconvincing melissa mccarthy seemed to be trying to recreate dan aykroyd the result is a complete mess herself and kristen wig lack their normal chemistry and their lines seem entirely flat she often devolves into techno babble lines that seem about as convincing as me trying to explain quantum physics to master students hint i have no idea what is even involved in quantum physics kristen herself is seemingly reduced to the most boring and uninteresting role in the film which is despite being the role with the most screen time finally chris hemsworth while offering some entertainment is basically reduced to a character so stupid it often reduces the film to the level of an extremely crude slapstick comedy    in conclusion in contrast to the films prerelease claims of trying to create something new it falls flat on its face and instead tries to recreate the original film to an extremely muted effect its not bad per se just it doesnt add anything new to the franchise the best way to describe this film as worded by my partner was bland sure its consumable and will fill your time up but it will not do anything for you in the short nor long run theres no thrills no excitement or horror its just a film that tries to recreate the success of the originals but doesnt go anywhere i have a sneaking suspicion that the critic reviews were propped up b the gender wars surrounding the films release i rate this film 25
Jun 1 2017,positive,i bursted out laughing several times in the theater
Jun 1 2017,positive,hilarious one of my favorite movies
May 30 2017,positive,enjoyed this one a lot  love all of the women involved and chris hemsworth  good god do i love him for this movie    the flaw in this movie was the villain  i liked the premise  demonstrating how nice guys often handle rejection in their life whether its specific or general by turning to aggression and even violence and contrasting it with the reactions of the women to the rejection of their professional lives going out and doing it anyway  id love to have seen that idea developed a lot more but unfortunately the movie just didnt have time so that concept is only lightly touched on in the basement scene and then never touched on again  as it is they still had a pretty rushed final villain battle that wasnt as satisfying as one might have hoped feeling like its over before its begun      having said that im not really sure which way they should have gone as i said i dont think there was enough time to develop the idea and still keep enough development for the main characters but otoh a standard cookie cutter villain unless it was really well done and it might have been could have left it feeling empty and lacking something    other than that though i enjoyed everything  i loved the interaction of the women with each other i loved hemsworths dedication to playing the male version of the brainless sex kitten dude in distress i really loved the idea to move away from traditional proton packs and try new things not just because it led to that glorious kate mckinnon scene but at the same time yeah a lot because of that glorious kate mckinnon scene
May 30 2017,negative,this is the type of movie that you would want to see on a sunday afternoon when you have nothing to do and someone else is footing the bill otherwise horrible movie
May 28 2017,positive,it was entertaining but i didnt expect much before i went in they had the previous ghostbusters do bit parts
May 27 2017,negative,well it was better than the first pixels
May 27 2017,negative,utter trash pushing the female agenda its an insult the the original film and sexist against men
May 26 2017,negative,not funny when all try to be funny the original has more straight person to play off of this felt like forced funny
May 24 2017,positive,if you dont compare to the original its entertaining enough  as a remake i thought it was refreshing to see all woman obviously stating it is not trying for something different than the original     if you do compare to the original it sucked
May 23 2017,negative,ya 73 my ass this movie sucks
May 21 2017,negative,didnt think it was all that they wouldve been better off making ghostbusters 3 rather than taking the original format and changing it slightly but having women instead of men as the lead characters some good bits but its such an echo of the original movie it ruined it for me such a shame i had high hopes for this nice to see 5 of the original cast members in it poor harold has since died though and moranis is no longer in the limelight but the others put a smile on my face
May 20 2017,negative,the worst comedy movie ever made a stale bad end of the show snl quality to it that wreaks of rehash anns gives bad jokes  the queef and fart joke combo as the first laugh set the tonehorrid
May 13 2017,positive,funnyyou will laugh til your sides hurtall the original cast back for cameos
May 12 2017,negative,watched it tonight after avoiding it for the longest time  i liked the original but i found this version to be just okay  my opinion is that the writing and the jokes were lazy  in the original the characters took the job seriously and they had to work to just capture one ghost  in this one they were slaying ghosts right and left making a mockery of the storyline  the acting was decent given the script  but there is no overcoming the poor writing
May 12 2017,negative,as bad as expected but i think the target audience was a lot younger for this the original had so much more going on in the story and much better comedy while this remake was all style no substance and the comedy was terrible
May 11 2017,negative,starts off with a bare scare then quickly ramps up to some subtle acting perfection from kate mckinnon wilg and mccarthy follow poor jones makes the attempt but falls flat hemsworth is the eye candy     the whole thing is forced youll like it to the halfway point im betting then it falls like the ghost goop on the characters
May 10 2017,negative,a train wreck is funnier than this garbage i attempted to watch it when came got to cable but it too stupid to sit for more than 10 minutes you have to be brainwashed to even think has any value
May 10 2017,negative,rating  4810  a 2 hour and 13 minute comedy and scored a total of 3 laughs  what else can you say but boo
May 9 2017,negative,an ok reboot of ghostbusters no comedians can top the original ghostbusters
May 9 2017,negative,about as bad as i expected this movie was slapped together half assed and it shows most of the jokes dont land it lacks care and continuity the running gags arent funny at all very forced   can we talk about the fact this movie spends the entire time basically shitting all over men im not kidding it was wildly unnecessary and just seemed like a severely bitter fuck you to guys for no reason i find it very distasteful  if the movie was actually funny i might let it slide but when you dosay bigoted things and youre not funny it doesnt come off as a joke it comes of as bigotry same goes for film and tv
May 8 2017,negative,this movie is crap that is all there is to it the plot is terrible and the dialogue is just god awful there is a reason that the user reviews for this film are not good and it has nothing to do with sexism i love the actors in this film but this is a terrible movie  this film has 74 because critics were afraid to review it objectively for fear of being labeled a sexist
May 8 2017,neutral,this was such a disappointment  main characters sucked cheesy overall
May 8 2017,positive,really dont understand peoples hate on this movie went to see it with my girlfriend and totally enjoyed it even found myself laughing out loud to a few scenes just dont compare it to the original classic and you wont be disappointed 
May 7 2017,positive,i liked the movie for the actresses and what seemed like a lot of improv very funny and i hope there will be a part 2
May 7 2017,positive,im just looking for a reasonable ratio of wontons to soup this is madness
May 7 2017,negative,this movie was heavily trolled before it came out i have to say i had a negative view as i loved the first ghostbusters it is still one of my top comedies ever but as hollywood must do take a great movie and put a different spin on it this time replace all the men with women hence the trolls also i now realize that the great critic reviews are the reverse of the trolls it is woman power so it is so funny and so good  but its not this is a flat boring and unfunny movie not just in comparison to the original but just as a movie by itself also how come they get to make all sorts of beauty jokes at a good looking guy but done in reverse would be panned by the critics      anyway simply an unfunny movie and a huge disappointment chalk one up for the trolls they were right for the wrong reason and critics drop the pretense and admit just a weak comedy that shouldnt have been made
May 6 2017,positive,great movie and funny
May 6 2017,positive,i really enjoyed this movie more so than the originals i like that this was about friendship between women and lacked bill murrays weird harassment of sigourney weaver so many other people rated this movie low because they are fanboys of the originals i like the originals i grew up watching the films but i thought this was an interesting fun and refreshing take on the story
May 6 2017,negative,how to combat sexism through sexism
May 3 2017,negative,its a decent movie for millennials who havent seen the 1985 film but this 2016 reboot is a disgrace to the franchise sony should have made an original property
May 3 2017,negative,the only reason i watched this is because the bad reviews peaked my curiosity i went in unprejudiced nevertheless but sadly this movie was worse than the bad reviews terrible movie never mind that it is a poor imitation calling it a remake would be too kind with none of the magic of the original films on its own this movie fell flat it just wasnt funny and the story was a huge yawn with loads of unnecessary dialog and tedious filler saying it was mediocre would be very generous praise this did nothing positive for feminism or inspiringempowering young women just the opposite in fact words like cliche stereotypes thirdrate and uninspired come to mind of course young people will enjoy this they dont know any better if this is whats being offered to a new generation do them a favor and let them watch the originals
May 2 2017,negative,this film passes the bechdel test but is filled with racist sexist and intellectual stereotypes that are very offensive this includes mostly any foremost the main characters and also the cameo appearances which puts this issue center and foremost  the film was also filled with toilet humor which seems to be made for 6 year olds the special effects and the storyline was ok but isnt a reason to give this crap a better rating
May 2 2017,positive,wish i wouldve watched it in theaters
May 1 2017,neutral,this was better than i was expecting tho im still not sure why they decided to make it in the first place the cast do a good job tho hemsworths character is a little pointless the end battle with the ghosts and the posessed carnival float characters was shaping up really nicely until they decided to ruin it by pretty much copying the first film with the giant ghost
Apr 29 2017,positive,funniest movie our family has seen in ages
Apr 29 2017,negative,completely unnecessary and waste of time  countless missed cued and bad jokes  gets a half star on account of the special effects and bad cameos
Apr 27 2017,positive,it ends very strong
Apr 26 2017,negative,some good humor but other than that just plain bad
Apr 25 2017,negative,unfunny uninspired disrespectful to fans of the original film to males heck even to women and their braincells also has the look of any blockbuster currently this is formulaic drivel at its best come again sony with something original please
Apr 25 2017,negative,the movie is not entertaining in any form or way the comedy is cringeworthy and is essentially a rehash of everything the first movie did whilst failing miserably in its execution    and you know what thats okay the original was great and there is very little one could do to match it the actors are devoid of any charisma and even thehe stupid gimmicks they do licking their guns did not make me laugh even once during the movie    not to mention the clear pathetic girl power message it has attempted to play off by replacing the cast with women the movie aimed to be progressive making all the women talented scientists and engineers  whilst also making the black women the one who knows the streets and doesnt know anything about science brilliant    i wouldnt recommend this movie to my greatest enemy this is like the room without any of the entertaining value
Apr 24 2017,negative,besides all the man shaming it was okay
Apr 24 2017,negative,no actorsactresses could have ever made up for such terrible writing and directing the rave color palette didnt help
Apr 23 2017,negative,awful acting fine just so bad we barely laughed twice almost fell asleep the cgi sequences toward the end were good but you didnt care because the storyline set them up so badly a shame
Apr 20 2017,negative,it might have been good hadnt there already have been a hilarious classic that already did it trying to recreate this movie was a mistake and i am pretty sure they now know it considering this movie bombed
Apr 17 2017,positive,love this movie honestly better than the original
Apr 17 2017,positive,this movie is absolutely amazingi hate all the hate its getting i saw it twice in theaters watched the extended edition bought the movie got a shirt and bought the action figures i love that they flipped stereotypes on their heads and gave it an awesome new twist while still sticking a bit to the original also it makes all the sexists cry as a plusthis movie really should have a higher rating
Apr 17 2017,negative,there were good parts that got quickly shot down by bad parts
Apr 15 2017,positive,is the reboot of ghostbusters the greatest comedy ever hell no does it have problems oh absolutely the cgi is horrible and some jokes fall flat however the chemistry of the actresses more than some of the jokes do land and the variety of the action kicks ass even if you didnt like it there were clearly worse movies in 2016    810
Apr 15 2017,positive,never cared for the original movie  this was an alright remake  it did feel a bit preachy though
Apr 14 2017,positive,it was so much fun watched with the family we were rolling the whole movie
Apr 14 2017,negative,such wasted potential way too cringy
Apr 14 2017,positive,amazing best movie ever really funny great characters relatable scenes and its still has the old cast in it somewhere its not too inappropriate for kids and not too sweary for a 12 rated movie  on a scale of 1 to 10 i would personally rate ghostbusters a 12
Apr 14 2017,negative,made it halfway through and couldnt watch anymore terrible
Apr 13 2017,positive,the 2016 female led remake of ghostbusters is better than its controversy would indicate melissa mccarthy kristen wiig kate mckinnon and leslie jones have great chemistry on screen together and there are some very funny moments from them all and chis hemsworth is hilarious as their dumbaspaint himbo receptionist
Apr 12 2017,positive,ghostbusters 1984 was my favourite movie during high school apart from stop making sense also 1984  so it was with some trepidation that i approached this remakeremodel  luckily i am pleased to be able to say that this new version manages to maintain the tone of the original genial silly and amusing with enough special effects and pop music to keep it moving along  as with the force awakens 2015 the original plot of the earlier film is used only schematically such that the points of connection provide aha moments for those who recalledloved the earlier films  this version of ghostbusters also features cameos by many of the original cast members albeit in different roles including slimer the only one who maintains his same character i guess  of course the big new thing in this film is that the ghostbusters are all women this change only slightly changes the dynamic  there is a natural camaraderiebanter between kristen wiig and melissa mccarthy  and kate mckinnon playing weirdnerdscientist and leslie jones round out the team with their more offbeatstereotypical characters  i felt they earned the right to be ghostbusters just as much as murray aykroyd ramis and hudson before them moreover the plot while perhaps more disposable than the one used in 1984 was perfectly satisfactory as a container to hold these characters and their shenanigans  it is hard to get these sorts of actioncomedyblockbusters right let alone with the pressure to live up to a cherished forerunner  kudos to director paul feig and his team  thumbs up from me
Apr 10 2017,negative,the second most patetic and boring movie i ever seen in my life just next to kirk camerons whatever xmas  i really dont know were to start   horrible acting overacting   boringlazy script   not funny at all   we had a retarded secretary that its no so retarded to dress like a fashion hippster and hit the gym everyday non sense   great fx  if u suffer from sleeping problems just play ghostbusters 2016 and problem solve no need for prescriptions  i will love to read what really think bill murray dan aykroyd harold ramis rick moranis ivan reitman about this movie  worst remake ever
Apr 9 2017,positive,pretty funny movie but not very good story linenever as good as the original
Apr 9 2017,positive,not as bad as people is saying it is not great
Apr 9 2017,positive,good effort when a remake was not needed some nice cameos
Apr 7 2017,positive,for what it was i really enjoyed this film not just because it was one of very few occasiogns i got to sit with my eldest 10 year old daughter and watch a film from start to finish  it was good fun humorous and most certainly did not take itself seriouslyit was obviously meant to be a ptake of a movie and not a serious edgy scifii thouroughly enjoyed the nostalgia of the original casts cameo appearances  thankfully they sidestepped the land mine of making it similar to either of the originals but paid genuine homage to the wacky film we loved all those years ago  i do think a sequel would be a step too far though
Apr 4 2017,negative,dont bother watching just put the original in the dvd player and enjoy
Apr 4 2017,positive,ive never seen the original movies so im just judging this by the quality of the film alone and i must say this is a fun blockbuster love the part when all ghost invade the city and thought chris hemsworth was hilarious in the role of alex the only negative was that at times i found leslie jones to be annoying
Apr 1 2017,positive,my family and i loved this movie  maybe even more than the original 
Apr 1 2017,positive,i should have listened to my heart because this movie was way better than people were giving it credit for  the cameos were funny the female cast were hilarious  going to purchase the movie next
Mar 31 2017,positive,not as good as the original but still good in its own right nice twist on the series i enjoyed it
Mar 30 2017,positive,it is watchable but a better plot would have made it better
Mar 30 2017,negative,ugh unnecessary reboot that is boring and doesnt have many laughs
Mar 29 2017,negative,shallow fairly blatant female perspective sexist plot the premovie sexist allegations of male reviewers was clearly planned by sony as it is alluded to twice in the movie itself many elements in this movie were satisfactory but the storytelling was lost in the apparent 3rd gen feminist political message i can only imagine people giving this a higher score if they have not seen the original 1984 classic of the same name
Mar 29 2017,negative,easily one of the worst movies ive ever seen the comedy is forced and fake the obligatory cameos are awkward chris hemsworth is the only one that seems to be having fun
Mar 28 2017,negative,they took a good cast with usually good chemistry see snl and somehow made them clunky and unfunny had this been done differently it might have been an enjoyable movie instead its a bland popcorn flick with few laughs and even fewer fun moments
Mar 27 2017,negative,pretty weak reminds me of a pre teen movie
Mar 27 2017,negative,i laughed when i saw who they were casting for this movie im not laughing now
Mar 27 2017,negative,this movie lacks any intelligence behind it the plot is cliche and predictable and attempts to please fans of the franchise with poor and uninspired imitation the characters are hollow and unrealistic and despite being scientists will say or do something unbelievable stupid at some point in the movie this is not too far from watching a recent adam sandler movie where the efforts in comedy are so low even a submarine wouldnt be enough to reach its depths the ending that people convienently ignore is the typical similar scenario as suicide squad and many recent superhero movies of which the same critics gave unforgivening comments about there are some good jokes in this movie like the ghosts on the subway line but there are far more bad jokes like the cat in a bag it makes me curious if this is the first time the writers have written a comedy film because most of the time the jokes just fall flat and the timing drags out awkwardly if this movie was its own property i would still not concider seeing this movie after seeing the trailer i would still concider it to be a cheap cash grab that has no soul or inspiration the same way that alot of the transformer or fast and furious movies are made more for the specacle and sales then for the idea i concider a lot of movies with that intent as poorly contrived the cast wasnt bad with better writting this group of women could have pulled off a good team but its awfully shameful when a lot of critics are giving what they called an ok movie a far superior rating to a similar movie with the not as many issues a rotten rating rotten tomatos in deed
Mar 27 2017,positive,not know what to expect  staying away from all commercials i just flat out liked it    so much so i find myself wanting to watch it again  again
Mar 27 2017,neutral,even though i did not hate it and i came into it really wanting to like it it left me a bit confused i like what its trying to do and they are a couple of funny moments but the execution is lacking
Mar 25 2017,negative,if i could i would give it 05
Mar 25 2017,negative,chris hemsworth makes it nothing else
Mar 25 2017,negative,this is an okay movie about fighting ghosts  but it makes a terrible ghostbusters movie especially if its expected to be a reboot of the series  i can see why everyone has stopped talking about it not even a year after its release
Mar 24 2017,positive,more ghostbusting action than its predecessors and i didnt hate the characters chris hemsworth stole the show with his goofy idiot schtick
Mar 23 2017,positive,ghostbusters 2016 directed by paul feig and starring melissa mccarthy kristen wiig leslie jones kate mckinnon  watch this if you like paul feig and mccarthys movie collaborations bridesmaid heat spy scooby doo movies  it is a good and technically competent movie but it could have been so much better  it is a reboot of the old 1984 ghostbusters movie about 4 women banding together and fighting ghosts with their scientific equipment in new york  the chemistry between the four leads are great and engaging and it is refreshing to see a movie which portrays women as the strong and main characters  the graphics are ok but it is intentionally campy similar to the graphics in the scooby doo movies so some people might hate it  i find the comedy to be adequate with some laughoutloud moments but the comedy is a bit uneven and too improvisational and flat at times my theatre buddies only chuckled here and there  the plot is sadly too simple the villain is kinda cliched and for a movie which puts women in a strong light laudable since so many movies are too mencentricthe movie portrays all male characters as dumbegotisticalso some people might not agree with this  overall ghostbusters is a good movie but i cant help but expecting a more excellent movie because of the talents assembled here   a missed opportunity  a b
Mar 23 2017,negative,awful awful awful there are no words for how awful this really is
Mar 23 2017,positive,i was really looking forward to this being a fan of the originals plus paul feig knows how produce some very funny films as seen with bridesmaids and the heat i thought this would be a winner  it turned out to be ok  there were some laughs the special effects were decent but it just didnt have the scares or the heart of the originals  sigourney weavers transformation in the old films terrified me at the time and the solution to defeat the evil turned out to be such a simple thing as people being nice to each other was just magical but this new version was lacking anything that would have me return i also felt chris hemsworths role was pointless and the character just came across as irritating i enjoyed the references to the original films and it was a nice touch to have the original cast cameo in the movie plus there was a decent tribute to harold ramis  worth seeing if youre a fan of the franchise for something different but its the originals you will continue to return to
Mar 22 2017,negative,seldom funny often cringeworthy bottomofthebarrel comedy with some impressive special effects wasted on a tasteless script
Mar 22 2017,negative,really poor script and acting is bad real letdown casting also not great
Mar 22 2017,negative,let me start by saying this is the first time i have ever be so appalled that i have created an account to review anything  this movie was complete garbage the best parts were the first 20 min and the credit scenes  i heardread all the bad reviews and i really wanted them to be exaggerated sadly they were spot on    the short comings of this movie cant be put on the actresses they did the best job the could with a director that has no business being in the genre of film and an even worse script shame on any of the original ghostbusters who approved this    throughout the entire movie i was left feeling confused are they trying to be set in the modern era or are they trying to be in the 80s  that huge lack of direction aside the rest of the film was just the premise of ghostbusters 1 mashed together with ghosterbusters 2 swap the gender roles and thanks for killing the franchise
Mar 22 2017,negative,lazy writing bad jokes a comedy lacking in all the intelligence of the original
Mar 22 2017,negative,this movie doesnt address the sexist issue it revels in it and is filled with stereotypes and unfunny jokes watch the original instead
Mar 20 2017,negative,takes the ghostbusters license and destroys it no respect for the source material bythenumbers 21st century comedy with a ghostbusters skin and this film does not need to exist absolute waste of time
Mar 20 2017,neutral,all the living members of the original classic get a cameo in this film presumably to boost its presence amongst older members of its audience  its not a straight copy of the 1984 film but the blueprint has certainly been xeroxed  its hard to make an equal let alone a better version of the first film and in this respect it falls flat on its face
Mar 20 2017,negative,one of the worst remakes i have ever seen  straight to the point not going to sugar coat this mess  forced jokes  dull action  cgi that looks ten years old  basic rehash of the first ghostbusters storyline and above all else just boring     how this film is certified fresh just proves  how out of touch the critics truly are   skip this and go watch the originals you arnt missing anything here      who you gonna call  someone else
Mar 19 2017,positive,decent  battery then expected  but not great
Mar 19 2017,negative,comedy depends on timing and wit this movie has neither two of the leads have some talent but they never gel instead they compete with one another chris hemsworth actually outshines them all in terms of individual performance this is unfortunate since his character is only supposed to be in support a touch of mean spiritedness heh heh also dampens the fun unlike the 1984 versions charm and heart dont waste your time watch the original again instead
Mar 19 2017,positive,boy the internet sure had a field day with this one prior to its release didnt they  whether it was diehard fans of the original 1984 movie viewers of the films first trailer or the ugly misogynists of the world the online world was set ablaze by word that paul feig was going to helm a femaledriven reboot of ivan reitmans comedy classic     at the time i marveled at this giant overreaction and now after seeing the film myself it looks even more overblown in hindsight  ghostbusters is nothing to get worked up over on either end of the spectrum  its not very good but its not awful either  its just a lightweight middleoftheroad mediocre comedy  it deserves neither adulation nor vitriol     just to clarify i didnt really have a strong opinion about a ghostbusters reboot  im a fan of the original movie but i dont revere it as so many others in my age group do  this was not seen as a sacrilege in my eyes     now its true that generally speaking i feel like the movie market has been oversaturated with remakes and reboots over the past few years and ill usually approach them with some degree of trepidation  but the truth is that it doesnt appear that the remakereboot trend is going to end any time soon  and sometimes you may even end up pleasantly surprised  i actually liked the total recall remake something i definitely didnt anticipate     plus despite what terrible internet people might claim creating a female team of spookhunters was inherently a good thing  growing up in the 80s and 90s most young boys i knew had a favorite ghostbuster  is it really so terrible that now young girls of this generation can look at this squad and feel like they can play too  this isnt to suggest that the girls of the 80s didnt like ghostbusters or have a favorite character but at least now their gender is better represented beyond love interest or damsel in distress     so it wouldve been a pleasant surprise had ghostbusters 2016 won me over  the four leads kristen wiig melissa mccarthy leslie jones and kate mckinnon have all been good in other projects and have great comedic chemistry  and there are some funny moments in the movie jones in particular is a hoot and i also enjoyed chris hemsworths turn as the teams mimbo secretary     but much of the film is just flat  the humor is too scattershot and the story isnt interesting enough to carry the proceedings when the comedy lags  the plot is moreorless the same as the original filma team of paranormal experts unite to save new york city from a sudden mysterious plague of angry spiritsbut the concept is no longer as fresh and the special effects packed more of a visceral wallop back then     to be clear the effects are better in the current movie as technology has obviously improved  but there was a certain creepiness to the 84 films ghouls that this one lacks  with all the bright swirling colors they just dont seem all that scary  i know that its not meant to be a horror movie but the ghosts still need to have an element of danger to them they need to be busted after all  in the original movie the stay puft marshallow man while not outright scary at least came off as something of a threat  i never got that sense with any of the phantasms in this remake     that extends to the villain too whos just a little weenypants mad scientist intent on unleashing as many ghosts on the city as he can  gozer the gozerian this guy aint     the original ghostbusters turn up in cameo roles save for the late harold ramis obviously but bill murrays appearance is the only one thats actually noteworthy as hes essentially playing the asshole character he squared off against in the 84 film  ernie hudsons walkon is cute but unnecessary and dan aykroyds is just plain bad     i wanted to like this movie  i like the cast and it wouldve just been so poetic had feig made a dynamic ghostbusters reboot to silence the internets frothing rage that had mostly surfaced before the damn thing had even come out  and as i said theres nothing terrible about the film and its never unwatchable  but it doesnt leave much of a positive impact either  at the end of the day ghostbusters is going to be remembered more for the uproar it became embroiled in rather than the content of the film itself  and thats too bad for a number of reasons
Mar 18 2017,negative,2 stars an i feel guilty giving it that
Mar 18 2017,negative,was ok until the last 30 minutes  that sucked big time
Mar 18 2017,negative,worst remake i have ever seen and i watch anything once this spoils the originals even though the actors are great in other films terrible
Mar 17 2017,negative,just awful story poor and characters plagued by pitiful dialogue
Mar 17 2017,negative,the only good part are the camios by the old ghostbusters
Mar 17 2017,negative,as av reboot its shameful as a sequel its nonsensical and idiotic
Mar 15 2017,negative,to anyone who has a love for the original movie from their childhood teens or early 20s youre probably going to dislike this remake  it was painful for my fiancã and i to watch  i normally love melissa mccarthy but even with her involvement this flick is not funny it has huge gaps in the plot what a mess
Mar 13 2017,positive,absolutely adored this flick     as a fan of the originals the reboot holds its own     the cast has great chemistry and while its a fantastic ensemble piece mckinnon has some absolutely standout scenes as does jones
Mar 13 2017,positive,great reboot with a better story than the original and fabulous characters loved it more than i thought i would
Mar 13 2017,negative,i cant believe the critics gave this such a high score i may have laughed once it was truly truly awful im sad to say i no longer trust rotten tomatoes for reviews
Mar 12 2017,positive,i thought the movie was ok but my little cousin thats 5 litterally over obsessive compulsive over this movie because he loves all thing ghostbusters
Mar 12 2017,positive,better than most reboots nice to see intelligent funny and strong female leads kickin ghost butts so happy that i can share this movie with my daughter in a few years the cameos from the original cast were cute
Mar 12 2017,negative,ugh  this was painful to watch at times and funny at the times overall a miss glad we watched this on cable because id be miffed if i paid to see this in the theater
Mar 12 2017,negative,why does this exist
Mar 12 2017,positive,while not a perfect movie it does have very funny moment the chemistry between the four women is amazing holtzmann mckinnon is the stand out with chris hemsworth a close second
Mar 11 2017,negative,this movie is a piece of crap
Mar 8 2017,positive,thore was so hot but soooooo annoying the 3 starts is for the women
Mar 8 2017,negative,ghostbusters 2016 might have some good laughs cool special effects and a decent casting with kristen wiig melissa mccarthy kate mckinnon  leslie jones but it did not came up very strong as the 1st ghostbusters film did with a dry  weak humor nonmenacing and bland villain dumb 2nd half convoluted story and horrendous pacing
Mar 8 2017,positive,way better than i thought it would be
Mar 8 2017,positive,a lot of the attempts at comedy fall flat and the references to the original do more than just distract from what does genuinely work hereand thats a lot the cast have real chemistry the story is livelier than it has any right to be and it does a fantastic job at always upping the action from set piece to set piece this aint a classic  but its heaps of fun props to mckinnon for stealing the show
Mar 7 2017,positive,i loved the giant ghost
Mar 6 2017,positive,i wound up hearing  all the negative reviews for it and expected far worse but what i got was fairly enjoyable and i love the strong female leads erin is a weak character which sucks cause she is the lead mostly but patty and holtzmann are beyond hilarious when the movie does its own thing it works the original movie refrences occassionally fall flat  but overall i loved this movie
Mar 6 2017,positive,truly enjoyable this was more of an snl movie despite not being labelled as an snl movie the cast worked very well together and they made sure to give kudos to the original while still maintaining their own voice kate mckinnon was by far the star of this movie but the others made the movie entertaining hopefully a sequel is made and people give it a chance instead of bashing it simply for employing women in the titular roles or daring to be different from the original
Mar 5 2017,negative,i love the cast based on other work and really wanted this movie to be good or at least funny but it was downright unwatchable it didnt even seem professionally made  more like a long bad snl skit piss poor special effects and terrible choppy editing cant believe anyone gave this movie more than one stars wow what a complete disgrace
Mar 5 2017,negative,i seriously hope this doesnt get a sequel all they had to do was make the original ghostbusters too old and have their kids take their places men and women it didnt have to be all women it felt forced and the jokes just didnt make me laugh the cgi was terrible as well
Mar 5 2017,positive,good movie spoiled by extreme misandry  dont get me wrong it was funny throughout especially kate mckinnon who is probably on her way to hollywood superstardom but the manhate was so thick you could cut it with a knife it would have been fine with kevin character being the neanderthal of the movie but to have every male character written in a negative way just detracts from the movie not to mention the heavy handed symbolism of shooting the villain in the groin and a nutcracker device in the end credits
Mar 4 2017,positive,i enjoyed this remake of the original 1984 film in fact i like it more the cast is fantastic and i laughed a lot more i dont understand why people seem to hate it so much
Mar 4 2017,positive,it has the production value and a talented cast the writing was lacking the characters were severely underwritten and functioned as talking memes i was more interested in the science than the jokes which werent landing it also seemed to be overcompensating in its feminist tone its sad to see that it had the infrastructure but lacked the foundation of a strong script to make it a great movie
Mar 4 2017,negative,i laughed once near the end when the mayor was being interviewed and someone yelled baba booey  best things cecily strong as city hall suck up chris hemsworth cuz hes who he is thats about it pointless top to bottom waste of real comic talent i blew up a new yoga ball while i was watching it and looked at it with more admiration
Mar 4 2017,negative,just horrific i wanted to like it but it was as bad as everyone said the ghosts were boring pretty graphics with great lighting nothing was funny and i have to agree they were terrible in their roles at one point they are running away from a collapse and you know as slow as they are running that they couldnt move 10 feet in the time it took that mess to fall i think the script was a mess i like most of those actors in other films this just didnt work
Mar 4 2017,positive,not bad  they pretty much take everything about ghostbusters and replace it with their feminine counterparts its not quite as funny as the original  but the psycho blond girl is a trip to watch
Mar 3 2017,positive,it would be a five star review if i didnt know about the original  because i do know about the original i found myself comparing the two movies  this one is really good but the original is a classic  so it loses half a star  still well worth your time
Mar 2 2017,negative,the fantastic blend of women and the exact same script of the first ghostbusters movie makes the film feel better it had  rubbish joke and lake of chemistry i would rather drink bleach then watch another second of the film 1010
Feb 27 2017,positive,better than i thought it would be
Feb 27 2017,negative,absolute garbage i dont know what demographic this movie is trying to appeal to but they did a horrific job
Feb 26 2017,positive,they perfectly recaptured the magic i enjoyed when i saw the original all those years ago great great job they even managed to mix in the original cast including a bust of ramis near the beginning of the film the only original cast member missing was moranis who turned the project down
Feb 26 2017,positive,i loved this movie personally id watch this over the original any day of the week
Feb 26 2017,negative,a average movie did they really have to remake it though why not have them open a frachise ghostbuster spot in a different city and go from there just missing that gives them a point lower on the scale
Feb 26 2017,neutral,it was ok i didnt want to kill myself i also didnt really laugh
Feb 25 2017,negative,terrible 1 of the stars is for the special effects
Feb 25 2017,negative,i swore i would not watch this movie but i did anyway i would happier with someone i know just telling that they seen it and was good than to have watched and know how horrible it was this plot is basically a mesh of the first 2 movies plot with many scenes being strait yp poorley done carbon copies i regret that i gave this a chance even the 2009 ghostbusters the video game voiced by the origanl cast minus rick moranis was a 100 times better than this movies and trust me its true
Feb 25 2017,negative,pile of shit just imagine a really bad snl skit that goes on for 2 hours how did the critics give this 73 maybe they watched the original by mistake skip it seriously
Feb 25 2017,positive,i enjoyed watching it  i hope to see more
Feb 24 2017,positive,even better than the original tons of excitement and very big laughs from start to finish
Feb 23 2017,negative,a movie which was lackluster for large portions with fleeting funny moments unhelped by an unoriginal plot and poor cgi
Feb 22 2017,positive,this movie has its ups and its downs the up side is that the cast is marvelous i loved both kate mckinnon and neil casey in this they did a marvelous job  and the ghostbusting gadgets they use look badass i especially love the design of the new proton pack the downside of this film is the poorly rendered cgi ghost every time a ghost appears on screen i cant tell if im watching a ghostbusters film or a live action scooby doo movie some of the dialogue and jokes were either cringe worthy or felt very forced also i dont think leslie jones was the right actress to be in this film her character came off as an annoying black lady stereotype this movie wasnt that good as some critics claim it is or that bad as the youtube comment section of the trailer for this movie claim it is its just decent movie not good not bad just nothing but harmless fun and somewhat of a good little homage to the classic 1984 original
Feb 22 2017,positive,haunted by a third act so bloated it almost derails what was up until that point a fine comedy
Feb 22 2017,positive,the script was pretty bad yet the effects and action was absolutely awesome great cast and terrific cameos
Feb 21 2017,negative,there has been so much said in both the lead up and aftermath of the release of ghostbusters paul feigs female orientated redoing of the beloved 1980s comedy property that it feels as though theres almost nothing else to be said about it    regardless of all that has been said both from the haters who get mentions here those on the fence and those that have found this reimagining to be the entertaining comedy rush they wanted this 2016 version of a bunch of ghost hunting misfits patrolling new york city as a collection of nasty ghouls run amok is neither humorous enough engaging enough or even imaginative enough to even be held up to the high flying original released in 1984 nor the rather soso sequel from 1989    falling into the recent traps of modern day big budgeted events the biggest problem ghostbusters encounters is creating a decent story which isnt even worth talking about and with the film neither being a direct sequel or a remake feig and his cowriter katie dippold have created a rather uninspiring plotline that throws our talented female cast into a world of green slime and celebrity cameos but forgets to engage us along for the ride    a majority of the films laughs come from either jokes made at the expense or remembrance of the old films or from chris hemsworths dimwitted office clerk kevin while the cast whove all plied their trades in various comedy enterprises over the year struggle in what was likely a case of the studio holding back their rather bizarre antics in hope of keeping the film as pg as possible for the widest audience available    its a shame the cast werent given total free reign to take this material somewhere new and exciting as its not enough to just change the demographic from male to female orientation and while its refreshing to see melissa mccarthy be dialled back a notch or two after a string of adhd like performances she fails to make a mark while wiig and snls kate mckinnon get short shrift leaving the films last big four member leslie jones to take up slack with her loud mouthed patty tolan taking home the teams major wins    at the end of the day it feels as though this repainted ghostbusters was neither a film many wanted or called out for and failed to show any of the haters wrong with a film that is neither a win in the comedy stakes the originality stakes or the entertainment stakes    whilst perhaps not as bad as many feared ghostbusters biggest crime is a waste of a readymade brand name in its creation of a film that is instantly forgettable something that was never the case when we first called the ghostbusters all those years ago    2 cans of pringles out of 5    
Feb 21 2017,negative,intrigued when announceddisappointed when i saw bad chemistry toilet humor that makes epic movie look like a golden globe nominated film for best comedy 2 queef jokes within the first 20 mins seriously film makes up its rules as it goes cameos only thing done well or at most of them
Feb 20 2017,positive,better than the old one
Feb 19 2017,positive,there were some really funny parts in this movie but it just wasnt enough though im not sure if im still stuck in my childhood memories or if it is just because this movie has better special effects but i didnt enjoy this as much as i thought i would i  might watch it again
Feb 19 2017,negative,so bad i turned it off before the ending
Feb 19 2017,positive,i know this got quite a bit of bad press but quite liked it not a classic like the original but entertaining enough and by no means an embarrassment
Feb 19 2017,negative,being a fan of the original 2 ghostbusters and one of the many fans who where looking forward to the ghostbusters 3 after announcement i eventually had to see this having just finished watching i feel strong enough to rate this abomination the movie seems to lack focus with examples like 1 of the ghostbusters arguing with who i assume to be her boyfriend but instead of following that as a way of character development it then follows 2 of the ghostbusters theorizing about how he dances items like this in the movie in my opinion overshadow the jokes that do land and there would have been more than a few except that as stated the way the movie is shot it seems to take all focus away from the story and the good jokes i was even more disappointed by this movie than i expected as the way it had been spun it was all bad and it wasnt the bad parts simply overshadowed the good disappointing all round movie
Feb 18 2017,positive,im surprised some did not like this movie whats not to like i felt it was true to the original but was updated for now it was just as good as the original great family movie just like i remember as a kid
Feb 18 2017,negative,this movie is bad  really bad i mean really bad
Feb 18 2017,negative,this is  really boring movie not worth watching there were a few minor humerous moments but nothing memorable my main reason for writing a review is after seeing how an awfully dull movie like this can get 73 and yet other cult movies that were really funny like step brothers and pineapple express have much lower percentages i find it strange that anyone who is not an utter moron could be leaving this movie 5 stars is it not strange to anyone that when you click on the majority of 5 star reviews that those accounts now no longer exist and you can see that persons information ie unavailable therefore i expect that someone involved in giving these awful movies good publicity are purposesfully making fake accounts for giving 5 stars to their movies therefore for this to be allowed makes a mockery of rotten tomatoes and means the percentages can never truly be trusted i dont think i could ever speak to someone who gave this movie 5 stars they are obviously imbeciles  the problem with this movie wasnt the female actors they are all kinda good actresses and funny the problem was with virtually everything else but also the original ghostbusters movie also original star wars was so good because the original cast had something more than just good acting they had something special that make those movies not just kinda funny but really funny lets take the original ghostbusters movie think if it had been exactly the same in every way except for instead of having bill murray as the main character imagine that adam sandler had played this role would it have been a good movie the answer is no take out something special like bill murray and the movie is doomed to failure star wars and ghostbusters etc etc were so good because of their special actors this remake had no chance of ever being a 5 star movie but it could have been a 3 star movie but it failed in every way anyone who thinks this movie is 5 stars please remove yourself from the gene pool immediately you are doing the human race a disservice
Feb 16 2017,negative,just got done watching this one i didnt care for all the conversation about it being sexist or all the noise that came with this movie so my wife and i decided to watch it whenever it would be released on tv after its all settled so we did and we both came to the same conclusion which was it was not a good film     my wife just didnt laugh and said it felt like she was watching the scooby doo movie for me i dont care about special effects as much as the storyplot i couldnt stand the plot of this film bc i didnt feel like the villain was imposing nor did i really understand what his motivations really were or why the ghosts all of a sudden went schizo also i dont get mr stay puff because that was something ray was thinking which lead to an omg moment in the original i was hoping they wouldve done something original with that maybe a new mascot that one of them thinks up     in the end we just didnt like it we both liked mckinnons character but not much else
Feb 16 2017,positive,man i love this movie its not as good as the original but its still a giant funny movie but the villain was so bad but the 4 busters were great
Feb 15 2017,negative,new one uh no i rented it and it was too unoriginal
Feb 14 2017,negative,this movie is trash its hard to support movies that rely on cheap effects and bad humor to try to copy how amazing the original ghostbuster films were
Feb 14 2017,positive,question who ya gonna call   answer the original ghostbusters to be honest
Feb 14 2017,negative,this movie was a let down from the beginning from such a memorable franchise with big jokes involving a guy constantly flipping off the lead and  how they tried to get laughs out of a fart joke shows how kevin feige tried to make this movie good but i will give it credit the fight scenes werent bad and despite how heavy the cgi was for this film the ghosts didnt look that bad and the scene with the dragon ghost had a few good jokes in it but at the end ghostbusters 2016 was an ok movie that will end up being forgotten about in a few years
Feb 14 2017,neutral,no matter how many sex jokes it cant save an attempt to revive a series of good films i had to stop about 34 quarters through i just cant stand it
Feb 14 2017,negative,nearly no chemistry and horrible  screenplay these great actresses do everything to try to elevate the material but the material is mostly unfunny i kept questioning its own existence wondering how another paul feig and melissa mccarthy match up past ones include bridesmaids the heat spy could go so wrong  if you want to watch a film to prove womens excellent comedy skills i implore you to watch bridesmaids or spy theyre both fantastic  d
Feb 14 2017,negative,some movies are a one off or in the case of their sequels  a two three  four or five off  etback to the future jaws etc and in my opinion should never be redone to protect the happy memories of the originals it was therefore with extreme caution that i approached paul feigs all female except for the scene stealing chris hemsworth ghostbusters remake was this trepidation justified on the whole yes it was  feig deserves great kudos for attempting this remake in the first place replacing the original cast and attempting an original take on the tale itself throwing in the odd enjoyable cameo was no easy task and for the most part he almost but not quite pulls it off  there is a lot to like about this movie it is most definitely not lacking in the effects department the cast do the best with the roles they are given with the expecption of snls kate mckinnon whos character is so slapstickingly annoying that she becomes tiresome after all off about 30 seconds you have been warned  there are enough gags and visual surprises along the way to keep you engaged but this falls under the see in in the cinema category as the story is not strong or engaging enough to hold up on dvd release  overall a gallant effort that fails to hit the heights yet doesnt scar the memories of the original but please put the 80s classics remakes on the back burner for a little while longer what gremlins jumanji commando and war games remakes on the way come on hollywood
Feb 13 2017,neutral,first of all i think this film was unfairly prejudged for being rebooted with an allfemale cast  its a little shocking how so many haters came out railing against it  with that said i was disappointed the quality didnt measure up to the originals  it just wasnt as fun or funny as it could have been
Feb 13 2017,negative,funniest thing in this mess was the number of wontons in the soup maybe the only funny thing
Feb 12 2017,negative,why just why  i stooped watching  prime example why classics should not be remade
Feb 11 2017,negative,its never good when you watch a comedy and only laugh once i may be in the minority but i just dont find mccarthy and wiig very funny in their movies unfortunately this movie just wasnt that good they did a nice job with the cameos
Feb 11 2017,negative,i usually like melissa mccarthy but i think she just killed a franchise
Feb 11 2017,positive,i know i saw this movie with my buddy greg when it came out and im certain we both hated it i just finished watching at home with the carla and the kids and we couldnt stop laughing i think the first time around greg and i were like the two old guys from the muppets finding faults for the sake of finding faults it couldnt possibly be as the original we said then but for me on the second time around it was in fact i really enjoyed the funny bits and outtakes during the credits above all else i enjoyed watching this movie and knowing that the magic of movies will always keep us connected to greg
Feb 11 2017,negative,it was decent minus all the male shaming
Feb 11 2017,positive,haters are gonna hate but this movie was delightful entertaining
Feb 11 2017,positive,010217 i never paid much attention to the old ones and this had some solid laughs  the engineering girl from snl i thought initially was trying to hard then she was my favorite after 15 min through the end
Feb 10 2017,negative,ghostbusters should not be associated with this film a literal fart joke and tweeting middle fingersi was done harold ramis has to be trying to reach us from the other side as this is just a sad money grab by sony pictures shame on them for green lighting this atrocitie and shame on the cast for brining themselves to that level no problem with the all woman castthe film was executed for a dumbed down group of people that cant possibly be expected to think about what might be funny just a horrid and sad thing to exist in film
Feb 10 2017,positive,the original was so fresh and funny and this had some good lines and gags but i think they could have tried harder to not go overboard with the 21st century effects and focused more on the comedy that made the original a classic
Feb 10 2017,positive,entertaining main cast are girls from snl and cameos by the original cast
Feb 10 2017,negative,what a horrible movie i wanted to really likelove this movie but its down right one of the worst movies ive ever seen im actually typing this while its not even finished yet that how much it has my attention its painful to watch and it cant end fast enough the super cheesy one liners the poor movie props and the trying too hard to be funny just isnt working even with the good actors that are in this film the plot and cheap corniness of this movie just dont make it happen im completely bothered that the remake of this film was wasted on this junk now that youve wasted this opportunity to make this into something special well never get the opportunity where real movie makers will take the time to redo this film like it should be  thanks for spoiling that for us probably for ever
Feb 9 2017,negative,this is right up there with point break total recall and terminator genesis on the mount rushmore of unnecessary remakes and im ashamed of myself for watching this dreck i feel like a kid at fat camp who got caught eating an entire tub of cookie dough
Feb 7 2017,negative,horrible dont waste you time
Feb 7 2017,positive,it had some moments still love me sone melissa mccarthy and the other one with the blind lol blond hair makes me laugh
Feb 6 2017,neutral,the movie look good but the story was lame compared to the original disappointing im a ghostbusters fan
Feb 6 2017,positive,mildly stupid like the original ghostbusters yet incredibly hilarious with an snl filled cast
Feb 6 2017,positive,loved it i hope they do a sequel the all female cast with chris h and cameos from original ghostbusters was perfect im a fan of the original ghostbusters and now this version the female cast was an awesome take on this movie it was a fun movie
Feb 6 2017,positive,an underrated comedy
Feb 6 2017,negative,it really sucked i tried to give it a chance but it just didnt do it for me hopefully another remake in place
Feb 5 2017,positive,made me laugh they did a good job
Feb 5 2017,positive,it is interesting to note the discrepancy between user reviews and critical reviews for this film while i agree that as a comedy the film lacked a certain excitement i wonder just how many of the negative reviews both user and critical were informed by the films genderswitch it seems that when this shift is made in a comedy in particular the film just cant seem to live up to other films of the same style that are cast with men is it the jokes themselves that arent funny or the fact that women are delivering them are the standards for female comedy just that much higher i would argue yes in this case in particular while ghostbusters wasnt the funniest movie ive seen in recent years i do think it is deserving of more than a 53 user rating even if many argue that it its low rating comes mostly from its failure to compare to its original to that i might say that the original carries with it a legacy of maledominated comedy and expectation that cannot be ignored nevertheless i do think it will take more than this one reboot to entirely shift this gendered genre systemperhaps in the future femaleled films with original storylines and characters not interested in existing male roles will fare much better perhaps as the new york times mahnola dargis has suggested in her critical review of the film women and men will have a chance to be funny together without much controversy in which case we may actually witness something revolutionary
Feb 5 2017,positive,the whole this is retro
Feb 5 2017,negative,its unfunny poorly scripted poorly written trash this is a reboot that absolutely nobody asked for i mean its actually painful to watch even mcarthy isnt funny in this the only thing good in this is the ghost cgi from there every other thing is rubbish im going to give it a 110
Feb 5 2017,positive,i love because its funnyawesome and cool
Feb 4 2017,negative,i was expecting this movie to be decent because i like melissa mccarthy this is one of the worst pieces of garbage ever put on the big screen do not waste your time with this film how this movie got good reviews  absolutely dumbfounds me
Feb 4 2017,positive,the ladybusters furore is biggest fuss over nothing regarding a film that i think i can remember shock horror this was absolutely fine its great fun i want to put kate mckinnon in my pocket and take her everywhere with me
Feb 4 2017,negative,the worst movie of 2016
Feb 3 2017,negative,ugha very hard watch bad bad bad i highly recommend sticking with the original stay away from ghostbusters 2 though
Feb 3 2017,negative,horriblehuge plot holes terrible character development and choppy plot
Feb 3 2017,positive,greatest film of 2016
Feb 2 2017,positive,this was a fantastic movie it had me laughing from start to finish i even waited all the way past the credits to see if they would hint at a second film and to my delight  they did i cannot wait
Feb 2 2017,negative,went into it with an open mindbut it just wasnt funny or thrilling oranything
Feb 1 2017,positive,if you dont compare it to the originals the fact they kept pushing in the chick flick direction and then coming back so not to lose a big chunk of the audience and the fact they changed the original trackit was pretty good  as a gb fan i was glad to see all the throwbacks to the originals such as the man himself bill murray and much others of the original cast  id say give the film a watch but dont compare it to the originals or you will be let down
Feb 1 2017,positive,this reboot of the ghostbusters franchise was great visuals cast storyline everything this is the best reboot of a franchise i have ever seen
Jan 31 2017,positive,a worthy addition to the franchise the comic timing of the leads  all of them but especially kate mckinnon and kristen wiig  is flawless the first half of the movie is actually better because it focuses on situations and reactions the second half which gets into the mayhem and weird weapons stuff seems a bit too contrived also it seemed that a lot of bits were relegated to the credits that might have helped the movie along  like the big dance number still highly enjoyable id recommend it to anyone who likes schtick comedies
Jan 31 2017,negative,a horribly long and unfunny movie  miscast misdirected  no redeeming value
Jan 31 2017,negative,paul fieg needs to be thrown out of hollywood for this farce  not funny boring pace waste of talent spy was good so he has done something right in his life but anything this bad deserves jail time for fraud he had the onscreen talent to make this a success but not the ability hint for the future come up with something new reboots dont work especially  when you give it over to a no talent hack
Jan 31 2017,positive,id like to start by saying i had no desire to see this movie because i disliked the original version after just watching the modern female ghostbusters free on demand i realized it would have been worth paying to see hands down 100 better now then all others the monsters were appropriate for children humorous diverse group of ghostbusters and most importantly kept my attention the entire time i liked how no one person came off as the  main character as well so all of the women got the spotlight
Jan 30 2017,positive,awesome reboot i didnt think id like this one but i did  how spoiler alerti love that they brought back all the living cast members of the original 1984 version
Jan 30 2017,positive,a textbook example of group improvisation vs standard plotting
Jan 30 2017,positive,this was fun inane silly and without much of a plot device so 35 is its ceiling but really its exactly what youd want from ghostbusters leslie jones is a bit ridiculous and unfortunately sort of plays into the tokenism of the first movie but the other 3 are topnotch casting jobs cameos by bill murray  sigourney weaver are a nice touch
Jan 30 2017,negative,this was in no way a comparison to the original they tried too hard pandered too much and made me too angry with the jokes that werent cerebral or funny in the slightest the plot was murky at best they should have just gone new age instead of wipe and reboot
Jan 29 2017,positive,three stars is a bit of a stretch but the movie certainly has a good amount of heart  the biggest problem is that most of the jokes are as vapid as chris hemsworths character  the good jokes dont really come until the middle of the movie and the ending just runs out of steam  some of the characters have potential but its not developed as far as it should have been
Jan 29 2017,negative,i gave it a full star because of kate mckinnon the rest was crap
Jan 29 2017,negative,paul fieg is now a one trick play pony his new brand of comedy is not funny taking major elements from the original plot also hurt this film
Jan 29 2017,negative,well to say that it pales in comparison to the originals is being kind there is no semblance of a overarching story line or bill murruy love subplot the comedic lines not as clever or as witty did not even finish watching
Jan 29 2017,negative,movie was unbelievably awful
Jan 28 2017,positive,interesting and at times funny reboot of the classic comedy from the 80s withâ  gender reversal carsting of all the main roles the cast is terrific i found leslie jones and chris hemsworth particularly amusing unfortunately comparisons to the original are inevitable this one is flashier with better effects and some funny cameos from many of the original cast theres even a flashy new version of the staypuff marshmallow man thats quite amusing but overall the movie seems disjointed and seems to be nothing more than a bunch of humorous vignettes strung together to highlight some noisy effects and musical numbers its just okay
Jan 28 2017,neutral,its okay its not terrible its not brilliant its just fine there are some funny jokes and not so funny jokes there are some entertaining scenes and not so entertaining scenes its a bit of a mixedbag but i dont think it deserves the kind of hate it received leading up to its release there are far worse movies out there and this is definitely not one of them i love the chemistry between the four leads and paul feig does a solid job of balancing the comedy with action ghostbusters 2016 doesnt bring anything new to the table but it is also not a total failure its just fine
Jan 28 2017,neutral,there was a lot of bad blood spilled upon this film way before it even hit theaters and i understand why it did i believe in the saying if it aint broke dont fix it and coming into this movie i had that mindset the original ghostbusters is a classic for many and by remaking some call it a sequel the movie youre just trying to piss people off for me i didnt really care about the news but i always keep an open mind for anything after finishing the film i didnt hate it but i understand why many would the final act is just a glossier rehash of the originals third act and the stars lacked major chemistry hemsworths character was hard to like with how poorly written he was and i wasnt a fan of mckinnons character either i was pleased with leslie jones performance and she was the only character that i enjoyed throughout the film there are some really good moments but its mostly overshadowed with its clumsier moments another prime example of if it aint broke dont fix it
Jan 28 2017,positive,i normally trust movie reviews but they got it wrong here this movie was the funniest ive seen in a long time they could not have picked a better cast
Jan 28 2017,positive,is it the original no could it have been done better at times sure   is it amusing and does it bear enough nods to the original to make you want to include it in a ghostbusters marathon absolutely
Jan 28 2017,negative,hated it im just gonna mention if mellisa mycarthy wasnt even in the movie people would be giving it 73 rotten tomatos
Jan 27 2017,positive,chris hemsworth in a comedy is simply precious
Jan 26 2017,positive,i waited all the way till now to see it because i was not in a rush to see it all the negativity before in the movie was even released got to me and i did not bother the go out of my way to watch the film i regret that even for the people that hate it on it after i came out you probably didnt want the cartoon show thats when it really captured the core of it being the ghostbusters was how silly it got which wasnt a bad thing with that in mind it was like watching good friends of mine make a movie and i enjoyed it even more with that in mind
Jan 24 2017,negative,so batman vs superman suicide squad all got bad review but ghostbusters got certified fresh wow critics these days dont know what theyre talking about
Jan 23 2017,positive,an enjoyable remake of the 1984 movie with a gender reversal for all characters i thought this film worked quite well with all female leads and a modern cgi makeover  710 rev 375
Jan 23 2017,positive,this is not the film that i was promised its much better than i expected it to be
Jan 21 2017,negative,im not sure how movies like this get certifiably fresh just stunk
Jan 21 2017,negative,well i think this movie suffered most from the time period they just dont make them like they used to seriously it seems like just the same old comedy script with the same style of laughs but with a story about ghost catching its sad that movies feel the need to go for so many cheap laughs these days     in that sense this movie specifically didnt fail the whole dang movie industry failed this was a raunchy comedy it fits the mold who knows what the original was was it comedy drama scifi  that was the beauty of it it was a movie that told a story without worrying about fitting a mold   was this new one enjoyable yes did i laugh yes beyond that i have no interest to see it again so many flaws i cant even choose the one great thing about the original is i totally bought it it was realistic and believableas crazy as that sounds right from the script and even the visual effects this movies vfx seemed way off to me  the art direction was no where near what i think works for a ghost i realize they can make them look however they want with nothing in reality to reference but it just didnt seem real it felt very video gameesq     on the positive side it really makes you appreciate just how good the original is
Jan 21 2017,positive,i really like the idea of this movie even tho its a female cast its still funny
Jan 21 2017,negative,chris hemsworth is the only reason to see this i tried my best to like it but it was just bad
Jan 21 2017,positive,good take on an original but cannot beat a bit of bill murray
Jan 21 2017,negative,its unfortunate that im unable to leave a negative number of stars in review of this film i went into it open minded  i knew that it wouldnt measure up to magic of the original film but decided to view it as a stand alone give it a chance as a comedy film  even in that vein it was beyond disappointing      at no point watching the film did i crack a smile let alone  laugh the attempts at comedy felt forced and left me cringing the characters had no chemistry on screen it felt like at best a poor attempt at a comedy skit that just didnt no where it was going or when to stop    the ghosts were bright and blingy there was no tension no connection with the characters and flow so little of it made sense within its own universe one minute their weapons lasso and capture a ghost the next theyre exploding them and turning them to a pile of goo then at the end theyve built a containment unitwhy do they need a containment unit if they now have the technology to simply turn them to mush     chris hemsworths character was the most forced of them all a dumb blonde receptionist really well thats original ok so hes male but everything else about his character lives up to stereotype jeanene not sure on the spelling was part of the team she had brains enough she was competant had attitude and presence kevin is so pointless and painful to watch i really dont know what they were trying to achieve here     i wanted to like this film i really did but in all honesty its the worst film ive seen for a very long time even my children agree the toilet humour wasnt enough to engage them so if i didnt like it my children my teenager didnt like it and my boyfriend didnt like it four demographics then im struggling to see who this film was actually aimed at    id love to be able to say that it was bad but here are some redeeming features but i really am struggling to find a single one i am all for strong female characters  for breaking stereotypes and gender expectations but this this did nothing for the cause it really was a car crash of a film and in my mind pushed back the fight for gender equality rather than moving it forward     seriously unless you want to see this just so that youre able to offer people an informed opinion as to why it really is so bad then dont bother its two hours of my life i will never get back that i could have spent doing something more entertaining and less painfullike sticking pins in my eyes perhaps
Jan 20 2017,positive,it was simply awesome
Jan 17 2017,negative,i gave this movie a chance  i really did  i truly cannot believe it has this high of a rating  its unfunny bland looking and embarrassing  all parts of this movie is tv quality not even close to cinematic watch the original and show anything else to a child and if you want theses ghost buster to be your child role models than you have low expectation for your child
Jan 17 2017,negative,really not funny at all and it reminds me of the first live action 2002 scooby doo movie not in a fun nostalgic way but in a bad childish way with the same quality of special effects  the men in this movie are viciously portrayed as the dumbest creatures on the face of the earth it goes as far as a man trying to reach through an aquarium but fails because he doesnt understand how glass works      honestly one of the worst movies ive seen  it feels like a disney haunted house ride thats too scary for two year olds and literally no one else
Jan 16 2017,positive,a good reboot with a female cast of ghostbusters i was quite skeptical but they wisely did not just try to use the format of the original movie well maybe they did  but they took full advantage of the strength in the movie the charisma of the cast members  good pacing nice colourful scenes  fun energy  some nice nods to the original series
Jan 16 2017,positive,the movie was outstanding and way underrated the cast was hilarious especially kate mckinnon 
Jan 15 2017,negative,this is a mediocre attempt to recapture the fun and freshness that was the hallmark of the original  this one not so much in fact not really at all  the special effects are hit and miss and the script is weak  the four ladies acquit themselves very well and of course there are cameos by bill murray and dan aykroyd  the late harold ramis who originated the first film is remembered  i give this a straight c not even a c
Jan 15 2017,positive,as good as the original hilarious cast funny characters and very good effects the reboot has everything from the first movies dont hate it or you gettin busted by the ghostbusters your ghostbuster
Jan 15 2017,negative,theres no reason for this film to exist its an exact copy of the original just without the charm and heart
Jan 14 2017,positive,even if is a reboot is not bad like other ones i find this movie so funny and very interesting the actresses  actors  made a good job and the special effects were awesome
Jan 14 2017,negative,this remake of the original is crap and it has nothing to do with the actors that play the main roles its just overall bad and the cameos have not even been done correctly  if you want to see a ghostbusters movie you know who you have to call the original 1984 movie that was awesome on so many levels  i really wish they would have thought about this my wife even said that they tried to make it like a marvel franchise superhero movie and failed  this will be like one of those flop award movies  the four ladies are much better than this show and should not be blamed for this poor movie  i do not recommend it
Jan 14 2017,negative,nice try but not even close
Jan 14 2017,negative,disappointing the humor in this film seems tailored to 11 year olds the plot is ramshackle at best the characters lack any semblance of chemistry and some scenes are so filled with inane dribble that i depresses me to think that i payed to see this pile of garbage this film does not deserve the ghostbusters name it took a beloved franchise and completely missed the point of what made the original unique and popular my honest opinion dont watch this unless youre being held at gunpoint actually on second thought a bullet would be less painful
Jan 12 2017,positive,okay its not the worst film ive ever seen but when i saw it in theaters i thought it was good to add melissa mccarthy and kristen wiig in the movie because there funny actors so yeah pretty good not the worst
Jan 12 2017,positive,ghostbusters is perhaps a little predictable but it has a lot of funny scenes a charismatic cast and a story that entertains the spectator since the beginning until the end
Jan 10 2017,negative,scooby doo with more fart jokes
Jan 9 2017,negative,i pirated it and i still want my money back it wants to be an action movie waaayyyyyy to much awful start and awful ending most of the jokes suck the characters are awful the pacing is the worst ever hell even the original theme song feels forced
Jan 8 2017,negative,this movie kept reminding me of pixels a bythenumbers disposable comedy the two movies have very similar audience scores 46 for pixels to 54 for gb but very different tomatometer scores a whopping 73 for bg and a dismal 16 for sandlers opus im guessing a lot of critics defended gb out of political considerations they would make a good double feature if you needed to entertain a group of 10yearold children
Jan 8 2017,negative,once again the remake train derails into another franchise with ghostbusters the 2016 comedy that seems to be made by people who have never seen the original film the funny thing is that i now am filled with regret after seeing this overtly controversial film of this summer      melissa mccarthy kristen wiig kate mckinnon and leslie jones star as the title characters in this film about the paranormal invading new york city and the recently unemployed small business owners that are here to fight this new nuisance a bell boy named rowan neil casey is expanding ghost activity for some reason coming to a climax with times square full of scares times scare slime square      the script is immature at best and bottom feeding at worst a nice  middle finger scene here a crotch shot there basic 13 year old humor like that which plays well to kids and the soft headed the story is like falling from a tree with the plot hitting one branch then another then another and never really landing anywhere to settle except the eventual land fill that this film feels destined for      i cant really say that the acting is bad youre only as good as your script and weve already established the mess that road map is the real issue with the main core of the cast is that there is little chemistry between the quartet this is probably the biggest fault with ghostbusters 16 especially compared to the chemistry that is exuded in the original film even the sequel felt more on point than this film and it shows this is reason this film didnt click with viewers too      i will admit that i was very pessimistic when it came to discussing this film and it wasnt because of the swapping of the sexes though that felt like it was marketed as a gimmick in all honesty the film didnt look good from trailers and research that i did prerelease even if it didnt have the no ghost insignia stamped on its marketing this film would have been mediocre this one had to stand up to one of the most beloved films of the last 30 years it feels rushed and thrown together into something for the mass quantities to consume instead of that special thing that was the original film im not going to blame the cast because it feels like they actually believed in what they were doing an honest retelling of a story that they grew up with just like you and me no this is a failure on director paul feigs part he delivers a soulless film that is just empty calories to be purged and forgotten in a day or two an albatross on a decent career
Jan 8 2017,negative,not nearly as horrible as the trailers but its still bad bust this franchise it was lightening in a bottle
Jan 8 2017,negative,forseeable overused jokes no charisma so bland you dont even care to hate it i actually fell asleep after 20mins and had to start over just bleh
Jan 7 2017,negative,melissa mccarthy is one of favourite comedy actors but feig failed to deliver the quirky crass humour of bridesmades i think it is down to feig needing a more adult focused movie for the humour to shine  after watching it i felt like i had been on a lacklustre theme park ride and the final battle was very poorly delivered with no tension or fear like the orgianal movies
Jan 6 2017,positive,awesome movie loved it
Jan 6 2017,positive,its funny innovative and holds its own ground also gotta love all the cameos they really bring this to life and give credit to the old
Jan 5 2017,negative,this was as bad as the original was good somebody should be ashamed
Jan 5 2017,positive,a well made remake that tries a bit hard though ad has far too much stuffed into its overloaded plotline i liked the use of thor as a blondbimbo reversing age old sexism and the movie did have its moments i just somehow wish that it had been an original story and not a remake which made it feel a bit stalepredictable
Jan 5 2017,positive,amazing cast hilarious
Jan 5 2017,neutral,this movie had a lot of backlash going in so a lot of people would be going into this movie with low expectations with that its going to surprise a lot of people as it turned out to be a lot better than the majority of people thought after seeing trailers and promos ghostbusters is a reboot not a sequel of the classic ghostbusters movie and although ive never watched the full original movie i know enough about it to tell that this new movie follows the same general premise and plot the change up is the characters this time having an all female cast with generally all comedians and chris hemsworth kevin as the receptionist easily my favourite out of this cast was kate mckinnon jillian holtzmann i didnt know too much about her before except for some snl skits and i thought she was easily one of the more likeable characters and she was definitely the funniest character in the movie as for the others they were all generally funny this role of melissa mccarthy abby yates is a bit different than her others taking a bit more of a serious role than her normal pure comedy roles but i thought she did a good enough job to make the movie enjoyable the main issues i had with this movie is the overall plot it was basically a recycled version of the original ghostbusters however with little twists that i actually found made the movie worse the villain was absolutely terrible he had no backstory no purpose and was just there so there could be someone to fight against in the action scenes they also relied a lot on references to the old movie which i find is something reboots are doing a lot of these days and while tributes can be very nostalgic and good for the movie any time the theme song played it was probably everyones favourite part relying on them just makes it lazy and proves to be a way to distract the audience from the submediocre movie around it all in all ghostbusters is a fun time it will keep you entertained and the humour delivered from some of the funniest females in movies keep you satisfied but a lazy plot and terrible character development from the villain make it a movie that comes nowhere close to its original and unlike the original will not be one that people will remember its only worth watching if youre bored
Jan 4 2017,negative,i do not consider this a good reboot i do not consider this a good movie was it god awful as the trailers made it out to be no the cast were talented  worked their damnest to make it entertaining and i had one or two chuckles but the jokes were lame the effects were lame with the exception of one or two moments the homage to the original movies were lame
Jan 4 2017,positive,i found this movie to be thoroughly entertaining and while some of the humor was way over the top and not quite funny at times the overall experience was quite enjoyable i love the actresses in this movie and putting them together was just fantastic but i would like to say something to everyone out there complaining about the female leads in the movie the amount of male leads in cinema is through the roof we need more female leads in movies i dont see why men ive talked to found female leads in this movie to be such a huge problem some even made it seem like it was world ending i just dont understand    this version of ghostbusters may not have been as good as the original but i enjoyed the way they sort of made it an alternate universe in which quite a few of the genders were reversed it was funny and cute definitely buying it on dvd
Jan 4 2017,positive,so wonderful and smart and brave
Jan 3 2017,negative,this movie was horrible
Jan 3 2017,positive,another hilarious yet interesting movie featuring my favorite actress melissa
Jan 3 2017,positive,with its quick witty comedy and well timed execution the new ghostbusters can hold up against the old with the use of small homages to the original the comedic crew makes us feel the modernized nature of the film and characters but still make it feel homey and original
Jan 3 2017,negative,this movie forcefully goes out of its way to apply the age old female movie stereotypes to every male character in the film and failsriddled with pre teen childish vulgar humorthe humor that was in it felt very forcedthis one was not witty or clever at allhonestly one of the worst movies i have seen in a long timei regret watching it lolif you wanna see good girl power movies i suggest the underworld series or even even star wars episode 7
Jan 2 2017,negative,this movie was made out to be funnier then it really is nothing to brag about
Jan 2 2017,positive,i watched the original and i prefer the new one  great for kids and families
Jan 2 2017,negative,big budget fan fiction     i wanted to like this based on the description ghostbusters reboot with female ghostbusters and there are enough jokes and special effects to make a good trailer but all they did was swap the original characters for comic book style cutouts with one personality trait apiece rehashed the original story with a poorly developed mad scientist storyline and then filled in the rest with oneliners obligatory cameos and gadgets that look like they came straight from the merchandising department    ghostbusters deserved better
Jan 2 2017,neutral,the ending was pretty good and i liked kevin but the rest of the movie was pretty bad
Jan 2 2017,negative,gave it a try but no where near as good as the original last 15 minutes were the best
Jan 2 2017,positive,i dont know how people didnt like this movie it was great
Jan 1 2017,positive,this movie was hilarious exactly what i expected from these ladies the people who are complaining about the special effects and the jokes must not have seen the originals this was a great tribute to the franchise and i hope they make more
Jan 1 2017,negative,this film felt too much like a poor tribute to the original rather than a film in its own right didnt really rate the comedy too slapstick
Jan 1 2017,positive,it was an ok move i like how added characters from the previous one
Jan 1 2017,negative,it smells like burnt baloney and regrets down here  patty tolan
Dec 31 2016,negative,worst attempt at comedy since meet the spartans the makers of this movie showed nothing but contempt for the source material and its fans it was completely built on bullshit political agendas and deliberate controversy and i say that as a fan of the directors previous movie spy and the female led star wars movies of late  whether youre a fan of the original or not ghosbusters 2016 is filled with unlikeable characters crap cartoons special effects and a boring script filled with tired slapstick gags avoid like the plague
Dec 31 2016,neutral,as preposterous as it sounds remaking a rather unremarkable film except with females as the leads the new ghostbusters actually contains half a pretty good movie    much like the first time around all the fun is in the comedic riffing between the characters and then the lousy special effects take over ugh melissa mccarthy kristen wiig leslie jones and kate mckinnon have excellent chemistry and just the right amount of weirdness to keep things fresh throw in toy candy thor dude chris hemsworth as the ditzy blonde secretary and we have complete sexism reversed nice    sure sure the cgi is what the kids dig and it is technologically awesome but crap is it ever boring stay for the quick banter and catchup on emails during the fight scenes     hipcrank
Dec 31 2016,negative,beyond shit are women really that insecure that dross like this needs to be remade  just a joke avoid like the plague  oh and kate mckinnon was just creepy if shes been a man shed have been locked up
Dec 30 2016,positive,i expected more from this stellar cast i love every single one in the movie but something just wasnt right to me chris hemsworth definitely had me rolling though with his idiotic portrayal of the secretary that was the only thing that kept me little to through the entirety of it
Dec 30 2016,negative,ghostbusters 2016 is without question the most negatively received film of the year before during and after its release and im here to say that while it isnt horrible it certainly doesnt warrant its own existence and there arent many laughs to be had the idea of remaking a classic like ghostbusters comes with a lot of baggage not only is the original ivan reitman film a bonafide 80s classic but the cast was uniformly excellent and helped elevate the material to what it became this film has none of that magic addressing the other controversy i never took issue with an allfemale ghostbusters team apart from begging the question why but funny is funny and this script was seriously lacking the film is directed by paul feig whos made some pretty hilarious comedies like bridesmaids and spy but here delivers a barrage of stilted gags horrendous improv and completely misguided callbacks to the original that further reminds us how unnecessary this whole project was the film stars feig regulars melissa mccarthy and kristen wiig and also kate mckinnon leslie jones and the scenestealing chris hemsworth  hilariously playing an extremely dumb secretary for the femaleled ghostbusters team the plot is virtually the same as the first film 3 scientists and a token black city worker band together to battle ghosts appearing in the city with appearances from slimer the stay puft marshmallow man and an aftercredits scene mentioning gozerthey really swung for the fences with this one the four leads do okay at best surprisingly having wiig and mccarthy playing it more straight to jones and mckinnon giving it their all but apart from a few chuckles i never believed any of these characters were real the film tries to earn some goodwill by featuring cameos from the original cast members but these moments are awkward at best and only further question why this film wasnt just a sequelreboot to the original film basically this is a film that never should have been some things should just never be touched in no way does it deserve the scathing hate it received in particular death threats and horribly sexist comments aimed at the cast but its definitely not an enjoyable film and the cringefactor far outweighs any comedic elements that did work
Dec 30 2016,negative,this movie was a huge disappointment the only positive thing i can say about it is that the special effects where not half bad the movie itself was childish unfunny unintelligent and generally really bad    some reviews giving this movie 9 or 10 stars which is just ludicrous are saying that people cannot handle the feminism in the movie what feminism replacing the original actors with women is not feminism as far as i am concerned and anyway if you care about such things should it not have been two women and two men to be politically correct also the supposedly intelligent women in this movie behave in a typical oldfashioned hollywood stereotype of women way they are mostly downright silly if i were a feminist i would actually have been insulted by this movie    then we have the male clerk that is dummer than a piece of rock if someone had stacked four supposedly intelligent men and a single blond bimbo that is totally devoid of any trace of intelligence together in a movie the social justice warriors would have cried foul so loud that you could hear it across the planet but since it is four women and a stupid male it is okay not really it is even feminism according to some people what a load of bollocks    there is actually a story in the movie although it is well hidden under the silly jokes and silly behavior it is paper thin and rather silly in itself but it could have worked if the rest of the movie was up to snuff but sadly it is not    as i wrote above the only good thing about this movie is the special effects the few scenes that i actually enjoyed was during the big shoot out at the end which had some cool moments i especially liked when jillian pulls a pair of pistols out of her ghostbuster suit and goes on a ghost killing spray    apart from that this movie is best forgotten
Dec 29 2016,negative,i didnt like this movie they were missing the straight man character necessary for balance in goofy comedies   on top of thateach characters goofy traits kept them from coming off as legit nerd scientist that made the first ghostbuster crew so likeable  they didnt need to mirror each charactrbut they could have used one nerdy straight manto give the science a little bit more real feel which in turn gets the geeks like myself going listening to egon and ray nerd out about ancient mythshistory then spout out some theoretical physics but just comes across as silly with this cast instead of likable science nerdsthey play likable socially goofy dorks so they dont pull off the technical side of scientists so it fails big time to measure up to the original  the actors themselves are not badbut the characters are thin and unlikable the best two were kevin and patty thought the other three were kind of almost the same with slightly different personalitiesemphasis on slightly   plus the other thing that irks me is how insecure the main one wasnot sticking up for her opinions which seems very unscience mindedyou usually make opinions based of facts and knowledge  anyway it wasnt all badjust not very good    anywaythe story was decent
Dec 29 2016,positive,it was ok  funny at times but not the originals by far
Dec 29 2016,negative,man i really wanted to find the haters wrong i really wanted all the bad reviews to be sour grapes but actually its just not a good film the problem of the script or potentially the lack of a script every line is played for a joke and not only do almost none of them land but thats often not how comedy works i thought the four leads did alright jobs but without a solid script they werent going to get far i think the real problem here is with paul feig and the scriptwriters sigh
Dec 28 2016,negative,its bad but its not as bad as you think whats bad about it isnt the all girl cast who are actually quite good but it is the naff improv comedy nonsensically riffing through scene after scene that busts this film into the depths of mediocrity the original film was like capturing lightning in a bottle and this merely captures slime
Dec 28 2016,negative,many curious decisions plague this 2016 ghostbusters remake to the 1984 original one such curious decision is to do a remake at all in an era of soft reboots as in when studios want to make new entries to existing franchises they will keep or reference the older filmscharacters tread over familiar ground but ultimately do their own thing 2015s jurassic world is an example while making the original fans happy for cowriterdirector paul feig to disregard the first two films and start from scratch was a disastrous start to the project hinting at what was to come what we get is an overlong introduction to things we have already seen gags we already know and characters or ghosts that have already spooked but nothing feels exciting or new its like the filmmakers and actors are going through the motions jumping from another nod or wink to the other with a whole ton of filler in between at almost 2 hours long one would think that the film has a worthwhile plot to keep you engrossed in the paranormal hijinks but again like with the other curious decisions there is almost no story or substance to the film and it eventually falls into very cliche big budget nonsense one thing that the film has is fine cinematography by robert yeoman with vibrant color some nice shots here and there but the overall flow connecting it all is jumbled together with no real fluidity but the biggest most insulting curious decision that was made with this the fact that nothing is particularly funny which is a damning statement to a film that is supposed to be a remake to something that is in fact very funny 2016s ghostbusters is a callous attempt to cash grab on a known name is insulting to its own fanbase and ends up being as empty and hallow as the fake ghosts that litter the film
Dec 27 2016,positive,a new ghostbusters finally happened but it isnt the one all of us wanted it looked awful to start off with most likely due to the new ghostbusters being all female and it was going to flop too  bill murray sigourney weaver and ernest hudson are in it sure but they make cameo appearances rather than peter dana or winston respectively which is a shame considering though as other reboots have acknowledged a franchises past  when i went to see the movie in july 2016 i was ready to hate on it fully but then did i begin to realise that it wasnt all that bad but it isnt great either leslie jones was the one in particular that continued to make me laugh throughout the movie  the effects were well done however as theyre almost on par with the live action scooby doo films and a little touch of the 1984 ghostbusters movie since slimer appears in it  overall the 2016 ghostbusters is okay so i give it a 35 out of 5
Dec 26 2016,negative,complete crap fest of a movie tried giving it a fair chance but really if anyone is voting this higher than 1 star you can garuntee they were paid or are pushing an agenda the movie itself is a poor script with terrible casting and even worse acting
Dec 26 2016,positive,not a bad reboot but not a great reboot some funny parts in the end though its not as good as the original maybe better than the original sequel but miles away from the original movie
Dec 26 2016,positive,to me this was a pretty funny movie  it has a great cast this is also some of the best 3d i have seen in a movie  pretty cool cinematography i dont know how well it compares to the original cause i was not a big fan of those but it is an okay stand alone film
Dec 26 2016,negative,this is popcorn comedy but there is nothing really laughable ironically the funniest person in this movie is an actor not famous for the comedy roles  chris hemsworth who is a nice change from the tormented thor the rest are either trying to hard to be funny or not trying at all for those who are too young to have seen the original ghostbusters you may be pleased or not pleased to know that this all lady version brings nothing new nice guest appearance from the original cast
Dec 25 2016,negative,bad script and bad acting
Dec 25 2016,negative,dont waste your time watching this crap crap trama crap dialogs crap actresses crap cgi wtf where is old stop motion crap politically correct lets have 4 girls this time worst idea crap end but there are weaver and murrey
Dec 25 2016,positive,good enough well done ladies
Dec 24 2016,negative,bad remake  might just be the worst movie of the year
Dec 24 2016,positive,take the cameos out and pretty unwatchable and i love everyone in the cast so maybe no more ghost busting
Dec 23 2016,positive,i did not expect this remake to be half as good as it is thoroughly enjoyable and updates what is essentially a classic to an early 21st century sensibility
Dec 23 2016,negative,have a good idea before making a movie like this
Dec 23 2016,negative,wow this was a very very bad movie
Dec 23 2016,positive,its tolerable but not even close to the original that being said its a pretty unnecessary and forgettable movie
Dec 22 2016,positive,i was a huge huge fan of the original two movies growing up and i am apparently in the trigger group that liked the second one almost as much as the first  i was a little leery when this movie came up what with harold ramos death  i always thought that ramos was a lot of the creative weirdness that drove movies he wrotedirected  having said that i also have a nasty habit of not believing in sacred cows so i hit play relaxed and enjoyed  we fortunately watched the extended edition because i can guess at what they likely cut for flow or length and it was probably some of the better comedy gems the dance comparison for example    i loved it  i mean i really liked it  i know there are a lot of toss backs i know there are the fun homages i know that the story is the same basic platform as the other movies  dont cross the streams big weird cloud pops up over one weird building blah blah blah  the devil is in the details and there is no way that anyone couldve written this movie without a deep respect for the fans that have kept the brand alive for 30years  if thats your beef with the film i dont have a lot of sympathy for it because they managed to play to their strengths in the franchise without it feeling so painfully forced  the effects wouldve made the original production staff pee their pants  beautiful unique creepy at times  they even took the main character profiles dumped them into a bucket mixed and matched and spread them around with these master comediennes spicing up each role  it made the characters feel comfortably familiar and different enough to keep you interested  the story was tight and you can tell that every character with a line or any moment of focus was cast with tender loving care and attention to detail  the innumerable references to every other cult horror movie classic from the same era  exorcist to beetle juice    i dont rewatch movies very often im bad about it a movie has to real sing to me or make me want to pore over details again and again  ive already rewatched this disc 3x    loved it
Dec 22 2016,negative,hated it  it does disservice to the franchise  theres no real chemistry between the stars here  leslie jones plays the same opinionated lady she plays in nearly every sketch shes ever been in  the other three ladies lack any of the charm they brought to other roles  hemsworth steals the show playing an incompetent hipster receptionist
Dec 22 2016,positive,well this one has its moments definitely butit makes you long for the days of the original the 2016 ghostbusters is a nod to the first one special effects being as they are certainly makes the movie dazzle the original cast all make cameos but it only makes you want egon and the guys back a good movie night at home
Dec 21 2016,negative,noisy mckinnon and jones were good
Dec 21 2016,negative,horrendous movie the only funny part was hemsworthwho was extremely low brow funny this was not a passing of the torch movie but an intended retelling in a universe where all men are aholes or stupid it was very disrespectful to the prior cast and was more like the cartoon versionexcept not entertaining or funny
Dec 21 2016,positive,super entertaining amazing supernatural comedy movie and excellent acting by all the cast especially by leslie jones
Dec 20 2016,neutral,probably sounded great in the pitch
Dec 20 2016,negative,this is a terrible movie on all levels it had an opportunity to have been very good but instead they decided to use a gimmick off a all female cast the cast was not funny the acting was very bad it was one of if not the worst movie of 2016 or possibly the 2000s so far
Dec 20 2016,positive,i really enjoyed this film the cast was great love all the cameos from the original flims hope they make another one great job ladies
Dec 19 2016,positive,it will crack you up especially if you grew up with the original
Dec 18 2016,negative,couldnt finish it simply awful
Dec 18 2016,negative,after watching this twice this is not a good movie which youd wonder why watch it twice i gave it a second try with someone whom hadnt seen it yet i wanted to see if there was something i missed    so there are a few things that bothered me and none of them are really nostalgia which the director claimed was not set in the same universe but took a few moments to reference the original anyway it was acted fine but also seemed forced none of the characters really clicked with the feel for the movie and several characters came across as corny for being corny sake everyone said kate mckinnon was what made this movie i honestly dont see it kates character was one that seemed so forced so corny almost to a fault    the visuals were horrible the under contrasted neon colored ghosts were distracting for a kids comedy this is totally acceptable for adult ghost comedy it was horrendous    the story and buildup was acceptable but the last third of the movie was messy at best things are happening for no reason other things are being setup for deus ex machina moments and you can see them coming    the blatant ignorance by the director to be aware of how people would actually be in this scenario was very clear a dumb mayor and full of dumb male character makes it easy to see why people think this movie is offensive however all that aside you dont need to see this movie unless you want background noise    youre missing nothing if you dont see this movie and thats probably the worse thing you can say for a movie which divided humanity it didnt deserve to be used as a talking point about the problems of society
Dec 18 2016,positive,there were so many things about this movie i did not like and despite that i still found this to be a fun movie even if it wasnt particularly funny i agree that things didnt make sense half the time the jokes were mostly lineorama material as opposed to written jokes youre trying to showcase the comedic chops of your leads but this is not the kind of movie that best fits that idea there was a tonal shift halfway through and some of the cameos were forced i liked the cameos of sigourney weaver ernie hudson and bust of harold ramis i really dug the characters especially holtzmann and kevin rowan not so much but only because i dont know about him
Dec 18 2016,negative,sony tried to paint this as a trolls who hate women putting it down when in reality the movie is horribly dull predictable and recycled jokes awkward interaction between cast including cameos horrible special effects for the most part     its true that this didnt need to be a replica of the old film but they needed someone who understood and loved the first movie to oversee the making of this film there was a smart way to bridge the gap between old and new they could have made the movie super frightening at times only to be played off by the skeptics in the squad they could have done a lot and this wasnt it ghostbusters was not some snl by the numbers comedy skit nor a sci fi action flick it was something unique and special im not opposed to hollywood remaking classics but this was a disaster and is the reason people are getting sick of them the worst of it is that critics gave this certified fresh out of fear from industry backlash as anyone putting the film down was savagely attacked    to anyone out there not just fans of the classic film not part 2 just stay far away from this movie     just go watch the original its leagues better even when compared by todays standards
Dec 17 2016,negative,ill admit that i wasnt the biggest fan of the original ghostbusters movies but almost every part of this seemed forced most of the jokes werent funny the delivery fell short and the story was downright painful this was a mcdonalds toy of a movie in that as soon as you see it you know its going to be disappointing but while youre actually interacting with it its limited capabilities become too apparent to continue the cameos from the original cast werent just predictable they seemed as if the original cast didnt want to be there at all and resented the fact that they had been asked in the first place    every character seemed to be a playedout movie trope which made the writing that much more obviously lackluster some of the cast did a decent job for the roles they were given but the rest seemed to be placeholders at best anyone else could have replaced them and we would have gotten the exact same outcome    maybe if i had been nostalgicallyinvested in the series to begin with i would have liked it better but this just seemed like a popcorn movie where the popcorn is literally the best part of the movie
Dec 17 2016,positive,to be completely honest i wasnt that much of a fan  i thought it was mis cast and that they tried too hard  it had its moments of fun but i wasnt sold  perhaps i didnt see the directors vision
Dec 17 2016,negative,this is the first melissa mccarthy movie that i dont like especially crazy because the same director directed mccarthys spy which is one of my favorite action comedies    it feels like the characters were trying to hard to be stereotypes which left them flat and two dimensional    also i felt the whole lets reverse character genders to be contrived and a distraction all the more so because of the stereotypical character archetypes used     i suppose if i had never seen the originals i may have enjoyed this more but i spent much of the movie thinking about how they did this or that wrong that their tech was a character of the original that their ecto1 looked terrible and things along those lines     it is a pity because in certain remakesreboots star trek robocop  the magnificent seven there were things that the new cast and directors improved over the original that didnt happen here the chemistry never lived up to the originals or surpassed them in any way im going to pretend that this movie remake like punisher warzone never happened
Dec 16 2016,negative,wow was this terrible  stay far far away from this movie  itll leave you wanting to run from your tv and never look back
Dec 16 2016,negative,this movie takes pc culture a minced phallus two lesbians nonsensical jokes large turds puts it all in the blender and liquefies it  save this movie for when your jaw is wired shut and youre recovering from quadriplegia  only then will you be able to drink the aforementioned milkshake
Dec 16 2016,positive,a little light on story and memorably moments but visually delightful and the cast were strong and obviously had a blast with the roles good fun
Dec 16 2016,negative,there are moments but for the most part this movie is unfunny and awkwardly staged
Dec 15 2016,positive,ok so its not the original any original will probably win out over remakes and reboots however i found it funny light hearted and overall fun why does everyone have to be overly critical enjoy it
Dec 15 2016,positive,ghostbusters review what a thoroughly enjoyable film i really didnt expect that i was up in the air as to whether we were going to see tarzan tonight or ghostbusters i think we made the right choice this new take on ghostbusters has been criticised ever since it was announced for very little reason at all but now that the movie can actually be watched people are discovering that the movie is funny has really solid characters is surprisingly clever and pays some very nice homage to the original films the cameos are great i think this movie has been very delicately crafted to have a taste of what made the original films wonderful and yet fresh enough to be enjoyed by modern audiences dont go into this movie expecting something timeless anymore than you would have going to see the new independence day or jurassic world this movie is just meant to be a bit of fun with a set up to a sequel if you approach the movie with lightness then you will leave with a smile on your face humming the well known tune a quick word of warning though this is not a kids movie i dont think the original films really were either but this one definitely isnt it has a decent amount of sexual comments and swearing through out the movie and i think some of the scenes are quite a lot scarier than they have been before dont see this with the kids like the family sitting in front of me did when you see it let me know what you think how funny was chris hemsworth so unexpected right
Dec 15 2016,negative,i cant believe that 4 women that are this funny could be in a movie this unfunny forget the fact its not as fun as the originalthis is a total bore weak storyunbelievably uninteresting and weak villain its not a mess so much as it is a massive disappointment considering all involved to come up with such a feeble product with these people involved is really stunning
Dec 14 2016,negative,piece of shit 73 ioi
Dec 14 2016,negative,dont care much for the cast havent seen any previous works of them    the script in itself already terrible its not really fun to watch  sit through  all in all feig did a terrible job
Dec 14 2016,positive,meh  c or b  forced cameos forced jokes over all ok
Dec 13 2016,negative,not even funny at all the actors was trying to hard to be even funny not my favorite and thanks for screwing up a good movie
Dec 13 2016,negative,i really did try to give this film a chance despite all of the negative hype but the film was not funny and does not stand on its own honestly the only thing that intrigued me was seeing the cameos from some of the original cast    i will add that if you were thinking you had seen the majority of the movie throughout all of the trailers various clips tv spots etc you would have been thinking correctly sony used all of what they considered to be the best material in all of the promotional releases let that be your red flag considering how poor the trailers were
Dec 13 2016,positive,i loved it was very cute hope to see another with them great job beautiful ladies and sexy man
Dec 13 2016,positive,i wasnt sure what to expect in advance but it turned out to be a really fun movie with just enough nods to the original to make a longtime fan happy but at the same time being its own movie  the gang are great the effects are what youd expect and the comedy is fresh and fun
Dec 12 2016,negative,easily one of my leastfavorite movie of the year the jokes are simply exaggerated ideas for jokes rather than actual humor this movies plot is beyond terrible it randomly becomes an unfunny cgi mess when was ghostbusters an action movie paul feig obviously has no interest making a ghostbusters movie but rather just shove his shitty idea of jokes down our throats by slapping a ghostbusters label on the movie and saying dont like it suck it nerds i usually dont say this even with the worst movies i go in with the idea that the people behind it really cared but screw you paul feig im sure youre a good guy that just has trouble accepting criticism i think we all suffer from that in some degree criticism can be hard to take but what made you think it was okay to childishly bash the movies core audience people you dont even know im sure youre a good funny guy but your movie deserved to bomb and you and sony better never pull this stunt again or i guarantee the reaction will be much harsher next time    i know paul feig will never read this but movies like this are truly frustrating and it really gives the idea that studios dont care about making a quality film but rather to fill their wallets its a shame honestly
Dec 12 2016,negative,theres bad theres uwe boll bad and then theres this movie jokes are unfunny the cast is talentless special effects make it seem like a high school presentation the bitter misandry that permeates all of this movie worsens everything if you hate men you may pretend to enjoy this if not stay away
Dec 11 2016,positive,while its disappointing to see great comedians lose they still shoot some laughs even if they dont last long enough
Dec 11 2016,positive,this film was good on its own of course you cannot compare it to the original however i feel most people are far to critical of this movie
Dec 10 2016,negative,didnt make me laugh terrible plot and ironically sexist in its portrayal of men i wouldnt care otherwise but if paul feig is going to call me sexist for hating his stupid movie then im going to point out blatant sexism in his movie
Dec 10 2016,negative,one of the worst films of all time
Dec 10 2016,positive,funny in parts but overall just too cheesy
Dec 10 2016,negative,one of your reviewers stated and i quote better than the originallmao rotten tomatoes you have lost all credibility and sold yourselves out we need a new way to review movies without the bias of the reviewers and their website being paid by hollywood  who owns rotten tomatoes
Dec 10 2016,negative,horrible what a terrible movie 
Dec 10 2016,positive,not bad a little bit funny wiig does well and hemsworth is funny
Dec 10 2016,positive,one day paul feig will make a film that isnt a total mess this one as usual is half an hour too long and too in love with its improv ethos to be edited together so that the story actually makes sense this was still enjoyable though thanks to strong performances like everyone else i was impressed by kate mckinnons breakout wildcard and chris hemsworths comic relief chops
Dec 10 2016,negative,so bland and mediocre i only lasted an hour watching this  if you are going to try and be a comedy then find the humour  i defy anyone giving this more than 2 stars to name 4 instances where they found themselves laughing  dire and a waste of the talented actresses time not to mention mine
Dec 9 2016,positive,funnier than the original i dont understand why this movie has such a low score here the actors are all very strong and very funny i laughed the whole way through and loved the bonding between the characters since i work in software i love to watch women talking jargon and playing with cool gadgets please please please have a second movie
Dec 9 2016,positive,not nearly as bad as the first preview  i would guess the backlash caused a lot of edits and i do not know the cameos that there were which added a lot of enjoyment not close to the original but worth a rentpirate
Dec 9 2016,positive,awesome movie  a treat from the start to the end  never believed that the women could pull it off    kate mckinnon and kristen wiig were the life of the movie chris hemsworth couldnt provide the laughs he meant to provide
Dec 9 2016,positive,being a long time fan of the original i can tell you that this reboot was spectacular i am more than glad that they established their own identity for this movie with a healthy nod to the original throughout they packed in more jokes and modern special effects the lead actresses lit it up with slapstick and brains while all the supporting characters were invaluble to hilarious jokes the result is laughoutloud intelligent and artistic entertainment
Dec 8 2016,positive,loved the movie so much comedy and jokes there was little to zero sexualizing  of the characters and no unrealistic romantic parts so funny
Dec 7 2016,neutral,a mixed bag all around the effects are creative the cast is great  but the script is horrible there is a lot of great jokes and humor in this but it has just as many if not more insufferable humor that not only falls flat makes the only thing you want to see busted be the heads of whoever thought it was funny in the first place ill be generous and give it two and a half but script is key and it really hurts what couldve been a fantastic movie
Dec 7 2016,positive,oh my gosh i loved it loved itttttt four hilarious comediennes that play geniuses that kick serious ghost butt yes please this movie was everything i hoped for when i first heard about it and the sexist backlash the only complaint i have is that some of the language and jokes make this movie a bit inappropriate for children otherwise i would seriously consider letting my daughter watch it just so great
Dec 7 2016,neutral,great actors wasted in my opinion on a poor script they tried to reinvent the ghostbuster movie but included members of the old film cast     the characters could have been the children of the originals one of the old cast could have come back as a ghost of christmas past advising them so many missed opportunities remaking a franchise that didnt need improving   introducing a new audience to the idea is one thing spoiling it for everyone else is another a reason that a lot of the comic moments were a little flat
Dec 6 2016,negative,2 big middle fingers  way up smile and turn to camera b
Dec 6 2016,neutral,this was alright got really silly at the end the ghouls looked pretty cool
Dec 5 2016,negative,half the movie spent trying to nod the old ghostbusters but why
Dec 5 2016,positive,hilarious good for all the family i suggest it for most ppl
Dec 5 2016,positive,this website will not let me post a critical review of this movie the four and a half stars represent the four quota filling lead rolettes and the half star is for the half wit chris hemsworth playing the dumb blonde what a wonderfully suckworthy masterpiece
Dec 4 2016,neutral,it wasnt the worst thing ive ever seen  if i had paid to see it in a theater i would have been a bit upset about it  not quite batman vs superman upset but close
Dec 4 2016,neutral,i thought ghostbusters was a decent movie but all they did was remake the original with a new threat and a diffrent gender team also the idea of having a secret base in a chinese place sucks what is it gonna be next time transgendered
Dec 4 2016,positive,i did like it it was very funny in some parts and a little frustrating in others loved all the cameos
Dec 4 2016,negative,barely rises above adam sandler and pauly shore territory ghostbusters doesnt have any laughs in it and feels like one big effort to make you feel as ashamed as possible for not accepting it
Dec 4 2016,negative,why did they do this thought maybe it would be alright but i sat there the whole time without moving completely stunned by how awful it was
Dec 4 2016,positive,i wasnt too sure about this movie at first lets just say that im glad i gave it a chance melissa mccarthy kristen wiig and leslie jones made it funny but kate mckinnon brought the humor up a notch shes slowly becoming a favorite of mine it was good to see cameos by the 4 main stars of the original     the only thing that i really hated about this movie iswhy did you wait so long to show slimer an hour and a half in really really     overall i thought it was well done
Dec 3 2016,positive,i dont get why so many people hated on this movie i love the original but this one was equally fun and entertaining
Dec 3 2016,positive,ghostbusters does a well job of making action as well as enjoyable moments but it fails miserably in comedy which is a major setback
Dec 3 2016,positive,new generation of ghostbusters with girl power great film
Dec 3 2016,negative,this film is sexist racist unfunny it has poor timing it doesnt respect the source material the characters have no chemistry it wastes five minutes setting up ghosts exist and giving backstory for a ghost who only ever appears twice when the original did all this in two minutesits just subpar and insulting
Dec 3 2016,positive,it was okaybut it seemed a bit forcedlike
Dec 2 2016,positive,had been actively avoiding this one but found myself pleasantly surprised
Dec 2 2016,neutral,dont you cis white males inderstand this movie is the pure definition of sexist this movie was both directed and stars both cis white males dont you cis white males see go screw yourself if you actually like this move
Dec 1 2016,negative,review  im really in two minds about this film because it didnt look too bad and the chemistry between the characters was brilliant but the jokes were silly and the fact that there was ghosts flying around new york didnt seem to surprise anyone i did miss dan aykroyd and bill murray who were perfect for the first movie but kate mckinnon jillian holtzmann played the geeky role quite well and i did chuckle at a couple of leslie jones patty tolan witty lines i think the main problem is that we have seen many movies with melissa mccarthy abby yates and kristen wiig erin gilbert playing these comedic roles so there lines wasnt surprising and the sense of humour wasnt that great the storyline was pretty straight forward basically erin wrote a ghost book with abby which erin wanted taken off shelves because her reputation got tarnished when the book was released but abby still believed in the book so she kept the book on shelves when erin finds out that the book is still being published she hunts down abby to tell her to stop any more copies being released whilst visiting her at her lab abby takes on a job which was given to erin from someone who read there book and she is soon convinced that ghosts really do exist after a few more sightings erins book is sighted by her boss harold filmore charles dance who fires her because he is worried that the book will damage the reputation of the highly rated school erin then joins forces with abby and jillian to fight against ghosts in the city patty also comes on board after calling the ghostbusters when she sights a ghost on the underground personally i wouldnt have released this movie without the original cast because they are what made the first movie so great it still wasnt a bad attempt in reprising the ghostbuster brand in terms of entertainment and a great original concept but the writers need to push the barriers with the ghosts and the humour average    roundup  the person that actually surprised me in this film was chris hemsworth kevin who was a unusual choice to play his role but he done it extremely well its still hard to look at him and not think of thor but he has shown that he has skills to cover every genre anyway this movie was directed by paul feig who brought you bridesmaids which explains why he cast mccarthy and wiig the heat and spy which also starred mccarthy in the lead as he has directed mccarthy and wiig before its hard to change there style of comedy which has made them a hefty profit at the box office that was the main problem with this movie because we have seen this style of comedy many times before from the cast which is why audiences around the world wasnt surprised with the outcome now that the director used a lot of the classic aspects of the original film it will be good to see were he takes the sequel if there is going to be one i just hope that he takes more risks because this film seemed a bit safe to me    budget 145million  worldwide gross 230million    i recommend this movie to people who are into their actionfantasycomedies starring melissa mccarthy kristen wiig leslie jones kate mckinnon chris hemsworth charles dance ed begley jr michael kenneth williams andy garcia bill murray dan aykroyd sigourney weaver and elizabeth perkins 410
Dec 1 2016,negative,kindergartener script sophomoric acting
Dec 1 2016,negative,i finally caved in and watched the movie i wasnt expecting much to be honest  and by that i mean ive set the bar so low that even an earthworm couldnt limbo under it    and this movie still managed to disappoint me its a bad movie bad in every respect its the driest comedy the cartooniest scifi flick the most snooze inducing action movie and the least investing piece of cinematography ive ever seen in my life i thought its gonna be b movie bad or even so bad its good but nope none of that and that comes from a guy that watches b movies and straighttovideos for fun i couldnt crack even the faintest smile even at the things that could be considered so bad that its funny if ireally tried theres nothing but an incoherent mess    i could go on about character development the representation of men and black people the flat elementary school level jokes or just the whole idea overall but im actually so deflated that i cant muster the willpower to do it that dedication to harold ramis was just the final slap in the face followed by the humiliating cameos    certified fresh is a cruel joke
Dec 1 2016,negative,everything has already been said its not funny the effects are uninteresting the characters are wrong its also not scary or suspenseful the story  the plot are i really dont know what they are it was bad it was bad in a way that if they had had a 13yearold direct it or made an actual spoof of the ip it wouldve been a better movie sad
Nov 30 2016,positive,very funny but they showed way too many of the good jokes in the trailer  kate mckinnon was the best lovelove love her character cant wait till the next one
Nov 29 2016,negative,great for girls 14 and under great for someone who has never seen ghost busters in the 80s great if i could get those 2 hrs back
Nov 29 2016,negative,this movie was nothing but a shameless cash grab
Nov 28 2016,positive,you gotta know going in that it is simply a ghostbusters remake with some funny comedic ladies and a silly storyline  dont take yourself too seriously and watch it for what it is  you may actually enjoy it enough to make it worth watching like i did
Nov 28 2016,positive,loved it for the way they honored the original movie
Nov 28 2016,negative,watch the hell did i just watch ozzie cameo was only funny part in it
Nov 28 2016,neutral,the only thing i genuinely enjoyed was the ongoing struggle between mccarthys character and the chinese food delivery guy everything else was either too much or too loud or unnecessary and ruined the pacing very disappointing
Nov 28 2016,positive,too bad the original egon passed away no cameo for him
Nov 28 2016,positive,it was a funny movie but not as good as the first 2 ghostbusters bill murray ernie hudson dan ankroyd harold ramis made those good movies
Nov 27 2016,positive,entertaining enough couple good laughs completely lacks any stakes mckinnon and hemsworth are great messy
Nov 27 2016,positive,i loved the new ghostbusters  originally it looked dumb i thought  i saw it at home and was surprised it was that good  big fan of kristen and melissa  the other 2 i saw in masterminds and liked them both  a lot of good jokes and timing  this ghostbusters i liked just as much as the originals if not more but i miss rick moranis
Nov 27 2016,negative,streamed for free because i had time to kill total crap i want my money back
Nov 27 2016,negative,i went in wanting this film to be a success and visually its stunningly vibrant but whilst the visuals look great the film just didnt hit the same highs  having a female lead cast would seem progressive but the treatment of the male eye candy i think did more harm than good and somehow made the film regress  the nostalgic undertones not with standing the comedy was a bit too obvious at times and at least for me not that funny
Nov 27 2016,negative,tried it didnt like it nothing to do with the female cast but the plot there is none effects and comedy are all missing chris hemsworth brings the only jokes and even they wear thin the cameos are dreadful and laboured and kate mckinnons forced manic behaviour grates throughout the entire film thank god theres no sequel planned
Nov 26 2016,negative,mostly painfully unfunny but there are a few sparse laughs from mckinnon and jones the less said about wiig and hemsworth the better
Nov 26 2016,positive,not as good as the original but it is still a good film lots of very funny moments
Nov 26 2016,negative,if you have never seen the real ghostbusters movie and you like over done cgi and non funny comedians desperately trying to be funny then you will enjoy this movie 
Nov 26 2016,negative,had a few funny parts but just cant compare to the originals
Nov 26 2016,positive,could have been so much better
Nov 26 2016,negative,i liked the original enough but this was terrible humor was pathetic and it insults the original how in the hell does this atrocity have a 72 did i see a different movie my friends hated it too    also people need to stop insisting on calling all of the detractors sexist the all female cast was a patronizing way to include women and i reason i hate this movie was because of the fact that it was unfunny and insulting not their genders
Nov 26 2016,positive,funny melisa mccarthy is great a good popcorn timemovie
Nov 25 2016,negative,compared to other feigs work ghostbusters reboot is a waiting game for the jokes to come in
Nov 25 2016,negative,despite some bad press i watched this with the family while on holiday recently unfortunately the bad reviews were warranted this was almost unwatchable and was the worst movie i have seen in quite a while my tip dont waste your time watching it
Nov 25 2016,negative,this movie was definitely not the worst film reboot of all time but its definitely up there
Nov 25 2016,positive,its funny on its own merit but whats especially satisfying is the way it pats insecure easily emasculated adult boys on their wittle heads
Nov 25 2016,negative,boring and not funny just another cash grab
Nov 25 2016,negative,finally got around to seeing paul feigs ghostbusters there was a lot of buzz around people rejecting it because they couldnt handle the gender swap that may be but it has to be said that it also wasnt original or even funny wiig and mccarthy were just flat mckinnon seemed to be in another film in her own mindwhich she found very funny that works for her in snl sketches but not for two hours the cameos by murray and aykroyd were throwaways when they could have been brilliant weaver was somewhat more substantial but thats not saying much the saving graces of the film are leslie jones and chris hemsworth they both made magic out of dull material but meh
Nov 25 2016,negative,i went in thinking i would give it a shot for 249 rental  the film was just dull the characters just kept talking and talking and forcing jokes then explaining the joke to suck any juice left in it they never stop talking long enough to build any tension or suspense the best part was the start with the ghost and the tour guide beyond the lack of humour or horror it was not engaging and just felt like skits loosely held together i watched to the credit and after credit scene and those scenes were better than any in the movie
Nov 25 2016,positive,this new remake of ghostbusters relies too heavily on the originals meaning that it doesnt set up its own rules for the movie  if you hadnt seen the first two ghostbusters you might be a little lost watching this one as a standalone
Nov 25 2016,negative,this film is a rip off the cast  are not good do not buy this film why did they have to remake the ghost busters take it  out of the shops    one extra point about putting women in these films why do they have to copy another film are they unable to make their own films whoops i said that out load
Nov 24 2016,negative,total garbage a rolling dumpster fire would have been more entertaining i love the actresses but the direction story jokes and racism just made this thing uncomfortable to watch
Nov 24 2016,negative,its nothing like the original i can only say that the acting was fine just stick to original ghostbusters
Nov 24 2016,neutral,meh wanted to like it  really did  and the cameos and homages to the past are fun actors are game kate especially but turns out if the script is weak it doesnt matter what gender your ghostbusters are
Nov 23 2016,neutral,255similar to the new star wars i wasnt totally sure if this was supposed to be mostly a remake or an original film it had some funny moments and the cast was fine my biggest problem was that there was absolutely zero development in the story of who or what they were fighting at the end  it all just kinda happened and it had zero drama and totally failed to draw you in  another example of why we dont need these reboots unless you are going to really develop something new with some depth to it
Nov 23 2016,positive,ghostbusters is so funny
Nov 23 2016,negative,the movie cant get past its heady agenda for feminism enough to deliver a movie where you care about the feminine heroes
Nov 22 2016,negative,woof    i tell you no lies pay attention to who gives overwhelmingly positive reviews of this movie and know that you should disregard them from this point forwards
Nov 22 2016,positive,i heard a lot of stuff about this moving sucking really hard so i was very surprised when it didnt  nothing compares to the first 2 but it was funny and the graphics were good
Nov 22 2016,negative,a money grab remake that tried to cash in on as much of the original as possible cgi just barley managed to contend with the 1984 original too hard not to compare them with a dofferent title and storyline maybe a 2 12 star movie
Nov 22 2016,positive,its girl power vs naughty ghosts kid friendly as nobody actually seems to get really hurt or killed and its a bit funny too which you might expect with melissa mccarthy in it    my favorite scene they have a ghost lassoed in the subway tunnel just something hilarious about that scene    it seems like about the worst thing the average ghost does is spit gooey slime on humans     girl power and teamwork saves the day
Nov 21 2016,negative,sad movie ridiculous adaptation of the ghostbusters franchise they should have make a movie on its own at least that way the fans would not have end up so upset
Nov 21 2016,negative,ok  how the critics get 72 is way beyond me  luckily we watched on rental but it was so just awful  i kept watching thinking it might get better but i got to the end  and no it didnt
Nov 21 2016,neutral,despite the desperate attempt to create a movie worth watching by adding star power and great special effects the plot and overall writing is soo bad we could hardly finish the movie
Nov 21 2016,negative,this movie is the cinematic equivalent of masturbating with a chainsaw any positive review is being provided by someone who was paid to do so  absolutely awful
Nov 20 2016,positive,it was the effects that doomed this movie if they stuck with the practical effects i know it would have done a million times better the cast was funny and funthe script could have used some work  but the horrible effects doomed it looking passed the horrible effects it was four star
Nov 20 2016,positive,its not the kind of movie thats going to change the worldbut its fantastic fun if youre a fan of the original this version does a great job of being new enough yet giving awesome nods to the original that warmed my nostalgic heart just an absolute bunch of fun and some good laughs
Nov 19 2016,negative,this is an abysmal remake my girlfriend and i couldnt believe how awful it was and had to turn it off halfway through
Nov 19 2016,negative,sporadically entertaining and more awkward than funny the 2016 reboot of ghostbusters is a frustrating attempt to introduce a femaleled cast especially when theyre as talented as wiig mccarthy mckinnon and jones
Nov 18 2016,positive,this film was a perfect addition to the franchise i have seen the original ghostbusters movies about twenty or thirty times each and i can tell you that this movie seemed to fit right in with them i loved seeing some of the original actors and i can guarantee ill be watching this again sometime soon
Nov 18 2016,positive,i laughed good watch 
Nov 18 2016,positive,almost as good as the first but with todays comedy twist
Nov 17 2016,positive,the storm of negativity that surrounded the making of this movie eventually convinced me not to go see this in theatres so i waited till it was dvd quality online and watched it with my older brother i now regret not going to the theatre for it because we both enjoyed it quite a bit i liked the new ghost catching tools and weapons they came up with for the movie plus the humor was if not as clever or subtle as some of the classic ghostbusters material at least more laughoutloud maybe i will buy the dvd to make up for missing it at the theatre
Nov 17 2016,positive,a must see hilarious and entertaining movie
Nov 16 2016,negative,terrible movie probably ruined ghostbusters forever the cameos were the worst part just brought the feelings of they should be ghostbusters
Nov 15 2016,negative,want to know what movie no one should attempt to remake this one take your typical funny female comedians and make them not funny at all in this sad sad remake dont waste your time
Nov 15 2016,negative,simply not funny with nary a laugh to be found the cast is monotone the script relies mostly on jokescience gibberish which was amusing the first time or two but was obviously filler by the 20th time skip this turkey
Nov 14 2016,positive,better than i thought it would be
Nov 14 2016,positive,the new ghostbusters has nothing to worry aboutits a charming story with a great femaleled cast and some oozing cgi
Nov 13 2016,neutral,the jokes flow effortlessly in the first third of the film everything else was forced
Nov 13 2016,positive,well those bad reviews are pure ranting trash  this is hilarious i used to like the 80s movies and grew up with the cartoon of course i watched those trough the 90s cause i was a little girl  and now this reboot is awesome i laughed a looot  effects are great  the original gb were in it  why do we have to the it just because some old narrow minded people and some sexists people do  the whole thing is great   is cool that theyre women hilarious women but i would have also loved it if they were hilarious men  this is a great fun movie
Nov 13 2016,negative,mehsuch high hopes  its cutekind of lost interest a few times
Nov 13 2016,negative,so glad i didnt pay to see this in a movie theatre  only spending a few bucks at red box and being able to drink beer helped me to be able to sit through this if you try and think of it more of an action film it helps as it really isnt funny a few scenes are good for a chuckle for the sheer weirdness but those are few and far between the wife and i both found it disappointing not funny and hard to sit through sad treatment of a true classic film
Nov 13 2016,positive,snl  dumb thor  ghostbusters storyline funny stuffs
Nov 12 2016,neutral,whats is right with this film the cast is funny and well done the cameos of the original cast  whats wrong the story the bad guy main ghost or demon a living human being that sucks the level of stupidity of the assistant that is not ghostbusters 3 but instead ghostbusters redone
Nov 12 2016,negative,terrible innuendo and language for a kids movie this was not necessary nor the sexism
Nov 12 2016,negative,shockingly unfunny very disappointing waste of a very talented cast
Nov 12 2016,positive,never compare me to the jaws mayor never lol
Nov 12 2016,positive,i say yes relive the 80s fun
Nov 12 2016,positive,a lot better than i expected the uncut version is much funnier
Nov 12 2016,positive,absolutely brilliant movie would definitely recommend
Nov 12 2016,positive,1110 would watch again
Nov 12 2016,negative,making a joke with a lot of nasty stuff and failed to clean it up new ghostbusters looked like that for me
Nov 12 2016,negative,absolutely horrible
Nov 12 2016,neutral,this movie was not as bad as i thought it was going to be based on the reviews the problem is that the original was so good that it is hard to duplicate that i really wish they would have made this an continuation of the original plot instead of trying to recreate it it is a bad remake but could have been a good continuation
Nov 12 2016,negative,review to be completed    detest all the sexism that the cast have endured    but its not a good film    im a fan of wiig and mccarthy in general though leslie jones brings the most humanity to her character in this     but its not a good film    mckinnon doesnt work
Nov 11 2016,positive,it has some truly funny moments and good character development in an age of super hero movies the new ghostbusters is refreshing and fun
Nov 11 2016,positive,im rather surprised at the audience score for this film  personally i dont care what the rest of you say  i liked it  it was a new fresh face on the franchise and contained enough nods to the original that made it enjoyable for fans of both      dont compare this film to the original because its a brand new story with a brand new approach but the elements are all there to make it fun
Nov 11 2016,positive,hysterical great followup to the original
Nov 11 2016,positive,surprisingly a good movie while i would try and not compare or even think of the first 2 as they are in no real way linked this movie has credibility on its own  i felt the film had a strong scooby do style direction and there are a few scenes towards the end i think they should have done away with or perhaps done better despite the plot holes the film did rather well even playing some cameos with some of the original cast if you liked scooby doo then im sure that you will like this movie
Nov 10 2016,positive,has its moments not as awful as the internet insisted definitely not worth the hassles leslie jones had to deal with
Nov 10 2016,positive,the holtzmann character was over did in my opinion and i think they could have dialed back on her it was almost distracting other than that it was a good funny movie
Nov 10 2016,negative,most of the jokes are quite bad
Nov 10 2016,positive,im a fan of the originals and i actually really enjoyed this funny cool exciting interesting love the cameos worth a watch
Nov 9 2016,positive,definitely going into my collection
Nov 9 2016,neutral,not as good as the original but pretty harmless for those who dont like scary things there was some good comedy though
Nov 9 2016,negative,such a horrible horrible movie
Nov 8 2016,negative,omfgthis wasnt very funnynot at allhorrible movie i want my money back
Nov 8 2016,positive,funny as hell dont listen to the haters
Nov 8 2016,positive,hilarious particularly until the final act chris hemsworth is wholly convincing and a comedic revelation much the same way channing tatum surprised us in 21 jump street
Nov 8 2016,positive,unpopular opinion the remake it better    kristin wiig  bill murray
Nov 8 2016,negative,its terrible on every level
Nov 7 2016,negative,horrid and painfully unfunny feels like watching the last skit of the worst season of saturday night live on repeat for 90 minutes
Nov 7 2016,negative,embarassing waste of film predictable in a way that makes you suffer  making a reboot means high risk of failure itself remarkably this movie scores the big goal whit taking the word boredom to a brand new unexplored level  to avoid at any cost
Nov 7 2016,positive,ive never seen the orgianal and enjoyed watching this remake i wasnt sure why everyone was egging on this movie when the trailer came out because no one had even seen it yet i recommend this as a fun movie to just watch and relax its not the greatest film but it was enjoyable
Nov 7 2016,negative,worst movie ive ever seen it literally makes ghost rider and super mario brothers look like cult classics the comedy was terrible and just made me cringe throughout the film luckily it was bootlegged and unfortunately in was forced to watch it i knew it was going to be bad the first time i heard about it do not watch and as for the director do not make a sequel to this garbage you ruined ghostbusters
Nov 7 2016,negative,i couldnt wait to see this remake but sadly it could quite possibly be the worst film ive ever seen badly written with an embarrassing script characters i couldnt care less about poor acting awful editing disappointing effects no direction so unfunny and crude its untrue i wonder how much money was paid for those 4 and 5 star critic reviews there really is nothing to like about this movie an insult to film making 
Nov 7 2016,negative,most of the movie felt lame biggest problem was the obvious comparison to the originals and coming quite a bit shot in every department this movie felt more about gender stereotype outlook then the supernatural comedy i was expecting while the addition of a male dumb blonde receptionist is original its just not funny enough  the best parts for me were the cameo by the original stars
Nov 6 2016,positive,i thought it was great with all bad reviews set aside
Nov 6 2016,negative,awful  not even remotely funny and a very poor remake of the original  it was also quite sexist and racist
Nov 6 2016,negative,this movie did not look good from the trailers and unfortunately it was not a good movie there were some funny parts but overall this movie was really not all the ladies have no chemistry with each other kate mckinnon is usually really funny but is really awkward the villain is embarrassingly bad here there were too many callbacks to the original where it was just distracting the cameos were horrible and the ending is so stupid the special effects were fine chris hemsworth was funny in the beginning but his imsodumbshtick got so old after awhile and i was really impressed with leslie jones this movie is needless and should not have been made so its just a waste of time
Nov 6 2016,positive,was a pretty good movie after all
Nov 6 2016,negative,the acting was not very good  its just a cast of comedians  imho it was an insult to the original greatness that was ghostbusters
Nov 6 2016,positive,great family movie im a huge fan of ghostbusters for years love the comedy and the movie pays great homage to the old  loved it
Nov 6 2016,negative,ghostbusters misses the mark in comedy and a good story it tries new things as well but cant utilize them properly
Nov 6 2016,positive,laughed out loud a bunch with this one
Nov 6 2016,positive,does not disappoint melissa mccarthy kristen wiig and kate mckinnon make this movie
Nov 6 2016,negative,not funny  political correctness kills humor  watch this movie if you want a perfect example
Nov 6 2016,negative,really the worst comedic writing ive seen in a long time  the only thing that pulled a chuckle out of me was the scene with the dean flipping them off  he should direct those fingers towards the writers
Nov 6 2016,positive,the characters are funny the gags rarely feel flat
Nov 6 2016,negative,i waited a long time before finally seeing this movie mainly because there was absolutely nothing on television last night i did hope that the naysayers would be wrong but the acting script writing and even special effects were all subpar    lacking a coherent and engaging story they decided to move from one underwhelming and predictable set piece to another    the original was not a perfect movie and certainly shows its age yet the quality of both the acting script and cinematography far outshines this latest incarnation despite 30 years having passed
Nov 5 2016,negative,suc boring as all get out  dry in most areas
Nov 5 2016,positive,chris hemsworth was awesome and the movie had overall good balance between comedy and action
Nov 5 2016,positive,of course we will never forget the original this is a great remake
Nov 5 2016,positive,actually really realyy enjoyed this movie great fun movie that was a tribute and good on its own
Nov 5 2016,negative,oldest daughter after a long awkward pause when this was finally overi just dont understand why after they read the script that they would be in this  was it money       maybe the worst movie i have ever seen in my life
Nov 5 2016,negative,good actors but the script was total shite
Nov 5 2016,negative,a bit indifferent the best part being the cameos of the old cast
Nov 5 2016,positive,that fallout boy song dough
Nov 5 2016,positive,this was definitely better than i expected it to be there were some solid jokes and only mild mockery of the original movie but honestly the best bit was the hemsworth dance number toward the end hilarious
Nov 5 2016,positive,good laughs with a few fun throw backs to the original worth a watch or two
Nov 5 2016,negative,far cry from the original wasnt even funny
Nov 5 2016,positive,one of the best remakes in our time
Nov 5 2016,negative,yeah not that great  rick moranis was right to skip his cameo in this one  i might be getting a little tired of melissa mccarthy movies  saying something is certified fresh should require that they provide something new and entertaining  this movie was an attempt to pay tribute to the 1980s movie while still trying to come up with a new script  homage was successfully paid  the script is just 1 rank above utter crap
Nov 5 2016,positive,mary didnt care for it 
Nov 4 2016,negative,was not impressed  very silly and odd acting
Nov 4 2016,negative,it is everything bad critics said  forced lines and horrible timing gave it 2 stars bc the blonde snl girl is good
Nov 4 2016,negative,one of the most boring movies ive ever seen i wasnt expecting it to be this bad
Nov 4 2016,neutral,it wasnt the women who ruined this movie it was the pg rating stupid movie studios
Nov 4 2016,negative,im a big fan of ghosts and haunted house movies when theyre scary theyre wonderful when theyre funny they can be charming when they can be funny and scary it can be a miracle unlike beetlejuice and the original ghostbusters this movie is a disappointment it could have had so much potential i really tried to like this movie it had a few funny moments some memorable quotes the special effects are far superior and most of the cast are passable however the major problem i have with it is that its just a retread of the original plot do you mean to tell me that in the years weve had since with tv shows exploring the paranormal that we cant make an entirely new ghostbusters without just ripping off the original plot inserting a few vomit and slime jokes and just completely embarrassing the cast with moronic lines and idiotic scenes the best part of the first movie is that it was hilarious for being played straight the humor coming from the characters reacting to each other and the phenomenon also the main cast had a purpose murray was the cynic aykroyd was the heart ramis the brain and hudson the everyman sigourney weaver was the straight man and moranis was the comic foil in this movie the cast comes across as someones dirty little fantasy as they somehow replicate piece by piece the same inventions and create the exact same work uniforms as the first movie its almost as if the characters saw the first movie and said well lets make one of those that works and dress like them too now i like kristen wiig shes one of the movies most likable redeeming features but melissa mccarthy is just woefully miscast ruining every scene shes in she is just freaking annoying but then thats what happens when you cast an actress who plays the same character in virtually every movie in which she stars she really might have worked better in kate mckinnons role and vice versa and then theres the tall sasquatchy actress i just cant recall her name ill just call her patty but she also seems miscast when she should have been playing one of the demonic entities this movie is passing off as ghosts the problem is the good jokes are immediately followed by bad jokes the socalled ghosts look more like scooby doo villains and the socalled villain is tacked on like as afterthought there is absolutely no followup to his appearance and his socalled apocalypse looks more like just some annoying inconvenience its just incredibly boring the worst part is that chris hemsworth is woefully underused and embarrassed by playing an affable idiot that by all rights would be in a special school than holding a job it would have been funnier if they had treated him like how guys have been treating women for the last fifty years for an interesting premise the plot focuses too hard on trying to be funny than staying on plot the jokes are predictable before they even land and some of them dont even land maybe if they had stayed on the plot instead of playing up the jokes the cameos of the original cast are kind of pointless the one by ozzy osbourne is really embarrassing for him the plot has holes in it that dont make sense how does rowan know hell become a ghost he could have gone directly into the afterlife for that matter the paranormal facts in this movie are nonexistent  it just seemingly makes stuff up as it goes along at least the original didnt stray offfield as much as this one does
Nov 4 2016,positive,theres a moment early on in paul feigs 2016 remake of ghostbusters encapsulating exactly why the film works so well scientists erin gilbert abby yates and jillian holtzman kristen wiig melissa mccarthy and kate mckinnon respectively have just encountered a ghost inside of a haunted mansion  holtzman is videotaping their reaction afterward and gilbert who hoping to be accepted by the legitimate  academic community has spent years distancing herself from the paranormal research she and yates had once embarked upon stares into the camera enthusiastically proclaiming ghosts are real  its an engaging moment effectively capturing the tone of the new film which is a goofy energized often laugh out loud funny addition to the ghostbusters canon  the story tracks essentially the same plot as the 84 film three scientists and one layperson join forces to use self designed technology to study and capture paranormal activity they are met with skepticism accusations of fraud and open humiliation but when a looming threat of apocalyptic proportions comes to their attention they realize they need to band together and face the danger in order to save the world  feig directs with a sure hand and the core cast of kristin wiig melissa mccarthy  kate mckinnon and leslie jones as patty tolan a transit employee and native new yorker whose knowledge of the citys history provides a needed balance to the others scientific capabilities are nothing short of fantastic the four women have a natural chemistry which translates well to the screen it helps that feig and screenwriter kate dippold delivered sharp crackling dialogue for these talented actresses to chew on  chris hemsworth is on hand as kevin an atrociously dumb receptionist who had me laughing throughout the movie this is a guy who covers his eyes when he hears a loud noise hemsworth demonstrates a previously unseen range here and a brillant gift for comedy when the plot requires him to shift gears and portray the character as being possessed by someone far more intelligent not a spolier it was in the trailer  the actor slips into the new persona effortlessy its an amazing performance  if theres a standout though it has to be mckinnon her unexpectedly quirky turn as the demented holtzman is absolutely the highlight of the entire film she never slips out of character and shes a pure joy to watch mckinnon consistently generates some of the biggest laughs and scores the most impressive visual moment of the picture during the climax when holtzman runs the gamut and goes on a solo ghostbusting rampage  that said i have a few grievances as well  first theres the matter of the cameos by the original cast all but two of them ernie hudson whos appearance was perfectly timed and made sense and annie potts whos allowed to deliver her famous what do you want line in a funny scene  seemed superfluous aykroyds was unncessary weavers was entirely tacked on and murray was given a slightly more susbstantial role but is in and out quickly to no great effect major points awarded in the plus column though for the bittersweet inclusion of a bust of harold ramis as egon spengler in the halls of columbia university the new film does a terrific job of paying homage to the original through stylistic choices and its core tone throughout this really feels like a genuine ghostbusters film without the needless walk ons  secondly theres the matter of the villain the character is named rowan and the idea behind him is actually a good one hes an introverted nebbish type who uses the same science abby and erin wrote about years earlier to design devices meant to usher in a new apoclaypse using ley lines  the problem is neil casey who portrays rowan in his early human form is terrible he isnt remotely funny hes bland and every time hes on screen the momentum of the film stops dead it says something that rowan becomes a better character later on only when chris hemsworth has to embody him for all of the hate its received over the years ghostbusters ii  which i actually enjoyed  had a superior and much much funnier variation on this type of character by way of peter mcnicol who was enslaved by viggo the carpathian rowan just wasnt that memorable of a villain  theres also the direction of of the film in the final act one of the reasons ghostbusters earned such a loyal fanbase is the original film is consistently dialogue driven throughout even during the climactic effects driven setpiece when the team faces gozer the gozarian the focus on having these four heroes exchange super funny rapid fire dialogue continued unabated even as they drew their weapons and faced down the stay puft marshwmallow man  in the new film the movie gets to certain point where the attemtps at snappy dialouge take a back seat and it becomes a standard issue visual effects extravaganza there are some good moments and the movie eventually finds its bearings again particulary during a series of scenes set during and after the end credits but it had maintained such a terrific consistent focus on the character exchanges up until that last half hour that i admit to being somewhat disappointed  having addressed that ill go ahead and get to the other issue hanging over this film the stupid ignorant useless misogynistic rampage people went on for three years before it even arrived in theaters  its a damned shame that happened because it cost what turned out to be an excellent film and a worthy welcome reboot of the franchise a chance to pave the way all because people couldnt handle the gender change  the irony is within the context of the film their gender doesnt even matter this is a story about four characters who happen to be women there is no male bashing not one moment in the film suggests they are superior to men or are doing this better because theyre female ive read some complaints that all the men the women encounter are hostile condescending buffoons but honestly you can say that about the male authority figures the guys in the first two films came up against  sadly for the time being it appears no sequel is planned because the box office wasnt what the studio had hoped for that sucks i would absolutely love to see these four characters and kevin return for a follow up where they are already established and can jump right in without any preconceived expectations particulary in the wake of a clever post credits stinger teasing zuul  the bottom line i didnt just like the new ghostbusters i loved it i thought it was sharp funny brilliantly cast and deftly directed i think its strengths manage to overcome a relatively weak villain and a climactic battle that was too bombastic for my taste feig and his cast have delivered a fun upbeat film about four clever funny and heroic women who have stepped up to assume the mantle as the 2st century superstars of the supernatural  i mentioned at the top of this review a scene capturing the essence of what makes this new ghostbusters great theres another during the end credits that just as perfectly sums up how i felt about it  in the scene patty runs into the room and tells her teammates they have to come up to the roof of their building and see whats happening outside the women rush up there only to be greeted by the breathtaking image of the nyc skyline at night thousands of windows lit up in buildings across the city spelling out messages of thanks to the ghostbusters and proclaiming nycs love for their new heroes  its a warm wonderful moment watching these four characters receive the recognition they  and this film so richly deserve  12 out of  stars answer the call
Nov 4 2016,negative,watched the movie it sucked only reason im even posting on here is to address the pure retardation of the argument that people dont like this movie because they are sexist if you think that youre a fucking piece of shit also look at how biased this shit is with movie critics a lot of them only gave it a good rating and praise because they didnt want to be called sexist by some idiots these people can just go fuck them selves but seriously uugggghhhhhhhh have a wonderful day non idiots out there  
Nov 4 2016,positive,awesome move who cares what others say i loved it   watch it and make your own decision   totally fun movie from start to finish  great lines
Nov 4 2016,negative,this is a truely terrible film  not funny boring and a ordinary plot  makes me wonder if critics were scared of being labelled misogynistic with some of the good reviews  i loved the original and maybe thats the issue because this is a pale comparison  wasnt expecting much given the audience reviews and was still disappointed  the only good thing was the special effects hardly a big thing these days
Nov 3 2016,negative,this movie was just plain dumb not even close to the original i dont think i cracked a smile  let alone laughed the entire film dry humor lame acting terrible effects even chris hemsworth was just plain stupid   the original will still make me laugh and had a great plot this  not even close
Nov 3 2016,negative,what many thought would be the headliner for the feminist movement turned out to be nothing more than a hypocritical disappointment of a movie the main core of actresses arent bad in the movie except kate mckinnon who focuses more on constantly trying to make jokes and failing rather than actually acting leslie jones elicits the most laughs in the movie and she may be the sole thing this movie has going for it it really trudges along for most of the movie despite a decent start and a fairly entertaining ending and the effects vary greatly going from impressive in one scene to downright terrible in the next it safe to say that even though we dont need nor should we want a sequel to this failed reboot but we will probably get one nonetheless
Nov 3 2016,negative,probably one of the worst movies i ever saw
Nov 3 2016,negative,really boring i actually fell asleep half way through melissa mccarthy is so funny but here she just fell very flat i really wanted to see so much more from her she just did not deliver for me i was very excited to watch this movie but it just really sucked the special effects however were very life like sadly this was the only enjoyable thing about this movie
Nov 3 2016,negative,this film left me with two questions   1 why was chris hemsworth the only funny character in this movie 2 just why  overall horrid
Nov 3 2016,positive,aside from some secondary characters being insufferably annoying i found it as enjoyable as the original two
Nov 2 2016,positive,i laughed a lot i loved it and thought the women did a great job dont know why everyone is hating on ita movie is suppose to entertain you  this movie did just that
Nov 2 2016,negative,this was the worst i cant believe i paid 599 for this from on demand i want my money back 
Nov 2 2016,negative,a bizarre soft reboot of the ghostbusters franchise not entirely unenjoyable but not as funny as it should have been given the snl backing and main actresses feig just cant make a movie that is good from start to finish could have been better either as a full reboot taking into consideration the events of the past movies or going off track and doing something completely new and cutting out the pointless cameos from past cast members
Nov 2 2016,negative,this wasok not this horrible atrocity that frothing ghostbusters puristsis that even a thing thought it would be perhaps wanted it to be   its just a mediocre movie i found almost all of the attempted humor to fall flat they were trying took hard   ive never liked melissa mccarthy and this doesnt change that shes obnoxious   i heard that kate mckinnons character made the movie but i didnt much like her either i like the idea behind the character but not how it was presented we cant just have a female tech geek she has to be an ultra strange over the top female tech geek trying too hard again   the pacing was off and how the new toys were introduced just baffled me its like no time went by but suddenly fancy new ghost busting gadgets keep showing up wouldnt these things take weeks months or longer to create   still overall its just a movie that just happens to have 4 female leads i commend that but the movie is still mediocre whiny men and nostalgia freaks baffle me the way they reacted to this movie being made was sad complain about bad movies after youve seen them not months before just because youre childhood is ruined or your manliness is threatened truly bizarre stuff
Nov 2 2016,positive,really good movie dont listen to the propaganda
Nov 2 2016,positive,honestly i dont see what all the criticism and backlash was about this is a pretty good movie in its own right it was often quite funny had some good characters i especially liked holtzmann abby and kevin and good action in it it would have been better if the effects were a touch more realistic and that dance scene just should not have happened and im a fan of dance numbers but yeah it was entertaining and worth a watch 
Nov 2 2016,positive,of course not as funny as the first ones but we knew that was not going to happen anyway funny entertained between 25 and 3 stars it does not deserve all the critics which has received kate mckinnon does it great
Nov 2 2016,positive,funny movie give it a shot
Nov 1 2016,positive,not as good as the original but not as bad as everyone was making it out to be have to say it was enjoyable
Nov 1 2016,positive,kate mckinnon and leslie jones were fantastic while melissa mccarthy and kristen wiig were disappointing it seems as if mccarthy is always yelling which might make her the female counterpart to will ferrell and wiig is always awkward some jokes worked and others fell flat not a must watch but still entertaining enough
Nov 1 2016,positive,a super fun and easy watch
Nov 1 2016,negative,the story paid homage to the original in a strange parallel but lacked cohesion as the antagonist became powerful at the end just because he wanted to the film seemed more in proving a point rather than providing a good story the all female cast was pitted against males with the intellect of a goldfish and if the point the film is making isnt driven home by the end it ends with the bad guy being shot in the d well i wont spoil it for you
Nov 1 2016,positive,this is a totally different movie comparing this to the original is a mistake these ladies held their own loved it
Nov 1 2016,negative,awful film used solely as a vessel to propel the feminist agenda a disappointment at best
Nov 1 2016,positive,script was mighty linear and there were hardly any villains
Nov 1 2016,negative,this is one of the worst movies ive ever seen steer clear
Nov 1 2016,negative,im tired of hearing how if you didnt like the movie youre sexist  the movie just sucks the cast is a group of very funny ladies that i have enjoyed in pretty much everything ive seen them in it felt forced and was poorly written would have been way better as a sequel with this cast
Nov 1 2016,positive,actually better than i thought
Nov 1 2016,positive,nothing to great but a fun movie to watch
Nov 1 2016,positive,very fun with its cast being a highlight im sure however that i would have enjoyed it much more if i had managed to watch the original first
Nov 1 2016,positive,ghostbusters is visually engaging and hilarious but most of all incredibly fun thanks to its accomplished cast and brilliant script i was never a fan of the original 1984 blockbuster but this reboot changed my mind as it is highly enjoyable and in my opinion better for its leading ladies are top notch comedians who delivered excellent performances
Nov 1 2016,positive,it is a very funny comedy with loads of action and it very fun to watch
Oct 31 2016,positive,it was okay i liked the cameo from the original cast members and kate mckinnons impersonation of egon made her her my favorite character outside of a few things here and there such as better graphics and the origins of the logo this film barely stands a chance at holding a candle in the shadows of its predecessor
Oct 31 2016,negative,this movie should not have been made they tried but it sucked
Oct 31 2016,positive,it was a feminist remake plain and simple  the only thing misogynistic is the folks who approved the making of this film  i would have had no problem if they were the daughters taking over the company from their parents but a remake  really  if anything the film was misandrist  now after all thatthe film wasnt as bad as i expected it to be  it kept my attention and i laughed a bit  but i am praying there is no part ii
Oct 31 2016,positive,it was ok but really would of loved it to be a reboot continuation of the old films like star wars did
Oct 31 2016,negative,jokes were very lame and the whole thing was very predictable
Oct 31 2016,positive,everything about this is movie is ok  the masses of online haters should really find some other movie from this summer to point their proverbial pitchforks at  however im not exactly clamoring for the inevitable sequel
Oct 30 2016,negative,im not anti women but this movie sucks total waste of movie budget should have sticked to the original male castings
Oct 30 2016,positive,funny and smart loved the ladies kept me interested contagious laughter and good special effects this ones a winner
Oct 30 2016,neutral,all the build up of finally getting a new ghostbusters and all the let down of flat performances by wiig and mccarthy story wasnt very developed almost no back story of any kind that was worth watching best parts of this movie were the special effects kate mckinnon and leslie jones
Oct 30 2016,positive,hilarious brilliant and badass
Oct 30 2016,positive,loved it brought me back and stayed true to the originals
Oct 30 2016,positive,really funny awesome female cast
Oct 30 2016,neutral,it was okay  but not as good as the original the girl acted too goofy i think there was a scene at the end where i believe they adlibbed and it was just dumb
Oct 30 2016,negative,an aweful movie plot made little sense special effects were a joke  an aweful film
Oct 30 2016,positive,i thought the experience was fun engaging campy and nostalgic
Oct 30 2016,negative,i would rather have a root canal than watch that again
Oct 30 2016,positive,super fun great cast chemistry
Oct 30 2016,negative,shit is rocking the most predictable and typical comedy cliches and jokes that even fiveyearolds dont find funny anymore a real struggle to watch
Oct 30 2016,positive,i went into this not expecting to like it and came out pleasantly surprised   the new ghostbusters is an updated take on the beloved films from the 80s while a mostly female cast  the film pays respect to its predecessors but has enough of a new twist to make it feel fresh at the same time  the cgi effects are great  and lend well to viewing in 3d  worth adding to your watch list
Oct 30 2016,negative,wanted to like it but wasnt funny and the attempts to make it so brought the rest of the movie down too
Oct 30 2016,positive,we here at the local movie gallery would like to give this flick a its worth checking out rating   obviously it is a remake of a classic movie and therefore will have to work really hard to live up to certain expectations we just didnt feel as if the story line was very interesting we also didnt feel like the characters ever got deep enough to make them memorable also chris hemsworths character was annoying but we do have this title available to rent its here now guaranteed  check us out at 
Oct 30 2016,negative,i cant believe i wasted money on this  
Oct 30 2016,positive,the most endearing aspect of this film is the manner in which these four talented women stare down the unabashed and disturbing vitriol of abuse and anger visited upon them by little boys and little men with lovely cheeky chemistry mckinnon and mccarthy in particular have a zany and offkilter partnership that lifts the film enormously unfortunately these elements of the film prove to be far more interesting and compelling than their ghostbusting the special effects and the surprisingly empty characterisation moments of joy and subversion from these four powerful women come too sporadically and there is little here that feels anything more than predictable and safe its strange but for all the wrong reasons
Oct 30 2016,negative,movie made with ez gov grant money to highlight women
Oct 29 2016,negative,ill give it an additional bonus star for making me laugh a few times
Oct 29 2016,negative,overly acted and outta control
Oct 29 2016,negative,special effects are great cameos are amazing  nostalgic but the movie feels more like a feminist version of ghostbusters instead of a serious comedy about busting ghost  talented actresses who could have had a better script  director
Oct 29 2016,negative,ok missed so many chances to segue from the original i mean you land bill murray and dan akroyd and cast them as different characters  boo  a better transition would have made it better instead is was pretty one dimensional and mostly boring
Oct 29 2016,negative,this movie got a pg13 rating the writing is atrocious and the humor is so suggestive and dirty the mpaa shouldve been debating if this movie should be rated r or nc17 people like me were right to be trashing this movie even before it was first released if the ratings would let me give zero stars i would but i suppose it does deserve at least half a star for the better cgi
Oct 29 2016,negative,its a tremendous shame how terrible this movie is
Oct 29 2016,positive,watched the movie and thought it was great i like the references to the old movies
Oct 29 2016,positive,love it very funny and worth seeing again
Oct 29 2016,negative,this movie was just awful dont care if it has female cast or not jokes just werent funny at all
Oct 29 2016,neutral,the plot is to similar to the original they had an opportunity to do something new and different and that may have worked so much better jokes were not funny and was just waiting for movie to end could have been  so much better
Oct 29 2016,neutral,another unnecessary reboot some are pretty good others are really bad this qualifies as the latter the cameos are the best part of the movie
Oct 29 2016,positive,would like to say has a few more cuss words then expected and the uhh little birdie finger right up in your face
Oct 29 2016,neutral,calm down youtube  everybody knows the original ghostbusters the gang from 84 that stood up in the face of the paranormal theyre original if you dont count the tv series from the 70s but i digress  getting the reboot treatment we have the same basic premise with a brand new cast and guess what theyre all women  this movie has already faced a ton of backlash and it has the notoriety of having the most disliked trailer in youtube history  people get so defensive whenever anything from their childhood gets ruffled which is exactly what happened here  i like ghostbusters as much as the next guy but i never harbored hatred for them remaking this movie  let me just jump out and tell you this movie certainly has its fair share of problems but the one item that isnt an issue is that this is the all female cast its actually one of the strongest things this movie has going for it and i personally believe there is a lot of thinly veiled sexism running rampant around these parts  i think these girls have a lot of chemistry together  i am a wellknow melissa mccarthy hater i dont think shes untalented i just find her vulgar crass shtick to be one note and the quality movies she does make like st vincent are few and far between  shes actually not bad here and she and kristen wiig share a good back and forth together  i like leslie jones as well but i wasnt a giant fan of kate mckinnon in this she didnt feel like she was written to be a real person and came across more of a cartoon character more than anything  i also really like chris hemsworth here who is playing this airhead of epic proportions and ive never seen him play a character like this before its unexpected very similar to jon hamms character in 30 rock and it leads to a number of this movies funniest moments  what ends up being the major issue with this movie is the fact that this is a studio movie  when you think of the definition of studio movie you probably think of lots of interference by big wigs who think they know best trying to inject their own personal touches whenever they can  it ends up feeling like they never believed in the ability of these girls and they needed to  remember how much advertising for the avengers movie there was in iron man 2  thats the same exact feeling i got here and there is so many references and callbacks to the original ghostbusters that it gets distracting  i know they thought that it was fan service but it ends up feeling more like awkward crowbarring than anything  this started off stronger than i expected but the more it went on the more i was ready for it to be over  i got light chuckles but nothing big  there are 3d effects that dont really translate all that well to the small screen but thats a nitpick compared to the other shortcomings of this movie  theres a lot of overexplaining and i wish they had the conviction to go in their own direction without feeling obligated to try and please everybody because when you do that you end up pleasing nobody
Oct 29 2016,negative,i watched it in red box unfunny stupid those girls has to stay snl forever they are not up the the big screen i did not finish watching the movie it seems that movie script was written by a 12 year old an insult to my intelligence  kate is a disaster i want my 3 back
Oct 28 2016,neutral,not really funny but entertaining
Oct 28 2016,positive,watched the extended version with kids probably not a good parent decision i enjoyed it and laughed several times
Oct 28 2016,negative,really wish i could give it a lower score i finally saw this it was the extended edition and it was still the stupidest thing ive seen in a long time the humor or comedy was so horrible forced and not at all funny nearly every joke revolved around some kind of sexual reference way to show girl power by making it completely trashy great job writers the original ghostbusters movies didnt feel forced the humor wasnt lame punchline attempts the actors had a way to take it serious without taking it serious to just let the personality of their characters be the comedy this movie is like one of those bad cliche films like scary movie or not another teen movie etc where its really trying desperately almost screaming to the audience laugh at this joke its stupid oneliner after stupid oneliner there was a very rare 2 or 3 moments of genuine good writingcomedy and those moments were not punchline moments or sex jokes they were more natural character moments the plot itself could actually make a better film if they had decent writers and halfdecent actors unfortunately this film delivers like congress forcing itself on the people against their will and not even seeing the problem with that trashy garbage attempts at humor pretty much sum up where this movie should stay lost in a gutter somewhere
Oct 28 2016,negative,sadly this movie is a disappointment
Oct 28 2016,positive,good jokes and fun to watch
Oct 28 2016,negative,not funny they try so hard to be funny every joke fell flat on its face acting is grade school at best the fact that rotten rated this 70 confirms their rating system is flawed ill stick with imdb    ill give it an extra star for nostalgia
Oct 27 2016,positive,it was better than i thought it would be 
Oct 27 2016,neutral,long  clumsy  unfunny  it spent so much time trying to be nostalgic it forgot to make great characters with convincing humor  im now haunted by over two hours of hearing melissa mccarthys shrieks and screams i cannot get out of my head chris hemsworth was the accidental hero of the cast  it could have been so much more
Oct 27 2016,negative,really wish they never made a reboot but instead just made a paul feig movie because his movies werent bad but this one is just horrible and forgettable
Oct 27 2016,positive,did enough to stand on its own all that fuss made that more of a surprise than an observation though
Oct 27 2016,negative,goodness gracious great balls of unfunnyness  how could it be possible to have all of the ghouly life and fun be sucked out of an all female redo of ghostbusters  as a wee young tot i loved watching the ghostbusters cartoon every saturday morning and when i finally watched the original ghostbusters movies they were hammy campy fun saw the tail end of ghostbusters 2 recently and man oh man were the fx bad  what a difference 17 years makes  so what was i expecting from ghostbusters 2016 gangnamlady style    ill give you a clue its a three letter word  have already used it twice  give it a shot  bingo fun  so if it wasnt fun what did it turn out to be   an unfunny bore where the first 75 of the movie is barely ghoul showing all supernatural  paranormal sciencefying smartly and semibelievably mumblejumbling jargon barely moving character building  set up all for the last 30 mins of actual ghostbustering ghostbusting   which  in all honestly  was pretty visually and fx gripping where  watching it on dvd the ghosts visibly pop out at you in 3d even though it wasnt viewed in 3d    alas i wish the fun and funniness of ghostbusters could have snapped crackled and popped into 3d  blaséingly it ended up being a subpar 2d flick  lets look at the talent that went into this modernizing of ghostbusters  1 director paul feig  whose directorial successes of bridesmaids spy the heat  tvs the office and nurse jackie would make you think that he could have done it more justice then what was served  2 writers paul feig and katie dippold who wrote many an ep of madtv parks and rec and the heat  3 funny woman melissa mccarthy  whos character is the most sanest grounded and rational one of the ladies   4 a trio of hilarious saturday night live ladies  kristen wiig leslie jones and the wacky goofball of the bunch kate mckinnon  i dont know if it was the script or whether they were allowed to improv lines or what but rarely anything that came out of their mouths was truly funny    5 cameos by the original ghostbusters bill murray whose character here is a so dry and unfun id rather be watching someone put together a puzzle  or watch baseball dan aykroyd ernie hudson annie potts and  in the ending credits sigourney weaver  6 a less hulky thor chris hemsworth playing as stupid as stupid gets with meh overall results  7 appearances by slimer and stay puff marshmallow man and the classic ghostbuster mobile  put all of the above into a ninja blender and youd think youd get  at bare minimum  a pretty enjoyable smoothie of fun  regrettably you would be mistaken as what it results in being is a joyless spilt bottle of barely palatable baby food
Oct 27 2016,positive,wanted to hate but cant say it was bad stayed so close to the originals plot you knew what would happen next cameos were a nice nod to the original cast only real fuck up was holtzmanns character just fucking annoying
Oct 27 2016,positive,growing up i loved the cartoon and this movie perfectly fit in that world for me the characters are hilarious and after we get past the introduction which felt a little long it becomes the funny ghostbusting adventure i wanted to see and experience holtzman is the standout character but with kate mckinnon thats to be expected this is a ghostbusters movie you can watch with your kids
Oct 27 2016,positive,when i saw the trailer for this remake i let out an audible groan however i am happy to say that it exceeded my expectations the women are as a cohesive an ensemble as were the men from the original version i knew wiig and mccarthy were capable of being funny but the real standouts in this movie for me were kate mckinnonwho i think is going to have a decent movie career and leslie jones who both proved that they have the comedic and acting chops to not get overshadowed by their more well known castmates it is a completely different plotline and different characters than those in the original but the had the respect to find practically every living original cast memberexcept rick moranis for very welcomed cameos add to it the awesome special effects and you have a movie that is well worth your time
Oct 27 2016,negative,to give ghostbusters 2 a lower rating then this travesty of a film is beyond me it was bad and critics should be ashamed  you wanted it to be good for girl power and such look at this film it was awful
Oct 27 2016,positive,i loved it cute funny charming lots of nods to the original but the new cast of funny strong women is so refreshing for hollywood
Oct 26 2016,positive,the movie was great the comedy was good the timings was good patty was nothing like the trailers made her look the cast was likeable the villain had good motivations and what surprises me the most the horror bits really work  they were honestly creepy ive heard complains about the cgi and i get where they come from but i dont think this ghost were suppose to look more realistic than they look in this movie they are well ghosts i heard the movie lost money and that is sad but in all honestly the trailer was awful and did not justice to the final product which is a very solid product i actually hope they do make a sequel despite the loses
Oct 26 2016,positive,i actually really enjoyed it fanboys need to chill a bit aha
Oct 26 2016,negative,not funny the plot was awful the specialeffects were cheesy the character development was off didnt care for anyone no one paid me to give this a positive review so you get the truth
Oct 26 2016,neutral,interesting use of the gender swap but ultimately this film fails to deliver not as funny or innovative as the original and just makes the 6 laugh test barely
Oct 26 2016,negative,biggest mistake hollywood did bringing this film back out with women no disrespect but it was never going to work and they had been warned  idiots
Oct 26 2016,negative,it was a meh experience i cant even remember 90 of the movie
Oct 26 2016,negative,you ruined my childhood who authorizes the remakes of these movies such a bad movie please do not make a squeal the movie is bad  how desperate the producers are in the need of money no creativity at all
Oct 26 2016,positive,it was actually pretty entertaining if you can seperate this which is  completely different movie from the original and just watch it as any other movie youll enjoy it
Oct 26 2016,negative,this new incarnation of ghostbusters manages not to be as bad as it looked especially when riding on the heels of the original 1984 comedic treasure but despite its best efforts it still turned out lame     sure it has a good cast with chris hemsworth and kate mckinnon being the highlights i also liked leslie jones in her role too bad they were let down by lackluster writing forced humor glitzy visual effects and an uncompelling villain kind of a shame since i enjoyed feigs previous work freaks and geeks bridesmaids and hoped that the film would progressively become funnier as it goes there were a few funny gags but most of the jokes missed the mark moreover this rebootsequelwhatever it is seemed to miss in its relentless efforts to capture the spirit of the originals ordinary people bound together by rejection science friendship and the paranormal yet also facing the boundless unknown with their limited resources while this premise was conveyed spoton something still felt off about the whole affair it felt empty and soulless instead of organic and relatable    sadly this movie got busted by its own means and the power beams of expectations helped trap it in the box oh well better luck next time
Oct 25 2016,negative,only gets half a star as it doesnt allow me to give a zero mark a truly awful film not funny not scary not worth your time
Oct 24 2016,negative,i went into the movie with an open mind  i love the actors and most of paul feigs movies but this was just painful boring and for some reason it just didnt click  i think way too much focus on the new shiny visual effects and not enough on making us care about these characters  big dissapointment
Oct 24 2016,positive,possibly as many laughs as the original ghostbusters although the storyline in this film is a bit more flatlined the leading ladies are all well cast and funny together hemsworth plays his role flawlessly nostalgic to watch and they did a great job of keeping the franchise integrity harold ramos would be proud rating 750  10
Oct 24 2016,positive,utterly hilarious movie that pays homage to the original awesome job ladies for creating something for a new generation of fans that can be appreciated by the prior generation
Oct 24 2016,positive,ghostbusters is just bright bold energetic and quirky enough to overcome slipshod writing poor use of todays funniest female comedians blatant product placement and being both offensively sexist while painfully unfunny
Oct 24 2016,neutral,it is no secret i think original is one of the most overrated films ever  will never understand its enduring popularity so i went into this only because i am a huge fan of all 4 women it was mildly entertaining and the reason why was them  they elevated the subpar material  given a more character and storydriven screenplay think of what a great picture these for could make together
Oct 24 2016,positive,this was a funny movieenjoyed the cast
Oct 24 2016,positive,fun fun fun necessarily campy and kooky a yes yes please for me the most fun ive knowingly had with a reboot
Oct 24 2016,negative,wasnt sure what to expect going in but have to say that there were only a couple moments when i actually laughed when i should have been laughing throughout chris hemsworth was one of the best parts of this movie he looked like he was just having a great time making it everyone else seemed like they were forced to be there and didnt seem to enjoy it there were a few of the newer gadgets that were interesting but overall it was just kinda boring for about 80 of the movie
Oct 24 2016,negative,there were a handful of moments where i chuckled out loud mostly thanks to chris hemsworth but beyond that this film didnt do much for me
Oct 24 2016,negative,ghostbusters is a movie that didnt deserve all the hate it got not because it was better than expected but because it was so pointless dull and forgettable that it barely warrants any comment at all    stilted dialogue and awkward conversations that were supposed to pass as comedy missed the mark entirely and left the film feeling like a series of badly timed scenes that some poor editor had to string together into a movie youd think that with a room full of comedians some hilarity would ensue but no it was about as funny as holidays with your inlaws its that kind of awkward    i had my hopes set on mckinnon to save the day with her quirky im not egon character but even that performance fell flat she came off as just weird instead of quirky and not in a good way    the movie however is not a total loss there are a few chuckles to be had along the way but they are so few and far between that the desert between them seems that much more barren    my verdict watch it if you want to especially if you can get it for cheap and are wondering what all the fuss was about in my opinion it deserves no fuss at all either positive or negative    fans of the original filmwill find their time better spent by watching the original
Oct 24 2016,positive,the ghosts are real and the scientists are hunting them down    first of all i am not a fan of the original film but i enjoyed watching them so i anticipated this film for the updates to deliver what im looking for including some good jokes but i found it an average film i am very interested to have the womens version of hit the films and vice versa but there are not many films in this category all i wanted was the expendables but they made this one i think it was a great idea though the execution was really impressive    the story was okay type they kept it very simple no big developments except two main characters but all the four women were good along with chris hemsworth as a worthy sidekick the director whose favourite casting actress melissa mccarthys fourth film with him in four years and he did his job well but the screenplay lets the film down    theres no major comparison with the original because this is a reboot and obviously has similar appeal from visual to comedies except they talk too much science thing because of todays advanced science the disappointments are the ghosts the film did not give preference for them to show their atrocities i mean the perspective was always from the women gang who fights them definitely a one time watchable film for its decent graphics performances and some good comedies    610
Oct 24 2016,neutral,there are some good bits here but mostly it failed to even come close to the original considering the talent there should have been more laughs and considering the time in between movies the story and effects could have been much better kate mckinnon was the best part of this and i hope to see her in more stuff
Oct 24 2016,negative,what a piece of shit  thats the most respectful thing i can say about this movie
Oct 24 2016,positive,the first 40min is clever and funny but then it deteriorates into a main stream bad movie
Oct 24 2016,negative,so good i couldnt watch it all
Oct 24 2016,positive,very funny the four main actreses are very funny and havd wonderful chemistry the story is good chris hemsworth is a hoot as the secretary great special effects and some good scares makes this female reboot if 1984 ghostbusters a must see
Oct 23 2016,negative,what a pile of crap    remake reboot re whatever you want but please make it watchable  ughjustawful
Oct 23 2016,negative,i wasnt a big fan  the main characters are likeable enough but most of the dialogue was awful  i think this might have been better if the writing wasnt so lazy  i felt like something was missing  it wasnt very funny either which  surprised me a tiny bit because of the women involved  all in all this is a pretty forgettable movie  once was enough
Oct 23 2016,negative,this movie was fucking stupidâ  stick to the original cast or leave it shelve the people behind the making of this shoulder be lined up and shot â 
Oct 23 2016,negative,i guess kudos to all involved for single handedly ruining one of the most iconic films of the eighties this is such a shambles im surprised it gets any recognition compared to the classic original
Oct 23 2016,positive,i enjoyed the reboot unfortunately like all superhero movies it had to stage an overthetop ending
Oct 23 2016,negative,best part of the movie was the cameos wasnt bad enough to turn off but think that was more for nostalgia to see what they were going to do with it the jokes are terrible and maybe laughed all of 3 times the final fights were redicilous and boring kristen wiigs character was more annoying than anything else    and kate mckinnonshudder was terrified what was going to come out of her mouth next when she was in screen    morbid curiosity and nostalgia was the only thing that kept this live
Oct 23 2016,negative,what a horrible movie do you think they could possibly cram one more snl cast member in and why give every surviving cast member a cameo in the movie   why not just build a movie around peter venkman and raymond stantz who come out of retirement to save new york again  terrible terrible movie even my 14 year old thought it was a stupid movie
Oct 23 2016,positive,i really wasnt looking forward to this review in the slightest  in fact i was loathing this review  theres one reason for that and that is the fact that you cannot review this movie without talking about the backlash it suffered from fans of the original movie which is one of the stupidest backlash to any films i have ever seen  i dont think theres been a backlash for a movie that hadnt actually been released at the time as this one  it was fucking massive and people were actually hoping for it to fail at the box office they wanted it to be a terrible movie and they also decided to boycott it as if it was something that they had to take a moral stance on  these people decided that they wanted to take a stupid movie about ghost hunters seriously  and what i mean by stupid is the fact that the concept of the film is silly and not meant to be taken seriously at all  some people even wanted to talk about the lore of ghostbusters as to why this remake was an abomination  seriously  lore  for fucking ghostbusters  like this was game of thrones which has a large and rich backstory replete with complex characters  i think nostalgia was very important to these people and they remember ghostbusters from their childhood  ill be honest i did enjoy the original movie no doubt about it but i didnt feel like it was a masterpiece like many have proclaimed it is  age just hasnt been kind to the movie  im sorry but thats just the way i felt  and i know this will be blasphemous to fans of the original but i felt that this was about on the same level as the original from an overall quality standpoint  the original was consistently funnier than this one for sure but both movies are equally enjoyable at least to me  look i have no problem if you gave the remake a fair shot and then you didnt end up liking it  there were people that were supportive of this that didnt end up liking it  what shouldnt be tolerated is people who refuse to watch the film throwing out opinions as if they actually watched it or have any knowledge of the content within it  either that or people who attack the cast for their physical appearance milo y human garbage as an example who got banned off twitter for harassing leslie jones and making fun of her appearance  if you have problems with the film they shouldnt be directed at the leads because they really are the best part of the film  all the women in this film are funny their chemistry is really strong and they make the film better than it should be realistically speaking  kate mckinnon really needs to be a major player in comedy films for years to come  she is tremendous  i thought paul feig was the best person to head up this film but theres no denying that this is a bit of a comedown from his previous movie spy which i felt was excellent  i think its the fact that he had to follow a guideline since this film thematically speaking hits a lot of the same notes as the original movie  maybe they were forced to work within that framework and thats why the film doesnt really push the envelope as much as it could  i still think paul and kate dippold did a good job with this world and they added in their little touches to at the very least try to differentiate it from the original movie  its not differentiated that much but it still has its own unique little touches  i was a big fan of the third act when all of the ghosts are released into new york  its definitely more actionheavy than i would have anticipated but i liked it  they had a lot of fun ideas as to what to do with the ghosts in this segment and they made it work  the movie isnt perfect obviously  its not as consistently funny as it probably should have been but thats all a matter of perspective i guess  some people coming in with an unbiased viewpoint will find this to be the unfunniest film of the year and others will find it to be the funniest  i dont see what either of those people see i fall somewhere in the middle  its not hilarious but it is a pretty good little summer flick  its got a great cast who are all clearly having a blast doing what theyre doing a quick pace and a fun tone  for those who hated the film before they even saw one trailer this clearly wont convince you of anything  particularly if youre a fanboy that refuses to see how age hasnt been kind to the original movie  but if you think that this is more of an abomination to the ghostbusters franchise than ghostbusters 2 a worse film than both the original and the remake then i dont know what to tell you  you probably like grown ups 2 as well and if that is the case then youre not the type of person i want to know  i thought this was a fun movie and i dont give a fuck if the fanboys dont like that
Oct 23 2016,negative,every time the movie started to pick up with some cool action or scene that engaged you they would start some stupid standup bit that would just take you right out of the movie  the movie was very contrived  the cameos were cool i thought but nothing in the dialogue felt natural  lets just say i didnt really finish iti started doing the dishes  i really hope they dont do a sequel
Oct 23 2016,positive,well my teenage daughter loved it and laughed all the way through it a number of homages and original cast appearances as expected but the new cast allows it to go in another direction as well as freshly balance out the decidedly male centered original comedy classic
Oct 23 2016,positive,better than i thought it would be hoping they make a second one
Oct 23 2016,negative,essentially a very long characteristically lame snl sketch
Oct 23 2016,positive,loved the movie didnt like the language tho it was a little disappointing that way but it was a really good and spooky
Oct 23 2016,negative,i was really hoping for minimum a few good chuckles i think i laughed maybe twice i almost gave up on it but i am a trooper   bottom line no where near the quality or hilarity of the originals
Oct 23 2016,negative,its funny in brief moments and offers some expected nostalgia but its a clear downgrade from the original in both the humor department and in the reach of its socialpolitical commentary it also suffers from the struggle of any remake there isnt much new ground to break and the talent involved winds up being squandered on something that isnt really necessary
Oct 23 2016,positive,50 times better than that new ninja turtles shit
Oct 23 2016,negative,so bad not clever not funny
Oct 23 2016,negative,utter rubbish the original movie was vastly better even now
Oct 23 2016,positive,it was good get over yourselves
Oct 23 2016,negative,the main thing that standed out to me is how sloppy the movie seemed story felt very copied and thrown together the villain and ghosts are uninspired there are some funny scenes with a great comedic cast but far more completely bomb
Oct 23 2016,positive,it was not as good as the original but more family friendly
Oct 23 2016,positive,i thought this was a good movie it capured the spirit of the original movies with a lot of references to those movies without being obvious about it i personally dont see why it got so many poor reviews so i thought i would give it a try and i really enjoyed it i suggest you do the same   
Oct 23 2016,positive,better then expected but not scary
Oct 23 2016,positive,loved the original love the reboot
Oct 22 2016,negative,its a comedy that didnt make my wife nor i laugh three soup jokes thats just an example and i understand the extended edition adds multiple dance numbers   great
Oct 22 2016,positive,i just saw this i thought it was incredibly fun and funny i dont see what the hate is aboutother than the very evident result of paid trolls and bots i really loved the cameos in this and the story itself is pretty entertaining i wouldve loved to have a sequel to this given that last tease in the end about zuul and theyre back in the firehouse although admittedly i like the set design of the chinese place a lot anyway as a kid who grew up with the original ghostbuster movies and the original 80s cartoons im very happy with this movie i just wished the h8terz didnt get to it and ruined it for the rest of us     hollywood you have a paid negativity problem and its ruining so many of what couldve been good products that people wouldve enjoyed maybe its high time to criminalize such actions this is your investment on the line after all
Oct 22 2016,neutral,in a word meh wasnt horrible wasnt great  the special effects we good but a little over the top for ghosts  the story felt rushed to me and i didnt really feel in the moment while watching  i wished they did more with kristen wiig i like her as a comedian but they really didnt giver her much to work with  my favorite was kate mckinnon she was the right kinda a weird for this movie
Oct 22 2016,positive,it was a very excellent movie and i liked it
Oct 22 2016,positive,overall i thought this was a decent comedy  i got a good amount of laughs from it  im not sure if id watch it again though  710
Oct 22 2016,negative,i have never been more pissed of and annoyed at a film im all my life as i am with the new ghostbusters its a shambles and a disgrace to the original and never should have been made not to mention a friggin insult to the original
Oct 22 2016,negative,flat had a lot of potential came up way short dont waste your time wait for it on netflix
Oct 22 2016,positive,you cant compare this or any movie to the original this movie takes place in another world where those characters and movie dont exist not a bad movie by any means it gets a bad rap because too many people like the original the sad thing is this is a comedy and action movie featuring 4 strong women and female audiences failed to support it yet they complain more movies like this dont get made and thats really a shame
Oct 22 2016,negative,a corny prodigy of the original at best
Oct 22 2016,neutral,although not quite as terrible as i thought it would be ghostbusters is a movie based on a classic that at the end of the day didnt need to exist
Oct 22 2016,positive,if you can get over this is a reboot then you will like this movie
Oct 22 2016,negative,just a slightly better than average remake of a slightly better than average popcorn flick   all with perhaps a slightly more aggressive pcgirlpower marketing slant than usual  sure they castrate a ghost and stuff every feminists dream but ultimately nothing struck me as either particularly agregious or particularly interesting
Oct 22 2016,positive,hilariously funny  i can only guess the only ones who thought this wasnt funny are those who miss the absolute beauty that is chris hemsworth  happy sigh hes not brad pitt beautiful but close enough    seriously though with a female flare  this is one of the funniest movies this year and family friendly  loved it      nobody hurts kevin man nobody
Oct 22 2016,negative,worst remake everwhy
Oct 22 2016,positive,it was a great remake and agreat cast
Oct 22 2016,positive,one of the best films of the year all the sexist gays should go burn in hell ghostbusters was an awesome film with great humor and great action highly recommend watch this other than secret life of pets
Oct 22 2016,positive,kate mckinnon and leslie jones are amazing while kristin wiig and mellissa mccarthy are their usual top notch in this funny stand alone version of gb the screenplay is amazing funny quick and sharp and the editing helps make the little things work oh and chris hemsworth shows again that he is a great comedic actor in his own right
Oct 22 2016,positive,a bit unfairly marginalized in my opinion long review short i love the original 1984 ghostbusters and i like this new one it aint perfect but hey even ghostbusters 2 was disliked by many and i liked that one too
Oct 21 2016,positive,the casting is the best thing this movie was rebooted too soon
Oct 21 2016,positive,love the idea on the remake i can agree with the special guests very solid reminder of the first one love the continuity to snl  all the homework aside i had trouble with the screen transition and the pace of the movie cast aside i had some trouble to the laugh out loud moments its like were set up for a slam dunk and we missed  i say this because the cast is solid maybe its a stretch to be close to the original movie with interludes of the second  right idea mediocre deliverance end of the day im a fan because of my loyalty to snl
Oct 21 2016,negative,melissa mccarthy and kristen wiig were terrible the blonde crazy one was funny the originals were way better hollywood should not be allowed to take great movies and try to reboot them they shouldve made the 3rd movie with the original cast while harold ramis was still alive
Oct 21 2016,positive,a lot of tell and not show didnt really use the rule of threes when it came to callbacks and hints but overall a solid show  the last third and especially the big action scene were amazing i love kate mckinnons character but the set up was a bit rushed and the pacing was off  in the end it didnt deserve the bad reception that it got worse movies have done better
Oct 21 2016,negative,boo srry did i scare you its october  you know what that means  slutoween  send this to 10 of your 10 sluttiest ghost bitches  if you get 5 back youre a slutty witch but if you get 10 ur the spookiest bitch on the block    im glad the original did not come out during my childhood
Oct 21 2016,positive,well cast written and executed a simple fun movie that stands on its own and also gives an ode to the past
Oct 21 2016,positive,i love the paranormal just like a movie
Oct 21 2016,neutral,this movie reaffirms how good the four leads yes even leslie jones are as actresses   i am really warming up to mckinnon   she looked like she was having so much fun in this movie   that said this was nothing more than an obvious and desperate cash in for all involved  it just felt very cheap and lame but the four leads hold it together   oh hemsworth is lucky he is an already established actor because he was awful
Oct 21 2016,positive,previews led me to believe it wouldnt keep me entertained or would be to stupid slapstick to be funny however it ended up being one of my favorite movies of the year well written story and interesting characters that kept me laughing throughout
Oct 21 2016,positive,a harmless reboot that will satisfy more tolerant viewers
Oct 21 2016,positive,was ok kind of flat
Oct 21 2016,positive,its a dream cast of funny people kate mckinnon and leslie jones are gold with the added bonus of excellent special effects my niece especially loved it
Oct 21 2016,negative,terrible a star was added for a few good action scenes but an overall bad movie full of cliches and an insult to the original
Oct 21 2016,negative,nothing is new a rehash of the first film except just plain awful this movie completely disregards its original fan base with low class humor and stereotypical characterization
Oct 21 2016,negative,not great not horrible but as a whole id say this was a flop even with 4 outstanding and hilarious leading ladies the laughs were very few and far between jokes were dry i did appreciate the cameos of original characters from the older gb movies but thnx ill stick with dan and bill
Oct 21 2016,positive,very funny movie awesome movie to watch with family
Oct 21 2016,negative,a movie that felt like an extended snl skit with a lot of cameos that constantly took you out of the movie i enjoyed parts of it and laughed a few times but large in part although progressive in the sense that it is led by great female actresses it was a mediocre film at best
Oct 21 2016,positive,just watched it and thought it was phenomenal loved how fresh it was and that they were respectful enough to include the original cast to some capacity great fun from start to finish hoping for a sequel only downside was chris hemsworth did not like him in it but other than that the movie was funny epic and well worth the watch people who hate the movie need to grow up and realise that the original cast did their bit for the first two films and time for new generations to get something new
Oct 21 2016,positive,this movie was a great time fun laughs and plot
Oct 21 2016,negative,no why would you do this to a classic this movie is a disgrace
Oct 21 2016,negative,these girls are all capable of funny but this movie was more painful than funny i got a couple chuckles and for that it gets one star
Oct 21 2016,positive,very good family movie
Oct 21 2016,negative,it does not do an impressive job of anything youre best to see this when you run out of things on netflix to browse
Oct 20 2016,positive,better than expected a fun ride
Oct 20 2016,positive,really funny had lots of cameo from the older movies hope it becomes a franchise
Oct 20 2016,positive,loved it show us zuul in sequel
Oct 20 2016,positive,it made me laugh good movie as a stand alone but a carbon copy of the first
Oct 20 2016,positive,great reboot honoured the original while making the it their own
Oct 20 2016,positive,excellent and the extended blue ray is even better
Oct 20 2016,negative,why this movie even exists
Oct 20 2016,negative,not the best great actresses but not as great as the original  
Oct 20 2016,negative,rubbish complete and utter garbage
Oct 20 2016,negative,while i can admire that its trying ghostbusters ultimately fails with its terrible script and awkward slapstick
Oct 19 2016,positive,it was funny well cast
Oct 19 2016,positive,a nearperfect reboot of the beloved classic with a funnier allfemale cast ghostbusters is a wonderful gift for all true fans of the franchise it is an expertly crafted film and the creative love shines through in every scene and every riproaring quip to top it all off members of the original cast appear in cameos that underlines the fact that the pinnacle of anything at all really can be achieved if we all work together recommended for everyone who just love a golddarn rootintootin bees knees roller coaster ride of a good movie
Oct 19 2016,neutral,when feig let his talented cast play off of each other it was enjoyable but the majority of this film unfortunately devolved into cliche action and monotonous predictable storytelling
Oct 19 2016,negative,poor script no pizzazz from the characters plenty from the special effects though chris hemsworth was the only gem too damn funny
Oct 19 2016,neutral,it was a good try to remake the ghost busters it wasnt anywhere close to the original   noticed all the guest spots  unfortunately bill murrays part was one of the most stupidest additions  melissa mccarthy really has lost her edge  her character was boring and over acted  the choice of male receptionist was terrible  talk about stupid characters  it didnt make any sense whatsoever  all in all glad i waited for the bargain bin
Oct 19 2016,negative,im a sexist manchildor am i      this is where were at folks  a good snl skit spoofing a bad ghostbusters movie is certified fresh  thankfully a decade from now no one will care and well probably get yet another painful reboot that will manage to somehow be even worse    the perfect metaphors for this movie are in the movie itself  an ugly bloated hateful embodiment of the franchise logo literally gets shot in the privates  and thats what this movie is  a big bloated cynical crotch shot to the audience  but remember youre sexist if you dare not join in on your own punishment but more on that later  the comedy here is the equivalent of subtly making a joke and then someone screaming in your face slapping the crap out of you demanding you laugh and sucking all humor right out of the room  by the way thanks for demonstrating that patty  i might have chuckled quietly maybe twice  its just not funny  this is a movie that literally farts in your face and describes the sound to you  literally  if thats not the perfect set of metaphors to describe this mess i dont know what is        it reminds me of will ferrell movies where the joke lands but then because the crew was laughing the actors keep going just saying random nonsense until someone says cut and by the time the scene ends the joke that was funny at first is now buried beneath an avalanche of useless garbage  just because you laugh on set doesnt mean the joke will work in theaters especially since the audience isnt on the set feeling the wacky energy behind the scenes  but watching the interviews with the director he seems completely unaware of this in spite of his years of fine film making  and it shows    which brings me to another point  the press  it didnt matter whether this movie was good or not the press tour set the film up for failure from the start this movies prerelease press tour was the donald trump campaign of film  pretending to be more than it is while pissing on the intended audience and claiming its raining  by claiming the system was rigged by misogynist fanboys before the movie was even released they could excuse their failure by claiming conspiracy  ill grant you those guys exist but they are a tiny percentage blown out all proportion by a studio doing damage control just to get the movie more free press space  and all they did was give a microphone to the haters and then go and prove them right    this movie is cynicism masquerading as film  it tried its hardest to be something more and then got hamstrung by a studio and a director that had the same sense of purpose and care for the consumer as a slimy used car salesman  this is the rusted out chevy in the corner of the lot that got badly restored by a 1st year c grade mechanics student running on redbull and misguided sponsorships from whoever was stupid enough to think funding the thing would make them hip  and then they claim the consumer did something wrong when it all falls apart  it broke when you drove it  what did you do    i wanted so badly for this movie to work  it doesnt  its broken  effects character building script the painfully forced cameos except ernie hudson his was ok the adam sandler level product placementsit justdoesntwork  moments that could have been amazing like the final battle are dragged into an eye rolling comedy wasteland through the actors mugging and spewing terrible forgettable oneliners right after  you want to cheer but you just feel insulted  there is no excusing or fixing this wreck  crush it and sell it for scrap    id almost feel bad trashing this movie if sony wasnt involved but look at their track record  this is the company that keeps flooding the market with sandler films  the company that made the amazing spiderflop screw you rami and the amazing spiderflop 2 the desperation continues  theyre making an emoji movie for goodness sake  pixels  i cant feel bad for this movie or anyone involved because they knew what companies were involved and they knew what that meant    sony get out of the film industry entirely shut down your distribution division and go back to being a purely electronics manufacturing based company  youre a goldfish trying to climb a tree  get back in your pond    and finally about that youre a sexist manchild if you dont like it stuff    i think the most damning review of this movie for me at least comes from my wife  she liked the original but didnt grow up with it so shes not a knuckle dragging 80s fan living in the past  she has good taste in movies and a great sense of humor  she didnt care about the controversy the press or the gender of the cast  she just wanted a good movie  she is in short the perfect objective audience member for this particular film  and shes a smart funny modern womanyou know the supposed core of the cheering section for this movie    and her exact sarcastic words were thank you ever so much for making we waste two hours of my life
Oct 19 2016,negative,this movie was trash
Oct 19 2016,negative,this movie was just awful i wanted to like it  the story was bad the jokes were flat and the ghost look liked cartoons
Oct 19 2016,negative,the original was bad and this was worse
Oct 19 2016,negative,the first 10 minutes draw you in with the initial fright scene but after that the plot is completely forgettable much of the cast seemed to clash instead of gel and the characters could have been played by anyone none of the actors seemed to stamp a mark on their roles except kate mckinnon i prayed for much of the film that chris hemsworths character wasnt going to pop up in a scene the whole film seemed to miss a trick and felt more like one of those dire scooby doo films than a reboot of a classic film shame
Oct 19 2016,neutral,much less spooky and fun than the original this ghostbusters seems like an snl spoof skit more than anything
Oct 18 2016,negative,i laughed more often than i expected but that doesnt help this mediocre film with its forgettable villain forgettable plot dumb supporting characters and worthless cameos  everyone in this film is trying to be the funniest person in the room and it doesnt work at all
Oct 18 2016,negative,they shouldnt have bothered with this
Oct 18 2016,neutral,im glad that i didnt pay to see this movie
Oct 18 2016,negative,this is a perfect example of a company keeping the rights to a franchise now it had some good comedians yet they had no chemistry as i read the other reviews its apparent that anyone who didnt like this movie is sexist well actually this movie has a polished turd if you honestly gave this anything higher than 3 stars stop reviewing movies this is a redbox at best
Oct 18 2016,positive,ghostbusters  the remake nobody asked for  is actually worth seeing  the leads really make it worth it  as a worthy followup to the original series  not even close  cant help but wonder what this could have been like if it was truly original  as is its really a flashy remake of the original that follows the plot a little too closely  wait to stream it then enjoy it more than you thought you would
Oct 18 2016,positive,i think ghostbusters may need a resuscitation all this movie needed was kate mckinnon and leslie jones to kick ghost ass sadly mccarthy and wiig could have sat this one out
Oct 18 2016,negative,ghostbusters boasts a very talented cast of actors with some jokes that work but shades away with the recapturing of the 1984 classic ghostbusters
Oct 18 2016,negative,this movie has humor energy and direction that lasts as long as bill murrays fiveminute cameo a pointless and seemingly endless waste of time
Oct 18 2016,negative,there was absolutely no reason to make this movie and that can be felt throughout the entire film poorly acted badly written and horrible directed with cheap specal effects
Oct 18 2016,negative,one notch above embarrassment
Oct 18 2016,positive,b funny in parts but really seems manufactured on an assembly line
Oct 18 2016,negative,so i watched this actually on release and i wont lie i completely went in there thinking it was going to be bad and i wasnt too wrong it wasnt as bad as i thought it would be but it was really just a pure thick slice of feminist propaganda that really didnt do anything good for the franchise or the fans of the original film    the purpose for the all female cast seemed to be ah yes because it was all men before so it must of been sexist so let us make this one all women and then not give a single positive male character what so ever we get a himbo who plugs his eyes when he hears loud noises and gets a sandwich when the apocalypse is on going and he is purely used as a sex object but that is bad and they make it aware that you shouldnt do it but it is still perfectly fine    the other male character a nerdy shut in who hates women because hes a strange nerd who never left his mothers basement or a representation shall we say of the stereotypical male internet user who literally spouts nothing but misogynistic comments and is in charge of a dance number that feels like it belongs to the scooby doo movies and all those awful 90s all inclusive films    the ghost busters themselves werent that ammusing not exactly bad but i mean really it isnt their fault their lines and script were bloody terrible to begin with oh and for those saying the new script has nothing to do with the old films sorry its a mash of both films ley lines that summon a vortex of ghosts and daemons from the underworld and the bad guy becomes the form of their chosen destroyer so we have the plot of the 2nd movie with the ending of the first my word so original there are so many things that could of saved this film but it failed hard to do anything for a fan of the original should of just done ghost busters extreme instead would of been much better and more relevant
Oct 18 2016,positive,i really dont get the hate the cast was alright the movie was mediocre and there were moments where i genuinely laughed out loud i cant diss it and say its bad and i cant say its perfect either compare it to the original and you will have a hard time on its own its great though
Oct 18 2016,positive,entertaining but lacking the fun of the original  the actresses are generally strong although wigg seems to be deadset on being serious and not funny but the plot ultimately doesnt have as much fun with the premise as it could  it takes too long to establish the origins of the ghostbusters and ignores the original movie  since the women do not play female versions of the original cast but rather new people busting ghosts it leaves one to wonder if the two movies even exist in the same universe  while there are some fun cameos i personally would have enjoyed a cleaner connection between the original ghostbusters and this new chapter
Oct 18 2016,positive,love it  average funny relatable women in an extraordinary situation who become heros and still remain true to who they are without being arrogant it was a fun movie with great special effects cant wait for my friends and me to imitate these women for halloween it was a nice touch that the original cast had cameo appearances in this movie  nice touch this movie stood on its own and was not in competition for the original ghostbusters movie which is a classic
Oct 18 2016,negative,holy terrible movie i didnt expect greatness but this movie was awful bad acting bad casting below par effects bad make up work  utter lack of storyline or originality in any way it felt more like a cheap half hearted rip off of the original concept of the ghostbusters films not at all a homage to them  my vote is skip itwatch the originals theyre still fantastic even today
Oct 18 2016,positive,i thought this movie was very funny the jokes worked well  and it was full of little side comments and quick quips the movie ended with some poor effects  it felt like they ran out of money  i thought there was a bit of cheesiness to the effects through the movie but it felt like homage to the original
Oct 18 2016,positive,good remake funny but needed more melissa mccarthy
Oct 18 2016,positive,loved this movie smart funny with the occasional nod back to the original classic maybe not as great as the original but a solid enjoyable movie who doesnt love a kick ass chick packing a proton pack
Oct 17 2016,positive,perfectly watchable fun movie doesnt deserve half the flak its been getting and yes i saw and enjoyed the originals
Oct 17 2016,positive,as long as you dont go into this movie with any expectations its okay just a silly movie for the sake of a silly movie
Oct 17 2016,negative,while i really wanted to like this movie i just couldnt great cast and visual effects however it reeked of desperation and just trying too hard it was like a great steak that somebody overcooked with better guidance and vision it could have been an epic film so sad it could have been so good
Oct 17 2016,negative,i went into this movie open minded and wanted it to be good with that being said it was watchable but forgettable leslie jones and kate mckinnon were definitely the comedic saviours of the film kristen wiig was ok as the lead and melissa mccarthy was annoyingly out of her element i must say that chris hemsworth was slightly entertaining but on the whole it was a little much the story and the villian rowan was weak and just plain old lame the jonesmckinnon comedy the special effects and waiting to see the cameos was the only thing that kept me interested in the film    ps  the music sucked 
Oct 17 2016,positive,really good movie lots of a tion and comedy hope thery make a ghost busters 2 soon
Oct 17 2016,negative,puerile rubbish i will never get the 30 mins i watched it for back
Oct 17 2016,negative,tried to hard to make a funny ghostbusters movie failed horribly
Oct 17 2016,negative,disappointingly nonfunny in what could have been a good movie had the comedy been on par with its original instead of trashhumor
Oct 17 2016,positive,not bad a lot better than expected and really really better than the flop it was hyped to be the plot wasnt annoying albeit predictable not particularly funny and filled with gender reversal jokes i enjoyed all the cameos especially dan aykroyd they get a free pass for using the nostalgia card because it was done quite elegantly   its not ghostbusters its a ghostbusters tribute band that tries a bit too much but youd definitely pay to see them perform  feminism was crudely forced into this movie sometimes implying stereotypes and other times just blatantly using them to move the plot chris hemsworths role for most of the movie was that of a superficial secretary in an 80s movie while a big element of the protagonists is how society treats them not being able to afford the fire station shamed in the public eye and being the weird ghost girls personally i think there was room for more creative retelling of the story than a plain feminist twist  the movie left me wondering what the antagonists motives were why and how he wanted to bring chaos to the world besides him just being an undermined mad scientist moonlighting as a janitor the actor was also a little undermined as the writers kept the best lines for his evil spirit and whoever it possessed  overall it wasnt the best movie of the year but it wasnt an insult to the original either and didnt deserve all the bad cred it definitely needed less gender jokes and a better defined baddie or no baddie at all
Oct 17 2016,positive,funny and good movie but will never replace the original
Oct 17 2016,positive,really thought this was pretty good i went into it thinking it was going to stink but surprise i enjoyed it
Oct 17 2016,positive,it was an ok movie not the best but i def seen worse
Oct 17 2016,positive,a very good movie the girls have excellent chemistry and nothing seems forced lots of laughs and action nice reboot to the franchise now if people just gave it a chance
Oct 17 2016,positive,great movie it was fun and hilarious from start to finish its great to see women in roles that are usually reserved for men and vice versa young girls need more heroines on the big screen  its great to see normal looking people doing great things and not super model looking chicks with their breasts out
Oct 17 2016,positive,please ignore the barelyliterate mens rights advocate posts this film was fun and hilarious and a worthy successor to the original
Oct 17 2016,negative,i felt bad for the talented actresses plus hemsworth whos excellent in a comical role who tried their best but the jokes were so badly written and the scenes so badly directed that i couldnt wait for this movie to finish i put the blame for this disaster squarely on paul feig
Oct 17 2016,negative,big disappointed it was too long unfunny stupid and really boring original was really funny and fantastic but remake was like tvs snl sketches i was really tired to see so many dumb crazy and boring conversations if you loved 1984 original maybe you shouldnt watch it
Oct 16 2016,positive,this shit is so fire its a must watch
Oct 16 2016,negative,leslie jones is goodthats about it
Oct 16 2016,positive,one of feigs lesser movies and nowhere near the quality of the original but its still fun and is not the trainwreck some are claiming it to be  great 3d felt like a live action version of the cartoon actually
Oct 16 2016,positive,despite all the negativity behind it this movie was actually very enjoyable and i truly liked it definitely a must watch
Oct 16 2016,positive,i thought it was a fine adaptation of the ghostbusters franchise it has clever writing and made me laugh
Oct 16 2016,negative,nonsensical rented it at home and couldnt even see past half too many grotesque and pointless jokes
Oct 16 2016,positive,fantastic flic i didnt have high expectations based on the lack of imagination in a lot of recent attempts to mine nostalgia but this movie was thoroughly enjoyable the whole film was chocked full of really clever genuinely funny moments it absolutely nailed the whole franchises vibe     dont let the misogynistic internet sperglords tell you otherwisei highly doubt most of the negative reviews have even seen the movie
Oct 16 2016,negative,the big scene in the original was stay puffed walking through the streets and the statue of liberty walking to jackie wilsons your love lifts me nothing in this new version compared to that sadly disappointing
Oct 16 2016,negative,bbbborrrring so borrrrrrring so incredibly boring
Oct 16 2016,positive,underrated movie was completely surprised a must see
Oct 16 2016,positive,a nice mix up of a classic film the ladies have made a tired horse young again   no doubt the original is still the best but this is a fun new twist
Oct 16 2016,negative,while the final movie is not as bad as the terrible trailers made it look the final movie is certainly a predictable misfire made for all the wrong reasons  many of the jokes are painfully unfunny  mostly it relies on nostalgia for its mass appeal but seems to understand very little of the original movies wit or charm
Oct 16 2016,positive,lvelaughed the entire time fantastic job of a remake without copying the original loved the cameos from the actors of the original series too
Oct 16 2016,positive,ghostbusters answer the call 2016 has absolutely nothing to do with the 1984 hit  this version stars four women in the the leads roles melissa mccarthy as dr abby yates kristen wiig as dr erin gilbert kate mckinnon as dr jillian holtzmann and leslie jones as patty toan  most of the original cast pop up in minor cameos but this isnt a sequel or spin off     the original theme song is utilized and both slimer and the stay puff marshmallow man make appearances theres a new version of their car echo1 and a bunch of updated ghostbusting toys and some minor allusions to the original movie     this movie however has a very different plot an occultist rowan north neil casey  has been using mechanical devices to summon ghost across various points on two ley lines in manhattan with the desired goal of opening a giant portal at its intersecting point bringing about armageddon  after the ghostbusters discover his natharius plot they set out to save the city      knowing  that this film has nothing to do with the original is important  you need to look at this movie as its own thing  dont compare it     on its own this movie clocking in at 116 minutes is a silly stupid action comedy starring four comic geniuses  youll need to seriously suspend disbelief but there are laughs and even a couple of good belly laughs is it as good as the original  nah   but its good for what it is a silly light hearted action comedy that will allow you to forget about life for two hours     in the end its a pointless fun lazy afternoon movie dont over think it just enjoy the ride
Oct 16 2016,positive,super funny the girls from snl did not disappoint  my kids loved it too and keep asking to watch it on trips  true laugh out loud
Oct 16 2016,negative,painfully unfunny and a waste of my time and money
Oct 16 2016,negative,the entire movie was like a bad snl skit truly disappointed  its amazing how the original ghostbusters had better graphics than this one  skip it
Oct 16 2016,negative,not funny at all and the only reason it was made is to try and make men look like a bunch of blubbering idiots while the women are superior in every way they failed in that aspect doesnt respect the source material in the slightest this movie was made so feminists could feel better about themselves and if anybody does feel good about themselves after watching this mess i highly recommend checking yourself into a psychiatric hospital
Oct 16 2016,negative,finally saw thisand i wanted to give the benefit of the doubt and saw the extended version   goodness  i dont know where to start  ultimately all 4 actresses are excellent for the roles however the script is absolutely awful so all the jokes fell very flat  the writing needs to be much wittier and fast paced    hemsworth is completely useless and fails to even live up to his own characters stupidity  special effects are cartoonish  that worked in the 80s not today    some areas i thought were temporarily successful the government already knowing about the ghosts yet telling the public its false  also kate mckinnon steals the performances for me which is ironic that shes the least known name   other than that i was expecting a bit more from the film  this was a huge chance for them to do something that can stand on its own and i was really pulling for an all female ghostbusters  what people are not thinking about the extremely easy way to franchise ghostbusters  all guys all girls la ny all black all hispanic all etc there are tons of ways to play this out  but this falls completely and utterly flat
Oct 16 2016,neutral,farcical hardly draws a laugh passable entertainment
Oct 16 2016,positive,actually much funnier than the first
Oct 16 2016,positive,this is a very good movie watch it
Oct 16 2016,positive,hilarious they did an awesome job i havent laughed so hard in a movie in a long time
Oct 16 2016,positive,despite the negative reviews ive so far watched this film three times loved the characters especially holtzmann and patty supporting cast was great and it felt both like a fresh story and a loving homage to the originals loved the cast cameos and little references throughout  didnt feel like fanservice or overkill a funny entertaining film that i thoroughly enjoyed
Oct 16 2016,negative,boooorrrring and i really want this to be good kirsten wig  melissa mccarthy was ok but nowhere as good as bridesmaids  the other 2 were forgettable im a big hemsworth fan and even that was ok just revisit the original not the sequel and go no further
Oct 16 2016,negative,not even a little funny
Oct 16 2016,positive,puts a refreshing modern twist to the classic complete with outstanding performances and great direction
Oct 15 2016,negative,you have to be on drugs to watch and enjoy this falls far short of the original humor of the gb franchise please stop making such crap the script is of such poor quality not sure what drugs the writers were on come on with the gender reversals just write a goddamn good story regardless of making a gender point
Oct 15 2016,positive,relax all you nerd losers who are giving this movie a bad rating  youre not going to recapture your childhood watching this  im not even sure the original ghostbusters were good movies  i dont remember them that much  just that they were a big deal  this movie was funny and the action was pretty entertaining  it falls off the rails in the end but otherwise its a thumbs up
Oct 15 2016,positive,if people didnt have such high expectations for this movie as part of the ghostbusters franchise and they just looked at the story itself then it would have ranked very high on this years movie lists  i saw ghostbusters when i was very young and i went in costume to see ghostbusters 2 in theaters i took my daughter to see this new ghostbusters and it did not disappoint
Oct 15 2016,negative,i really wanted to like this movie its just a mess
Oct 15 2016,positive,laughed a lot nuff said
Oct 15 2016,positive,on arrival in the new world a young irish emigre has much to look forward to despite the heartache of leaving home she gets a job and after a whirlwind romance a husband however the death of her older sister soon thereafter prompts a return to ireland where she finds her job and marriage prospects fortunes have markedly improved but how does she drop the bombshell a simply told period piece with splendid acting and engaging characters
Oct 15 2016,positive,this female all star cast made this movie just an entertaining ad the originals 8 was laughing at all the historical action and popculture reference integration makes this an easy competitor for the other guys
Oct 15 2016,positive,much better than expected still not as good as the original however worth watching at least
Oct 15 2016,negative,movie sucked almost walked out
Oct 15 2016,negative,absolutely garbage nothing to do with who is in it or rebooting a franchise just objectively an insanely terrible boring and bad unfunny unwatchable film
Oct 15 2016,negative,i can see why this movie bombed they can try to blame it on sexism against woman all they want but it had nothing to do with it  first the acting was horrible the writing was horrendous the special effects were mediocre at best the one liners and comedy was just terrible how all these critics gave this movie a good rating is beyond me
Oct 15 2016,negative,the feminists took a weekend off of neutering americas males to turn attention to hollywood making the 1st of many planed female only films the only thing wrong is everything about this farce is everything is wrong  save your evening watch something else
Oct 15 2016,positive,this movie is funny and awesome its great to see a movie i loved as a kid rebooted and given a modern take
Oct 15 2016,negative,i dont get it  i wanted to  i really wanted to  spoilers below    im one of the few people that honestly didnt care that they reversed genders  and i really wanted to see why the huge upset from every  person that i know that even remembers the originals  i thought i would enjoy it     i really wanted to like it    there are a few funny moments but i can count them but i didnt need it to be funny  i wanted there to be a solid story  and while i did not mind the overtly strong girl power message it kept hammering home ill never get why the need to put such strong women around literally the dumbest group of males ever born      why is there such a need to bash men to elevate women  from the nut cracker comments to kevin the office person really not saying anything intelligent to the bad guys plan because he was bullied to where they aimed at the last ghost i am depressed that this movie spent more time focused on male bashing jokes over and over than just making a good movie  annie potts the office person from the original was never a dumb character  sigourney weavers character was never a dumb character  why did there come this desire to do that here    this movie had an agenda and i honestly never pay attention to this kind of stuff  im all for women  im all for strong female leads to show our future generations of growing girls that yes you can be whatever you want to be but why stomp on men with constant man jokes on what could have been such a good movie    i love all the actresses and even the actors  it had some funny moments but it didnt really feel like a ghostbusters movie  it felt like someone wanted to drive home just how much women are better than men  and maybe its true who the hell am i to argue that but why not make a fun movie about a team of people busting ghosts      and maybe you will tell me that i spent too much time focused on gender but i mean it you are force fed it the entire movie    how this got a fresh score is nothing but confusing for me  i bought this film brought it home genuinely thinking that i was going to have a fun night  and i got a movie where i was told that being a man is bad  and i really just wanted to be told that there are some kick ass women that know how to bust ghosts    the special effects were great but over used  the bullied bad guy plot just didnt go anywhere  kate knocked it out of the park  leslie knocked it out of the park  melissa and kristen should have been the show stoppers but werent    this was a mess when it really shouldnt have been  and adding all the old actorsactresses was maybe some of the worst ideas that they came up with  all they did was remind you why you liked the original to this pile    nothing but love to all the actresses and actors  nothing but love to the special effects team  the writersdirector this is all your fault  driving divides in gender and calling it equality is just  baffling  you dont need to put down a group to elevate another      and i really wanted to love it  i tried to love it  but its just really bad 
Oct 15 2016,positive,i feel like we should stop comparing this movie to the original and just look at it as a solo film the movies not that bad its actually pretty funny and creative
Oct 15 2016,positive,i think we were mislead into thinking this was a remake of course there are portions that take from the original and this will never be as great as that was for so many reasons but this couldve stood on its own two feet just fine if marketed correctly     the girls brought a humor and energy to the story that welcomed in a new era of ghostbusters the best part chris hemsworth that man has so much untapped comedic talent i cant believe weve not seen it before positively the best part of this entire film
Oct 15 2016,neutral,this is the best nickelodeon film ever made
Oct 15 2016,negative,damn  this movie is just money grabbing at best
Oct 15 2016,positive,it was a good and funny movie but theres still something that stops me from giving this movie 5 stars the soundtrack is good tho
Oct 15 2016,neutral,remember the original then this is it without the class of the originality 
Oct 15 2016,positive,great moviebrought me back to my childhoodloved the sentimental similarities to the originalworth watching
Oct 15 2016,negative,this movie is pure garbage nothing but an unabashed moneygrab not one redeeming quality on offer here wish i could unsee this one
Oct 15 2016,positive,the original was better
Oct 15 2016,positive,i would take some of the 1 star audience reviews with a grain of start a bunch of guys decided before the trailer even came out that they were going to try to fail this movie by downvoting it and many are still doing it without even watching the film  it was very good and i am in love with jillian holtzman bless
Oct 15 2016,negative,its amazing how blown out of proportion this movie is from any angle when really all that matters in the end is that its not humorous
Oct 15 2016,negative,i can guarantee quite a few of the critics who rated this movie fresh are scared of being branded sexist horrid movie with bland crappy acting although chris hemsworth was okay the rest was shit shiiiiiiiit
Oct 15 2016,positive,a funny rehash of that classic ghostcomedy
Oct 15 2016,negative,i cant decide what was worse the acting or the writing it is a shame because the base idea was good and when it first started i thought it wouldnt be so bad ive seen better acting in movies that were funded with credit cards i feel bad for kristen wiig and leslie jones for having their names on these credits hopefully someone owes you a favor now and you can get into a good movie
Oct 15 2016,negative,personally didnt  like it
Oct 14 2016,positive,the ladies have good chemistry with each other
Oct 14 2016,negative,not that funny  and way too pc for my taste  they should have kept the movie as close to the original as possible
Oct 14 2016,negative,if you were born after the 1980s and never seen the original than this movie might be ok for you  but if you lived through the original movie hipe and releasewell this version really socks  doesnt come close to the feeling and experience of the original ghost busters  its like if someone tried to do a star wars knock off with a girl darth vader and a guy princess leihadoesnt work  hollywood  hintquit trying to remake masterpieces even if you couch them as a sequels or something of that matter how about some originality
Oct 14 2016,negative,now that ive seen it i can say it wasnt misogyny that killed this movie at the box office  it was it being an unfunny bore that did it in its stunning in its terribleness but not in an interesting way something strange indeed
Oct 14 2016,negative,i went into this movie before knowing the history of the making of this movie or any of the other garbage plain fact i dont get it why does it feel like the underwear was pulled out of my pants and slipped over my head in simpsons fashion why do you hate me film  i didnt want to hate you    the story and pacing was lack luster and unoriginal the jokes  maybe the humor was not geared towards me because i didnt laugh once    after reading the history of the film its almost like the producers did this on purpose  turned it into an in your face film    there is nothing deep or philosophical in this film no lessons to be learned it is just an in your face shameless rebuttal to all the people who slagged the film while it was being made thats the simple truth
Oct 14 2016,negative,poor attempt at slapstick forced punchlines one dimensional and uninteresting characters and to say that the movie leaves more to be desired brands one a misogynist by the community that tries to defend a poor movie
Oct 14 2016,negative,the following quotes were my own reactions after renting ghostbusters 2016     trying to watch but already annoyed by the opening scene     why does this whole film look like its using an instagram filter which one is it juno mayfair ugh     did the person who made the goosebumps tv series make this mess great now im yelling at the screen     i just exclaimed aye yai yai while pounding my forehead like when i have an ice cream headache     im watching through my fingers like its scary its helping keep the tourettes at bay     i just realized im reacting to this atrocity in the same way as when im forced to watch zip popping videos     oh my god were only halfway through     i need an aspirin and a paper bag     trump speeches are better written than this thing     its been like a night of painful diarrhea i mightve actually preferred that come to think of it     i feel like ive betrayed harold ramiss memory by watching this i hope hes haunting whoever is responsible     holy crap this is the swedish fish oreos of movies     there are still 25 minutes left why the hell did i rent the extended version     im so glad im not suicidal this wouldve pushed me over the edge just so i could apologize to harold ramis in person     climax how did they manage to make the special effects even more annoyingly awful     that which doesnt kill me makes me stronger that which doesnt kill me makes me stronger that which doesnt kill me makes me stronger that which doesnt kill me makes me stronger that which doesnt kill me makes me stronger that which doesnt kill me makes me stronger that which doesnt kill me makes me stronger     thinking of watching this good luck id rather go through childbirth again     painful diarrhea trump speeches childbirth swedish fish oreos all things id rather endure than sit through this thing     credits rolling and so is the sweat all over me     life is meaningless     the gift that keeps on giving i now have a spasm in my back from the violent cringing it caused me     im giving this a 12 star but if i could vote in more appropriate symbols id give it 5 barf emojis honestly its as if they took all the cutting room floor footage and strung it together into a loud wordsalad mess
Oct 14 2016,positive,i dont  understand all the hate about this one an entertaining and really funny film which reinvents the franchise ignore the obvious sexist casting and symbolism and youre good
Oct 14 2016,positive,way funnier than the original ghostbusters
Oct 14 2016,positive,really better than i expected
Oct 14 2016,positive,kate mckinnons character is too over the top and some of the jokes dont land but apart from that this movie is entertaining and enjoyable to watch
Oct 14 2016,positive,it was ok kristin wigg is consistently funny until the end where she barely says a thing as she partakes in a very clichãd series of endgame action sequences its very awkward to see these snl actresses try to be big screen stars though kate mckinnon especially has no place there
Oct 14 2016,neutral,yeah i knew going in this probably wasnt going to be great id say 30 is funny 70 not but thats how i feel about what passes for comedy in films of the past 1015 years dreck stupid stupid humor the script is poor and the story almost would have been decent if it had better writers behind it and wasnt trying so hard to be like the original the cameos were kind of wasted too but i did think the ghosts were pretty cool
Oct 14 2016,negative,most sexist piece of bullshit garbage ive ever seen
Oct 13 2016,positive,better than the original scarier funnier and more authentic with very impressive storytelling
Oct 13 2016,positive,loved it very funny love the little pop ups from oringal cast great graphics
Oct 13 2016,positive,this whole idea was unoriginal and boring come up with your own idea for a movie no one wants to see ugly bull dykes trying to act like badasses
Oct 13 2016,negative,while this film was fun for some i felt it just didnt live up to the style that the original two movies portrayed this film was downright childish and i couldnt help but feel like i walked in hoping to watch an instant classic like scream and ended up getting scary movie parody instead too many of the effects look poorly rendered and incomplete for an actual film they reminded me of a video game cgi scene not enough care was taken with the script to give this franchise the facelift it deserved making this reboot a joke
Oct 13 2016,positive,was pretty funny i liked it
Oct 13 2016,positive,thought it was wonderful
Oct 13 2016,negative,one star for zero production values and horrible direction  this raises to three stars because ghostbusters actually works as an exploitation film  back down to two stars because i expect more from the franchise
Oct 13 2016,negative,a few clever jokes and two great performances hemsworth and mckinnon cant save this subpar reboot
Oct 13 2016,negative,the original is better
Oct 13 2016,positive,not as good as original sure but still funny  entertaining
Oct 13 2016,negative,it would have been better if the girls were daughters of the original  ghostbusters
Oct 13 2016,negative,this an abortion of a film  the best comparison is the 1966 batman minus the cohesive plot structure and relevant jokes  if you like the originals and are interested in this do yourself a favor and watch the old ones again
Oct 12 2016,negative,the opening was ok everything else was just awkward
Oct 12 2016,positive,go girl power anyone who doesnt see this film is a mysoginist
Oct 12 2016,negative,i desperately hoped i would love this movie having argued before it came out with all those obnoxious haters i really had hoped to walk away totally satisfied i did not it was rarely funny though the few moments had me laughing pretty hard and it completely lacked the kind of magic strength of plot  and character chemistry of the original really disappointed and craving a rewatch of the original now more than anything
Oct 12 2016,positive,i will admit for a movie thats suposed to be so bad i really enjoyed this i mean i smiled laughed had a really good time here cant say theres any real reason to skip this movie aside from mabey its just not for u but i for one loved this and cant wait to see it agin melisia mccarthy is a blast as is everyone eles involved complete gotta see
Oct 12 2016,negative,awful unfunny movie not even a laugh
Oct 12 2016,negative,this movie is a freaking disgrace for the original ghostbusters movie i am very disappointed
Oct 12 2016,negative,was a poor rendition of a beloved classic not even the cameos could help this movie i give it a big thumbs down
Oct 12 2016,positive,fun and definitely worth to see
Oct 12 2016,positive,first half quite funny and original second half with the portal and big bad guy very cliche
Oct 12 2016,positive,this movie is very entertaining and amusing i still prefer the original always have and always will
Oct 12 2016,neutral,not as bad as you would think   nice nostalgic moments great visual scenes at the end
Oct 12 2016,negative,not even comparing it to the original its just a terrible movie the special effects were cartoony i dont feel like leslie jones was funny the whole cast didnt seem to have that buddy buddy relationship we expect from comedies constructed like ghostbusters and chris hemsworths characterwhat was that what was the point of the incredibly stupid receptionist     comparing it to the originalswhich you cantit fails on all levels
Oct 12 2016,positive,one of the best remakes ive ever seen it was fantastic seeing the ghosts and streams going outside the widescreen boxes super fun and really smart jokes my score might go up with multiple viewings
Oct 11 2016,positive,best of 80s exuberance rocking music and grownup wit snl might as well have cast the show these actors must have had a blast making the film
Oct 11 2016,positive,yea i cant even compare to the original but if you look at it as a completely different series ghostbusters is actually pretty fun i enjoyed the female turn as the entire cast is well casted feig creates plenty of fun laughs and the updated special effects are used effectively would not mind seeing a sequel
Oct 11 2016,neutral,well done on the story could have been better if erin wasnt shallow
Oct 11 2016,positive,this movie was outstanding it didnt do well with male audiences because theyre whiny crybabies that insist that the world continue to revolve around them well guys you already have two ghostbusters movies so no need to cry these brand new characters stand well on their own while still doing justice to the original series easily my favorite movie of 2016 i normally wont watch movies with kristen wiig because i find her annoying but she was great in this movie but the two breakout characters were played by kate mckinnon and leslie jones they stole every scene they were in and made already great movie even better i wouldnt change a single thing about this movie a fun watch  and if youve already decided that you wont like it because its not the original or because its an all female cast dont waste your time and let the rest of us enjoy this masterpiece of the cinema
Oct 11 2016,positive,great movie i really enjoyed it actually i liked it better than the original
Oct 11 2016,negative,the post credit sequence is funnier than the entire preceding movie zach woods and janine melnitz cameos were the only two characters that didnt try way too hard or completely phone it in
Oct 11 2016,negative,insult to the original total rip off of story line except worse not funny and it just kinda makes you angry the entire time watching acting was terrible and they tried so hard to be funny in fact this has  gotta be one of the worst films ive ever seen  very creative guys hey lets reverse  the old genders of the previous movies and try to steal the story line first two movies 4 guys and a girl secretary new movie 4 girls and a male secretary if i could rate this a minus 1 i would paul feig should be embarrassed with this garbage take some pride in your work man
Oct 11 2016,negative,about half as good as one of the ghostbusters tv episodes and twice as offensively feminist as the original was offensively chauvenist
Oct 11 2016,negative,terrible movie and still would have been with men in the lead roles
Oct 11 2016,negative,how about back to the future meets the ghostbusters
Oct 11 2016,positive,funny movie and a great chick flick
Oct 10 2016,neutral,its not awful but it aint good neither i wanted to love this movie but just couldnt ghostbusters lacks of charisma and wastes its talented cast and director
Oct 10 2016,negative,boring and not funny one star for special effects
Oct 10 2016,positive,really funny and made even better by the multiple cameos at the beginning of the movie i really thought kate mckinnons character was going to shine with quirky humor but sadly this falls flat for most of the movie
Oct 10 2016,positive,loved it  so much fun
Oct 10 2016,positive,very entertaining movie with lots of action comedy  and a good story line
Oct 10 2016,neutral,kind of boring yet another example of unoriginal hollywood attempting to capitalize on decades old successful movies because of the lack of creativity
Oct 10 2016,negative,horrible dont watch it
Oct 10 2016,positive,apart from holtz stupid jokes it was good wished they integrated the legacy though
Oct 10 2016,positive,great humor acting and satire is what makes this supernatural comedy a great film
Oct 10 2016,positive,love it and laughed my butt off the extended version was much better
Oct 10 2016,positive,underated refreshing to see strong female leads easily better than all the transformers flicks combined
Oct 9 2016,positive,this movie just worked for me on all levels the original is one of my favorite movies ever and while i expected to be severely disappointed with this one turns out to have been a blast
Oct 9 2016,negative,close to the worst movie ive ever seen i was disappointed by the arguing online regarding this film and was looking forward to seeing it now i completely agree with all the negative reviews this movie is a joke
Oct 9 2016,negative,this movie was terrible i was so disappointed having loved the original and being a huge melissa mccarthy fan i had high hopes for this movie  part of the fun of the original was the fact that the ghostbusters had noclue what they were doing  this was a ridiculous movie the jokes fell flat the story was boring and it was obvious that the writers were more concerned with making them look like badass women than they were with with actually writing and directing a good movie for the amazing talent they had  such a waste
Oct 9 2016,negative,yuck went into this movie open minded but it was bad like i fell asleep dead asleep bad cant say i laughed at all kate and leslie were good but the script was terrible im not comparing it to the original that would be unfair comparing it to anything and it is still just a really bad movie i wonder if they gave the critics a different movie for them to score it so high im glad that im no longer watching it
Oct 9 2016,positive,good movie   light hearted  i actually liked the women and chris hemsworth more      then again i am not really a fan of the original movie
Oct 9 2016,positive,this was an interesting and funny movie each second of the movie was enjoyable the only problem was that the animations were a bit off the scale but anyway it was awesome
Oct 9 2016,negative,i could only watch the first 15 minutes its so artificial
Oct 9 2016,positive,great cast the chemistry they have is amazing and it really shows on screen
Oct 9 2016,positive,this movie was great i loved the original and i love this one
Oct 9 2016,positive,great action and good actors but the plot was a little rough problemsolutionproblem solution but over all a funny scary good quality film
Oct 8 2016,negative,big ghost busters but i will pass on this agenda filled movie
Oct 8 2016,positive,love the cast execution is not without merit could have been more funny given the fabulous cast a little bit disappointed but in the same time im really surprised by the movie was expecting a train wreck it was decent
Oct 8 2016,positive,love the cast they are awesome
Oct 7 2016,negative,a disappointing dim shadow to the original when i watched it with my kids its was appalling to see how much bad language profanity and vulgarity replaced humor and overall great story we enjoyed in the original ghostbusters imildly entertaining but youre not missing much if you miss this movie
Oct 7 2016,negative,another hollywood film that panders to mindless idiots that want their entertainment fed to them well chewed and thoroughly blended as to not waste any brain power chewing  with bright lights loud noises neon ghosts and tasteless joke after joke it will be sure to keep the most brain dead american entertained  even terri schiavo would label this film garbage
Oct 6 2016,positive,so all in all i came around a bit surprised by the movie  the movie isnt perfect for sure and isnt as good as the original movie but i did find myself laughing quite a bit from the movie  does every joke land  no they dont especially in the third act but i think this movie has far more laughs then misses  the story could have used some polishing and the fan service needed to be cut out but i loved these four women together  the movie achieves something that i wasnt expecting  when watching this movie i was watching it as its own thing and not really thinking about the original film   i thought i would hate it and instead thought it was a pretty solid movie  the biggest mistake sony made when making ghostbusters is spending close to almost 144 million dollars and to have visual effects look so subpar but again i came away having had a good time and did not get the worst movie i was expecting to get    full review  
Oct 6 2016,negative,it stereotypes everyone it has bad cgi  its just for little kids  not  the real ghostbusters fans 
Oct 6 2016,negative,kate mckinnon is awesome  chris hemsworth plays an unexpected role   and maybe thats the only nice things i can say about this movie  the cameos from the ogs i dont know why they supported it   ill give it a 210
Oct 6 2016,positive,loved it not sure why people are hating on it watched at the theaters bought the movie and watch it often in our vudu account
Oct 5 2016,positive,i dont understand all the hate the movie while not amazing was at least very entertaining i enjoyed it much more than i thought i would and it kept my attention all the way to the end i think this film is getting more crap than it deserves just because its a female cast
Oct 5 2016,positive,another example of negative publicity being used in a positive way all those poor marketing campaign products all added up to an almost 2 hour journey of absolute fun and enjoyable jokes all backed up with a pretty solid story
Oct 5 2016,positive,really hilarious and great effects
Oct 4 2016,negative,i am a fan of the original i am male i am a geek this movie hates me overtly and hammered me in the face with that fact over and over again for its 90 minutes     i could be fine with that i suppose if the movie was otherwise entertaining or thought provoking but that simply is not the case the pacing is all over the place like the movie couldnt decide if it wanted to copy the beats of the original or do its own thing the characters are flat or at best caricatures the villain had a motivation of nothing more than i will destroy the world for saying mean things the effects were cheesy not cheesy good like the original but cheesy like scoobydo meets disneys hanuted mansion it wasnt a comedy it wasnt a horror it wasnt a combination or even a parodyit was just a confused mess    im not antireboot either there have been some pretty terrific reboot efforts dredd and ash vs evil dead come to mind and the first star trek was pretty excellent so i like to think i am giving this film a fair shake despite the nostalgia for the original    ghostbusters does have a few positives chris hemsworth gave me a few laughs though the mimbo gag ran a little thin and he wasnt a likable character in particular hemsworths scenes with kristen wiig were especially funny speaking of which it was kristen wiig that really carried this film and her performance alone elevated the movie from unwatchable dreck to somewhat tolerable i have heard others praise kate mckinnons performance to me it was simply hammy and out of place     i am left confused by the 70 fresh rating i am utterly baffled that anyone could offer this movie more than 1 or 2 stars on even the most generous scale put the politics and nostalgia aside this is an objectively bad movie with very few redeeming qualities    i hope ghostbusters gets another chance as a franchise hell i hope the cast gets another chance too but for the love of god sony do not let paul feig ever touch another big budget project again
Oct 4 2016,positive,actually a pretty decent story well directed and well acted the biggest problem with this movie is that its a remake of a classic if they wouldnt have tied this to the ghostbusters franchise it would have been a much bigger hit
Oct 4 2016,positive,i liked this a whole lot more than i expected to
Oct 4 2016,positive,as always wiig and mccarhty deliver their scenes on point and so as mckinnon and jones while it may lack some originality it doesnt rely on the original as much as some where saying creating an enjoyable and nice movie for kids and adults
Oct 4 2016,positive,while ghostbusters brings a wrong definition of feminism to the big screen they had me at the first scene
Oct 4 2016,positive,amazing one of the best movies of the year so much funnier than the originals
Oct 4 2016,negative,awful a regurgitated abomination of the gb legacy put forth by the original cast and creators
Oct 4 2016,negative,this movie was so bad i had to create an account to leave a review i read some audience and critic reviews and im just astonished that anyone thought this was even a slightly good movie if there was a way to filter out the critics who said this movie was good so they dont continue to mess up the tomato ratings i would  i didnt smile or chuckle or anything not even once the only explanation i have for the good reviews is that people are trying to encourage and support women in leading roles im sure women are equally if not more horrified than i am at this movie im really just speechless and feeling sad about the future of movies if this is considered good or even passable     to summarize   there is nothing funny or interesting or clever in this movie to be fair i couldnt tolerate sitting through the whole thing after the first 30 minutes so i had it going while i was doing something else at the same time the positive reviews are just from people who want to support women or people who have an entirely different sense of humor than me let me stress that not only is it not funny it is horribly boring and possibly the worst movie ive ever seen in my life cant think of anything worse at the moment
Oct 4 2016,positive,ghostbusters has its problems mainly the action and special effects which are as cheesy as they were in the original and the third act did drag a lot but the cast is absolutely fantastic and all four of these ladies are excellent with the standout one being kristen wiig who is so likable and consistently hilarious the plot is solid the humor is very good and the film is so much fun that it is of course very underrated and much better than that cheesy mediocrity that is the original ghostbusters
Oct 4 2016,negative,tone is off way too punched up and overloaded with jokes
Oct 4 2016,positive,funny nostalgic  too pc  tries too hard writing is corny and there are no shining performances
Oct 4 2016,negative,bad not good it is just as bad as i hoped it wouldnt be  but it was
Oct 3 2016,negative,the sad killing of a classic
Oct 3 2016,positive,hysterical  why is this not getting better reviews
Oct 3 2016,negative,should not have even been an idea to be made worst remake i have ever seen i wish i could lose the memory
Oct 3 2016,negative,if you like napoleon dynamite youll like this movie that is not an endorsement
Oct 3 2016,negative,who thought this was funny who thought this was fun who thought this was any good at all this movie proved all the haters right the script is just so goddamn awful and thats half the problem leslie jones cannot act mccarthy thinks stupidfunny mckinnon is obnoxious and the straight woman wiig is just that it didnt make laugh once it didnt make me smile it was just mildly infuriating from start to finish
Oct 3 2016,positive,i think its better than trailer
Oct 3 2016,negative,horrible remake and the almost two hours youll never get back
Oct 3 2016,negative,with the cast  its highprofile look  i didnt think it could be this  nothing its not even bad its just an entire movie of dull drab nothing really funny or interesting happening absolute waste of time
Oct 3 2016,positive,i wish it was a continuation instead of a remake its asking us to pretend one of the greatest movies of all time doesnt exist and these are the ghostbusters instead why did they do that the original cast does show up here and there in little cameos why why why did they not just instead start the original cast off as the ghostbusters and the new people take over  it bums me out oh well i need to just get over it because there is a lot to enjoy here and i must say this movie had several of the best 3d shots of any movie ive ever seen the other offensive thing about this movie is how beyond stupid the male character acts its just not even human its so stupid other than those two issues this shows promise and id rather watch this than many other movies that get churned out  i think without the 3d something is lost though much better than the atrocious last sequel to indiana jones or the star wars prequels until jj abrams came along
Oct 2 2016,negative,it was very boring and lifeless i dont think i laughed once it wasnt even funny bad where you can laugh at it it was tedious bad where i would have straight up walked out had i not been at a drivein with my friends the comedy was dull and predictable and the characters were completely unlikeable
Oct 2 2016,negative,stunk dialogue was such a dud completely boring and unoriginal doesnt even compare to the original this is the stupidest slapstick and demoralizing comedy the dumbing down of america i guess i dont know why i expected more and a ghost that resembles baphomet really thats what hollywood is all about now  very disappointed loved the first one though
Oct 2 2016,negative,this movie is horrible
Oct 2 2016,positive,them its watching for any fan of original movieand its not preachy i thought it would just be a bunch of feminism garbage im not saying you shouldnt have equal rights i am saying dont change a beloved movie because of your political stance however this movie was funny and entertaining but had some shortcomings
Oct 2 2016,positive,loved it super cheesy but funny and i loved all the cameos
Oct 2 2016,negative,mediocrity is no reason for a remake not a bad movie not a good one worthy of neither praise nor disparagement as another reviewer put it
Oct 2 2016,neutral,not as good as originals they based it to much on the comedy but still good
Oct 2 2016,neutral,i was expecting worse not great but not awful
Oct 2 2016,positive,woo hoo    theyre back and better than ever    great fresh characters and for you purists fun little cameos with the original cast along with snarky references that if you dont get you just werent paying attention the first time    so much fun      im afraid my husband only gave it a b  though as he preferred the more laid back pace and dry humor of the first movie while i loved the quick snappy timing and goofy quirky dialoged that was laugh out loud funny  but hey thats what makes life interesting right  and the fact that every actor was pitch perfect for their role just proves that snl has produced some wonderful comedians kate mckinnon i gave you 3 stars alone   and for you non snl cast members you were perfect too sigourney you can do no wrong       one more point you trolls that felt compelled to trash this movie before it was even started theres at least one zinger aimed right for you shamed you probably wont have the sense of humor to appreciate it  
Oct 2 2016,negative,just fails overall the jokes not funny  and the plot is predictible its like the first ghostbusters but without the good parts
Oct 2 2016,negative,careless attitude in the universe of ghostbusters dumb humor
Oct 2 2016,positive,its a very fun movie i really like kristen wiig performance
Oct 2 2016,negative,because no stars is not an option
Oct 1 2016,negative,we were actually excited to see what they had done with the new all girl team of the ghost busters     it was so bad that we turned it off 40 minutes into the movie   the acting was horrific the mood the jokes everything about this movie just shows how much in trouble holly wood is what horrific rubbish they are coughing out and people are liking    who the hell sat in the editing room and thought mmm this is a good movie    it is horrific  a dim shadow of the original    very sad indeed
Oct 1 2016,positive,did not deserve the hate it got loved the cast only thing i can say was different was the fact that it wasnt in the same universe as the original
Oct 1 2016,positive,i thought it was excellent great comedic timing by all and fun fun fun awesome homage to the og
Oct 1 2016,negative,once again we see another movie flop the movie isnt bad because you have some talent on the screen the issue was that like most new features they had an agenda that had little to do with the story the gay undertones played out like a clique fan pack
Oct 1 2016,positive,not horrible i laughed im betting it would have gotten more love if it wasnt a remake
Oct 1 2016,negative,dreadful  nobody will be talking about this film in 30 years the performances are excellently acted but the storyline is absolutely mince awful just awful
Oct 1 2016,positive,i almost didnt watch this because i heard bad things but it was the funniest movie ive seen all year so glad i watched it and i highly recommend it to everyone who likes a good comedy
Oct 1 2016,neutral,yes there are lots of miserably boring and repetitive jokes  unfunny references in this film that said it still isnt as bad as much of the crap i see these days not horrible not great
Oct 1 2016,positive,surprisingly funny and entertainment much better than what everybody said it was
Oct 1 2016,positive,watch it with a open mind
Oct 1 2016,neutral,i wanted this to be better than mediocre
Oct 1 2016,negative,when are the studios going to stop trying to reboot the classics ghostbusters is a great franchise which will never diesome nice nods to the original but when all is said and done this movie was just a huge waste of time and money
Oct 1 2016,negative,this is garbage it is the exact same movie as the first one except with no humor  a weaker villain and a even weaker script these actors dont deserve this movie but whats worst is the critics giving this a high score  because they are all female i cant say how boring awful this movie is and how the critics gave this a thumbs up because of the bandwagon effect but i am too disappointed with this movie to even care to give it anymore attention
Oct 1 2016,positive,four stars is generous but 35 isnt fair as a guy who remembers standing in line in jr high for the original ghostbusters i really enjoyed this one the cast did a great job and kate mckinnon stole the show the times square battle scene alone was worth the price of admission and the thrillerlike dance video scene was hilarious for once the critics got the tomato rating right id put this at as a solid mid 70 fresh scorenot sure what the problem was with the user score
Oct 1 2016,negative,this had a huge potential to be a canon sequel and restart an awesome franchise having four women follow the path of the original ghostbusters was a great idea bill and dan could have passed the torch on but this movie like many recent others hides behind a so called empowering of female characters to get sales and then it sets them up to fail sadly the director turned the movie into a bland senseless thing that goes nowhere for two hours kate mckinnon does a great job and so does everyone else in the cast with the exception of melissa mccarthy who i find poor at acting and comedy but the plot and its execution ruin everything for everyone paul feig managed to get a commercial success out of some cheap movies in the past and thats why he got to do this project not because hes good at directing or because he cares about female characters or the ghostbusters fanchise this whole thing has been depressing i hope a new reboot can be created in the future that isnt as poor as this
Oct 1 2016,negative,the only one with all the jokes was the blond she and the fx were the only things that made this worth watching also one of the cameos
Sep 30 2016,neutral,movie is super corny not funny at all and some things are just unnecessary being a fan of ghostbusters im really disappointed
Sep 30 2016,negative,one of the worst movies i have ever seen
Sep 30 2016,positive,passes the 6 laugh test
Sep 30 2016,positive,exceptional movie love the female version much better very talented cast i enjoyed it very much
Sep 30 2016,positive,i dont see why people thought this movie was bad i had a terrific time watching it with plenty of laughs
Sep 30 2016,positive,i wanted to hate it but seeing it firsthand it doesnt do a bad job in keeping in the spectrum of what was needed in terms of a ghostbuster film while the unnecessary male counterparts were unevenly portrayed to instigate a feminist agenda if you can overlook the silly sexualised quips its a fun movie when your not trying to rip it to shreds    1 star because of ghost dick weakness
Sep 30 2016,negative,ghost corps huh opening credits and straight away the first sign of a planned multimovie franchisethey never learn anyway who ya gonna call certainly not these guys quick pause for my readers sides to stop splitting oh shit wait i meant gals oh christ now ive done it no but seriously who are you gonna call here a better script writer perhaps better cast better effects another director hell just a completely different movie to this but how bad could this really be i aint afraid of no gaudy garish neon clearly all cgi ghostsactually i am shocked and horrified at just how scarily bad they actually were    right so things start off in much the same way the classic 84 movie did we are given a brief little vignette that sets up the basis of the plot its about ghosts that will eventually lead to greater things when i say the same as the 84 original i meant literally the opening scene is done in the exact same way complete with the legendary ray parker jr theme tune accompanying the films main title cardshot now at this point i was actually onboard for the ride believe it or not the intro sequence was actually pretty creepy it looked quite good it intrigued me a nice tone of lighthearted horror and when ray parker jrs tune kicked in i actually felt a nostalgic lump in my throat as if id just been zapped back to my childhood thats as far as it goes though because apparently the supernatural incident we see has no consequences or follow up whatsoever the curator bloke of this old 19th century stately home seems to get attacked killed possessed unsure but after seemingly being doomed he just pops up later completely fine and that story arc is never followed up for the rest of movie    its from this point onwards when we meet the new characters that virtually everything spirals out of control in an impressive fiery fireball of failure you have the chubby mccarthy who i guess plays the ray stantz type character because she has the same love enthusiasm and dedication to science and the supernatural that ray hadplus body shape wiig whos the more straightlaced apprehensive character which could be venkman but without the smug dry humour mckinnon im guessing is a live action female version of the cartoon egon spengler from ithe real ghostbustersi same technical mind but here shes basically loopy lastly jones presumably would be the zeddmore type character because shes the streetwise bluecollar token black character admittedly the female characters are more of there own thing here there is a hint of the classic quartet of course but generally theyre relatively unique which is good    the main story revolves around one human villain called rowan a mad scientist and occultist who wishes to open a portal to the ghost world to bring about the apocalypse in order to do this he is placing these strange devices along spiritual ley lines in new york city in order to charge them up and create a vortex at the exact point where these ancient ley lines cross or meet rowan has a much larger device that when activated along with the charged up ley lines will rip a hole into the spirit world oh and its where he conveniently works too sounds reasonable doesnt it and it is accept for the fact that nothing is really explained rowan is basically a bit nuts right ok thats fine but why does he want to do this just because hes nuts well no apparently its because hes a bit of a loser an outcast with no friends and hes depressedand thats the reason secondly what are these devices hes placing along the ley lines how does he make them how does he know how to charge the ley lines how did he make such a huge single device how does he fund all this and of course how does he manage to get away with making a whopping big device in the basement of the hotel where he works then as the plot progresses we discover that rowan plans to kill himself in order to lead a ghost army when the apocalypse starts but buthow the hell does he intend to carry that out why would he be able to come back as a ghost does he have some kind of special gift or powers why would ghosts follow this guy how does he manage to not only come back as a ghost but a seriously powerful ghost just like gozer the gozerian    around this main premise you have all the standard fare which you basically got in the original the ladies create their own equipment and develop it over the course of the film naturally all the gear is strewn with various flashing leds because that apparently makes it look cooler they manage to pick up an old hearse to use for transportation which they call ecto 1 because of course they do they get themselves natty ghost catching uniforms which make them look like garbage collectors seriously under designed was that the best production could come up with grey jumpsuits with orange gofaster stripes and they trap ghosts when i say trap ghosts i mean one one single entity with a huge fuck off ghost trap that looks like a torpedo the film is called ghostbusters but we only see them trap one ghost they also have nowhere to store the ghost once caught this leads me to the finale of the movie where the ladies have developed their equipment so much they are now able to kill ghosts i seriously have no idea what happens here the proton packs sort of lasso the ghosts and enable them to be dragged along the floorfor what reason the girls are tossing ghosts around throwing them into each other sucking them into a ghost chipper type thing punching them yes and generally blowing them up somehow so is this universe you can effectively kill a ghost of reduce it to ectoplasm im guessing they would call it that seeing as they rippedoff everything else by punching it and sucking it into a chipper type machine i wont even go into the awful slow motion action sequence where holtzmann does some kind of john wooneo shit with two pistol sized particle throwers    whilst all this slapstick action is going off the effects offer us a mixed result two sides of a coin for sure whilst the general look of the movie is naturally very glossy colourful and slick it cant help but look like a cartoon there are numerous shots that have been blatantly copied from the 84 classic but it still cant detract from the fact the film looks childish overall this also goes for the general tone of the flick too it really doesnt know what the hell its going for lighthearted kids comedy edgy horror comedy mainstream comedy feig comedy etcthe equipment looks just like i expected it to plastic and obviously fake no amount of flashing leds can change that but luckily they have kept the iconic particle thrower beam close to what we all know and love yes i realise thats me being hypocritical as ive complained about them rippingoff other things from the 84 original but this was one thing that needed to remain anything else simply wouldnt do as for the cgiwell it doesnt help matters at all thats not to say its bad it just doesnt fit this franchise as many have already said the cgi looks ridiculous and much like some other movies such as haunted mansion and the iscoobydooi flicks the large green dragondemon ghost in the concert sequence actually looked like something from ithe real ghostbustersi its virtually all bright neon effects making almost every scene with ghosts look like the interior of a nightclub why would ghosts be so bright and colourful this also doesnt help the actors who are clearly standing in front of greenscreens my only positive is rowan in logo form who does look pretty good and made me wonder how sweet a modern mr stay puft would look these days other than that the 84 original effects still blow this out of the water    the deciding factor in this movies downfall is quite frankly the fact its hideously unfunny end of the day its a comedy but it sucks the ladies try their best to come across as amusing and its just embarrassing to watch cringeworthy at the best of times the performances are muted and bland at best mccarthy is simply mccarthy yet again wiig is dull as dishwater and clearly not really enjoying herself and ive no fucking clue what mckinnon thought she was doing because it wasnt funny in the slightest oh but she was so quirky off the wall and uniqueyeahno she wasnt she looked unique but acted like a fool lastly we have the mighty walking controversy that is jones amazingly best of the quartet and easily the most relatable and believable whod of thought it huh although still have no idea why her character would quit her stable dependable job on the subway to join a risky venture in ghost catching that seemed totally unrealistic to me no one would do that without some form of plan or guarantee in the original zeddmore needed a job so he took what he could get that made sense not this so thats the four ladies anything else oh yes chris hemsworth the hypocritical highly ironic reverse sexist character that somehow evaded feigs all out politically correct all accepting agenda or did it was this a deliberate move by feig along with the reshot scenes of meta references to the internet rage and fanboys and the casual manbashing we see liberally sprinkled throughout well i think its pretty obvious now from what you can read and watch online but that aside this character was annoyingly shit and an insult to the franchise    oh yeah way bwayb too many needless pointless cameos did the movie need a cameo from ozzy osbourne or any of the original cast they could of at least not made them so bloody blatant it gave the movie a zoolanderesque vibe at times for christs sake what was the point of crowbarring in a cameo from sigourney weaver in the end credits come to think of it what was the point of the slimer cameo other than gratuitous pandering to the fanboys to try and get them into cinemas but they couldnt even do that right horrific cgi aside they gave the spook a female partner basically slimer with lipstick and a wig what the literal fuck its things like this that truly make you wonder whats going on behind the scenes who the hell thought bthatb would be a good idea    so is this movie passable and enjoyable as some professional critics dubiously wrote well sort ofif you completely put aside all the ghostbusters franchise aspect of it and look at it as a completely independent movie in that case then yes you could say its reasonably entertaining or maybe as a live action adaptation of the cartoon at best but only in those cases is the movie as bad as some have made it out to be yes im afraid it isas a reboot of such a legendary iconic franchise as ghostbusters yes it is that bad shamefully bad the humour is seriously lacking with terrible dialog theres no real tension anywhere no real threats you never worry about the characters safety you dont really care about the characters and the entire finale was a huge anticlimax the film just didnt engage me in any way everything was simply mundane no excitement no thrills nothing at one point i did wonder why the film didnt look new yorkish to me turns out they filmed in boston for petes sake i mean seriously if you cant even do the location justice how can you expect to do the film justice this in turn leads to a world that isnt believable because it consists of sets greenscreen sets and locations that arent new york     basically this doesnt really feel like a proper supernatural comedy or fantasy movie it feels much more like a parody of the genres and a poor parody at that the whole thing is subpar at times shockingly shallow limited and chock full of tropes cliches and stereotypes whilst at the same time merrily showing complete contempt for the main target demographic the dare i say male fanbase after all those years all the speculation and talk what a completely wasted opportunity which unfortunately looks to have put the kibosh on the future of the franchise
Sep 30 2016,neutral,to slapstick should have been so much better as a darker comedy  the comedy has no intelligence almost on par with childrens cartoon comedy the three scientists act like simpletons for the entire movie its like someone has combined the three stooges with ghostbusters  hopefully someone will make a better remake soon it could have been made to appeal to adults as well as 1315 year olds     overall a very poor effort really not for adults
Sep 30 2016,positive,funnier than the original films
Sep 30 2016,negative,just dont watch it
Sep 30 2016,negative,wasnt that good did not lol once
Sep 30 2016,negative,juvenile humor and continuous references to the original and to other movies really make one ask why the reboot was made at all  add to that the silly sexist distraction easily debunked looking at the reception of aliens ripley or the kill bill characters
Sep 29 2016,positive,the story is fairly predictable and nothing innovating about the movie but all 4 actress were amazing all of them are funny in different ways and what i like the most about the film is little jokes that each one has
Sep 29 2016,positive,great movie kids loved it and so did i
Sep 29 2016,negative,not at all as bad as im sure some people wanted it to be wiig and mccarthy were pretty funny but leslie jones was just annoying i guess being loud all the time is funny in the end too many non funny parts to out weigh the good ones
Sep 29 2016,negative,this was so bad it took me 4 sittings to get through just such a bad script and look chris hemsworth was the only redeeming thing in the film
Sep 29 2016,positive,great casting has an original feel while remaining true to its roots was not a huge fan of the plot as it felt gimikey
Sep 29 2016,positive,this was and still remains to be my favourite movie ever
Sep 29 2016,negative,what an insult to the original
Sep 29 2016,positive,so this review is obviously a little late but best late than never    where to even begin with this movie    the cameos of the previous cast members excluding harold ramis dr egon as well as slimer and the michelin man was truky enjoyable to experience i even liked the fact that they went with a full female cast    however i couldnt help but feel that they went overboard on the comedic side of things the fan and the writer within me wanted a movie similar in structure to its predecessors in terms of a more serious movie with some whitty commentary     i felt that there was quite a few angles they couldve played on they couldve done a tribute to harold ramis by basing a storyline around 2 aging ghostbusters who attend the funeral of their beloved friend partner and fellow ghostbuster dr egon the two are unhealthy one from cancer and the other is partially immobile from the wear and tear the packs took on his body leading both to partially mentor the new cadets from here they coukd have injected that funnyblight hearted side we all know and love while still staying true    again this is but one channel they could have taken that would have maybe satisfied fans of the previous 2 movies and at the same time by sticking to an all female cast they couldve reinvigorated the franchise    i give this 35 because i loved certain elements and disliked others    cant say id be rushing to see the second installment if it comes
Sep 29 2016,positive,fun tp watch  light hearted entertainment worth a watch
Sep 29 2016,positive,this reboot was not as bad as i thought it would be it was entertaining and there were funny moments that made me laugh though i think leslie jones deserved to be a scientist too she did a superb job in her roll most of the laugh out loud moment were from her     the only problem i had was the script was written for females dont get me wrong i love woman in movies and i think they should star as main characters more often but i feel this movie should have been written for ghostbusters and not for females they put too much emphases on them being women instead of being brilliant misunderstood misfits     in short i would love to see a sequel if they write as ghostbusters and not for female ghostbusters
Sep 28 2016,positive,despite what people have to say the movie wasnt that bad it had its moments of awkwardness as far as the actors and writing was concerned but all in all the movie was harmless was it the original no were there things better than the original sure the movie knew what its source material was and knew how large the fan base was there have been previous adaptations where the film makers took a steaming pile on the original source and thankfully ghostbusters wasnt victim to it they paid homage to not only the original film but the 90s cartoon as well the movie even had respectable cameos from the original actors even honoring the late harold ramis aka egon now again this was a harmless film i would personally recommend it speaking as a ghostbusters fan but you know as well as i do if the remake isnt your cup of tea the original is going nowhere
Sep 28 2016,positive,hilarious and magnificent with a very remarkable cast a movie worth watching
Sep 28 2016,negative,this film managed to turn a great original into another crap remake the film aint funny and probably the worst film i have watched this year do yourself a favour and go back and watch the original
Sep 28 2016,negative,one of the worst remakes i have ever seen  uninteresting not funny and way too slow  im sure the actors did what they could but it just wasnt very good
Sep 28 2016,positive,the major criticisms ive heard were it not the original and it uses a lot of special effect in this kind of movie well duh what else would you expect but what i found when i saw it was a funny and cool film with character that seem really  well fleshed admittedly a couple of the side character were pretty 2 dimensional this is a film franchise that many people have so many found memorys of and i think this film did an amazing job of keeping the franchise that is so well love alive i this this latest version of the ghostbusters i hope they make at least 1 more if anyone hasnt seen it i fully recommend it and to advice disregarding anyone and everyone who might as well be starting there review with back in my day
Sep 28 2016,positive,i got what i expected and a little bit more
Sep 28 2016,negative,a huge swing and miss that fails to conjure laughs or spook up scares ghostbusters is unable to live up to the expectations that its talented cast and filmmaker bring with them this attempt at rebooting the classic 1984 supernatural comedy is all kinds of bad neither funny scary or in any way memorable save for its capacity to bring on cringes at a record rate the fault lies not with the new cast its the lackluster script and the mediocre movie that theyre saddled with fans of ivan reitmans original film will recognise plenty of reverential nods not least the celebrated theme song plus cameo appearances by several of the 1984 cast the reboot of ghostbusters feels like a saturday night live comedy sketch stretched well beyond its natural running time to feature length its initial appeal very quickly wears off the shaggy and sagging plot together with the ancient special effects combine for a load of not very original or entertaining slime ultimately ghostbusters supports the argument that hollywood would rather recycle a known product for a guaranteed buck than take any real chances and thats too bad because the people involved are capable of better combined with a concerning lack of laughs and a chemistry so nonexistent that its practically a spectre itself and ghosbusters is one bust of a reboot    verdict not so hot  negative reaction these films are truly terrible films they are not the worst things ever made but they are definitely awful and should not be seen by anyone films that are rated 15 or 2 stars
Sep 28 2016,positive,pleasantly surprised at how fun this was not better than the original but has good humour and great scenes
Sep 27 2016,positive,wasnt as bad as people make it seem wasnt the best movie but not bad
Sep 27 2016,neutral,i had been looking forward to this iteration of ghostbusters as it was in development i had my concerns that it would be a paul feig movie masquerading as a ghostbusters movie this had nothing to do with the gender of the cast and more to do with the style of humor and writing well it was exactly as i expected in terms of writing and tone but it was better than i expected overall it was fine until the third act nothing remarkable nothing special just fine there were parts that i liked there were parts i rolled my eyes at but i could still almost approve it however the entire third act was full of good ideas and poor execution some of it really poor execution oh and the fx were so hit and miss the proton streams and a few ghosts looked great but so many ghosts also looked terrible i did genuinely like the majority of the casting though especially mccarthy in a tamer role and mckinnons quirk what sucks is i feel it wouldnt have taken too much change to make this a good movie maybe a few more drafts and some more vfx budgetdirection sigh
Sep 27 2016,negative,its boring its shit i can make better shit then this the originals is better you fucking assholes if you say this movie ghost busters is better than the originals im going to stab you you asshole it is the shitestes movie of 2016 i agree with angry joe
Sep 27 2016,negative,awful  waste of time
Sep 27 2016,negative,just watch classic ones waste of time and money
Sep 27 2016,negative,yellow   ruined an easy movie remake sad
Sep 27 2016,negative,like the lazy approach the filmmakers took to this reboot im not going to continue my review in sentences but short grunts unimaginative no cohesive  structure lame story worst villain ever unfunny tv and not cinematic no sense of dread or atmosphere screenplay dire script mic drop
Sep 27 2016,positive,my daughter loved it
Sep 27 2016,negative,mostly unfunny and boring two things ghostbusters should never be
Sep 26 2016,neutral,good idea to b remake it but the cast choice and storyline killed it mccarthy is alway decent but this wasnt a good movie for her watch it when it is free
Sep 26 2016,positive,extended cut im prepared to admit i was wrong about this one its got the spirit of ghostbusters all throughout it and its a blast mckinnon kicks so much ass and would fit right along the guys in the other movies
Sep 26 2016,positive,its was a fun movie to watch
Sep 26 2016,positive,kate mckinnon  enough said  otherwise the special effects completely take over
Sep 26 2016,positive,definitely well done movie
Sep 26 2016,negative,new ghostbusters is worse than i expected
Sep 26 2016,positive,i really loved this movie dont listen to all the haters and internet trolls i have seen the impact this movie is making on young girls they are believing that they can be ghostbusters scientists and badasses i ended up seeing this movie 6 times in theaters and every time the theater was full of people of all ages laughing their heads off booyeah emphasis on the boo
Sep 26 2016,positive,this wasnt terrible to anyone that hated it what were you expecting
Sep 26 2016,positive,an interesting personal observation of my male friends opinions of this movie friends who are either married or in a relationship enjoyed the movie and thought it was pretty good the friends who are single hated this movie and made an almost dramaqueen spectacle of berating it on facebook    as for my own opinion i enjoyed the film a lot all of the lead characters are just naturally funny people and you can tell they had fun making this movie special effects didnt distract anymore than other cgi heavy movies and unlike the original the ghosts were actually scary looking an enjoyable halloween movie that adults and kids can enjoy
Sep 26 2016,negative,if youre using the tomatometer to judge a film as i do then be warned that this is no way close to a usual 73 fresh movie more like a 4050    presumably the critics felt they had to go some way to overturn the negative misogynistic criticism of the movie before we had even seen the trailer    the four main leads however were by far and away the best thing about this movie the rest of it completely sucked  the script the plot andy garcia the special effects the lack of tension the postcredits scene and things that just didnt make any sense    this isnt a spoiler as such but there is one climactic scene where the army and ghostbusters are hit by a wall of green supernatural stuff and the army fall asleep during which time they appear to be trodden on by a massive ghost who does damage to skyscrapers and taxis when everything comes good in the end the army do a sleepy where am i wake up sequence and the damage to the city is undone why why why     i wanted to like it from the off as the characters were fairly likeable but it was just a confusing boring mess of a movie very disappointed     by all means make a point that the haters went too far and aimed a lot of frankly disgusting vitriol at the actors and creators of this movie but dont try telling me that this movie is better than as good as central intelligence or snatch or get him to the greek or iron man 2 or forrest gump the last 3 were all 72    the critics have let everyone down here    if you want to watch it out of curiosity or because youre on a long haul flight then fine but otherwise id give this one a wide berth
Sep 25 2016,negative,watched this movie  more akin to a really horrible my fair lady style musical with a complete rip of the original movie  the women in the roles were not bad but you can only do so much acting if a movie is shit the best acting in the world cant polish that turd   i did love the creative new ghost busting weapons and laughed my ass off with the grenade scene that was creative   the main villain turning into the ghostbuster logo ghost well to be blunt had me yawn best parts for me the nerdy woman ghostbuster who builds the devices she totally nailed the role and the slimer family stealing the ghostbusters ride that was epically funny the dance number at the end was total shit i would have rather seen an expanded fight scene with the ghost army to be completely honest and maybe more in the way of originality then to completely rip of an original concept and repackage that shit     again movie fucking sucked but not because of the women in it but because pauls vision well lets just say next movie he makes get him some glasses because it isnt 2020
Sep 25 2016,positive,a funny new version for a new generation
Sep 25 2016,positive,good special effects story is not bad great cast   too bad it wasnt funny
Sep 25 2016,positive,not sure what the critics are watching here this was barely an average movie certified fresh i dont think so just because funny people are in it does not make it good or funny
Sep 25 2016,negative,this video was disney channel quality the jokes were literally written for 8 year olds campy and over the top much of the acting was insulting
Sep 25 2016,positive,probably as good as it was ever going to be    good sfx  a few laughs     710
Sep 25 2016,negative,its watchable but its nothing like the originals and shouldnt of never been named ghostbusters
Sep 25 2016,neutral,25 stars  actually not terrible i expected this to flop like 70 year old nipples this was not because of the female cast but due to the fact im not an admirer of the originals reboots are often pointless moneymaking turds and i do not find melissa mccarthy or kristen wiig particular funny i had never properly seen the other two lady leads before and to be fair kate mckinnon injects necessary kooky enthusiasm into the group while leslie jones aka the female tracy morgan demonstrates she can be funny when not shouting unfortunately she shouts 90 of the time and is sometimes limited to the africanamerican stereotype though the main foursome do little to change my perception of their comedic talents a reasonable amount of the written comedy is decent there will be few chuckles from the wacky situational humour while the cameos and subordinate characters especially chris hemsworth contribute good material nevertheless some of the expected shortfalls were present mainly the flimsy plot it slightly improves on the 1984 movie but retains the same repetitive action stupidness and lack of logic even within this distinct world    this reboot will not convert nonfollowers so i am still not gonna call ghostbusters when i need a quality movie to watch however it suffices as light family entertainment even with pressure from sexist internet trolls and the ghost of the much loved original movies lurking over it
Sep 25 2016,negative,dont waste your money
Sep 25 2016,positive,this was an ok film but some parts were really not well exploited the humour coming from kate and leslie was quite refreshing however the story and action falls flat when it became serious i though that the dancing in the generic should have been in the movie chris h character is absolutely fun we didnt see enough of the bad guy and thats a problemit makes the overall plot generic his motivation were shallow and barely considered the fx were pretty good in my book i give it 60
Sep 25 2016,negative,lame remake love the girls of snl but not here
Sep 25 2016,positive,a very decent remake of the original ghostbusters movie only with main cast made of women with good comedy skills and great potential also a variety of many different technological innovations which lacked in the original
Sep 25 2016,positive,the latest edition rebooted after 32 years is an all women starcast it has a fair share of comedy but definitely not as great as the 1984 classic nevertheless a funny time pass movie
Sep 25 2016,negative,i didnt hate this as much as i think i was supposed to it was poorly crafted but the potential for something good was there
Sep 25 2016,negative,when a reboot of beloved classic ghostbusters was announced the internet went into a furore   the vitriol was so bad that the cast  crew were subject to abuse sexism and racism before a single frame had been seen the first trailer did nothing to put the geek community at ease becoming the most disliked video in youtube history sony pictures director paul feig and even some of the original cast all tried in vain to try to stem the tide asking for people to give the film a chance and in some cases giving abuse back to the online community ghostbusters 2016 never stood a chance now i do not condone the abuse but understand the love for a classic film but i unlike many was willing to give this a chanceunfortunately its awful  following a ghost invasion of manhattan paranormal enthusiasts erin gilbert wigg and abby yates mccarthy nuclear engineer jillian holtzmann mckinnon and subway worker patty tolan jones band together to stop the otherworldly threat  the cast try in vain to make this amusing the four leads are all gifted comediennes given the right material but there is not one laugh to be found here funny lines drop with a thudd and  some of the situations are embarrassing  the characters are poor too wigg  mccarthys characters make no impact at all jones character is an annoying stereotypical sassy black lady that has been seen a million times before and mckinnons character is just strange  thank god then for chris hemsworth as new receptionist kevin he is extremely stupid but gets the job based on his looks abit sexist that hemsworth is never funny or even amusing but his performance is at least watchable  even the cameos from most of the original cast do nothing to liven things up murray weaver etc must have been paid well to appear in this turkey  director paul feig has had some success   with female led comedy in the past he directed bridesmaids and spy but he misses the mark by a mile here the direction is poor and he cowrote the abysmal script  one slight positive are the ghosts which look ok in terms of design as do the redesigned proton packs traps  ghostbusters 2016 is the worst film i have seen in a very long time and sullies the brilliant original and its pretty good sequel the female cast are not the problem but no jokes poor scripting  story dire direction are major issues  who you gonna call not this disasteravoid
Sep 24 2016,positive,very nice movie after the trailers and the backlash i thought i was wasting my time but glad it was well worth it i specially loooved holtzmannkate mckinnon      some stupidity in the finale though like the three ghostbusters not even caring about missing their fourth member erinkristen wiig and she just running around like an idiot instead heading straight to the ghostbusters hq then erin when in the portal talking so comfortable to abby as if nothng happened also the cheesy talk bw all of them in the end  this made me change the 45 to a 355
Sep 24 2016,positive,couldnt believe how good it was and had most of the cast from the original
Sep 24 2016,neutral,its not funny its not dramatic its not scary its just blah
Sep 24 2016,negative,what a terrible movie i hope they dont make another one
Sep 24 2016,negative,truly awful devoid of any laughs soulless and dull beyond belief the cameos are awful as well harold ramis will be turning in his grave
Sep 24 2016,positive,its alright i prefer the older ghostbuster movies
Sep 24 2016,negative,what an embarrassmentworst film ive seen since man of steel
Sep 24 2016,positive,that was a lot of fun and good female characters also great soundtrack 
Sep 24 2016,negative,wow how do you ruin a classic this movie disrespected the original in so many ways horrible
Sep 24 2016,negative,this was not that funny and a missed opportunity the actors are talented but the script editing and story sucked better luck next time
Sep 24 2016,negative,finally saw the movie was absolutely terrible not funny at all completely missing the charm of the original im surprised it has 56 audience score
Sep 24 2016,positive,having been subject to controversy when the first trailer was published online this 2016 female update on the classic ghostbusters may not be as good as the original but the film still provokes enough laughs and charm with decent enough cgi to help the film remain a winner in its own right
Sep 24 2016,negative,a movie that makes me wish i had adhd so i could enjoy it  thanks for wasting a decent cast of characters on your stupid storyboard baby bullshit shit fest  someone walked in and tried to make this bad  fuck
Sep 24 2016,negative,what in the world
Sep 24 2016,negative,is sad they used feminism to try wash out the shortcomings of this film more contrasting against how great the original films were
Sep 23 2016,positive,just pretended watching a new episode of snl
Sep 23 2016,negative,it genuinely upsets me that they used the name and music from original ghostbusters
Sep 23 2016,negative,some funny actresses some just loud and annoying worst remake ever does not compare to the original clasic
Sep 23 2016,negative,remake into a garbage  should have known earlier if knowing melissa is in it
Sep 23 2016,positive,i really like this movie i really dont see why people hated this movie so much  they shouldve tied in the other movies other than that i really enjoyed this
Sep 23 2016,positive,lets face it this film got allot of stick for many reasons the fact that you should never remake a classic recasting an all male cast to an all female cast which will put off fans of the original its like rebooting sex and the city with a male cast it just didnt make sense anyway after all of the hate spread before its release when the film came out it was quite a pleasant surprise i wanted to hate the film but i liked the idea theres allot of nods to the original and theres cameos by the original ghostbusters playing different roles so its not a sequel just so you know the story never tried anything different really the effects and action was pretty good with some funny humour most of the time too i cant comment on the 3d as i watched the 2d version its much better than i expected but nothing on the original it might be loved by the new audience but if youre fans of the originals it may annoy you abit
Sep 23 2016,positive,pleasantly surprised by this instead of trying to remake the original they cleverly had a storyline of their own and used many cameos and inhouse jokes to keep the movie linear to the first ghostbusters
Sep 23 2016,negative,i was so excited to see the new ghostbusters but after watching i was so disappointed dont get me wrong it was an ok movie but they could have done so much more with it  i dont care how good the special effects was the original ghostbusters will always be the best
Sep 23 2016,positive,funny with good action but cringy as hell dancing scenes
Sep 23 2016,positive,dont know why there was so much hate i enjoyed it the only complaints i really have is awful reworkings of the music
Sep 23 2016,positive,well where to begin this movie is not terrible the beats that made the original two films classic are there build the team establish the big bad they gain notoriety introduce cynics big bad makes final move cynics call ghostbusters big bad defeated    the characters however all seem to fit one mold you could have easily exchanged anyone if the actresses for another excluding leslie jones who played the newcomer non scientific new york history buff quite well    the characters in the original all had their own quirks and ways of handling things it gave the team a more dynamic feel for the ghost girls and yes that is a quote from the movie itself the team was more one dimensional that is my only real gripe about the film     the visual effects were great the big bad was fun chris hemsworth as the too pretty to be smart secretary was quite funny kristen wiig melissa mccarthy and even kate mckinnon who i have never really found funny all did amazing jobs    im not one to talk the outside politics of movies and will not be on this one either     is the new film as good as the originals no is it a good film and fun to watch yes maybe the sequel will have better writing that will establish the characters as individuals ill cross that bridge when i get there     so watch the movie you just might enjoy it
Sep 23 2016,positive,better than the original roared laughing
Sep 23 2016,negative,there was so much wasted opportunity in this film the pacing of the movie feels just right actors were performing to their best but the script is a mess the jokes are lame and not funny i would like to see what else they can do if there is a next movie the gadgets are cool
Sep 22 2016,positive,for all the sexist people that hate this movie screw u this movie was hilarious the movie had some scary parts in it but  its mostly about the jokes
Sep 22 2016,positive,i guess just for a one time movies just some  laugh here and there with some hints of a throwback from the original
Sep 22 2016,negative,occassional funny but mostly quite dull
Sep 22 2016,positive,i dont understand why everyone was so whiny about it this wasnt bad at all has a casper the friendly ghost vibe just because its more of a comedy movie with ghosts instead of a ghost movie with comedy but i liked it kate mckinnons character is by far the best  but that sandwich throw back at the end got me good i laughed for quite a while on that one
Sep 22 2016,negative,neither funny nor creepy
Sep 22 2016,positive,it was totally worth the watch despite all the hate it received the things people were miffed about last only moments in the movie and for the things people put up with in other movies i dont see why this got such a bad wrap the only reason i didnt give it a five star was because the beginning was a little awkward but all and all i enjoyed the film and will likely watch it again
Sep 22 2016,positive,wiig mckinnon leslie jones i hemsworth sunt foarte ok aciunea e uor tâmp mccarthy trage tot în jos needs a little more banter
Sep 22 2016,neutral,total waste of an amazing cast
Sep 22 2016,negative,not funny  not scary not memorable  major disappointment
Sep 21 2016,negative,wish i could get back my two hours spent watching this  movie lacked any of the charm that made the original so good
Sep 21 2016,positive,absolutely loved it
Sep 21 2016,neutral,given the negative controversy surrounding the reboot of ghostbusters 2016 i was  quite interested to see the film and make my own conclusions about what if anything was wrong with the film my opinion is more or less consistent with the negative reaction though my reasons are somewhat different i did not laugh out loud once during 116 minute run time of the film the script by paul feig and katie dippold is mediocre it does leslie jones zero favors with the almost random way her character becomes part of the group she basically quits her job and decides she is a ghostbuster so her reactions to all the weird stuff  seems off the simple way ernie hudson was incorporated into the original ghostbusters they hired him would have worked fine for jones comedic style the antagonist writing and acting is truly awful i dont even know the actors name i dont understand why dan aykroyd was not given a crack at this script im also sure if harold ramis were still alive his contribution would have righted the ship before anything was filmed contrary to the positive reviews i thought a big problem was the casting of kate mckinnon whom i love on snl turning it up to eleven for a 3minute snl sketch is fine but mckinnon doesnt seem to understand nor was directed that you can and should dial it back say to a 7 or 8 for a 2hour film in the process she tends to step all over mccarthy and wiigs performances which is the only thing keeping the film afloat especially mccarthy mccarthy and wiig do enough to keep me amused if not laughing out loud in fact mckinnons attempts at chewing the scenery keeps pushing the more talented wiig into the role of straight man so when she diverts from that role re warning the mayor scene her performance feels off the cameos range in quality some work fine aykroyd potts hudson one is ok weaver but the most important one murray falls oddly flat one is totally unnecessary timberlake overall the reboot of ghosterbusters is disappointing because with this cast it should have been awesome its not marks grade c
Sep 21 2016,negative,movie felt like a poor reboot of the series i would have rather seen a canon based continuation female cast or not
Sep 21 2016,positive,funny great date night fun indeed must watch
Sep 20 2016,positive,i dont understand why this movie received so much negativity i loved everything about it
Sep 20 2016,negative,i gave this movie as honest of a chance that i could just couldnt do it was done with it  about 3040 mins in just terrible forced comedy doesnt flow doesnt work
Sep 20 2016,negative,horribly forced one liners utterly cliche comedy attempts one unexpected funny line at end of movie before credits
Sep 20 2016,positive,i enjoyed it  the story wuz good
Sep 19 2016,positive,oh my gosh i wanted to hate it but i couldnt so so so funny i got a headache from laughing great movie will buy
Sep 19 2016,negative,im not going to talk in comparisons to the original because im not a huge fan of that film and went into this one with an open mind hoping to enjoy it on its own merits from the first frame until the final frame of this film they were trying for laughs whether it was dialogue or physical comedy it was constant bombardment of jokes there was almost a sense of desperation at times with how they tried to get those laughs they couldnt even set up the first scene with a solid horror atmosphere because zach woods had to throw in really lame jokes and mug for the camera there is nothing scary in the movie because they make light of everything at one point i wondered if the makers of the movie had any comprehension at all of what makes people laugh because they thought merely showing actors from the original movie in cameo was comedy gold  the whole movie seemed to take a breath after you saw their faces as if the theater was roaring from applause or laughter or something  how is this entertainment  im not watching a flipping talk show where im supposed to applaud when the star comes out on stage at least give them something funny to say  but they were given terribly bland lines in alltoobrief cameo appearances im just going to say it aside from a few mild chuckles this film utterly failed at eliciting any genuine belly laughs from me i think some of the actors in this film are ridiculously funny people who have great comedic timing and yet they are given lackluster material to deal with    i was pleased that melissa mccarthy got to be a likable character in this film because thats when she excels her unlikable roles in films like the boss or identity thief are always a disaster  she wasnt doing much that was new here though so people who dont like her shtick will still be annoyed with her in this movie kristen wiig was boring and didnt add much of anything to the film to be fair though she was playing the straight woman for most of the movie so i didnt have any issue with her performance as for kate mckinnon ive never seen her on snl before but i wonder if she spent all her time there playing a conehead or some other type of alien because she certainly didnt seem human she is so overthetop at every moment that it was like the movie starred 3 women and a spider monkey  this kind of offthewall performance is either going to be a home run or a complete failure for audiences  for me it was the latter thank goodness for leslie jones providing a great grounding influence to the cast her character was the streetwise sassy girl and it fit perfectly the other great casting was chris hemsworth as the moronic but attractive secretary i didnt particularly love how illogically dumb he was there are infants who are just learning to talk that arent as clueless as this guy but he certainly went for it in his performance and had a good time most of the limited chuckles i had came from jones and hemsworth    now i can take a lessthanhilarious comedy with one odd performance and still enjoy myself if the scriptstory is solid sadly for ghostbusters the script is its biggest shortcoming there are so many beats of this movie where i just stared at the screen dumbfounded because the movie made utterly no sense like the moment that a ghost can control an entire platoon and stop them in their tracks but somehow the ghostbusters can run around unchecked  then there are scenes where kate mckinnon goes on babbling fake scientific jargon that makes no sense and does it for no real reason  dont you just love when one scientist explains to another scientist something they both should already understand  guess what screenwriters we dont care how a proton pack works lets just see it in action  and by in action i mean in the field not in a back alley where we watch a poorly executed looney tunes sketch  even when the script does make sense its pretty lazy particularly in the climax    spoilers this is one more in a long line of summer blockbusters that have a final scene which includes a big hole in the middle of new york that is spewing out death and destruction   yes its the avengers again for the 15th time  but just emulating the climax of the avengers isnt enough we have to try and make these ladies like a super hero team  so each ghostbuster gets their own custom ghostfighting gadget or unique power so they can take on the ghosts in their own special way  and then theres the predictable ending where one of the team has to jump into the portal potentially sacrificing themselves only to be pulled back to safety just in time  then after the predictability it gets back to the nonsensical story  how does their hair turn white and why end spoilers    now i mentioned at the outset that i wasnt going to compare this movie to the original which is what we all should be able to do  well it would have been a lot easier if this movie didnt devote so much time to reminding me of that movie  im not just talking about the lame parade of cameos either  this movie quotes lines from the original references ray parker jrs song more than once and has an endcredits scene that teases even more  its to the point where they literally start fighting the classic logo  thats how far this movie goes to try and prove it can go toetotoe with a beloved classic  ill admit that some people will be able to shut off the critical portion of their brains and that will help with enjoyment of ghostbusters  its also worth noting that sense of humor is an extremely subjective thing  therefore while most of the comedy was painfully bad for me i could see some people laughing quite a lot  some people will even enjoy mckinnons insanity  it was not a success for me though  i didnt hate the film it certainly wasnt the worst movie of the summer which i think the internet wanted you to believe beforehand  i just hoped for more laughs more scares more originality more something  sadly the movie didnt deliver that for me at all
Sep 19 2016,neutral,ghostbusters is led by four very funny ladies supported by a surprisingly funny chris hemsworth only to be trod underfoot by a storm of noisy special effects
Sep 19 2016,positive,if you are a die hard ghostbusters fan then you will love this movie
Sep 18 2016,positive,love the cast and the movie
Sep 18 2016,positive,well this was amazing i wasnt sure what to expect when going to see this but i thought it was hilarious i never actually saw the originals but was still concerned for this film after what i had been hearing from others but through it was funny throughout with a great cast
Sep 17 2016,positive,best movie ive seen in years laughed and laughed it was like being a kid all over again
Sep 17 2016,positive,worth a watch some humorous turns kate steals show like melissa did in bridesmaids

Sep 17 2016,positive,it was hilarious and i enjoyed the few jumpscares
Sep 16 2016,positive,this movie was entertaining and it was funny it was not the original ghostbusters and was never meant to be
Sep 16 2016,positive,really good very funny i liked it just as much as i loved the originals lovey cast i hope kate mckinnon rips my gay little heart out
Sep 16 2016,positive,wasnt as bad as people said it was its watchable
Sep 16 2016,negative,worst thing anyone could have done because they had the original people but did little with them
Sep 16 2016,positive,this movie was so so wonderful with such an incredible cast they all have such amazing chemistry together and the movie has such a great mix of spook and comedy leslie jones plays an incredibly relatable and humorous patty and she brings together both the scientific backgrounds of her fellow ghostbusters and the history of new york this movie far exceeded my hopes for it and i hope theyll begin work on a sequel soon
Sep 16 2016,positive,this movie finally opened up here in japan and wow it was amazing i honestly wasnt expecting it to be that great but i found myself looking forward to each scene it had a great mix of laughs and moments that made you jump the casting was spot on and everyone was delightful i want 10 more of these
Sep 15 2016,positive,ive never seen any ghostbuster movie this was good though and funny
Sep 15 2016,positive,i watched this and the original backtoback if you dont think this one doesnt hold up comedywise you are blinded by nostalgia andor other factors
Sep 14 2016,negative,got better as it went along and ended strongly a bit of vulgar humour at the start which felt contrived and i really didnt warm to several of the characters
Sep 14 2016,negative,i tried to have an open mind while watching this movie but its so corny and annoying that i just couldnt stand watching it luckily we still have the original ghostbusters from 1984 to go back to
Sep 14 2016,negative,road warrior was franchise was taken over by a female lead miss strong max  but it least that was a well made movie this is junk
Sep 14 2016,negative,some solid performances that manage to wrestle a chuckle out of me every ten minutes or so but on a writingdirectingediting level easily one of the laziest movies ive seen in ages kate mckinnon deserves so much better
Sep 13 2016,positive,these types of films arent meant to be compared stop comparing them to the originals on its own this film isnt brilliant or terrible its a good film with a fun story its ghostbusters in the end thats what it is ghostbusters through and through
Sep 13 2016,positive,cool movie they went a little overbord with the cgi but loved all the cameos from the original cast very nice touch
Sep 13 2016,positive,its very difficult from the 1980 male version  its good to watch all of the past make a cameo and as well different types of ghost
Sep 13 2016,negative,this  is stupid the ghostbusters replaced by girl that is dumb
Sep 12 2016,negative,typical cool crowd giving the cool crowd high ratings this movie was dumb definitely did not live up to the hype or its predecessor the visuals werent even any good  how do you screw that up anymore
Sep 12 2016,negative,shite i left b4 the end
Sep 12 2016,positive,loved it  i just saw the poster and not the trailer but was hilarious  love all of the characters and the action i especially like the boss and the climax fighting scene was just awesome
Sep 12 2016,negative,its a real shame that they made this movie bad very very bad
Sep 11 2016,negative,its just not funny and its boring
Sep 11 2016,positive,how to reboot a franchisekate steals the show
Sep 11 2016,positive,not as good as the original film but what can be really but leagues better than ghostbusters 2 it seems like it has been edited all to hell but it still is fun also the cast is great you can do a lot worse than this ex b v s
Sep 11 2016,negative,just more rehashed garbage they seem like female clones of the original ghostbusters and its pretty darn cheesy i think a lot of people are too politically correct to be truthful about how bad this movie is it comes off as a complete feminist movement ploy i might enjoy this movie if the actors didnt portray as the female version of the original or they had at least one male ghost buster in the mix other than  a bosley figure to a group of unattractive charlies angels
Sep 10 2016,positive,the most underrated film of 2016 very funny and good comedic cast
Sep 10 2016,neutral,when youre hunting ghosts you dont bicker or get snotty with your peers you play along and cooperate
Sep 10 2016,negative,the latest reboot to hit the screens ghostbusters had some big shoes to fill and unfortunately missed the mark on so many levels     instead of focusing on the story they really let us down and turned the movie into a pc fuelled jab fest that really took things to far satire without the satire    the actors are all very talented in their own right however they have been let down by the writers in this case kristen wiigs character within the fist 3 mins of the film has a conversation with the dean of the university about her attire leslie jones is a disgusting and offensive stereotype of an african american woman chris hemsworth is well stupid blond bimbo receptionist that they keep around only because he is pretty perceived role reversal     this satirical way of looking at role reversal i seen through the film the ladies taking on the stereotypical male role as what the creators deem the world to be like     i am sad to say that this movie is sad to watch and very cringeworthy in several places with the main villain a man having to be shot in the crotch to be defeated     there are lines and situations through the film that if the genders where reversed there would be public outcry saying that it is degrading to woman the stereotypes that they have tried to swap roles on have not existed since the last ghostbusters was around     while trying to be progressive and on point this movie flops in all the places that we would hope to see true progression     i am sure that i am going to be called all sorts of names for saying that i do not like this film and think that it is pc gone too far i hope that the next movie actually focuses on the story of ghostbusting and leave the gender politics at the door and it will be a much better movie     sony has already committed to making the sequal so i hope they learn
Sep 10 2016,negative,really nothing i have to say about this just terrible awful every character every joke every scene a disgrace
Sep 10 2016,positive,ignore the idiotic hate spreaders this is entertaining funny and worth watching
Sep 9 2016,positive,enjoyed the remake  the movie humor was hit  miss but no worse than the original
Sep 9 2016,positive,another masterful blend brought to you by a team of paul feig melissa mccarthy and kristen wiig   i will admit at first i was a little reticent about a reboot of my beloved ghostbusters particularly when i learned this was a project put together in lieu of a ghostbusters iii following the passing of harold ramis but the masterful combination of feig mccarthy wiig jones mckinnon and hemsworth had a perfect combination of camaraderie and comedy  i love feigs storytelling and the performances by the actors was well above the current level of film performances  add a perfect blend of cameos from the surviving members of the original cast with the lone exception of the nowretired rick moranis include the legacy of the aforementioned harold ramis son daniel has a cameo and shake vigorously  does the ending look like it was lifted from pacific rim sure but that was forgivable because i loved pacific rim  i look forward to a strong sophomore performance from these ghostbusters  side note of all the cameos i bellylaughed loudest at the appearance of ernie hudson
Sep 9 2016,positive,alright movie elevated by good casting kate mckinnon kills
Sep 9 2016,positive,plot average  acting good including well timed and delivered comedy  sfx very good  sound track above average
Sep 8 2016,positive,as far as supernatural comedies go its one of the best great cast great jokes and spectacularly spoton cameos i really enjoyed the new ghostbusters movie laughed a lot huge step towards gender equality in film i felt moved by the portrayal of a badass team of women in a scifi movie much like the force awakens this film offered a glimpse into a future where women have greater opportunities to be strong rolemodels playing iconic film heroes without being sexually objectified however similarly to tfa the new ghostbusters suffers from a lack of diversity the biggest problem was that leslie jones character should have had an academic background like the others two scientists and an engineer but she still comes across as an intelligent knowledgeable character and lj is really great in the role as for the writing and plot i thought it was just the right blend of spooky hilarious and smart a great start towards correcting the underrepresentation of women in lead roles and ensemble casts but itd be great to see more diversity ethnic lgbtq and differentlyabled persons in the sequel
Sep 8 2016,positive,i loved this movie it was funny just as it was advertised and i dont see what was soo based about it
Sep 8 2016,negative,this film spit on the franchise and how dare bill murray do this but never do 3rd film while ramis was alive damn you bill 
Sep 8 2016,positive,youll never appease butthurt neckbeards  i enjoyed it
Sep 8 2016,positive,a lot of fun i grew up with the original and hearing those proton packs chargeup again brought me back and felt so good these ladies kicked ass and all the new gadgets had me running to the toy store just like the good ol days there were a few times i felt it was a little too goofy in spots but the kids will love that the only thing i didnt care for was how dumbdown chris hemsworths character was it was a bit much but it was very well done i will be buying it once it goes to dvd and its a welcome edition to my beloved ghostbusters collection
Sep 7 2016,positive,a fun remake of the original movie kate mckinnons character definitely steals the show shes hilarious some fun connections to the original movie like cameos from bill murray and dan aykroyd plus a peak at how the ghostbusters logo was conceived bring back the nostalgia of the 80s to those of use that grew up when the first movie came out
Sep 7 2016,positive,patty character was the best although i hate writers stereotypical character
Sep 7 2016,positive,its kinda sad because this film got way more attention than it deserves first off i love the original its one of the films that defines my childhood that being said i found the reboot to be enjoyable its not a copy of the original and kinda of makes its own way it also takes some typical gender issues in films and switches them around just give it a chance and it might surprise you its not perfect not all the jokes land and the finale was a tad to lose to the original but overall i enjoyed myself
Sep 7 2016,positive,overlooking that the reboot is disrespectful to the original franchise by completely ignoring the original movies and rewriting an already winning team chemistry ghostbusters fails to fill the franchise shoes    thats not to say its all bad  it was pretty entertaining  i loved the art direction props and the special effects they felt very fitting  i liked most of the jokes  mccarthy and hemsworth steal a lot of the spotlight  however leslie jones comes off as mostly obnoxious      unfortunately its not one of mccarthy or feigs funniest film perhaps due to the pg13 restriction overall i felt unimpressed by the amount of laughable moments based on the size of comedic talent in the cast  i also felt the villain was underdeveloped and unclear
Sep 7 2016,negative,biggest pile of wince inducing sexist garbage i ever saw in my life worst 40 minutes of my life
Sep 7 2016,negative,thin storyline with similarities to the original 1984 movie almost everything in this movie is just a badly distilled version of the original its far from epicalso the cgi ghosts look awful ecto looks awful proton packs and equipment is more steampunk looking stuff etc etc this whole movie was a bad idea from the beginning since the original is near perfection actors dont seem to have any chemistry with each other and the jokes are lame or too farfetched
Sep 6 2016,positive,not too bad considering it was a follow up  melissa mccarthy is always great  the humor was good it had some plausibility and then went out to lunch with its ghosts etc probably where it lost some of the credits  the actress who did patty was good  the other two were neutral  not sure it was their acting as much as their characters  i would not recommend it as much as other shows nor would i watch this again
Sep 6 2016,negative,one of the worst movies ive seen the jokes are cringey and the actors are stupid at there role just an awful excuse of a movie
Sep 6 2016,positive,some of the jokes they tried a little  to hard with but it was ok
Sep 6 2016,positive,i will say it is not as good as the original but it is not that bad it js a fun film  with a lot of humor i think the end was way to over the top and the whole portal thing was a bit cliche but besides that its a fun film you can enjoy
Sep 6 2016,negative,so boring tryed to watch at drive left after 20 min
Sep 6 2016,positive,really enjoyed it best film ive seen in ages
Sep 5 2016,positive,absolute hoot dont listen to the upset fanboys
Sep 5 2016,positive,this movie was just as good as the original ghostbusters plus all the original cast had cameos i dont understand the hate this film was a blast
Sep 5 2016,negative,what the hell is this this movie is a forgettable hollywood remake that only exists because it has an all female cast
Sep 5 2016,negative,hey do you like the original ghostbusters but wanted to see what it would be like without comedy and a likable cast  do you like tired old stereotypes duct taped together with no onscreen charisma  do you like calling people who disagree with you about a movie racist or misogynist  then this is your citizen kane
Sep 5 2016,positive,saw it and thought it was hilarious of course kristen and melissa are funny but i was also impressed by leslie and kate good story all on its own
Sep 5 2016,positive,loved it bright fresh and funny even better the second time around
Sep 5 2016,positive,might as well watch the original
Sep 5 2016,positive,men are childish spiteful idiots  that being said im sorry to report that thor is the best part of the film  id like a little more bite from the two leads and a little better writing for jones but overall it was solid oh and im in love with kate mckinnon
Sep 5 2016,negative,didnt laugh once  special effects were bland  wish i could have given this 110th of a star rating
Sep 4 2016,positive,great film loved the cameos from the original cast the ladies were amazing and chris hemsworth was hysterical
Sep 4 2016,positive,this was a funny cast and a funny movie it was filled with lots of nostalgia it laughing and dancing it my seat i can not really understand the 1 stars defiantly worth seeing
Sep 4 2016,neutral,nap worthy remake  
Sep 4 2016,positive,dont know why people have this movie crap it is different from the original and the characters are so funny
Sep 4 2016,positive,i liked that this movie wasnt just a retelling of the 1st movies they actually came up with a different story very entertaining
Sep 4 2016,negative,so boring the screenplay is completely dull poor comedy just disappointed with the hole thing
Sep 4 2016,negative,the original cast couldnt look unhappier making cameo appearances in this stinker of a remake  ill feel their pain
Sep 4 2016,negative,original was much better
Sep 4 2016,negative,2 stars gonna be fair here all the men in this movie were considered bumbling idiots the queef joke lets see the ending a dick shot joke a spot that could have been one thing but then they dropped it in the credits but i did laugh a few timesi dont hate it but dont like it if you enjoy it hey great if u didnt its ok too everyone has that right to  opnion no right or wrong review here id say atleast rent this give it a chance u might be surprised causes honestly i wanted to hate this but i couldent but it does at times insult the intelegence popcorn flick all the way
Sep 3 2016,neutral,well here is our fresh scored ghostbusters reboot that marginally keeps the original universe within cameos from most of surviving cast  a easter egg of egon the film did not ruin my love for the original or taint my childhood this was however a big miss for sony due to poor marketingconception  overall lack of substance in the finished product thus brings my biggest problem  the inevitable extended cut on bluray hollywood seems to love to milk their consumers of every dime they have in order to see footage we should get day one at the movie theatersome jokes miss their mark and the overall story of this one follows the first movie way too closely to bring anything new to the tablethe four lady busters were all great alongside one another and hope well hear them in an animated entry
Sep 3 2016,positive,not as good as the original ghostbusters but still a lot of fun
Sep 3 2016,negative,the film was incredibly disappointing the humour of the originally out ways the cheap laughs this badly scripted remake has to offer honestly lost interest half way through the film and wished i was watching the bill murry original at home and saved myself the money
Sep 3 2016,positive,the special effects are better than the old ghostbusters movies had as expected but its otherwise a pointless remake mildly entertaining first and only viewing  932016 in theaters
Sep 3 2016,positive,great rollicking fun
Sep 3 2016,positive,the remake of ghostbusters is a well made reincarnation of the beloved original thanks to the superb ensemble cast
Sep 2 2016,positive,this movie clearly wasnt going to win any awards for storytelling but the cast was superb each actor meshed perfectly as a group and provided some moderately entertaining scenes im not going to lie and say it was the biggest pile of shit ever because ultimately that isnt true the asshats on the internet saw their childhood favorite and instantly gave it a terrible review without viewing the final product this film definitely was amazing but no where near the horrors of other movies like the smurfs or foodfight
Sep 2 2016,negative,i felt this rendition of ghostbusters was unique at first the story was pretty interesting with the use of an allfemale main cast and pretty stellar visual effects but then again there were plenty of downsides some of the jokes were not too funny in the sense that they dragged along especially regarding kristen wiig the concept of an allfemale main cast might pander to sjws and feminists sorry but not sorry and that chris hemsworths portrayal of a retarded loser as the secretary was really cringing and despicable this female version of ghostbusters might be considered okay in its own right but will not stand up to the clever humorous standards of the 1984 original that we all loved
Sep 2 2016,negative,ghostbusters as a bunch of bumbling idiots thanks for destroying the legacy
Sep 2 2016,positive,a genuinely outstanding reboot wiig mccarthy mckinnon and jones are an amazingly charismatic ensemble and they handle both the comedy and the action with an ease that gave me so very many gutlaughs and jawdrops mckinnon especially in the final act street fight with her dazzling array of weapons its also really satisfying to find logic in the writing  three decades ago we may have accepted that supernatural events were simply happening but this script gives reasons for the outbreak and with it a more grounded and less deific primary antagonist the pace lagged a little in places but this along with what sounded like a rap remix of the classic theme song as well as a very unnecessary appearance by an overrated metal singer are minor quibbles cameos by the original cast were highly charming especially the ramis tribute early on and its also hilarious to see hemsworth handling a comedic role
Sep 2 2016,positive,had to watch it a couple times before i liked it or found the comedy
Sep 1 2016,positive,just see it for kate mckinnon and the schumacheresque color scheme
Sep 1 2016,positive,it was funny and all the actors were great these old white men need to chill lol
Sep 1 2016,negative,fcking terrible if i wanted to get liberal social justice bullshit thrown in my face i wouldve stayed home and turned on cnn
Sep 1 2016,negative,as a drama this was weak as a scifi film this was boring as a comedy this was just not funny if it isnt broke dont fix it
Sep 1 2016,negative,i love these actresses but hated this movie the original was a thousand times better and actually had thought put into it there was nothing scary in this movie at alli was bored to be totally honest
Sep 1 2016,positive,a great reboot and highly recommended the original was the very first film i saw at the cinema as a child and i have a massive fondness for this franchise i truly think this reboot was well done and with the right cast a laugh a minute the only down side was all the haters giving it a bad time without actually going to see it
Sep 1 2016,negative,sorry not trying to be sexiest but bottom line i grew up to 4 male main actors in the ghost busters where even the cartoon was the same so i dont see how you can even think about using females for the role im not saying its a bad movie but not something i am very interested in watching a 2nd time due to what i remember from the old ones that made my childhood
Sep 1 2016,negative,ha some dumb humor  originalwas subtle and funnier  better one liners liked holtsman though  patty was over he top in her humor  slapping and shouting  over the topim a few places and the secretary by chris hemsworth is it funny just weak  why is thst funny jeneane melnetz was sassy in the original 
Sep 1 2016,positive,haha i like kristen wiig she is great in that movie but overall it is a forgettable movie sadly
Aug 31 2016,negative,i was superexcited at the prospect of the revival of a childhood relic  the allwoman cast but the movie nonetheless managed to turn every character  regardless of gender  into a onesided stereotype  combined with some serious plot holes why didnt they just do this very obvious thing instead complete lack of common sense to a situation first response to a mysterious object flashing lights  making noise in a transit system is get closer to it and science fiction that demands far too much suspension of belief in real science than i could afford i can give some but at least give it a realisticfantasy shot i entered expecting so much more than it delivered  i was hoping that a movie with the hype of smashing stereotypes wouldve done better not to itself give into them
Aug 31 2016,negative,im not sexist but the film is shit
Aug 31 2016,positive,far better than expected
Aug 31 2016,positive,is it as good as the original no did it make me laugh alot and enjoy all the characters and performances yes
Aug 31 2016,positive,funny if predictable
Aug 31 2016,negative,this summer of dull movies culminating in effectladen battles has been numbing so i pretty much snoozed through ghostbusters and its climactic tussle of burning exploding goospewing ghouls misused comic actresses painful cameos from original cast and worst of all not funny
Aug 31 2016,negative,notwithstanding the mouthbreathing idiocy on either side of the debate over this movie i didnt expect this to be any good  contrary to a lot of loud and shrill voices out there it had nothing whatsoever to do with the sex of the main cast members something about the humor shown in the trailers rubbed me the wrong way and frankly i thought the special effects looked horrendous the kind of sickeningly oversaturated neon bloated inyourface cartoonish crap that gets shoved in our faces in every liveaction disney and scoobydoo film these days  still my mother wanted to see this and she took me to suicide squad as a late birthday present two days ago so i tried to put aside my low expectations and see this film without judgment  this movie still managed to disappoint me    you know how in the original film the actors just sort of played themselves with different names and professions  remember how they all just sort of played off each other with their quick wits and dry humor and they all had such great chemistry because they were able to just behave naturally  well in this reboot i think the humor is best exemplified by the catoutofthebag sketch near the beginning of the film  the humor in this scene is awkward and unnatural and comes across as desperate to be liked  furthermore its just plain stupid  the dry wit of the original is replaced by pathetically forced attempts at attitude and poor slapstick that all left me facepalming rather than enjoying the movie    now im not one of these mens rights shitheads who sees a radical feminist agenda in any media that portrays women in a powerful role but the arguments that this movie is fundamentally manhating are a bit more difficult to argue considering the secretary played by chris hemsworth  now dumb characters in a movie can work as long as the stupidity is believable and looks natural but unnatural is going to be the common theme for this movies attempt at comedy  i cannot for the life of me think of any reason why chris hemsworth should be this frigging stupid  the guy acts like he functions at a level just barely above a drooling vegetable  theres no good reason for it and again its just annoying rather than amusing    ive already ranted about the special effects at the beginning of this review and they are absolutely god awful so ill just end this with what i think is the biggest stinker of this turd sandwich the villain  for all of its comedic tone the original ghostbusters had an actual threat  whether you consider the main bad guy to be either gozer or ivo szandor there was a genuine sense of cosmic menace in the form of an ancient malevolent god called down to end the world by a psychopathic genius cultist the kind of thing lovecraft used to love writing  here the main antagonist issome ponce who works as a janitor at a hotel  thats it  some twerp who read one of the characters books and decided to end the world because people were meanies to him      the professional critics are predictably full of shit when this ass gets a certified fresh rating while suicide squad gets panned
Aug 31 2016,negative,this was just crap  loved the idea  hated the execution
Aug 31 2016,negative,at the end of the day the talented cast is wasted on a story that doesnt seem to know what it wants to be where it wants to go or how it wants to treat its characters seriously
Aug 31 2016,negative,how is it possible to make such a boring film with such a great cast  story kate mckinnon is the chief reason to stick with this
Aug 31 2016,positive,nothing fancy its fun overall the cast is the best part
Aug 31 2016,negative,almost a good remake spoilt by an insulting and dumb script
Aug 31 2016,positive,i liked the movie im a fan of the first ghostbusters movie the second one is shiit but this 2016 reboot is nice the characters have more depth then the original and theres no uncomfortable degrading jokes sure i missed the subtle effects from the first movie but overall its an entertaning comedy that will make kids today happy and want to go on ghost adventures just like i did when i was a kid a movie doesnt have to be amazing to be good and i was thrilled to see a movie i can show my nieces and nephews without having to explain the importance of consent
Aug 31 2016,positive,not bad for a reboot great fx and some engaging action scenes  but especially funny and the characters are not rip offs of the original but new people each of which bring something funny to the table in this comedy
Aug 30 2016,positive,it was funny and cute the next day i couldnt remember the names of the characters
Aug 30 2016,positive,smart brilliant movie soooooooooo fun
Aug 30 2016,negative,lamelong and boringabout 90 minutes to long
Aug 30 2016,neutral,not bad but i fell asleep somewhere in the middle so ill have to go see it again
Aug 30 2016,negative,who you gonna call not the ghostbusters reboot
Aug 30 2016,negative,forgettable in every respect and lacking any laughs scares or fun ghostbusters answer the call is the worst reboot of all time and is not worth the price of a single ticket or any of the internet rage you throw at it
Aug 29 2016,negative,so bad  bad acting bad humor bad special effects very disappointing
Aug 29 2016,negative,73 from critics simply proves that critics are not credible anymore lying that this movie is good pretending that it isnt a complete dumpster fire i dont trust any of these critics
Aug 29 2016,negative,it is not worth seeing if it were free and you had a couple hours to kill i would have rather watched paint dry
Aug 29 2016,neutral,again the movie stars a series of snl veterans mccarthy and wiig have great chemistry together as usual but they are not as funny as they are in other projects in fact they seemed to come off a bit predictable and bland wiig especially mccarthy was able to make me laugh in a couple of spots but most of the movies jokes kept coming up short the funniest person in the whole movie is leslie jones this woman was fun to watch and really raised the quality of the film for me  as for the cgi im actually fine with it its not as good as it is in other movies but it seems appropriate for a comical movie like this mixing the styles of scoobydoo and the haunted mansion it seemed like these ghosts were paying homage to the ghosts from the real ghostbusters cartoon show this is exactly what i always felt the ghosts of ghostbusters were like comical cartoonishlike creatures  even the action is a little better besides the classic proton packs these ghostbusters have a whole slew of creative new gadgets that force them into physical action and getting their hands dirty while the action in the original ghostbusters was fun and visually pleasing most of it just had the cast standing around shooting at ghosts there wasnt much physicality  so is the movie worthy of all this criticism and hate i dont think so of course its not as good as the original but i wouldnt mind watching it again one day basically the only reason fans are upset by this movie is because of the fact that it pretty much cuts off all ties with the first two movies maybe if the filmmakers tried to attach this film more with the original by having the old ghostbusters pass the torch to the next generation hard core fans would be more accepting of it
Aug 29 2016,negative,saw it yesterday and it was just like the trailer meh it wasnt awful but it wasnt nearly as good as all the critics keep saying it was mediocre at best
Aug 29 2016,negative,awful awful film its internal logic was inconsistent and the jokes fell flat id rather donate bone marrow than watch this again
Aug 28 2016,positive,not remotely as bad as it couldve been it did made laugh and felt chills during the intro loved the mythology the first two acts were really good the final one is just ok  giving 5 stars to compensate the score
Aug 28 2016,positive,while certainly not better than the original it is indeed fun and haters should get out more and watch it  mckinnons holtzmann steals the show
Aug 28 2016,positive,warningmay contain spoilers  tomatometer40    not even close to the first filmthis reboot wasnt that bad but it wasnt great eitherthere are a lot of moments when theyre trying to be funny but they just cant seem to do ita lot of the story didnt make sense either
Aug 28 2016,negative,nowhere near as good as the original watchable garbage at best and i definitely wouldnt want to watch this version again
Aug 28 2016,positive,i enjoyed the reboot of ghostbusters it was fun to recall seeing the original 30 years  ago my wife and i had seen it in the theatre shortly before i departed for studies in austria where i saw it in german the audience in the us laughed uproariously when the staypuft marshmallow man emerged as the ghostbusters nemesis a unique mix of pathos and humor the austrian audience was dumbfounded at the translation mein liebster marshmallowman as i recall there was no such moment for me in the 2016 version but i did exclaim and jump in my seat as the first ghost in the movie spewed 3d projectile slime into my lap there were a few too many i got this and lets do this proclamations script anyone but i soon warmed to this allfemale ghost busting team and their loony secretary kevin lacking were the true scary moments provided by sigourney weaver in the original to stand in contrast to the campy humor but i did enjoy the natural and supernatural cameos from the old cast a good feelgood night out at the movies with a heapin helping of nostalgia for those of us old enough to have lived the release of the original recommended
Aug 28 2016,neutral,a by the numbers remake which adds very little to the original  the cast tries their best but the script isnt very funny or creative  the special effects are great and the ending is energetic  just wish they couldve done more than retread already familiar ground
Aug 28 2016,negative,this movie did not ruin my childhood but it did make for a disappointing afternoon its an uninspired corporate remake in an age of corporate remakes    one thing i will give credit for the trailer did not do leslie jones justice she is one of very few characters in the movie that isnt one note and flat her character felt like a person contrast this to kate mckinnons character where it felt like her entire shtick was the director saying okay do something random in every scene  its okay to be obnoxious just be as random as possible the villain was weak and the special effects felt like a scooby doo movie
Aug 28 2016,negative,unbelievable how bad that was overly forced humor really terrible acting  had to leave the cinema
Aug 28 2016,neutral,not too bad but not very funny special effects at the end quite good
Aug 27 2016,negative,certainly some funny parts overall though the comedy seemed forced worse though was the constant need the film seemed to have to tie in this movie to the past movies i am a huge fan of the original ghostbusters and while i love the originals i was interested to see a new take had they done so i think this cast and production team couldve made a pretty good film instead they simply straddled between old and new never truly developing much of a plot nor filling that void with comedy for this new take
Aug 27 2016,positive,funny i love that they were girls instead of boys show that girls can do anything to
Aug 27 2016,positive,if you can forget the fact that there was a far superior movie of the same name in 1984 theres actually a lot to enjoy with this movie unfortuanatly the movie itself wont let you forget which is probably its greatest misstep
Aug 27 2016,positive,i thought it was fun
Aug 27 2016,positive,its so different then the old ones
Aug 27 2016,negative,movie was slow dialogue and acting weak  while special effects were good they were not good enough to carry the movie  i would not recommend seeing it
Aug 27 2016,negative,what a piece of garbage it has very little originality villains with unknown motivations endless stereotypes makes males look like total idiots which is incredibly insulting and its formula is following an actually ok joke with an extremely unfunny joke its sonys best example of a lazy loweffort cashin screw you sony
Aug 27 2016,positive,i dont know what peoples problem is this is a great movie
Aug 27 2016,positive,not as bad as i thought it might be seeing bunch of fat chicks doing the ghost bangers
Aug 27 2016,positive,so funny lots of action i think its the best movie ive ever seen
Aug 26 2016,negative,i saw this had a 73 rating  better than the 72 that forrest gump has so i was really excited to see a movie that was better than forrest gump    the first joke that came out was a queef joke the tone of the movie was set as a vaginal fart    and it never really took off from there each character has 1 dimension and barely manages to even fill that dimension the chemistry between any character and any other character in this 73 masterpiece is about 120     it feels like a storyboard come to life as if 30 people all spitballed ideas for what would look cool or what would be hilarious and then they slapped it all together and hoped it would make sense    it does not make sense    it felt like watching the saturday morning wb cartoons as a kid where 1 minute pepe le pew is chasing a cat and the next bugs bunny is taking the piss out of elmer fudd there was no story and no sense just a bunch of 2 minutes animations the only difference being that clever writing and comedy went into the wb shorts    sadly the cinema i saw this at would not issue a refund     dont see it it falls flat on every front the highlight is the cgi but its so overused that just like too much cake you get sick of it and end up rushing to the toilet
Aug 26 2016,positive,its one of the best remakes ever seriously its funny n fresh i loved it
Aug 26 2016,positive,very funny and unwaveringly fun the new ghostbusters suffered from a bad marketing campaign but make no mistake the four leads here do a fantastic job with the humour and the characters the villain is very weak and the direction is mediocre but overall this movie definitely comes highly recommended
Aug 26 2016,positive,only because it surpasses the expectations you have once the movie starts i think they did a great job and i really enjoy the cameos and easter eggs
Aug 26 2016,negative,terrible pile of sjw trash doesnt even try to remain faithful to the original
Aug 26 2016,negative,entertaining but very silly couple funny items but mainly weak and a far cry from the original
Aug 26 2016,positive,hilarious and fun to watch
Aug 26 2016,positive,funny  except for one hollywood obligatory action scene that didnt make much sense this movie held together nicely and had me laughing or cheering a good deal of the time  the creepy factor is higher in this movie than the original imo
Aug 26 2016,positive,cool movie great remake to a great movie
Aug 26 2016,positive,denise jones should have left her racial comment out of this movie poor taste
Aug 26 2016,negative,a boring unfunny soulless remake that had me wishing it would be better scene after scene
Aug 26 2016,negative,while the concept may have seemed promising the final product is a clumsy mess of poor writing shoddy cinematography and lackluster pacing that a cinematic classic like the 1984 ghostbusters doesnt deserve to be associated with
Aug 26 2016,negative,while the concept may have seemed promising the final product is a clumsy mess of poor writing shoddy cinematography and lackluster pacing that a cinematic classic like the 1984 ghostbusters doesnt deserve to be associated with
Aug 26 2016,neutral,one word summation underwhelming
Aug 25 2016,neutral,its really refreshing to watch chris hemsworth in normal form not being a god and all read thor anddd hes really handsome although hes only a receptionist in here and not doing a great job eitherlol a quite funny movie kristin wiig style i like her one of my favorite comedian i like holtzmann too shes so brilliant and crazy she made most of the gadget or all of them
Aug 25 2016,positive,i loved it the cast was flawless and the jokes hit its a good way to lose an hour and a half
Aug 25 2016,positive,the script could have used some work  the talented experienced funny actors should have been allowed a little more improve room but its not boring and some gags land really well a second movie would be better i think but someone will find a way to not make it and give money to adam sandler instead
Aug 25 2016,negative,why hollywood just why 95 of the jokes fall flat and all men in this movie are idiots especially thor in another 30 years  the original will still be watched by the masses but in 30 years this film will long since have been forgotten and thank god
Aug 24 2016,negative,i tried to have an open mind couple of the actresses werent bad  but the script cinematography and special effects were terrible  its like it was created by people who never saw the original and based the movie off like 5 stock photos from the originals  i am so glad to hear this movie lost money
Aug 24 2016,positive,i loved this movie it stands on its own very fresh and the comedy is smart sarcastic  natural similar to the first ones i look forward to the dvd 
Aug 24 2016,negative,terrible movie the jokes felt forced and were simply not funny this was a failed reboot
Aug 24 2016,negative,oh wow finally got a chance to watch this trainwreck its everything i assumed it would be but less
Aug 24 2016,neutral,ghostbusters get way more hate than what it deserves because of the obvious reasons the fans of the originals not wanting new ones to change anything about what made the first ones great but if judged as an individual movie its really not that bad sure it does have some feminism involved in it but its not as bas as everyone thought it would be in my opinion and its not super hilarious but it does have its moments one thing i cant really defend its ridiculous and unrealistic how holtzmann comes up with new gadgets it implies it takes her 5 minutes to come up with them and build them also the giant lazer beam into the sky apocaliptic scenario again its really getting overplayed
Aug 24 2016,positive,as a standalone film its good in comparison to the original its half the movie kate mckinnon outshines the two bigger stars  wiig and mccarthy
Aug 24 2016,positive,its a terrible movie with funny parts haha fun date night
Aug 24 2016,negative,i must assume that its decent tomatameter rating is due to very restrained critiques by feministleaning critics    this is a bad movie
Aug 24 2016,positive,ghostbusters is a perfectly acceptable comedyaction movie but i was hoping it was going to be even better than it is that might have potentially although still probably not shut up all the early critics who wrote this movie off the second it was announced straight up if you go into this expecting it to be as good as the original you will walk out disappointed it feels like it relies a lot more on one liners and quick gags as opposed to building the comedy throughout a whole scene i enjoyed the entire main cast in their roles and thought they had pretty good chemistry together people seem to be pretty mixed on kate mckinnon but i liked her energy even though i can agree that a few of her gags didnt quite land the clear standout is chris hemsworth he is absolutely hilarious as the ghostbusters incredibly stupid secretary and plays probably the best comedy role ive scene in a few years heres hoping that ghostbusters makes enough money to warrant a sequel as itd be interesting to see where paul feig can take the series moving forward
Aug 23 2016,neutral,does nothing to harm or hurt the franchise it just exists but it is disappointing even with the stupid controversy surrounding it which we can all agree on how it started but with no sense of verisimilitude all the comedy comes off as sketch instead of situational and every character is a caricature sure we all love holtzman but not everyone needs to be wildly exaggerated the ghosts designs are neat and the gadgets are quite awesome but nothing really makes it special or even stand out especially since this relies heavily on the original without staying in that universe
Aug 23 2016,positive,funny and entertaining plain and simple
Aug 23 2016,negative,was not what i was expecting at all i dont mind if you change the characters but dont change the story that drastically
Aug 23 2016,positive,im glad it was these funny gals taking a spin at this classic than say an excruciating reboot featuring the seth rogen acting company or even  worse the latest adam sandler netflix eyesore
Aug 23 2016,positive,legitimately the best movie i have seen all year
Aug 23 2016,negative,the all girl cast killed it as in its dead as a franchise  the story was lame the cameos were really bad and it was just forgettable  an hour after watching it i couldnt remember a damn thing about it that stood out
Aug 23 2016,negative,what a loud of utter poo
Aug 23 2016,positive,6310 my review 
Aug 23 2016,positive,no need to compare to the original stillit knows its roots w a fabulous cast enlivening this frivolous yet diverting reboot maybe not in full force but its spirit is there  can be savored believe it or not hemsworth nearly steals all of the laughs from the ladies
Aug 23 2016,negative,horrible just horrible its not even really a movie just a string of stupid skits that are obviously improved basically a backyard movie done by 12 year olds only with a 144m budget
Aug 23 2016,negative,my own personal opinion on this pile of trash is not the casting of women but the bad casting of the female leads such as melissa mccarthy and leslie jones in particular theres nothing misogynic about it as the pc critics are trying to convince us is the case as far as im concerned the casting of these two overrated actresses is what screwed the movie and then throw in hemsworths role just to further the pc effort and you really screwed the pooch on this one i have no problem with women being the main characters in films such as sigourney weaver daisy ridley etc who has proven themselves to be worthy action stars themselves in fact there is a new one on the horizon that i am really looking forward to felicity jones in rogue one a star wars story   but i digress  unfortunately with harold ramis passing away so unexpectedly the decision was to just do a complete reboot instead of continuing with what was left of the original cast and obviously turned out to be a huge mistake in doing so ghostbusters the reboot has its problems mainly from the fans who were anticipating a sequel with the original cast and which ultimately proved to be the deciding factor in the unfavorable and critical response form the fanbase   the critics may like this film for whatever reason though i think it has to do with political correctness than anything but the fans are the ones who decide if the sequel should be made and thankfully this is one film where it looks like there will not be a sequel
Aug 22 2016,negative,waste of money and time didnt even crack a smile
Aug 22 2016,negative,how this got over 10 ill never know  just awful
Aug 22 2016,positive,who ya gonna call ghostbusters 2016  im gonna come right out and say it i liked this movie far more than i expected to    the plot is pretty standard the team comes together to stop someone whos like them but turned to the dark side from ending the world but the overall flow is pretty consistent pacing is ok it does bounce around a bit but keeps its eye on the ball the characters progression is steady but realistic the story arch stays pretty well ontarget  i was consistently entertained    now for the characters themselves abby ray  erin venkman are a great comedy team they really seemed like two longtime friends their chemistry felt genuine  their backforth dialog flowed really well i did laugh quite a bit abby was really likable like a quirky aunt who not only believed you if you said there was something under your bed but would also help you build traps to catch the thing erin was so relatable an outcast who put on a mask of conformity  wore it so long she forgot herself holtzmann egon was totally demented  i fell in love with her in about 5 seconds she was like frankensteins daughter i was never bored by her even when she wasnt doing anything patty winston is still the downtoearth everyperson of the team smart in her own right strong funny shes like the big sister of the group  she really does earn her right to be on the team kevin janineis an idiot the running gag with him is that he seems to have a wire crossed upstairs  that hes just eyecandy but it was ok he never really grated on my nerves  he worked well with the ladies    the villain is sort of sympathetic but unapologetic hes a fellow outcast  i understood where he was coming from he really got a raw deal but as things progressed it was clear there was no going back for him    the cameos were all well placed had nice story flow  were really nice to see even one i wasnt expecting no spoilers    the effects were quite the mixed bag the gb hardware was explained with just enough hardtounderstand tech jargon that it seemed plausible ecto1 looked great but didnt sound quite right maybe in the next film the proton packs were awesome they came about through trialerror which made them feel all the more real  the proton streams looked and sounded like they should 110 the new gadgets were a nice addition  they didnt upstage the classic gear the pke meter  the ghost trap were the only things that fell a bit short they strayed maybe a bit too far from the originals but they served their purpose the ghosts were all cgi which was unfortunate but it didnt kill the movie for me they looked otherworldly there were unique types  they could be fairly scary at times plus there were a ton of practical set pieces  buckets of practical slime    35 stars outve 5 this film didnt ruin my childhood it didnt color my memory of or love of the original franchise  i think it was very respectful of the source material i do recommend seeing as much of the original franchise as possible before seeing this but as far as reboots go it works     yes i still aint afraid of no ghost
Aug 22 2016,positive,very very entertaining
Aug 22 2016,negative,this is insult about original ghostbusters   worst movie ever 
Aug 22 2016,negative,after watching no less than 30004000 movies altogether so far this one is at the very bottom there has to be a few c productions worse than this but not many and hardly a movie that has this coverage and this much polish in terms of having everything it needs at its disposal  fails this bad  this is a poorly written movie  the story concept is bad  the story execution is bad  the lines are bad  the story arcs are very badly implemented  the humor is awful  the characters are very very badly done  the script is awful  this is a poorly directed movie  the acting is bad  the characters are poorly designed  everything creative about this film is very very bad  try and avoid it  watch at your own peril  this is bad film making
Aug 22 2016,negative,its just another dull bland heartless remake that doesnt deserve any of the controversy some jokes landed most didnt and i really didnt like the effects
Aug 22 2016,positive,yo whats w all the hate for this movie i liked it thought it was quite watchable thor playin a tard never forget
Aug 22 2016,positive,i had a glass of wine before i went to see this movie and it still wasnt that funny i feel like they took themselves too seriously i thought the characters were likeable on their own but the story was a bit thin the saving grace was surprisingly chris hemsworth who knew he had such great comic timing think he is working in the wrong genre of film  he should do more comedy
Aug 22 2016,positive,i love the original but i loved this more relevant new full of positive representation and so important oh and hella funny whats not to love 
Aug 22 2016,negative,the level of sexism regarding kevin was very disappointing the producers were so careful to not over sexualise the ladies which was great but then they completely ruined it by the way they portrayed the male secretary and and how the females talked and acted around him
Aug 22 2016,positive,loved it very funny better than original the references to old ones are perfect
Aug 22 2016,positive,this was a crazy fun romp with an extremely talented cast this movie was miles better and multitudes less cheesy than the original even so they gave a great nod to the original by getting all of the living cast members save rick moranis to take a small role    liam helmsworth was hilarious and played the role well it was fun to watch him do a very playful comedy role he really showed some additional range in the film    leslie jones is my new favorite actress to watch for i will pay to see her in whatever shes doing next she had a sincerity heart and personality that was outsized for the role but fit right in really well    no one is handing out an oscar for the plot development on this one but that misses the point of the movie it had more than enough other things going for it to overlook a couple of major plot holes    sadly i feel like the movie was prophetic in seeing the misogyny in response to it with the line bitches aint bustin no ghosts that sums up the general feeling of pathetic manbabies who seem to hate this film with no good reason except its a remake with a bunch of badass comedy women    go see it youll be glad you did and make sure you stay through the credits
Aug 22 2016,negative,worst movie of 2016 to date
Aug 22 2016,positive,its better than the first for sure
Aug 22 2016,positive,highly underestimated some stupid fans stupidly compare this fun movie to the old ones it is just not fair they r both good
Aug 22 2016,positive,very good  so bad that the haters are ruining the likes
Aug 22 2016,negative,i have liked movies from mccarty and team like bridesmaids but thisthis movie is so enveloped in this sjw feminist garbage that it hurt the film tremendously and for those who will say i hated it because it was a female cast blah blah shut the fuck up please you sound so ignorant for example wonder woman stars a female lead and im super excited for itkill bill also female lead great movie and many more so whats your excuse now  exactly its just a poor film
Aug 21 2016,negative,a couple of laughs but a mostly terrible movie no tie in with the original films
Aug 21 2016,positive,very fun movie i loved the cameos from the original cast there were some very clever lines  some jokes that were dumb but funny none the less i particularly liked melissa mccarthys character the physical comedy was toned done  she was much more likable
Aug 21 2016,positive,i thought it was great super fun
Aug 21 2016,positive,id love to have seen more to this
Aug 21 2016,neutral,ultimately this movie is not good nor is it terrible its just another average summer comedy with wacky slapstick and obvious set ups for jokes that dont entirely feel like natural dialogue is it better than the original ghostbusters or even nearly as good no is it better than ghostbusters 2 debatable
Aug 21 2016,positive,ghostbusters is directed by paul feig and is a reboot to 1984 ghostbusters previous to its release this film received a lot of backlash for its allfemale cast and its unfunny trailer in fact on youtube this is one of the most disliked trailers out there in my opinion this is not a terrible film and it has a great cast with great visuals and even stands out on its own but it just cant live up to the original    the movie follows erin gilbert kristen wiig who is a professor and the author of a paranormal book she meets up with her oldest friend abby yates melissa mccarthey and her partner jillian kate mckinnon to find ghosts and capture them they eventually run into patty leslie jones who brings in her uncles hearse and offers her assistance then things start to get heated when a man named rowan neil casey decides to release portals to flood new york with the paranormal    this is a good ghostbusters for this generation i had a lot of fun watching it and i thought it was funny the special effects were well done with the silly green glowing spirits that puke up slim then there was the chaotic ending with the colossus sized ghost who just destroys everything and looks funny doing it it reminded me of goosebumps that came out last year i felt that same kind of energy but this one has more adult humor    the humor comes from the four leads who just always has something funny to say particularly from kate mckinnons character who is a crazy oddball character then there is the secretary kevin played by chris hemsworth who is a handsome buff man who is completely stupid and wears glasses with no lenses so the lenses wont get dirty he was extremely funny the whole cast is great fun and i would love to see them again in another entry the problem is the amount of humor we do receive this movie is funny but then again its isnt as funny as paul feigs other films such as spy or bridesmaids there were many times i expected it to become more hilarious but it gets bogged down in all the action  dont get me wrong as i said this a funny film but it just needed to be funnier given the director and cast     another problem with the film is the film itself it tries really hard to be in the shoes of the original but the story is so predictable and straightforward that it just shows us why reboots need to be better i believe a reboot should improve upon the original for the new generation to see this doesnt do much of that it retains a great cast and improves the visuals and even the action but it seems to lose the heart and a large amount of humor that the original has set it has many references to the original but would stand better if it was more of a spiritual successor than reboot    so that being said i still enjoyed this movie it has the paul feig sense of humor and silly fun that i love to see in a movie it even has cameos from the original cast and slimer that are a delight to see on screen so all in all this movie is an enjoyable ride and i had fun watching it
Aug 21 2016,negative,horrible two hours ill never get back
Aug 21 2016,negative,this is what happens when hollywood looks to feminism to sell movies
Aug 21 2016,neutral,i laughed some but mostly felt dutiful
Aug 21 2016,positive,thoroughly enjoyable sad that the online reviews have been hijacked  this is a fun blockbustertype movie
Aug 21 2016,positive,ghostbusters was a fine remake it wasnt horrible it wasnt amazing it was just fine the second act struggled a lot but when there were a few good jokes in there and there were a few good ghostbusting scenes but thats it
Aug 21 2016,positive,way better than expected and a good nod to the old classics
Aug 21 2016,positive,fun laughed a decent amount kate mckinnon stole the show dont have much desire to rewatch it anytime soon though
Aug 21 2016,positive,i was a hater to the idea of a reboot but after being dragged in to see it i loved it  give this a chance a great balance pg horror action and most of all great comedy do me a favor dont judge until youve actually seen it i think youll like it
Aug 21 2016,negative,the worse movie ever
Aug 20 2016,negative,beautiful but story eh
Aug 20 2016,negative,it was ok not as funny as i hoped leslie jones and kate mckinnon were stand outs the others were kinda dull
Aug 20 2016,negative,theres a reason why so few people went to see this film if there was a winning formula that made the original film a hit they clearly changed the equation while trying to use the same jokes
Aug 20 2016,positive,not an oscar worthy movie but entertaining throughout
Aug 20 2016,positive,excellent film even better than the original  i loved the effects and the characters so hilarious
Aug 20 2016,positive,it was a funny movie and very wired in a good way 
Aug 20 2016,positive,such a funny film a must see
Aug 20 2016,positive,the ladys ghost busters are amazing  but the story is poor
Aug 20 2016,neutral,was expecting it to be equal or better than the original 30 years ago and no cameo appearance by rick moranis
Aug 20 2016,positive,well i thought this movie was amazing superfunny entertaining and great cast
Aug 20 2016,negative,complete crap stop fing up movie by adding agenda and political correctness
Aug 20 2016,negative,how the hell can you f up so much a movie if you replay the original one with women itd be awesome but this
Aug 20 2016,positive,good and funny but i still love the original
Aug 20 2016,positive,i have to say i was one of the ones throwing shit at the film and it did shut me up the cast did an amazing job and kept me on the sit till the end and i can honestly say i loved it my kids have never seen the gb and they loved the movie in 3d it drove them nuts the only part i would throw away is too much emphasis on the womanmen obsession over the male secretary to keep it a 100 family film but other than that it did deliver a good time will definitely watch it more than once
Aug 20 2016,negative,i went see this movie with an open mind but after only 20min i had to realize that this movie is a huge crap the old movies deserved a better revival than this it is clear that it was only done to milk the viewers
Aug 19 2016,positive,i loved it it was a completely different take on the ghostbusters universe with small references to the originals it had great funny characters and did a wonderful job at entertaining and just being a delight i had a really good time more moves should remember that thats the important thing
Aug 19 2016,positive,true to the original as far as technology and actionhumor balance goes brings new life to the franchise and doesnt require people to have seen the originals many easter eggs throughout for those who have solid 810 in my book
Aug 19 2016,positive,great movie i love the new cast
Aug 19 2016,negative,i saw this movie a complete dumpster fire all the male characters are complete morons the old cast were the only funny parts i laughed at oh yes bad guy is a man who needs to be shot in the groin the running gag on the character getting slimed every few moments was not funny even once
Aug 19 2016,neutral,great opening strong first act shaky second act that quickly dissolved into messy inexplicable unmotivated badly executed cg set pieces a real shame
Aug 19 2016,positive,i knew i had to see this movie when i heard that some of my favorite actresses starred in it and i was in love with it from start to finish
Aug 19 2016,positive,this movie was a lot of fun to watch wiig mccarthy stone mckinnon and hemsworth were hilarious
Aug 19 2016,positive,pretty funny movie with a variety of character personalities
Aug 19 2016,positive,i am a huge ghostbusters fan and this film plays a great homage to the original film without being tacky or losing its own freshens and originality all four girls are amazing ghostbusters and i hope they come with a sequel
Aug 19 2016,positive,much funnier than i expected an awesome movie  well worth it
Aug 19 2016,neutral,typical example of a quasiindependent idea getting churned by the hollywood machine there are a few laughs but fails to be compelling and often misses the mark the female cast is not the issue here but the rushed plot and complete lack of quality in bill murrays scene is
Aug 19 2016,positive,loved it funny and a good reboot with a good plot a true masterpiece
Aug 19 2016,positive,obviously not a patch upon the original however with an extensive screen time keeps you entertained throughout the laughs are few and far between however the charisma of the cast helps you stay content with your viewing experience overall the feminist reboot was almost destined to fail however surprised me and delivered an authentic presentation with a range of references to keep the devoted fans at ease
Aug 19 2016,positive,a little too much stupid modern humor but solid movie  would get more credit if there was no original to compare it to
Aug 19 2016,positive,such a fun movie  great acting great cast  fun movie for everyone
Aug 19 2016,positive,better than i thought
Aug 19 2016,neutral,for all the hype meh
Aug 19 2016,negative,this movie was awful not cause of actors but cause the overall thing just sucked the main characters were weak because their supporting characters were morons and their villain wasnt anything special either the effects were mediocre at best and the movie just wasnt funny i had high hopes for a ghostbusters remake unfortunately it was not delivered they should have just done a continuation of the old movies
Aug 19 2016,neutral,some very funny moments along with some very unfunny moments makes this pretty forgettable yet not a waste for those of you who dont care for substance and layers in your film this one is for you
Aug 19 2016,neutral,a decent comedy nearly busted down and out by the ghost of the modern classic on which it is based ghostbusters scares up quite a few laughs but never near enough to vanquish the specter of the original to its credit an impressive number of the jokes and gags connect but only a few feel central to the storyjust tailored to fit it as if picked up from the cutting room floor of other feigmccarthy comedies such as the heat those that do hit a bullseye their hunky dumbasabagofhammers receptionist jones slapping a poltergeist out of her coworkerand then continuing the slapping almost make this production worth the hoopla at the end of the day however this ghostbusters is a remakeand not a particularly great one whether or not the demon zuul makes an appearance or the name dr peter venkman pops up is immaterial the 1984 film nonetheless hangs like an albatross around its neck even the very familiar plotpoints angry mayor a geeky vessel for an otherworldly demon a giant puffy big bad weigh down this comedys chances of truly distinguishing itself apart from 1984s ghostbusters as do some inconsequential cameos from the original cast minus harold ramis who passed away in 2014 that merely fan the flames of the reunion that couldve been more than warms audiences to the new kid in town its an impossible feat to shake off its predecessor as it rightly ranks as one of the afis top 100 comedies of alltime number 28 if youre keeping score and any attempt to soldier on without linking the two generations is a mistake feig tries anyway however the writerdirector is simply a stronger scenarist maidofhonorfrom hell mccarthy in a spy flick than writer were living in an era where nostalgia sequels  followups that are reverential to the past while moving the story forward with new players  are ruing the day and box office jurassic world creed star wars the force awakens he wrongly chose not to pass the torch from cast to cast in his defense jurassic world creed and star wars the force awakens all hit theaters after production on ghostbusters began so it was just a creative gamblenot seemingly borne of arrogance    in this pg13rated scifi comedy redo from director paul feig a team of scientists mccarthy wiig kate mckimmon and a ny transit worker leslie jones team up to combat an outbreak of paranormal activity     from the simplistic connectthedots framework to caricatures as opposed to characters ghostbusters v20  as funny as it is at times  is just not a strong enough movie on its own merits for example kate mckimmon is quirky and just invents mindbending equipment on the fly but as fun and scenestealing as her performance ends up to be no ones really buying her actions the original film owned everything it put out there meanwhile including the popscience speaking of casting however no production could ask for a better and more talented roster of comedians despite the jokes and gags that they sell through like master comics theyre simply pushing the proverbial sisyphus stone frustratingly hemsworths character and performance as the aforementioned receptionist is ghostbusters most original stroke of comic brilliance which is not good for a movie thats wrongly attracted sexist vitriol    bottom line boo who
Aug 19 2016,positive,hilarious injustice that this movie seems to have a poor ratings i loved it if only all the 80s reboots they were doing lately were this good special effects were great and i loved each character especially kate mckinnon the end credits were fun to watch and seeing the old ghostbusters gang show up was a fun surprise throughout
Aug 19 2016,negative,an overall meh film that succeeds in hurting the ip it used this movie is just plain not good the characters are bad  the acting is bad the comedy is bad  and childish the best actor is chris hemsworth who for some reason is portrayed as an idiot in what i can only see as some sort of weird reference to women secretaries in movies  except the secretary in the 1984 ghost busters was kick ass all four busters were cartoon like or racial stereotypes   especially jillian holtzmann and pattie the male characters were also portrayed as idiots or meanie faces such variety not to mention the whole campaign that sony and other entities such as the atlantic daily beast and  ign took part in that basically said all criticism from this film stemmed from sexism which is extremely false its just a bad movie    tldr its an adam sandler esque movie that unlike his movies fails to fall into the so bad its good category instead it just falls into the bad category also stop blaming sexism on what amounts to terrible direction and acting  beware of any paul feig movies from now on
Aug 19 2016,negative,good god i was dragged to this movie by a friend of mine who offered to pay my ticket as well as for snacks i should have said no my god i should have said no     the plot of the movie was weak and there were plot holes big enough to drive the uss enterprise through at one point the ghostbusters cant do something and then they can the movie makes up its own rules and just is really awful     next the cast is dreadful call me a manhater or a misogynist or whatever sjw term you can come up with but i really dont fucking care because the cast of the movie didnt gel together they didnt they would step on each others lines make jokes that were funny and follow it up with something unfunny and just be really odd they had a possibility to pull this off and they failed miserably     the special effects cmon honestly really haunted mansion had better effects in it i am dead serious when i say this     i also love how no one talks about how this movie is sexist towards men or even racist most of the men are depicted as  mindless brutish idiots that dont have common sense or anything else for that matter kevin is the biggest culprit of this really chris hemsworth you needed a paycheck for this movie so bad to make you look like a clown i dont think i can even see another thor movie because all i am going to see is this bumbling idiot     in closing i am not mad that paul feig was trying to rape my childhood as part of me wanted to see it a very small part of me wanted to see this movie continue the tradition and legend of ghostbusters instead all we got was a blatant cash grab and rt trying to do damage control saying the movie is at 73 with critics really if thats the case why is it operating at a 70100million dollar loss the movie is not there its not funny it has a lame villain whos destroyed by shooting him in the crotch wtg feminists and its just awful avoid at all costs
Aug 19 2016,positive,loved the film laughed all the way through great work girls    an aquarium is a submarine for fish 
Aug 19 2016,negative,slow and boring  which is sad because i love every one of these actors  the comedy is forced and the story is slow and the entire film should have gone straight to dvd
Aug 18 2016,negative,although the movie had its moments the general takeaway was actually a let down you can watch it but please dont expect too much
Aug 18 2016,negative,i went to see it after much debate and i can honestly say i did not like it there were some parts i liked most of which had holtzmann in them since she had a kinda crazy but funny vibe to her but the rest was pretty dull to watch and i thought it was a little sexist especially with kevin and how dumb they made him and i dont know if it was because of people on the internet or what i just dont know and please no more comments about people not liking the movie being anti feminists they have a right to their opinion too guys and hope this makes sense 
Aug 18 2016,positive,whenever i see someone wanting to do a remake i cringe because i think the first version was the best and cant be topped because of the actors that made the film on top of the musical score the way it was shot and the story being told they need remake movies that had potential but did poorly work on that some more hollywood but i digress i usually never see those movies however this was different you have an allfemale ghostbusting crew cameos made by actors from the original films and i adore kristen wiig melissa mccarthy and kate mckinnon so i had a feeling i would be entertained i am not as familiar with leslie jones but she did a great job and hemlock was fun too the movie was very entertaining and it was great to see several beloved actors return in cameo roles throughout the entire film the multilayered ending of the film was also a special treat it doesnt take away from the original movies and comes with its own charm i still appreciate the original films but yes our audience had a lot of fun we were laughing throughout the entire movie and those that actually watched the original movies clapped with me each time we recognized an actor from the original films thanks
Aug 18 2016,positive,what is all the griping about yes its a mainstream comedy it also has great jokes and i was entertained the whole time there was never really a dry spell but i felt they paced the movie at a good speed  also as a side note the way they did the cameos were the best cameos ive ever seen
Aug 18 2016,positive,conclusive evidence that whoever crafts paul feigs trailers really does not know how to sell his movies a fine funny time not the original ghostbusters which noone should have expected it to be not great and yet despite what the internet says not really all that terrible either
Aug 18 2016,positive,most of the haters on this film are sexist plain and simple  dont forget i said most
Aug 18 2016,negative,i would rather drag my nuts thru broken glass before i watch more than 30 seconds of this crap of a movie  why is melissa mccarthy famous we will never know
Aug 18 2016,positive,was not as good as i thought it would be but still very funny although at the same time it was pretty much a snooze fest
Aug 18 2016,negative,pointless cashin on a popular franchise the fact they sued bill murray to appear and then kill him is insulting ultimately sorta kinda fun rarely but not worth your money and the cameos in this movie is stupid so i dont recommend unless you really want to see it 310 
Aug 18 2016,negative,glad this movie is doing so poorly hopefully while slandering the detractors as sexist they learn a lesson about allowing creativity over selling a narrative they had nothing of value to advertise this movie with so they had to sell it as pandering feminist propaganda which the movie fails at miserably          feig claimed early on that the reason he wanted to do his own version was so the female leads could create their own ghost hunting technology but that isnt what happens in the film their tech sucks it barely works they rework their machines based on the designs of the villain a man feig failed at his goal the film fails at female empowerment the social commentary is bizarre its like they preemptively wrote insults for derision to the film before it even happened cause theres no way theyd be able to edit this much into the film with three months to go          the rest of the film is excessively bland the story is a terrible amalgamation of the plots of the original two the jokes are as terrible as what were shown in the trailers and the entire thing is filmed more like another lazy chuck lorre sitcom every single character is a moron and it never leads to anything kristen wiigs character kills someone through her stupidity but it means nothing to the story rowan is dull as a character and a villain mckinnon is a cliche wacky scientist and jones has moments of development ruined by loud black woman scenes that tyler perry would be proud of and i literally forgot that mccarthy was a part of this her big running joke was some nonsense about wonton soup          only rarely does the film enter so bad its good territory its just blah dont buy it dont encourage this in any way just pirate it or find a movie streaming site if youre so curious like i did
Aug 18 2016,negative,i took my daughter to see it and was very disappointed the story line is weak and the acting was terrible there were a few funny moments but most of those were the scenes with the token male secretary its simply not a very good movie
Aug 18 2016,neutral,i didnt think ghostbusters was awful but i didnt think it was exceptionally strong  i thought it was nicely paced but a lot of the jokes seemed forced and not authentic  i thought the story was a good back bone for a potentially great movie but there wasnt enough characterization or depth put into it  i liked the cast and i thought there was potential for decent chemistry there  i thought the ghost cgi was pretty decent  all in all im glad i saw it and i dont think it deserved all of the negative criticisms that it garnered during its development but its release didnt dispel some of those criticisms
Aug 18 2016,negative,does not setup jokes as much as beats you over the head with fart oneliners  as much comedic value as the average sandler film
Aug 18 2016,positive,i thought this remake was great  mccarthy was hilarious as always  absolutely love her most of the original cast made an appearance which was great  hemsworth character was stupidly funny go see it
Aug 18 2016,negative,why why make this movie to right the wrongs against women who is this targeted at or made for i know there is a lack of original stories around but somehow they still manage to make a worse movie than the original nearly walked out from the theatre for the first time in years 2 stars mostly for the acting of erin she was funny in a relaxed way
Aug 18 2016,negative,huge disappointment  the cast was great but the writing was drab  where was the funny   skip it  wish i had
Aug 17 2016,positive,pretty good better than expected to bad it didnt gross enough money to warrant a 2nd outing
Aug 17 2016,positive,it was better than i expected
Aug 17 2016,neutral,predictable forgettable dull same plot as original definitely the 80s release was a much better choice to watch the fx were great in 3d format specially the post and precredits
Aug 17 2016,neutral,its not the fault of the women cast ghostbusters has a lazy script that tries too hard to be funny
Aug 17 2016,negative,not great at all went in open minded but its more of a womens comedy
Aug 17 2016,negative,the defenition of whats wrong with hollywood and the pc culture
Aug 17 2016,positive,better than the original  hilarious  the new ghostbusters refuses to be a remake  instead it offers new characters and a new story flavored with references to the original
Aug 17 2016,negative,its a lame movie were feminazis wanted to push woman rights
Aug 17 2016,positive,this movie was absolutely hilarious the actresses did a great job and seemed a little rushed and little slow in the begining but i love some of the original gbz cameo in the movie hemsworth showed more of his comedic side in this one which was awesome honestly idk know whats the deal with some of these critics but just because someone is doing a reboot dosent necessarily make it an automatic flop but thanks to these trigger happy critics and overprice movie tickets great reboots dont make it to a sequel come on ppl wherez the love
Aug 17 2016,positive,absolutely amazing funniest thing ive seen in years the actresses are wonderful the writing is stellar want to see a thousand times
Aug 17 2016,negative,there is no doubt that the first one was great for its time but this one did not really come close to being as humorous or entertaining i wanted to love the idea that it was all woman roles and that some of the old actors would appear but i am afraid that was not enough kind of disappointed
Aug 17 2016,positive,a lot scarier than the first one
Aug 17 2016,positive,so so funny the cast is great and elements of the original movie were woven in really well as cheeky homage
Aug 17 2016,negative,garbage a wanna be comedy that is not funny at all with overacted cast and plot holes all over the place
Aug 17 2016,negative,i had my opinion well before the movie came out and i said i was not going to see the movie at all i broke down the other day and decided to give it a shot and keep an open mind well visually it was quite stunning i just thought the acting was a bit flat didnt have the feel of a ghostbuster type movie to me going to keep this short and sweet and end it here because i could go on all day about how it falls way short of being called a good movie
Aug 17 2016,negative,sorry  i wanted to like it but no
Aug 17 2016,negative,well it was going to happen sometime this year werent it well lets get on with it then  so this movie as you know is a reboot of the 1984 classic of the same name and it just so happens to be directed by paul feig director of movies like bridesmaids and spy  im not going to lie some of the stuff paul feig has directed is pretty descent movies like spy are undeniably hilarious  however the trailers and the constant back flash that followed them did not do this family film justice however critics have reviewed this movie as a pretty solid standalone reboot while the reviews for this movie mostly praise it ghostbusters is one of the worst family movies ive ever seen  honestly this movie was worse than all the 1st michael bay produced ninja turtles movie all the fantastic 4 movies nearly all the transformers sequels and yes at times it was worse than green lantern i know some of those technically arent family films im just trying to make my point this movie was absolutely awful  just to be a little more charitable lets start with the good for starters chris hemsworth had some genuinely funny moments id even say he was the best part of this movie i also really liked the cameos from the original ghostbusters cast they were pretty cool to see and well timed ill even say unfortunately thats all i can say thats good about this movie  so now for the bad sigh   for starters this movie is almost a complete and utter rehash of the original movie you literally have to watch the original movie twice and youve pretty much seen this movie even the characters are complete copies and yes i know that this is technically a reboot but this new cast bring absolutely nothing new to the table there literally just ripped from the original you have the scientist who doesnt believe ghost at first and then starts the ghost busters you have the scientist best friend who is nuts about ghost and really wants to catch them then youve got the person who build all the equipment and the new comer who wants to join the ghostbusters its literally a carbon copy of the original ghostbusters im sorry but lesly jones was unbearable in this movie she just said something weird every 2 seconds and the rest of the time her character was just completely oblivious to everything and it annoyed me intensely in fact the performances from the rest of the cast minus hemsworth just came off as really over the top and silly and it just did not work at all theres even a really stupid side plot where the mare of the city trys to cover up the ghost busters activities its arguably the most unimportant plot point in the movie the comedy of this movie largely consists of weird dancing and family film clichés such as the main character going crazy trying to tell everyone something she knows is going to sound nuts this isnt really funny in my opinion i dont know about you guys but i honestly fail to see how chris hemsworth getting possessed by a ghost and then doing crazy tricks on a motor cycle is funny to me that just looks like im watching an episode of looney tunes admittedly there were a couple of times where i did chuckle but the rest of the time i just felt bored and unentertained a lot of the jokes really dont land very well and are often at times just horribly executed i will admit that the only character that didnt come off as a total copy of the original was kate mckinnon as holtzman she wasnt a totally unoriginal but like i said earlier her performance like everyone else minus hemsworth just came off as over the top and silly to the point where it just did not fit the tone of the movie there are actually times when the movie tried to seem scary witch actually felt reallly out of place because one its a family film and a comedy though it is a welcomed edition because it seemed original and while admitedlly none of the attempts to scare really worked infact they pretty poor it was nice knowing that they at least tried with it even it failed misserably  this movie is also horribly shot its shot as if its a sit com with these horribly executed wide shots at one point i actually thought i was watching an episode of jessie and unfortunately these wide shots are constant throughout the film they just do not stop i like wide shots occasionally particularly in action movies but we need close ups sometimes to see a proper reaction or to show that a certain twist or line of dialogue is a lot more important that you realise but in this film almost every shot is a wide shot and at times it can look really bad particularly in the final act of the film whenever there was a close up shot it happened very rarely at the least important time and its because of these wide shots that a lot of the jokes dont land because there are going to be times when you need a close up shot so people can properly see what is actually happening thats supposed to be funny and there was a point where it was a really wide shot during something that was supposed to be funny i couldnt really see what was actually meant to be funny because there was so much happening in that shot that i couldnt tell what i was supposed to looking at to get a laugh out of  however honest to captain flipping america the cgi was awful ghostbusters has the worst speacial effects i have seen all year round the cgi ghosts will go from cgi blobs splattered all over the screen it looked so cartoony the films climax is when the cgi is at its worst and it just got to the point when it reminded me of 2015s fantastic 4 thats not something you want to remind your viewers of just watching the ghost busters fight that giant ghost in the end was like watching an even worse version of the doomsday fight from batman v superman and that wasnt a good sequence as it is even the lazer beams that came out of the ghostbusters proton packs looked fake the cgi was just soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo obvious  on the whole ghostbusters was just an unbearable expierience its not a movie i will be seeing again any time soon if this movie ever gets a sequel i will not be in the long que of people waiting to see it infact i would much rather watch suicide squad again
Aug 17 2016,negative,if i could give this movie no stars i would i have never wanted to get up in the middle of a movie more im a feminist and all for making lady movies but make em funny kate mckinnon was horrendous in this movie the other ladies had great acting skills but werent working with a good script two thumbs wayyyy way down
Aug 17 2016,negative,the most horrible movie this year and possibly ever and no its not because the cast is all women and that all men in the film are either retards or assholes     this is a very bad movie with one million jokes that all fall flat that doesnt work at all as a movie and does even worse as a ghostbusters reboot   there is no point in even looking at details as characterizations or plotholes or anything the actors perform horribly the jokes are clunky and forced and the obligatory cameos oh my easily the worst part of the movie
Aug 17 2016,positive,this film is not perfect not enough holtzmann amirite  also i am a die hard fan of the original  however this reboot is pretty good  its funny for one  and two it makes a big statement about the state of female roles in movies and if this film were graced with one id definitely watch a sequel just because i wanna see more holtzmann amirite
Aug 16 2016,positive,better than i thought it was gonna be
Aug 16 2016,neutral,there wasnt any memorable lines in this for me son playing the see this or you hate women almost made me decide to never watch a sony picture ever
Aug 16 2016,positive,cute movie i loved seeing all the old characters blended in with the new version of this movie the story was there in the beginning but it fizzed out at the end 
Aug 16 2016,positive,great reboot loved all the cameos cant wait for part 2 rip hr
Aug 16 2016,positive,im thinking my expectations for this movie were too high  kate mckinnon was the best
Aug 16 2016,positive,awesome movie hoping that eventually people will get over the fact that women were in the lead roles
Aug 16 2016,negative,i honestly tried to give this a chance i like the actresses and figured the hate was just hate if i thought theyd have given my 925 back or atleast comped me a sprite i wouldve walked out half way  if the movie is memorable for anything but consuming the snl discard pile it would be for dethroning garfield as bill murrays greatest shame
Aug 16 2016,positive,so hilarious really recommend seeing this
Aug 16 2016,negative,a bad idea but not as bad a film as i expected cameos by all living ghostbusters
Aug 16 2016,positive,i loved it  almost as good as the original and stands pretty well on its own i think the only mistake is they went a little too far with the idiocy of the assistant
Aug 16 2016,negative,severe comedy reaching awkward poor ad libing cast was lost boring even an excited 7 year old not impressed very poor and lazy remake attempt
Aug 16 2016,negative,i just hate this film so much this was the worse of 2016this film belongs in hell
Aug 15 2016,positive,haters be damned this film was every bit as good as i had hoped rapid fire jokes great special effects and plenty of nods nudges winks and nods to the original classic
Aug 15 2016,negative,beyond terrible the first joke is a nasty queef joke unbelievably crass and unacceptable for a movie targeting young girls
Aug 15 2016,negative,if i could give 0 stars i would a disgrace to the original ghostbusters
Aug 15 2016,negative,bill murray makes a very short cameo in the film and they just treat him like garbage in this film his acting in this looked like that of fear and torment he must have known the film was bound to be a flop
Aug 15 2016,negative,hard for me to understand the positive reviews for this movie and most people i have spoken to had the same low opinion of it as me the leads are generally good comedians but the humor was pretty flat as was the storys trajectory
Aug 15 2016,positive,it was good movie waaaaay better than ghostbusters 2 come on people 2 sux rehash of the story from the first film its like saying thattmnt 2 was greatat least its something new
Aug 15 2016,negative,the only reason it gets half is because i have to give it something
Aug 15 2016,negative,i sat through this movie stone faced this movie has no redeeming qualities it was not funny it was not entertaining it was a waste of money and a waste of time i went to see it just to give it a chance because i love the original but this completely fell flat
Aug 15 2016,negative,it was so terribly disappointing the few funny parts were already in the previews and those were bad in and of themselves  it is not worth the mony save yourself the pain and go watch something else
Aug 15 2016,positive,at least as entertaining and funny as the original but should be judged on its own merits rather than compared to the classic  the entire cast was excellent  i was surprised by the hilarity of chris hemsworths character  top to bottom a great day at the movies
Aug 15 2016,negative,wanted to give the girls a chance but it was way too disappointing a great cast cannot lift a terrible script enjoyed the cameos of the original cast though
Aug 15 2016,positive,very enjoyable and nowhere near deserving of the flack it received mckinnon proves to be a particular gem script could have used more laughs given the cast though
Aug 15 2016,negative,i want my money back  that movie sucked   
Aug 15 2016,positive,yo stop being sexists this was a great movie
Aug 15 2016,positive,this is really funny and i like what direction they are trying to go in i think its better than the original
Aug 15 2016,positive,funniest film ive seen in years i laughed like a seal enough of a tribute to the original to have the same spirit but somehow lighter hearted and without that dreadful romance subplot
Aug 15 2016,positive,haters gonna hate    ever since the news broke a few years ago that a femaleled remake of the 1984 comedy classic ghostbusters was in the works the internet has been awash with posts from people who hated the idea the audacity of it all they claim after all the original story starring bill murray st vincent dan ackroyd harold ramis and ernie hudson as the eponymous spirit catchers holds a hallowed place in our collective hearts how could women possibly match up the hostility was ratcheted up to a whole new level when the first trailer was released in march of this year it has since become youtubes most disliked video with close to a million thumbs down as of july 26 2016 but the vile armchair critics werent done when the film premiered a few weeks ago they took to the cybersphere again this time dissing actress leslie jones who attended the event wearing an impeccably tailored red dress yes shes big brash and black get over it you weenies    but heres the thing how many of these people were actually around in 1984 and when was the last time they saw they original film    i wouldnt be able to ask the second part of that question unless i watched the film again which i did the other night i hadnt watched it since it came out 32 years ago guess what it wasnt as good as i remembered it to be in the film murray delivers his usual deadpan irreverent shtick as parapsychologist peter venkman the other actors are often left gapemouthed as they try to both digest his ad libbed riff and come up with something equally funny more often than not they cant and they stumble aykroyd meanwhile often falls back into his tv pitchman persona a character he honed in his years as a not ready for prime time player on tvs saturday night live he was funny selling the super bassomatic there not so funny here but we all love that movie because we love the actors we love ray parker jrs song we love the stay puft marshmallow man and we love the logo    in case you havent heard ghostbusters 2016 is neither a sequel nor a reboot its a reimagining same premise different story get it instead of being a maleled story sigourney weaver and annie potts were the only two women acting in the original the new ghostbusters only has a couple of male characters in the cast in this version erin gilbert snl alumna kristen wiig is a physics professor at a prestigious ny university her quiet life and plans for tenure are thrown into disarray when her childhood friend abby yates melissa mccarthy spy st vincent puts a book about the paranormal that they cowrote years ago for sale on amazon abby is holed up in the basement of a spurious institute of higher learning also in ny along with her colleague engineer jillian holtzmann kate mckinnon also snl the two women are ghost hunters with holtzmann inventing crazy devices à la doc brown from back to the future that the women use to find the ghosts and neutralise them the quartet is rounded out by transit worker and history buff patty tolan leslie jones also of snl fame who asserts herself on the group after she sees an apparition on the subway tracks    much like the original story when a ghost makes an appearance not at the new york public library but this time at an old manhattan mansion the ladies are called in to investigate they quickly realise that they are outclassed by the apparition and they have to go back and get the big guns the attention the women receive on the internet most of it negative in an obvious middle finger gesture to the haters reaches their institutes dean and abby and jillian lose both their workspace and their funding again like the original theyre undaunted and they quickly find new digs theyre shown the same unused firehouse that was featured in the original but they cant afford it instead they move upstairs from a chinese restaurant they also hire a receptionist and again in a 180degree turn from the original the ladies hire a man  and a hunky dumb blond one at that kevin chris hemsworth thor is as dense as they come but erin is smitten by their new piece of eye candy unfortunately this plot line goes nowhere    as in the original more ghosts appear and the women employ more sophisticated technology to nab them however unlike the original the mayor played by andy garcia is less than supportive of their efforts publicly dismissing the group as sad lonely women no doubt another middle finger gesture to the haters it culminates in a massive hole opening in the nexus where fury rains down on the city    to its credit the script is peppered with pop culture references that werent around in 1984 such as reddit and oprah the special effects arent anything special but perhaps they dont need to be youre not going to see this film because of the cgi towards the end of the film director paul feig spy sets the stage for what appears to be a michael jacksoninspired dance number but that too goes nowhere and what were left with doesnt make much sense all is revealed however in the closing credits    ill admit that ghostbusters 2016 is not a great movie but its at least as good as its progenitor its fun summertime entertainment and it features many of the original cast including murray ackroyd hudson weaver and potts in cameo roles sadly harold ramis passed away in 2014 and rick moranis declined to appear in the film    and guess what it shows that women can rock too
Aug 15 2016,positive,an enjoyable wellpaced movie with a good cast who do a good job with what they are given   that said it felt like a remake of the original with better special effects though they added very little to the original  i left the film feeling the director missed the opportunity to introduce ideas and played it safe my remaking the original with a simple gender swap  entertaining but nothing new
Aug 14 2016,positive,why was there no female rami i love rami but none here still liked the movie tough even without rami did i mention i wanted rami in this
Aug 14 2016,positive,i remember the original ghostbusters movies as a kid i loved them i was a huge fan of the cartoon series as a kid as well i actually really liked this movie not just because of nostalgia but it was funny i also loved the cameos from some of the original ghostbusters cast members i would definitely see a sequel if they made one
Aug 14 2016,positive,safety lights are for dudes
Aug 14 2016,positive,an ensemble cast that really had fun interactions together i loved the first act with the first ghost wouldve loved to have seen her be the main villain i felt the main villain to be kind of annoying  but otherwise fun movie
Aug 14 2016,negative,question did the critics actually watch this movie
Aug 14 2016,positive,dont understand the hate long time ghostbusters fan since i was born  did me proud and i hope the film gets the sequel it deserves
Aug 14 2016,negative,nop should have tried somthing original and left the classics alone
Aug 14 2016,positive,sony pictures attempts to sell ghostbusters 2016 to a worldwide audience might very well go down as the worst marketing campaign in film history i was initially onboard for a ghostbusters remakereboot when an all female cast was announced with paul feig bridesmaids the heat on board as director it seemed as if the project was in good handsand then the trailers came out unfunny nonsensical sequences that were presented as punchlines wave after wave of disastrous teasers were released it was almost as if the studio didnt want the project to succeed at all they still hold the record as the most disliked videos in youtubes brief history upon viewing the final product and to my own astonishment the trailers showcased nothing more than mere transition scenesall the good stuff was hidden inside although far from classic territory ghostbusters 2016 is fantastic on its own terms i havent seen a reinterpretation of a beloved classic executed so well since john carpenters 1982 remake of howard hawks the thingyep its really is that good i laughed almost from start to finish the cg is surprisingly thrilling and the chemistry of the 4 leads is impeccable no one steals scenes from kate mckinnon shes a bizarre wonder hopefully not of the onehit kind if theres one flaw it would be with chris hemsworth who tries just a little too hard to be stupid and funny the majority of that flaw can really be laid upon the writers though as hemsworth has already proven his talent before its a forgone conclusion that the sexist purists who protested the film can suck it as a former naysayer questioning the films quality though i say just see the damn thing it does the spirit of the original proud while painting a picture all its own
Aug 14 2016,positive,funny and entertaining pleasant surprise much better than the trailer led me to believe i took my children and they loved it
Aug 14 2016,negative,great first ten minutes
Aug 14 2016,positive,while it didnt do a great job of keeping up the world is going to end tension it was fun and funny and kate mckinnon kicked ass
Aug 14 2016,negative,terrible omfg by far the absolute worst movie i saw in years    ridiculous a true shame    a true infamy to the series
Aug 14 2016,positive,this was an amazing movie i loved how they made it about girl power because its 2016 and a big thing on social media right now is feminism and they gave us what we want
Aug 14 2016,positive,ghostbusters proves that fun in the cinema is alive againno pun intended a sensational cast leads a wellwritten story through twists turns and just the right amount of cheesy its a breath of fresh air for the box office
Aug 14 2016,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed this take on the original idea it was tons of fun and filled with homages to the 1984 original    the original is my favorite movie ever and while this doesnt reach the same level i highly recommend it for goofy summer fun
Aug 14 2016,positive,hilarious i was worried that the best scenes were shown on the trailers but this is not the case with ghostbusters very funny movie with heart
Aug 14 2016,negative,terrible movie the jokes came off as boring and forced the cgi made me question if i was watching scooby or haunted mansion i wouldnt say it is crappier than dragon ball the movie wasbut it is right up there
Aug 14 2016,negative,redbox it if youre interested
Aug 14 2016,positive,not bad not good jokes start out funny then get a little lost moving the plot forward could use a sequel though with a good script
Aug 14 2016,negative,first off we need to rid ourselves of the absurdity that is the femnazis women can do it better and the neanderthals women should remain in the kitchen cliques that have plagued this movie from the word go with the teaser trailer over a year ago i had zero interest in this film personally for many different reasons some of which i will explain here now but because of the lunacy that it has created i felt an obligation to check it out and review it for the other objective and intelligent people in my life so that we can separate the bias madness vs whether or not the film is actually any good lets get started shall we     while its understandable for those who are younger and had never seen the original when it was initially released it can be argued that it hasnt stood the test of the time or aged well and im a fan of the first two original flicks but the humor doesnt hold up quite as well for me over the years but i do hold a certain nostalgia for the film because i did see it at age 14 in the movie theaters and while most reboots and remakes in this day and age dont do much for me i still like to think im open minded about it because the technology is better and there are still some very good actorsactresses who work in the industry in this modern day      one of the first problems with ghostbusters 2016 though is the way that we got to this version of the reboot itself this was not a natural progression to have an all women cast people forget it was actually slated to star the original actors and if not for the stubbornness of murray and the unfortunate death of harold ramis we may have not even gotten to this point of having the all women cast while its nice from a gender standpoint to have women like fig mccarthy and mckinnon get a chance to shine i cant help but think that this was entirely forced i cant even in good conscience say to myself that this was a great move because the women were basically only an afterthought to begin with this was never really about spotlighting these women and the concept unfortunately comes across very hollow     that aside lets tackle the subject matter and the execution    ok so now having actually viewed the film i have to say the general audience feel and rating is pretty accurate lets start with the pros the film has some very good cgi work as expected for the most part the acting is done well enough albeit a little bland especially in the last hour or so of the film itself i got a couple of chuckles from the evp moment at the beginning and the moment when leslie jones character stage dives at the metal concert but aside from that the laughs were few and far between sadly that is about where it ends in terms of what i really though was good about it one problem is the plot just felt incredibly stupid and not nearly as creative as the original         the cameos by murray akyroyd weaver hudson  potts were adequate but nothing to write home about and probably could have been utilized much better as i stated earlier its unfortunate that these actresses were not the original choice to do this picture and only then forced into a badly designed script i also really dont understand the whole hemsworth role here even potts portrayal of janine from the original movie was never this bad and her character in that movie was never considered dumb in fact she was pretty quick with her sarcasm throughout that film hemsworth just comes across as incredibly childlike and makes no sense half the time too much of this film was just forced from so many different aspects that it was bound to fail from the word go it seems recently it has been announced that there will be no sequel to the film which makes sense because the producers screwed the pooch on this one much to the dismay of the actresses who tried to hard to make it succeed     my rating 510
Aug 14 2016,positive,i dont care what the dude bro women haters club thinks this movie was funny and entertaining it may not become a classic like the original but there is absolutely nothing wrong with the cast or execution of this film it must be lonely in their moms basement
Aug 14 2016,negative,better to watch the varg vikernes youtube videos is a better choice of time wasted
Aug 14 2016,positive,a really laugh out loud movie dare i say it better than the originals
Aug 14 2016,negative,started off well but the story just wasnt good enough and the ghosts looked fake i really wanted to like it but falls flat
Aug 14 2016,positive,i like kate  mckinnon and kristen wiig  and melissa mccarthy and leslie jones
Aug 14 2016,positive,entertaining and done well for a revisit of what ghostbusters was
Aug 14 2016,negative,no comparison to the original movie therefore do not go into this thinking or knowing anything about the original that said everything about the movie was a let down directors made this more like a sarcastic narcissistic unrealistic movie although they did try and make some relation to the original they made horrible relation to it by changing the story so much that they are actually two different story lines thus forcing you to disregard all previously known if they could have made this a continuation of the original it could have gone a long ways absolutely worst movie of 2016 this far
Aug 14 2016,negative,i love the actors but mckinnon and jones were so irritating it was very disappointing the rating should have been 50
Aug 14 2016,positive,funny i loved the allusions sprinkled throughout pertaining to the original ghostbusters movie
Aug 14 2016,negative,i didnt watch this because the trailer was so terrible but im pretty picky about forced comedies and awkward political pandering the funny thing is this is the only rottentomatoes review i can recall where the professional critics were less critical of a dopey movie than the audience dear critics admitting it if you dont like this crappy movie makes you a real movie critic sexism has nothing to do with it
Aug 14 2016,positive,i went and saw this movie and i thoroughly enjoyed it the casting was great and it had just the right amount of action and comedy making a great summer movie outing
Aug 14 2016,negative,if you didnt see the film because of how bad the trailers were you did the right thing the only chuckle from me was from janines cameo and even then it wasnt delivered with the same gusto as the original  bad script and pacing bad cgi and green screen no laughs no scaresmaybe without the licence it could have been a half decent kids only movie
Aug 14 2016,positive,it wasnt as bad as i thought it would be  while it was cheesy at times i thought it was funny with better ghostly renditions
Aug 13 2016,positive,i dont understand why this movie got so many bad reviews it could easily be a classic it was really funny and the cast was great im going to go watch it again
Aug 13 2016,positive,funny respected the past and successfully made a movie that didnt simply repeat an old story
Aug 13 2016,negative,fail to respect the 1st ghostbuster not funny and boring dead on arrival 
Aug 13 2016,negative,looks like reviewers got paid to give it higher ratings eh nobody can be this stupid without a purpose
Aug 13 2016,positive,my girls loved it and now want to be ghost busters
Aug 13 2016,positive,not your fathers ghostbusters but thats ok because im still gonna call them nonetheless
Aug 13 2016,negative,a simple cash grab does not improve on the original movie at all go die in a hole if you like it kys kys kys
Aug 13 2016,negative,an unfunny nostalgia cash in
Aug 13 2016,positive,i think it was great  the final battle was epic and cameos were incredible but i hate kevin
Aug 13 2016,positive,it was ok i didnt like that they made lesile jones part a lower level person then the other  ladies that were scientists
Aug 13 2016,positive,fun funny and femtastic whats not to love kate mckinnon is one of the funniest humans of the 21st century
Aug 13 2016,positive,such a fun and exciting movie with an absolutely fantastic cast and wonderful special effects a really great movie even if some of the jokes were contrived or predictable
Aug 13 2016,positive,the writing and gags were on point but the overall story fizzled somewhere in act 2
Aug 13 2016,positive,hollywood make more movies like ghostbusters please the originals were some of my favorite movies growing up and now that i have kids it was a pleasure to take them to a modern version that was funny smart and just spooky enough also it made my 12yearold daughter cry seriously to finally discover a movie with a squad of intelligent funny cool heroic and supportive women we need more characters like them
Aug 13 2016,positive,a blast from the present  i had a wonderful time
Aug 13 2016,neutral,up until the ghosts are introduced this had all the makings of being a super bad ass remake or revision or whatever this was supposed to be but once the ghosts and the bad guy enters the movie falls way off track the first part of the movie is just super funny with a stellar comedic cast however there is no sugar coating the lack of developments of the bad guyvillain or the sudden explosion of ghosts and unfortunately the ending is just about as bad an ending as a summer blockbuster could have nothing like the staypuff marshmallow man in the original another problem was what was this movie a remake a revision a follow up its never quite clear and that i think shows through in the fact that most will leave thinking this movie was a dud
Aug 13 2016,positive,not that bad could of been a bit funnier
Aug 13 2016,positive,i had very mixed feelings about this movie between not being able to stand a cast member to loving the original i must say i was pleasently surprised by how good it was  very few parts lacked and they did a great tribute to the original i would highly recommend this movie
Aug 13 2016,negative,sucked pc bs but you have to have more strong female characters in films to make them suck
Aug 13 2016,positive,these gals did an amazing job on this remake  i loved the first ghostbusters and loved this one just as much  the critics have no clue  this is a must see movie in my opinion  also if you plan on taking the kids there is very little language issues
Aug 13 2016,positive,great movie even though still cant top the 1984 version it was one of the best movies as well as the secret life of pets
Aug 13 2016,positive,dont understand the hate if the trolls forget the old onesthis was still a pretty good movie
Aug 13 2016,positive,very good film  much funny than i thought it would be  although the last quarter of the film does fall down on the job
Aug 13 2016,positive,solid movie seen it 5 times going to see it every week til its out of theaters
Aug 13 2016,positive,you can say what you want about the all female cast or remaking an alltime classic but this movie was pretty entertaining holtzman alone makes this worth seeing
Aug 13 2016,positive,as a life long ghostbusters fanatic i was really happy with the new one since its reboot i was ok with the fact that it deviated from the original formula it stands on its own and was totally entertaining i enjoyed building new ghostbusters memories with my kids
Aug 13 2016,neutral,great effects of course but it wasnt as funny as it was trying to be there is room to grow if theyre allowed to take another shot at it
Aug 13 2016,positive,this movie was amazing didnt expect it to be as many remakes arent but they really kicked the originals butt awesome special effects great performances strong characters and perfectly placed cameosit really could not have been better
Aug 13 2016,positive,i enjoyed the heck out of this movie and i didnt expect to  great to see four funny ladies and helmsworth held his own beautifully  it was a lot of fun
Aug 13 2016,negative,the first act was the most interesting and original part of this snore fest one the ghosts weak low stakes plot and forced cameos start its all downhill performances were phoned in story and jokes were contrived base unoriginal the villain was light and lame ratings by critics were definitely artificially inflated to counteract fanboy hate truth is that the movie is too bland and forgettable to be worthy of franchise
Aug 13 2016,positive,funny and really cool this movie represent what movies are for the cast is flawless
Aug 13 2016,negative,yeah this was bad objectively bad they set up rules and break them very few of the jokes land the special effects are bad and a lot of the plot elements make no sense its not the worst movie ive ever seen but its very forgettable which is worse this will mostly be remembered for the uproar it caused
Aug 13 2016,positive,they did a great job with this reboot i didnt expect to like it after seeing the trailers but was happily surprised when i saw the movie itself actors are fantastic and holtzmann is great
Aug 13 2016,negative,this movie is horrible we even knew it from the start this movie is so bad it makes the fantastic four reboot look like a master piece first of all no one would act like this chris hemsworths character was so stupid he was funny thought the effects are terrible it looks the effects from the scooby doo live action movies even the look better and none of the jokes are funny its not hilarious and no where near we have lost the great harold ramis about a year and this is how you honor him paul fieg this has to be is worst movie yet
Aug 13 2016,positive,i dont know why people are knocking this movie it is really good    suffice it to say my fiance and i really enjoyed this movie it is sad however that they made the official ghostbusters 3 movie a video game release for ps3 xbox 360 and nintendo wii
Aug 13 2016,negative,despite being open to the idea of a remake with all female leads i didnt laugh once during this film and found the cameos by the original ghostbusters cast to be gratuitous  the filmmakers tried very hard to make a worthy remake of a classic comedy but it just didnt come together for me
Aug 13 2016,positive,very good is all im saying
Aug 13 2016,negative,awful terrible casting
Aug 13 2016,negative,not even worth getting on boot legged very sad that they thought to make 
Aug 13 2016,positive,i thought this was a good remake
Aug 13 2016,positive,i liked it it was fun to watch simple and actually really liked the story behind the first ghost the humor wasnt forced
Aug 13 2016,positive,thought it was hilarious the cast was great and had good chemistry i grew up with the originals which were funny for their time this is a solid remake with a talented cast i dont see how it has such poor ratings
Aug 13 2016,negative,mccarthy wiig and jones are great but a terrible script holds the movie back some of the dialogue is so bad it makes you cringe  wiig at one point says say hello to my little friend while firing a ghost gun of some kind     the film borrows way too much from the 2009 video game to the point where the special effects look like they were transplanted from a ps3     the final bad guy is possibly the most disappointing villain in movie history feig put so little thought into so many aspects of the film the natural talent of the cast cannot possibly overcome it     fun but forgetable
Aug 13 2016,positive,i didnt watch it so i dont know about the original ghost busters but i dont think this film is really bad its actually fun to watch
Aug 13 2016,negative,really tried to like this movie ignored all the bad news i fell asleep at the end this movie was so bad i could not stay awake no plot no story no acting no directing no idea whats going on characters with little or no motivation and worst of all no jokes
Aug 13 2016,positive,funny  dont go in expecting the original
Aug 13 2016,positive,best adult humorkids movie ive seen in a long time my 9 year old was a little scared in the beginning but enjoyed it after that would recommend for families with older children
Aug 13 2016,neutral,look this movie wasnt all that good but the cast did the best they could for what they were given to me i think leslie jones carried this movie dont get me wrong my darlings kristen wiig kate mckinnon and melissa mccarthy did a good job in this film but those four deserved a better script than this one but i laughed and i had a good time so i got my moneys worth
Aug 12 2016,positive,should have been a sequel to the original
Aug 12 2016,positive,extremely funny  sexy  nostalgic   eye candy  great action secuence   great soundtrack   great cast
Aug 12 2016,positive,i thought it was pretty funny im going to see it again while its in theatures
Aug 12 2016,positive,i just went to see the new ghostbusters movie and it was awesome i have always been a major fan of the movies ever since they first came out when i was a kid i totally wanted to be a ghostbuster and now to see how they remade the movie with women scientists was like geek heaven for me that movie was a work of art i loved the special effects and all the new gadgets i would have like to hear more science talk though it seems like they were holding back on the geek talk maybe its not for everyone but they didnt hold back in the other movies it was cool to see that the movies that were made in the late 80s and 90s they were always talking about making a business out of ghostbusting and charging high prices where in the new movie they were more interested in the science of it motivations were different for sure i really loved this movie and i think the original fans of ghostbusters would really appreciate what they did here i would like to see a second movie with the same characters so that we could get to know them a little bit better and watch them in a new adventure harold ramis would be happy to see this new version with all the modern effects i bet he had all kinds of ideas that couldnt happen because of the limited technology at the time all i can say is i am a huge fan the ghostbusters and i always will be what a great movie
Aug 12 2016,positive,eh i saw it it wasnt half bad actually haha couple funny parts the ghost parts were all cheesy and copoffs but whatever and some fun cameos even though ive never seen all the originals 2 of em i guess whatever fun fact kate mckinnon was born the year the 1st ghost busters came out i dont know who im giving these fun facts to im sure no one ever reads this stuff oh well maybe they do guess this is kinda public
Aug 12 2016,negative,what the garbage is this  
Aug 12 2016,positive,tried to hard for laughs when not needed not as bad as the boss but not great either better movies out now
Aug 12 2016,positive,its better than i thought it would be
Aug 12 2016,negative,it had some funny parts but about a lot more unfunny parts and a villain thats just an asshole not even evil
Aug 12 2016,negative,without a doubt this is the absolute worst movie ive seen in decades  the acting is so bad it hurts  the tiniest bit of life in the film is a few lines the black actress gives but the cast is as flat and boring as it gets  the effects are old and redundant and just a rehasha poor rehashof the original  even worse is the lamest cameos ever from the original cast of the movie  it was like none of them wanted to be there and the movie and couldnt wait to get away from it  most unconvincing and unfunny of all is chriss hemsworth  sad sad sad excuse for a movie  im blown away that the rt critics give this movie such a high rating  did they actually go to the movie or just watch the previews
Aug 12 2016,negative,the great cast couldnt save a trite and uninspired story forced potty humor and flat jokes that make this film an extended bad snl pun you wont cheer you wont laugh and you just might get turned off by the oversaturated color palette and tremendous product placement unless the horrid humor makes you walk away this couldve been a nice extension of the gb brand but it came out as a complete and utter disgrace
Aug 12 2016,negative,was not good at all very disappointing
Aug 12 2016,negative,three of the characters are okay but poorly scripted kate mckinnons role is an annoying misfire and chris hemsworths is single joke that fails every time    this unintentional tragedy wastes cameos by original cast members the story is incoherent and even ghostly characters are retreads that dont always stay true to who they were in the first film my face hurt afterward from the eyerolls and sneering induced by this bomb
Aug 12 2016,negative,the first one was only interesting because of the cast this wasnt that good for the same lack of appeal silly premise dull execution
Aug 12 2016,positive,great movie loads of fun and laughterwould definitely watch it again and purchase the film
Aug 12 2016,positive,this movie is hilarious
Aug 12 2016,positive,great moviebut they got a lot of old movies
Aug 12 2016,negative,no just no should not have reference the original if all it was going to be was a shit remake if instead they made it a film within the same universe as the original but just say that its a group from a different city and not just tried to copy the original in terms of characters it could have been so much better
Aug 12 2016,negative,pathetic  should have named it lesbobusters
Aug 12 2016,negative,this movie has a terrible script it had great and funny actresses but they had nothing to work with one of the biggest problems for ghostbusters 2016 is that it doesnt know when to be serious and when to be funny this ruined more than a few potentially terrifying scenes and soured some of the funny ones as for the humor itself it really didnt work for this movie it was just trying too hard and pushing the jokes too far and barely any of it felt natural i laughed maybe once or twice the entire movie i came in expecting a good movie like was advertised and found myself sorely disappointed
Aug 12 2016,negative,lazy keeping pretty much the same story  should have made a continuation like it was their kids
Aug 12 2016,positive,perfectly acceptable remake of the original unless you are named kevin in which case you might find it sexist  i enjoyed this more than i thought i would based on the reviews  if you go in with an open mind you will find an entertaining movie where a few of the jokes fall flat but for the most part it is delightfully silly
Aug 12 2016,positive,not the best movie i have seen but a lot of humor was funny to me during the movie but not all of it plus the mixture of action  comedy describes what a decent movie should be
Aug 12 2016,positive,a lot of pointlessly dumb stuff that could have been cut of course and a few too many tieins to the original however it was actually funny and entertaining overall which is basically the point lots of laugh out loud moments among the audience its kind of a chick flick but at least its a good one its an actionadventure chick flick comedy and there certainly arent many of those to choose from the cast seemed to be having fun with it and the effects were very well done  its unfortunate that it has to be compared to the original because it holds up well on its own merit
Aug 12 2016,negative,pandering to pc and sjw of the younger generations has no merit as entertainment
Aug 12 2016,negative,you dont have to be sexist to see how bad this movie is with special effects comparable to disneys haunted mansion or scooby doo and toilet humour all over the place you end up feeling like you wasted your money in a movie only a small kid would appreciate     so many moments felt as if the movie were yelling at us feel empowered women while playing stereotypical characters with stereotypical personalities     if youre a woman and wanna a see a kids movie with strong women characters youre better off watching brave or mulan ghostbusters 2016 is just a waste of your money and time
Aug 12 2016,neutral,a classic that required no reboot with any major plot changes to the detriment of the original and its loyal observances having been done better the first time around     maybe a better childfriendly introduction for the modern era but for those of the lesscensored youth the original excels in all regards
Aug 12 2016,positive,i like this movie dont listen to what people say its actually quite good the characters were funny as well as intriguing their chemistry also worked really well    there are some negative aspects of this movie granted all movies have those the special effects werent anything to brag about also some jokes fall flat    over all it was a good movie i enjoyed myself until the end and laughed on multiple occasions along with the rest of the theater
Aug 12 2016,positive,the cast with all the hatred from online trolls was hands down the best part of this movie and its nice to see that part of the movie succeed with holtzmann being the stand out the only issue is the movie lacks self control and is at its worst when special effects are present largely whiffing on visual gag humor in an all to amused with itself way when the girls are interacting with themselves the comedy works but falls off sharply whenever a ghost is on screen the synergy between the girls is the meat of this movie and positions it as an unmemorable movie with a memorable and likable cast
Aug 12 2016,negative,visually impressive with an amusing plot however its explicit misandrist view all men are stupid gay and stupid again makes it unwatchable for a movie which strives for equality this movie does a lot worse than the original it is stereotypical at times disgusting fart jokes en masse and utterly sexist   the movies has its high points esp visually and a great cast but the dialogue reveals the sexist attitudes of sony of the writers and that does not bode well for a movie which is aimed for the masses mind you half of it is male this is a movie about sexism and not ghostbusters  this could have been a great installment why reboot anyway with many nods towards original but in the end it was just a kick in the groin against all men oh yes and it is homophobic too
Aug 12 2016,negative,wow the socalled professional critics think this movie is better than suicide squad
Aug 12 2016,positive,this is my second favorite movie but i thought suicide squad is better
Aug 12 2016,positive,suprisingly amusing for a remake hommages to the original and the cameos could have been better though also it lacked a touch of scaryness the original had at times
Aug 12 2016,negative,terrible movie milo yiannopoulos was 100 right
Aug 12 2016,positive,badass and funny as hell couldnt have asked for a better new ghostbusters movie
Aug 12 2016,negative,this movie was a gigantic steaming pile of garbage soaked in gasoline and set on fire the actresses were trying waaaaay too hard to be funny and failed miserably the villain was the most boring and uninspired character with zero background or explanation the story was poorly edited as well
Aug 11 2016,positive,i liked it maybe not loved it but it was worth a night out the cast was great while i usually love kate mckinnon i found her performance more over the top than required i thought the cameos were fun
Aug 11 2016,negative,load of crap not funny not exciting not interesting save your time and money
Aug 11 2016,negative,poor jokes equally poor script the cast deserved better just hope its not repeated
Aug 11 2016,positive,hit or miss jokes and okay acting and definitely remakeworthy writing  eh its better than ghostbusters ii
Aug 11 2016,negative,so many people emotionally invested in this movie being successful and receiving great reviews wow what a let down this must have been for them still they will post their absurdly inflated reviews bottom line fine cast wasted with a scrip that falls flat melissa mccarthys worst film what a disaster
Aug 11 2016,positive,pretty much all of the negative reviews are from sexist ass wipes who havent even bothered to actually watch the movie for whatever reason they cant deal with a female cast  watch it its hilarious
Aug 11 2016,neutral,i thought it was a good movie they tried to continue with the original movies but fell a little short still worth watching if youre a ghost busters fan
Aug 11 2016,negative,good but not nearly as awesome as the original
Aug 11 2016,positive,doesnt improve over the original but most of the jokes are laughable and the action scenes are quite good overall its a very good looking and wellacted film
Aug 11 2016,negative,this movie gets a one not because it is a one but because the reviewers scores are so obviously biased this is a movie with so many obvious flaws and flat jokes that its deserving of a two or a three but since its all female we reviewers are inflating scores so i meet your inflation with deflation dishonesty shouldnt be tolerated  also thats how lackluster the movie is theres nothing to say about it just this controversy that has no reason to surround it this movie did nothing to earn it but have women
Aug 11 2016,positive,these comedians are so talented the characters are all so different and the jokes are original im gutted that more people didnt give this movie a chance more fool them for letting their sexism get in the way of seeing a brilliant movie
Aug 11 2016,positive,better then the original movie
Aug 11 2016,positive,very funny some of it was a little cheesy but then again so was the original so
Aug 11 2016,negative,i am a fan of the originals raised on them but i was looking forward to this simply because i enjoy movies and make a habit of ignoring reviews i genuinely enjoy watching most films i go see and i have seen  a lot    most of the problems with this movie are that it is trying too hard and has a terrible script very unfunny and the special effects are just cheap looking quite honestly  plus there are just too many holes in the script  im sorry but this is nearly 3 hours of my life i can never get back
Aug 11 2016,positive,this movie was funny and it had some of the original ghostbusters in it awesome movie
Aug 11 2016,positive,a genuinely funny take on the original with a wholly different comedic pace that goes for more consistently offbeat humor rather than the big zingers in the original  this style suits this new cast  the movie will bear repeated viewings when it comes out on dvd because you could watch it one time for each ghostbuster just to enjoy everything going on at the same time  this is especially true when it comes to mckinnon whose happy oddball character is alone worth the price of admission      the movie positively skewers the demographic that panned it before they even saw it by the way and it does so perfectly      the only bad thing about the movie is how it loses momentum when it lets go of being something new and tries to pay homage to the first ghostbusters movie  this movies strength was in the ensemble of four very talented comic actors who worked cooperatively for laughs and told a story of female friendship and experience  whenever the movie pivoted and tried to go big and flashy and actionmovielike i thought it got a lot weaker   i would have been happier with no big ghosts the size of a building  this movie didnt need to do that  the beauty of this film was in the details and i wish it would have stuck more to its strengths  still it was a hoot to see in the theater and i plan to buy it and watch it many times on bluray  sequels please
Aug 11 2016,positive,funniest movie ive seen since deadpool everytime holtmann or kevin was onscreen i was rolling in my seat with laughter
Aug 11 2016,negative,some entertainment value there but looking at it from an unbiased stand point due to being a big fan of the originals honestly the storyline was weak the graphics were average and the characters did their part in making the current young generation in never wanting to watch the better original movies
Aug 11 2016,positive,great cast great movie  dont hear to the haters  watch it yourself
Aug 11 2016,positive,we loved it  chuckled through the entire showing to a packed theater
Aug 11 2016,positive,love this movie if you guys want to watch a comedy than this is the movie for you it kind of tried to take itself serious but it couldnt just a good comedic movie
Aug 11 2016,positive,not as bad as i thought it was going to bebut not worth a sequel
Aug 11 2016,negative,all of the comic actors in the cast are hilarious just not in this particular film    dont get me wrong i didnt hate the movie  but i didnt like it either  i had to see it a second time before i felt like i could justify reviewing it because i didnt remember enough about it after the first viewing    heres the thing  its a pretty typical modern comedy  the humor is broad  the jokes are dumb  thats simply not my bag  the original ghostbusters and no i dont think you can review this movie without comparing it to the originalits a remake or a reboot whatever you want to call it but its trying to be a new version of the original wasnt a highbrow art house film but it also didnt contain a fart joke that immediately became a queef joke  it didnt include a character whose only defining trait was that he was as dumb as a brick    and it didnt have superfluous inconsequential characters that the scene lingers on simply because they were played by the actors in the original film  i mean obviously there was no original before the original but seriously this movie would have lost absolutely nothing if murray hudson and aykroyds cameos were scrapped  those scenes were pure fanservice because sony thought that pandering to our memories of the old movies would make us like this one  because they think were stupid  in some cases theyre probably rightim sure somebody out there thought that movie was good it had peter and ray and winston in it  but that person also probably laughed their ass off at the queef joke so its kind of a moot point    i guess that sort of person needs movies that cater to their tastes too  and i dont begrudge them this movie  they can have it  they can keep it
Aug 11 2016,negative,totally needless and  unfunny reboot 210
Aug 10 2016,positive,i found myself enjoying ghostbusters from start to finish definitely had its own identity while having plenty of nods to the originals the characters were likeable though some definitely more than others felt it flowed well and never felt bored once worth the price of admission as they say
Aug 10 2016,positive,i remember my first reaction when this film announced last year was its about time we ladies finally have our own heroes i deeply bow to the original 1984 ghostbusters  i love that movie so much my ringtone is the theme song  but this one has its own life i fell in love deeper with the ghostbusters
Aug 10 2016,negative,this movie is an insult to the original none of the characters are intelligent none of the humor is thought out or funny it is nothing more than a sjw feminist pan handle that is the very definition of why movies today are terrible     if the characters in this movie were anything like the original characters if the story well written this could had been a great movie instead it feels as though i am watching the script of a 12 year old daughter of some terrible feminist mother who threw her name on their kids script many of the scenes were borrowed from the original movie and has none of the creepy eeriness wonder or charm that the original had the plot was overly complicated and tremendously insipid     this is without a doubt the worst movie of 2016
Aug 10 2016,positive,it was awesome i took the kids to see it rented the first two to watch with them then took them to see it again they like it better than the original its like they took the layer of ghostbusters funny and added a layer of laugh out loud funny
Aug 10 2016,negative,what were they thinking
Aug 10 2016,positive,this was a highly entertaining romp through some familiar elements but this film definitely stands on its own merits the characters could truly be cared about and i consider this film a success i admit some of the cameos were hokey but that doesnt distract from the film
Aug 10 2016,positive,despite the critics prerelease its and excellent movie wont get you disappointed if youre a fan will be a great new experience if you didnt see the original i only hope they try to do something new and go on its own because they have a lot of potential
Aug 10 2016,positive,melissa and the saturday night girls were very funny with great chemistry i enjoyed how the original cast and many original props were introduced hemsworth was funny played a good character kate mckinnon is terrific
Aug 10 2016,neutral,i think the problem with movies today and i just heard about star trek discovery as an example is that were catering too much to the people who want women and gay people in more serious roles in hollywood i tend to agree but they are forcing the issue and overdoing their roles i guess in order to compensate for their views on how things should be this movie was just good enough to have a 50 on rotten tomatoes because although it was funny at many points it seemed forced and didnt flow as i think it could have i think making hemsworth an important character didnt help maybe if one of the ghostbusters was a brilliant male idiot or something this would have connected better mckinnon and jones were the only real funny ones in this movie the rest was definitely forced
Aug 10 2016,positive,my family loved it  we loved the way they approached the remake making it their taking some of the old and mixing it in it was clever and funny  as a matter of fact we saw it twice  the women ghostbusters were funny and smart  and you could watch with your family
Aug 10 2016,positive,a lot better movie than what i expected it to bethe movie has charm for both adults and young audiences
Aug 10 2016,negative,just crap nothing but stupid humor and not remotely entertaining miss mccarthy should be sad
Aug 10 2016,positive,i adore this movie  my new favorite 
Aug 10 2016,positive,true to the spirit of the original refreshing take on the franchise
Aug 10 2016,positive,the best attitude to have when rebooting a franchise like this is to not take yourself too seriously and that was paul feigs biggest strength in making this movie the story manages a nice degree of originality and homage creating a nostalgicallycharged new experience while there are a few bits of the movie that become slow and less humorous the cast largely holds it all together with their individual brands of humor that compliment each other very well
Aug 10 2016,positive,this movie was great it had strong women a hilarious story i will admit the theme song wasnt as strong as the original but there wasnt a moment of this movie that fell flat a must see for sure this movie invoked a lot of the same feelings the original two did and i hope they continue to make more at this same caliber
Aug 10 2016,positive,a fantastic switch of roles that always manages to upset fragile masculine egos  an instant classic i remember leaning to my friend while watching and whispering harshly i love this fucking movie i want to watch again
Aug 10 2016,positive,very nice movie kate mckinnon killed it
Aug 10 2016,positive,partially to counteract the haters partially because this movie makes me super happy oh holtzman you are so awesome
Aug 10 2016,positive,great movie do not try compare it to the originals let is stand on its own
Aug 10 2016,positive,didnt expect much but was pleasantly surprised    changed enough to make it interesting    the gb team was excellent     thumbs up
Aug 10 2016,negative,00005100    receiving a bad comedy is one of the hardest things to do as there are only so many times you can say its not funny  nostalgia critic    how true that is to be honest i dont know what this movie was trying to achieve so i called it a comedy because both areas fail so bad i chose the one that failed less    comedy is this a comedy or a horror film honestly the humor is too raunchy to be funny its not funny saying cuss words or waving middle fingers around or acknowledging farts exist isnt funny playing around with the lesbian idea is done a lot and its not done well this film thrives on humor mentioned above and the awkward protagonist cliche it makes scenes drag on forever with awkward silence and no jokes one of the ladies the blonde one whatever her name is is raunchy for the sake of being raunchy thats her entire character not funny adding to the trashyness is the constant mocking of a mentally disabled man who signed up to be their secretary its just pathetic not funny    horror as will be stated later the main horror in this film is inyourface jumpscares that get really old really fast not scary not funny    age rating inappropriate yes these are teens but a 14 rating is needed he constant cursing and our villain a mentally disturbed man kills himself on screen by means of electrocution after being found out as the villain every second this character was on screen was uncomfortable and awkward we see his drawing after the fact and we see the true range of his insanity its truly sad and not funny    acting ranging from poor and lifeless to over acting there is no in between the african american woman is too stereotypical not funny i may add and over acts and reacts to everything the other characters are lifeless and plain no effort was put into the rules to make it good or funny    plot holey and not in the jesus way bill murrays character as an enemy of our four ladies if you can call them that is incorrect if you want to have cameos fine then make all of them relative and have them remember or none at all some of the original cast remembers the events and bill murray does not it doesnt make sense he saw the ghosts too why is he denying them  and just disappears halfway through the film never to be seen again same with most everything things never mentioned before ie needed weapons and mechanics appear out of nowhere very coincidental not funny    cgi baaaaaad any semblance of talent is taken away having strange and offlooking characters not scary just strange also be prepared to be annoyed as the film is constantly inyourface having things being thrown in your face and tooclose ups if you want to see cgi done right watch the goosebumps movie it will be much more enjoyable     stereotypes   the government is hiding things never trust it  black women are soooo sassy mhm  mentally challenged people are all insane so stay away from them but you can mock them as much as you like    notes    if you want to put transitions in a movie go ahead but go full out not just one that will leave you dazed and confused    im going to go more into the characters they are much too mean spirited to be funny and their sad backstories dont make you feel anything for them i hated the way they mocked and ridiculed the mentally challenged in this movie it was displayed so poorly that it hurt the cause    this movie makes you wait through poor dialogue and acting for no payoff just the end of the movie its trying to be hip and cool but fails on every level not worth watching the original had better effects than this    final word this is a truly horrid film with bad taste as the main flavor it sickened me it was so wrong i wouldnt recommend it to anyone if you want ghostbusters go see the original
Aug 10 2016,positive,ghostbusters suffers from previous outings obvious first the original 1984 classic then the previous paul feig productions incredible bridesmaids forgettably entertaining the heat surprisingly great spy helps getting the dirty job done   if you try to keep away the past and look at the present you get a comedy that can stand on its own for the most part  and that badly cracks under the weight of bad special effects neither disastrous or revolutionary ghostbusters has a great cast not always well handled fine oneliners and a will to please people   look at the past and you will get a big pile of nothing
Aug 10 2016,positive,it was very okay i liked the cast a great deal especially kate mckinnon some of the jokes hit and some of the jokes missed the pace was a wee bit inconsistent which may have lead to some of the gags not hitting as well there are a lot of ignorant assholes on the net who want nothing to do with this film but i would be up for a sequel in a couple years
Aug 10 2016,positive,as a old school ghosthead i am very happy to have taken the time to see this movie on the big screen no it is nothing like the original it is neither better not is it worse it doesnt even try to be the original but it does do is hold onto what it means to be a ghostbuster it is a great movie to watch there will never be any who can go toe to toe with the original four this is a great first step in picking up the franchise and bringing the ghost corps to the big screen thank you sony thank you ghost corps and thank you cast and crew for allowing this ghosthead to revisit his childhood
Aug 10 2016,positive,lots of funny oneliners very amusing romp
Aug 10 2016,positive,funny these women killed it
Aug 10 2016,negative,the first joke in the movie is a vaginal fart joke i fake laughed out loud so i didnt pass as a dirty misogynist
Aug 10 2016,positive,its not nearly as bad as people let on  i get it i grew up with ghostbusters and would have preferred a soft reboot eg the characters from the original were the same and not cameos sprinkled throughout it was a fun film though a few things could have been different  the fun the first time around was that the villain was unexplainable really and was supernatural  the villain this time was a run of the mill disenfranchised geek who manipulated the supernatural  the big action piece was fun  i like the fact they kept the general look and feel of the original  i did genuinely enjoy the characters and would have looked forward to another  not as good as original but not as bad as the hatred suggests
Aug 10 2016,negative,poor script useless reboot unscaryunfunny ghosts mckinnon is great but not used enough
Aug 10 2016,positive,kate mckinnon crushed it
Aug 10 2016,positive,safety lights are for dudes
Aug 10 2016,positive,its an absolute blast perfect summer movie fun that captures the goofy spirit of the original while putting the awesome comedic talents of its cast to great use the casting is really key heresome diehard fans of the 1984 original seem incapable of imagining a ghostbusters movie without the old crew who actually do pop up in respectful yet distracting cameos that were better left on the cutting room floor but you couldnt ask for a funnier quartet than melissa mccarthy kristin wiig kate mckinnon and leslie jones the real fun of this movie is the natural chemistry between these ladies and the comedic interplay that peppers the film throughout add a game chris hemsworth as their knuckleheaded receptionist plus primo comedy writerdirector paul fieg behind the camera and youve got yourself a winning combination forget everything youve read or heard about this movie including that first trailer which was indeed pretty terrible and just give into its considerable charms
Aug 10 2016,negative,this deserve the crap rating it got if anything people wanted a blow for blow remake of the original film same character same story retold not some stupid girl power perversion of a cult classic
Aug 10 2016,neutral,someone took the cast of bridesmaids and put it in a movie about ghosts meh the low brow humor had my kids laughing but it was generally uneven and only leslie jones seemed to do any work in this movie nice cameos but generally nothing new here
Aug 10 2016,negative,just wow i was so not into this movie when it comes to ghostbusters i will personally stick to the original movies this wasnt ghostbusters it had some of the feel but not enough to save it i watched it out of curiosity  but i doubt i will ever watch it again just was not good in my opinion
Aug 10 2016,negative,ghostbustines is the hillary clinton of comedy movies the 4 ladybusters are extremely stupid and have no common sense especially that annoying bitch kate mckinnon the ladybusters think being in charge of saving the world has to do with womens rights and the ladybusters say stupid irritating weakminded blabber the whole time like is it the wig or the hat lets go  lets go  oh did you want to say it ill let you ill let you next time the power of pain compels you i said cute cute im glad this movie bombed the box office maybe that can dissuade or make sony unable to afford making any sequels of this oh and also because you dont deserve payday if you do a horrible job and by you i mean paul feig kristen wiig kate mckinnon chris hemsworth melissa mccarthy and leslie jones the worst of those 6 was kate
Aug 10 2016,positive,yall are hater it was great
Aug 10 2016,negative,we went and saw this last weekend  i love snl and i love the actresses and most of the cast  and then theres the plotwhich basically doesnt exist  this is a terrible waste of time and i truly thought an allfemale cast would make this an awesome movie to see  i loved kate mckinnon but her character was only about as deep as a packet of ketchup  clearly the directorproducer team was just trying to score some quick cash because they made a real bad one here  laughed at a few parts but the story was pitiful  also sorry for the spoiler but a canvas ghostbuster man that basically was the same effect as the staypuft marshmallow man  what a terrible decision  next time use some creativity and please stop ruining classics
Aug 10 2016,positive,i had very low expectations for this movie it surprised me very much it wasnt as bad as i thought it was going to be it still should have be gb3 not a remake because you cannot compete with a classic 610
Aug 10 2016,positive,i know that this wasnt a huge hit still they did a really good job they have a great cast and my new female hero is jillian holtzmann character she was just great the laser whip was amazing chris hemsworth was funny to no end playing the dumb secretary they paid homage to the original cast members and having cameos through out the movie
Aug 10 2016,negative,the best part of the movie end credits
Aug 10 2016,positive,this film does not deserve nearly as much hate as it got i get it wasnt like the original but i like the way it brought a fresh spin on the franchise with a hilarious allfemale cast who obviously had great chemistry worth the see
Aug 10 2016,positive,this movie was great i loved it the humor was on point the special effects were spectacular the characters were unique distinct and motivated i want more
Aug 10 2016,negative,an obvious remake just to have an all woman cast
Aug 10 2016,positive,pleasantly surprised by this movie this was a fun movie and i enjoyed the banter between all the characters its not a revolutionary movie that will change comedies it is hilarious and deserves more respect than its getting
Aug 10 2016,positive,it looks like they ran out of money after foolishly releasing a feministlooking trailer  the cgi is appalling and the film has less scenes in it than the original  holtzmann is my favourite ghosbuster and made me laugh in every scene she was in  other parts had overlong monologues that werent very funny seemingly trying to be seinfeld  well worth watching though
Aug 10 2016,positive,my son and i enjoyed ghostbusters i enjoyed the references back to the original movie
Aug 10 2016,positive,in this femalefocused reboot of the beloved 80s comedy we join a group of scientists in their paranormal pursuits to rid manhattan of its ghostly hauntings once again erin gilbert wiig has spent much of her career trying to get away from her past and paranormal interests whereas her one time partner abby yates mccarthy has channeled her energies into creating a range of contraptions that might prove their theories once and for all when their paths cross and a local business asks for help getting rid of a spirit erin and abby join forces with the help of engineer jillian holtzmann mckinnon and subway worker patty tolan leslie jones to kick all manner of ghostly butt    first off i had my doubts along with everyone else who treasures the original and saw that trailer my major trepidation was it going to be funny within the first few minutes and introductory character sequences i was fully settled in and my immediate concerns were totally levitated its a different form of comedy from the original  because comedy itself has also changed over time and with its performers i laughed out loud pretty consistently for the duration and thats a testament to the high caliber of comedic talent on screen  our four leading ladies i welcomed my old favorites kristen wiig and melissa mccarthy with open arms also i may have developed a ladycrush on kate mckinnon who steals the show on numerous occasions    the inevitable smallminded and misogynist reviews ive heard are thoroughly undeserved because as it turns out the female cast are its strongest asset the film itself makes several hilarious jabs at exemplar sexist comments the rolereversal of chris hemsworths character kevin  a dumb receptionist serving as eye candy  is refreshing hilarious and a true delight with a few crafty thor gags for good measure there are a few expected cameos to look out for along the way both cast members and paranormal favorites the best of which are used sparingly     theres a particular focus where the writings concerned to stay faithful to the original which though understandable actually works to its detriment go figure the sense of fidelity is very strong throughout which limits its creativity and originality as a reboot for me some more distance might have served for a better overall story to get out of its looming shadow hey at least its not a shotforshot remake i would have also benefited from some further development and variation of the ghostly apparitions all of which take a very similar form the final act falls a little flat when the comedy drops to make way for the cgi ghost busting action sequences utilizing the various contraptions the ladies have been building throughout the flick     the bulk of the new ghostbusters is something i can get on board with  a female driven and centered comedy with plenty of chuckles and satire the minor grumbles that i have about the narrative and the final act dont spoil the movie as a whole but rather reflect my concerns with most rebootsremakessequels in general
Aug 10 2016,negative,after watching this i conclude that any critic finding this movie above average is a critic without any intellectual capabilities nor any standards what an unfunny mess this movie is
Aug 10 2016,negative,cant believe they replaced the cast with women for this reboot
Aug 10 2016,negative,terrible cheap unwatchable jokes not worth the time
Aug 10 2016,positive,the original does not hold dear to me so allow this film to stand on its own merit
Aug 9 2016,positive,a lot of people were put off by melissa mccarthys casting as she tends to play nearly identical characters but this was really different the script was clever chris hemsworth had me dying in his first scene and they didnt create flat characrers there was no lazy comedy no fat jokes or period jokes or anything of that sort there was genuine wit every character had her purpose the only qualm i have is that the final dramatic push just before the resolution seemed unnecessary and poorly executed in addition if someone is watching this without a lot of knowledge of the original movies at times it can seem like one os missing out on a few jokes and even minor plot points like in the after credits scene but from an overall standpoint script casting and especially the visual effects this is a really good reboot
Aug 9 2016,positive,it wasnt as funny ad i expected but it was okay i would have rather saved my money and waited to watch on blu ray at home
Aug 9 2016,negative,the writing and editing were so bad that even the original cast couldnt have put out this dumpster fire
Aug 9 2016,negative,bad writing bad acting  bad story mix in the mass amounts of misandry and feministsjw agenda shoved down your throat and you will vomit usually you have to visit tumblr to see so much male demonizing and sexism
Aug 9 2016,negative,the good scenes were better than i expected but the bad scenes were so much worse than i expected  i couldve respected this movie so much more if they didnt start off with fart jokes followed by slapstick and if they didnt rip off the first 2 movies so hard  i also found the script to be lacking any memorable lines or witty comebacks  leslie jones was worth seeing but the other main characters just fell flat  i found many of the side characters that you only see once to be the best parts of the movie dean of the college metal band etc  i would not recommend wasting the money to see this in theaters
Aug 9 2016,positive,loved it for me its not how it compares to the original because nothing should ever try to replace anything but how it stands alone it stands well
Aug 9 2016,negative,really tried to like this movie but alas it was pretty horrible i had hopes  that maybe i wouldnt agree with my friends on how horrible it is came in with a positive attitude and for the first 30 minutes i was pleasantly surprised a few good laughs nice intro of the characters and i was thinking this isnt so bad then of course it went bad the script and jokes turned to garbage pretty quick very cheesy and lots of product placement and the jokes were very pedestrian the cameos were a nice touch and kate mckinnon i gave the extra half star because of her was the best of the group the finale was amazingly lame with zero excitement even my son was like it was ok and he is pretty easy to please if the movie has action and jokes
Aug 9 2016,negative,id give zero if i could huge fan of the originals in fact the original is my all time favorite movie id honestly watch anything with dan aykroyd in it so i unfortunately gave this movie a try now let me start off by saying im not sexist or misogynistic  though ill be accused of it amyway i wasnt opposed to an all female cast it didnt bother me rebooting it however did because to me theres no reason to reboot a perfect film and to me ghostbusters is perfect because theres no way you can touch the original and this one certainly didnt     its a good thing they can label all deteactors as sexist because at least that way they have an excuse for all the hate this movie has been getting believe me  the movie deserves it     what we get is an awful reboot the plot was way too rushed the villain came literally out of thin air and the cameos  which feig added last second to try and sway the fan base hes been insulting and isolating were pissed poor at best to see bill murray in any other role besides peter venkman is an atrocity     this movie lacks then on screen chemistry of the original as well as its witty humor i felt as if they were all trying to one up each other as opposed to working together the effects reminded me of those god awful scoobydoo live action movies which are far better than ghostbusters 2016 chris hemsworth character was literally brainless and he was the highlight he had me laugh once melissa mccarthy was cringe worthy she just fell absolutely flat my favorite part of the movie was the end credits    sony fired 6 marketing executives because of this movie 150000000 in marketing and another 150 million in production     suicide squad scored 23 and was phenomenal how this is certified fresh is beyond me    people are saying red box it or rent it my advice just avoid it like the plague
Aug 9 2016,positive,i loved the original ghostbusters and i totally enjoyed this reboot excited for a possible sequel
Aug 9 2016,negative,i want that one hour and fifty seven minutes of my life back usually a complaint like that would be rude and snarky but no this is a desperate plea because i am genuinely upset with myself because i wasted so much time on this utter tripe not worth the time or money spent and now i feel the need to reevaluate several life choices
Aug 9 2016,positive,okay so i just finished the new ghostbusters movie and i can see how some people can find something to boohoo about but i went in with an open mind for a new story and i think its pretty damn good considering everyone being little bitches about it     sure everyone is entitled to their opinion but remember that is their opinion just as this is mine do not let others tell you that something is terrible without finding out for yourself i mean they can bitch about the mayor but thats how the government handles it they can bitch about hemsworth but thats his character and there are those kinds of people in the world and they can bitch about it being four women doing it but dudethe originals are old as shit or dead    just enjoy a movie and quit comparing stories there are similar elements there are differences you want to bitch the new star wars did exactly this basically the same movie as a new hope just watch it before you judge ghostbusters gets a 810 from me and a whole point came from the foreshadowing at the end of the credits btw watch all the way to the end of the credits
Aug 9 2016,positive,not sure why users rated this low i enjoyed the movie the newly developed weapons were pretty darn cool
Aug 9 2016,positive,not all jokes landed but a very fun movie overall great cameos by the old cast
Aug 9 2016,negative,i really wanted to like this film i tried i wanted to be able to say its a worthy remake  it has its moments here and there but overall it just wasnt that good  most of the performances seemed forced and stilted and the characters too much like bad caricatures  the storyline seemed like it was poorly planned around a bunch of schtick that someone had decided they wanted to be included  the sfx were fine but thats about the nicest thing i can say  im glad i had a free matinee movie rewards coupon to use on this so that all i wasted was my time  unfortunately this remake just doesnt hold a candle to the 1984 original
Aug 9 2016,negative,im not going to lie near the end before the final fight i totally fell asleep
Aug 9 2016,negative,if only they were naked
Aug 9 2016,negative,its not worth paying the movie ticket more like to watch on netflix
Aug 9 2016,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed this movie it was very nostalgic with lots of references to the original movie without going overboard the cgi was fantastic it made the ghosts pretty scary at times it was action packed and absolutely hilarious i personally enjoyed it far more than the originals as i could not stand the whole damsel in distress thing and this movie showed just how ridiculous female stereotypes can be by giving a male character the dumb attractive receptionist role
Aug 9 2016,positive,just finished watching the new ghost busters movie  felt like bad fan fiction normally i love melissa mccarthy and leslie jones but not a fan of the movie  there were a couple funny parts but other things fell flat  not sure we the had so many bodily function jokes right at the beginning cameos and special effects were cool but just not a quality remake 3 out of 5 stars  didnt hate it with a passion more of a meh reaction
Aug 9 2016,positive,i loved it it felt fun all the way through
Aug 9 2016,positive,its a good time dont compare enjoy
Aug 9 2016,positive,hilarious i laughed the whole time
Aug 9 2016,neutral,before i voice my utter disappointment in this one let me preface that i am a fan of the casting  its the 21st century and if a woman can be president then she sure as shit can bust ghosts     what i wasnt a fan of was the lack of general story which tends to be important in film this is the first miss for feig and you can feel the studio grasps sucking out any originality that this reboot might have had    a roadhouse joke does not make a good film i suggest you watch roadhouse instead much funnier
Aug 9 2016,negative,the characters are bland the humor seems forced and overall its not a good filmits that kind of film where you have to get drunk or get high to watch it with a group of people and constantly rant about it and have fun 2 stars for the ridiculousness and also the vfx and cgi are not bad
Aug 9 2016,positive,it was a hilarious movie to which the comedy was brilliantly written to be androgynous so that both genders can appreciate it i thought the characters were original compared to the first gb and i think the nods to the original were well done     sometimes the comedy tried too hard but overall i enjoyed it start to finish     personal note i found it really empowering and i loved the role reversals they did with chris hemsworth so good
Aug 9 2016,positive,with ridiculously low expectations this movie was pleasantly surprising fun for the most part with lots of good laughs there is also some really dumb stuff but it is enjoyable for the most part chris hemsworths character was hilarious 1 viewing
Aug 9 2016,neutral,i actually saw a preview screening of this back in december and prefer that original cut
Aug 9 2016,positive,stayed true to form including the few plot holes like the guy at the beginning
Aug 9 2016,positive,ignore the haters stuck in the past this is far better than the original which is good
Aug 9 2016,negative,it is a sexist movie they just hate on men
Aug 9 2016,neutral,the comedy in this film was sooo boring and predictable social commentary related to this aside this was supposed to be a fun reboot of a classic and just plain and simple it wasnt i dont care who the cast is if its supposed to be a comedy and the writing is flat and boring acting is basic and then you throw in predictable stereotypestropes it typically just makes for an unpleasant viewing experience
Aug 9 2016,positive,i liked it a lot more than expected people should check it out for themselves for sure very funny and the effects are great
Aug 9 2016,positive,funny oh so funny ladies did an amazing job chris hemsworth and all the cameos were brilliant i will be more than happy to put this dvd next to the original ghostbusters
Aug 9 2016,negative,this movie is terrible  the effects are reminisce of scooby doo live action films the acting is wooden and the comedy i keep seeing referred to is dull predictable and over scripted i thought i would give it a go seeing as though the reviews initially were coming in relatively good however it just seems some people are terrified of airing their true opinion or simply see this as an opportunity to assert their allegiance to any tedious links to postmodern feminism  this film doesnt push that agenda it hampers it through trying to recycle an existent formula and push a female cast into it  the notion that this is better than the originals is sadly deluded i am almost absolutely confident that the cult following of the original films will not be seen with this film  just look at the box office figures  poor through and through
Aug 9 2016,negative,i know i aint seen it so it sucks just look at the trailer
Aug 8 2016,neutral,instead of being a good action movie like the originals it was more like a comedy
Aug 8 2016,positive,this movie was one of the best i have seen in a long time it was funny different and had a smartass feel witch i like alot overall they did a good job with the cast love the characters in this movie
Aug 8 2016,negative,most disappointing franchise reboot since robocop
Aug 8 2016,negative,this movie is a landmark not only it killed the sjw movement it also drove the feminist movement into a hatred dead end and cause hillary clinton to lose the 2016 election how could it be possible is it that bad  oh yes it is bad you have no idea how bad it is it is a manhating manifesto with bed jokes disrespect with the original movie characters and specially the audience  it marks the moment mankind woke up to hollywood evil agendas and manipulations it marks the moment the world realized hollywood thinks we are all idiots that consume whatever is offered to us it bombed it flopped and it was well deserved
Aug 8 2016,negative,if i time travel i will kill hitler and whoevers idea it was to make this movie
Aug 8 2016,negative,this movie was not worth entry cast seemed to no click and seemed the director is better doing his original comedy this movie is on par with ghostbusters ii  and i feel that was a horrible copy and paste of the first movie  these actresses have talent just seems the script and actors were phoning it in imho i would say this is not worth entry at a theater if you want to see it watch it at a 2nd run theater also how is this movie fresh on this site these critics on this site are idiots
Aug 8 2016,negative,terriblejust terrible not funny at all
Aug 8 2016,negative,much has been said about the misogynists who trashtalked this film these sexist comments are unfortunate as it has distracted from objective reviews of the movie and made it difficult to give an honest opinion i shall attempt to tell it like it is from my vantage point this movie is a mediocre rehash of the original where just like in star wars ep viii it lifted a number of scenes from it but didnt do them as well it seems to have fallen victim to other movies trying to capture nostalgic feelings such as dumb and dumber to where it was more concerned with giving shoutouts to the past  and dumbing down the script to appeal to a mass audience  than actually making a good movie the result was a mess going back to claims of sexism the real sexism here is that the producers gave four talented women crap to work with
Aug 8 2016,negative,crap writing acting casting  an extra side of crap also for desert  more crap
Aug 8 2016,positive,paul feigs ghostbusters remake was actually pretty gooduntil it wasnt with a runtime of nearly 2 hours filled with tons of laughs great cast chemistry and a healthy dose of fun creepiness the first 90 minutes seemed like 60 but shockingly the final 30 seemed like 90 for some reason losing all momentum during its final actionpacked sequence that said this was still better than bridesmaids    read the rest of my review     follow me on twitter moviesmarkus
Aug 8 2016,negative,the movie looks bad
Aug 8 2016,negative,ugh  i can see why they had to force bill murray to endorse this under threat of legal action
Aug 8 2016,positive,i dont normally go in for remakes but this one was done right i loved it took the original and gave it some steroids great to see them bring all the living original cast in for a cameo
Aug 8 2016,negative,for all its efforts to turn the franchise into womancentered entertainment this reboot cant stop reminding you of how derivative it is of the original the cameos were incessant and the infranchise references eg slimer got to be unbearable the only genuinely original thing about this movie was kate mckinnons character she owned that role and made you forget it was based on egon
Aug 8 2016,negative,actually decently made and not nearly as bad as the trailers let on if i saw this without ever having seen the original i might give it three stars but now its just a tired rehash of something already perfected 30 years ago
Aug 8 2016,positive,the reboot for ghost busters wasnt as bad as i had feared when i heard so many complaining apperantly there really are a lot of sexist pigs out there the movie itself as a whole was mediocre it still keeps the campy aura of what ghost busters is suppose to be give this movie a chance if you havent had a shot to watch this because of naysayers
Aug 8 2016,positive,grade  b  in a nutshell some of the funny women of saturday night live including 4 time guest host of snl melissa mccarthy star in this reboot of the 1984 smash hit    the beloved original which i loved is hard to beat but this version gives it a respectable shot    written and directed by paul feig this movie isnt as good as you want but also not as bad as you thought it would be    uplifting theme     no woman should walk around unarmed  jillian  the purpose of life is to love  jillian  female empowerment  things i liked    cameos and references from the fantastic cast of the original movie  terrific cast includes melissa mccarthy kristen wiig kate mckinnon leslie jones chris hemsworth and cecily strong  keep watching during the final credits for a peek at the sequel  at the end of the movie it says for harold ramis  a lot of people dont realize that he died in 2014  chris hemsworth  youll laugh out loud at least a couple of times  the action sequences are better than the original thanks to new movie technology  i thought zach woods comments as the tour guide at the very beginning of the movie were really funny  things i didnt like    it doesnt have quite the charm as the original  does this reboot add anything new to the original  no not really  oh yeah chris hemsworth  the script didnt allow these comediennes to really knock our socks off  the material just isnt as good as they are  every male character in this movie is either an idiot or a jerk  although this film isnt the greatest ever made it certainly doesnt deserve all the hate that has been spewing over it online  the villain isnt anything special or memorable  funny lines     something big is gonna happen  erin  the word were looking for is apocalypse  jillian    that is a deadly high five   abby  so i dont know if its a race thing or a lady thing but im mad as hell  patty  how can you be eating right now  erin gilbert  try saying no to these salty parabolas  jillian holtzmann    am i on crack or is this a good logo  jillian  thats where i saw that weird sparking thing  patty tolan  what was it  erin    if i knew what it was i wouldnt say weird sparking thing  patty    why am i using the untested nuclear thing  erin  you have the longest arms  jillian    ah its always the sad pale ones  jillian  you hate to see the smart ones go bad  jillian  you guys this is exactly how i pictured my death  jillian  whos the flying beefcake  rourke  what year is it  abby  its 2040  our president is a plant  jillian    im just looking for a reasonable ratio between wontons and broth  this is absolute madness  abby  it transports ghosts and i dont know where but i think its michigan   safety lights are for dudes  jillian  tips for parents     a lot of crude jokes  some of the ghosts could be frightening for small children  some profanity  lots of slime which your kids will love
Aug 8 2016,positive,i love this movie kate mckinnon is the new face of awesome ive seen it twice in theaters and cant even pinpoint why i love it so much its an excellent cast and i found the humor both enjoyable and none too crass i am a supporter of this new ghostbusters 
Aug 8 2016,negative,this movie is so lame its like they made this movie for 9 year old girls who read garfield all day and dont have friends in their own town just pen pals from girl scout camp its so corny even dads will groan at the lame excuse for humor in this film im a woman but even i enjoy an aesthetically pleasing and talented cast the women in this film are so homely unbearable dorky  criminally frumpy no just no
Aug 8 2016,positive,dont listen to naysayers this is a fun summer blockbuster if you get a chance to see it you will not be disappointed   excellent reboot of a classic movie its fun and refreshingly free of the tired cliches of an allwoman cast   it doesnt get bogged down with tributes or idolatry but still has great references to original films  franchise the graphics are stylistically consistent with the mood of the film and are very well done   leslie jones and kate mckinnon bring amazing and original performances melissa mccarthy and kristen wiig are theyre usual nerdy selves   the plot is predictable but the mainly adlibbed performances make up for it chris hemsworth is very funny
Aug 8 2016,positive,itll never be the classic the original was but the new ghostbusters is actually good id be up for a sequel
Aug 8 2016,negative,was probably the biggest letdown this year so far not bad but definitely not good
Aug 8 2016,positive,great reimagination i usually hate missy macarthy however the combo plus the lovely mister hemsworth dont miss his dancing in the credits
Aug 8 2016,negative,its just not very good thats pretty much it
Aug 8 2016,positive,hilarious movie perfect for those who grew up with the originals
Aug 8 2016,positive,ups and downs the first half had a lot of very solid jokes in it good ghosts the ending was a bit unexciting to cgi for my tastes overall though i liked it and would watch it again
Aug 8 2016,negative,somebody paid off the critics on this one  shame on you
Aug 8 2016,negative,this movie had a great start and then just went haywire its as if they were so busy trying to fit in cameo opportunities for the previous cast that the show fell apart i think the actors did what they could but this was horribly boring either 1 do an actual remake or 2 do a new story on the old premise but do not try to combine it and let the story fall into pieces
Aug 8 2016,negative,you know i have no problem with females becoming ghostbusters i have a problem that this film didnt need to be remade at all and that fact that they remade this as bad as they did yeah i have a problem with that this movie stars 4 funny women and paul feig is directing this movie youd think that this movie would at least be somewhat funny right nope instead you get over the top characters that try so hard to be funny and just arent what makes it even more funny is that this film got a 73 on rotten tomatoes guess those critics didnt want to be called sexist or something stupid like that this film is got so much controversy around it and im not so sure why feminists have taken a giant movement to make sure if you dont like this movie youre a bigot sexist for no reason but thats just them this movie isnt funny its not fun it feels like a video game at the end when they are taking on the ghosts my favorite part is when the bust a ghost they bust one ghost out of the whole movie and that was the funniest and best part sad i wanted this movie to be good too instead next time when you make a movie involving women dont make it seem like they need to prove something woman have been badass in movies for decades look at aliens who owns that series a woman who is the stand out star in mad max fury road a woman so on and so on woman are awesome so stop trying to make sure they have to prove something
Aug 8 2016,positive,absolute epic movie one of the best films ive seen in a long time and thats saying a lot a few jumpy moments here and there so for the younger audience it could scare them if you are a fan of the original then you will love this even if you are not then ghostbusters is a film the hole family will love
Aug 8 2016,negative,way worse than the original many scenes were just plain stupid for my taste
Aug 8 2016,positive,i loved the original ghostbusters but i loved this ghostbusters movie just as much the people that seem to not appreciate it though probably was expecting this movie to live up to the original but thats not a bad thing that it didnt it became a unique experience as well     one thing though i am glad they cut a specific scene and left it out for the credit song i was talking with my mom and if they left this specific scene out it would have lowered this rating down due to the cheesiness of that scene
Aug 8 2016,positive,this all girl cast was laughoutloud funny and thoroughly entertaining i recommend this movie for everyone
Aug 8 2016,negative,i was honestly disappointed at this movie the mediocre humor and horror was tiring and not funny nor scary  the movie was so high on computer animation that it is honestly a disgrace to say its a reboot or  in the same universe as the old ghostbusters  movies the old one did a lot of it with computer animation too yes but they used it right and made everything look amazing and made things fun this movie is so heavy on cgi that i honestly didnt feel like it sucked me in as the old one did i am actually surprised that in my eyes half way into the movie i got bored
Aug 8 2016,positive,ghostbusters is most controversial and the most talked about movie of the year right up there with batman v superman its the most disliked trailer on youtube and also features maybe the worst marketing ive ever witnessed for a film now im saying this now the first 1984 film is one of my all time favorite comedies and films in general i love the first film and going into this i was really hoping it was going to be a good movie so whats the result is this a good film not necessarily the first half of the film is stronger than the second it has the worst villain of the year and the constant cameos and references to the old film got really old really fast but that being said i was entertained throughout the course of the film to my surprise i found myself laughing throughout the course of the film mostly through mckinnon jones and surprising from a great comedic performance by hemsworth whos fantastic i also found that the four ghostbusters all had a few great individual moments at one point or another and had really good chemistry as well its a sloppy film for sure but its defiantly not one of the worst movies ever made like how some people are making it out to be
Aug 8 2016,positive,some genuine laughoutloud moments kate mckinnon was made for the role and really stood out also chris hemsworth really added to the comedy factor the cameos made by some of the original movie stars were good
Aug 8 2016,positive,there were a lot of really good laughs throughout this film if you go into it knowing that it isnt the original it really is enjoyable
Aug 8 2016,negative,what a complete mess of a movie
Aug 8 2016,positive,loved ghostbusters  funny smart sassy and the fight sequence at the end was amazing in 3d
Aug 8 2016,positive,this was a lot of fun i wasnt expecting to like this as much as i did be sure to watch all the way to the end
Aug 8 2016,negative,half star what in the actual fk they ruined ghostbusters with this left wing hollywood feminist bs
Aug 8 2016,negative,it was certainly better than i had expected it was funny brash and silly except as it exploded to its conclusion i realized what the empty feeling inside me was there was absolutely no reason to make this movie except to cash in on a beloved franchise     if there was a plot it was well hidden beneath layers of slap stick humour and cameos  from the far superior original as the movie wore on it became evident that this was only an homage to a great film and not actually a great film
Aug 8 2016,positive,i have one problem with this movie where the heck did the villain come from there was nothing for him he just shows up with the most basic background ever and causes chaos i expected them to be like the original movies and get into the story and make it creative by the villian was basic other then that i give it 1010 the acting was great they got the point across with a extremes amount of humor as a good use the cgi in the movie was used perfectly and they made sure it didnt look stupid which was what i had feared for the movie but overall the was rather good
Aug 8 2016,positive,not better than the original but still good
Aug 8 2016,negative,completely disrespectful and pails in comparison to the greatness of the original stay at home rent the original and have a much better time
Aug 8 2016,positive,to the haters who want to say this movie destroyed the franchise  i would like to remind them that ghostbusters 2 already did that what feig and his crew of lady busters offer is hilarious lighthearted fun kate mckinnon stands out in particular as a femme version of egon with an overtly bizarre nature paired with a brilliant mind  awesome cameos abound genuine laughs abound unless youre a sexist sour puss
Aug 8 2016,negative,feminism at its finest
Aug 8 2016,positive,i loved the movie the power of patty compels you xd this is a movie everyone should see if they like the paranormal and want to have a good laugh and the special effects dont get me started they were awesome the movie was great
Aug 8 2016,neutral,its very unfair to compare this to the original but its hard not to when you have the same plot climax and ending for a movie thats supposed to be a reboot although the 4 leads melissa mccarthy kristen wiig kate mckinnon and leslie jones all share great performances and laughs unfortunately gets lost in a complete rehash story of the 1984 original
Aug 8 2016,neutral,would have been better as a direct to video release
Aug 8 2016,negative,grrrr will they stop doing mindless soulless remake like this   and no im not misogynist 
Aug 8 2016,neutral,badly written movie  talented cast barely scrapes this by as enjoyable  felt like a wasted opportunity
Aug 8 2016,negative,i love the actors in this movie but the flick itself was a bore
Aug 8 2016,negative,i was excited about the cast grew concerned because of the trailer and left the theater nearly disgusted people whining about them retooling the cast or messing with a masterpiece are missing the point this is awful contrived nonsensical lazy storytelling and is the first sign of paul feig letting his gender inversion of power principle go to his head you helped make melissa mccarthy a star fine fantastic but dont paralyze her career because you now insist on typecasting here    spoiler alert although this is the worlds most embarrassing spoiler and reading this may help you decide if you really want to give the snakes behind this movie your money    at one point theres a gigantic ghost careening towards the ghostbusters armed with their proton packs the ghost uses the lips of the building roofs to balance himself as he ambles onward one of the ghostbusters yells lets help him loosen his grip they then all shoot their proton beams at the ghosts groin causing him to cover his genitals and topple to the street    again if you are complaining about an allfemale cast or anything laden within the films intention you were ready to hate this movie i went into this movie with a naive glimmer of optimism after reading a now seemingly bizarrely unfounded wave of positive criticism i wanted to like this movie disregarding a couple pacing problems bereft in the early chapters of the film and then finding nothing to defend by the final series of action sequences shame on the people who took advantage of getting the green light to make this movie and wasting not only the proven talents of wiig and mccarthy but also the blown bigscreen opportunities for mckinnon and jones
Aug 8 2016,negative,plot twist other than the shouting leslie jones the racist racebaiter was the only one who showed up shes the only one who seemed like a legit character if i didnt know that kate mckinnon was actually funny i would think she genuinely shouldnt ever work again i dont understand what feig was doing i think maybe he was really high
Aug 8 2016,positive,nostalgic funny and with the elements from the original lovit
Aug 8 2016,negative,i chuckled and i use that term loosely twice during this comedy movie i wanted to like it i had low expectations and i ended up grimacing through the majority of the scenes and terrible jokes it just wasnt not funny to me it was cringeworthy    the story was weak as was the villain and the movie relied so heavily on its ghostbusters licence to pick up where the the rest of the movie failed but it couldnt even successfully do that as it used poorlyplaced references to the originals the movies a mess and im dumbfounded as to why it was so positivelyreceived by critics
Aug 8 2016,positive,not perfect but really funny great new characters its a mix between the first seasons of the real ghostbusters with j michael straczynski as story editor and the first ghostbusters film    i hope there will be more to come
Aug 8 2016,negative,terrible movie unless your a child but then again the dialog is way too complicated for a child to understand  good effects and thats it  why would you load up a movie with funny comedians and give them incredibly bad lines to say    the cameos were the absolute worst  i honesty wanted my money and time back after watching this garbage  i felt embarrassed for the actors  not even worth renting
Aug 8 2016,positive,good most of the comedy stuff wasnt funny though chris hemsworth was best part of the movie
Aug 8 2016,negative,i can count on 1 hand with 3 finger cut off how many times i laughed out loud  the movie was about as sexist as it try to claim people how dont see it are  the majority of its jokes where shots at men  overall the movies was terrible lucky for me my friend bought the tickets
Aug 8 2016,positive,not the original but good balanced fun film
Aug 8 2016,positive,there really are only three reasons i can see for why somebody wouldnt like this film 1 they hated the original two ghostbusters movies fair enough reason 2 they have their nostalgia goggles on so tight its choked off oxygen to their brain or 3 are blatantly misogynist  i went in prepared to see a big steaming pile and was surprised at just how good it was  equal to the first two in all ways and maybe even better in some others
Aug 7 2016,positive,it wasnt horrible  it fell into a few toptheoriginal clichã cs but cleverly subverted several other clichã cs in the process  the writing was witty and clever as well giving many mods to the original without feeling blatant  many were cute and didnt stop the flow of its story in order to go hey guys the original remember     honestly though aside from a few choice scenes the end of the second act into the finale wasnt edited well and lost much of the clever themes that had put into place in the first act  clearly paul fieg can do setups and is a good director first act is pretty well done but his eye for action isnt there  it wasnt gripping    all in all it was a decent movie  it wasnt terrible it wasnt a masterpiece and the only reason its getting so much hate is because of the genderswap which they 4th wall many times and even predict how the audiences reaction was going to be before anyone saw it  i just wish the movie was grest so it could really shove it in everyones face of how sexist people are
Aug 7 2016,positive,personally i liked the original ghostbusters film but i found myself enjoying it a little more there was good comedy great acting and good effects melissa mccarthy like in most of her movies had a great performance and it was fun to see her yell at the chinese guy and then bust some ghosts and it was interesting seeing chris hemsworth take on the role of kevin the dumb assistant it had a good plot and overall was a very enjoyable movie 7910
Aug 7 2016,positive,it was ok some jokes are hit or miss some characters are hit or miss pretty much this movie is hit or miss to a lot of people but to me i like it 610
Aug 7 2016,neutral,a new start for a new franchise  lets hope they rework some of it  an okay reboot of the original  using the same lingo and updated equipment you feel almost immediately you are in ghost busters territory but you keep waiting for the big laughs but they dont come  you snicker here and there  maybe a chortle or two but no belly laughs no slap you leg moments of comedy   nostalgic memories keep you watching hoping for something more which doesnt materialize  great to see slimer and stay pufted in action again but if a sequel is in the works ill pass
Aug 7 2016,positive,it wasnt bad i really liked the comedy but i think it would be way better if itd go into horror direction more scarier
Aug 7 2016,negative,a disgrace that set back the womens movement a few years so stereotypical and unfunny its almost painful to force an all female cast an unnecessary thing to do in general to portrait women this way is just insane
Aug 7 2016,neutral,the best way to describe this movie is ghostbusters ii but with a slightly worse plot and no bill murray harold ramis ernie hudson or dan ackroyd to carry the film and make it enjoyable a film that isnt actually terrible but its lack of anything special is its downfall it has parts that are actually kind of funny and parts that are awful and then there are the parts that are just pure nothingness its not consistently hilarious or consistently awful just because it isnt complete utter garbage doesnt mean you should see it though itd be like chugging pasta sauce sure it doesnt taste like total shit but wouldnt you rather eat a pizza or something instead
Aug 7 2016,negative,a very lame try to cash some money out of the franchise
Aug 7 2016,negative,this movies first joke is about queefs smh
Aug 7 2016,negative,it was lazy it was crap i can only hope they dont make enough money to justify another
Aug 7 2016,positive,ghostbusters was amazingly funny i dont understand what people where talking about is it that the cast was all super funny strong kick ass women it was great its about time we have female heros in movie    negative  critics  can suck it they know nothing its about time too see females as more than girlfriends side kicks or helpless damsels in distress its good to see normal looking women kicking ass and taking names
Aug 7 2016,positive,funny good characters entertaining
Aug 7 2016,negative,wack wait till dvd on redbox for 1
Aug 7 2016,positive,better than the original ghostbusters in every concievable way more entertaining better fleshed out characters a more engaging plot a villain with more than 3 lines and better humor too instead of weird out of place humor like egon getting his dick sucked by a ghost in a dream or peter venkman being a gross creep you get characters like kevin and holtzmann who really make the movie great the only thing ill give the original is it had its great ideas first looking forward to the sequel
Aug 7 2016,negative,apparently there is something nobody understands changing a cast from male to female and vice versa changes the whole target of the audience thing of tv show for instance only for women like golden girls t o be rebooted like  golden buddies with old male characters that would change the whole show in comedy and targeting only male audience its the same here this version of ghostbusters is only for a particular piece of audience women movie was tasteless for me and was another mediocre movie for myt taste from a mediore director with only one movie with success i really wonder how sony trust him to do such a hard project  my prediction is that there will be new ghostbusters with male characters as the original in 34 years and the script will have to be by its creator mr dan akroyd
Aug 7 2016,positive,chris hemsworth is the best actor in the whole movie
Aug 7 2016,positive,this movie was great it was respectful and made nods to the original while blazing its own trail the cameos were great and the girls were not their counterparts with boobs it was a great time to watch and i hope we get to find out what they had planned for a sequel
Aug 7 2016,negative,an incredibly awful movie avoid this if you can
Aug 7 2016,neutral,it was a fun summer movie a lot of bad jokes and forced acting the cast didnt mesh well together but i still took it with a grain of salt and enjoyed the film
Aug 7 2016,positive,id wanted to see this movie since i found out melissa mccarthy kate mckinnon and leslie jones were among the featured cast members and they didnt disappoint  i also loved the visual effects and the brief appearance by bill murray if you go be sure to stay through the end credits plenty of outtakes and graphics to enjoy till the screen goes dark
Aug 7 2016,positive,dont even listen to what the sexist detractors are pouting so much about this excellent hilarious reboot is even better than the original movie with great actresses playing intelligent women who can kick more ass than a lot of men  and the special effects are sensational
Aug 7 2016,positive,how the hell does ghostbusters have more than suicide squad explain
Aug 7 2016,positive,a modern take on a classic with humour and a sense that the stakes are very real in the moment
Aug 7 2016,positive,this movie was great i had lots of laughs loved the old characters stepping in as well hope they make a number 2 only bad thing is i wish it was longer
Aug 7 2016,positive,it was s great comedy that had us laughing throughout i like it much more than i thought i would it was great action and story
Aug 7 2016,negative,i had low expectations for this movie and wouldnt have bothered except that other people said it was really good  i think they wanted it to be good for feminist reasons  sadly the script and editing just did not live up to the talent of the participating actresses  there were a few laughs but other times the dialogue just felt clunky or in the case of holtzman way too gimmicky  lastly if what people want is a feminist scifi adventure movie why not just make a new really good one  why bother with a remake in the first place  there just was not really a need  i dont have a crazy weird original fan feeling about that  i wouldnt have seen the point of remaking it with men either  hollywood owes these and all women more because they are better than this
Aug 7 2016,negative,terrible movie i doubt the writes have even seen the original movies or understand what made it a huge hit
Aug 7 2016,negative,i dont have any problems with the cast its just that i really didnt think this movie was really that funny i didnt like the cameos and none of the jokes worked for me there are some good moments but in the end i didnt enjoy this as much as i thought i would
Aug 7 2016,positive,loved it  great nods to the past franchise while building its own identity funny smart great casting really loved it
Aug 7 2016,negative,i just wasted my time and money with this move it had one good joke and that is about the fun i had while i was watching this move i do not recommend watching this move
Aug 7 2016,negative,adam sandler humor uninspired plot bland characters tries to sell based on the name alone worse effects than scooby doo 2 and pushes an feminist agenda    worst movie of the year
Aug 7 2016,negative,what a shame ghostbusters3 never got made this pile of unimaginative uninteresting  and unfunny drivel is an insult to the originals only gets 1 star for mckinnon actually being mildly amusing a couple of times
Aug 7 2016,negative,this is a 210 movie at best
Aug 7 2016,negative,im a liberal and supporter of feminism so dont get me confused with those idiots who were hating on this movie before they saw it but this movie was garbage hemsworth and jones made me laugh but their jokes got annoying after awhile the rest of the cast was unfunny for the most part expect for a few funny jokes like the jaws joke also i didnt like the orginal ghostbusters that much so this movie didnt have to impress me that much but this movie turned out to be really bad
Aug 7 2016,positive,nostalgic from first movie but wasnt too wild on the plot
Aug 7 2016,positive,honestly one of the best movies ive seen in ages in theatres  i couldnt stop laughing  i loved hemsworth as the dimwitted kevin and thought it looked like he was having a lot of fun    ill definitely be watching this movie again and again and again  mckinnons genius holtzmann is one reason to watch but wiigs dr erin gilbert was a remarkably nuanced representation of the actual reality of being a woman in a stem field  i would have loved to have seen a longer movie that would have given them more time to play with leslie jones character  thats honestly my only complaintthey didnt have enough time to make us fall in love with every character  they could make us like everyone but only characters who managed to wow at first appearance could get pure love    this movie is great
Aug 7 2016,positive,great cast funny script and chris hemsworth is great to watch
Aug 7 2016,positive,just as fun as the originals better fx than the originals and the casting choice an writing is inclusive in a way no other movie before it
Aug 7 2016,negative,just another upsetting remake of a classic and loved series
Aug 7 2016,positive,we go to the movies to be entertained i left the movie just that it probably wont be a cult classic like the original but it was entertaining
Aug 7 2016,negative,mckinnon and jones were irritating the movie wasnt horrible but not very good either
Aug 7 2016,positive,i loved this couldnt have asked for more to be honest
Aug 7 2016,positive,pleasantly surprised by this fun frothy summer movie  it has a light and wacky feel much fanservice to the original ghostbusters and a goofy enthusiasm in the performances of its five stars  melissa mccarthy kristin wiig leslie jones chris hemsworth and especially kate mckinnon  too much technobabble an unfunny hitch i am going to blame on the influence of dan ackroyd on the script  reverent yet stiff cameos by the surviving ogb main cast members minus key player rick moranis  plot varies in some ways from ogb yet manages to break no new ground to speak of and unlike the original doesnt even try to make it look like the ghostbusters are earning a living at the trade  if you stick it out to the very end of the long long end credits there is one short postcredit scene which i think you could just skip and catch on youtube without missing much   all that said this is a highly worthy homage to a great old movie
Aug 7 2016,positive,i was a little skeptical about the remake but this is actually better than the original film the cast is superb and the film was a lot of fun
Aug 7 2016,positive,saw it 3 times already yes it got dumb moments like the soup joke was freaking lame and drag a liitle too long   i liked the movie and its great that future ghostbusters merchandise would aim both little boys and little girls    so lame jokes aside the movie was good and ill be glad to put the bluray aside of the originals boxset    oh and thanks for the movie the ecto cooler and twinkies are back again i think  i didnt spotted any in quebec cant deny that
Aug 7 2016,positive,its okay chris hemsworth seemed to really be enjoying himself and was probably the best part of the movie i didnt care for the poop jokes and other cheap gags this seems like a movie that really could have been good with a few tweaks which is probably the most disappointing aspect of the movie
Aug 7 2016,positive,it had its funny moments but it wasnt great
Aug 7 2016,positive,i really enjoyed this movie it was funny and very entertaining i loved the cast
Aug 7 2016,positive,fun movie just let it be what it is and dont judge it by the older movies
Aug 7 2016,positive,not the disaster some thought actually funny and the leads do have a charm that works doesnt have that kinetic energy of the original but works in its own right
Aug 7 2016,positive,stop comparing this to the originals because its not anywhere close to it nor should it be this was an amazing reboot for this movie to me reboots always fail and never feel the same or stand on their own but i feel this movie released before the originals would be an instant classic stop leaving in the past and enjoy the movies today
Aug 7 2016,positive,awesome to keep the franchise alive and well   not a replacement for the oringial that goes to say with all reboots but that being said a great refresh on this day and age of ghost bustin
Aug 7 2016,positive,hilarious thats the point right this movie made the entire theater laugh and we all left smiling absolutely wonderfully done
Aug 7 2016,negative,half of a star for the old glories who made a cameo the only positive thing of the movie  the film itself is boring to long  dont lose any time to watch it  why is  hollywood trying to milk a ead cow why dont you come up with an original idea
Aug 7 2016,negative,utter rubbish i want my watching time back
Aug 7 2016,negative,worst film i have ever seen since batman and robin just awful
Aug 7 2016,positive,short and sweet  it was not good  the character interaction seemed very forced i love how on rotten tomatoes when the critics score is much higher then the viewer score it is a red flag that the critic reviews are bought and paid for
Aug 7 2016,negative,this movie did not need to be remade it doesnt matter the gender of the cast it was already a really good movie if you want to make an all woman movie great but find an original idea dont just rehash an old one
Aug 7 2016,positive,great movie and the cast was amazing
Aug 7 2016,negative,not sure where the praise is coming from despite the fact they tried to do something new here with a new direction which i totally respect you cannot avoid the fact its a total flop its a boring movie which feels really childish it tries to be funny but isnt amusing in the slightest really a really disappointing use of such a good licence
Aug 7 2016,negative,even for a chickflick this is a lame flameout i only went to see it because of all the drama sony  and the cast were stirring up the script was embarrassingly unfunny the effects were cheap and cartoonish etc the cast is a competent enough bunch but youd never know it watching this train wreck the director made a dismal botch of the whole mess  skip this turkey and rent the original the reboot is a waste of time money and talent
Aug 7 2016,positive,i actually enjoyed this for what its meant to be  a harmless and fun family film many have overly criticised this wanting it to be some sort of nostalgic work of genius i just tried to see this as a separate film  from the old ones
Aug 7 2016,positive,of course its not the alltime classic original but it is one of the best of the summer and the outstanding cast prove that a female buddy movie can be uproariously funny without constantly resorting to cheap humor excellent
Aug 7 2016,neutral,cute kate mckinnon was the strongest of the characters  without her the movie would have made me lose interest
Aug 7 2016,positive,stellar 3d and fun performances from an enjoyable cast the humour however was very low brow and heavy handed
Aug 7 2016,positive,the movie was funny and great
Aug 7 2016,negative,the first 30 minutes are okay and the last 15 are good but in between its a snoozefest
Aug 7 2016,positive,good fun with loads of nods to the original line up this is a new beast though where the graphics are floor less the cast funny but the scares few with a weak story hopefully this one will be the first of a few which will iron out the issues
Aug 7 2016,positive,this movie was great goofy and funny had a lot of fun watching this with friends
Aug 7 2016,positive,great fun a humorous movie doesnt take itself seriously  the women cast is greatly successful  kate mckinnons character is hilarious
Aug 6 2016,positive,despite all of the bad reviews surrounding the movie it was actually very enjoyable and fun its a great movie to watch with your family my little brother loved it
Aug 6 2016,positive,way better than i was expecting hilarious reimagining of the ghostbusters franchise wiig and mccarthy are hilarious when playing off each other hemsworth was a riot playing a dumb pretty boy watch for cameos from all of the remaining original ghostbusters cast a laughaminute film
Aug 6 2016,negative,if there was a negative star rating this one deserves it
Aug 6 2016,positive,we went to see ghostbusters in 3d today and we all loved it  laughed loud and often  loved the cameos  i will buy the dvd when it is released
Aug 6 2016,positive,even more laughs than the original
Aug 6 2016,positive,fun for my familyon our family summer trip we made time for this movie great grandmother all the way down to our 8 year old went to the movie and enjoyed it  credit is given to the original cast the story is solid actors are fun and the humor is spot on  worth my time and money
Aug 6 2016,negative,poor film really dissapointed had so much expectation it sucked
Aug 6 2016,positive,lots of fun i would highly recommend it especially if you liked the original
Aug 6 2016,neutral,i give this movie 3 stars cause it was okay funny is very predictable but jokes were funny so i say this is one of those movie you can watch when it is released on dvd it was a little scary lol but i should have waited till it came out on dvd
Aug 6 2016,positive,as an antifeminist who hates to see my precious 1980s childhood classics rehashed i have to admitthe new chick ghostbuster movie was pretty cool probably because it was produced by an actual ghostbuster dan aykroydthose of you from my generation would especially appreciate the old celeb cameos and references ps chris hemsworth is my new fav dumb blonde
Aug 6 2016,positive,by and large a fantastic hilarious movie i hope theres a sequel to this sequel
Aug 6 2016,negative,you could literally package this anything other than a ghost busters reboot and it would still get a poot rating the comedy was obvious the characters were forgettable and the plot was too rushed and silly there was nothing earned by these characters in the world of ghost busters the movie basically walks them through the entire movie by the hand
Aug 6 2016,negative,i felt this movie was going to be a waste of time after the first few minutes i stayed it got worse i stayed i considered walking out just to let you know ive only walked out of two movies this one almost made the list it was a disappointment because the original was a great movie dont the people who produced this movie as well as the other many bad movies that have been coming out every actually watch them someones got way too much money and way to little talent
Aug 6 2016,negative,by far the worst ghost buster movie of all time
Aug 6 2016,positive,better than expected  well casted  with a hilarious group of amazing women  i felt it did a great job at honoring the original as well  hats off to you ladies  job well done
Aug 6 2016,positive,best of the bunch by a long shot the only weak point here is the villain as played by neil casey reading his biography im willing to let that slide though its an odd casting choice thankfully chris hemsworth is on task to do cleanup on that side of things and he nails it nicely    really impressed that all these funny ladies let hemsworth get so many stellar laugh lines as well     and not for nothin this thing does something very few others manage treats its female leads seriously and without typecasting
Aug 6 2016,negative,worst movie ever  the guy selling tickets said wed be sorry and we said it couldnt be that bad  but it was even worse
Aug 6 2016,positive,fun  christopher hemsworths role worth the price of admission
Aug 6 2016,positive,i waiting for it to come out on dvd
Aug 6 2016,negative,wish i could say 0 stars
Aug 6 2016,positive,love it all the way
Aug 6 2016,negative,the only crime this film is truly guilty of is not being funny
Aug 6 2016,positive,better than the original and i was there for the original  funny really really funny
Aug 6 2016,positive,fun and fresh loved the cast both leslie jones and kate mkinnon do great jobs the cast has lots of chemistry and i loved the kinda cheesy ghost vibe lots of great homages to the originals highly recommend also chris hemsworth nails his role
Aug 6 2016,positive,i know this film has had a lot of controversy for a number of different reasons but as this isnt a sequel but a reboot then it should be judged based on the movie itself and not the 1984 movie i personally enjoyed the performance by the four strong female leads and their believable onscreen friendship i found the film funny and not like some comedy films were you feel like you have to through a laugh in once or twice so you dont look stone hearted the cgi was impressive and the cameos from some of the original cast was an extra added surprise i would recommend watching the movie before deciding yourself if you liked it or not before you stick with another persons opinion
Aug 6 2016,negative,poor reboot of the original   the acting was terrible and the ghosts were lame
Aug 6 2016,negative,gave it a shotand wanted to shoot myself in the head after watching it
Aug 6 2016,positive,enjoyable movie but not up to either 1980s version   the  zip and humor that you would expect is missing    the special effects near the end are pretty good no original moments  i hoped for more   however how many remakes or reboots are good
Aug 6 2016,positive,its not bad by any means but its also far from great the film is well cast but the story falls short relying far too heavily on the original films worth a rental if bustin still makes you feel good
Aug 6 2016,positive,while this iteration cant quite measure up to the original two movies you shouldnt knock it until you try it people who dont like melissa mccarthys comedic stylings will be pleasantly surprised by how unabrasive she is in this the whole cast does a great job with what theyve got the standout is chris hemsworth who is delightfully inept as the new ghostbusters receptionist
Aug 6 2016,negative,meh     pretty terrible comedy the first two acts are missed opportunities the final act is fun if a little ott     its just a shame that ghostbusters has turned into this kind of movie
Aug 6 2016,neutral,started out great but that third act was just not good at all i really enjoyed the new weapons used against the ghosts and the cast were all great especially mckinnon and jones but the super scifi bit at the end just took me out of the movie i hope if they do a sequel that they keep it creepy like the opening sequence was because that was what made the movie stand out from the original in my opinion
Aug 6 2016,positive,i really hope they make a sequel  i liked this a lot
Aug 6 2016,negative,oof    i really wanted to give this film a chance i really wanted it to succeed but ultimately its terrible effects and even more abhorrent writing successfully dug its grave the good takeaway is that chris hemsworth should look into doing more comedy
Aug 6 2016,positive,funny easy going movie get over the past and stop comparing it to original ghostbusters these movie is so fun and the cast is just great
Aug 6 2016,negative,not as good as the original they tried too hard to be funny and it came across as boring
Aug 6 2016,negative,the cast was great until the forced jokes got the better of them i was not sure what the movie was trying to be a comedy actioncomedy or a parody of itself this really could have been an opportunity but something really didnt click the story could have connected with the previous volumesuniverse and it would have made more sense instead it was trying to reproduce the original magic this would have been a better rental than theater visit i was surprised to see the critics give it such high reviews but then i realized their critics
Aug 6 2016,positive,classic paul feig humour throughout the pacing is closer to an 80s film than a 21st century action flick and the cgi is mostly quite good like ghostbusters 2 this is a wonderful comedyhorroraction film that suffers from comparison rather than actually fatal flaws
Aug 6 2016,positive,ghostbusters 2016 is rather hit or miss in the laughs department and the finale is rather a bythenumbers special effects extravaganza but compared to the highly negative prerelease hype the film is a bouncy and smileinducing actioncomedy most of the problems in the comedic elements are due to the script rather than the performances the four lead actresses try hard except maybe wiig and sell the material well the film is nothing more than an enjoyable and silly two hours with amusing company and even a touch of horror rating 64
Aug 6 2016,positive,the film does a great job of showing how women can carry the show in other genres other than romcoms the laughter is consistent throughout the movie the cast did a great job but theres no doubt that kate mckinnon stole the show
Aug 6 2016,positive,ghostbusters 2016 was fun to watch  it was great to see some ghosts get blasted again since the last time i saw that happen was when i was 7  this movie contained some excellent easter eggs and nods to both the older movies and the real ghostbusters cartoon the ghosts looked spectacular and were creepy yet fun chris hemsworth was foolishly hilarious the new team had great chemistry and had some great standout moments rowan this films main bad guy needed some more buildup and character in gb2 we barely saw vigo but you could feel his menacing pressence throughout  bottom line this was a funnycreepy movie and im looking forward to a sequel
Aug 6 2016,positive,it was an ok movie reasonable ghost plot good effects but it really wasnt that funny  and they made chirs hemsworth character a moron for no laughs and then a smart  main character kristen wiig all goofy around chris hemsworth that said kids loved it  ages 6 and 10 if tells you anything they really liked patty and holtzmann  does anyone else notice wiiganiston resemblance
Aug 6 2016,negative,went to see it terrible movie no real plot two dimensional characters great cgi effects  but terrible writing
Aug 6 2016,positive,funny hope the next instalment will be better
Aug 6 2016,negative,this movie was a complete snoozefest cannot argue with those who believed that this shouldnt have been made because it flatout sucked
Aug 6 2016,negative,there is zero magic in this movie the 4 leads look and feel like they dont want to be there it was like they were just reading the script and not trying to act  we left at about 45 minutes no one in the group wanted to stay  it wasnt even worth the 5 bucks i paid on discount tuesday   ill just say stay away this movie smell like a cooler filled with fish that has been left in the sun for two weeks its slap ya in the face bad
Aug 6 2016,neutral,when i went into ghostbusters i had a very clear idea of what i would see a flawed but cute popcorn movie with a good amount of laughs mainly from my beloved melissa mccarthy sadly my laughs and giggles combined amounted to less than 10 that left me disappointed and surprised    ive watched melissa in spy good film good laughs happened upon the heat on tv had missed roughly half of it nice film good laughs i looked up and watched bridesmaids awesome film good laughs they and ghostbusters also share paul feigs direction    i was amazed to find melissa lacking in vivacity and character in this one im still asking myself whether i was in a bad mood while watching the film same for kristen and whatever poorly developed relationship they had kate was rather enjoyable she was kooky and unpredictable in a refreshing way leslie was bringing up historical facts and i was wondering is that kooky or nerdy of her is she smart    im sure better story dialogue and character development wouldve seen these ladies perform miracles i wanted that cast to be written in a way id call all of these women crazy misfits but sophisticated in unusual and admirable ways and bringing their individual sense of humor kinda true for kate not really for the rest    one of the jokes i laughed with was a creative sequence of birdflipping by some brieflyshown guy as it started i was like a ha right saw that stuff before but then he made cute bird sounds and i laughed whats sad here is this could be part of any movie as do many other this guy is stupid this guy did that thing jokes the whole ghostbusting theme the undead the technology not much humor came from that it was like a cheesy sitcom with a ghostfighting subplot    id like to mention ive watched the original ghostbusters way too long ago to care about comparing the two i also dont care much about the controversy though im towards the side of the film and girls    and i really dont mind the men are dumb jokes bit heavy on the feminist side dont care when i go to laugh at a melissa mccarthy movie i just want to laugh at witty dialogue and a sensible amount of slapstick and other humor of that level dumb pretty boy toilet humor fine ill take it but it just wasnt funny not that i need to laugh to enjoy good comedic writing and narrative but that was absent too and there was a funny bit of toilet humor on bridesmaids when that sort of humor is wellserved i make a grimace but embrace it being a human being when its badly made like the you soiled your pants no i didnt yes you did here its just annoying    i expected much more from melissa and paul feig minimum a stupid film thatd make me laugh heck i still question whether my boredom was due to a bad mode but i think this is just a bland film
Aug 6 2016,negative,ghostbusters feels like a pointless remake and a cashgrab
Aug 6 2016,neutral,ok movie for people who have not seen the original ghostbusters after seeing the original this was a very big disappointment
Aug 6 2016,positive,almost as good as the original  and im a bit biased  ghosts were very well done and believable
Aug 6 2016,negative,started out promising then seemed to careen into an area of overacting and hokey jokes and effects
Aug 6 2016,negative,its a terrible movie nothing else for me to say
Aug 6 2016,negative,not funny despite having great comedic actors in it boring tiresome and dull
Aug 6 2016,positive,really enjoyed this film
Aug 6 2016,positive,was okay but i felt like this movie did what force awaken didretell the exact same story as the original movie just with a female lead dont get me wrong i enjoyed this movie but the special effects were dated and after all of the scifi movies since the last ghost busters the special effects shows nothing new or ground breaking the actressesperfect no complaints at all its like a first date with a woman you think is gonna be your type and you find out she is just like your ex i give it a go see if you want to lol but not a movie for oohs and ahhhs
Aug 6 2016,negative,not that funny i fell asleep in the middle and i love slapstick comedies this one did not make the cut failed jokes misfiring lines and poor delivery forget watching this movie even for brainless fun
Aug 6 2016,negative,horrible movie 2hours lost
Aug 6 2016,negative,its a mediocre film poor writing bad direction and not enough difference between characters to make this director the right choice for seeing it     it would be easier not to compare this with the original if they didnt keep shoving it down the audiences throat ever two seconds     saw it with my niece she loved it and it was fun to watch with her     the gadgets and set pieces had some more interest than the old one     the graphics were soso     grace jones was funny     i feel that ghostbusters fans the actors in this movie and women who want representation in movies deserved a better movie than this in addition to getting a ghostbusters movie     watch it when its on netflix or at the cheap theater dont bother paying full price
Aug 6 2016,positive,amusing the classic cannot be beaten but they did good with this remake
Aug 6 2016,negative,horrid movie with slapstick comedy and shallow plot
Aug 6 2016,negative,right all men draw tits to promote their companys logo and an emo suicide makes you a god
Aug 6 2016,negative,an unspirited rimshot moneygrab on an irreplaceable ip by the hackneyed feig and his cast of social statements this isnt the dynamic and genius combination of aykroyd murray hudson and ramis instead we get a loud racist depiction of a mammy a loud rotund lump of crassness a neurotic unfunny insistence that shes funny no seriously american public and kristen wiig combined these women dont carry an ounce of the acting and screen presence weaver did and the dryly sardonic wonderful humor that potts brought to janine is lost in the thickly duncelike performance that hemsworth has consistently brought to ruin every other film hes been in want to have a better evening than seeing this get a root canal feig should be rocketted into the sun for this abomination
Aug 6 2016,negative,shame on them for using a classic to peddle modern social issues  aside from that its still a 1 onetime redbox rental with a single shining star  mm that barely makes it worth the washington
Aug 6 2016,positive,ok as a stand alone like halloween 3 season of the witch not part of the series
Aug 6 2016,positive,this movie isalright comparing it to the original its not perfect there were some good things and there were some bad things but in my own opinion its alright    lets talk the bad things first to get the taste out of my mouth the comedy is funny but not laugh out loud funny and its mostly one of those awkward conversation jokes with the people talking over each other i mostly hate kevin played by chris hemsworth his character is so dumb that every time he starts to talk in a stupid way my mind goes stop i like the cameos from the original cast some cameos were clever others not so much the king of these bad cameos is bill murray i cannot think of one good thing about his extended cameo which should of been just one scene but then they killed him off for some reason    okay now lets talk about the good things in this movie i do like the actresses they played their characters well mostly kate mckinnon she is crazy good i mean literally crazy she is enjoyable i also enjoy the action and special effects  in comparison to the original movie its better but most importantly i like how it shows development even if it doesnt show that much giving erin gilberts backstory was kinda pointless but in a way showing how determined she is saying that she saw a ghost and no one believes her accept abby is good because it really shows how great their friendship as it was shown in the climax     so like i said this movie is alight it has good action but not that good comedy i would want to see this again if i had the chance i would also want to see a sequel mostly because i dont want to leave this hanging with one movie i feel like it would do a whole lot better because i really like the actresses not to mention kids would be disappointed if there wasnt another one i really want to see where this is going whether its old or new i still love ghostbusters from the bottom of my heart
Aug 6 2016,neutral,who ya gonna call  not these clownshoes  director paul feig reboots ghostbusters as a screwball feminist comedy  former paranormal researchers erin gilbert and abby yates reunite when a museum curator comes looking for help with a haunting and when they end up getting fired from their respective colleges for their ghost investigating activities they go into business for themselves  the cast stars melissa mccarthy and snl alum kristen wiig kate mckinnon and leslie jones and therein lies the problem  the characters are all onedimensional caricatures particularly mckinnon who delivers some of the best laughs but is always mugging for the camera and pushing the jokes past the point where they stop being funny  and chris hemsworth is poison playing a character thats too stupid to live and annoyingly so  the funnies bits of the film actually come from the cameos of the original 84 ghostbusters cast which are all incredibly fun  it has its moments and delivers some laughs but ghostbusters is more concerned with jokes than character and story
Aug 6 2016,negative,the problem is not the female cast its just lamely outdated and not funny
Aug 6 2016,negative,walkout and ask for a refund
Aug 6 2016,positive,loved it its modernized campy at times and has proper cameos from the original cast confused as to the poor ratings and why anyone would expect to see the exact replica of the original films is beyond me its not necessarily for kids  some of the humor is definitely adult but it was enjoyable as long as you go in with an open mind and ready to laugh
Aug 6 2016,negative,forgettable film wait for a true reboot
Aug 6 2016,positive,imperfect fun some clunky bits but on the whole great fun to watch
Aug 6 2016,positive,not as good as the original but it still holds up as its own movie some good moments in the film cgi was decent good soundtrack
Aug 6 2016,positive,really enjoyed it it works well and doesnt rely on the original movie
Aug 6 2016,positive,why are white men so lame i grew up with ghostbusters too and its not ruining my childhood if this ruins your childhood it must have been a pretty sad one just admit this movie is funny
Aug 6 2016,positive,i was engulfed  i laughed  i jumped  i applauded wonderful uptodate  version that still held its roots and paid homage to the originals  this movie made me proud
Aug 6 2016,positive,when the four leading ladys bounce off each other with puns awkward conversation and straight up silliness thats when the movie shines
Aug 6 2016,negative,awful effects bad chemistry between main cast and 4th grade level antimale comedy if this movie wanted to empower women it shouldve given the female cast character not make everyone a flat stereotype and antagonize both the male gender and the ghostbusters logo itself also lots of sleazy product placements and fakealtered reviews as expected from sony the only thing positive in the film is shockingly the humanity found in leslie jones character patty tolan
Aug 6 2016,negative,i have followed a lot of reviews on rt i think that if the movie would have been absolutely identical apart from the gender of the cast it would most certainly not be cerified fresh
Aug 6 2016,positive,being one of those people who did like the original ghostbusters i was surprised when i left the movie theater with a smile i enjoyed the movie though the characters are not very deep and at times the group indeed does not seem to work together the overall story was interesting and chris hemsworths character got genuine laughs out of me even though this is nothing like the original it was pleasant i will say kate mckinnons character seemed just out of place and forced into the movie but it did not mar the whole experience all in all nice is the word to use for this ghostbusters reboot
Aug 6 2016,neutral,honestly i was a little disappointed the actors in this movie are all amazingly talented and funny but they didnt mix very well with the scripted lines there were some good moments but not enough to be mentioned after you leave the cinema nothing to boast about
Aug 6 2016,negative,this movie is absolutely not worth watching typical cookie cutter characters not funny not suspenseful  only positive of this movie is the chemistry of the girls  do yourself a favor and see something that wont rot your brain
Aug 6 2016,positive,a fun and entertaining movie yet this ghostbusters remake possesses all the traits of a really bad comedy incorporated within its very amusing fantasyaction scenarios its difficult to call this a bad remake because ghostbusters was one of my favorite films as a child it definitely takes on a very similar style to the original movie using a coexisting storyline from a girlpower point of view but if it were anything else my opinion of the film wouldnt be very high i basically want to see someone reboot ghostbusters like they did batman but we all know that wont happening any time soon all in all this was a little bit too family friendly when compared to my usually taste in films yet despite its overwhelming silliness the movie is still a lot of fun and i still recommend it
Aug 5 2016,neutral,was good not great somewhat forgettable compared to the first one story was weak but funny
Aug 5 2016,positive,this movie is much better than the reviews would have you believe it was a refreshing retake on the original with just enough of a nod to the original  these are funny women who dont over act  the dumb male hunk bit was not that big a part and in no way overshadowed the clever comedy  of its lead actors cameos by murray akroyd and sigourney weaver added to the fun go see it
Aug 5 2016,negative,poorly done remake  lacks the sweet relationships humor and originality of the masterful ghostbusterseveryone was very good in  the 1980s version murray ramis aykrod weaver potts moranis hudsonand the rest of the cast all fit together nicely this new film is filled with ugly ghoststhats all
Aug 5 2016,positive,what i can say is that for a reboot it was very different in story than the original  however unlike the original theres no real reason given to why the women become ghostbusters until the end saving the city  in the original it was a business venture where a segment of the movie shows the ghostbuster daily catching ghost  in this movie again not until the end they only catch one ghost and its released  so the ladies do not really do that much ghostbusting  also i dont think the character of kevin was necessary  while i dont mind having the ghostbusters be female i would have enjoyed it more if they tied it in with the original ghostbusters either by having one of the ladies a daughter or niece perhaps having dr jillian holtzmann related to raymond ray stantz and finding a proton pack and learning about the ghostbusters along that line  then creating a situation where there is need for the ghostbuster to come back  there were so many ways they could of connected the original to this new film besides cameos and for that i was very disappointed  yet the film was okay as an attempted as a reimagined ghostbusters film
Aug 5 2016,positive,it was a good idea but it was  a very bad story the movie was trying to hard surprisingly enough chris hemsworth was the funniest part  about this movie
Aug 5 2016,positive,wow i was laughing the whole time honestly i felt bad because i was laughing so loud and other people were there in the theater
Aug 5 2016,positive,after all the hype and controversy the ghostbusters reboot ultimatly turns out okay not terrible or great just adequate  the good eccentric engineer jillian holtzmann kate mckinnon streetsmart patty tolan leslie jones and especially the idiotic but handsome secretary kevin chris hemsworth are all mvps the cameos are funny and the 3rd act has alot of ghostbusting fun especially a standout scene with jillians dual ghostbusting pistols the cast has good chemistry and there are some laughs i also give it bonus points for the fact that the ghostbusters are their own characters and not just the original team copypaste minus a y chromosome and the sequelbegging is saved for the postcredits scene instead of just before credits  the bad the pacing feels very fast the jokes are hitormiss and every character is seemingly an open jerk to the ghostbusters while rarely getting any comeuppance in a competent comedy the jerkish character should get comeuppance in the form of misfortune like a crowbar to the jaw or falling down the stairs this makes me want the villain to succeed in his plan to kill everybody with a ghost army and this is not what i should be feeling in this type of movie
Aug 5 2016,positive,some strong performances dont make up for a flimsy script and unimaginative set pieces still not a bad time
Aug 5 2016,negative,terrible spend your hard earned money anywhere else
Aug 5 2016,negative,chris hemsworth and the chick that invented stuff were great the movie not so much
Aug 5 2016,negative,an utter train wreck and it could have been amazing id love to see more of the cast but the writers and director need to find new careers
Aug 5 2016,neutral,never seen it im willing to give it a chance although ive hated the entire ghostbuster franchise altogether i think bill murray is so unfunny that i have to watch the pianist to remind me that even the worst tragedy in the history of the world has more comedy in it than his whole acting career combined
Aug 5 2016,negative,i had written a pretty decent 2 paragraph review but the site crashed on me and i lack the motivation to rewrite the whole review for a painfully mediocre movie    dont watch it but if you do dont pay to watch it
Aug 5 2016,positive,the movie is well paced and the comedic styles of its leading ladies is well highlighted this is an enjoyable movie to watch with delightful cameos and tipping of the hat to its predecessor however it should be seen as a separate entity and the tone of the movie does not align with the classic
Aug 5 2016,negative,this has nothing to do with girl power its one muff and fart joke after another it looks like it was written with judd apatow and the rest of the this is the end  cast i had hopes but just like santa claus this reboot did not pay homage to the classic
Aug 5 2016,negative,i really thought or hoped that the trailers were just poorly cut and that the movie would prove to be at least ok  i was completely wrong  i only laughed 4 times during the nearly 2 hr long movie  those 4 times were all in the first half of the movie  the jokes or poor attempts at jokes left me shaking my head as to how someone would think that this was funny  the ghosts reminded me of the live action version of casper the friendly ghost or the often cited haunted  mansion  either way it looked terrible  part of what made the original great for me was that there were actual scares and spookiness in the original  in this new version there is nothing scary at all just cartoonish  this is especially true of the dragonlike ghost at the concert  most of the performances were not very good and in a few cases were way over the top and not in a good way  in the original the jokes came naturally out of what was happening at the moment  in the new version the jokes are forced into places that make no sense  the secretary was so monumentally stupid that  i just couldnt force myself to like this character at all  i would suggest that if you have any fondness of the original ghostbusters avoid this movie like the plague if you have never seen the ghostbusters before avoid this movie like the plague  in fact everyone just stay away from this
Aug 5 2016,negative,parts were it was supposed to be funny werent and in the first trailer it said it was a continuation but wasnt and the casting was great but story was horrible and was hard to put together over all movie  
Aug 5 2016,negative,i wanted to give this movie a chance try and let it stand on its own but i cannot see how anyone with a brain could sit and watch this movie without having a lobotomy they tried to update the old movie with newer gimmicks but even the fancier cgi graphics couldnt save this movie dont waste your time
Aug 5 2016,neutral,it was a valiant effort to continue a legacy that is ghostbusters what i feel is the jokes are a just a little too bland and in your face to be worthwhile the story characters and visual affects are quite wonderful but nothing felt witty it seemed as though it was dumbed down and humor was set right in front of you with poor staging kind of like an insult to intelligence the humor just didnt come naturally from just too scripted
Aug 5 2016,positive,as an 11 year old i find it very interesting and  awesome  i like how the the how realistic and funny it isthis is for all of you who want to see   girls rock the ghostbuster franchise
Aug 5 2016,positive,ghostbusters 3d review     i saw ghostbusters in real3d today i loved it it was appropriately silly and the genderswaps from the original were done beautifully the 4 female ghostbusters in the new version were not woman versions of the male stars in the original they had their own personalities and quirks    the female leads leslie jones melissa mccarthy kristen wiig and kate mckinnon were each wonderful leslie jones and kate mckinnon more than held their own along with the more well known pair of melissa mccarthy and kristin wiig i was especially impressed with kristin wiigs understated departure from her usual always brilliantly done zaniness in essence she was the straight woman to the comedy of the others it showed what a fine actress she is chris hemsworth was delightful as the lovable clueless pretty boy secretary to the 4 ladies    the 3d was the best ive seen in a while unlike many of todays 3d movies which are largely mostly in 2d with just selected scenes in 3d ghostbusters 3d seemed to be shot in total in actual 3d the special effects were adequate although not particularly notable     i really liked that the entire closing credit roll continued to be in actual 3d with fun cgi effects for the duration they never shifted to a black background for the latter credits as most films do the entire 3d version has a border around the image for the full film  this allows some clever spillover 3d images there is an extra scene at the very end of the credits so i suggest staying until the projector light goes out and the house lights go on
Aug 5 2016,positive,i wish movies like this were around when i was a kid funny smart women kicking butt
Aug 5 2016,negative,this movie is feminist shit and bad and gross jokes
Aug 5 2016,positive,they didnt screw it up all women flipping roles worked  more of a horror movie than anything  dont take your children
Aug 5 2016,negative,this movie was awful the humor was juvenile and repetitive  when i wasnt bored i felt like my intelligence was being insulted  this was a shameless exploitative cashgrab and sony should be deeply ashamed this trash ever left the cutting room floor
Aug 5 2016,positive,funny liked the cast and had a few good laughs went in with low expectations and came out pleased and i liked it
Aug 5 2016,negative,i would describe this movie as having more similarities with the live action scooby doo movies than it does with the last ghostbusters
Aug 5 2016,positive,given the poor reviews by fans  i wonder what they were expecting  thought it  was entertaining  had some great laughs  decent homage to the original  enjoyed it
Aug 5 2016,positive,ridiculously talented cast memorable cameos and great visuals makes up for a plot thats occasionally predictable id really recommend it
Aug 5 2016,positive,this film is funny and its great to see the ghostbusters being brought to a new audience it did not deserve the bad comments that were made about it it was the right thing to do to have an all female team to relaunch the series the originals were excellent and so is this one i am looking forward to the sequel as suggested by the after credit scene
Aug 5 2016,neutral,ads before the movie are all female power related you wonder why watch the film the film itself is not bad its another summer blockbuster the problem for the male audience is how every male character is portrait on the movie no male character is half intelligent wish this movie would have given a bit of space for guys to show
Aug 5 2016,neutral,overall its a shitty movie i  enjoyed it visually
Aug 5 2016,negative,disposable characters and cameo appearances visually appealing not with the cartoonish cgi but overall a throw away film leslie jones would be the only reason i would watch ghostgarbage again
Aug 5 2016,positive,i liked it i loved the original ones better but this new one is great too they didnt just copy thw story or the characters they actually made it their own thats something to appreciate
Aug 5 2016,positive,its one of the best movies ive seen also the greenscreen and edits are awesome
Aug 5 2016,negative,not as bad as the trailers would have you believe however this is essentially a 90 minute papa johns commercial with weak humor terrible special effects and utter disdain for the source material  combine that with sony and paul feigs sleezy and divisive marketing techniques and ghostbusters2016 is not only a financial failure but a film that has stained both sonys reputation and the ghostbusters franchise in a way that will follow them for years to come
Aug 5 2016,negative,probably the worst movie i have ever seen
Aug 5 2016,negative,this movie makes the video games look great and the video games are terrible
Aug 5 2016,neutral,this sucks way too feminist
Aug 5 2016,positive,really wish they had enough confidence to make this movie without constantly propping themselves on the crutch of the  original fantastic actors and new effects couldve made for a great film i instead it felt vaguely apologetic throughout
Aug 5 2016,negative,lame these women deserved such better writing i already forgot that i saw this film
Aug 5 2016,positive,great movie with lots of laughs
Aug 5 2016,positive,when the decision was announced to make a new ghostbusters movie with an all new cast  and a whole new premise it seemed to me the best route to take since the movie had gone through such a troubled preproduction journey  time passed and voila what do we have at first we got a trailer that honestly did hurt the movie a lot in terms of giving an idea that was not what the movie is actually like the movie even though its based on the ghostbusting concept we all know and love is an entirely different take on this beloved franchise the movie holds quite well on its own especially the cast the cast worked perfectly on screen you can tell that there was chemistry between all of them  director paul fieg took a very corageous step in taking the helm in crafting this new story that again hold on its own and does not need to be compared to the original because its an all new ride that fans can enjoy if they let go of all prejiduce but also its directed towards a new generation of fans who loved it i can tell you about kids after the seeing the post credit scene were jumping and cheering to the fact another movie is coming i give it 5 stars not because its perfect no movie is but because risks were taken in order to bring it into fruition in spite of all the odds and life has been given again to a franchise that had been dormant for so long
Aug 5 2016,negative,i have never in my life before walked out of a movie theater but this movie was so bad me and all my friends left the theater after less then 40 minutes i have watched bad movies before and sometimes watch movies cause theyre bad and can enjoy how bad they are but this movie was not funny not interesting not enjoyable and you should absolutely not go see it
Aug 5 2016,positive,i liked it more than i thought i would  i laughed beginning to end enjoyed the boys to the original and the cameos as well  but overall i was surprised to find it had its own fun personality and didnt attempt to copy the original just take elements and adapt accordingly  it will never change my love of the original but i greatly enjoyed it on its own as a fun story with fully formed interesting and most of all funny  characters  i especially loved everything about kate mckinnon and her character specifically  overall i recommend this film highly
Aug 5 2016,positive,i have been a gb fan from way back and now my kids love them too i went into this movie with the expectations of being entertained by some of my favorite comedic ladies the new gb did not disappoint i loved the cameos i loved the tiebacks to the original movies and i loved all humor from a womens pov we need more family friendly movies that are not cartoons great job guys
Aug 5 2016,neutral,no real point to this other than it was a pretty light show
Aug 5 2016,negative,yeah only star this gets is for nostalgic value the acting is no good plot is flimsy they turned the marshmallow man into a hunted airballon i mean at first the ghost look good and make sense but the second they start coming out as dragons and weird parade ghost i was like this is stupid
Aug 5 2016,positive,having grown up with the real ghostbusters i so wanted to hate this movie  i went in with the mindset that there is no way it can be as good as the original  i was wrong  nothing bests a classic but i loved this movie  my husband who is the most critical person i know loved this movie  my kids loved this movie  we saw it twice at the theater opening weekend  i had so much fun pointing out all the cameos to my kids and explaining ties to the original  holtzman was so my favorite and i do believe the lickingthegun fight scene was hands down my favorite  i only knocked off half a star because they never said dont cross the streams  sounds petty but i so kept trying to interject it during the film  but overall this was still a great movie
Aug 5 2016,negative,one of the most unfunny forced poorly written and disrespectful movies ive seen in a very long time most of the characters were annoying or in the case of kevin deeply insulting is this really what the writers think of men in general that theyre total idiots who can only get a job if theyre attractive  you want a half decent villain sorry but the writers clearly didnt care about that either hes a sad loner who talks to himself about how much hes going to get revenge on the worldand thats it and when his stupid plan begins to come together towards the end his spirit changes bodies finally settling on the ghostbusters logo for whatever reason so in a sense you dont even get a consistent villain from the moment hes introduced and finishes off as an obvious cgi mess    if you want to watch a horribly politically motivated movie with abysmal writing this is the movie for you otherwise stick with the timeless classic
Aug 5 2016,positive,too late to be what anyone really wanted not as bad as the trailers make it seem id see a sequel
Aug 5 2016,positive,judging by the mixed audience reviews entering this movie my expectations were relatively low to what this sequel  remake had to offer overall i was pleasantly surprised with the outcome while it may not be mccarthy wiig or feigs best work ghostbusters honours the original with cameo appearances genuinely funny dialogue chris hemsworth was superb and a more interesting plot than the original while it may have not added anything new what it did it did well and was most of all fun and entertaining to say the least  verdict a
Aug 5 2016,negative,awful movie thats an insult to the original would have loved to seen this cast with an original script and a reboot rather than a remake
Aug 5 2016,positive,enjoyed it far more than expected
Aug 5 2016,positive,because of my bias about the originals i love the originals i did not expect to enjoy this movie i was pleasantly surprised by the entertainment value in this movie while there were similarities between the two this one added its own unique humor and style but kept some of the original style intact
Aug 5 2016,positive,laugh out loud spooky funny and a great movie for a first time ghostbuster or for any one who grew up with the original awesome to see some of the old cast involved huge smile seeing these guys dont compare to the older movies it stands well by itself as an entertaining movie
Aug 5 2016,positive,while there was backlash to this movie going in with no preconceived notions as to how the movie was going to be made the movie quite enjoyable  while there were some aspects that seemed forced in i thought it was a great balance with a hint of action  cameos abound and it was a good spiritual successor to the original movies
Aug 5 2016,positive,to be honest it wasnt as bad as i thought it was going to be the cast was good chris hemsworth was funny but made to look too dumb as alot of the male characters were waaay too many cameos overall good fun film for the family and if you liked ghostbusters in the past not in the same ballpark as the original ghostbusters film but more so in the same realm as ghostbusters ii and how it wasnt as good
Aug 5 2016,neutral,entertained me a solid movie to redbox however a pretty forgettable film
Aug 5 2016,negative,this movie is really bad ghost effects are okay but this whole movie is just a remake of the much better original
Aug 5 2016,neutral,i admit the movie wasnt as bad as i expected it to be i liked that they still used the original theme song at the beginning of the film and the cast members of the original film had a few cameos but near the end of the film it had started to get silly i would say the film was a good effort and fun to watch but save ghostbusters fans the pain and dont make a sequel in my epinion they should of had a 3rd installment with 4 new dudes taking over for the previous team or just leave it alone
Aug 5 2016,negative,this movie is shit do not watch ghostbusters 2016
Aug 5 2016,positive,the cast was hilarious  the smaller comedic moments were greatas per the formula including the first two movies when the special effects and action took over the movie lost a bit of its mojo    id like to see a sequel without the obligatory fan service  these women rock a characters and comedy professionals
Aug 5 2016,positive,if they hadnt been provoked into changing the entire movie into a girls rule boys drool gag it would have been awesome  other than that i liked it
Aug 5 2016,positive,loved it its great to see four strong female leads that dont get over sexualised or fight about boys
Aug 5 2016,positive,these ladies were hilarious the whole time you cant beat such an incredible group of funny ladies like these thought the film was really funny i laughed the whole time hope theres a sequel
Aug 5 2016,positive,not as good ghosbusters the original but still pretty funny the first one was original though
Aug 5 2016,positive,the origional with out the comedy stood as a move that tried to and exceeded at being scary  scared the hell out of me as a kid before i understood the jokes  the librarian the hands coming out of the couch the possesion  all properly scary things  this movie had none of that and it wasnt even all the funny  the old animated series was far scarier and funnier than this  this move was too cartoonish  the ghosts were not scary and the actors never really had a chance to shinewhich is weird because ive loved other film this director has done
Aug 5 2016,positive,a great movie good mix between the scary and the funny parts the cast in this works well together and the ghosts are well made i didnt know if it was going to be a movie that was in the same universe as the old ones or if it was going to be a new one so it was fun to see how they ended up making it
Aug 5 2016,positive,best movie ive seen since mad max fury road i cant imagine a more fun and exciting reboot great homage to the original but an excellent standalone as well spooky ghosts hilarious jokes and great story what else do you need
Aug 5 2016,negative,so hrorible that even if they pay people to see it they will not be enough masochistic to do so
Aug 5 2016,positive,two words  kate mckinnon
Aug 5 2016,positive,great movie for what it was if youre looking for an exact remake of the original ghostbusters youre not going to find it however if youre looking for a smart funny retake on the original ghostbusters this is the movie for you there were even cameo appearances from the old ghostbuster actors and ghosts
Aug 5 2016,negative,very corny and poorly written what a shame
Aug 5 2016,negative,so boring i slept most of the movie
Aug 5 2016,negative,wasnt as bad as i had feared every good joke was followed closely by a dud the script needed moe work oviously the cast were not used to their full potential     funny almost all the rave audience reviews were written by brand new profiles with this one revies to them hey sony hows it goin
Aug 5 2016,neutral,a movie that tries so hard to check all the boxes of the original but fails to make itself memorable not bad but wait for the netflixred box release
Aug 5 2016,neutral,a mediocre attempt at reviving a classic
Aug 5 2016,positive,kids liked it but i likes the original better
Aug 5 2016,negative,kate mckinnon neil casey and fun cgi are the only reasons to watch this otherwise lukewarm reimagining of the original film the talented cast did their very best working with paul feigs lessthanstellar material and directing chuckles are few but they wont leave you breathless cameos by the remaining original cast feel shoehorned and desperate wait for it to arrive on netflix
Aug 5 2016,positive,loved it didnt think i would its not an unnecessary cash grab sequel its its own thing very well cast and written audience laughed and cheered the whole time and clapped at the end watching it again next week
Aug 5 2016,positive,honestly its not that bad people
Aug 4 2016,negative,this movie was exactly how i thought it would be walking in ghostbusters is a new take on the original ghostbusters except the take feels is much different with its all female team and constant jokes that never really hit the audience the dialogue in this film is terrible and it seems they gave no time into their jokes they brought back old ghost from the original ghostbusters movies and it feels like a big setup for toy and merchandise profit this film is a direct copy of the original ghostbusters plot wise and does not take a lot of risk i do not recommend you see this film the  reason i gave it a 2 is for the visuals are pretty amazing ghost wise and there was one possibly two jokes with chris hemsworh that almost made me laugh but thats about it this movie could of been funny just look at the lead ladies they are hilarious on snl and on everything else they are on
Aug 4 2016,positive,took my 10 yr old grandaughter  we laughed a lot and had great fun  love these gals and their um dumb blond unstereotypical male secretarywhat a hunk  i mean who wouldnt want thor as a secretary no matter how dumb  the fact that my 10 yr old granddaughter thought he was funny and she has no idea of the blond bimbo secretary of days past was darned cute in itself if you ask me  great moviedont know why so many didnt like it
Aug 4 2016,negative,a movie so poorly made that its agenda was purely made with the intention of displaying blatant liberal feminism on the screen rather than deliver an actual plotstory
Aug 4 2016,negative,if i could give it a 0 i would
Aug 4 2016,positive,for every hater hating there are a 1000 laughers laughing
Aug 4 2016,positive,loved it had tons of fun loved the effects and the cameos cant wait for the next go holtzman
Aug 4 2016,positive,i thought this was hilariousespecially chris hemsworth
Aug 4 2016,positive,most jokes didnt hit the mark kate mckinnon absolutely made this movie without her it would receive a much lower rating leslie jones performed much better than her characters on snl and was actually the second most funny character would definitely pay the matinee price for the movie but nothing more
Aug 4 2016,negative,this film is like eating a saltine cracker  its not offensive its just plain dull
Aug 4 2016,positive,i thought it was awesome very funny
Aug 4 2016,positive,ghostbusters is one of the funniest movies of the year so far its cast is immensely talented especially kate mckinnon and the story hits all the right beats and homages to make it a worthy remake of the 1984 classic
Aug 4 2016,negative,an unwanted reboot to a much loved film series    although i was impressed with the approach of the cast towards their characters it sadly didnt help the disjointed script cheesy oneliners and the over the top graphics that make the whole experience almost unwatchable    the high point of the filmthe credits
Aug 4 2016,negative,ultimately the film is in service of franchisebuilding and to be a laughfilled movie but despite a few bright spots being found it is successful at neither director paul feig and fellow screenwriter katie dippold set up the world and  the rules of ghostbusting well in the first 23rds of the flick but then just throw their hands up and undo every bit of internal logic in favor of a stock blockbuster 3rdact climax with yet another riftbetweenworlds breached and a mindless group of disposable minions most of the humor doesnt work and aims for the prepubescent audience not to spin any genderspecific polisocietal commentary into this but not even guys doing some of these lines could make them work to support the movie in being completely frank with my review i laughed for a legitimate reason beyond something being unintelligent only five times throughout the flick shockingly above all while their characters are written the worst aside from the cookiecutter baddie  snl alums leslie jones and kate mckinnons characters are by far the greatest entertainment in the film and deliver the few funny parts so well even though the people they play are removed remotely and staggeringly away from reality and jones role is mainly treated as the token black person meanwhile kristen wiig and melissa mccarthy who for the record i have not been impressed with since seeing her in feigs bridesmaids craft annoying horrible personas for their roles which the film cannot save even with an emotionallytouching relationship shoved in as a subplot to be paid off later also as other reviewers have pointed out every callback to the original movie and the cameos from the cast of that movie is pointless and is needlessly distracting enough to hamper this films aims in the end the movie will not destroy your expectations let alone your childhood nor will it continue to carve out a pathway for more theatrical stories helmed by a female majority it just will simply waste your time
Aug 4 2016,positive,i still dont know what i was expecting i told myself it would be ok and it was but  it just didnt have the magic of the original   the girls are fantastic and get some real good laughs but i think they didnt fully have the chance to improv to their full potential not that the script is bad its just not great with a bit of a confusing chronology   the gizmos and technology are fun although they sure introduced a lot of it in a short period of time do they need to sell more toys also the music is up to par i even bought the soundtrack and will listen to it often  i hate to underplay the girls but i think their male secretary played by chris hemsworth had some of the funniest bits in the film maybe he was the only one who got to improv his ass off or his scenes were written that well  cameos from the original ghostbusters were nice and not shoehorned in they each truly made me laugh in their own way  overall a good movie just not great i will have to watch it again in the theatre just to make sure im not being too harsh  watched at chinook in 3d with sam and josh july 19 2016
Aug 4 2016,positive,if you loved the original this will not disappoint
Aug 4 2016,negative,insulting in its stupidity  screenplay terrible  effects terrible  characters terrible  wanted to like it buy my god just no
Aug 4 2016,negative,terrible do not watch  its a pure brainwash
Aug 4 2016,positive,the end is what killed it
Aug 4 2016,positive,had moments of hilarity but had jokes that fell flat not a bad movie but not a good one either
Aug 4 2016,neutral,not good not great corny jokes and the cameos by the original cast is just bad and wasted also chris hemsworth was there just for eye candy his character is underdeveloped and a waste of a character could have done without
Aug 4 2016,positive,as a huge fan of the original i wasnt sure about a reboot  i read the early snippets saying it was a fresh take not a reboot  watched the trailers and honestly felt it was going to be okthen i watched the movie  in all fairness its not the acting or the actorsits the writing the story itself  there are some locomotive size plot holes that really bothered me  and they borrowed so much from the original that it is a reboot  the first half of the story flows nicely the second half simply falls apart  why build a nuclear accelerator backpack when you can simply kill a ghost with a swiss army knifei almost feel like harold ramis wrote the first half and someone else finished the rest
Aug 4 2016,negative,the first half contains more laughs than the entire original film dont get me wrong the sucks zoned out during the last half the remake we didnt need nor wanted but still on par
Aug 4 2016,positive,saw it twice and loved it hardcore both times i loved the originals so much when i was a kid back in the early 90s this one is no different i think every one did a great job and i really enjoyed it do yourself a favor and dont listen to critics and haters who never give new things a chance be your own person and check out the movie and form  your own views and opinions a badass loved it
Aug 4 2016,negative,truly the worst film i have seen since twilight which i had more fun watch a lorry reverse then that actual film and even that doesnt even come close to express how awful this is acting is dross the comedy is well dull repetitive and obvious the graphics look out dated and ecto one looks cheap all this is even before im half way through im going to finish watching it in hope but so far not even bill murrys and co cameos can save this ive now finished it and i just cant see how this has got such good reviews the whole thing is a shambles from start to finish ive got 7 year olds at work who could write a better script then that
Aug 4 2016,negative,saw it not impressed at all sort of a shame that they couldnt do something awesome with an already well known name but im sorry it was just not funny they also could have left the moron out and the show would have been immensely funnier
Aug 4 2016,negative,the movie is an all out cringefest including bad jokes and the constant push of female superiority i didnt enjoy this movie at all and regret even giving it a try it was just plain bad they only good thing were the ghosts and special effects which were rather impressive and pretty cool to look at
Aug 4 2016,negative,the orginal is waaaaaay better
Aug 4 2016,positive,while far too many movies are being remade  and often poorly this movie was a surprising change of pace while keeping with the spirit yep of the original ghostbusters was a fantastic reimagining of the classic the humor and writing was on par with the 1984 version and did a great job of paying homage to it  this was clearly created by fans of the movie and it delivers in a way that i wasnt expecting but was extremely happy to experience
Aug 4 2016,negative,had a lot of cute gigges but wasnt really laugh out loud funny under utilized leslie jones
Aug 4 2016,negative,i like tv movies my boyfriend teases me for this i like cliches i often like bad writing i got 5 min in before i considered sneaking into a different theater
Aug 4 2016,positive,new york city is being plagued by rogue forces of the paranormal and once again its up to an unorthodox group of spectral scientists to save the day remaking the beloved 1984 blockbuster with a quartet of female comedians kicked up a ton of ugliness on the internet and thats made it difficult to judge this film upon its own merits that being said i laughed throughout the running time of the showing and i was immediately endeared to kristen wiig melissa mccarthy leslie jones kate mckinnon and chris hemsworth as the dumb handsome guy i imagine that a lot of little girls are going to want to be erin gilbert for halloween i cant say that i found this movie to be a timeless masterpiece but summer popcorn flicks certainly come worse than this and ghostbusters should provide a solid evening of goofy entertainment should one be able to divorce it from the maelstrom of bitterness that its fan community has accosted it with
Aug 4 2016,positive,what is the point of this movie  perhaps this is explained after the titles when the popcornsweepers and sad people like me who read the names of all 3789 compositors are the only folks left in the theatre  the four new ghostbusters appear in the lab  one is listening to a tape  she asks who is  zool  cut to black  yes folks theyre coming back to take more of your money  this reboot amusingly upends the genders but although this one joke runs all the way through the film it isnt enough  the score is a feeble warmover of the elmer bernstein original  the embitteredgeniusnerdcreepwouldbesupervillainoutforrevenge plot comes straight off the shelf  the new ghostbustettes are funny but not that funny  and they lack the chemistry of the originals  the script is not as tight its not as lol by a long way and its not as scary because less original  see above  and theres no sex  at all  yes theres chris hemsworth but he keeps his tshirt firmly on  no writhing sweaty sigourney in this version no sir  there might be some slight sapphic hints  even before the boilersuits come out  but this is hollywood and no they dont have the courage of it  so the result is well curiously lacking in pace  its not a waste of money exactly and you will chuckle but the boot in this reboot remains on the original foot
Aug 4 2016,positive,this flick contained all the original gags and theme the ladies did a splendid job of portraying a bunch of no bs lovable characters the graphics were great and kind of believable the movie is entertaining but nothing earth shattering or cult about it
Aug 4 2016,neutral,in a word forgettable i can now barely remember what the movie was aboutlol
Aug 4 2016,positive,loved it going into my dvd collection
Aug 4 2016,negative,i was excited about seeing this movie i remember sitting in the theater in chinook mt in the summer of 84 with all the kids singing the song ghostbusters now 32 years later i sat in the theater waiting for that same feeling and i waited and the end credits were rolling i did not have that excited feeling like i did after the original it failed to excite me
Aug 4 2016,negative,this movie is undescribably bad
Aug 4 2016,positive,so im a huge fan of the original ghostbusters and when i heard that they are making a remake with an all women cast a was a little skeptical so when i went to see ghostbusters  2016 i was surprised the movie was very entertaining and had some very funny parts in it but its not perfect im glad that melissa mccarthy was a little toned down for this role but each character did bug me at time some of the jokes  were funny but some of them were pretty sexist and to add more to the plate they put chris hemsworth as the secretary which at first i had no problem with until  they make him just some stupid eye candy for the women in the movie besides all that the movie is still very enjoyable and has great cgi of you are a fan of the original you might like this movie or you might not i like ithe better than ghostbusters 2 but not better than the original
Aug 4 2016,positive,this was the best movie that melissa mccarthy has made since bridesmaids the cast as a whole did awesome and i cant wait to own the movie
Aug 4 2016,positive,took my boys to see it tweets and we all three roared with laughter my 13yo said it was the funniest movie hes ever seen i admit to having my doubts but i loved it the cameos were a nice touch
Aug 4 2016,neutral,a little too scary for kids under 10 in places but a pretty good ride with low expectations predictable remake territory but melissa mccarthy and leslie jones make the film worth watching
Aug 4 2016,positive,its a very fun movie to watch seems to be directed at a younger audience so its not exactly a cerebral masterpiece but i dont think that was the point also i think its refreshing for a movie to have all female leads i would guess that many of the negative user reviews originate from bitter men who feel threatened by women in media
Aug 4 2016,positive,really good movie all cameos
Aug 4 2016,negative,worst movie i have seen so far this movie is a disgrace to the original movie teenage mutual ninja turtles remake is horrible and this one is right up there with it
Aug 4 2016,negative,such a huge disappointment does not deserve the 73 it got
Aug 4 2016,negative,its ghostbusters meets bridesmaids extremely disappointed
Aug 4 2016,positive,entertaining film worth the price of admission 
Aug 4 2016,positive,with an all star cast of talented comedians the new gb has no trouble bringing the fun this is both a blessing and a curse as the film has little breathing room between action sets and comedic antics for anything else    if its a relentless onslaught of colorful laughs and thrills youd like then youre in the right place but if its convincing character dramarelationships a sensibly directed horror or a well told multilayered story you might want to look elsewhere    still if youre looking to get your tickets worth in fantastic visuals and popcorn entertainment this will definitely fit that quota
Aug 4 2016,positive,fresh and funny worthy successor
Aug 4 2016,negative,this movie was a big disappointment story line was very predictable only cool thing was cameos from bill murray  and dan aykroyd only other  thing that kept me watching this film was chris hemsworth this movie lacked its luster and failed short of its promise of brining in a new era of women empowermentnot worth it ladies dont drag your significantn others  throu this
Aug 4 2016,positive,this film was genuinely funny it nods to the original while also standing alone quite well i am a big fan of the original films and was not expecting to like this one because i usually do not like reboots i was very pleasantly surprised it did not feel like other reboots that seem forced and awkward this film seemed effortless in its depiction
Aug 4 2016,positive,wasnt interested in seeing this based on the trailerbut when most of my friends raved about it i figured id give it shot  so glad i did  loved the humor performances storya great reboot of a movie i hold very dear
Aug 4 2016,positive,this movie was so great dont listen to any haters i loved the first one and still do and this one was wonderful too i hope they make a sequel
Aug 4 2016,positive,it was amazing  i loved it  it was great and anyone who thinks its going to be bad just go see it because it will change your mind
Aug 4 2016,negative,i wanted it to be good  i wanted it to remind me of goof times i shared with my brothers growing up  it was not scary  take notes from the new show stranger things  that is how you do it
Aug 4 2016,positive,not as good as ghostbusters way better than ghostbusters 2
Aug 4 2016,positive,an enjoyable and nostalgic tribute to the original ghostbusters whilst adding a splash of new colour to the ghostbusters universe despite the mass online hate for the four new female ghostbusters they all put in a great performances and not once did it cross my mind that this film felt lessened but not having male stars
Aug 4 2016,positive,great movie could have done without the chris hemsworth character   i would have preferred it to be 30 later and the ghost are returning and these were the neices of the origninal
Aug 4 2016,positive,it has its ups and downs but ultimately i enjoyed it and found it funny i cant wait to see what they do with a sequel since it made more money opening weekend than they projected
Aug 4 2016,negative,without a familiar name this movie would not be able to stand on its own hack writing forced humor low reaches without ivan reitman at the keyboard this wasnt what i had hoped for
Aug 4 2016,negative,a poor effort for a concept that   should write itself a better movie can be written for the same cast on your car ride home
Aug 4 2016,positive,ghostbusters has its moments of being funny and having an element of horror to it not as good as the original but better than its sequel
Aug 4 2016,negative,i tried to think of the most harmless thing something i loved from my childhood something that could never ever possibly destroy us this movie did to ghostbusters for me what gozer did to the stay puft marshmallow man for ray
Aug 4 2016,negative,for a film thats main selling point was being different the comedy is extremely lowest common denominator causing it to be an extremely forgettable and unenjoyable experience
Aug 4 2016,negative,if this film is above 70 then tarzan is worth atleast 55 star trek should be 100  and finding dory should be 120 which wouldnt make sense the only reason i can think that the rating is so high is due to fake praise as a backlash to the initially sexist response to the news of an all female cast a kind of the girls can do as well as the boys support which just undermines film making or possibly sony shills being paid to give positive reviews but this is just speculation  do not waste your hard earned money on this film its not misogynistic to think the film was unfunny its just not a good film it has nothing to do with the cast of women    the script storyline and lack of humour are mainly down to the predominantly male producers writers and director
Aug 4 2016,negative,not as bad as expected but still poor just felt pointless nothing to do with all female cast silly cameos from original film and completely forgettable theme music compared to ray parker jrs classic
Aug 4 2016,positive,ghostbusters with an all new twist  an all female crew with a dorky hot guy as their secretary is a fun twist  i liked the cameos by the original ghostbusters  how this crew formed and became the ghostbusters is a fun and refreshing look at a reboot  sure there were some similarities going into the theater and expecting no similarities in a reboot is ridiculous  i liked that they had no containment unit but they were developing one at the end  the new gadgets were cool  will the entire cast return for the sequel  i hope so because this cast simply worked well together  no its not the same as the original i was hoping it wouldnt be and i was satisfied when i walked out of the theater
Aug 4 2016,positive,i liked it funny cast tongue in cheek humour
Aug 4 2016,positive,its a great movie i get it why some people dont like it its not like the old ones but those people are the ones that grew up with the originals i personally liked it chris hemsworth was funny holtzman stole the show and oh my god that fight sequence at the end of the movie is worth watching alone recommended
Aug 4 2016,negative,waisted my money for such boring movie only realy funny scene was with bill murray
Aug 4 2016,negative,this movie was utter garbage half of these reviews are from sonys pr team dont believe them they couldnt even get the movie promo ad right 30 years ago 4 scientists saved new york  hate to tell you this but there where only 3 scientists winston wasnt a scientist he was just a guy looking for a job thats what made his character so kool and was a beautiful contrast to the rest of the ghostbusters jokes wherent funny plot was terrible acting sucked  if it looks like bill murray doesnt seem interested in his camo role its because he wanted nothing to do with it he was only there because sony threatened him with legal action shame on sony for making the most politically divisive utterly cringe worthy pos film made in decades
Aug 4 2016,positive,i loved the original and i loved this one its funny and action packed with good messages and true to life moments
Aug 3 2016,positive,although perhaps brought down a tad by cameos the strong dynamic of these four leading ladies rang true such fun
Aug 3 2016,negative,a generic comedy with a gb label disappointed to see melissa mccarthy used as the chris farleybelushi of the paul feig universe she can do better kate mckinnon and cecily strong nail it kristen wiig plays the same character in every movie
Aug 3 2016,positive,funny and fun much better then i expected it would be i would watch it again
Aug 3 2016,positive,gb was so much better than i had expected 
Aug 3 2016,positive,im not a diehard fan of ghostbusters but i loved it for what it was back in the day and i loved the new movie as is now  my poor chris hemsworth was dumb as a rock but i think that was to added farce biggest disappointment staypuff marshmallow man was a balloon
Aug 3 2016,positive,i thought that mccarthy and jones were absolutely amazing wiigs character was written to be weird and awkward but i was disappointed that she wasnt able to make it funnier since she has shown she is capable of it mckinnons character was unfortunately neglected which is a shame since her performance was good i would have liked to see them put more though into her character overall though i thought it was just as if not more enjoyable then the original and nostalgiadriven naysayers who cant handle change should growup
Aug 3 2016,positive,who you going to call leslie jones
Aug 3 2016,negative,the most horrible movie ever not one funny or original idea total waste of time
Aug 3 2016,negative,the movie is a poorly designed reference to the original sometimes gets a few funny jokes but is too tided up to the original even though is a restart of the franchise
Aug 3 2016,positive,i went to the movie with zero expectations as i have quickly lost interested in melissa mccarthy and kristen wiig who always play the same exact character in every single movie but i am a huge fan of kate mckinnon plus leslie jones scenes on the trailer looked hilarious   i found after the first 20 minutes of the movie i was rolling over in tears with the inappropriate appropriate jokes and witty banter from hortzmann and the power of patty compels you i was surprisingly enjoying myself and ran with it i left loving this movie and eager to see it a second time i sincerely hope they make a sequel which seemed exciting based on the aftercreditsscene
Aug 3 2016,positive,this movie was so much fun i absolutely loved it i really hope it gets a sequel ps stick around until the credits are over i think this was one of the best reboots ive seen in a long time
Aug 3 2016,positive,loved everything about this movie and how they incorporated everyone minus one from the original film it had me laughing and wanting more gb2 yes please
Aug 3 2016,negative,comedy is subjective so ill just give my opinion on this movie i didnt find any of what was in this film to be funny whatsoever every joke that was meant to make the audience laugh was cringe worthy i see this movie as nothing more than another failed reboot and sonys lazy attempt to make a quick buck the movies only redeemable qualities are its great cast that was given terrible material to work with this movie deserves no praised whatsoever and i do not recommend
Aug 3 2016,positive,thats a really funny movie with good actresses and a good storie is very catchy and actually very crazy
Aug 3 2016,positive,this movie was fantastic i am a fan of the original ghostbusters and this was very true to the heart of that one the casting was perfect the comedic timing was spoton and i was snortlaughing in places this is an instant classic i will probably watch it again and again over the years awesome awesome movie
Aug 3 2016,positive,loved it so funny and some creepy moments
Aug 3 2016,positive,ghostbusters is a fresh revitalisation of the 1984 classic making it original enough to even stand alone the characters are funny and interesting and the overall scope of the film is breathtaking i can only say that the film is way too overthetop and the bill murray cameo was not well placed but other than this well done
Aug 3 2016,negative,a truly obnoxious film it lived up to all the negative hype the sad part is it wasnt the cast that ruined it it was the writers and the infamously unfunny director
Aug 3 2016,negative,an entertaining but mediocre movie ghostbusters tries to be a reboot as well as paying omage to the original but gives us a movie that doesnt know what it wants to be even with the great great acting by everybody with the scene stealer being kate mckinnon ghostbusters is not a very good movie but it isnt a terrible movie either
Aug 3 2016,neutral,the new ghostbusters movie has a solid group of main leads and some of the jokes and writing hit really hard but other times its flat stupid and the jokes just dont land sometimes it has okay special effects and interesting visuals but does not compare to the original and sometimes it differs from the original and other times its a beat by beat remake trying to bank on and recapurte the original
Aug 3 2016,positive,took my 7 year old son to waych it a honorable sequeladaptation of the classic with some originality and good pace the characters connect well with each other and though the vilain is somewhat weak the movie surpased my expectations
Aug 3 2016,positive,went to see it for melissa and was gladly surprised by kate mckinnon  positives female power cast master props to kate mckinon  negatives didnt have as much kick as original but that was to be espected
Aug 3 2016,positive,the all female lead reboot of the beloved ghostbusters has been one of the most talked about reboots of possibly all time with every person seeming to have different thoughts on it does the ghostbusters reboot come out taking names or does it fail as many would hope to see it    we follow two lifelong paranormal enthusiasts erin gilbert and abby yates who after finally seeing a ghost in the flesh enlist the help of nuclear engineer jillian holtzmann and subway worker patty tolan who sees a ghost along with them in a hunt to save new york city from a potential ghost overhaul the story itself isnt entirely the main focus here for the most part it does what it needs to progress through and does a good job at that    what many want to see is how these 4 woman don the suits to battle ghosts and i must say they all did a fantastic job at it the chemistry between melissa mccarthy kristen wiig kate mckinnon and leslie jones is great they all appear to truly enjoy themselves in this and the dialog with them all flows smoothly mccarthy and wiig stick to their normal characters for the most part while mckinnon might be the stand out performance female wise mckinnon as almost the mad scientist of the group gives a wild and zany performance often leading to what appears as random memorable scenes with her character leslie jones as well as the tough girl of the group leads a handful of memorable scenes with her character i feel like these four woman gave a hell of a performance given all the high standards people were giving them to live up to the ghostbusters as well have a male in the group as the office assistant as well in the form of chris hemsworth hemsworth here play the good looking but ultimately brain dead character and often times stealing the show when in a scene with his dumb logic or therefore lack of he was a great choice to throw in for some comic relief    on the action side of things the film does a good job with the ghost cgi scenes making them look good the action scenes flow well and we are given a different range of weapons and tools displayed to see in action the film isnt all action though as there are mainly two big ghost scenes in the film with some filler between it so dont expect nonstop action we are given though a lot of cameos from ghosts and other actors though to watch out for    i do have to put though that fall out boys cover of the ghostbusters theme that is played in the movie is horrendous and should of never been done it is almost laughably bad    overall the ghostbusters reboot isnt bad by any means people will hate regardless but looking at it this film isnt bad by any means with a great female lead cast giving memorable performances and some good action scenes the ghostbusters reboot is worth giving a shot      score  710    
Aug 3 2016,positive,fantastic remake smart self aware and totally at ease with its 80s identity the girls are accomplished comedians in their own right and the scene stealer is chris thor loved it
Aug 3 2016,positive,so good so refreshing to see an all female cast doing all of the action and all of the jokes really something you dont even realize youre missing as a little girl
Aug 3 2016,negative,boring forgettable  i mean you will smile but you will not laugh  too much fan service and not enough scares or plot  i almost laughed
Aug 3 2016,positive,saw this with my family when it opened and had a great time mckinnon and hemsworth were great
Aug 3 2016,negative,garbage just like the so called super critics on this site
Aug 3 2016,negative,this one did not have the chemistry between actors that the original had  the cameos should have been the actors playing their original characters ernie hudson was supposed to be leslie jones uncle and that could have worked if he was a retired ghostbuster this could have easily been a sequel with the new crew taking over for a retired crew chris hemsworth was nothing but eye candy for women and they should have picked someone else any young comedian or even gilbert gottfried would have been much better the special effects were much better but then they have 30 years of technology to work with
Aug 3 2016,neutral,ghostbusters had action and comedy   diffidently a great family movie  funny but silly
Aug 3 2016,neutral,its a really big meh and i actually like these girls
Aug 3 2016,neutral,my original plan was to wait for the ghostbusters to come out on netflix kinda glad i saw it on the big screen instead    best part of the whole movie leslie jones  she has the best one liners the best overall acting the best character    improved special effects were nice    love the new ecto mobile the way each of the original characters were introduced if you didnt look for them youd probably miss all but bill murray not redoing the originals story line per say yet almost completely following its plot line    chris helmsworth eye candy lack of romance plot im good with i thought that hurt the original duology    some gags shouldnt be done multiple times the slime gag is one if you didnt get the laugh you wanted from the original doing it a second time no just dont    the whole scene with the mayor his aides etc was a useless aside that could have been dropped    worst part of the movie melissa mccarthy  not funny her humor through most of the movie feels forced    but as i look at the overall effort 275 stars out of 5 good popcorn flick not better or worse than the original not geared toward men which is probably what the entire franchise needed
Aug 3 2016,negative,i couldnt have entered  this movie with more skepticism  i was right its not a good film but in a strange way it had appeal  was genuinely funny in segments    the real strength of this film is the girl performers who make magic out of a lousy script    its really predictable  has none of the impact of the original but its entertaining enough i expected much much worse but dont get me wrong its nothing great either
Aug 3 2016,negative,kevin was the only funny character the rest was a boring movie
Aug 3 2016,negative,the only good thing about the movie are the references to the previous movies
Aug 3 2016,positive,saw it and really enjoyed it a different experience from the original but not bad in my opinion definitely funny in its own way
Aug 3 2016,negative,i didnt laugh once what a waste of time
Aug 3 2016,positive,really excellent performances by all the actors great action and a totally fun movie one of the best big studio films i have seen in ages
Aug 3 2016,positive,a very funny movie exciting action great characters kate mckinnon as jillian holtzmann was especially great
Aug 3 2016,positive,this movie was amazing the characters were well put together and very funny my one complaint is that the climax seemed a bit rushed and hemsworths character was a bit too stupid for it to be laugh out loud funny but overall it was great
Aug 3 2016,negative,biggest meh  waste of time not funny
Aug 3 2016,positive,this movie was absolutely wonderful i just saw it with my friend and we laughed so hard the people sitting in front of us moved seats hehehe
Aug 3 2016,positive,this is one of the best movies ive ever seen with a fast pace and a great cast it is perfection
Aug 3 2016,positive,almost as good as the original
Aug 3 2016,positive,im a huge fan of the original movie not only because dan aykroyd is one of the best comedic actors of a generation but because the film was funny spooky and filled with bromance before the word even existed and i love this one its also full of hilarity much more than expected scares and friendship yes chris hemsworth is facepunchingly annoying but it adds to the nonsense of it the utter brilliant nonsense of a fantastic ghost movie go see it
Aug 3 2016,positive,i have been a huge fan of ghostbusters since i was a kid i still have most the toys but anyways i thought this was a pretty good adaptation of ghostbusters the only thing i really didnt care for in the new one is the new song by fallout boy but other than that i quite enjoyed it
Aug 3 2016,positive,even better than the original fantastic writing and cast the perfect summer movie exciting suspenseful scary funny and a whole lot of fun
Aug 3 2016,neutral,i thought it was pretty good   a little bit disappointing but good
Aug 3 2016,negative,2016 ghostbusters reboot review    ok so ive spent a good few hours mulling over  what to write about the 2016 ghostbusters rebootfuelled by a breakfast of steak and eggs washed down with black coffee i think that im finally ready    the hardest part of this review is going to be avoiding the scandals behind the reboots production the accusations of sexism and comparisons with the original i will do my very best to minimize and judge the 2016 film on its own merits as a movie although some references will be inevitable    so you all know the set up by now  an up and coming teacher at columbia university dr erin gilbert becomes embarrassed when a book she coauthored on the paranormal becomes available again threatening her position at the university by discrediting her as a serious scientist    her old friend dr abby yates continues to study the paranormal at a technical college with the borderline insane engineer dr jillian holtzmann  gilbert begs yates to remove their old book from sale and as part of the deal she agrees to join the other two on a paranormal investigation    the group witness and record a ghost relighting erins interest in the paranormal however a clip of their video goes viral online and they lose their teaching positions they go into business together and move into the upper floor of a chinese restaurant they hire a slightly mentally challenged hunk called kevin to work as their secretary    a new york transport worker named patty tolan witnesses a ghost in the subway and ends up  joining the team  luckily she reads lots of nonfiction and can therefore provide handy exposition to move the script forwardand a car    the mayor and others attempt to reign in the ghostbusters by discrediting them during the course of which a major debunker dr martin heiss is killed by a ghost which the team had captured despite these obstacles the team succeed in developing new technology     what they dont know is that an occultist by the name of rowan north is attempting to bring about the apocalypse by creating machines to summon ghosts eventually the get wind of this and track rowan down who sacrifices himself rather than being captured    rowan returns as a spectre possessing yates and then kevin and returns to open the portal which releases hundreds of ghosts into the city the nypd and army are magically frozen and only the ghostbusters can fight rowans plan which includes a number of demonic parade balloons    rowan adopts the form of the teams logo grows to an enormous size and attacks downtown ny the ghostbusters use ecto1s nuclear reactor to cause a total protonic reversal closing the portal and banishing the ghosts    afterward the mayors office continues denouncing the ghostbusters but on the sly offers to fund their research and upgrade their hq so that they can continue their work    after the credits patty listens to a recording of a ghost encounter and asks the others if they have heard of zuulok thats the story in a nutshellok so lets look at the performances    kristen wiig as erin gilbert   wiig is the most charismatic of the cast she is at times bolshy vulnerable funny cute and charming out of all of the four players she gives the most consistant performance her uncomfortable flirting with kevin provided me with most of the genuine funny moments of the film    kate mckinnon as jillian holtzmann  mckinnon comes a close second to wiig in the charisma stakes  at times she genuinely evokes the cartoon version of egon but this is sadly overshadowed by not ever dialling back her performance is so consistently intense that she undoes a lot of own good work with a scattershot approach to her gags the relentless firing off of them means that fair proportion fall flat detracting from when she is genuinely funny or charismatic    melissa mccarthy as abby yates and leslie jones as patty tolan  im sorry i couldnt stand either of these characters i have two labradors at home sometimes they have gas if youve ever smelled a dog fart you know how toxic they can be seriously folks dog farts have more charisma than either melissa mccarthy or leslie jones in this movie i would rather be trapped in a hotel lift for two hours with dog farts than either abby yates or patty tolan even if those dogs had been fed taco bell for a solid month honestly i mean it    in fact if you were trapped in a lift with these characters youd probably end up deaf as they shout a lot they shout when excited they shout when scared they shout they are happy and they shout when they are angry please i honestly mean it when i paraphrase one of them my critique is neither a race thing or a lady thing they just are that unpleasant    the only time leslie jones isnt shouting is when she is handily offering some exposition to move the plot forward remember she reads nonfiction how lazy a plot device is that i mean come on screen writers    melissa mccarthy has been funny in other films we know that she can be charming  but in this no sorry feed the labrador some more refried beans and get the elevator muzak ready    abby yates just comes off as someone you wouldnt want to be friends with patty tolan is just a poorly realised character    chris hemsworth as kevin beckman  hemsworth is capable of deadpan moron comedy and does a decent job in this with a couple of genuinely funny gags however like kate mckinnon his lines dont allow for any respite and as a result once again some jokes fall flat he did look like he was having fun in the cut out dance number seriously i shit you not which you can see during the end credits     apparently the following are all in the movie as wellthey are all so bland and or underused that nothing major about their performances stick in my mind  cecily strong as jennifer lynch andy garcía as mayor bradley charles dance as harold filmore michael kenneth williams as agent hawkins matt walsh as agent rourke and michael mcdonald as jonathan the theatre manager guess they all have bills to pay    now the big baddy  neil casey as rowan north  wow the diet vanilla pudding of bad guys seriously this is such a one dimensional basement dwelling loser caricature that it is offensive he is lambasted as a virgin loser nerd etc by everyone in the movie it is blatant nerdophobic i get the feeling that the writers are trolling the core audience of genre films  neil casey gets to be a little creepy and the ghostbuster cripple him by shooting him in the crotch uhhuh you read that correctly    the cameos by original ghostbusters cast  locations and other celebs are pointless unfunny and distract from the flow of what little story actually exists bill murray can do deadpan cameo parts with aplomb see the grand budapest hotel for a prime example but in this he delivers his lines as if there is a shotgun pointed at him off camera he seems almost grateful when the ghost blows him out the window to his death    dan aykroyd as a ny cabbie is an ok blink and youll miss him job the lovely annie potts shines as ever and has more personal appeal in her limited lines than half of the ghostbusters manage in the whole film ernie hudson as uncle bill jenkins is inoffensive     sigourney weaver as rebecca gorin is just bloody odd slimer and mr staypuft are just pure fan service shoehorned in crap in this ironically both fail miserably    so we have a wildly mixed cast and haphazard dialogue the story stalls in the third act which isnt helped by the onenote characters  none of the male cast are treated with anything other than contempt except pehaps kevin who is dumb but we can forgive him as he is apparently hot  i have the awful feeling that katie dippold and paul feig thought that they would get away with using a backburner script they had lying about by dropping in words like proton pack and total protonic reversal      i honestly dont think that they understood the magic of the humanism  science balance of ivan reitmans original movie shit theres my first mention of it there is a lot of repetition in the 2016 script blah blah class x vapours comes up numerous times we get a couple of equipment testing firing range montage scenes seriously one of each is enough talking of which    the props look cheap and lazy  i have seen better homemade gear carried at conventions by the target of the screen writers nerdophobia honestly why do they need proton frags pistols ghost chippers and a daft proton glove i shuddered pointless filler sorry writers pay attention to your source material when rebooting    the director paul feig manages standard dialogue shots well enough but is far too forced when shooting action quite why he wanted to evoke some sort of john woo bullet time type stuff with the team punching ghosts and blowing them away escapes me it just doesnt work and the final scene is a straight rip off of pacific rim which was hardly original itself    the sfx are also disappointing there isnt enough variety in the spectres  they all have the same blue hue and luminosity they feel factory produced the one effect i liked was when rowan morphed into the killer version of the logo the animated style of the art had a classy disney feel sadly his giant form looks like any other giant cgi movie monster though and ruins the start of the shot    over all a vapid and fleeting experience the cut scenes during the closing credits show us that one or two even worse aspects were thankfully cut from the main body of the film fiegs film is a disappointment yet another holywood reboot that fails to understand the appeal of the original source material and is hampered by a director wanting to push their own style into an existing property whilst trampling over the aspects of the original audiences affection     a third ghostbusters movie could have been something special sadly the only thing special that this movie can aspire to is to be part of a buy two get one free bluray special offer in the near future 35 stars out of 10
Aug 3 2016,negative,the new ghostbusters film was absolutely the worst movie that ive seen in awhile i wouldnt reccommend it to someone even if you were being taken to the movies for free or you wanted to illigally stream it online just dont waste your time dont get me wrong i love the all female cast but the storyline and the jokes were garbage
Aug 3 2016,positive,this movie got a bad press before anyone even saw it but it was enjoyable and is of its time just like the pervious ghostbusters movies  its a popcorn movie that is what it is nothing more to say
Aug 3 2016,positive,really funny with a great chemistry between all cast members song still very catchy 
Aug 3 2016,negative,really did ppl like this shit movie
Aug 3 2016,positive,really good fun chris hemsworth steals the show but holtzman is awesome   too many reviews being posted by people who havent even watched it is bringing this movie down  this is worthy of the ghostbusters name
Aug 3 2016,neutral,it was ok nothing special 
Aug 3 2016,negative,while i did love the ghost effects and action sequences the serious parts arent serious or funny and the funny parts arent funny kristens acting is stunted melissas comedy felt held back kats character was annoying the only good acting was from leslie whom felt natural chriss character is annoying makes no sense and is uninteresting until he gets possessed add the plot points of the 1st movie allot of unnecessary scenes little explanation and backstory and a huge amount of cameos and you get a meh movie to watch on tv when nothing else is on
Aug 3 2016,negative,73 are you kidding me this was a crappiest movie of the year  it looks like critics do get paid by external forces to rate their movies
Aug 3 2016,negative,acting was good but it could not save this train wreck the director should just not make movies anymore
Aug 3 2016,negative,nothing with the old ones
Aug 3 2016,negative,awful save your money
Aug 3 2016,positive,i thought the movie was solid and in many ways better than the original sure some of the campy jokes sounded forces and some characters were cartoony but to me they seemed more like friends than that stupid hand clasping finish of the first one where they cross the streams after setting up not to cross the streams and no misogyny in this one i did not have to explain to my daughter why peter venkman was stalking a woman and how that was ok because its not or what that ghost was doing to dan akroyd or the insipid harold ramis character key master gatekeeper    all that was pushed aside on this one and replaced with friends bonding more techno babble i wish they said tobins spirit guide and awesome 3d special effects oh yeah you need to see this one in 3d it could have been vastly better i would like to see a directors cut to find out what character development stuff hit the floor because i am sure they did and outtakes because gozer damn you know four funny as hell ladies were cutting up like crazy on this mug    so watch it or dont try not to be a troll because you look stupid doing that it was totally worth admission and at least a dvd rental it does not fill the shoes of the original face it nothing will but it did fill some awkwardly sexy pumps all on its own     i for one will be looking forward to a sequel
Aug 3 2016,positive,this movie was absolutely hilarious even more of a comedy than the original and its also a completely different story than the original though the remaining original actors have cameo appearances its not in the same universe so dont expect this to be a continuation of the story    the last third of the movie did seem to drag a bit and never quite find its footing but overall this movie is worth a watch but not really the sort of thing that one must see in theaters though  you wont be missing out on much if you watch it at home
Aug 3 2016,positive,a funny movie with a funny cast kate mckinnon and chris hemsworth really stood out  but too much of the movie felt like it was setting up something for a joke and then fell flat worth watching though
Aug 3 2016,positive,it was fun and funny being young enough that i have no nostalgia for the original i was able to enjoy it with a fresh pov
Aug 3 2016,positive,here is my ghostbusters review  
Aug 3 2016,positive,really love the easy laugh
Aug 3 2016,positive,as good as its original
Aug 3 2016,positive,more of an actionbuddy movie than a straight comedy ghostbusters is an enjoyable summer flick kate mckinnons slightly over the top genius is a highlight while melissa mccarthy is underdeveloped the movie touches on the social challenges of being a smart girl without being too heavy handed in its message
Aug 3 2016,negative,movie sucks because it is a sucks movie
Aug 3 2016,negative,who in their right mind could give ghostbusters a five out of five other than the lack of originality as well as its failure to even come close to the original this movie despite being a comedy is not funny so many of the jokes fall flat and there were only a few instances i found jokes funny there are plenty of better movies out that have suffered worse ratings than this poorlywritten and directed comedy it is merely a cashin on the beloved ghostbusters franchise call me a misogynist but i hated this movie
Aug 3 2016,negative,this movie is so stupid that makes me sad
Aug 3 2016,positive,some dialogs are quite meaningless but overall enjoyable
Aug 3 2016,positive,its not like the original which i loved go in expecting a different movie it starts slow but grows into a fun and exciting movie i mean the villain inst that great its more about every other character
Aug 3 2016,negative,good god take me now i heard it was awful but damn sony may not as well have even bothered making it
Aug 3 2016,negative,canned jokes a thin plot and a frying pan over the head of special effects
Aug 3 2016,negative,this was just a flatout bad movie nothing against the female cast not even comparing it to the original by itself just a poorlymade movie
Aug 3 2016,negative,money money money  also no to the improvisation adlibbing and sarcastic snlesque comedy mm mm
Aug 3 2016,negative,gawd awful an embarrassment to the franchise
Aug 3 2016,positive,ghostbusters is a lucky if somewhat awkward child of unnecessary hollywood remakes based on classics not great but not too bad
Aug 3 2016,positive,as good as the first one so not that good the first was original but very well played and cool
Aug 3 2016,positive,i absolutely loved this movie havent had this much fun watching a movie in years
Aug 3 2016,negative,aided by an invented epidemic of women haters and tumblr sony has managed to get the internet working for it in rating this movie as if it were anything better than its other recent forays into comedy such as jack and jill and paul blast mall blart thanks to the genius of sony in taking advantage of the social justice movement and the response to the horrible trailer they released on youtube ghostbusters2016 has made over 100 million dollars despite the fact that only 08 of the comments on the youtube trailer were demanding to women or childish in some way this despite songs efforts to delete comments criticizing the film while keeping mysogynistic comments anyway this movie sucks and youre all idiots for watching it and buying into it
Aug 3 2016,positive,i absolutely loved this movie
Aug 3 2016,positive,a delightful return to a familiar story  what an amazing female cast they are funny and brilliant  great chemistry amongst the actors and great fun to watch  i thoroughly enjoyed this film
Aug 3 2016,positive,its about time that we showed the next generation that they can be whatever and whoever they want to be
Aug 3 2016,positive,well screw everyone who ever had a problem with this movie i laughed throughout the whole thing it was really fantastic i dont even have a review im just here to say that i thoroughly enjoyed it the writing everyones performances every single bit in it even minor characters and actors gave their 100 bravo to everyone involved
Aug 3 2016,neutral,average souless conventional and dry as an unnecessary remake could be it benefits from few genuine funny moments and a couple of good ideas that in the end goes nowhere
Aug 2 2016,negative,just didnt have the same magic as the original hemsworths character fell flat along with most of the jokes
Aug 2 2016,positive,im loving the nostalgia the humor    cameo from the original members of the ghostbusting team is just marvelous    and sigourney almost made me choke on my drink
Aug 2 2016,positive,3  i wanted it to be so funny and it shouldve been v disappointed
Aug 2 2016,negative,not a single funny moment in this movie its also funny how it portrays women as only caring about what men think of them the feminist movie of the year is actually more sexist towards women then most men actually are lol
Aug 2 2016,negative,to quote immortan joe from mad max fury road mediocre this steaming heap of meh was a movie that i have been rather intrigued with for a little while the tornado of controversy was just irresistible to me but rather than a massive slap int he face or a huge leap in the direction of cinematic comedy or some triumphant message about feminism it was just a dull flick with little originality and little commentary i will admit that this movie did have some humorous moments most of which were centered around mccarthy who was one of the only characters that ever got a laugh sadly despite mccarthys adorable and witty deliveries the rest of the comedy was mostly just the black ghostbuster shouting ooooh hell naw but hey if thats what people find hyfreakinsterical today to each their own but jeez louise is that sort of thing getting lame the effects in this movie were just complete diarrhea i mean just awful they honest to goodness looked uglier than the original ghostbusters effects and thats saying quite a bit the performances were passable and the characters had memorable enough personalities but one of the main problems with this movie is how unbelievably bloody forgettable it was i finished watching less than half and hour ago and im already starting to lose my memory on it all in all i was not thrilled by this movie but i wasnt revolted by it either it was a safe little comedy that really feels as though it should have stayed in the writers room but hey i cant wait to see the charlies angels reboot with all men am i right
Aug 2 2016,positive,if you havent seen the ghostbusters reboot yet do yourself a favor and see it now yes its not the longawaited ghostbusters iii but its the most fun ive had at a movie theater in a long time my ticket was worth every penny no cynics and people who refuse to see the reboot i havent been paid to say that by anyone    ive heard some people say that the reboot isnt funny but i think those people were going in with closed minds curious but determined to not let themselves enjoy the movie because i thought it was hilarious and i went in with a very open mind i was excited for a new ghostbusters movie even if it didnt feature the original team     all the characters with maybe the exception of holtzmann played by kate mckinnon had some really funny moments i thought holtzmann was kind of overthetop and distracting but thats my only minor complaint the other three ghostbusters being more grounded characters balanced her out does the reboot feature the same dry style of humor as the original movies no but who said it had to its a reboot is there an abundance of cgi rather than practical effects yeah but it wasnt the focus of the movie and didnt take anything away from it its mostly near the end when the action really takes off    the cameos from the original cast murray aykroyd potts hudson weaver and apparently a bust of ramis near the beginning that i missed were all enjoyable and there were satisfying moments when the female ghostbusters seemed properly heroic and badass     i highly recommend this reboot to all ghostbusters fans reboots dont hurt the originals in the slightest and some of them like this one are actually good if your conception of what ghostbusters is supposed to be is all wrapped up in the original movies especially the first one i dont know what to say to convince you to give the reboot a chance if on the other hand youre not married to the original cast the dry humor and practical effects if you just love the basic concept of ghostbusters i think you could really enjoy the reboot as i do all i can say is that im disappointed that so many people have refused to give the reboot a chance especially that some of them have gone so far as to make its failure their personal mission
Aug 2 2016,positive,though it wasnt as funny as it could have with this awesome of a cast i laughed super hard i was scared and i love the story super fun for watching with friends orand family
Aug 2 2016,negative,just another mediocre reboot done by hollywood to make money with the least amount of effort possible unfunny and unimaginative with few redeeming qualities
Aug 2 2016,negative,not funny stupid one liners boring plot waste of money and time
Aug 2 2016,negative,didnt laugh at all  kate mckinnon was awesome though
Aug 2 2016,negative,i have no problem with female heroes but hollywood needs to stop being lazy and write new stories for women to be heroes in in the end ghostbusters2016 is just a mediocre remake of a classic movie
Aug 2 2016,negative,this movie is really not very good  the writing is just not funny  gotta love kate mckinnons performance though
Aug 2 2016,positive,better expected the trailers for this movie dont do it justice this movie is funny and the characters are relatable basically if you go in with an open mind and you generally like paul feig movies youll probably enjoy this
Aug 2 2016,positive,wayyy better than we were led to believe on the internet  dont know what all the fuss was about  i enjoyed the cameos a lot  it was too bad rick moranis turned down the cameo  i think there will be a second one
Aug 2 2016,positive,very underrated movie not as good as the original but it is very entertaining
Aug 2 2016,positive,i went in wary because the trailers made the movie look stupid but i was surprised and delighted by how much i loved it  no creepy tacked on love story great dialogue fantastic ghost effects just the right amount of physical comedy  i saw the original when i was 6 my first movie on the big screen so this one had some big shoes to fill  in my opinion this ghostbusters movie is better than ghostbusters 2 and just as good as the original
Aug 2 2016,negative,is better the old movie of the ghostbusters
Aug 2 2016,positive,had some good jokes some fell a little but overall was enjoyable my niece and nephew loved and would like to watch it again and so would i
Aug 2 2016,negative,the shit critics here give a better rating for ghostbusters 2016 than suicide squad ioi
Aug 2 2016,neutral,i enjoyed the cameos and references   the ghosts where better than expected once you understood the context behind the ghost stay puff  rowan it made sense why the looked the way they did    however the movie seemed to lack the aspect of catching ghost they only caught one it was more about fighting them which i found disappointing the originals were about catching ghosts because that was the business the only exception was gozer and   vigo because they threatened the end of the world
Aug 2 2016,negative,what a piece of shit
Aug 2 2016,positive,absolutely loved it its exactly how a reboot should be done
Aug 2 2016,positive,seen it 3 times and i loved it was rotflmao so hard loved seeing the cameos and nodes to the old movies to those who say women cant be busters they dont know gb this is the second time we see women playing gb first time was in extreme gb loved this movie and it was great seeing it on the big screen as i was not born yet when the originals came out loved each of the characters and hearing the proton packs purr
Aug 2 2016,negative,save your movie i think there were three laughs in the first hour i left before it was over i like melissa mccarthy but the movie was boring and not funny
Aug 2 2016,negative,poorly done boring and absolutely nothing compared to the originals
Aug 2 2016,positive,this movie is awesome
Aug 2 2016,negative,disappointing all around the biggest problem is that the script just isnt funny the 4 talented female leads just arent given anything to work with add to that a meandering and ultimately boring plot and you have a movie thats passable but really not good
Aug 2 2016,neutral,the action scenes are entertaining and the cast are likable but the films humor didnt really elicit many laughs from me i wouldve probably liked it if director paul feig had spent more time polishing up the comedy and less time insulting fans as such its a film that tries so hard to push forward an agenda and set up a new franchise that it forgets to be a legitimately fun movie in its own right
Aug 2 2016,negative,4 out of 10 at best not terrible but not worth spending a night at the moviesdidnt feel they developed the characters well and tried too hard to be funny or goofy
Aug 2 2016,negative,how this received a 73 i will never know  as an openminded fan of the originals i wanted to love this movie but it was a complete letdown  save it for dvd or just read the synopsis on wikipedia do not answer the call
Aug 2 2016,negative,bull honkey terrible ruined the ghost busters for ever
Aug 2 2016,positive,only watch if youre really bored humour falls flat almost all the time but still kinda entertaining to watch
Aug 2 2016,positive,this was easily as good as the original movies and had both my husband and i laughing many times it was great to see a reboot movie brave enough to be its own thing while also staying true to the spirit of the original while the plot was not without its flaws its endearing nature definitely has made this a new favorite for me
Aug 2 2016,negative,so bad the comedy fails the chemistry with the ghostbusters fail the only one who i though gave it their all was kate mckinnon their isnt even ghostbusting in the movie until the end but i do have to admit the ending was pretty good and decent just a bit minor problems
Aug 2 2016,positive,loved it a real love letter to the originals while still being a work of comedy gold in its own right would highly recommend
Aug 2 2016,positive,it was enjoyable and i would watch it again
Aug 2 2016,negative,it was a bunch of failed snl skits canned slapstick gags and a terrible script that drew 90 of the plot from the first film
Aug 2 2016,positive,funny enough to get a few laughs out of it and on its own it would be a good watch but it is a beloved franchise and it did not improve or deliver anything close to the original
Aug 2 2016,positive,this was a fun movie which did what the original did take some great comedians and let them do their thing on the screen chris hemsworth steals the show although kake mckinnons holtzmann comes a close second
Aug 2 2016,negative,how can shitty ghostbusters have a higher score than jason bourne
Aug 2 2016,positive,it certainly wasnt a bad movie it was a very enjoyable movie experience sure it may not quite live up to the original ghostbusters but a lot of people tend to view the old one through nostalgia rosetinted goggles so its a little unfair as a ghostbusters movie it fits the formula to a t and the casting choices were great if you dont see it in theaters its definitely worth a watch on netflix
Aug 2 2016,positive,it was awesome i loved it my niece loved my nephew my parents loved it id see it again and they would too
Aug 2 2016,negative,come on 73 the movie is garbage and you know it
Aug 2 2016,negative,worst piece of shit thor got them the score
Aug 2 2016,negative,dont see this movie the original was better in every way
Aug 2 2016,positive,was surprised how much i liked this movie i cared for these characters and the plot and the action worked thses ladies kicked ass
Aug 2 2016,negative,i actually got angry not only is the acting bad and the writing over the top trashy but there are cuts in the movie that made it feel like something was taken out and nothing put in its place  its just bad  this is one of those movies that all the funny parts are in the trailers except the ones too trashy to make it on tv
Aug 2 2016,negative,the story isnt bad the casting is just terrible kristen wiig and melissa mccartney absolutely stink up the movie as ghost busters chris hemsworths performance is just unspeakably bad kate mckinnon however totally slays as holtzmann between bad casting and poor character development this took this movie from yay potential to meh ok to redbox
Aug 2 2016,positive,well made film with a cast that is good but doesnt measure up to the orginal cast  ordinary writing that saves itself in the end by showing the dangers of anger and a plug for the meaning of life  the ending segment saved it from a two star rating
Aug 2 2016,negative,boo    and not the scary kind of boo the this has utterly failed to entertain me kind of boo    this film was filled with spite malice and sexism     i honestly havent felt more insulted as a viewer by anything else quite as much as this piece of garbage im a huge fan of steel magnolias 9 to 5 and other such hits featuring allfemale casts women are proven to be capable of great comedy but this piece of garbage film was no such triumph anyone who says they liked it is a liar or a political idealogue social justice nincompoop who hasnt had an original thought since their own conception    for info on the corruption laced through every iota of this film check out the relevant videos here  and see for yourself just what malice and shameful bullcrap went into this thing
Aug 2 2016,positive,having grown up with ghostbusters in my life now 33 it was a treat sharing a renewed brand of my childhood with my own kids  great job and glad to see dan akaroyd pulled it off finally
Aug 2 2016,positive,one of my favorite movies of the year so far the cast was on point throughout and the story really held together was it as good as the original of course not but that doesnt mean it didnt hold its own very well this was a wonderful addition to the family and i cant wait to have it on my shelf along side the other two movies
Aug 2 2016,negative,the worst comedy i have ever seen
Aug 2 2016,positive,my family really enjoyed the movie
Aug 2 2016,negative,bad story awful chemistry between characters  lame jokes i would not even watch it again if they pay for it
Aug 2 2016,positive,the cast is good as expected because theyre almost always funny in everything they do but the script is pretty bad there are some funny one liners here and there but overall not even the talented cast could deliver terrible lines well enough
Aug 2 2016,negative,it was an ok movie  wouldnt recommended   and its not a must to watch movie   not as funny as i thought it would be
Aug 2 2016,negative,you call this movie ghostbusters i call it i want my money back or who you gonna call call the box office for a refund message to all that see this dont waste your time just stick to the original
Aug 2 2016,positive,good film overall it is a funny and entertaining film some of the comedy falls flat and the fart jokes body part jokes are cringe worthy it is different enough from the first film so as not to feel like a rehatch of the first film but is close enough to the original so that still feels like ghostbusters grade b
Aug 2 2016,positive,although ive admittedly never seen the original i thought this movie was incredible
Aug 2 2016,negative,not sexist by saying this movie just didnt work  i liked the female leads but the plot was just so bland that it fell totally flat
Aug 2 2016,negative,it was a really nice nap partly spoiled by the noisy bits
Aug 2 2016,negative,paul feigs attempt at bringing this 80s classic back falls flat on its face the story is sloppy and hastily put together as if they were more concerned about making deadline than a good movie people would want to see the storyline from the videogame had more thought and effort put into it the actors have done nothing to create original characters for the movie instead relying on no one noticing that they have just replayed previous roles they have done mccarty spy wiig about every two dimensional character she always plays  mckinnon basically just used her hillary clinton caricature put glasses on her and gave her a weird hairdo the special fx were unimpressive 30 years since the original with all of the technical advancements and the fx from the original looked better my main question for this movie was where did 150 million go in making this mediocre film peter jackson had the same budget for lord of the rings and look what he accomplished amy pascal should be fired for allowing this disaster to be made and paul feig should never be given anything that valuable ever again
Aug 2 2016,negative,first off im not a sexist im a protester to modern day that is very symbolistic to a power hungry child this movie really takes the cake with its comedy that only seems to relate to people who have never laughed before this movie had decent affects and almost had maybe something going if they put the original cast these reboots never work we all know it and when you start bringing in feminists and libreals to make a movie thats sad they purposely made the women smart and the man stupid and only there for his looks which is a turn around of what is today women that are able to vote and have a house and are able to work and hit a guy without response is pretty much their idea of opression because they cant take a few jokes or a whistle do not see this movie
Aug 2 2016,positive,this was a great movie overall but for the adults who were into ghostbusters as kids wouldnt find it as entertaining as the original movies this was a really funny film but not a good reboot for the ghostbusters franchise
Aug 2 2016,positive,this movie was great i had huge doubts when it was announced i wanted to see gb 3 im glad it wasnt gb 3 and something new kids loved it gladly add to the collection when it is release
Aug 2 2016,positive,it didnt offend me but im not precious on the original ghostbusters either
Aug 2 2016,positive,as a ghosthead i was going to see this movie no matter how worried i was after seeing the trailer im pleased to say that it was not anywhere near as bad as i feared it might be its pacing needs some work it feels like theres parts missing the comedy isnt as clever or natural as the original but good enough kate mckinnon steals every scene she is in and its great leslie jones also puts in a lot of solid work here the other two well if youve seen them in anything else youve seen them in this nothing new nothing great just serviceable they didnt feel like they even wanted to be there most of the time to me the main thing i think this movie fails to do is combine the supernatural thriller with the comedy aspect if you take the comedy out of the original completely you still have a cogent story that starts in the first act and steadily escalates into a real problem for the protagonists to solve that has a legitimate amount of stakes applied to it if you take the comedy out of this movie entirely its 20 minutes long and makes zero sense because there is no real plot or character development that isnt bathed in forced comedy bits     if the original didnt exist and this was the first exposure to ghostbusting the world got there would be no merchandise there would be no ghostheads it would just be another summer movie that didnt bomb  was entertaining for what it was and was easily forgotten
Aug 2 2016,positive,very much enjoyed this jones bslapping mccarthy is hysterically funny and the cameos are great  huzzah for the underdogs
Aug 2 2016,negative,for the first 40 mins or so it swings along happily enough and then as in spy someone presses the comedy button and it plows into a wall from then on it becomes increasingly excruciating as it desperately looks for laughs in all the too obvious places ending up as a trite trivial and nauseatingly sentimental celluloid sellout which is a pity because if it had just stuck to its witty and endearing opening guns it could have been a contender
Aug 2 2016,negative,i had to rewatch the original after getting back from the theater it puts this movie to shame doesnt hold a candle to the original ghostbusters clichã c thing to say yet so true
Aug 2 2016,positive,dont listen to the naysayers who didnt even bother to go see it and have it in for this film since they heard it was being madei saw it and had a good timeit wasnt the greatest film everbut it was far from being insultinggo see it and make your own mind up about itthe five stars is to up an average that has been downed by a massive number of trollsit gets a four stars in my book
Aug 2 2016,negative,id rather watch bill murray eat a salad for three hours than watch this movie again
Aug 2 2016,negative,a few decent oneliners and an established brand is not justification enough for this movie to exist despite what some marketing executives somewhere obviously decided good movies start with good stories they need good pacing they also need to get the audience to invest in whats happening this movie has none of those things   i was reading a review about netflix fantastic stranger things recently and a reviewer noted that part of the magic of 80s movies from which that series draws inspiration is a willingness to play it straight  even with fantastic and comic things transpiring the original ghostbusters managed this with aplomb yes there were ghosts running over  new york but there wasnt an implied wink to the camera in every scene  they werent more focused on providing fanservice to a brand then telling their story and the silliness was organic rather than over the top it was just impossible to invest in this new ghostbusters it has the feel of comedians  performing a sketch rather than actors immersing you in a well crafted world if you want a good 80s inspired ghost story this summer skip ghostbusters and go watch stranger things
Aug 2 2016,negative,this film isnt a ghostbusters movie its just trash
Aug 2 2016,positive,thoroughly enjoyable great cast and very funny always going to be hard to be better than the original however it does a great job at standing out on its own merit and carving out its own identity whilst giving due credit to the originals
Aug 2 2016,negative,best side cool visual effects not bad music theme  but otherwise its just ridiculous to see how they did with old actors ive trying think that is feature  ive think they just hide themselves by some new personality and will come back in the end of movie in they oldghostbusterssuits but why authors just made poop on the legasy of oldquartet in new movie   filmmakers have all tools to make really cool and soulful movie but they egoism have ruin this opportunity   all the world have no idea why this trash have more points then some really good film in this year shame
Aug 2 2016,negative,its bad and its the actors fault its not that theyre women its that they are just grossly unfunny and not entertaining
Aug 2 2016,negative,waste of time and money
Aug 2 2016,negative,one of the worst movies ever
Aug 2 2016,positive,i actually enjoyed it
Aug 2 2016,positive,i actually enjoyed it
Aug 2 2016,negative,garbage  a waste of time money effort
Aug 1 2016,negative,i couldnt even sit through the whole movie it was that bad  left with about 15min left of the movie to go and i really dont care to know the ending greater  this movie was a disgrace to the original
Aug 1 2016,positive,i dont recall enough of the originals to compare it to them i will say i really didnt like the first half they took every opportunity to crack a joke and it just got to the point where it wasnt funny also hemsworths character was pointless and mckinnons character just didnt mesh well with me it got better when the ghosts started showing up but all in all i cant call it a great movie
Aug 1 2016,positive,this movie was good family fun its jokes were fresh and although the plot followed the same outlines of the original ghostbusters it was different enough to feel like its own movies the homages to the original film werent beaten like a dead horse loved it and i want to see it again
Aug 1 2016,neutral,some of the cast is great like leslie jones kate mckinnon and kristen wig and some visual effects are okay but it is not enough to save this film from being another terrible summer blockbuster and corporate cash grab
Aug 1 2016,negative,piss poor attempt at remaking a classic
Aug 1 2016,positive,a lot of funtastic awesomeness
Aug 1 2016,positive,loved it i enjoyed every minute of it i went in with no expectations and was pleased with how much i enjoyed it i even screamed a few times
Aug 1 2016,positive,not as good as the original but enjoyably fresh
Aug 1 2016,negative,not insanely terrible  some good laughs but overall pretty dead
Aug 1 2016,positive,would love to see this movie
Aug 1 2016,positive,the 2016 ghostbusters absolutely killed walking into the cinema i was worried per the bad rep that what if its not great i was worried i wouldnt like itand listen here it was fucking amazing every single critic who is trying to badmouth this movie is 100 a ghosthead with a grudge no sane human would not appreciate kristen wiig melissa mccarthy kate mckinnon and leslie jones in a movie who in their right mind would not love a reboot of an awesome franchise with an all female cast all i can say is that i didnt enjoy the villain rowan whatshisface seeing his face on the screen just made me tune out anything he said will pay to see this again just watch it man
Aug 1 2016,negative,id write a better review but it just wasnt  worth the effort  bad plot line bad writing mediocre acting from ladies that are great actors bad special effects ala scoobie doo movies and just plain trying to hard to recreate the original magic and failing miserably  dont waste your money going to the theatre just wait 3 months and watch it on dvd or on demand if you must  thoroughly disappointed
Aug 1 2016,negative,completely misses the mark  great director and cast  but the jokes feel neutered and im dumbfounded by the fact that the same woman wrote the heat  which is my favorite paul feig movie  my only conclusion is that the producers chopped the film into pieces  because the ingredients of this movie should have produced a much better result
Aug 1 2016,positive,new ghostbusters was better than original
Aug 1 2016,positive,it was good enjoyed the originals so this was a good third
Aug 1 2016,positive,ghostbusters review  before going in i had been told that although some people didnt like the film a few people with similar taste to me had said that it was good and the trailer didnt do it justice also that the glue holding the film together was kate mckinnon  i had also left it long enough since seeing the original two that i would not compare them  negative the film may have been a little long and some of the ghosts were a bit too creepy for a comedy   positive the film was really good fun i found myself dancing whenever the tune was played pointing at the screen whenever i saw a cameo and laughing out loud often the chemistry between the main cast was excellent and the comic timing was good the cast all did a great job including chris hemsworth playing the dumb blond who looked like he was enjoying being in the film as much as i was watching it and as far as kate mckinnon is concerned i think i am a bit in love with her character   over all i dont think this film is suitable for young kids but whether you have or have not seen the original films i think you will enjoy yourself it is also not strictly a chickfilm as the older gent sitting next to me was laughing even harder than i was just dont take it too seriously it is not a masterpiece it is a comedy
Aug 1 2016,negative,these professional critics are too easy on this film theyre afraid of the feminist propaganda i think this movie is terrible i am not a fan of the original ghostbusters but those movies were at least entertaining and had genuine humor the first joke in this film is about queefing  yes vagina farts  and its all downhill from there this movie didnt need to be made and it shouldnt have been
Aug 1 2016,negative,omg whats a disappointing film  i love kristen wiig and melissa mccarthy but they had no chemistry in this movie kate mckinnons character was unfunny and just weird and poor leslie jones   i kept waiting for the laughs where were they    i really wasnt a big fan of the original ghostbusters i thought it was ok but this movie makes it look like the comedy classic everyone holds with such regard     i went in with an open mind i wasnt buying into all the anti female ghostbusters crap i was rooting for the women they deserved a better script a better story and better jokes the only thing positive i  will say about the movie is that the effects were better obviously the og ghostbusters is over 30 years old    save your money and rent the og ghostbusters
Aug 1 2016,positive,i absolutely loved this movie and would see it ten more times i found it funny full of action with a good storyline paying nice homages to the original having good special effects having just enough startling moments to make you jump and i left feeling like i could take on the world everyone men women teens and a handful of kids leaving the theater had smiles on their faces and were discussing how much they loved it as well whomever dislikes this movie just wants to dislike it for reasons that have nothing to do with the actual movie itself but rather their own issues that theyre projecting onto it it was a bonus that the women in it were portrayed as smart brave capable inventive and strong after seeing this i want to have a proton pack and join the ghostbusters myself i thoroughly enjoyed it and want more movies like it
Aug 1 2016,neutral,im being generous with my rating
Aug 1 2016,positive,the online frenzy surrounding the new ghostbusters movie can make it difficult to discuss without seeming like youre taking a political stance to be against the movie is to align yourself with the worst types of folks on the internet but to be for the movie is to be for an endless cycle of remakes  the prospect of a major summer tentpolefranchise starter led by four women is certainly a fantastic thing but did ghostbusters need to updated not to say that the original ghostbusters is some sort of sacred cow its a decently fun movie with its share of memorable moments but far from flawless the cast and crew of the reboot all have fantastic track records but it was hard to not be a bit dismissive after the lessthaninspiring first trailer and the absolutely awful fall out boymissy elliot update to ray parker jrs theme thankfully trolls be damned the new ghostbusters is a success at times hilarious and with a surprisingly fresh look that distinguishes itself from its predecessors and most anything else currently in cinemas    the movie gets off to a bit of a rocky start as kristen wiigs columbiatenurehopeful erin gilbert and melissa mccarthys abby yates take a while to really pop they have a nice chemistry together but everything has a bit of a boxchecking quality to it at the start and the humour skews weirdly scatological however once the cast starts fleshing out to include kate mckinnons engineer holtzmann leslie jones subway employee patty and chris hemsworths hunky secretary kevin the movie puts itself together remarkably quickly jones proves herself here much more than snl has ever given her the chance to but hemsworth and especially mckinnon steal the movie kevin is among the dumbest characters to ever grace the screen but hemsworth has an awshucks quality about him thats incredibly endearing and the jokes given to his character hit the hardest holtzmanns mad scientist schtick could easily have been overthetop cartoony but mckinnon walks the fine line between creating a weirdo who creates laughs out of thin air while still being distinctly human mckinnon has consistently been the absolute star of snl over the past two years and any questions about her being able to stretch one of her characters to a featurelength performance are definitively answered by her work here    the movie real takes off and becomes something special around the halfway mark if i were to name a turning point itd be the first scene in the mayors office played by a fantastically funny andy garcia and flanked by yet another great snl player cecily strong the movie like the original truly inhabits new york city not simply using it as a backdrop for any major metropolis its no coincidence that both casts draw heavily from the deep hometown snl bench what really sells it all is the shockingly good production design there are some clunkers around notably the fall out boy theme and a weirdly lowkey metal concert but the ghost design is exquisite despite it being one of my major problems with the original trailer everything glows cartoony colours with a casperesque kind of vibe that keeps it from ever being really creepy but that i found incredibly absorbing nonetheless the ghost scenes are if anything highly reminiscent of the experience of those disneylandstyle haunted mansions that arent really scary but take your imagination on a wild journey for twenty minutes it feels distinct from what the previous ghostbusters did even if it does reference it a bit the final act is a neat spin on the original and even feels utterly distinct from blockbusters as a whole it was the last thing i expected going in but the new ghostbusters greatest asset may be its ability to really build a world which bodes well for its franchise hopes    the movie does rely unfortunately heavily on references to the original most of which are pretty funny but the sheer volume of which threaten to keep it from finding its own identity most surviving original cast members get a cameo which range from working spectacularly dan aykroyd slipping into a small role naturally to clunking around bill murray chewing scenery with no laughs despite this the new ghostbusters is able to stand on its own two feet and sidebyside qualitywise with the original the main villain of the film can be read at times as a rejoinder to the trolls spouting the odd genderbased insult in an otherwise fairly egalitarian film its a bit on the nose at times but its apt and just as the ghostbusters get one up on him the film gets one up on the real life trolls by just being an involving funny and overall incredibly enjoyable summer movie
Aug 1 2016,positive,watch the credits and watch out for a sigourney weaver cameo
Aug 1 2016,negative,just not that funny nothing new here to see move along dumb misandrist jokes
Aug 1 2016,negative,liberals take over a great moviewhy dont waste your hard earned money on this
Aug 1 2016,neutral,an echo  a reminder of the original  its something more similar to an offthecuff recitation of the original
Aug 1 2016,negative,certified fresh what a load   the review process has some serious issue  it needs a lot of work just to be mediocre at best
Aug 1 2016,positive,i loved the team and the gags but the plot and the execution left a lot to be desired
Aug 1 2016,positive,i just saw the new ghostbusters reboot and it was great im a huge fan of the original and it was one of the seminal films of my childhood i had been worried because the trailer wasnt too funny and i was afraid that because the humor of the original came from the characters their relationships and the casts performances that this version would not follow that blueprint and be full of random crap jokes     but its not each of the new characters is completely defined has a specific style of comedy and is funny i did laugh out loud a few times which i dont usually do its just a different style of comedy but it works because it is updated for 2016     a lot of modern comedy is marked by being postseinfeldian and that was apparent with this films humor and people have to understand it is different from the gen x films sarcasm and bill murrys selfaware 4th wall breaking original performance     and it had cameos by bill murray annie potts dan aykroid earnie hudson and the grand dame sigourney weaver but the cameos were appropriate small memorable and quirky the original themes were kept under wraps until the right times to use them they were impactful and not overused    ghostbusters 2016 has scenes that are great in their own right as new creative the characters catch their first ghost at a heavy metal concert and the joke is that the concerts audience and the band believe it is part of the show or that they succeeded in summoning satan it was a great dramatic and comedic set up for a flagship scene in the original the first ghost slimer is captured behind closed doors in an expensive hotel that comedicaly magnifies the destruction ghostbusting proton packs and table cloth pulling itself causes in the reboot this important scene happens right in public in front of a huge crowd where destruction coollooking proton streams and the ghostbusters victory itself is openly and unironically celebrated    ghostbuster symbology is repurposed in creative fresh ways such as the subway scene where holtzman discovers the ghostbusters logo in the drawing of a graffiti artist and the cineatographic call backs are also great but not too literal or heavy handed gilbert kristin wig pounds on the windows of a restaurant desperate to get the mayors attention calling back to the famous shot of rick morranis pounding on the windows of the tavern on the green as cynical new york diners look away from his cries for help and of course the original building is a lovable image on screen    i love kate mckinnons sexy irreverent divergent genius engineer holtzman i found this character to be lovable a character i want to see more of just as bill murray always left me wanting to see more of vankman in the original and that itself is a big creative accomplishment for the new film    it works because the original creative team worked with fresh talent in a harmonious torchpassing down dan aykroid was a producer of the reboot as he famously wrote the original with the muchmissed harrold ramis and bill murray said he wrestled with the decision to make a cameo but finally agreed to it because he felt that not appearing would wrongly convey his disapproval to the legion of onlinehaters    and did i mention the effects were beautiful watch out the the gorgeously scary ghost parade floats a wonderful use of new york culture ie the macys thanksgiving day parade we all know there is nothing worse than watching a movie with great effects but a garbage script and cast    all in all i cant understand why so many people hate this movie i really think it is just pure sexist resentment of women playing iconic roles the public has not been fair to this movie and its really their loss because it is funny entertaining makes many cultural references and ultimately leaves the viewer feeling good in a noncontrived way     every reboot should be like this people should do themselves a favor and give his movie a fair chance
Aug 1 2016,negative,this movie was just plain bad every story line whether it was character or plot driven was just continuously emphasized for the viewer it was just a bad movie
Aug 1 2016,negative,the worst movie ive seen in a long time  why did they need to kill this childhood movie for all of us
Aug 1 2016,negative,the cast of ladies are great its literally everything else about it that fails i would give this movie 1 star but there was potential to make an entertaining and joyful film here unfortunately paul feig and the failed snl comedy wasnt the right group to find it
Aug 1 2016,positive,genuinely funny smart and thrilling ride starring the most hilarious women in the biz reminds me why i love the original and im excited to see whats next kate mckinnon steals the show with her crazy original comedic choices chris hemsworth does his job admirably taking on the typical dumb secretary stereotype generally reserved for women and its the comedy gift that keeps on giving and all the women step outside of traditional female film tropes one of my favorite movies of the summer
Aug 1 2016,positive,if you have sexist tendencies and cannot bear to get over the fact that women can be strong and empowered be smart be black and be gay this is not your movie     everyone who does not fit into that category couldnt help but love such a wonderfully fun witty remake that does its due honor to the wonderful classic
Aug 1 2016,negative,great visuals really poor script and humour i did laugh in places but a lot of the time i just felt embarrassed for the actors having to say and do some of this crap its not as good as the old ghostbusters and its not as good as bridesmaids not by a long shot it started off well but by the ends its was pretty meh
Aug 1 2016,negative,worst movie i have ever watched and spent my money on this movie was created purely to push feminism down the throats of its viewers as a ghostbusters fan since childhood i completely disregard this movie as a part of the ghostbusters timeline
Aug 1 2016,positive,great comedy if you are looking for a true remake of the original film you will be disappointed  i liked that it was different  it still follows a simular storyline juse not the exact same
Aug 1 2016,positive,better than the original by far original cast support is amazing if you see something else check your bigotry
Aug 1 2016,negative,ghostbusters 2016 stumbles and falls like it was being held of by crutches or in this case the cameos of the original cast breaking under the weight of a legacy it cant hope to live up to
Aug 1 2016,positive,i wouldnt have kristen wiig in this role she made the first 1520 minutes too much like the sad whiny pathetic character she played in bridesmaids but the rest of the movie was pretty good
Aug 1 2016,positive,ghostbusters shines best when it is unapologetically confident and goofy at the same time it gets the business done by strapping on a proton pack and carefully aiming at its themes  gags guns ghosts and girl power  full review 
Aug 1 2016,positive,great movie fun captures the spirit of the original no pun intended while being it own movie the characters while having aspects of the originals where there own people    and i think the cameos for the original cast were brilliantly done there is one of harold ramis watch for it
Aug 1 2016,positive,this is not my ghostbusters movie but it should be great cast and it is really funny the twists and turns and character development are so great i laughed out loud often we live is such great times when studios are no longer blinded by your leads must be men the actors in this move are awesome i loved them throughout and wanted more i hope they sequel it these women are truly talented and deserve all the screen time they can get i loved bill murray in the original but kate mckinnon is so great in this movie they all are but i loved her character also the action and fx are truly excellent better than the first well done you gotta see this movie my children havent seen the original ghostbusters but i think they would like this one better
Aug 1 2016,positive,i actually loved this movie it will never and could never replace the original but it was funny and beautiful to look at at points i got chills and i kept thinking this is what ghostbusters is in 2016 and i was so pleased with it
Aug 1 2016,positive,loved this movie i dont understand why the audience rating was so low it wa s a great redux of the original
Aug 1 2016,positive,hilarious superhero movie for girls
Aug 1 2016,negative,women still arent funny   whats new   at least i gave it a chance right
Aug 1 2016,negative,having just seen ghostbusters 2016 my number one takeaway is how utterly shocking and potentially scary it is that 75 at the time i am writing this of the mainstream corporate media can with a straight face give this film a positive review the film falls so flat and seems so shoddily put together that it calls into the question the reliability and perhaps even the motivations of the film critic class film reviewers can no longer be trusted    as i watched ghostbusters 2016 my over all feeling was not one of joy as you would expect from a comedy but pity for the four main actors melissa macarthy kristen wiig kate mckinnon and leslie jones they seem like really talent people and have proven themselves to be so in other projects but here they just seem awkward and rudderless and in dire need of a decent script and competent direction i felt sorry for them as they hobble through this disjointed confused mess of a film devoid of humour or chemistry and as for chris hemsworth performance it is a painful and wooden as a b grade snl guest reading hastily written cue card punch lines in one of those bad sketches that run at the end of the show just unwatchable    the fault is not as main have incorrectly suggested that of the actors but lays squarely on that of the director the producers and sony they made this mess they should wear it ghostbusters 2016 is not funny just putting funny people in a room and telling them to be funny does not make a funny movie you need a good script and good direction there are innumerous examples of this thought film history the 1986 comedy three amigos for some reason comes to mind as a perfect example a film panned by critics at the time for being top heavy with comedic talent but falling flat as painfully unfunny     as young person i can remember hearing those negative reviews for three amigos and thinking how could this be true the film stared three of my most favourite comedians well two actually then when i saw the film i remember thinking wow the reviews were right critics used to be in general a trustworthy barometer on the quality of a film growing up there were countless films i would never have watched had it not been for recommendations of film reviewers i had come to trust there is no logical reason for a teenage boy in the 80s to feel compelled to go and see a dry white season or my left foot or blue velvet critics lead me to those movies it was a symbiotic system critics get paid for their guiding opinion and i am made a better person for being exposed to quality art    sadly after seeing this ghostbusters 2016 debacle i am left to wonders how much money it took to corrupt that system
Aug 1 2016,positive,firstly thank you to the haters who judged the film based just on a trailer and strong whiff of misogyny you lowered my expectations that much that it only gave it more potential to pleasantly surprise me  secondly fuck you haters this film is amazing id say it is as just about as good as the original if you take off your rose tinted specs and i love the original
Aug 1 2016,neutral,the best parts were toward the end it has some funny moments the special effects were terrific   the script and the characters not so much   this movie looked like almost every scene was shot all on the same day or at least at the same time of day in every scene except for the end    it felt like a paint by numbers movie that was over planned over produced and that really kind of sucked the life out of it   holtzmanns character just happens to have all of these great toys that she built in virtually no time at all not just one or two but practically everything except for the trap and the backpacks seemed to suddenly materialize with cartoon logic   kevin was a great character   erin never really seemed to be comfortable in a venture that she pretty much cocreated   melissa mccarthy thankfully did not play the bullinthechinashop persona i see in most of her films but even her character abby didnt feel very fleshedout   all of the cameos were great   as for leslie jones character patty i honestly went in thinking her character was going to be much like the characters i see her do on snl a loud angry black woman but patty was the most believable real and warm character of the whole group part of me believes the reason behind this is because the character of patty was just how leslie jones is in real life or shes a little more gifted in acting than most would give her credit for i hope this film is a launch pad for her and hopefully not for the typecasting parts wed predict hollywood to give her but ones that would help her to hone the natural emotional intelligence she seems to have     allinall it was a cute movie but it doesnt compare to the original in any sense   it tried to hard to be funny and a forced joke is never good joke   next time please let mccarthy wiig jones and mckinnon write the script   then see if bill murray wants to advise the director or direct himself
Aug 1 2016,positive,brilliant film pays homage and can happily sit alongside the first one
Aug 1 2016,negative,badly written unfunny and generally very disappointing even the cameos were unwelcome mostly feeling very forced
Aug 1 2016,positive,crackling humour  even when some of the jokes misfire theres a zinger right behind it and i laughed throughout a fitting update which without the hype and expectation would be more liked than it appears to be
Aug 1 2016,negative,saw this movie yesterday and it was fun and goofy i dont regret seeing it but would pay twice   it had the feel of a live actions scoobie doo  movie   however this is no comparison to the original and just didnt capture any special feeling by the way this started to feel like the chiris hemsworth show by the end of the movie 
Aug 1 2016,positive,being a huge fan on the original i knew going in i needed to be open minded and see this not as a reboot or remake but as something for the new generation personally i loved it and thought they did an amazing job
Aug 1 2016,positive,honestly it was really fun to watch  i seriously dont understand the hate or well i do understand why theres hate toward this movie and i think its sad and idiotic people were never going to give this a chance and its not because its a rebootsequelwatheves its because of the casting thats sad  its a light hearted nerdyfunny comedy well written and very entertaining the old ones were light hearted nerdyfunny comedies well written and very entertaining and i am not sure about ghostbusters 2 tbh
Aug 1 2016,positive,from the first trailer i knew it would be a decent movie however i liked it even more and was pleasantly surprised at how well it was made an origins story that is funny has actors that work well together and a great storyline
Aug 1 2016,negative,a mediocre and leaden reboot that offers little in the way of creativity its not bad but its certainly not good either
Aug 1 2016,positive,there were many scenes where i laughed out loud and i wasnt the only one after reading some not so great comments i was really happy to see how good this remake was great time watching this one 
Aug 1 2016,neutral,cute movie that almost makes it the movie is enjoyable has some fun cameos from original cast members but ultimately is very onelevel and falls short of being really good the four women are all good chris helmsworth isnt very good as the dumb receptionist its a role that could have been really great the movie also misses the different levels that the original had the bill murray  sigourney weaver storyline the rick moranis character annie potts  harold ramis love story william atherton as the ever annoying walter peck and a number of very strong smaller supporting characters that really made the original great this movie is very one level and does not really have any memorable characters other than the four main women it feels like the movie was put together in a hurry you could wait and see this on dvd 2 12 stars
Aug 1 2016,negative,figgs controversial female characters always put the risk from the original plot but that was not the main issue the bad thing was the dull  formulaic script that added with lame jokes that completed this to become funbusters
Aug 1 2016,positive,so my friend and i had a movie date today im a vfx artist and my friend is a trailer producer for large studio we saw both ghostbusters 3d and star trek imax3d and ghostbusters came out on top kate mckinnons character is seriously the best im planning on being her for halloween i can not get enough of holtzmann but seriously the 3d is greatthe vfx is great the actors are great and we both hope they do more star trek fell short for both of us we liked the others kind of felt slightly starwarsy to me sofia boutella is great though if they do more id like to see more of her character 3d on star trek was meh but yeahall the haters on ghostbusters can suck it its great
Jul 31 2016,negative,do not watch the acting is phoned in the jokes lame and low brow and the story is badly done
Jul 31 2016,positive,went to see ghostbusters for date night with ardyth  what an awesome movie  great animation
Jul 31 2016,positive,the problem for me with this movie is the story it focuses so much on the dynamic of the characters that the story itself is just very stale a nerdy scientist wants to destroy the world by unleashing ghosts electrifying it could have been done better and the final act of the film was just way too much it went too far into cgi spectacle and it just needed to be toned down the movie gets too big and it really didnt need to there were so many ghosts and so much going on that the film kind of went too far too fast this movie needed to be a lot smaller and then branch out in further sequels but they blew it too soon the films strength was when the ghostbusters were assembling and testing out their equipment and experimenting as soon as the movie diverged from that it lost a lot of its strength    read the full review here 
Jul 31 2016,positive,no need to compare it to older versions this one in itself was very entertaining and freaking hilarious i had my doubts but was glad i watched it 2 thumbs up
Jul 31 2016,positive,ghostbusters may not hold a candle to the comic masterpiece that is the original and it sure as hell isnt going to win any awards  but what it does do is provide lighthearted exciting summer fun in a year where action blockbusters have been far too dark for their own good
Jul 31 2016,positive,good feminist fun holtzmann is an action icon
Jul 31 2016,positive,dont go off of the reviews its actually really good if you go in not comparing it to the original then you will like it
Jul 31 2016,positive,movie was funny lots of laughter in theater
Jul 31 2016,neutral,i want to know exactly what the fuck was the point of all the bullshit surrounding this movie  on one hand i get it  a fucking ghostbusters remake was a totally pointless and stupid idea from the get go  remaking gen x fan classics is always a mistake  ex robocop and total recall  but to actually remake ghostbusters one of the greatest movies of the 80s is the equivalent of playing russian roulette with 4 bullets in the cylinder  its going to be messy and a lot of people are going to get hurt  but lets cut the shit right now  ghostbusters is an incredibly mediocre and lazy attempt to give sony a franchise whose only notable features are its allfemale cast and incredible vitriol that it received  and by mediocre i do mean it  it hits exactly straight in the middle and stays there  its not good enough to recommend or remember a week later and its not terrible enough to warrant a scathing review or even make fun of on a base level  its a cynical corporate product not a line drawn in the sand for third wave feminism      if you may remember ghostbusters and to a lesser extent its sequel was a dry comedy featuring talented comedic actors at the top of their game that was actually kind of freaky and scary at times  it was also about the forces of science and ingenuity clashing with those of the supernatural and mythological  and coming out on top  big time  there is little to none of that here  all the neat practical effects are gone and are replaced by cheesy cgi monsters  the charm is gone  the dry sarcastic humor is gone and has been replaced by slapstick and the awkward bullshit improv that passes for comedy these days  and lets get real  these ladies were miscast  for all the praise for kate mckinnon shes reduced to some outofplace noveau student art project role and really contributes little  leslie jones is an overthetop black stereotype for the three scenes they shoved in the trailer and a blank cypher for the rest of the movie  which is a step back from the last time around with winston my personal favorite ghostbuster as his identity as an africanamerican was incidental to his no bullshit character  at least kristen wiig and melissa mccarthy are aware they are in a fucking ghostbusters movie and try to take their own spins on ray and egon even if they fall flat on their ass  literally      chris hemsworth proves once again that he has some great comedic timing but is wasted  there are totally pointless blink and youll miss it cameos from the original cast  and oh yeah the main villain is a lonely misogynist neckbeard  im guessing paul feig and company figured out that making a ghostbusters remake for the pitch perfect crowd was going to piss off the original fanbase so why not tell them to go fuck themselves in the most blunt and unclever way possible and the schlocky action finale goes against everything ghostbsuters was about  this movie doesnt even compare to paul feigs filmography bridesmaids and spy let alone the original  so  as a liberal critic im obligated to tell you to overlook its flaws and stand up to the vile misogynistic hate leveled at it on the internet  as a nerdy fanboy im obligated to tell you that this is disgusting feminist drivel ruining our childhoods and must be treated with hostility on every front  but as a rational human being im obligated to tell you the truth  rent it and forget it  its not even worth the ink ive spilled writing about it
Jul 31 2016,positive,great comedy loved these women and while the old ghostbusters was cool the humor of the old ones doesnt even compare to this new installment haters be dammed this movie is great
Jul 31 2016,positive,obviously not as good as the original classic ghostbusters but it was actually a fun movie
Jul 31 2016,positive,this movie was hilarious  i might even goes as far as to say i tbought it was better than the original
Jul 31 2016,positive,its a fun movie if you completely forget the fact that an original and loved version already exists kate mckinnon steals the show from the rest of the cast and thats saying a lot when said cast includes chris hemsworth it lacks the charm of dan akroyd bill murray and harold ramiswhos epididymis will forever be missed
Jul 31 2016,negative,doesnt come close to the magic of the original ghostbusters
Jul 31 2016,positive,okay 2016 ghostbusters detailed review  maybe you didnt ask for it but its up on my profile so if ya dont like it keep scrolling oh and i fully acknowledge that i spent way too much time writing this so you can save those comments i got carried away id tell you to sue me but again its on my profile so your complaints are invalid  first of all yes ive seen the photos of little girls dressed in ghostbusters costumes coming up to the female cast members with the biggest smiles imaginable and yes i love that love that is so great i cant even put it into words ill try to post the photos for you in the comments because the actual pictures will do it the most justice and yes those little girls should go see this movie and they will probably love it and they should of course those little girls are probably not looking to provide as nuanced of a critique of the film as i am writing  second as much as this film is being hailed as a triumph for feminism i cant help but notice everyones complete willingness to glossover the racial component so the three white women are collegeeducated scientists and the africanamerican female is a loudmouthed subway token collector i mean really really thats where were at its like the film took a big progressive step forward and then an equally big step back fortunately i have a solution although leslie jones might not like my idea so much unfortunately no one associated with the film consulted me beforehand so my big fix is allfornaught  the third thing i need to address is all the insecure malechauvinists lamenting how this movie will retroactively completely ruin their childhood shut up then dont see it the only bad movie that can undo a great movie is alien 3 which alien 3 spoiler alert killed of two of the characters we were so emotionally invested in from the second installment aliens so you know what my solution is i pretend alien 3 doesnt exist problem solved and if you dont like the idea of women playing the ghostbusters dont see it simple it doesnt ruin anything if anything ghostbusters ii probably did that already anyhow see real trailers clip in the comments by the way did you chauvinists see mad max fury road pretty good  now i tend to focus more on acting and screenwriting because my background is in acting and screenwriting i am a lot more willing to forgive bad special effects than a glaring hole in the movies plot illconceived character motivations or just allaround bad performance so the special effects are great as far as im concerned but as i just warned you im not too concerned the story follows the original ghostbusters pretty closely and im fine with that after all this was billed as a remake so they were pretty up front about that  now as i mentioned i think the casting was off and i think that is what prevents this movie from going from decent to great or even dare i say classic and the casting was so wrong in so many places imo of course i think it is best to address it by each individual character now lest you think i fall into that bitter malesexist category let me say that i have seen each of these women do brilliant work and i am not opposed to an allfemale ghostbusters but if you read my review and see the movie see if you agree it would hypothetically be better if you moved some things around  first up kristen wiig playing erin gilbert kristen was so tremendously talented on snl and i have yet to see a hollywood feature film truly harness her talent properly she is kind of like a game of thrones cast member in that regard isnt wiig at her best when she lets her quirky flag fly like on snl when shes playing the target lady penelope kathy lee gifford etc yet every time i see her cast in a movie they have her playing the normal andor uptight person why why what a waste heres my solution for this movie slide her over to mckinnons role of holtzmann and let her go so there is one problem solved  that segues into kate mckinnons performance as holtzmann i guess to her credit she is the only one whos character name i actually remembered after the movie was over but the normally brilliant mckinnon plays her character like a sex offender creepily hitting on everyone and everything in frame she indiscriminately leers at men women ghosts her proton pack whatever she makes holtzmann into the creepiest pervert to grace the silver screen since buffalo bill in silence of the lambs oh and her appearance looks like the costume designer created her style with a mandate from the mattel company to create a character designed to sell more toys so my solution slide her into more of a straight role like abbi yates that melissa mccarthy is playing to reign her in either that or cut her from the cast dont worry if this is getting confusing ill make a chart  melissa mccarthy plays abbi yates and her main character trait seems to be an obsession with soup which actually does lead to a very funny line imo i heard the original idea was to have mccarthy play patty tolan the subway worker and i like that idea better i believe mccarthy is at her funniest when she is the put upon character is there anything funnier than seeing her in the kitty sweatshirt in spy or when she gets food poisoning in bridesmaids so give her the bluecollar role and let her take the brunt of the slime that is mainly hurled at wiigs character  that takes us to leslie jones again someone who i have seen be really funny on snl she is reduced to largely playing a stereotype here i like the idea of taking a black woman from tv and giving her a big break in a movie franchise that already has builtin recognition i just think they chose the wrong black female a stronger choice i believe would have been jessica williams formerly of the daily show and you have jessica williams playing one of the scientists either mccarthy or wiigs current role  now the alternate idea is to replace kate mckinnon too someone to play the straight role and i think sandra bullock would fit the bill she brings some more star power and she has already worked successfully with mccarthy and director paul feig or you could add more diversity to the cast    so here it is  character  should be played by former actor playing role  version a  erin gilbert  jessica williams kristen wiig  abbi yates  kate mckinnon melissa mccarthy  jillian hotzmann  kristen wiig kate mckinnon  patty tolan  melissa mccarthy leslie jones    version b  erin gilbert  sandra bullock kristen wiig  abbi yates  jessica williams melissa mccarthy  jillian hotzmann  kristen wiig kate mckinnon  patty tolan  melissa mccarthy leslie jones    so regardless of all my brilliant recasting work another problem with the film is that while the characters all have individual personalities in the beginning of the film but once they form the team they all essentially become the same character except for mckinnons holtzmann seriously if you were to see all of the dialogue written on paper with no character names you would have virtually no idea which of the characters is speaking again with the exception of holtzmann  another thing lacking is interesting civilian characters is there anyone who doesnt remember sigourney weaver or rick moranis from the original how about some characters like that i mean that is minor compared with the casting mistakes  lastly when i wrote my two line minireview by they way that is the shorter version for those of you who are complaining that this is too long of course if youve read this far youre probably okay with my analysis i said that this version is trying too hard and yes there are moments where you see the actors straining with the weight of the world the expectation that if the movie doesnt do well it will set all women in hollywood back at least a decade of course they do get one of the biggest laughs of the film at least from me making fun of internet trolls the other biggest laugh from me came from andy garcia of all people with a line setup by kristen wiig  so there it is it was a decent movie with good special effects that follows the original story but with some casting changes i think it could have been great and that makes me leave the theater feeling frustrated instead of satisfied and thats my biggest complaint anyway thanks for reading this whole thing please feel free to leave your comments about the movie andor my casting changes below  
Jul 31 2016,negative,would have liked to see a tiein with the old characters instead of just cameos as unrelated characters  otherwise its the same story as the first but with female characters and not as funny  disappointing
Jul 31 2016,positive,a lot of laughs the new ghostbusters are great  the ghost part of the script was a bit of a bore
Jul 31 2016,negative,melissa mccarthy and kristen wiig play same characters they always are never heard of lesli jones dont imagine i will hear much after this kate mckinnon character was really the only funny one in the movie cameos by original cast was good but was countered with chris hemsworth playing a mentally handicapped person makes this movie not worth seeing
Jul 31 2016,positive,a lot of fun  liked the updated original storyline
Jul 31 2016,positive,im about as die hard of a fan of the original films as you could meet and i thought this movie was pretty good  great humor and a good story  some of the cgi was kinda bad and the cut scenes where they would drive the ecto1 to jobs seemed kinda low budget but overall i enjoyed it a lot  if your comparing it to the originals there are several things it doesnt do the originals also had a good amount of darkness and gravity to the situations while this one is just a straight comedy but otherwise its a good movie on its own
Jul 31 2016,negative,this was absolutely unnecessary badly written and almost aggressively bland i was more than willing to give this a shot but it was just so poorly directed i feel bad for each and every actor in this movie almost every jokes falls painfully flat i felt drained walking out of this movie ugh
Jul 31 2016,positive,i found it entertaining with several laughs
Jul 31 2016,positive,extremely better than i was expecting
Jul 31 2016,positive,a fun film undeserving of the mass hate
Jul 31 2016,positive,that was amazing but it wasnt really funny just surprised
Jul 31 2016,positive,a lot different than the original but still very funny
Jul 31 2016,positive,it was a good movie all around but it just seamed off if the makes any sense
Jul 31 2016,negative,terrible movie in many many ways dont waste your time
Jul 31 2016,positive,this was a fun movie i know a lot of viewers are measuring against the original movie its not a sequel  we enjoyed the movie and characters within it 6 of us went and 6 of were glad we went
Jul 31 2016,positive,best comedic actresses working today  special effects very satisfying
Jul 31 2016,negative,this movie has its moments but it seems forced at times when members of the original cast make cameos if they felt the need to show their faces they should have just wrote a script called ghostbusters 3
Jul 31 2016,positive,i thought it was an enjoyable reboot the leading women had chemistry and generally kicked spectral booty
Jul 31 2016,positive,better than i had expected funny and entertaining once you get over the fact that it is not nor will it ever be the original ghostbusters you can allow yourself to enjoy the movie its not great its not bad its good
Jul 31 2016,positive,effects a bit rubbish but the relationships between the characters made it worthwhile fab to see would love to see more kickass women rather than another spiderman reboot
Jul 31 2016,positive,better than i expected
Jul 31 2016,neutral,this movie was predictable but it was entertaining i see why the liberal critics gave it such high marks
Jul 31 2016,negative,in short epic fail it wasnt funny at all terrible plot i still cannot fathom why it is rated 73 1984 ghostbusters was really fun but this movie didnt do justice to that paul feig made funny movies but this one failed in epic proportions it didnt add anything to the franchise   dont waste your hardearned money on it
Jul 31 2016,neutral,in one word terrible    in four words what did they do
Jul 31 2016,positive,smart and funny  if you dont enjoy this movie its either because youre not perceptive enough to get the jokes or you have no taste  i was chuckling at pretty much every line til 23 of the way through  then the action really picked up in heavycgi overthetop ridiculous typically 21st century cinematic fashion  see it in the theater  its so worth it
Jul 31 2016,positive,its an enjoyable time not great but is fun
Jul 31 2016,positive,not that bad i love the cameos
Jul 31 2016,positive,good reboot to movie didnt like how dumb they made helmsworths character it was fun to watch the girls interpret their characters
Jul 31 2016,negative,it was fun again a case with so much potential with the talent but not executed  kate mckinnon and chris hemsworth make this movie worth watching
Jul 31 2016,negative,a major disappointment and too much feminazi elements  jokes soso i almost fell asleep in the cinema
Jul 31 2016,positive,very funny remake with cameo appearances
Jul 31 2016,positive,paying respectful tribute to the classic original without feeling like a slave to nostalgia the new ghostbusters boldly forges its own trail offering up hearty portions of engaging supernatural action memorable characters and hearty bellylaughs along the way
Jul 31 2016,positive,it may not be as good as the original ghostbusters but it sure does a good job as an standalone movie
Jul 31 2016,negative,i held back on seeing this out of fear of it being an atrocity compared to the original and was pulled to see it by a friend so now i can give an honest review all of the actresses in this movie are great when they are in other movies the script in this movie was absolutely horrendous the only real drawing points were the references to the original feeding off the fame built by those before them the two actresses who are usually the funniest melissa mccarthy and kristen wiig were both relatively boring the most impressive was kate mckinnon who was a surprising edition leslie jones came off too strong and not nonchalant like the original humor was delivered the whole entire story is mediocre at best and the first hour and 15 minutes of the film will have you snoring
Jul 31 2016,negative,this is not the original ghostbusters they at least make that clear despite some really good casting in regards to abby holtzmann erin and patty the entire rest of the cast falls flat the bad guy rowan is doing this because he was overlooked and abused in the big city and comes off as more of a crybaby than a threat kevin is an insult to menwas janine like this in the original no the ghostbusters break their own rules in regards to trapping the ghosts now they just blast to death blastthemtodeath wtf do the ghosts go after they die arent they just coming back i think the biggest insultsare the cameos i wont ruin thembecause they are so shortand so pointless that i wonder why they even bothered money most likely there was a chance for this to be a good movie with modern special effects great casting choices and alterations to the ghostbuster techbut instead this is what is created and you how the guts to put harold ramiss name on this a bust of him is seen in a less than 3 sec passing shotyou didnt even focus on it a real wasted opportunity here
Jul 31 2016,positive,perfectly entertaining and goofy
Jul 31 2016,negative,a proper reboot of the franchise would have required more imagination than this disappointing and unnecessary remake could possibly muster while the special effects were interesting the film lacks originality and wit as if its only contribution is the rather simple though surprisingly controversial casting of women in the male roles as such the talent of the cast doesnt come through as the lead actresses rehearse some pretty tired and mostly unfunny lines while the film slavishly rehashes the original story a waste of talent money and time
Jul 31 2016,positive,i can see why people hate it also why some likes it its a comedy dont compare to the original than its not so bad
Jul 31 2016,positive,this was a delightful change from the original  we enjoyed the changes in the story line and really enjoyed the humor great job ladies
Jul 31 2016,positive,this movie was better than i thought it was going to be
Jul 31 2016,positive,if i could stop comparing this film to the original id enjoy it more in 10 years it will be a cult favorite
Jul 31 2016,negative,garbage movie  should have had the old crew instead of this female power crap
Jul 31 2016,positive,enjoyed this very much
Jul 31 2016,negative,in one word crap   what an insult to the classic  use your money wisely and go see hillarys america instead now thats a real movie
Jul 31 2016,positive,loved it it wasnt a total remake of the original but did an excellent job of paying homage to it and included all the original cast except rick moranis very well done
Jul 31 2016,positive,the funniest ghostbusters movie so far
Jul 31 2016,positive,did everyone see a different movie these reviews read like group think this movie was a blast and a half i had so much fun watching it the cameos are subtle which i appreciated as oftentimes those things can be really cheesy and pull you out of the film it was a ghostbusters movie through and through envoking the spirit of the originals instead of being haunted by it mckinnons holtzman is a thrill ride in and of its self she is mesmerizing in the role i was cracking up in the theater throghout the entire thing as a massive fan of the ghostbusters franchise i thought the callbacks were tasteful and funny and additive it adds a fun and refreshing jolt to franchise while maintaining the beloved quirky bombast of the original it is easily one of the best reboots i have ever seen ooooo and the fight scenes and weapons are so cool i am 30 and i transformed into a very excited 7 year old while watching this movie if you are a big fan of the originals you will love this movie
Jul 31 2016,positive,i was thoroughlly entertained by this movie
Jul 31 2016,negative,these people are honestly talented actors mccarthy mckinnon jones and wiig are all funny people my issue is just   its not a well put together film people all four of the main cast are written as almost the same character the jokes dont land and the pacing is just awful this has nothing to do with the cast or their genders its just a bad script the material these people have been given is just nothing they can really work with support these people in their other works not this one
Jul 31 2016,positive,funny and entertainings even if it doesnt necessarily justify its own existence ghostbusters has a great cast and director along with top notch visual effects and enough cameos to give its audience plenty of nostelgic feelings ghostbusters is worth the ticket but may not need a second viewing anytime soon after
Jul 31 2016,negative,all the pieces were in place for a huge hit movie actors producers director successful franchise original actors making a cameo movie demographics etc unfortunately the writing was no better than b movie quality
Jul 31 2016,positive,amazing on every single level funny scary badass no idea what people are complaining about
Jul 31 2016,positive,i dont usually bother leaving reviews but i felt like i needed to this time i really really enjoyed this movie it was funny and well put together i do feel like it would have done better as a movie  standing on its own it didnt need the ghostbusters name all of the main cast were brilliant in their roles the other characters not as much the mayors female assistant felt forced and almost slimy which possibly may have been what they were going for i find myself hoping that they do a sequel where they come up with additional technology and  explore the interpersonal relationships more go watch it and ignore all the bad reviews from people who havent even seen it
Jul 31 2016,negative,why do i get the feeling that the high tomatometer ratings from critics is primarily due to political correctness and not because of the actual worth of the movie
Jul 31 2016,positive,loved it scarier than the originals and at least as funny if not funnier an excellent cast give solid performances with jokes ranging from dry humour through to slapstick and fart jokes and everything in between excellent cameos and references to the originals tick all the nostalgia boxes with a new story so it stands alone ive been back to see it again and again cant wait for a sequel
Jul 31 2016,negative,decent movie obviously not better than the classics
Jul 31 2016,positive,this team just deserves a sequel
Jul 31 2016,neutral,spoiler alert    there will be spoiler references so no complaining if you read past this    when i heard there was going to be a ghostbusters 3 i was ecstatic when i heard it was then going to be a reboot i was a little sad that the torch isnt being passed on in film but spirit    now when i heard it was going to be an all woman team i was all for it    thing is the team isnt really diverse like they state if it was diverse they would have equal men and women and i believe there should at least be one hispanic person seeing as the united states is the secondlargest hispanophone country in the world after mexico with a diverse group like that a dumb blond male secretary would be bearable     now about the movie     if you loved the real ghostbusters cartoon or extreme ghostbusters then youll love this movie the physics and science get a bit cartoonie near the end of the movie with a no trap ghost fight not to mention the easy slide to a cartoon series with action figures and gadgets to buy galore    speaking of cartoonie the villain was a bit too cartoonie for my liking and there was some live action nickelodeon comedy just go try and watch some and youll see what i meanthe army disco is a good example in the movie  i mean if he was working for another big deamon or ghost or creature from another dimension that he was in contact with after pouring over their book a bunch and he had to break the barrier to free it then that would have made sense and been a bit better it feels like it was kinda just thrown in    i dont see the complaint that all men in the movie are jerks or dumb ive watched this movie 7 times now and i have replaced the 4 women with men and kevin as a woman and left everyone else the same and it would have been the same the only outrage would have been the dumb blond    all in all the jokes are mainly toilet humour looks like idiocracy wasnt too far off there are some good laughs but nothing special the bird flipping scene caught me off guard and i laughed     nothing scary about the movie the cartoons were scarier then this seriously go back and watch the episodes before season 4    they should have focused more on the script less toilet humour and for diversity  holtzmann woild stay and i would have made her a paternal twin with a brother who is apart of the team and they have a hispanic woman friend from highschool with them  maybe a lesbian i dont know im still kicking that around and patricia would still be kinda the same just a mechanic she has a place in her shop for them above the garage and is more of a real person
Jul 31 2016,positive,better than i expected but still nowhere near as good as the original dan ackroyd  harold ramis were involved mind you christin wiig  mccarthy were their usual brand of comedy  good but nothing new kate mckinnon was underutilized as the goofy bill murray counterpart she was quite enjoyable leslie jones plays the stereotypical inner city street smart woman which hurts the movies credibility the most its like some out of touch movie exec said lets show the kids of today that even girls can bust ghosts and we need to include one of them negros  chris hemsworth plays a dumb nerdy secretary but its not funny as his gags arent funny hes sort of the rick moranis character esp since hes sucked deeper into the plot towards the end in almost the same way there are some fun shout outs to the original including a few surprise guests one of which all original fans will get another few that may slip past but in the end you dont end up cheering for the triumphant team they dont even use the original movie music much they just hint at it which is another shame as that became an anthem for the entire summer back then if you cant surpass or at least equal the original then why make it  i guess i dont expect a flood of gb merchandise it wouldve been an awesome sequel to the original if it had the original cast and was done back then
Jul 31 2016,positive,well its not the original lets just get that out of the way first off but and there is a but its actually alright the girls have great chemistry together and kate mckinnon is an absolute stand out  i wish they plugged it with more of her jokes its as visual as youd expect it to be and the storyline is engaging enough although the ending is a bit naff but if youve seen the originals youll have that flashing in the back of your mind as a standalone movie its an enjoyable flick
Jul 30 2016,positive,much better then anticipated and much funnier than originally shown but still pales in comparison to the original
Jul 30 2016,positive,i cant believe how good and true the the ghostbusters colors this was what a fun movie a must see
Jul 30 2016,positive,i saw it twice in 24 hours and i cannot wait to see it again the cast is perfect and the jokes are funny and the soundtrack is so much fun pls watch
Jul 30 2016,positive,a fun and entertaining film but not without its flaws its a great addition to the franchise but rarely shows anything new or exciting to differentiate itself from the originals at least in a positive way  the plot is satisfactory if a tad cliche but its nice to see a reason the ghosts are showing up i also really enjoy the cast when they arent resorting to lowest common denominator jokes which happens more than id like   i greatly enjoyed the special effects especially in the color palette the practical props were also nicely done and the new weapons were some of the few new additions that really stuck the landing  as far as direction the spastic randomness didnt really gel well for me especially coupled with the crude jokes but when the film really got into the thick of the main plot it worked out ok  all in all i had fun but wanted a tad more in the writing and direction departments but the characters and world they built were entertaining enough especially towards the end    also im in love with holtzmann
Jul 30 2016,positive,love these actresses  i liked the movie
Jul 30 2016,positive,i uttered the words im totally buying this on bluray after the fart joke at the beginning this film had me laughing so much i got a stitch brilliant casting and oh my goodness holtzmann is possibly my favourite character ever like ever  heres to the next installment
Jul 30 2016,positive,just ok wasnt that funny
Jul 30 2016,negative,this movie is terrible absolutely terrible
Jul 30 2016,positive,very good movie couldnt stand watching chris hemsworth though
Jul 30 2016,positive,people honestly need to chill out with the hate on this movie probably the only things that sucked were some of the flat unfunny jokes and the blonde ghostbuster everything else was pretty good not original1984 good but good
Jul 30 2016,positive,it was ok could of been a lot better
Jul 30 2016,negative,pushed their agenda too hard the story suffered for it  was looking forward to this i liked the trailers but the movie did not deliver  did not live up to its potential
Jul 30 2016,negative,awful dont waste your money poor humor a spit in the face of the original
Jul 30 2016,negative,one line got a laugh story is asinine cameos were completely fumbled
Jul 30 2016,positive,im not much for ghost but it was super funny and the ghosts were really creepy i always enjoy melissa mccarthy
Jul 30 2016,negative,if you like a movie that its only purpose is to degrade the role of men then youll love it anyone voting for trump will hate it i hate this movie not because of its feminist propaganda but because it destroyed my favorite paranormal comedy series from my youth who you gonna call someone with a time machine to see a much better movie
Jul 30 2016,positive,12 star for chris hemsworth at least
Jul 30 2016,negative,the only film i have ever walked out of avoid at all cost
Jul 30 2016,positive,pretty good with an original story that paid homage to the original would have gotten 5 stars if the best parts hadnt been spoiled by the trailers and commercials
Jul 30 2016,positive,this movie was hilarious i couldnt stop laughing
Jul 30 2016,positive,too many backstory and overequipped
Jul 30 2016,positive,really enjoyed the movie
Jul 30 2016,positive,5 stars being what it is a comedy we laughed like crazy  highly recommend the 3d for this one which usually does not impress me  absolutely hilarious dumb stupid fun  great break from current events  wiig and mccarthy carry it  terrific easter eggs throughout
Jul 30 2016,positive,how many of the bad reviews are from men just saying
Jul 30 2016,positive,such a great movie i loved all of the cameos they were great my favorite character was jillian the movie was as funny as the first movies they had great casting i love that the theme was by fall out boy it made it more modern
Jul 30 2016,positive,loved it laughed a lot my husband too i didnt expected and it was great i want pat 2
Jul 30 2016,positive,loved it fantastic
Jul 30 2016,negative,sucked only a couple of funny moments other than that it was a waste of money
Jul 30 2016,negative,an absolute train wreck id give it 0 stars if i could spiteful unfunny disjointed social justice drivel a real slap in the face to the ghostbusters franchise and its fans
Jul 30 2016,positive,being a fan of ghostbusters since watching the originals opening library scene in early 1985 and having built a proton pack with my own hands i was affraid of these ghosts but my fear was unfounded it is funny it is original it has funny characters and lots of chemistry and mostly it has a lot of what once would be my dream job if it actually existed  busting ghosts also id bet much of the audience score here is due to haters that vowed never to watch this film
Jul 30 2016,neutral,great cast bad writing
Jul 30 2016,negative,ruined the original
Jul 30 2016,positive,i couldnt wait to see this movie as the original movies were classics i thought the movie was really funny and the special effects definitely had improved all the actresses were hilarious especially leslie jones exceeded my expectations id watch it again
Jul 30 2016,positive,i liked really liked the original gb movie but mostly for its unique concept comical timing between the lead cast i sorta liked this flick for different reasons the characters were flushed out better in this movie their chemistry was pretty good as well it was a good 3d imax experience i mostly liked the movie for surprises mostly the scary scenes kate mckinnon i was hoping melissa kristen to lead the movie but kate really surprised me it was so much fun to watch her shes mostly a hit or miss to the audience was a hit to me 
Jul 30 2016,positive,good laugh easy watch movie did well distinguishing themselves from the original
Jul 30 2016,negative,this is what its come too  bunch of lame jokes and scenes thrown together and a couple of proton packs and they think this is a gb movie they what caught 1 ghost the whole movie  i feel very sorry for the ladies cast for this movie 
Jul 30 2016,negative,biggest pile of misogynistic crap that i have ever seen none of the jokes were funny the lead actors are either lame or over the top the effects are ten years behind of what is exceptionable and the plot is incredibly lame
Jul 30 2016,positive,this was an awesome movie i wasnt expecting it to be so funny it was a great story with action adventure and comedy i didnt stop laughing the whole time great homage to the original
Jul 30 2016,positive,entertaining film humorous great special effects plenty of nods to original not a classic but fun netherless
Jul 30 2016,negative,i have nothing good to say  garbage in every way  not funny  i hate it when classics get spun in politically correct ways and seem to have no other purpose than that  this is like the feminist version of ghostbusters similar to the recent star wars except even worse acting and missing the cool effects      if you are someone who actually has a brain and are a fan of the original ghostbusters youll be a combination of bored and offended by this trash  if youve never seen ghostbusters at all then its like a low ranking movie that should have gone straight to dvd and redbox  it would have mild entertainment value for people who have never seen ghostbusters all it did was make me mad  just like star wars made me mad  just like point break made me mad
Jul 30 2016,neutral,heres the thing with comedies if you can have lots of good jokes but they can all be negated by bad ones that fall flat it felt like there were as many times there were crickets where i was supposed to be laughing as times when i was actually loling the pacing is a little awkward especially at the beginning and there are times where things should have been cut and and scenes should have gone on longer on the positive side there are a good amount of funny parts as well as a nice buildup and backstory of them becoming ghostbusters also there was a really cool and unexpected ghost fighting scene all in all an average movie
Jul 30 2016,positive,i thought it was a fun movie kind of cheesy but funny my friend mentioned the ghosts seemed disneyesque which is a pretty good description i think i would describe the original movies to have more jim henson style ghosts i really enjoyed all of the main characters chris hemsworth was great and more funny than i expected in short not the bestfunniest movie ever but by far better than others that have higher audience scores in my opinion go see it
Jul 30 2016,neutral,thor is kinda funny and kate mckinnon is a bad ass
Jul 30 2016,neutral,this movie isnt in anyway satisfactory in storyjokesthey were mostly loudfunny humor and fartsthere were some witty jokes but they pointed it out way too much and cgi the movie was a bit bellow mediocre for me yet the effects and film making was bland yet alright and it didnt piss me off as much as i thought it wouldthough it just left abit of a bitter taste in my mouth because of the plastic feel remakes haveif compared to the ghostbuster 1984 version its shit like all remakes
Jul 30 2016,positive,it was really funny and i loved it it paid homage to the original while still being fresh and new in its own way its a must see
Jul 30 2016,positive,i thought it was very funny the plot could have been better it was like the first one kind of
Jul 30 2016,positive,i loved this movie im not understanding why all the negative feedback
Jul 30 2016,positive,quite entertaining  dont compare it to the originaljudge for itself  i laughed a lot
Jul 30 2016,negative,ghostbusters reboot is an apparition of a good movie solid cast director who excels in creating funny movies and a franchise with a builtin audience in the end though it was just an apparition the one thing that was missing and its a big thing is a damn script this film felt like it begin as 4 talented women were handed a few note cards and had to adlib every scene they were in there are scenes that work because the actors are that good unfortunately other than the sfx team didnt hold up their end of the deal to make this a good movie     im tired of hearing the comments about misogyny when negatively critiquing this movie a bad movie is a bad movie and this one is a slimmer
Jul 30 2016,negative,very boring and disjointed comedy that at best made me kind of give a ha but that was mostly from how stupid they made hemsworths character
Jul 30 2016,positive,the four comedians in this movie do a fantastic job with the material they were given
Jul 30 2016,positive,doesnt live up to the originality humor or quirkiness of the original kate mckinnon is the only one worth paying attention to and steals the movie
Jul 30 2016,positive,these girls are hilarious
Jul 30 2016,positive,people who dont like this movie are trump voters if you dont like this movie its because youre either sexist or racist
Jul 30 2016,positive,so i didnt get to post about this last night because we got back so late but liz and i got to see the new ghostbusters last night and i am in love    ill be perfectly honest in saying i decided to see it a while ago when the first firestorm of controversy kicked up and the decision was mostly made out of spite     but later on i saw a trailer where one line you need to stop kissing the ghost trap but it makes me feel warm and tingly  thats probably the radiation made me cackle with laughter and want to really see it and i have zero regrets    this was the funniest movie ive seen in a long time  and all without being cruel or gross usually and even then the gross jokes were made by women who could be gross and funny and entertaining  they didnt have to be pretty or proper or held to a higher standard and i just  ask liz i was screaming with laughter at some points but i cant even bring myself to be apologetic to the other movie goers because they were laughing too    and there were some freaking scary parts too  the spoilers mannequin scene made me squirm and laugh at the same time and the main villain was just the right brand of hateable creep congrats to that actor a creep factor man    and the acting  there wasnt a single actor or character that i honestly think couldve done better from the minute kate mckinnon was on screen i had the hugest crush and every scene with melissa mccarthy and kristen wigg made my heart ache and leslie jones never failed to crack me up and chris hemsworth as a particular dense beefcake was glorious    my favorite jokes actually were the cameos all hilariously well done and the merciless jabs at  if youll excuse me  the absolute pissbabies who blew this movie way out of proportion with their hate and did a lot of sonys marketing for them lmao    all in all loved the movie best comedy ive seen in a long time cant wait to see it again and in the meantime i need to buy all the merch and nurse my poor bi heart over the heartthrob that is jillian holtzmann
Jul 30 2016,positive,exactly like the trailer
Jul 30 2016,negative,terrible the plot was predictable it wasnt funny and it wasnt scary
Jul 30 2016,positive,is complicated to make a new history on this times of a classic but i believe they make a good work great cast and amazing effects that the original one didnt  have of course great to have the original cast sad they forgot rick moranis
Jul 30 2016,positive,i found the movie funny and a nice tribute to the original without trying to recreate it  this brings a fresh perspective to the paranormal although a lot of really long words thrown around  but it was tongue in cheek much like the first one
Jul 30 2016,positive,the good definitely a lot of fun good chemistry between the actors good villain good handling of cameos kate mckinnon and chris helmsworth steal the show the bad the editing made parts feel rushed while others went on too long weak 3rd act overall ghostbusters didnt need a remake but this one did a pretty good job a reedit would make this a very good movie
Jul 30 2016,positive,exquisite in every detail    ghostbusters 2 sucked because the basis lacked depth    this movie was hilarious as well as sifilicious    special effects were great storyline was accessible and interesting    the portrayal of engineers and scientists was much less derogatory than the originals    safety lights are for dudes    as for haterz  suck it  this movie rocks and haters swallow
Jul 30 2016,positive,i really enjoyed this movie totally love the cast and the subtle cameos i thought it was funny wellwritten and entertaining 10 out of 10 would see again
Jul 30 2016,negative,wasnt a fan of first ones was dragged to this oneeven worse than the other ones go see star trek if you need a scifi fix this is just boring
Jul 30 2016,positive,not laugh out funny buy good acting and coherent comedic plot makes it enjoyable if not epic no one will be talking about this film in 5 years maybe the next one will build on this movie and reach a higher comedic level and maybe it will be a dud anyway if i was a director producer studio actors etc dont count on sequels putting money into your bank account until the sequel comedic elements are improved loved the ghostbuster actors hated the actor who played the secretary  he played clumsy at times then more surefooted later he was sleepwalking through the movie was there a relationship with a ghostbuster that was edited out
Jul 30 2016,positive,excellent contemporary reimagination of the original hits the same tone similar humor nottooscary scary moments dynamics between the characters it also makes several nods to the original some obvious some subtle stay tuned for the entire credits i also liked how the fact that the main characters were all women was not in itself a plot point and like many paul feig films it passes the beshdel test with flying colorsi marked it down a half star because i was rather bummed by the sexism addressed at the character kevin the receptionist the way to overcome sexism against women is not to treat men in the same way not only was it present but it was persistent throughout the film and over the top overall though i really enjoyed it and would happily see it again
Jul 30 2016,negative,i could have cared less about the charactersthe only one who was interesting was kate mckinnons character dan akroyd was a nice surprise bill murray was ok
Jul 30 2016,positive,3 stars i just did not love this like my friends who saw it earlier did it was well paced but i thought the consistently funniest character was chris hemsworth which makes me think im either feministing wrong or the amazingly funny leads just didnt get written enough good jokes
Jul 30 2016,positive,this movie did nothing for me most of the jokes fell flat except chris hemsworth as the receptionist he was somewhat funny i thought that the action was subpar the cgi did not grab me over all my opinion on ghostbusters 2016 is watch ghostbusters 1984
Jul 30 2016,positive,tropeheavy reboot that while not deserving of an oscar or anything was a laugh a minute romp much more fun than ghostbusters ii or any of the rubbish passing for star wars films since phantom menace onwards  a worthy homage to the original and a subversive new direction in onscreen female heroics great family fun
Jul 30 2016,negative,it was a sad cash grab filled with flat characters and jokes that just didnt make sense for the characters  its to bad all these great people got involved with sony
Jul 30 2016,negative,this movie tries to capitalize off of a much greater film by spinning a political agenda of women are funny on it
Jul 30 2016,negative,i dont know where to start this was garbage paid no honor to ghostbusters and completely ruined the concept they only caught one fucking ghost then blew up the rest with the invention that was meant to trap   ghostslike how do you go against your own rule terrible chemistry they made all the men idiots or complete assholes and not one character was likable this director was obviously trying to piss off the original fans because he did a great job of doing that i usually never give films this bad a review but when you mess with my childhood you crossed the line complete trash
Jul 30 2016,positive,wonderfully hilarious and different i loved it so much better than the original it truly is its own movie and not just another remake
Jul 30 2016,negative,this movie could not live up to the hype it felt like it was trying to be something that ghostbusters just is not i will say what i likedleslie jones loved her she brought the most to the role she was given and even chris hemsworthdamn is he funny with the one note character he has lastly and surprisingly the end credits of this movie were fantastic i had fun watching them but that says a lot right there the end credits had more care put into them than the movie itself ghostbusters 2016 tries to hard to be a modern jump scare comedy rather than tellingshowing a good story with compelling relatable characters weak direction and sloppy editing and poor storytelling is what hurt this movienot the fact there are women ghostbusters
Jul 30 2016,positive,once i got over the fact the cast were all female and not as funny as original crew then i started to enjoy it by the end i was left satisfied and pleasantly surprised
Jul 30 2016,negative,horrible where do i get that 2 hours of my life back harold ramos must be rolling in his grave
Jul 30 2016,positive,solid effort wasnt terrible just didnt quite hit the mark 
Jul 30 2016,positive,fun but stupid at points
Jul 30 2016,positive,it does what it says on the tin i really enjoyed it and i liked the orignals  too
Jul 30 2016,positive,as a kid of the 80s the ghostbusters franchise had a lasting impression on me with the animated series and the movies so i was indeed happy to be seeing the franchise back on the screen again with this remake ive come to learn that similar to the original movie this remake has an snlfilled cast as well some of the comedic gags are far too silly especially with chris hemsworth but there are enough laughs to keep the movie going of course it can be critised that the plot is far too similar to the original and hardly brings anything new but i still feel like giving it a free pass just for being able to see more ghostbusting action once again
Jul 30 2016,negative,ok so i trundled along to see this film and i did it with some excitement as i expected a lot but was very sceptic about if they could pull it off  i mean cmon its the ghostbusters  the originals and i still like the second one are the hallmarks of comedy cinema in the 80s and i couldnt wait to see what the next instalment held  mccarthy has made a few funny films of late and i love mike and molly  kristen wiig is very funny too and her role in hello ladies was gold  i figured there was a lot going for it i was enthralled with the opening scenes with zach woods and i felt like my scepticism was misplaced and the ride started    but unfortunately it all turned bad for me about there  despite some decent comedy acting the story just didnt really hold up for me  the special effects were fine but to go on a ghost killing rampage the way mccarthy had to was really getting ridiculous  chris hemsworth must have lost a bet or the producer had some compromising photos of him or something  there are some characters that are played to look dumb but this one was simply annoying  every scene he was in was just irritating  there is no way any human could survive being that stupid unless you have the genes of a kardashian or bieber i dont care how pretty he was      the jokes were not that funny in fact leaving the theatre i can honestly say i did not have one laugh out loud moment throughout the whole thing which will certainly be a surprise to most of my friends  the cameos were annoying  another bet must have been lost  i was sitting there thinking that bill murray has refused anything to do with ghostbusters for all these years that this was the part he decided to get involved in  some sort of a cross between a sceptic and a conspiracy theorist nerd  it was ridiculous  dan ackroyd as a taxi driver  it must have been a throwback to something because it just made no sense  sigourney weavers character was a little intriguing as was ernie hudsons blink and you would have missed harold ramis in the background      there was no reason for the evil guy to have been evil at least that was explained in the story  he just wanted to wreck some stuff up apparently  the finale just made no sense whatsoever and i could not understand how anyone is throwing themselves into the ghostly otherworld with just a rope to get pulled back hugging someone but its been done before in poltergeist including the white hair
Jul 30 2016,negative,funny movie but with no plot it made very difficult to follow i would wait to see this movie on dvd
Jul 30 2016,positive,highly enjoyable comedy
Jul 30 2016,positive,this move was under rated it surprised me because it was funny i actually enjoyed it
Jul 30 2016,positive,better than expected
Jul 30 2016,positive,the original ghostbusters defined my childhood between the cartoons the action figures and the movies  this new movie hit every single mark i could have dreamed of for a franchise relaunch and did it in a way that was respectful of the source material but without being overly beholden to it  the movie was funny and scary and packed full of action  definitely worth the e dx training few bucks to see it in 3d
Jul 30 2016,positive,go see it i would argue this stands up to the original the characters are much better balanced in this one they not only added great cameos but tastefully made fun of odd things women do while keeping us laughing  some excellent creepy scenes as well
Jul 30 2016,positive,nothing can beat the original but its the same formula and its fun and funny
Jul 30 2016,negative,saw the ghostbusters remake the other day the cast gave a great performance and the visual effects were basically like the originals with a more modern look    unfortunately the jokes were mostly really bad and the films villain didnt seem to have any reason for existing at all and eventually the movie just turned into an all female no animated dog version of scooby doo 2 with none of the charm the cameos by the original cast were nice though     basically it was a bad movie not awful or unwatchable just not good
Jul 30 2016,positive,i loved every minute of feigs ghostbusers the laughs start from the beginning of the opening scene and the writing just keeps up the pace throughout with everything from dry to goofy to subtle to completely overthetop jokes at several points the movie pokes fun at the kind of people who whined about female ghostbusters from the moment it was announced    the big bad in the movie is a hilariously portrayed social outcast stereotype the cameos were great  even harold ramis had a cameo as there was a bronze bust of him outside kristen wiigs characters columbia university office chris hemsworths turn as the dumb blonde secretary was superb i was relieved to see that leslie jones character was not as lowbrow as she appeared in the trailers she held her own in the team and in fact all four of the women were equal contributors each with their own clear strengths and they made a great team    another fun thing about it is that it was saturated with lady humor  gags aimed pointedly at a female audience im sure i even missed some of them because it seemed like every scene has some kind of subtle humor bit in it either a throwaway line or a prop or something in the scenery    the story was silly but plausible enough for suspension of disbelief although some of the technobabble kate mckinnon spewed was beyond ridiculous the bottom line though is that they clearly had fun making it and it shows definitely see it on a big screen if youre interested because the colorful effects and wide shots of manhattan are spectacular
Jul 30 2016,positive,this was such a fun funny and smart remake i only took away one star because i thought the cameos were distracting and not fun funny nor smart when they let these ladies just shine and be themselves it was magic or should i say supernatural kristin wiig and melissa mccarthy can do no wrong kate mckinnon has a lot of charisma but she should pull back on the caricature and be just the character leslie jones did what she could with yet another sidekick role for a black actor i wish they would have mixed things up and made her one of the scientists chris hemsworth was yummy and funny good job ladies
Jul 30 2016,positive,ghostbusters was legitimately hilarious the characters were likable i think the reviews are due to the original ghostbusters nostalgia which is understandable except they werent that good anyway theyre just classic and like many classics when you rewatch them they dont really stand the test of time
Jul 30 2016,negative,embarrassment to the busters franchise
Jul 29 2016,negative,its just a terrible movie poor story poor comedy badly executed shame because weve waited so long
Jul 29 2016,positive,good movie over all it saddens me that its underrated it deserves a little more praise
Jul 29 2016,negative,bad bad movie forced memes
Jul 29 2016,positive,great movie loved all the cameos
Jul 29 2016,positive,an impressive reboot  took the kids and they loved it
Jul 29 2016,positive,its not as great as the original but its no where near as terrible as a lot of people are making it out to be the cast works well together the writing isnt too bad the dialogue is pretty entertaining and most of the character writing is good there are nods and homages to the original film but it didnt feel as derivative as i was anticipating it would im a huge fan of the original films which ive loved since i was a child and was very hesitant about this one because a lot of the design didnt look great and the initial trailers kind of felt flat to me however i was definitely willing to give it a chance and im glad that i did im still not feeling the look of the new suits and have a couple other minor complaints but its overall a decent film as someone who has had franchises theyve loved get various degrees of disappointment in reboots and adaptations ie green hornet the last airbender dark shadows and the lone ranger and the wicker man it took me years to forgive nicholas cage for that last one and i dont know if ill ever forgive seth rogan for green hornet this was not as bad as it could have been its definitely worth watching at least once nothing personal against kristin wiig but i do think her character was the weakest of the principle cast the rest of the character writing was pretty well done
Jul 29 2016,positive,i think its a good sign that i started laughing pretty much immediately and i basically didnt stop until the first act of the movie ended the scriptwriting and casting were both fantastic and all four leading ladies did an excellent job the movie separates itself from the original with strong unique characters and a new plot but stays recognizable my only complaint is that the second act of the movie setting up the villain for the final conflict seemed to drag on for a bit but it was short enough before the action got started and everything was back to being a joy to watch
Jul 29 2016,positive,i dont honestly know what the trolls are complaining about re this movie the trailer didnt do it justice thats true but the movie itself is well worth whatever movie theaters are charging these days maybe even in 3d the only thing that stops this from being a 5star movie is a slightlyplodding 20minute portion in the middle where the bad guy with his lame evil reasoning does some i am an evil misunderstood bad guy exposition speech thats it     the rest of the movie is full of amazing comedic chemistry between mccarthy wiig mckinnon and jones the cameo appearances from almost all the living original ghostbusters cast will keep you guessing and laughing chris hemsworth in his eye candy role is adorably hilarious especially in the end credits scene and the stinger wow make a sequel ladies you will have my money guaranteed
Jul 29 2016,positive,as a woman who cares more about learning than romance i found the characters in this movie more relatable than the vast majority of characters in other movies this film proves that women dont need to be bland feminine caricatures who moan to their friends about how they cant get a date or damsels who need to be rescued in order to be great characters i dont understand why there is so much hate about this movie other than the guys who are upset that women are taking up the mantle  finally characters who i could see myself in
Jul 29 2016,negative,it was a bit entertaining  the cast was spot on  i dont believe the writers have even watched the original 2 films  would have been a lot better a sequel  like the new crew discovering all the old tech and notes from the original film or something like that
Jul 29 2016,negative,garbage make it based on the d6 games rules and it will be fantastic
Jul 29 2016,positive,aaaaaaaaaaamy friend and i had to resist screaming in joy the whole time we clung to one another though
Jul 29 2016,negative,this movie is not good  the jokes are lame the editing is poor  none of the characters do anything that makes sense   everything is done for a quick laugh but the only good scenes have all been played out in the endless trailers that we have all seen   the only thing that makes it worth seeing are the cameos from the original cast
Jul 29 2016,positive,im pretty sure folks are just really sexiest movie had me laughing just about the entire time hope they do come out with a part 2 great work
Jul 29 2016,negative,worst heap of garbage ive ever watched is leslie jones a dude
Jul 29 2016,positive,actually rally good   dont pay any attention to the whiny manchildren reviews
Jul 29 2016,positive,well i was proven wrong i admit i was not super excited about the reboot not because it was an all female cast but because the trailers led me to believe that the whole movie looked like a farce just another dumb comedy i was only partly right    if there is one thing that paul feig the director is good at its comedy ghostbusters is funny i mean laugh out loud funny some scenes almost made me cry thats how much i was laughing the whole cast is great but chris hemsworth steals every scene hes in he plays the teams incredibly dumb receptionist to perfection    the movie is a lot of fun beginning to end a great blockbuster for you to see in theatres but for me if i have to be honest i thought it lacked some of the seriousness of the originals too often this one felt like a slapstick comedy i would have wanted to fear the ghosts once in a while but that being said the cast did their thing and it works unfortunately the movie felt a bit too long and there is one scene at the end that i flat out hated it was simply too dumb way too out there for me youll know when you see it    i would have also preferred if they didnt try so hard to pay hommage to the originals so much yes it was cool to see some of the cast and ghosts we loved from the 80s movies but it was not necessary    in all worth the admission price and i would be down for a sequel i would also be interested in a spinoff maybe somewhere else than new york city with another set of characters for a lightly more serious movie
Jul 29 2016,positive,this was surprising how awesome this movie became the effects are awesome and the characters are entertaining although patty was portrayed to be the stereotypical african american female in the commercials i thought i was going to be annoyed by patty but yet found it entertaining to be offset by the other cast members oh and chris hemsworth is hillarious in this and has an even funnier part in the credits     the sound and music were entertaining and some of the redone original themes werent really too memorable    the narrative was a surprise specially with home little time was wasted explaining useless things the film was edited to the right length and didnt drag on    i would go watch this at the theaters to get that full experience plus the ladies are awesome as the leads
Jul 29 2016,positive,while it wasnt the original i have to say we enjoyed it enough to see it twice if you look at it as a new version of the franchise as a stand alone it was good
Jul 29 2016,positive,loved it  it actually felt like the movie was targeted at me and not the general cis white male audience  preordered it an hour after seeing it and encouraging all of the women in my life to go see it
Jul 29 2016,negative,low brow and unfunny
Jul 29 2016,negative,ugh what a waste of a night
Jul 29 2016,positive,this movie really was a fun ride the whole way through it has plenty of ghosts plenty of awesome new weapons many fun cameos and references to the old movies and plenty of personality i really want to see a sequel to this
Jul 29 2016,negative,every joke falls flat my friend begged me to leave 45 min into it no redeeming qualities here just awful ad lib crap that looks like they shot every scene with one take avoid this movie
Jul 29 2016,negative,couldnt get through 12 of it it really is that bad they get to the 1st ghost catching slimer scene at the 12 way point of te movie yeah thats how bad it is and that scene shooting proton backs over each other and then into a crowded room or when leslie jones fell flat right onto the proton pack and it didnt set off a nuclear explosion yeah no
Jul 29 2016,negative,i have no idea how anyone could like this move it was not funny in the least i mean zero laughs i dont even know how any of the actors could have read the script and think this is funny because nothing is funny in it even the original ghostbusters looking back at it now wasnt that funny either but it was so much better than this pile of crap if you go to this move believe me you will regret it luckily i didnt have to pay to see itit isnt worth even renting
Jul 29 2016,positive,i was a huge fan of the original ghostbusters film in fact i loved it so much i went through several garbage cans back in a small town in illinois collecting cans to recycle and buy my way back into the theater 7 total times to see the film one of my top 10 comedies of all time    while this one had me doubting it was remotely close to viewable going into the theater i left satisfied and looking forward to the next one melissa mccarthy is easily hollywoods hottest comedic actress paired with kristen wiig who can always hold her own it was a decent film along with some cool easter eggs and chris hemsworth who was hilarious i found this movie to be better than ghostbusters 2 believe it or not    cgi was solid and im ready to see morethere is no dana
Jul 29 2016,positive,i saw this movie with my 15 year old son  he and i had such a blast watching this together  i saw this movie with his daddy who passed away from cancer 5 years ago and we reminisced the old version with the new version  young and old can enjoy this movie while transcending through decades  i loves the fact the old and new cast interacted professionally and joyously  the memories shared watching this movie with my son will forever be forged in our memories  thank you on every level for creating this movie  again  and making it so funny and wacky like the original  i will see this again because it was that good
Jul 29 2016,positive,good not great well worth viewing
Jul 29 2016,negative,it was obvious the girls who are comedic geniuses were being told what to do and how to act to stick with the ghostbusters theme it was literally the first movie i ever walked out on
Jul 29 2016,negative,oh such a waste of a really funny cast with this director and cast this movie could have been really great in the end we just got another unnecessarily meh reboot
Jul 29 2016,neutral,not very good  wanted to actually walk out a few times  nothing to do with feminism  just poor worrying  writing that said  the theatre was full of children and they loved it  so maybe the right age for this movie is 7 or 8 to 15 years old
Jul 29 2016,positive,starts out funny and fresh but the special effects and the action movie vibe take over and drag it down let those actors joke their hearts out please
Jul 29 2016,negative,hardly a laugh in the entire film with such a talented group of actresses leading the way this truly is one of the alltime great missed opportunities
Jul 29 2016,positive,it was an amazing movie with extremely funny comedy  would love to see these ladies work together again
Jul 29 2016,negative,not a fan of remakes the proton packs to the junk felt excessively juvenile none of the jokes are memorable all around wasnt worth the ticket
Jul 29 2016,positive,way too longit was enjoyable but i wanted it to endand it just kept going
Jul 29 2016,negative,horrendous and offensive to the ghostbusters legacy a movie that is constantly fighting itself and its fan base mediocre stale boring and a soulless product packaged for people who never were interested in the prospect of a third ghostbusters film to begin with
Jul 29 2016,positive,loved it think the ending of the original was better but this was really good
Jul 29 2016,positive,i cant wait to see it again my kids faces were lit up like christmas while watching this film it has something for everyone the pacing just clips along so well that the movie actually feels short by comparison great characterization memorable and funny
Jul 29 2016,negative,where do i begin i gave up on this movie between half and three quarters of the way in the script is entirely devoid of humour there are numerous over attempts to make the movie comical which more than backfire they rip the very soul from the actors and actresses who are doing there very best with such shambolic material bill murray is one of my comedy heroes and he looks embarrassed and ashamed to be even present on set the effects are ok but the story is just so thin i am sure that children could have done better i was really hopeful that this would reignite my passion for the first two movies instead i feel somehow that my past has been tainted by a stain that i cannot wash from my memory  the movie deserves to bomb not for the talent on display but for the shocking summation that this movie was even worthy of the ghostbusters title whoever wrote this i bet they are really pleased with the result as the humour seems to be aimed at a very narrow audience but it just isnt funny
Jul 29 2016,positive,hilarious loved the comic timing
Jul 29 2016,positive,it was hilarious and showed women kicking ass a
Jul 29 2016,positive,though not for little kids i really enjoyed this movie funny and they have a new story line compared to the original with cameos by the original gb through the the movie i think it was quite a good movie
Jul 29 2016,negative,all the negative reviews are true
Jul 29 2016,positive,entertaining is why we go to the movies and ghostbusters was just that entertaining  nice cameos  
Jul 29 2016,negative,most god awful movie i ever saw avoid
Jul 29 2016,positive,great fun dont listen to the haters
Jul 29 2016,positive,loved everything about it  the casual feminist jibes  the cameos  the references to the original and the superlative visual effects
Jul 29 2016,positive,better than expected
Jul 29 2016,negative,just meh the comedy was not well written  the action was ok  its impossible not to compare to the original which was infinitely better written and genuinely funny without being slapstick
Jul 29 2016,negative,it was pretty terrible i hated it
Jul 29 2016,negative,very disappointed not funny nor entertaining
Jul 29 2016,negative,what a mess there are flickers of a good film here but much of the comedy falls flat and mckinnons who i normally love mugging grates ienormously its as though shes in another movie and in fact shes filmed that way were constantly shown shots of all the other actors together and then theres a cut to mckinnon reacting in a way that feels completely stagey
Jul 29 2016,positive,i thought they did a great job the movie was fun and it had a few nestalgic moments to keep you excited my daughter loved it and told me at the end of the movie she could not wait to get the dvd we thought the ghostbusters from a girls perspective was great  it was encouraging from the standpoint of intelligence and even had a way of making it really cool to be smart and pursue a degree in engineering  
Jul 29 2016,negative,was surprised to see sexism alive and well in 2016 this movie is very sexist toward men
Jul 29 2016,negative,waste of time and money
Jul 29 2016,negative,jokes were few the words they used were as stupid as they were spoken
Jul 29 2016,positive,laughed and laughed loved the cameos
Jul 29 2016,positive,fantastic and truly funny with very little discussion of the gender politics which clouded the pre production a worthy entry in the series and my favorite ghostbusters by far
Jul 29 2016,negative,at moments it was decent movie but the comedy was cheesy saturday night live comedy the move is not cannon with the originals and trys too hard to be like them
Jul 29 2016,negative,not funny enough too predictable if youve seen the original and best and trying too hard with the power woman stupid men thing
Jul 29 2016,positive,paul feig has managed to pay enough homage to the original yet giving the film his own personal touch of comedy
Jul 29 2016,negative,its not so good  i didnt care if it was a female cast or not  the movie is just boring senseless and poorly established characters dont help it  melissa mccarthys character contributes one thing to the film and it is barely ghostbusters  the diversity is more forced than ive seen in many films  there is no way leslie jones would spend one moment with these women unless she was paid  she had better work before this film and it clearly doesnt help her career  and chris hemsworth was painfully stupid  girls might think thats cute but even as a guy  i tried to seperate myself from all the rage and just watch ghostbusters  i should have skipped it completely  man its bad
Jul 29 2016,positive,amazingly refreshing and on its way to surpassing the original sorry butt hurt fan boys
Jul 29 2016,positive,loads of eye candy special effects but there  long spaces in the movie where the jokes go flat and the movie becomes boring does hold the fun pace of the original ghostbusters overall something is missing maybe the fun
Jul 29 2016,negative,most pathetic movie script
Jul 29 2016,positive,great movie so funny
Jul 29 2016,negative,this movie was almost horrible so much potential with an amazing cast but the reality was awful bad writing lame plot
Jul 29 2016,positive,if you are hesitant about seeing this movie because you loved the original and dont want to see it remade i can assure you that this movie stands on its own very well and was so much fun  just like the original i laughed out loud so many times and i really needed to have some good belly laughs this one was actually scarier than the first movie so i got some good adrenaline jumps too the actresses were hilarious the cameos by the original cast were terrific i especially loved looking at chris hemsworth he was so funny
Jul 29 2016,positive,this movie was great i honestly went in expecting it to be bad based on the reviews here but it was hilarious then i read the reviews and found that those people are idiots it was very funny and entertaining it was not the original movie not the same story not the same cast if you can get over that you will enjoy the movie
Jul 29 2016,positive,what a great reboot loved all the old cast popping in here and there cant wait to see what they do next
Jul 29 2016,positive,the design of the pke meter looked a bit goofy and the original ghostbusters could have been more utilised however i like the ways they paid homage to the original for example having egons head
Jul 29 2016,positive,enjoyable a good laugh but not to be taken as a serious film
Jul 29 2016,positive,very good and funny its not trying to replace the original just do something different and appeal to new people the graphics were awesome too worth a watch 
Jul 29 2016,neutral,well the nerds were half right 2016s ghostbusters reboot is a bald gendercentric cashgrab its got nothing on the original and hardly any characters are believable however at least some of the time its funny hemsworth is adorably stupid as kevin the male model turned receptionist who barely knows how to use a phone and patty isnt nearly as racially stereotyped as trailers lead us all to believe  shes the only buster whos just a person and not a badly written cartoon holzman is funny but also basically a psychotic muppet on drugs shes constantly making faces intentionally makes her inventions illogical illogically dangerous to its users pretty much all the original cast cameos were wasted as they were either badly written or just plain jerks yet some of the film is still fun    the 3d was creative and the newer backup weapons are badass but mostly this ones a miss
Jul 29 2016,positive,entertaining but im still a sucker for murray aykroyd ramis hudson and co doing their thing in the original
Jul 29 2016,positive,saw this last night laughed so did the rest of the sold out audience
Jul 29 2016,positive,great movie hilariously very entertaining throughout and with awesome effects
Jul 28 2016,positive,a magnificent romp down memory lane this movie hits on all points outstanding hilarious cast fantasticallydone special effects funny and apt script a showcase of diversity and a liberal use of ectoplasm
Jul 28 2016,positive,5 loved it 4 really liked it 3 liked it 2 didnt like it and 1 hated it
Jul 28 2016,positive,really really funny the action scene wasnt great
Jul 28 2016,positive,this was not worth all the drama if you are dead set on hating this movie then dont see it but if you go in with an open mind and not hold its predecessor in such high regards you might have a good time
Jul 28 2016,positive,i guess i would have liked it more if i was a huge og ghostbusters fan but not a big fan of mccarthy
Jul 28 2016,negative,crap save your money
Jul 28 2016,positive,though certainly not as memorable or funny as the original ghostbusters still provides enough laughs along with a unique origin story to justify its existence in the beloved franchise
Jul 28 2016,negative,very weak story and very superficial character development they relied too much on the original movie and simply didnt develop their story line
Jul 28 2016,positive,thought this was a fun one will be seeing it again kristen wiig and co crush it once again
Jul 28 2016,positive,i think they did a really good job
Jul 28 2016,negative,terrible movie no intelligence in this movie  the original was written and acted by geniuses this one is not even close
Jul 28 2016,positive,very good movie even though some bad rating from some big reviewers although admitidlly it had some dissapointments
Jul 28 2016,negative,not goodreally disappointed
Jul 28 2016,negative,such a bad job of writing and a terrible use of someone talented individuals like kristen wiig melissa mccarthy was obnoxious and was trying too hard which is usually the case and i dont even know who the other two women are but they were not funny at all still i blame the writers for weak material and below standard comedy
Jul 28 2016,positive,i was a little apprehensive of how they would portray patty from the trailers but her actual character in the movie was done very well
Jul 28 2016,negative,as the original movie was such a classic i was dubious as to whether it should be updated or rebooted i found the new version slow and trying to be too pc all female team male secretary etc trying to be humorous but often cringe worthy humor whilst also confused as to whether it should be close to the original story or tell a new one it felt mostly like the original movie but not told in such a humorous way and without the classic situations of the original towards the end i felt it really lost its way and became tedious not worth a view
Jul 28 2016,positive,the new ghostbusters movie is different badass and hysterical the script needed more editing and melissa mccarthy plays another two dimensional character but the backstory behind kristin wiigs character and everything kate mckinnon does make up for it the comedy is a bit drawn out as that is the existing dynamic between the four comediansso those who love their work on snl will find it familiar and have no issue but still funny plus everything that leslie jones says is perfection    if you are looking for a clone of ghostbusters with women you wont find it if you are looking for a fun and empowering movie featuring fight scenes with ghosts involving proton whips and one liners this is it     dialogue 710 for excessive conversations  fighting 1010 for proton whip  humor 910 because i hate fart jokes  length 810 for the irrelevance of wiigs entire tenure plotline  legacy 1010 for being a different film from the old ghostbusters series and for having perfect cameos of the old cast     overall 910  i think the sequel will be better i almost feel as though much of the writing for this film was stunted by writers afraid of the ghostbusters mob coming after them but their decision to change things up while still being true to what ghostbusters original is about gives them a good foundation since my major issue was with the writing and editing i have high hopes for future movies
Jul 28 2016,positive,this movie was good hush up all u h8trs
Jul 28 2016,positive,tried to watch the original ghostbusters a few days after seeing this and it only made me want to watch this version again wonderful acting and very funny
Jul 28 2016,negative,really boring movie
Jul 28 2016,positive,my husband and i went just because we were fans of of the original movies we wanted to go just for nostalgic purposes im one that does not like comedies very much because i find them crude and often vulgar can i just say that i was happily surprised this movie was thankfully not a continuation of the old storyline it is a reboot and i think that they didnt wonderful things with it i i laughed to the point that i cried within the first 20 minutes i was afraid that the only parts that were funny would have been in the trailer i was very wrong not only that but there is minimal cursing no pushing or overt sexuality and the only part i find annoying is where one of the characters repeatedly flipped people off thankfully he was only on screen for about 3 minutes compared to the originals i came home and rewatched immediately after getting back from the movies these are much cleaner and i honestly cant believe my parents let me watch them as a child my husband was worried about the ghostbusters being females he was eating his words by the end of the night and said they were hilarious i think our favorite parts however where are the cameos of the original cast members all in all a great movie and i would recommend it to children before i would the original ghostbuster movies
Jul 28 2016,positive,this was a fun movie dont let the haters ruin a perfectly good movie
Jul 28 2016,negative,the worst movie i have ever seen it ruined the legacy of ghostbusters
Jul 28 2016,positive,loved it melissa mccathrthy was amazingly funny in this im a big fan of paul feigs movies ghostbusters is one of the best
Jul 28 2016,negative,not good terrible acting awful story boring visuals
Jul 28 2016,neutral,this movie was a lot more funny then i thought it would be better yet it wasnt a sequel it was a reimagining and not just a remake there were some jokes however that fell dead on arrival and i could see someone finding the movie unfunny or not interesting also whoever was in charge of editing the trailers should be fired for what a bad job of showing what the movie is like so while yes the the first was better the second was good too and should not be written off as another bad remake
Jul 28 2016,neutral,its not a great remakebut its funny at timesspecially hemsworth  mckinnon were entertainingbut mccarthy  wiig were not funny at all
Jul 28 2016,positive,much better than anticipated love the cameos from the original cast and since it has been over 30 years since the original i feel the need to watch it again too
Jul 28 2016,negative,this movie sucked the big one  paul feig should not have never touched the ghostbusters franchise  the cast is great but the writing sucked the big one  feig really fumbled this  this ghostbusters remake was totally  pathetic
Jul 28 2016,negative,they ruined it  i just recently watched a movie that i feel well to be honest just read further the new ghostbusters movie is awful it should have never been made but since it has all copies should be burned at first i thought it was next in the series no then i thought it was them but as girls you know same old ghostbusters no if you have ever seen any of the original ghostbusters movies then this horrific display is nothing compared to it i was upset with how they portrayed the characters i cant even believe some of these people agreed to be in this movie it was like they tried to put all the old movies in this one but a little different they did a terrible job with this one i have heard people say they like this movie and that is fine but to me any real person who seen the ghostbusters would hate this joke of a movie as much as i do they should have kept the same characters rip egon and just made a third movie to the series the story line of how ghosts became was okay kind of cheesy and the ghosts themselves were good the new characters really ruin this movie and towards the end it was like they ran out of time or wanted to hurry up and finish it by having the ghostbuster symbol become the new giant state puff man and the tower becoming the portal like in the both the firstapartment building and the secondmuseum and in the first movie when dana and her neighbor louis become possessed by zuul and gozer but in the new one chris and melissa become possessed but by the same ghost rowan i think they even threw a little poltergeist in their with the rope and saving melissa from the ghost realm  my final thoughts if you want to see the ghostbusters movie    watch the original two not this one cause its not ghostbusters for this trying to be the same but a new form of its own   they just stole a lot of concepts of the old and other movies to do it
Jul 28 2016,negative,thank you for ruining another of my childhood movies
Jul 28 2016,positive,unfortunately this has become because of political correctness and its backlash almost impossible to rate objectively in the 2016 north american wish to either redo every successful film ever made and present every conceivable variant in the process for what could be deemed the lack of any possible originality of ideas i still tried to enter this with an open mind and see this as if the two films from the 80s which i enjoyed very much the one time i saw each of them had never existed i should state i saw this in 3d which i hardly ever do with my lady and our respective sons    i felt that it was quite funny and that the special effects were excellent next to avatar the use of 3d was the best i have ever seen its a popcorn flick wellworth seeing though i havent seen any other movies by feig or starring mccarthy it made me want to go back and give them a shot at some time in the near future there was something for everyoneboth my lady and i enjoyed it very muchand the boys three and thirteen yearsold respectively loved it as well give it a shot
Jul 28 2016,negative,why musted hollywood ruin everything  not horribly acted at least effects were terrible jokes wereally tired and flat 20 minutes another mccarthy snooze fest as can be expected from her movies at this point
Jul 28 2016,negative,the hype for this movie is undeserved a forgettable comedy with lackluster jokes less then stellar casting and a horrid homage that just isnt worth viewing
Jul 28 2016,positive,really funny and captures much of what the film industry reboots or lacking today
Jul 28 2016,positive,lots of fun for a remake  reboot as good as the original
Jul 28 2016,positive,went in not even thinking of the other ghostbusters and i had a really fun time great reactive audience too i love the casting and the easter eggs i thought it worked much better than i had originally anticipated
Jul 28 2016,positive,they did such a great job with this movie it definitely deserves a better rating
Jul 28 2016,positive,so why all the negative blowback on this version of ghoastbusters i cant explain it as the 2016 version while staying true to the original with homages to the old headquarters staying with the original logo despite coming up with some new logos and fun cameos by the original cast the all female ghoastbuster team attempts to blaze their own trail into this legacy and for the most part it really worked    ghoastbustersanswer the call was not only had a full cast of hilarity mainly the cast of snl but the allmighty thor got to let his hair down to play a lose funloving some would say dumb as rocks receptionist cleaver to have a male receptionist when the original had a female receptionistalthough jeanne had better phone skills the ladies couldnt get rid of kevin because not only was he the only applicant but as was pointed out they wont find another receptionist that beautiful another plus was the opportunity to see special effects and cgi that certainly wasnt available in 1984    so who you gonna call cause i aint fraid of this movie
Jul 28 2016,negative,horrible remake possibly entertaining to someone with a childs intellect
Jul 28 2016,positive,i laughed  a lot  probably more than i did when i first saw the original
Jul 28 2016,negative,bad too bad because i love the cast
Jul 28 2016,positive,good movie funny kids loved it
Jul 28 2016,positive,i cant believe the audience score of only 58  this movie was brilliantly scripted acted and produced only gender bias would explain this low score go see it
Jul 28 2016,positive,wouldve been better served if it was a true sequel instead of a reboot with almost the same exact characters as the originals gender swapped
Jul 28 2016,positive,loved it super funny thrilling scary and not a single ounce of misogyny now if only the manbabies could shut up and let this movie get its appreciation
Jul 28 2016,positive,ok as a 21st century reboot of the original but i think id rather watch the original  it feels like a bigger movie this one also sets up the inevitable sequel i dont understand all the hate this got though other than from those unreasonably upset that the male leads were replaced with female leads
Jul 28 2016,negative,terrible basicly its a crime to have made this and ruin the ghostbuster franchisenone of them seemed intelligent they just seemed like teenage girls with proton packs made of left over garbage going on a ghost hunt and they killed bill murray the original ghost buster it was terrible do not waste your money on this film some funny parts but it was just slapstick comedy that would make a 2yo laugh
Jul 28 2016,negative,the plot seemed like it was lacking the humor pitiful and cameos just degrading to the original actors  i did not see any humor in taking a great movie and making it a feminist movement with sexism  come on most of the men in the movie were portrayed as dumb and halfwitted  when i think of the original i dont think that women were put down  no human on earth would cover their eyes to protect themselves from noise  ruined a good thing  maybe the female audience will find humor in this but i doubt it
Jul 28 2016,neutral,this film felt labored and the comedy felt forced i wanted to like it i tried not to compare it to the original it didnt help that they kept including cameos and references to it i admire them for trying to do something different than before but it just didnt work
Jul 28 2016,positive,loved it with my sons
Jul 28 2016,negative,very disappointingsadly just wait for dvd i couldnt believe how not funny wiig and mccarthy were in this movie but loved the cameo appearances
Jul 28 2016,positive,movie was good and entertaining
Jul 28 2016,negative,far too much pink for my liking
Jul 28 2016,positive,its funny bit more mature content rather than the original but nothing news is what lack of this movie    despite its claim all woman protagonist but i enjoy the jokes not the story
Jul 28 2016,negative,all the talent with no substance to back it up boring and unevenly paced with only a couple funny moments and a strange fetish for special effects it also doesnt help that the end battle feels like it was ripped right out of call of duty not even the original cast could save this film
Jul 28 2016,negative,the only portion i enjoyed was with the original cast appeared on screen not one laugh  i was really disappointed
Jul 28 2016,positive,much like the original film as a horroradventure ghostbusters isnt particularly thrilling but as an ensemble comedy it boasts a great cast with a fun vibe and a completely unhinged performance by kate mckinnon that is absolutely worth a look
Jul 28 2016,negative,melissa mccarthy and leslie jones gave good performances despite how poorly written their characters were the jokes were bad the camera angles were lame the score was terrible the villain seemed to be picked straight out of an episode of scooby doo the content of his character and quality of his acting were both complete fails the vfx were ok but couldve been a lot better overall if this had been a pilot episode of a live action scooby doo series on the cw i wouldve given it five stars if not for all the controversy i wouldnt have noticed that every single male in this movie was a bully or an idiot if not for lowered expectations i dont see how anyone could consider this fresh
Jul 28 2016,negative,the first joke of the movie was about queefing and it was all down hill from there
Jul 28 2016,negative,yawn  decent special effects  no new story and not really funny  the new crew does not live up to expectations
Jul 28 2016,negative,worst film seen in 10 years this film is sexist very antimen and clearly offensive you have a dumb blond male secretary and regressive sassy black woman ghostbuster who worked in a menial job at the start only one of the women who is not a scientist and to kill the villain they shoot it in the groin what a farce of a movie
Jul 28 2016,positive,such a fun movie  i havent laughed out loud so much in a long time cameos and hidden easter eggs were great mckinnon has now established herself as a standout actor one of my favorites i liked the original gb and i think this one holds its own
Jul 28 2016,positive,great film the trailers truly did not do it justice im so glad that i took a chance anyway and went to see it
Jul 28 2016,negative,this movie was one of the worst reboots to date and thats saying something the jokes were lame the plot was non existent and the special effects were cartoonish and the movie was actually boring
Jul 28 2016,positive,this movie was quite entertaining at first the pacing slogged and the jokes were more goofy than smart but towards the last half the script became tighter there was a lot more fun ghostbusting than the previous films although its a remake there were so many easter eggs from the cartoons that it felt like a live action remake of the series than the original movie especially with the live action homage to the animated ghostbusters intro the new characters had a nice balance of familiarity and originality i also thought each of the cameos were smart and hit their marks
Jul 28 2016,negative,saw this with my family  chris hemsworth is the funniest thing in this movie   he had some great jokes but ends up being a dumbass   the female leads try to be funny but it just turns into a shitshow  honestly feig needs to stick to his own style and steer far from anything dealing with remakes   i liked spy thought it was funny   this was a trainwreck due to a plane crash   they try to make this all about the girls but they seriously had no chemistry   the jokes were forced and hell hemsworth while funny scenes was useless   at least in the originals janine the secretary had a great sense of humor and a snarky attitude   if you have any love for the original stay away from this piece of crap   i liked gb 2 more than this movie
Jul 28 2016,positive,an impressive homage to its predecessor of 1984s ghostbusters and still does a good job standing on its own as the future franchise of sony
Jul 28 2016,positive,actually a 45 but im giving it extra loving because people should go see it
Jul 28 2016,negative,i finally got around to watching ghostbusters last night and what a waste of two hours it was i think i must have watched a different movie to others as this was in no way funny or entertaining    within the first 15 minutes of the film there is a fart joke a poo joke and a yo mama joke this set out the level of humour you can expect from this movie    i do have fond memories of the original movie but if this was a film of any other name it would still be terrible all of the jokes fell flat the pacing was off and there were so many plot holes and continuity errors its laughable about the only funny thing about this movie i have a feeling that this was only called ghostbusters due to name recognition if it were anything else people would have overlooked this film and not bothered with it    i cant recommend this movie to anyone it would be better if it was forgotten about
Jul 27 2016,negative,forced this whole movie is forced cant we just have movies that are fun
Jul 27 2016,neutral,wellit was what i expected nothing more and nothing less  the acting was hard to stomach at times and the comedy was too lose or too heavy with little in between  great comedians but bad rolesor maybe just a bad script  i was not feeling well though maybe it ws a better movie but my stomach virus made it less enjoyingor maybe the movie made my illness worsehmmm ill have to give it another shot in the future to find outonce it is netflix for free
Jul 27 2016,positive,very funny and entertaining  it has a few moments were the writing is a bit weak and i think they needed better direction when it came to action scenes  but over all this is a solid movie  kate mckinnon steals the show
Jul 27 2016,positive,its ok but original is better
Jul 27 2016,negative,flaccid and unfunny remake
Jul 27 2016,negative,was not very funny and copied the original too much be creative but true to the themes in the original franchise also portrayed men in a very sexist way
Jul 27 2016,positive,oh my gosh loved it
Jul 27 2016,positive,much better than the original
Jul 27 2016,negative,pretty mindless cgi bonanza a scooby doo live action movie minus the fun
Jul 27 2016,positive,great film only a few issues with the cringe and the spraypaint but its a really funny film and is amazing and worth a watch on the big screen
Jul 27 2016,negative,    check out the funny review up top but basically this movie has no reason for being unnecessary really only a few laughs but otherwise cartoonish action and boring unfunny execution
Jul 27 2016,neutral,i thought i would love it i didnt the jokes were stupid chris hemsworth im a hot dumb dumb jokes were wannabezoolander and borderline sexist how much could you play up a hot guys body he literally was in this show for his face its like they tried soooo hard to make this film empowering that it turned into a sad tryhard feminist film i laughed at maybe10 of it yurch come on kristen wiig and melissa mccarthy i expected better
Jul 27 2016,negative,one more movie franchise that has been rebooted straight from hell this was the worst reboot i have ever seen and ive seen some bad reboots forced comedy that is trying way to hard to be funny the villain was atrocious chris hemsworth played a moron but not a loveable or tolerable moron a moron you wanted to punch repeatedly in the face i like kristin wigg and melissa mccarthy but they were horrible in this film the other two snl chicks sucked super cgi festlike over blown to the tenth power the story was clearly written by idiots i cant believe bill murray dan ackroyd and ernie hudson even agreed to make horrible cameosjust sad well there goes another childhood favorite film destroyed by hollywood for the sake of making a buck dont waste your time with this piece of trash
Jul 27 2016,positive,ghostbusters was phenomenal not only was the cast perfect but the film did an excellent job of balancing the weight of the original while bringing in new material for new audiences
Jul 27 2016,negative,the first 15 minutes is completely unwatchable a movie should not be unwatchable
Jul 27 2016,positive,loved it have seen it five times thanks to my moms theater job
Jul 27 2016,negative,went for the yuck yucks  left with just a yuck
Jul 27 2016,positive,i loved this it was oodles of fun dont know why all the babies are still crying about it
Jul 27 2016,positive,the funniest thing ive seen all year  it was refreshing to see all the typical sexist tropes turned on their heads dumb pretty secretary one gender representing science the theater was in a fit of laughter for just about the entire movie there was a joke in there for everyone  go see this film
Jul 27 2016,positive,funny funny movie its wonderful to see ghostbusters making a comeback in the franchise im excited that a new generation gets to experience the paranormal in a comedic way ive already seen the movie multiple times
Jul 27 2016,positive,i expected it to be a one star film based on the trailers but the film was actually better than i expected some parts were corny some dull but it tied in well it still doesnt touch the orignials
Jul 27 2016,negative,worst reboot ever take arthur robocop and total recall and it worse then them put together
Jul 27 2016,positive,i fell in love with this movie the first time i saw it and watched it 3 times in a row 100
Jul 27 2016,positive,i made a rotten tomaoes account just to give this movie five stars this is the first movie ive seen with women in science who took themselves seriously but could still be funny i grew up around references to the old ghostbusters which is a wonderful movie but i can honestly say that this one outpaces it in humor and comradeship
Jul 27 2016,positive,dan akroyd as executive producer and guest appearances from the past make this film theee film to see this summer very well written so many gags and kate just stands out as bills prodigy 80s film in 2016 mad get up an go see it
Jul 27 2016,positive,i walked out of ghostbusters fully confident of the arating i was going to give it i had my arguments all prepared of why this and that critic was wrong thank god i let my thoughts stew for a couple of days while ghostbusters is still a good film it falls just shy of the theatre worthy category and right smack dab into the folding clothes movie category    physics professor erin gilbert kristen wiig is trying to get her tenure at columbia university when a book on ghosts and the paranormal she wrote with her friend abby yates melissa mccarthy suddenly resurfaces on amazon and threatens her credibility erin seeks out abby to get her to take the book down in a pretty direct movement of events an encounter with a ghost ends up teaming the ladies up with two other ladies to become the ghostbusters    overall i think the movie suffered from just plain trying too hard at times the funniest jokes in film as in real life are usually the ones that occur naturally and a lot of the humor here was forced unfortunately its hard justifying a high score for a movie when the funniest characters are the ones without primary roles there are quite a few corny moments where the jokes fall extremely flat but side characters like bennie the delivery guy karan soni keep the movie from falling too deep into the muck    for all of its wrongdoings ghostbusters does a great job of paying homage to the original movies while trying to establish a sense of originality there are quite a few cameos none of which i will ruin that will squeeze a couple of chuckles out of fans of the older movies on the newer side of things i appreciated some of the interesting gadgets that were introduced scientist jillian holtzmann kate mckinnon shows us that theres clearly more than one way to catch a ghost getting to see those gadgets in action turned out to be pretty cool to watch it also gave us a chance to see more of the weird quirky jillian who was the funniest of the ghostbusters by a landslide without her and chris hemsworth who played kevin the awful receptionist this movie would have been a true trainwreck    im rooting for this series to succeed and i hope they find out a way to make the second film funnier its probably going to start with improving the lines of leslie jones almost all of her jokes were a miss and it made her stick out like a sore thumb it was cringeworthy at times    liked it didnt love it rent it save yourself a trip and some money i give it a 73
Jul 27 2016,positive,i have to admit i went in as a hater but from the very first scene this movie entertained me better than any other this summer  scary well written and overall a great flick
Jul 27 2016,positive,im pretty sure that more than half of these audience reviews are from people who havent actually seen the movie its a quality reboot which obviously had the originals blessing with many laughs throughout it manages to feel both new and familiar and i highly recommend it
Jul 27 2016,negative,this film suffers from a severe identity crisis it tries too hard to appeal to everyone and in the process appeals to no one  i would only recommend ghostbusters 2016 to someone wanting to entertain small children with bright flashing colors all of the characters are flat one liner stereotypes all the jokes relay on pointing and laughing at how dumb someone is or something dumb someone said the plot makes no sense and is extremely basic it is hard to be invested in the film when there are no  consequence to any of the characters actions for example the ghostbusters murder a man and the cops do nothing the product placement is over the top throughout the film as well perhaps the most annoying aspect for me is that the ghostbusters spend a large portion of the film developing there special weapons which is the reason why they have to fight the ghosts instead of anyone else only to stab the stay puff  marshmallow man with a swiss army knife to kill him they throw away everything for a cheap laugh final thought how do you kill a ghost there was a reason the original ghostbusters in the 80s would trap the ghosts not kill them
Jul 27 2016,positive,this was hilarious a great cast and awesome battle scenes made this a great film that can stand fine on its own definitely worth a watch
Jul 27 2016,negative,describing this movie as ridiculously bad would probably be too nice as the ridiculouspart could imply that its actually funny
Jul 27 2016,negative,not great a few humorous parts
Jul 27 2016,negative,wasnt what i thought i was going to seevery boringactors trying very hard to be funnyok ending
Jul 27 2016,positive,in my opinin the reboot was cool but i just give 4 stars because i didnt like so much rowan in the fact that the producers of the movie didnt explained why he wanted revenge at all and the was a little short time i mean i would like to much more uif it was like 2 hours complete the evil of rowan actually was credible very credible and i love the cgi but i really wanted know what happened to him to make him be so bad as he was and alos why the ghosts did what he ordered to do i know in the book it says the he wrote i will lead them but why he but in all the rest i love it special the part when erin says to abby that she wont leave her alone again i snap myself across the room was so cool alos i dont know why theeir hair turned to white
Jul 27 2016,negative,i had lowered my expectations so much that i was hoping the film might be somewhat enjoyable that was not the case the bad reviews say much that i would agree with so ill just add a few things whoever wrote this is not funny the jokes are awful they shouldnt have made a saturday night live cast movie with melissa mccarthy and chris hemworths character  no one is that stupid    but i think the worst thing about the ghostbusters reboot was all of the ugliness the reaction and general disappointment in the trailer was ugly the sexist and racist backlash was horrible and what leslie jones went through on twitter last week was the worst fucking thing ever shes an ok comedian but probably a really good person and she definitely didnt deserve any of that    everything about this was ugly i hope to god there is no sequel and i hope everyone stops talking about this movie soon that would be nice
Jul 27 2016,negative,im sorry but this movie was a slapstick comed  the exact opposite of what i think needs to be a dark humor with minor slapstick introduced throughout no dick jokes no pussy jokes and certainly no fartqueef jokes would of gone a lot farther in getting a better review from me i mean there are ways to intelligently monocure a genital joke but its the subtle that would make it funny not in your face front butt gas jokes if you do that go for the southpark approach the ghosts were a bit mystical looking in this the heavy blue influence and orange was color palette pandering to the nth degree that michael bay uses in transformers why not get a hotter orange and throw in the more green effects it still color pallets well and would feel more original also i felt there were sexist undertones in this movie the women werent allowed to be fluid because of this they had no real struggle within society yet banged out every male as a bad guy why were the males even bad guys ronan should have been a female to be honest the characterization of her would have been more fleshed i think if he were a female because of the sexist tone this movie took he essentially was bad because i think if ronan was female and she controls the kevin character it would have had a more menacing feel as well as she could of had the poise that kevin showed the bad guy to have which poise i didnt get from the actual ronan i just think this whole movie was trying to hard to show women can do what men can do better showing better action then ive seen in a lot of action movies of late this wasnt an action movie though it should have saved the epic action for the end not mid end ronan battle is silly and how does that ghost portal work why dont the ghost busters have that why would they not put it in a vault why is everything that happens erased when the final confrontation is over thats not fair there is no repercussions for the characters no reason for another movie in this series to have any societal struggles for the main characters in acted still they should have cost the city millions they should be caught up in red tape they need something for their characters to grow as of now its only emotional friendship growth which is nice but it doesnt show that they live in any justification of a real world they live in a power fantasy for female warriors but lets face it even zena had society to contend with everywhere she went what a bad ass she was unlike these ghost warriors having to contend with being constantly seen as less then anything and still doing whats right where as these girls have no repercussions for any actions the mayor covers for them with shadow government tactics
Jul 27 2016,positive,great fun and enjoyable to watch  wish there could have been more from the old cast though hopefully they will have a reunion at some point  perhaps in a sequel
Jul 27 2016,positive,nice movie not perfect but actually it is funny
Jul 27 2016,positive,i had really high hopes and i was not disappointed it was really awesome and had nice hints to the old ghostbusters movies
Jul 27 2016,negative,where do i even begin well here first off why was this film made sony flat out had a franchise that hasnt been touched in forever but has a solid fanbase and turned it into a product placement filled feminist agenda film and before all of you start commenting about how im just a whiny misogynst who doesnt like women in his movies here me out i can name plenty of science fiction movies with female leads that are great movies and there are great comedies with female leads but when the all female team becomes a gimmick and all the men in your film are shown as egotistical dicks or just plain stupid it becomes really lazy that really comes out in the jokes i may have laughed at two jokes in the whole film and i cant even remember what they are kate mckinnnon was so annoying melissa mccarthy and kristen wiig looked like two actresses who were just told be funny and lack any kind direction or motivation leslie jones was the only one who seemed to be invested or even seem like a human being in this movie shes the only one who was afraid when she saw a ghost chris hemsworth plays the extremely dumb receptionist who at first gets a laugh but when the joke of him being dumb gets dragged out way too long you can just tell its another shot at the antimen angle the only other thing i can think of that was kind of interesting were the designs of the ghosts and the gadgets the actual ghostbusting was pretty cool even though the original wasnt exactly an action movie i wasnt opposed to the action movie ending but bottom line this movie just isnt funny if i was watching this at home i would have turned it off stick with the original folks
Jul 27 2016,negative,well girls managed to cheer fans shouldnt have to worry about it but unfortunately almost everything else was disgusting in this movie thank you very much paul
Jul 27 2016,positive,loved it it is a showcase of special effects the timeline is a little chopped and sequence is kind of brokenrushed the kind of comedy i could take my little daughters with me no sexual appealing and no bad language
Jul 27 2016,positive,loved it had an amazing time watching it
Jul 27 2016,positive,honestly it was enjoyable  as someone who is old enough to remember seeing the originals it holds its own  i think nostalgia really messes with peoples memory    i do recommend seeing it in 3d
Jul 27 2016,positive,i thought this movie was funny and did a good job to stand alone from the other ghostbusters with all the new gadgets and special features its just not as real as the first
Jul 27 2016,positive,probably the best movie ive seen all year
Jul 27 2016,positive,anyone giving this movie bad reviews probably have a real problem the women playing these roles but in honesty they are better  this new version is much more quirky than the original they could have done something cooler with the staypuft man but really thats my only critique  my whole family loved it  cant wait for zule in the sequel
Jul 27 2016,positive,it was ok it was different  im so glad i got to see most of the original characters 
Jul 27 2016,negative,this movie so bad 110
Jul 27 2016,negative,for a reboot rather than sequel it spends a lot of time winking and nudging to the original in a quite annoying way they should have made it a sequel and hand the reigns over properly to a new cast rather than do this awkward botch job the characters were terrible and the cast seemed bored by their own performances with the exception of mckinnon who was brilliant hemsworth was embarrassing and you cant believe he thought what he was doing was funny the comedy was confused sometimes for 5yearolds sometimes more adult so not as together as bridesmaids or spy messy soulless cheap and pointless i really hope this doesnt start a new franchise this could have been good but didnt click its a good cast good director and the idea was there but this was clearly the wrong directorwriter and wrong approach shame move along
Jul 27 2016,negative,poor caricatured characters lame villain a failure to garner any emotional connection to the characters and annoying special effects
Jul 27 2016,positive,cant compare it to the original if you can go in with an open mind its a fun and funny movie
Jul 27 2016,positive,this movie was hilarious and good i dont know why everyone has a problem with the girl cast because they were super funny
Jul 27 2016,negative,a comedy movie is meant to make the audience laugh a horror movie is meant to make the audience scared a horrorcomedy is meant to make one laugh and add a sense fear while laughing at it this movie fails to do anything but make one wish it was over the special effects seems like they were made for a video game this movie also felt like a vehicle for antimale sentiments every male character in the movie is either a coward moron or a jerk
Jul 27 2016,negative,i went in no expecting much or to compare it to the other ghostbusters movies but alone this was a bad film funny one lines but not enough to carry it through they were able to have appearances by almost all of the cast members from the other films so why is it that they just current make movie with them
Jul 27 2016,positive,there are plenty of lol moments in the movie  all of the women are funny  special shout out to leslie jones for her great work  great popcorn flick
Jul 27 2016,positive,i laughed a lot and thoroughly enjoyed this movie
Jul 27 2016,positive,if you claim to be a ghostbusters fan and utterly hate this remake you are not a true fan why because you have failed to see this is more than just a remake it is a tribute while ghostbusters 2016 does not beat the cleverness storytelling or uniqueness of the first film the new ghostbusters shines a light on four amazing women that deliver their best performances with what they have been given    it is needless to say there is an amazing chemistry between melissa mccarthy kristen wiig kate mckinnon and leslie jones however it is inevitable to feel weary halfway throughout the movie when leslie jones and kristen wiig are still performing the same exact character we have seen so many times they are doing what they know how to do best but we have seen it so many times that it is just not interest anymore on the other hand  melissa mccarthy and kate mckinnon specially mckinnon steal the movie and make it more enjoyable than the actual story should be    the performances however do not get to flourish for long halfway through the movie a villain without a true purpose appears and the story gets lost the great introduction to our four heroines is soon forgotten and there is little to enjoy with the exception of some well controlled special effects the screenplay is just not good and the character development feels incomplete    there is no way fans will fall in love with this film but if you are a true ghostbusters fan you will notice and enjoy all the references from the first movie the witty appearances from the previous cast and the refreshing performances of these four women this movie is nothing more than a wellthought out tribute very badly executed it lacks the originals charm wit and comedygenius
Jul 27 2016,negative,now that the new ghostbusters movie has been out for a few weeks can we now agree that positive feminine role models aside it is an inherently awful movie
Jul 27 2016,positive,reading through the reviews im absolutely uphauld by how negative and nasty the comments are at the very least the movie was entertaining melissa did play a tamed character which i enjoyed because it shows her range the female cast had just the right amount of chemistry and each exhibited their own style of humor   i loved this movie it was refreshing and goofy a good pause from the real world it was nice to just laugh and enjoy
Jul 27 2016,neutral,255  ghostbusters is watchable good time if youre drunk stereotype characters with some cliche joke i had a few laugh
Jul 27 2016,positive,its good not great not terrible just good for all the controversy around this film i was hoping it would swing either way as is it is a decent lets just throw it on film vilian is the worst part as he is so forgettablethe main 4 are brilliant though play off one another brilliantly and for me with a tight script they will do magic so in short not a patch on the original but that was never going to happen but a very solid grounding for the obvious to come franchise
Jul 27 2016,positive,i dont know why this movie has gotten so much hate well i think i do but im not going to go there here despite some comments indicating otherwise this movie is really funny the entire theater was laughing throughout leslie jones kate mckinnon and chris hemsworth were hilarious melissa mccarthy was funny and kristin wiig was   perfect as the straight man  or in this case woman the cameos and call backs to the original were fun but the story was original its not quite 5 star material but i enjoyed this film thoroughly
Jul 27 2016,negative,another cash cow of a remake tasteless toilet humour and wasted talents
Jul 27 2016,positive,this collaboration of references visual humor and a team that fits together like it was meant to be is far more enjoyable than the barrage of sex jokes and sexual references of the original
Jul 27 2016,positive,i didnt just like this move because the manbabies hated it but frankly  it was just funny fun funny i laughed a lot
Jul 27 2016,positive,much better than expected i almost didnt go due to the awful previews
Jul 27 2016,positive,this movie is great wasnt expecting the jump scares it was hilarious though people only hate on this movie for one reason and everybody knows why yall need to stfu
Jul 27 2016,negative,i wanted to like this movie  i really did  its just so unfocussed  it doesnt know what it wants to be  it doesnt know how much its acknowledging the original  it doesnt know in what ways its characters are supposed to be funny  it just collides around and then collapses to an end    there were moments i genuinely laughed out loud but that was mainly fueled by me rooting for it so much that when it occasionally hit the mark i was so pent up from being disappointed while still rooting for it that i overcompensated    such a waste
Jul 27 2016,positive,so amazingly funny  worth seeing more than once
Jul 27 2016,negative,a bunch of funny comedians trying their best to compensate for a rushed script i laughed quite a few times but that jokes that dont work bomb hard and it was hard to get invested at all with such a terrible villain that all being said kate mckinnon and leslie jones are treasures worth a rental if youre curious but avoid at all cost if you love ghostbusters as much as i almost walked out towards the end
Jul 27 2016,positive,while it doesnt hold a candle to the original it can certainly stand on its own great ensemble work and big laughs make this a thoroughly entertaining ride
Jul 27 2016,negative,this wasnt okay a lot of the jokes flopped so badly i felt myself getting embarrassed just for hearing them i never really laughed the special effects felt wrong i believe a lot of puppets were used in the original and the endingthe grandiose final blowwas a horrible gag and horribly anticlimactic    a lot of the drama leading up to this film really hit the nail on the head it just felt wrong like it didnt care it was a reboot and that there was already an established audience most of the characters were token females and a token africanamerican lady to boot and just didnt seem to grasp anything great out of the first series to base this one off of it felt like it was too consumed with being antinerd which is apparently equivalent to antisexist even though there are plenty of lady nerds out there like me progressive second or third wave feminist and new not taking anything much but the ip from the originals that it missed the point entirely    best skip this one go watch the original againit holds up better than this
Jul 27 2016,positive,not awesome but good for nostalgia
Jul 27 2016,positive,it was okay  im not really a mccarthy fan as i feel she is much over rated and they could have picked anyone for her role as it wasnt especially comedic really the same goes for wig her talents are completely wasted any humor is almost exclusively carried by and carried well the rest of the squad im not sure it was necessary to reinvent the gbs from the ground up either the movie moved a consistent pace that while not rapid was enough to maintain interest although next time i watch it ill make sure i have laundry to fold
Jul 27 2016,positive,seen this twice now with my wife and both times we were laughing all the way through as was the audience im really puzzled by the organised hate this film is getting we found the characters to be fun the ghost effects to be surprisingly beautiful loved the colour design and it had a really inventive and effective use of 3d very clever we loved it certainly no worse than other action films or comedies that seem to  get complete passes from the same people hating on this
Jul 27 2016,negative,not even half a star
Jul 27 2016,negative,should not be a pg
Jul 27 2016,negative,absolutely pss poor an embarrassment to the original
Jul 27 2016,positive,a brilliant fun and hilarious reboot of the original ghostbusters portrayed by incredibly talented actors a definite must see
Jul 27 2016,negative,not all what i was expecting it wasnt funny kinda put me to sleep
Jul 27 2016,negative,for me this abomination fails on all fronts it lacks the charm and humor of the original  not recommended
Jul 27 2016,positive,this movie is great trailers didnt do it justice but i was laughing out loud almost from the word go
Jul 26 2016,positive,i really enjoyed this reboot it has a lot of its own flair and a unique story acting was top notch excellent family fare
Jul 26 2016,positive,it was a very cool movie and made me and the family laugh and made them jump
Jul 26 2016,positive,this was an awesome reboot  the nods to the original gb movies the playful twists the cameos the all girl crewfantastic
Jul 26 2016,positive,enjoyed it the buildup to the final showdown maybe dragged a bit but as a whole it was good fun
Jul 26 2016,negative,this film is crap it wouldve been so much better if they had all guys in it this is a guy film not a stupid chick flick
Jul 26 2016,positive,holtzman is the best
Jul 26 2016,negative,had high hopes such a great cast who were funny individually but the movie was just badly made thrown together almost moved quickly and lacked over all polish and quality sad but whatever
Jul 26 2016,negative,tired unfunny and a sad shadow of the originals this corruption of the source material was a confused mess of political agenda and bad writing i laughed maybe three times and found one scene watchable the rest of the film was predictable and i could have happily walked out and not felt like i missed anything definitely a skip
Jul 26 2016,positive,absolutely loved this movie i am a fan of the original and enjoyed every joke
Jul 26 2016,positive,this movie was fantastic  it was funny without having to be too raunchy or typical girl funny  chris hemsworth was the best dumb blonde ive ever seen  the commercials dont do it justice    besides the great jokes and well done special effects its a great girl power movie  and its not a preachy even though were girls we can do this kind of movie  they just saved the day  they were scientists who believed who had the smarts and the tools and they also just happen to be girls when my daughter is old enough to deal with the spooky parts ill definitely let her watch it because its important that she knows she can be anything she wants to be even a ghostbuster
Jul 26 2016,negative,boring but filmed in australia so that explains a lot  oh well worth renting for all of the easter eggs
Jul 26 2016,positive,i went in open minded with my children i watched them fall in love with ghostbusters the way i did as a 5 year old the movie made a beautiful new take on a tale ill never grow to old to watch
Jul 26 2016,positive,i found ghostbusters to be very nostalgic funny and just the right amount of change to keep me interested i really loved it  my teens loved it too
Jul 26 2016,negative,stop trying to force shitty movies on america
Jul 26 2016,positive,really funny movie most kids and adults will like its a great remake of ghostbusters even though its not pretty true to the original
Jul 26 2016,positive,this new ghostbusters was such a fun movie it is its own new story with great characters
Jul 26 2016,positive,while i cant speak for everyone else i personally enjoyed this movie it was fun experience for me the action is good and the four leading ladies really make this movie enjoyable and director paul feig does a great job but for every great aspect of this film there is always it is  is it better than the original hell no not by a long shot but on its own it is a solid view and i give moderately high recommendation
Jul 26 2016,negative,everything was too forced
Jul 26 2016,negative,disclaimer i did not pay to see this terrible movie so i watched it online for free in the most suitably worst quality    ghostbusters 2016 is sony and paul fuck you feigs reboot to draw in the mostly stupid crowds they think will give them a new bankable franchise only 88 million out of 144 million people were fooled enough to see it if this was the presidential race id probably have high hopes for america than i ever did before    the first trailer that came out for this piece of forgettable garbage started a huge argument on the internet about the retarded ignorant shitthrowing sexistmisogynist cultists versus the feminists who thought this movie will be the gateway to more female presents in one of the most culturallycelebrated artistic mediums of film versus the ghostbusters fans that were sane enough to express reasonable disagreements about how paul totalfuckingprick feig was being thoughtless and not respecting the original source material    how did sony and paul cockface feig react to this paul feig called all the ghostbusters fans assholes and saying fuck you to them all on his twitter even the ones who were being respectful paul feig was acting like the overgrown manchild he seems to have hated and when he and sony came out and said if people dont come to pay to see our movie then theyre all womenhating donald trump worshiping rapistswhich made me want to never pay to see the movie which i didnt    the ghostbusters movie is an origin story of how the whole team of hilarious women caricatures of the original cast come together building ghost traps kind of who dont want to make a business out of catching ghosts but to just hunt and study ghosts while working with the government while theres a subplot with a nerdy ghostbusters fan who wants to open portals to other ghost dimensions because he was bullied and picked on and paul feig just really hated his core audience    it seems like once the backlash on the first trailer came about there seemed to have been a specific and possibly interesting vision i wanted to give a chance and see if i could like it i really tried to give this movie a chance but it had no interest in having a consistent or effective vision other than it being an almost 2 hour long hate rant on the ghostbusters fanbase    paul feig really wanted to show how much he wanted to hate on all the people who were disagreeing with the direction the franchise or reboot was going and he wanted to exploit the shit out of the antifeminist stupid guys by which is what surrounds these female characters who are given nothing to work with and only doing improve that comes off truly and cringeworthily awful that completely ruins and destroys the talent these four female leads are much more better at than anything this movie or its director could ever have hoped to provide    the visual effects are ungodly awful some scenes did some interesting bits like with mannequins moving around and slimer and some great 2d animation with the ghostbusters logo coming to life but the rest of the ghost effects are something youve seen out of eddie murphys haunted house which is even more terrible when the effects for ghostbusters 2016 look even worse like green lantern worse and the score is fucking depressingly dreadful making failed attempts at making the ghostbusters theme out of an orchestra or terrible rap remixes its like watching a 90s rape scene by the end of credits     the cameos just came in for the pay check bill murray ernie hudson annie potts dan aykroyd and sigourney weaver as great as they are their cameos are extremely small and they really could not give a single solitary fuck to do anything because how can you blame them their roles are paperthin they might as well have not been in it    you know what the original plot of this movie was going to be having the old ghostbusters catch ghosts while handing down their torches to new ghostbusters the force awakensstyle that would have been much more appropriate and have given ghostbusters fans a nice bit of closure to the original movies while kickstarting a new franchise     but paul feig didnt want to make a sequel and just wanted to make a reboot with a stupid convoluted plot and thats what we got    i dont usually like to level myself with the more hateful crowds over a movie but i hope paul feig loses his job paul feig has done nothing but disrespect his own audience with his childish bullshit taking 144 million of sonys dollars and jerking off every step of the way to make a movie that is more like a sequel to adam sandlers pixels than anything resembling a competent film    paul feig wasted the precious time money and intelligence of myself and anyone else who was foolish enough to see this movie to prove that they werent assholes just because a shitforbrains egostroking director told them so    im glad this movie bombed as it deserves to its not even about being a ghostbusters fan anymore its about insulting your core audience who wanted to give you a chance to prove them wrong and that what theyd see would be good but now paul feig has failed at his job horribly and has ruined his own reputation and basically what im saying is that anything bad that happens to this film that kept it from being a successful franchise is all the failure of paul feig that he brought upon himself    and to those that say that this movie was a test to see if hwood would ever consider putting more female leads in movies and saying that the failure of the films success will reflect upon how hwood will see and think there is no market to be made with female leads let me put this stupid opinion to bed once and for all    feminist or not like you i also want to see more female leads in movies only if they are likable and wellwritten characters in a good story like sigourney weaver linda hamilton and uma thurman    hollywood does not give a single flying fuck about anything that has to do with being progressive or anything that has to do with political issues all they care about is if they can make a franchise out of a thing and female leads are not their main focus at all because the people running hwood are just a bunch of old rich crusty white men who dont know what adapting to market means so youre wasting your time and are deluded to think and feel that if a shitty comedy like this was the answer to your movement then youve clearly have no idea what it is you stand for    ghostbusters 2016 is a forgettable disgustinglyunfunny offensivelyboring and depressingly angerinducing piece of garbage that makes sony look more humiliated and more desperate to find a hit and studios will maybe think twice about hiring paul hackfraud feig in this industry because we do not need more directors like him making more shittier comedies and being disrespectful to the audience that buys your product and makes your business    210
Jul 26 2016,positive,surprisingly good the new cast was very funny overall with some great cameos from the classic cast a fun reimagining of a great movie hope they make another one
Jul 26 2016,positive,really cute movie 
Jul 26 2016,positive,i thought this movie did well with continuing the ghostbusters legacy
Jul 26 2016,positive,not as good as the original however a fun movie and was great to see the cameos
Jul 26 2016,positive,i had low expectations going into this movie there are so many talented people who came together to make this movie and yet it wasnt as grand as it could have been i laughed far fewer times during this movie then i did during the original but i sort of blame that on my age that old movie is timeless to people that is why this was the most hated trailer ever on youtube it delivered on my assumption it wouldnt be as good as the 1984 flick hollywood truly does push out these remakes without caring about the art of filmmaking its cgi heavy and honestly the above average rating it has gotten is likely due to a crutch of pity from the amount of sexism that the internet gave it   i did enjoy the ride while i was on it though there were constant callbacks that took me out of the movie a little but they got a rise out of me chris hemsworth was so goofy it got annoying  some of the funniest things were delivered by mckinnon  jones kate mckinnon overplays it which i like about her on snl and that carried over into being a positive in this film leslie jones is used more than ernie hudson the unqualified black addition and she comes in second as the ghostbuster who gave me the most laughs mccarthy and wiig are their usual selves but that comes across as slightly 2 dimensional  lastly chris hemsworth was so goofy it was annoying   should they have done a reboot in my opinion no but a 3rd installment wouldve likely fell short too as the 2nd wasnt that great if you recall maybe a continuation would have been better maybe it would have taken a whole different writer or maybe whole different group of talented individuals with different ideas
Jul 26 2016,positive,i really liked this reboot if that is what you want to call it  it started off a bit slow but picked up with a lot of fun and new things to see  i would definitely see it again
Jul 26 2016,positive,great remake of the hit eighties comedy blockbuster
Jul 26 2016,negative,wow just wow wasnt the worst loved new weapons hated the art design and didnt like the line or story what the did with the receptionist and jokes hit and mostly missfelt like billl murray didnt agree with the movie being against them was ironic in ways it didnt try to be
Jul 26 2016,positive,way better than i was expecting  didnt copy the original in the sense that it didnt try to hard but enough parodys and jokes cameos and familiar scenes that it was a really fun trip down memory lane  all female cast did great and appreciated their humor def worth watching
Jul 26 2016,negative,i tried so hard to like this movie i wanted to like it but honestly i just cant bring myself to do it       there was so much wrong with the directing in this movie and the jokes fell flat like the stay puffed thanksgiving day parade ghost balloon  melissa mccarthy had no real definable character kristen wiig left a lot to be desired in her character again i think this was a directors choices leslie jones although very animated and immensely talented was given very little room to shine until late in the movie which i admit were damn funny moments but she was left to play the stereotypical character filled with all the presence of a tyler perry movie the only character that truly had a believable and enjoyable character in this movie was kate mckinnon mckinnon was absolutely spot on with all her deliveries whenever she was in a scene i couldnt help but be drawn to her because she honestly made this movie     the cameos of the original cast that actually decided to sign on in the first place were insulting at best the small nod to harold ramis in the beginning and in the end credits was more like a slap in the face to the fans leaving many personally put off from the movie even more than they already were     to those saying im viewing this with nostalgic glasses i went into this knowing nothing could remake that first chill up my spine or the first initial excitement of wanting to be a ghostbuster as i bounced out of the theater as a child i never went into this expecting them to bust the roof off of the franchise or top it in anyway i just wanted good solid chemistry on screen a good script that honored where it came from and actors who actually cared about the source material     sadly they just didnt cross the finish line on this paul feig made some terrible decisions for the editing for the script and for the direction he gave to the actors of this movie with the kind of talent that was in this movie he should have been able to make a much better movie than we were given     in closing this script should never have been green lit it needed serious work and a better antagonist the biggest spit in the face was the zinger  nod to the original movie at the end of the credits if youve seen it you know what im talking about that was like the cherry on the shit sundae i definitely dont think this was worth the price of a movie ticket and sony as well as feig should really consider actually diving into the ghostbusters fancult immersing themselves entirely and then talking to the demographic they just alienated with this release before doing the next movie    please dont screw this up twice
Jul 26 2016,negative,obviously this film has divided the fan base of this franchise one end have people protesting this film while the other half have people claiming the protesters as sexists when you look at this film and the lead up to its release one has to look at two things that play a major key in dividing ghostbusters fans its the fact that hollywood obsession with remakes and nostalgia  im a fan of the ghostbusters 1 and 2 like so many im tired of remakes i understand taking films that we probably unknown to a huge population however taking a well known franchise and remaking it will draw a lot of criticism as a fan of films my favorite trilogy is back to the future i will out rightly protest any attempt for a remake because it seems that hollywood would stoop to any low for a cash grab we all have a list of movies that should never be remade the godfather star wars etc but the fact this film that is so well beloved by so many a film that people still to this day watch and celebrate during conventions and halloween parties gets remade for a little update just because the first film is over 30 years old does not make it obsolete the characters jokes and frights still hold up today similar to the wizard of oz willy wonka or old disney films ghostbusters is a rite of passage for most kids growing up a majority of those who shunned this movie were not sexists clearly the fact that the studios felt that this needed to be remade is offensive im part of that majority  nostalgia has been the hot trend for a while if youre an adult everything you loved when you were a kid are being revived for this generation from products cartoons tv shows and movies nostalgia is a cash cow for christ sakes i have literally driven to every supermarket in my area to find some hic ecto cooler only to be disappointed with being left with paying 350 a can at the theater there was a moment when i realized how ridiculous it is for a grown ass man driving all over to find a beverage that was cherished during his child hood believe me the words grow up and let go came into my mind on plenty occasions what im getting at and i also reflect upon this on the tmnt review is that its hard for us nostalgia fiends to let go of the past obviously nostalgia fans were going to be dissappointed due to the effect that these films had on their childhoods whether the film wouldve been great or not it was deemed to experience a lot of criticism which is why i came into this film with an open mind i did not rewatch the original and i waited a week to prepare myself even though the first trailer sucked i had an open mind i like paul feiges work and what i love about his prior work is how women are represented the humor in his films feels natural and the characters are fleshed out so i was surprised when this film is so different from his other films now granted sony probably provided some input to make sure the film would be profitable however paul feige should have some clout being a successful comedic director the jokes are forced and juvenile the pacing is rushed and it definitely had a lot of scenes cut mccarthy and wiig are underused in this film they are two hilarious actresses with mccarthys quips and hilarious comebacks that is evident in her prior films is absent wiig is another actress who can play awkward characters in prior films went against her type in this film this wouldve been a perfect time for those two to play those character types mckinnon plays the awkward scientist kind of a female version of egon just a little more extroverted with her awkwardness hell mckinnons hair even resembles egon from the cartoon the real ghostbusters a bit mckinnons character was riding on the border of being annoying surprisingly leslie jones is toned down when compared to the trailers i did get a few laughs from chris hemsworth who plays the dumb assistant besides his performance i did like the joke of the ghostbusters comparing the new york mayor to the mayor of jaws  for a remake it follows the same beats of the original the first scene is reminiscent of the library scene the rock concert scene is a lot like the hotel scene in the first films the characters even step aside when one of the ghostbusters are testing out the equipment for the first time the building that serves as the location as the third act has a history of paranormal theres even a scene where the ghostbusters imagine there own destructor i also didnt like the fact that the villain who a human being that controls the ghost usually some supernatural event causes the ghosts our dimension the villian was very one dimensional the film doesnt even explain how hes created the equipment that harness the energy of the paranormal the cameos were lackluster obviously they were shoe horned for catchphrases  the 3d is great perfect use during the ghost sequences and whenever the ghostbusters fired their proton packs ghostbusters 2016 had a lot going against it when it was announced in order to defeat the naysayers it had to be at least good i had hope since those involved have produced good material however you take a movie that had smart humor that felt organic and remake the film with forced and dumb humor it feels like a slap in the face similar to bvs people are going to see this out of curiosity my last gripe with this film it made me miss the ray parker ghostbusters song as much as i heard the orchestral and good charlottemissy elliot versions it made me miss the original song even when i was never a fan of the song
Jul 26 2016,negative,see in 3dcorny dialogue
Jul 26 2016,positive,i went in not trying to compare to the original so my review would be unbiased  i was unimpressed with the beginning but then it picked up quick  chris hemsworth was by far the worst choice to be a dimwitted secretary his acting skills stop at thor but the jokes thrills and rapid storyline far outshined the schlock  the cameos were awesome  staying through the credits made it even better  no it wasnt the original  it wasnt trying to be  the gadgets were hilarious the car was ghetto and the buildings were fun  the nemesis was by far top notch as he had a better back story than some historical reference  also with limited funds they didnt come out with super high tech gear at first but gradually worked in upgrades that made more sense  trial and error aspect  see it in 3d  really adds to it  not a bad remake and im waiting for the next one as they eluded to
Jul 26 2016,positive,my husband and i smiled the whole time lots of action great special effect and some out right laughs when i went with my friend she jumped out of her seat 2x i loved the whole cast and i especially enjoyed cameo appearance of all the old ghostbusters stars it was a bit painful to watch chris hemsworths character act dumber than a box of rocks but the adorable dancing scene at the end made up for it
Jul 26 2016,positive,popcorn film better than expected enjoyable
Jul 26 2016,positive,way better than i expected it to be definitely recommend it
Jul 26 2016,positive,funny interesting and well i dont see why so many hate on this one
Jul 26 2016,negative,this movie made no sense its sad because they had a great cast of hilarious women but a weak screenplay storyline  theres ghosts why there just there and they are evil and mad why they just are because we need a huge fight scene ok theres a bad guy why cause he is weird ok we have our protagonists who are considered outcasts why cause they think there are ghosts ok at least the original one had an actual interesting storyline such a waste of time
Jul 26 2016,negative,it was so bad halfway through i walked out with my son wanting my money back
Jul 26 2016,negative,stale and blasphemy against the original films worth just a few chuckles and a good intro see it for free if youre interested
Jul 26 2016,positive,absolutely enjoyed the movie  this holds its own as a film and pays lots of respect to the original  the humor is unique for the female leads compared to their all male counterparts   all comparisons aside  i had fun at the movie with the music the story the visuals and some of the jokes  it was worth my time
Jul 26 2016,positive,i just went and saw this movie its not as good as i thought it would of been but was still a great movie kevin and kate mckinnon truly the best part of this movie i like kristen wiig but in this movie she was not her best cecily strong leslie jones and of course kate mckinnon were awesome i loved the way they got the original people from ghostbusters in the movie
Jul 26 2016,positive,funny cheeky and all around a good time i think they did a great job capturing the fun of the original  leslie jones was great but kate mckinnon stole the show for sure
Jul 26 2016,positive,couldnt stop laughing
Jul 26 2016,negative,controversy is a funny thing isnt it sometimes it is deserved while other times it is completely unwarranted no matter what the reason is there is always a firestorm and thus is the case for the rebootremake of ghostbusters i am a fan of the franchise and am unashamed of it the first ghostbusters is one of my all time favorite films and when i heard about this movie i was taken back not because of the all female cast but the cast they chose in general however despite all the conversation about this movie this is a review of the film not the controversy with that said i have to admit that this iteration of ghostbusters simply isnt a good film and is a huge disappointment on all fronts    the main issue here is that the story just isnt there the story in this film which is set in a world where the original ghostbusters never happened follows a new group of ghostbusters that try to stop these spirits that are appearing in new york city the first thirty minutes had a massive amount of potential for characters to shine and showcase a solid story but the story simply goes nowhere there is absolutely no drama or any tangible form of character development past the first act without these elements you just cant care for anyone in this movie granted there is a small subplot between kristen wiig and melissa mccarthys characters that had potential as well as a small message about bullying however there is no effort to flesh these things out and the film fails because of it    also falling flat shockingly is the comedy and the one liners writers katie dippold and paul feig know how to make funny movies and they have proved it before it is simply baffling that they wrote such an unfunny film all of the jokes here are just flat and have no real punch line to them it seem dippold and feig relied on awkward comedy to the point where we get acclimated to it far too early not only do they rely on that but there are far too many puns that reference back to the previous films the film does honor the original films in some nice ways but the puns take over the script and this movie begins to feel like a bad rip off by the third act    the cast here does okay but they all seem uninspired and fall back to the tropes they are known for kristen wiig plays her normal awkward character and while there is nothing wrong with that it just feels done before when a movie like this could have been truly innovative melissa mccarthy phones in her performance and delivers the same performance we have seen from her since her breakout role in bridesmaids leslie jones is a standout here and she genuinely does the best she can with the material she was given kate mckinnon is absolutely dreadful here and i dont understand what happened she is genuinely funny on snl and i was excited to see her in this movie but here she is just so over the top it is distracting chris hemsworth is also wasted and while he does provide some okay laughs you can see that he was just another missed opportunity    paul feig also directed this movie and he clearly had a certain vision for this film but maybe he wasnt the right choice he placed some well placed easter eggs and homages to include longtime fans and to his credit it worked however you cant help but feel like the scale should have been bigger and that he held back there are some solidly paced scenes but when it was time for the big action climax it was just underwhelming and quite frankly unoriginal with as many problems that this film has feig could have made this stand out but he just plays it safe and the film suffers because of it    overall ghostbusters 2016 is a bad film but it isnt the worst movie of all time the story is awful majority performances are bland the characters are forgettable and by the end of the film you just feel disappointed and ripped off there really was a lot of potential here but all of it was squandered at the start of the second act with that said i cant honestly recommend this film to anybody if you do decide to see this wait until this is on hbo or starz
Jul 26 2016,positive,mostly medicore hit or miss comedy overall its just ok
Jul 26 2016,negative,wish i had saved my money the story line was horribly written i liked melissa mccarthy in spy and dentity theft but she did a terrible job in this movie this movie tries too hard too push a feminist agenda the characters are underdeveloped and uninteresting  the cool parts are the graphics and the cameos from the original movie the final battle scene had me routing for the ghosts to win so i wouldnt die of boredom
Jul 26 2016,negative,this should have been a third movie not a reboot way to lame for a standalone movie think amazing spiderman or micheal jacksons oz the only thing funny about this movie is the fact its a reboot i am ok with the female cast thought it was a good idea but ecto1 should have been found in the garage by egon  or vinckmans daughter would have been way better than to have a stereotype with a caddy although leslie was the best just hate what they did to her character lame all the way around even using the stay puff really the writer of this just stinks this movie should end up in a containment center slimed by the real slimer
Jul 26 2016,negative,as a reboot it falls flat as a modern comedy with more references than jokes its not the worst thing ive ever seen good for a cheap laugh leslie jones was the only realistic character and she was pretty funny just dont go into the theater expecting to see a ghostbusters movie 
Jul 26 2016,negative,hands down the worst movie ive ever seen if you ever do a movie like this again please do not cast melissa mccarthy she tries way too hard to be funny and it comes off as stupid and annoying
Jul 26 2016,positive,i loved this movie and the classics too i dont understand people who arent happy with it the way i see it is that you cant look at this movie as a remake of the classic ghostbusters this is a new movie with the same premise but different plot melissa mccarthy and kristen wiig were great together as was expected and kate mckinnon had me in tears from laughing so much
Jul 26 2016,positive,this movie was fucking awesome i loved it there was so much bad press about it i cant understand honestly have you guys watched the first 3 ghostbusters i mean recently theyre really kind of boring im not sure where this pedestal came from i too loved those movies as a kid but lets face it they werent even bill murrays best work back then as an adult please rewatch all your old favorites before you see the new sequel so you can stop being such a gd old person about things well back in my day ghostbusters had really crappy effects and only dudes and we liked it that way kate mckinnons character in this movie is way more iconic than any of the characters in the original ghostbusters there werent even really jokes in old ghostbusters it was weirdly serious and schlocky theres fucking action in this movie there is a fight scene and its badass i swear to god if theyd cast like andy samberg and kenan thompson you wouldve been all over this shit
Jul 26 2016,positive,seems ok but still in a want to see mode
Jul 26 2016,positive,a worthy successor to the original as a huge fan and not stuck with a stick in my ass because it has female leads  in terms of how good it is id place it between ghostbusters 1 and 2 this really needs a second movie  tons of fun
Jul 26 2016,positive,not that bad as reboots go  doesnt come close to the original but still quite funny
Jul 26 2016,positive,fun and funny an excellent update to the original  i watched the young adults around me who were watching this as their first theater experience of the ghostbusters and their experience was mirroring mine from when i watched the original  curiously i found the various cameos of the original cast more distracting than amusing  the film stood well without the shoutouts
Jul 26 2016,positive,it was a great movie i suggest seeing it in 3d it makes the experience a lot better
Jul 26 2016,negative,its bad really bad
Jul 26 2016,negative,a lousy unreboot that screwed up the franchise also the 2nd
Jul 26 2016,negative,pales in comparison to the original is right pale as the dead without the usual special effects i cant see how this film would be entertaining
Jul 26 2016,neutral,i liked the characters except kevin but the jokes and kevin were written by someone who doesnt know what comedy is im guessing its the same person who directed a melee fight with ghosts  the effects were great although im disappointed that the proton packs didnt make that distinctive sound  kevin and the poor writing let this film down much to my surprise given the criticism id heard
Jul 26 2016,negative,man i really wanted to like this movie although i lost a bit of hope when i learned this was a reboot and not a sequel it is poorly cast except i enjoyed leslie jones and melissa mccarthy horribly written and i mean this is horribly written and tries way too hard to be funny kristen wiig seems to be the female version of vince vaughn and is the same characteractor in every movie so she became quickly annoying chris hemsworths character was too over the top and acting as though the original ghostbusters never happened yet having the cameos of original cast turned out to be a very bad glaring mistake i can actually go on but this was bad enough im just going to stop here id love to hit paul feig for screwing up what was a great childhood memory of mine
Jul 26 2016,positive,an enjoyable movie far better than i was expecting based on the original trailer i would agree with the general consensus that its better than gb ii but not as good as the original not many laughoutloud lines but a general feeling of cheerful fun throughout in a year that brought us batman vs superman its nice to see a beloved franchise being treated with respect by the director and cast
Jul 26 2016,positive,i laughed quite a bit and overall i definitely enjoyed it they hit all the right callbackscameos except for crossing the streams and it was a good mix of new and old definitely recommend it for fans of the original or for people new to the franchise cant wait for the sequel i cant believe how many people left during the credits and missed the aftercredit scenehave these people not seen any marvel movies lately you have to wait for the very end
Jul 26 2016,neutral,not as bad as i expected trouble is i expected it to be appalling therefore it was just bad totally unnecessary reboot
Jul 26 2016,positive,good movie  well deserving of the ghostbusters name
Jul 26 2016,positive,this movie was much better than i expected despite all the bad talk about i found myself laughing at the jokes and enjoying a wellwritten plot
Jul 26 2016,positive,very good its a must see
Jul 26 2016,negative,weak should have just shown original movie again
Jul 26 2016,positive,a stunningly good film that throws all the controversy about casting straight out of the window funny scary with cameos from all the surviving originals an enjoyable ride from start to finish recommended
Jul 26 2016,positive,expectations  incredibly low    overall  really really enjoyed it nostalgia  fest new approach and comedy but definitely a faithful nod to the originals with lots of surprises to put a big grin your face
Jul 26 2016,positive,this is a movie that straddles the line of being worth just enough to pay 10 dollars for a ticket but not good enough for me to watch a second time on my dime if youre going to watch it or even somewhat curious do so while in theaters the good parts of this movie are made well because of the screen size you watch it on the only good surprise of the movie was the lack of feminist propaganda many people thought would take center stage in this movie
Jul 26 2016,positive,one of the best films i have ever seen this film incleudes four different and amazing women that i find so relatable most films with a female lead i find it hard to relate to them they are usualy perfectly beautiful and are never very important this film has people i can personally understand and relate to they are strong brave and they look like normal lovely human beings this is a funny and empowering film i recomend for anyone i cant wait for more films like this
Jul 26 2016,negative,absolute insult to the franchise not funny jokes were lame seen better acting in eastenders and thats really hard to imagine please dont make any more
Jul 26 2016,positive,excelent movie was funny and clever had nice pacing and the action scenes where great highlight being character holtzmans badassery    great movie amidst a sea of unreasonable hate from clickbait youtuber videos and the most fun i had in a movie this year
Jul 26 2016,negative,a cast of funny people in a movie that isnt that funny at all majority of the jokes fall flat and are very juvenile and borderline offensive it is only ghostbusters by name it insults the legacy of the brand and tries too hard on many levels the movie isnt bad because it stars women the movie is bad because it is bad     grade c
Jul 26 2016,negative,yeah i actually watched this movie with my mother and she hated it even more than i did her words were if you are going to choose women comedians atleast get one that is some where near as funny as bill murray i agree i think tina fey would have made an absolutely great lead but they didnt have her amy poehler would have been good but they didnt have her shit even sarah silverman with the right directing would have been good but they didnt have her instead they have a chick whose main joke is that she is fat fucking funny right and the rest are the saturday night live cast you cant even remember even when snl in general is shitting the bed now    that being said even if it took a classic comedies name and dragged it through the mud it dosnt deserve the shit its getting it dosnt even deserve the praise it is getting from the obviously terrified male critics who cant say why the movie is the funniest this summer the movie is honestly just another shit remake that people blew out of proportion and then sony found a way to make that benefit them if this got no attention and crap reviews we wouldnt have all this bullshit instead we will probably have a sequel just because this movie made way too much money and they will try to make the brown drippy lightning strike twice with the next one
Jul 26 2016,positive,while i was initially sceptical this would be a b grade rip off of the original the 4 girls in the lead role pulled off a really good movie  what made the film was that is was more a light hearted version with no actors playing serious roles eg the mayor or walter pec  but all played a part in making the film quiet comical stand out performance by comedian kate mckinnon along with great special effects and cameo apperances from the original cast made this a highly entertaining film to top it off the movie did not resort to lewd suggestions and endless swearing making this remake a must see
Jul 26 2016,negative,holy moley what a mess  i just watched the new specterbreakers movie i had to force myself not to walk out of it a few times its a tangled mess bad editing disjointed story telling and what i hope was adlibbing and not scripted was worse than amature improve night and the jr chuckle hut there were giant swathes of this movie that were missing that actually get referred to by the dialog i was actually telling the characters to shut the hell up at one point mumbling on and on to fill every available second with their voices in the hopes something funny spills out of their mouths the characters are annoying all of them even the cameos it was edited like some ham handed amature film maker was putting together a public access carpet store commercial for beer money i swear i could hear the chunks of movie clunk together at one point this movie should have been ghostnado on the syfy channel
Jul 26 2016,negative,the basic problem with this film is the feig  mccarthy collaboration their brand of comedy goes over the top with the amount of unnecessary gratuitous crudeness and in other movies like spy the outright profanity i expected some irreverence and coarse language but because some might be good more is not better and this one has too much it isnt a crudeness contest in which the biggest pile of it wins in addition this is the fourth feigmccarthy collaboration in a row with the same brand of comedy pervading all of them its getting stale having lost its novelty now and the general audience it appeals to is narrowing as a result theyre losing market segment feig and mccarthy need to recognize that successful collaborations dont just pump out more of the same style work they continuously leverage on their synergy and versatility to create something new and fresh in well executed movies with good plots and scripts examples of this are scorseses work with de niro and dicaprio tarantinos work with samuel l jackson woody allens work with mia farrow and diane keaton and ingmar bermans with bibi andersson ingrid thulin and liv ulmann until they do that their market segment will continue to shrink until its a niche thats ok if its what they want but it wont achieve box office blockbusters with it especially when taking on the remake curse with a huge budget movie the fourth time out the box office gross trajectory this film is on globally will post about an 80m loss for the studio and other investors that should speak volumes to the vociferous shrieking and whining sjws playing the misogyny card
Jul 26 2016,positive,hilarious entertainment that doesnt take itself too seriously but gets a bit ridiculous at times    it also is very crude
Jul 25 2016,negative,rubbish not even close to the original
Jul 25 2016,negative,i think the porn parody of this had better jokes
Jul 25 2016,negative,this may have worked better as a cartoon
Jul 25 2016,positive,a must see for anybody that is somebody and everyone who is anybody
Jul 25 2016,positive,it does a good job as a reboot to the the classic movie keeping in some spirit of the original while also having some originality though some jokes are a but bad or cliche
Jul 25 2016,neutral,i wanted to like this movie more but in the end it was meandering and tacked together like a meh episode of saturday night live guest starring starring chris hemsworth i personally hate chris hemsworth and he wasnt even the worst thing about this movie kate mckinnon feels like the only thing authentic or enjoyable about this film the rest of the movie is basically a ghostbusters themed improv night at a comedy club and not a particularly good one at that it never really gets the balance of comedy and blockbuster action right and after starting off at a brisk pace becomes disjointed and finishes the last 3rd of the movie with an overlong session of neon lit posturing by all the cast members     i enjoyed some of the dialogue but the movie doesnt capitalise on the strength of its comedic talent there are no moments like jason stathams monologue in spy or kristen wiigs wigout hur hur in bridesmaids which are better examples of the kind of comedy paul feig is capable of the movies lethargic 3rd act does kind of remind me of spys fizzling tail end which shows paul feigs lack of skill at directing big action set pieces as finales     it was great to see the old cast of the ghostbusters and they seemed to be spaced out evenly just to keep people interested because otherwise the film was frequently dull and almost bored with itself some of the best scenes of the movie were playing in the credits which is a really poor reason to sit through a whole movie just to get to     im disappointed because i wanted to see new ghostbusting characters that were memorable for their individual quirks not melissa and kristen getting slimed and goofing off in ghostbusters cosplay for an hour and a half at least good cosplayers stay in character
Jul 25 2016,positive,im not  sure i understand all the hate  it was funny the pacing was good and the comedy was actually funny      i get the internet hate machine has been in full force since the first trailer but lets be real here its not bad  its exactly what you would expect and quite well done
Jul 25 2016,positive,growing up in the 80s other kids had transformers or gi joe or heman but i was a ghostbusters kid i fell in love with the 1984 original movie slept below the poster for most of my childhood and obsessively collected all of the action figures watched with glee the animated tv series and hold the world and its characters in a special personal place the 1984 movie is such a perfect blend of buddy comedy the supernatural and action that nobody has really been able to fully replicate this special film alchemy as well since including director ivan reitman he tried in vain with evolution when the word broke that there was going to be a new ghostbusters remake some trepidation from fans could be expected its sacred ground to many director paul feig bridesmaids insisted that he wanted to have an allfemale team of ghostbusters and thats when the internet lost its collective mind the movie and its stars have been beset with hateful misogynistic and in the case of leslie jones racist harassment the internet didnt want smelly girls playing with its toys it became part of a larger war between feminists and retrograde mens rights activist crybabies some people wanted it to be succeed just because of he gender of its leads and others wanted it to fail for the very reasons i just wanted a good ghostbusters movie regardless of what bathroom the busters utilize     erin kristen wiig is an esteemed science academic trying to turn the page on her past her friend and fringe scientist abby melissa mccarthy has republished the book about paranormal they wrote together which ruins erins chance at tenure from her colleagues her ire is shortlived as erin abby and her wacky nuclear scientist associate jillian holtzmann kate mckinnon experience a real dead ghost their slimefilled encounter with the undead reawakens erins love of the paranormal and the three of them join forces patti jones is an mta worker who leaves her job and joins the gals after her own experience with a ghost in the new york subway somebody is trying to open a portal between the living and the dead and these ghostbusters gotta bust some ghosts    my initial apprehension melted away within the movies first twenty seconds when it already had me laugh out loud twice antiirish fence theres a consistent genial absurdity that kept me engaged and entertained and this is typified by the strong comic camaraderie of the four leads i enjoyed spending time with these ladies and i enjoyed their interactions so when scenes could creep up on overstaying their welcome from a pacing standpoint something of a feig staple i gave them more leeway and felt my patience rewarded i dont know how to make it plainer than this i am not a leslie jones fan and i liked leslie jones in this movie i have found jones to be alltoo often on saturday night live a onenote comic presence always loud and brash and hitting the same joke again and again with little variation with ghostbusters she actually plays a character capable in her own right and a straight man for the other characters these women were goofy gross a queef joke within holtzmanns first appearance but they also enjoyed one anothers company there are internal conflicts sure but their enjoyment of working together of displaying their knowhow of the joys of discovering the realm of the paranormal create a bond that helps seal the characters with the audience whatever the scenario i was confident i would laugh from these characters and i did    there is a lightness to the movie that makes it all the more appealing settling into pleasurable summer fare this story is as much about the formation of the ghostbusters as anything else in the original film they just sort of have their ghostbusting gear all of a sudden with the remake we watch the trial and error process of bringing all that tech to life its a fun process to see their business from the ground floor so to speak and their fight for larger credibility murray himself even shows up as a paranormal debunker who scoffs at their claims the ladies are the lovable underdogs in this world     the real reason that feigs movies work is the interaction of his boisterous and often brilliant casts and ghostbusters is another example wiig and mccarthy have a natural chemistry together honed from bridesmaids and their backandforth banter will often find punch lines in odd places mccarthy has always been her best under feigs direction seriously go watch spy if you havent while abby is a less outspoken character than were accustomed to from her mccarthy still has a commanding presence and is the one who lassos the other funny characters back into a sustainable orbit you spell science with a y and i dont think you know that thats wrong ive stated above my positive feelings on jones she brings a welcomed perspective to the team and often serves as the voice of the audience like a moment where she looks inside a room filled with mannequins calls it nightmare stuff and wisely keeps walking mckinnon is the true breakout star going for broke in a deadpan anarchic silliness that is murrayesque she also displays a funky near pansexual sense of excitement with the world around her she licks the radioactive barrels of her proton pack in jubilation mckinnon is a constant source of mirth in the movie and has some of the best oneliners its 2040 our president is a plant another breakout might be chris hemsworth in comedy his dimwitted and inept receptionist is perhaps too dumb to even function hemsworth just commits to his characters straightfaced stupidity and it produces big laughs     not everything in the movie works as well together as the ensemble the movies tone takes a giant leap once the third act commences with its apocalyptic ghost showdowns you can sense that feig isnt nearly as passionate about action heroics and cgi  example the movie sets up a largescale dance sequence and we never see it until the scene appears during the end credits that seems like a waste the character arc between abby and erin isnt quite as developed as the movie needs for the emotional reconnection at the very end to hit as much as i loved mckinnon in the movie her character is more a collection of quirks than a person the cameos from the original cast are mostly awful and kill amusement watching dan akroyd as a cab driver say he aint afraid of no ghosts made me roll my eyes and wish i could delete this from my memory the less obvious nods are better fan service like a character referencing mass hysteria or erin frantically pressing her body against a restaurants large glass window the stay puft marshmallow man as a parade float is a nice touch though the main villain is feeble but i can see how a dude with a grievous sense of entitlement could itself be a feminist statement on the hostility that women face in todays world there are some logical consistency issues when the busters go from trapping ghosts to shooting them and blowing them up but it wasnt enough to derail my sense of fun the worst thing about this ghostbusters is the new theme song from fall out boy and missy elliot     is the new ghostbusters a significant step in terms of feminism or is it overblown as some critics contend the topic is unavoidable given the spirited furor over this remake it has the most disliked trailer in youtube history though to be fair that was not a good trailer first ill acknowledge that the world doesnt need the opinion of a heterosexual white male on the topic of inclusion but id like to say that there is something about positive representation its the same reason i approve of sulu being gay in the newest star trek its not for me to say what is and is not empowering for a group of people who often lack positive representation in media nor am i arguing that every representation of a group needs to be positive that swings in a direction where well intentioned protection becomes condescending people can be good people can be bad people can be brilliant people can be dumb no one pool of dna has ownership over these human traits however the reality of hollywood is that it is often a poor representation of diversity it is because of this that i say ghostbusters deserves some praise for portraying a plot around four women that doesnt involve boyfriends weddings marriages pregnancies any sort of romantic coupling and doesnt pit them against one another this is an action movie with a female ensemble three of whom are in their 40s and all of whom dont exactly fit with hollywoods standard conception of the attractive female lead they dont dress provocatively for the male gaze the default setting for strong heroine in hollywood is often sexy deadly they dont make fun of one anothers body types they stand up for one another when people in power attack they love what they do i think there will be a swath of the public that recognizes themselves on screen maybe for the first time and i think there is genuine merit to this     somewhere amidst all the hype and hate the new ghostbusters emerges as a pleasant and enjoyably silly summer comedy feigs movie pays homage to the original including borrowing many of the general plot beats force awakensstyle but steps out onto its own territory the 2016 ghostbusters is not slavish to the original but recreates what made it work a strong core group that meets the experimental and outlandish with droll irony i think i laughed more with the 2016 ghostbusters than the 1984 ghostbusters it has some flaws and some pacing issues but i was enjoying these characters so much to mind as a lifelong ghostbusters fan i would gladly watch a sequel with these characters and this world once more this wont replace the fond feelings i have for the original nor was it ever supposed to this allfemale ghostbusters doesnt take away what fans have loved it simply adds another chapter with a new batch of entertaining characters and if a part of the audience can better imagine themselves strapping on the proton packs and going along for the ride then i dont see what the harm lies with representation    nates grade b
Jul 25 2016,negative,needed more humour  funny characters but never really went anywhere  the story in particular felt rushed 1 star for slimers triumphant return
Jul 25 2016,positive,i thought it was a great and funny movie
Jul 25 2016,positive,as hilarious and as the original additionally the action and special effects kept me glued to the screen in a way the original couldnt
Jul 25 2016,positive,the original ghostbusters and ghostbusters cartoons were something i loved as a kid though they were fairly old by the time i got around to them this new reboot of the series is amazing with an unexpected cast of women and men who kept me cracking up and on the edge of my seat with the mix of humor action and plot if i could give this more stars i would the action sequences were well made the writing was fresh and the humor just rolled in for new initiates and lovers of the originals alike    it really blew me away the quality of the characters and the story trust me when i say im probably going to see it two more times before i preorder the bluray
Jul 25 2016,positive,a funny and honorable remake for a classic a mix of the classic movie with modern jokes that doesnt force comedy
Jul 25 2016,positive,this film was a lot of fun i cant make heads or tails of the bad reviews cute lots of laughs great cameos cool gadgets solid plot evenall in all easily 4 stars
Jul 25 2016,positive,i just saw it and it was awesome it was obvious the whole time that it was made by people who had a genuine love for the originals my only complaint might be that it was a little all over the place and i would have wanted more chemistry between erin and abby but i definitely recommend it wholeheartedly
Jul 25 2016,negative,one of the worst movies ive seen in the last 10 years terrrrrrrible annoying not funny
Jul 25 2016,negative,you know how there is a stereotype that women arent funny yeah well this movie only enforces it they try way too hard and it only leaves you cringing
Jul 25 2016,positive,it was a good pg13 bridesmaids but they really shouldve upped the ante on the 3d as it was subpar
Jul 25 2016,positive,stunning visuals  awesome cast clever writing noisy theme song  it loses a star for simply being a reboot  yeah im one of those types
Jul 25 2016,positive,had a great time  not a feeble attempt at retelling the same story laughed all the way through the movie  kid friendly and skips the tired addition of a love story brilliant funny women kicking ghost butt
Jul 25 2016,positive,it is te best comedy film at 2016
Jul 25 2016,negative,i saw this movie with my two sons 1210 the nicest thing i can say about it is 10 and 12 is the perfect age for this movie other than that it is junk dont waste your money rewatch the original  and very comfortable in the fact that you are watching a far superior made and acted movie  kristen wiig was the one good performance  all else should have been scrapped honestly this movie never should have been made no wonder it is failing at the box office
Jul 25 2016,positive,so i have a confession to make i only saw the original 1984 film a couple of days before i saw this remake of ghostbusters this means i may not have has as much of an attachment to the original as other people who grew up with it did having said that seeing the trailer prior to seeing the movie definitely piqued my interest supernatural beings kristen wiig melissa mccarthy and with paul feig at the helm i knew this movie was going to be right up my alley    this is one very rare instance of when a remake of a movie actually brings something new to the table with visual effects that make the ghosts look creepier than ever teamed with an allgirl team of buttkicking busters and a very handsome but notsobright secretary in the form of chris hemsworth you cant help but enjoy this movie it has the right amount of laughs right amount of action and the right amount of cameos no spoilers here youll have to see it for yourself    after the success of this one i wont be surprised if a sequel has already been greenlit this is a movie that lends itself to both older and younger generations alike fans of the original will appreciate the various nods and references that they can relate to and the younger audience can experience the joys the older fans felt over 30 years ago    motherofpopcornwordpresscom
Jul 25 2016,negative,one of the most boring movies i have seen in years funny no the best part was the old characters
Jul 25 2016,positive,saw it with dayna yesterday we enjoyed it everyone in the theater was laughing its not perfect but it didnt suck either
Jul 25 2016,positive,great popcorn flick with a fun plot and excellent use of cameos cast really seemed t have real chemistry
Jul 25 2016,negative,not even a good effort 
Jul 25 2016,negative,this movie was complete shit i have no idea how this got a fresh rating obviously these critics have been bought since normal people rate this garbage
Jul 25 2016,positive,lovely comic performances and a fresh script well done to all involved
Jul 25 2016,negative,ghostbusters  initial reaction can the ladies be as good as the guys  main characters  erin gilbert abby yates jillian holtzmann three scientists played by kristen wiig melissa mccarthy and kate mckinnon  patty tolan a worker in the transit system played by leslie jones    plot summary  when three friends get together they accidentally find a ghost hiding in a mansion  and catch the encounter on film  but things have come to a dead end for erin abby and jillian    that all changes when patty shows up and talks about another ghost in the underground transit system  when they investigate they find out there are a lot more ghosts showing up in new york than ever before    and theres a pattern as to where these ghosts are showing up  someone is pulling strings behind the scenes and lining things up for a massive event in the near future    scoring  main characters  these ladies are trying their best to put in some comedy in the film but i dont see much chemistry between all four of them  these pieces just do not fit well together score 4    supporting cast  the crew hires a hunky brainless guy in order to be their secretary  which gives the film some life  but the main bad guy is just your average take over the world type  hes not developed at all and is there just for the girls to stop  score 3    plot  this is one plot that seems contrived to me  we get the pieces of whats going on but the way they fit together felt rushed  and the answer is found a bit too easily  score 3    originality  this film tries to be different from the original film but these ladies can do far more than they do on screen  score 4    violence factor  in the original the ghosts are caught in traps  but in this film they get destroyed in some cases with very little effort from the ghostbusters themselves  not the battling i was going for  score 4    other moral issues  this film is supposed to show that these ladies can do anything the guys can do  but it felt more like a weak effort to critic proof the film than anything else  score 3    final score out of 60 21 score 35  this couldve been a great film  but it needed a better story and a better team of ladies serving as ghostbusters
Jul 25 2016,negative,i was originally excited about this movie upon hearing the news of a new ghostbusters because i so loved the film of a generation previous i never heard much more than it would be a remake of the original there are a few positive qualities to this movie such as fall out boy doing an amazing job of the new theme song the incredible cgi qualityand starring my favorite avenger chris hemsworth but they pale in comparison to the pitfalls of this movie first of all the queefing jokes and general immaturity of most of the characters really sucked a lot of the comedy potential out of this movie secondly the script was so feminist influenced i wouldnt have been surprised if anita sarkeesian personally wrote the script this feminist influence really takes away from the whole female badass image that was given to them if they wanted to portray true female badassery take a lesson from ellen ripley lara croft or beatrice prior from their respective series finally the way they portrayed chris hemsworth was a sort of dumb intern who had no more potential than eye candy for the protagonists was disrespecting to chris hemsworths acting prowess and career for this esteemed actor overall this movie is a shallow lowiq feminist remake of a classic action comedy with all the right music and visuals with a severe deficit in actual plot and comedy appeal i gave one star for the theme song and half a star for chris hemsworth
Jul 25 2016,positive,couldnt stop laughing
Jul 25 2016,positive,cute movie with great special effects the only way to  see it is 3d
Jul 25 2016,positive,actually the movie was really funny the cast is great especially kate mckinnon who stoles the film go and see it
Jul 25 2016,positive,surprisingly fun and enjoyable while imperfect overall the movie was very fun with good characters and an interesting story the fact that it avoided low hanging fruit for jokes was actually refreshing really my only complaint was that the villain seemed a bit bland when there was actually some good potential for more so it feels like a bit of a waste
Jul 25 2016,positive,on par with the original
Jul 25 2016,positive,wonderful funny incredible women doing everything i always wanted to do as a ghostbuster
Jul 25 2016,positive,the 2016 reboot of ghostbusters might not be able to compare to the original but it stands impressively on its own to provide the requisite action and laughs to satisfy viewers courtesy of the sharply comedic acting performances from its leading cast
Jul 25 2016,positive,really enjoyed it very funny  preferred it to the original
Jul 25 2016,negative,one of the 5 worst movies i have ever seen not even worth waiting for video
Jul 25 2016,positive,i came into the movie skeptical  id heard a lot of negative press and im a big fan of the original but i have to say this movie was great the characters were hilarious and unforced the plot developed at the right pace and the multitude of nods to the original film and actors was perfection    i loved it
Jul 25 2016,positive,it didnt do justice to the original mainly because the humor was way off and they missed many important details it was much more cheesy chick flick humor than geeky horror comedy but overall it wasnt that bad it had its moments and it tried hard there were some great additions too like the detailed testing of all the equipment and toolswhich created a lot of future possibilities for the sequels but that being said there was a lot taken away that just boggled my mind as to why for example why did they only use a trap like once and the rest of the time they are just fighting the ghosts and beating them up with their proton streamswhich brings me to my next point not a single mention of not crossing the streams those were my biggest piss offs the cameos were great the story was alright and it was super fun kate mckinnen and chris hemsworth were amazing and it payed enough little homages to satisfy and warrant a sequelwhich i hope franchises into many different ghostbusters
Jul 25 2016,negative,okay so the first half of the movie had a  few lame parts but i didnt really think that the acting was that bad i was enjoying it the second half of the movie the wheels fell off and it went down the toilet did they just say screw it and gave up on the ending of the movie i have to say i was not expecting chris hemsworth to play that kind of role and i was rather amused by it i am a big melissa mccarthy fan and thought she did a great job it was nice to see so many cameos too i didnt grow up loving the original so i wasnt devastated by this remake but i just did not like it
Jul 25 2016,positive,really good movie i enjoyed with 12 yr old stepson different enough from original to stand on its own
Jul 25 2016,negative,i bit the bullet i went i saw and i died a little inside if this is your comedy preference then so be it but ive seen better story telling and pacing in adam sandler films and ive laughed more times watching schindlers list
Jul 25 2016,positive,it was the right twist between the orginal from 1984 and the modern day of today the movie was just enought to entertain and the jokes were so so overall ghostbusters was good mabey could have been better if more time was spent into the main plot ill give it a fair 3 stars
Jul 25 2016,negative,i gave the film a chance  i put aside preconceived notions but this was really a stinker of a movie  the characters are pretty much the same characters weve seen them play before  the bad guy was just horribly conceived and executed  one thing of note whatever happened to catching ghosts  they started on that path with the trap and then magically the proton packs became shotguns capable of destroying ghosts
Jul 25 2016,positive,the trailers for this movie does not do it justice though most of the trailer jokes are in the movie that shouldnt stop you from seeing the film
Jul 25 2016,negative,only went to see it because someone else paid  i still want my money back
Jul 25 2016,negative,forced to see this as  startrek was sold out another hollywood remake that runs short of the original only hope this movie has is the 5 bin at walmart  only good experience from the waste of my life spent watching this was the free vouchers  to another movie given to us for the discriptive video not working
Jul 25 2016,positive,hollywood is always been obsessed with the idea of remaking repackage and reinterpret a film histories that been told by a filmmaker been reimagine by other filmmaker with the intention of make money and appeal to new generations the experiment have worked and sometimes fail miserable creating a vortex of forgettable products films such as havana a remake or reinterpretation of casablanca oldboy adaptation of a successful korean film criminal a american version of a popular argentinean film is part of a long list but also there are remakes which includes planet of the apes conan the barbarian to name a few represents that collection of films that none wants to remember but on the other hand filmmakers like martin scorsese have been successful remaking cape fear and also reinterpret the chinese film internal affairs into the departed     the concept of telling stories is to express emotions empowering people making them dream the audience wants that its hard to remake and reinterpret a old film and make it successful but attempts keep going    paul feig decided to step in and reinterpret ghostbuster with a female cast proving that is possible only if youre able to get a good cast and also develop a good story that perhaps is not going to make forget the classic film from 1984 but help you understand that we are ready for a new generation of this ghost chasers     dr erin gillbert kristen wiig physics professor of columbia university is been approach by the grandson ed mulgrave ed begley of the owner of a mansion that seems to be hunted she seems skeptical because her early days she was involved in publication of a book that she and her co author abby yates melissa mccarthy about the study of the paranormal erin wants this book to be buried but later she discovered that the book still available after abby keep selling it as a source of money erin find that abby continues her studies for the paranormal along with dr killian holtzman kate mckinnon where they developing technologies to find and catch ghost erin seems to be interested in going back to that field after all of them have a real encounter in a hunted mulgrave mansion    the real treat of this new ghostbusters is the new cast which is presented with great chemistry in addition of leslie jones who is a scene stealer every time she appears the script wrote by paul feig and katie depplod quickly gather this four women and chris hemsworth as their secretary into a down and dirty ghost chase and energetic encounter with the unknown as well the main villain of the film    paul feig plays with nyc geography which for a real newyorker like me bothers me a lot you know where things are in ny but after you see the films annoys you his approach to the ghostbusters is fast which is the same problem that you see in other reboots of films you never take the time to breathe everything needs to be so quick seen the partial original cast as a cameo is fantastic and that feeds the frenzy of longtime fans    but unfortunately there is things that cannot be replace fall out boy song will never reach the level of ray parker jr ghostbusters as well the visual tone developed by ivan reitman of the original film is not there this new ghostbusters is colorful less scary but very funny
Jul 25 2016,negative,horrible casting horrible writing dead on arrival way to kill a franchise walked out most of the way through
Jul 25 2016,negative,this was a horrible movie and a complete waste of your money the special effects were awesome and so were the cameos the rest was utter crap the actresses were decidedly unfunny barring a few scenes with mccarthy this entire film was nothing more than an sjw feminist flop even going so far as to paint every single male in it as ineffectual idiots everyone this movie isnt bad because women star in movies everyday of every week its bad because it is unfunny and doesnt even attemp to hide its contempt for men
Jul 25 2016,positive,a remake that stands up to the original  very funny with a solid story and great dialogue
Jul 25 2016,negative,almost unwatchable great special effects not funny love the women involved but there was no chemistry chris hemsworth was the funniest character not worth the price of admission to see weak cameos by original ghostbusters and supporting cast
Jul 25 2016,negative,it sucked save your money couldnt believe how bad it was
Jul 25 2016,positive,started slow but got funnier after the characters were established good popcorn movie
Jul 25 2016,positive,i enjoyed it as much or more than the other ghost busters i was surprised because of the trailer the trailer wasnt nearly as good as the movie
Jul 25 2016,negative,movie stomps on anyones childhood  this movie is a failure and a sexism movement all guys in this movie are cowards dicks and idiots god damn it  why was this movie even brought into existence
Jul 25 2016,positive,funny and with great visuals thought the acting was on point as was the soundtrack
Jul 25 2016,positive,great addition to the franchise  it expaned on a world we already knew  new proton tech government interference and new members  i laughed the whole time im planning on seeing it again for the parts i missed while laughing  long live big dumb kevin
Jul 25 2016,positive,very funny and followed a good storyline
Jul 25 2016,positive,loved it really enjoyed all the nods to the original
Jul 25 2016,positive,great movie with several great messages woven throughout especially for younger girls  so nice to see a movie with females as the leads the ones who save a city and a man for that matter and smart and accomplished  it was a nice departure from the typical depiction of women who are the assistants eyecandy or the ones who need to be savedrescued  pretty clean too  easily could have taken kids to see it
Jul 25 2016,positive,better than the original go see it
Jul 25 2016,positive,its not a remake as much as its a separate film with similarities to the original with a great cast this is a film  i can stand by considering the bar the original set for me
Jul 25 2016,positive,much better than i thought it would be definitely a better movie than ghostbusters 2
Jul 25 2016,positive,i liked it better than i thought i would  leslie jones was pretty funny in the movie    yea  it could have been better and it was kinda hokie    my kid  loved it  and it was worth all of his time    so your kids are gonna love it  and  you might like it too   
Jul 25 2016,negative,ghostbusters 2016 review this may be the hardest review i may ever write i did not hate the film but i did not like it either first the positives the cast of this film for the most part were all good kristen wiig and melissa mccarthy have great chemistry and work well together leslie jones has some funny lines that had me busting a gut chris hemsworth also had some funny lines and great character development the look of the film is great bringing the franchise to a new generation i liked the story ideas that looked like they were headed into that direction but the execution left somewhat to be desired now the negatives kate mckinnon was the weak link of the new foursome i felt like she was trying too hard and too outlandish trying hard to be more akin to a female doc brown that just didnt work this film was trying to be a reboot and standalone film of the ghostbusters franchise when nothing needed to be rebooted in the first place the original 1984 classic ghostbusters and its sequel were perfect to begin with i feel a film franchise should only need a reboot if said franchise is in bad shape ie when director joel schummacher made the awful batman  robin 1997 the batman franchise was derailed and made into a laughing stock for almost a decade until director chris nolan gave us the dark knight trilogy 20052012 hence the saying if it aint broke dont fix it i suppose if youve never seen or heard of the originals one may enjoy this but purists and fans will look elsewhere for their entertainment and will be grabbing their torches  pitchforks i know this review is all over the place but so was the film i give this film a d dont forget to like andor leave a comment below
Jul 25 2016,negative,poor excuse of a leftist political statement
Jul 25 2016,positive,not the best ending but very funny and all the subtle things about how this has happened before people forget was really good
Jul 25 2016,positive,i loved it the girls were really funny specially kristen wiig and leslie jones was hilarious really fun movie to watch with funny ladies the special effects kinda made the movie look bad and i found kate mckinnon a little exaggerated but overall the movie was great and i laughs a lot
Jul 25 2016,negative,if this movie had been a sequel and had some jokes it would have been ok but it really had little substance or charm surely the point of a reboot is to improve or update the original    it is obviously not improved is it updated  not really it uses pretty much the same visual cues hearseambulancefirestationoverallsslimer and asides from having some interesting new weapons and gasp some women it really does nothing groundbreaking    this was an unwanted and unneeded reboot  many people claimed that it was hated because of sexism that may be true for a small part of the population but these same people just need to take a look at how the force awakens was well received with a female lead    if gb had been a sequel as tfa was then it could have been ok but it isnt its just going through the motions     one day somebody will learn that rebooting stuff is just lazy i was hoping that this would have happened after the wicker man remake but apparently not
Jul 25 2016,positive,hollywood should take note this is how you make a reboot ghostbusters pays homage to the original without resorting to telling the same exact story hopefully despite the haters who couldnt seem to get past the gender of the new team the movie enjoys enough success to get a sequel    this was a funny and entertaining film sure it wasnt as good as the original ghostbusters that was a special kind of awesome but it was better than ghostbusters 2 and a very solid movie in its own right
Jul 25 2016,negative,abysmal crap one of the worst movies ive ever seen even setting the original aside this film is a mess nonsensical plot zero humor confusing rules for the world its created thin characters generic city destruction that is in all action films these days and lazy vfx that appear to be left over from jamie foxxs electro in amazing spiderman 2 the films sole signature voice is that of the sony corporation and its four quadrant attempt to create a franchise for a movie studio fighting to stave off more layoffs
Jul 25 2016,positive,during the first 30 minutes i though my predictions about the trailer were correct however it really does pick up when they start kicking in the action the humor is terrible but i must say not bad chris hemsworth and kate mckinnon are holarious go out and watch it if you get the chance
Jul 25 2016,negative,this movie is the reason they need try before you buy in theatres
Jul 25 2016,negative,too violent and way too much talking  cast members interaction is mundane
Jul 25 2016,negative,the only thing i liked about this were the cameos by some of the original cast absolutely rubbish hope it loses money
Jul 25 2016,positive,i thought this movie was very good and cute and funny the four ghostbusters were girls instead of guys i loved how it was base in new york city ny  i loved how they had some of the same characters from the old ghostbusters movies too i loved the whole movie too it was the best summer movie every
Jul 25 2016,negative,a complete waste of time and who ever wrote the screenplay for that movie should never work in hollywood again  the movie had so much potential but most of the audience was left bitterly disappointed
Jul 25 2016,positive,far better than the critics are saying written by dan aykroyd harold ramis and rick moranis uncredited
Jul 25 2016,positive,my kids  i loved itand my 10  12 yr old are serious critics  much like the original ghostbusters its full of laughs
Jul 25 2016,positive,despite all the bad reviews and comments this movie stands on its own merit unfortunately the characters were not written with the actresses zany personalities in mind and are slightly cardboard otherwise a great movie
Jul 25 2016,negative,unless youre a 9 year old boy or a really simple minded adult  it was a total waste of time terrible writing terrible directing terrible acting  but my nine year old son thought it was hilarious hence the half star any legit critic giving this thing any credence at all is being paid off by the studio  there is no other explanation in my opinion
Jul 25 2016,positive,nice addition to the franchise  and yes i realize its not a sequel but a terrific standalone piece of entertainment with a nod to the original and a new story  enjoy 
Jul 25 2016,negative,holy moly this was probably the worst thing ive ever seen im not a fan of poop and fart jokes because im not an adolescent this movie doesnt have jokes or gags just lowiq garbagesave your money i wish i had
Jul 25 2016,positive,such a fun movie im not a fan of remaking classics but i thought they did a nice job of not copying the original but giving it a whole new story with some nods to the original films and cartoon i wasnt sure how i would feel about it but i went and saw it and i loved it fun film
Jul 25 2016,negative,right now its critics and feminists vs fans of the original movie but ill just say that this is one of the most disappointing reboots of all time when i watched the movie no one was laughing at it how can people find this good and funny its just sad and stupid
Jul 25 2016,positive,as a die hard ghostbusters fan i was quite skeptical going into the theatre i was pleasantly suprise by the movie there was plenty of comedy excellent cgi not too shabby action and a decent story line  dont listen to all of the hatred around this movie i woke up this morning without my childhood ruined
Jul 25 2016,negative,id rather eat stale popcorn then have to see this just another studio cash grab
Jul 25 2016,negative,movie was horrible i got up and walked out after being 1 hour into the movie knowing the movie is 1hr and 45 min long and there was nothing interesting happening no action not even funny considering there were some funny actresses in it i knew i wasnt going to miss anything after that it was a waste of money and i was very disappointed the trailerpreviews was created to appear to be goodif you really want to see this just wait till it comes out or watch it on the firestick not worth a movie ticket
Jul 25 2016,negative,not even going to watch it original is the best
Jul 25 2016,negative,dont even bother with 73 tomatometer  this movie should not exist  this movie is an snl skit  this movie does not respect the license and original title  this is a shameless cashin  310
Jul 25 2016,negative,you guys are flat out lying in your review of it being decent  it was god awful painful to watch and insulting to its source material shame on you rotten tomatoes
Jul 25 2016,positive,to be honest there are some flat jokes in this film but this film is still enjoyable well some fans might hate me but i will say this i like this film as much as i like the original
Jul 25 2016,positive,this is a perfectly serviceable summer popcorn movie like any sequel it doesnt have the originality of the original but there was a good mix of homage and new twists technology and characters overall there is more overt humor than the original most of which lands very well the cameos from the original cast are there without being overdone and the new cast gels well as for the twitter trolls and even the reviews with an agenda hereignore them
Jul 25 2016,positive,so much fun moments of real feels and the best wacky character since depps captain jack sparrow
Jul 25 2016,positive,its was pretty epic
Jul 25 2016,negative,omg what did i just watch i would have given it 3 stars  if it wasnt named ghost busters the movie should be named ghost chasers instead the problem is for those people who loved the old movie they get rather confused when they see this movie as there is not continuity or reason for this movie i would say the actors are all incredibly talented the script and directing is just horrible whoever directed this movie should be kicked off the franchise and the writer should be removed as well p
Jul 25 2016,negative,whoever gave this so called movie high rates had ability not to sleep throughout boring totally unfunny 2 hours
Jul 25 2016,positive,i saw this movie was a bit nervous  at first i love the ghost busters  movies this one did not disappoint my daughter loved it and i enjoyed it a great mix of adult humor and child wonder for the whole family
Jul 25 2016,positive,great movie very funny and plot mostly makes sense   this is at least on par if not better than the original ghostbuster and definitely better than ghostbusters 2
Jul 25 2016,positive,of course it doesnt come close to the original but as a stand alone movie it was fantastic it didnt feel forced or like it was leaning to much on the original the cameos were great too exceeded expectation if youre thinkimg about not seeing this movie think again
Jul 24 2016,negative,unfortunately i found this movie very predictable and unenjoyable the comedy just missed the mark for me im disappointed i love the actors and think they could have done so much more with the franchise the pacing seemed off and no doubt there will be an extended edition what happened to catching ghosts it was just mindless slaying cg ghosts which for some reason are balloons the cameos were just weird damn i really wanted this to be good
Jul 24 2016,negative,what a horrible movie
Jul 24 2016,negative,just a poorly made movie in my opinion
Jul 24 2016,positive,about as good as a reboot could be i actually would have liked to see the reins loosened a bit on the story line to take full advantage of the funny women they were lucky enough to get but there were some genuinely funny moments overall very enjoyable
Jul 24 2016,positive,i saw this last night and to be honest it wasnt that bad i really like the effects but the some of the jokes were a little overdone its an enjoyable movie just like the first two its kind of a mixture of the original 2 movies and the animated series extreme ghostbusters
Jul 24 2016,neutral,while its not as terrible as it was built up to be and the casting does have comedic potential if they were given a better script but the movie unfortunately fails at trying to deliver a focused narrative with clever comedy not the worst movie ever but i do know that if theres something strange in the neighborhood im sadly not calling any of these people
Jul 24 2016,positive,i thought it was great movie i like how it wasnt trying to be the orginal movie and just did there own thing  the cast was so funny and the cameos were perfect it was a fun movie
Jul 24 2016,neutral,first half hour was good the rest was ok
Jul 24 2016,positive,a good afternoon of fun and escapism
Jul 24 2016,neutral,i really really wanted to like this movie i had no issue with an allfemale ghostbusters given the talented cast and a director with an impressive track record in femaleled comedies but this just did not work what a shame
Jul 24 2016,negative,not the worst movie ever but extremely mediocre
Jul 24 2016,positive,very entertaining with lots of laughs great movie for the whole family to enjoy
Jul 24 2016,positive,this movie is much better than its trailer made it seem  its just too bad there was so much controversy surrounding what is a pretty lighthearted homage to the original movie  theres nothing terribly creative or inventive here but its still fun  there are some good jokes and some good special effects  nothing to complain about  there have been worse movies this year
Jul 24 2016,positive,loved it melissa mccarthy is the best
Jul 24 2016,positive,my wife and i loved it we are huge fans of the original films while there are similarities since it is based on the same concept it really is its own unique film well acted funny outstanding graphics scary ghosts the rather crowded theater applauded at the end make sure to stay until the absolute end of all of the credits there is good content all the way to the end i would pay to see it again and will likely buy the bluray when it comes out
Jul 24 2016,positive,really good funny movie glad they didnt just remake an old one and just started fresh
Jul 24 2016,positive,i loved this movie and the characters in it it was very funny to watch and i did not get bored through the movie i definatly recommend this
Jul 24 2016,positive,absolutely delightful my husband and i laughter ourselves to tears
Jul 24 2016,positive,funny nostalgic lots of fun  cheesy  yesbut its ghostbusters
Jul 24 2016,positive,such a great movie so fun to see ghostbusters with the new special effects technology kate mckinnon was especially funny
Jul 24 2016,negative,with an incoherent plot and a bunch of scenes that look like they are just thrown in this makes ghostbusters 2 1989 look like a masterpiece  the editing and direction of the film seem like this film was rushed to get in to theaters on the plus side director paul feig manages to keep mccarthy in line and not whining too much kristin wiig does her best and manages to keep everything held together
Jul 24 2016,positive,the movie has very undeserved bad ratings mostly misogynist or racist based but the movie is very good a good successor of the originals and has a new feeling and humor to make a standing for it self hoping to see more of this
Jul 24 2016,positive,the movie has some questionable parts but not that bad for a reboot the effects are truly stunning  im a fan of the original ghostbuster myself and seeing this movie was a fresh take on the original one as that is what it is a whole new take on the ghostbuster i did like this movie and think its a great movie to watch as long as you have an open mind when watching it and not think too much about the originals
Jul 24 2016,positive,very funny quite engaging may be scary for kids so if youre thinking of taking young children you may reconsider
Jul 24 2016,positive,way better than it should have been  scene after the credits that sets up the sequel
Jul 24 2016,positive,pleasantly surprised with the reboot of ghiostbusters everything was well done but hated the updated theme song
Jul 24 2016,positive,saw ghostbusters today i enjoyed it its certainly not as good as the original and thats not just nostalgia talking hard to capture the freewheeling chemistry that the original four had that being said kate mckinnon was surprisingly the standout here as her character was offbeat and funny leslie jones was good if you enjoy her usual schtick and i do wiig was decent in a somewhat understated role and mccarthy was her usual enjoyable self really enjoyed chris hemsworths himbo routine as their male secretary as well the cameos were kind of fun i suppose although i still think they should have connected this one to the originals by having mccarthys character be rays niece or something who improves on the original equipment with the help of the other ladies special effects were well done as with any reboot there has to be the obligatory shout outs to the original and most of those were enjoyable though a couple of them were eyerolling so i enjoyed it but i dont see watching this one again and again as i do the original sorry ladies rt 3 12  5 imdb 710
Jul 24 2016,positive,funny great special effects good reboot
Jul 24 2016,positive,the new ghostbusters is surprisingly funny at times charming and has a personality its a shame that its not nearly as fleshed out as it could be and that some of the jokes fall flat its a good family film not great by any means but way better than it has any reason to be
Jul 24 2016,negative,worst movie i have ever seen i grew up on the original ghostbusters and this completely ruins the ip it has nothing to do with all female cast the acting was  horrible the jokes were not funny and the script was atrocious
Jul 24 2016,negative,nonsensical  the message here is  women are stronger than men and men are useless idiots  no deeper meaning like in the previoius movies  not funny at all because the script is sooooo  bad  not even the amazing kirsten wiig kate mckinnon chris hemsworth and charles dance can save this ideological trainwreck of a movie
Jul 24 2016,negative,what it lacks in originality it makes up for in banality
Jul 24 2016,positive,when they put on their uniforms im not going to lie i teared up a little it was as if my childhood dreams of becoming a ghostbuster was finally coming true the movie was also really funny my only complaint was i wish they were fighting a god instead of just a man like in the originals i feel as though the true meaning of ghostbusters was lost on the writers in that sense but i still loved it want to watch it again and will be buying it when it come out
Jul 24 2016,positive,i dont understand the negative reviews i thought the movie was very funny and well done i laughed all the way through enjoyed the cameos as well i loved the original as well and recall it not getting very good reviews either i guess it is one of those love it or hate it movies i loved it
Jul 24 2016,positive,liked the movie although cant beat the original
Jul 24 2016,positive,part of this rating stems from the fact that the type of humor and the general stylegenre of this movie is very similar to that of the original scoobydoo show which was my favorite show from ages 315ish but most of this is the fact that its just a really good movie that had the spirit of the original reimagined in a fresh and modern way each comedian did an amazing job brining humor to their role the special effects had a little horror and gore without being hyperralistic or too nightmarish and the story while a little predictable was fun and spooky
Jul 24 2016,negative,this movie was absolutely terrible  i was expecting so much because of the cast but it wasnt funny at all 1010 would not recommend
Jul 24 2016,positive,the trailers doesnt do it justice at all wonderful cast for the main characters smart characters with tangible personalities and background granted the male secretary is more mentally deficient than stupid and its just bad taste to laugh at mentally retarded people on this point they pushed it a bit far but what was at least nice about it is that the girls included him despite his mental retardation as a member of their team  good special effects good build up through the movie of a few running gags   i would not call this movie a remake its more a eulogy to the original with many winks at the original ghostbusters through the movie  of course there were many girl jokes that some guys might not get like where the fart came from but despite the strong female presence i wouldnt call this a feminist movie its just a movie with more girls than guys for a change period  and it feels good for once that a movie with female casts does not feature skinny girls with tits but women with character
Jul 24 2016,negative,a few bright moments aside this is largely terrible i went in with honest hopes i wasnt a critical of the reboot in fact i was really looking forward to it but ultimately this is a let down it has nothing in keeping with the predecessors and is full of plot holes odd decisions dialogue that falls flat characters that grate effects that leave you feeling nothing a big disappointment
Jul 24 2016,positive,i dont know who is reviewing this movie  but it was so fun clearly we arent expecting an academypleasing performance in a summer action comedy definitely worth the money to see it in theatres its a feelgood flick and chris hemsworth does a great job as a male taking on a stereotypically female role he was certainly up for the challenge
Jul 24 2016,positive,loved this movie actually thinking about getting it once the dvd is released
Jul 24 2016,negative,it was a bad idea from the start a cash grab most of the fans of the original didnt want it and those who werent fans most likely didnt care i understand there was also an online backlash from casting differently than a white male but it didnt really sway me from my views i gave it a fair shot at the end of the day it isnt so much bad as it was mediocre a flash in the pan that i will most likely never rewatch a movie that will most likely be forgotten in time but it wasnt made for me and thats fine when someone does a sequel or remake of a thing i love i just say jaws had 3 shitty sequels and jaws is still awesome it also didnt ruin my childhood my only hope is that maybe it did some good by speaking to a new generation of younger geeky moviegoers    oh i was talking about the karate kid starring jaden smith but yes also the same for this movie
Jul 24 2016,positive,for months ive been hearing about how terrible this movie was going to be i assumed the worst when i went it just because of all the bad press relating to how this was all about feminism and how this remake was going to ruin ghostbusters well if you havent noticed theyve remade about every other movie in the past fifty years so whats the big whoop about this one ridiculousness i guess this movie didnt live up to its terrible hype turns out it was actually pretty good and worth watching i laughed and enjoyed myself throughly also chris hemsworth was surprising funny he reminds me of jermaine from flight of the concord and looks amazing in a white t shirt and jeans everyone was great recommend it to anyone who wants to see a fun movie
Jul 24 2016,negative,just didnt do anything for me or my family  kids 21 and 17 who are fans of the first movie werent impressed either  we were basically laughing at it rather than with it because it was such a poor copy of the original poor acting poor plot poor characters
Jul 24 2016,positive,its a fun summer blockbuster just take it as it is eat some popcorn enjoy yourself
Jul 24 2016,positive,my family really liked it i debated to take our 85 year old and the first opening scene is definitely the darkestscariest part of the movie and got my eleven year olds attention right a way but turned out to be a pretty good movie the whole family could enjoy i didnt know it my 85 year had snuck in for the last 25 minutes or so after her animated feature w grandma got out before ours and now she is anxious to see the whole movie    i wouldnt compare the past ghostbusters movies its definitely a different audience this one was not scary at all no sexual innuendo or really anything inappropriate other than middle finger scene and there were at least 5 cameos from the other ghostbuster movies and at least one had a producers credit it was a worthy reboot
Jul 24 2016,positive,my family enjoyed that it felt worthy of being a ghost buster movie it had humor of course slime  ghosts and the original ghostbusters gang showed up in movie and in end credits which i was really excited to see the ghost buster originals x10
Jul 24 2016,positive,so much better than the original in my opinion
Jul 24 2016,negative,terrible the jokes just are not funny 73 on tomatometer i thought i could trust it but now i will be much more cautious ok ok special effects were good
Jul 24 2016,positive,pleasantly surprised looking forward to the next one
Jul 24 2016,positive,this movie is fun and badass finally a movie where women do their thing are good to each other dont talk about men all the time or ever are smart dont have their boobs hanging out and they kick butt go see it youll have a great time
Jul 24 2016,neutral,from the start ive never had a issue with the cast the issue here is rebooting the franchise over use of cgi and gadgets which overall took too much away from story  cast did great with what they had to work with the problem is poor writing and crappy direction  kids will like it but based on the opinions people expressed that were actually at the theatre this as a disappointment  and i agree it was a disappointment
Jul 24 2016,positive,omg this movie is so funny i loved it  i had great special effects and at one point it was hard to breath i was laughing so hard
Jul 24 2016,positive,a really  funny movie  better than expected
Jul 24 2016,positive,let me start off by saying this is my opinion im entitled to it respect mine ill respect yours i loved the original ghostbusters film it was one of my favorite movies growing up so when i heard they were remaking it i was skeptical not because they were all women but because ghostbusters is a classic going in i was preparing myself for a flop but oh my god was i wrong i loved it every minute of it from the characters to the nostalgic nods to the original to the stellar casting and the story i loved it im probably going to see it again honestly so if everyone can kindly stop letting misogyny and their own egos get in there way and go see the movie i promise you wont be disappointed
Jul 24 2016,positive,very funny and entertaining
Jul 24 2016,positive,i was a teenager when the original came out so i was prepared to find this version inferior to the first  i actually found it to be pretty funny  i enjoyed it  in my mind it didnt quite live up to the original so i talked my daughter into watching the original  nostalgia plays a big role in how we remember the original  she thought it was it was teri le and i had to admit in comparison the new one was betterterrible
Jul 24 2016,negative,this movie was horrible i didnt like the flow of the movie to include the character development and it didnt make me laugh i dont know about you but hearing women make jokes about farting from the front doesnt make me laugh it makes me cringe do yourself a favor and dont give this movie your time or money
Jul 24 2016,negative,sucks dont waste your money
Jul 24 2016,positive,i enjoyed this movie it was funny if a bit sophomoric it made reference to the original but it was its own movie i would recommend giving the movie a chance
Jul 24 2016,negative,terrible movie with  jokes that fall flat wonderful women who were delt a bad script and a lot of man hate that everyone thinks its okay due to youtube   sony deleted legit critisim that all men and women supported comments and left only women hating comments on their trailer to make it seem like all men represented this point of view   this movie shouldnt be supported just because theyre women if thats the case then jem and the holograms should have been too but it had a terrible trailer and no one women or men supported it at all wheres the out cry with that looks like a double standard to me
Jul 24 2016,positive,hilarious and great action sequences
Jul 24 2016,negative,dont waste your money this movie is trash just take the money you would have paided and burn it that is how bad it is
Jul 24 2016,positive,it is so refreshing to see female leads be badass without having to be sexy or relying on a man at the same time i need more movies in my life that feature female leads kicking ass in shapeless jumpsuits 3
Jul 24 2016,negative,i am superfeminist this was still not great i have seen melissa mccarthy and kristen wiig be much funnier even on tv the entire project reeked of fear it was as if scriptwriter and director were so afraid of besmirching the original that everyone just took the energy down about six levels also whoever edited this movie lingered about to beats too long after every joke it just made the whole thing fall flat too bad because the casts mix of energy and subtlety could have been really fun to watch
Jul 24 2016,negative,the problem with this film isnt the cast being all women its the film being little more than yet another extended failed snl sketch    the reaction from the actresses and director to the criticisms though just made everything even more pathetic    let this film burn in cinema hell and never be remembered
Jul 24 2016,positive,actually surprised that i liked it  not the same as the original  which is why i think it worked  d
Jul 24 2016,positive,fantastic the original is one of my favorite movie and the new ghostbusters kicked ass a must see
Jul 24 2016,negative,i cannot begin to tell you how much i hated this movie if you laughed in the trailers you will find this movie just mediocre but if you dont find dumb people and quiff jokes funny you will like this film as much as i did
Jul 24 2016,positive,this is my new favorite movie it is smart and funny it is fantastic
Jul 24 2016,positive,it was excellent  movie honored originals and harold ramis would be very proud all cameos and new cast is fabulous stay till very end loved the credits and tributes much better than i thought it was a super fun laugh out loud summer flick
Jul 24 2016,positive,wed give it an okay ghosts were pretty well done but acting by the current snl gals was not the greatest ill guessing that will change with some more rolls under their belts
Jul 24 2016,negative,did anyone responsible for making this film actually watch it there were so many completely unfunny lines pointless characters and plain dullness i nearly left the theater kate mckinnon was especially pointless at one point when a restaurants steam tables were strangely in the road she said this looks like my kitchen was that supposed to be funny it just went on and on like that unfunny pointless lines there were a lot of continuity problems too  at one point they go to look up something on the internet and the page theyre looking for is already pulled up the light on the glasses go on and off it just felt slapped together
Jul 24 2016,positive,this was really funny and fun to watch my whole family enjoyed it
Jul 24 2016,positive,very fun movie with a great new cast needed a stronger script so hopefully these women get a chance to make an even better movie next time
Jul 24 2016,positive,hilarious i laughed so hard it had the right amount of nostalgia from the originals and fun additions stay to the end of the credits for a bonus scene
Jul 24 2016,positive,if you watch with an open mind without an aim to compare then its a watchable movie you can actually enjoy it
Jul 24 2016,negative,well leslie jones was  the highlight she had the beat lines and best performance by far melissa mccarthy and the rest clearly tried their best with a sub par script i like these actresses but their talent was wasted here  although it did have a good joke about internet haters    the new ghost gadgets were pretty bad ghost chipper wtf but the worst was hemsworths portrayel a profoundly mentally handicapped man who was oddly objectified the whole movie that is not a figure of speech he literally acts as if he has severe brain damage and is fawned over    the thing i remember the most was the villain a little fat guy who began with waitresses finding him so uncool they refused to wait on him it progressed to the stars insulting him for being a virgin and eventually shooting him in the crotch     his motivation read like a school shooting manifesto from a very bullied young man however we are expected to cheer for the women who bullied him thats not feminism that is the plot of mean girls with a disgusting columbine style twist anyone who would justify virgin shaming is a bad person period    i had such high hopes for this movie a moral of girls can do science would be great sadly the moral of this story was sexualize men with the iq of a 2 year old bully men who are bullied and leslie jones needs  her  own movie because she is a really good actress
Jul 24 2016,positive,it wasnt as good as the original ghostbusters but it had its funny moments i enjoyed it i laughed through most of it
Jul 24 2016,negative,i found it to be tediously long  not very funny and sadly   an unimaginative redo of the much better original
Jul 24 2016,positive,really bad directing wastes an incredible cast disappointing cdw
Jul 24 2016,negative,meh good for a couple laughs but really made me just wanna watch the original
Jul 24 2016,negative,this space left blank
Jul 24 2016,positive,loved it something to escape reality people need to learn how to stop taking things so damn serious and enjoy the moment if you do that then youll enjoy the movie
Jul 24 2016,positive,not a perfect film by any means but highly enjoyable nonetheless its not inyourface feminist propaganda despite the assertions of many an internet crybaby
Jul 24 2016,positive,as a reboot its actually a really solid homage to the original which is why im giving it 45 if it were a standalone id probably drop that to 3 or 355 it was fun goofy and dry just like the first film not a ton of laugh out loud moments but a fair number of internal chuckles or giggles considering that there are so many godawful remakes out there these days this one stands up pretty well
Jul 24 2016,neutral,i had a good time with this new version of ghostbusters specially in the hemsworth scenes and mccarthy lines she is really talented gifted for comedy the other protagonists are kind of filler mainly mckinnon but a good cast the film its somehow similar to the first one even on the pace but i think that was the ideia if so it pales in comparision i didnt like the constant cameos that was to much  even ozzy and the lines related to the 80s flick  kind of kills this one but nevertheless albeit some exagereted special effects the movie its kind of funny and you can have a good time with it
Jul 24 2016,positive,its not perfect id like to see pattys role expanded and her character made more intrinsic for example a few jokes could have been written with more finesse yes there are a few awkward patches but overall the joy of seeing a movie with four women heroes is real yall and its sad i had to wait 40 years to see it smart ladies kick ass ladies not just girlfriends not just supermodels in distress the special effects were great the camaraderie is great the actresses are great the movie is a summer blockbuster meant to be fun and it is fun whats happening to leslie jones on twitter is a travesty there are also a lot of butthurt manchildren out there who feel like the other 999999 of movies out there with all male heroes are not enough for them the actual stars of the first ghostbusters loved this reboot and my son and i did too our theater erupted in applause at the end
Jul 24 2016,positive,with so many opposing views on this film and so much politicising and controversy i tried bot to expect too muchand make my mind up in conclusion it was neither terrible nor great       everything about the film seemed to be hitandmiss the plot had good elementsbut then seemed to fall flatand rush to the ending i didnt find the characters of hultzmann and kevin were a bit silly and pointless at times i didnt see the point of having kevin in the film       the humour offered some good momentsbut then some of the jokes seemed forced and predictable the film was trying too hard to be hilariousand in my opinion failed by some chance      the cgi and effects were now like an animation instead of reallife effects the effects in the original from 1984 were actually more impressive      all in all the film was ok i can see why some would like itand why some wouldnt because it does have some good partsbut it highly flawed it was on the level of ghost busters 2and wdidnt come close to ghost busters the original if there is a follow up to this new format id see it again but more for curiosity than on the merit of the current film
Jul 24 2016,positive,i was prepared to hate it only going to see it because our daughters wanted to  glad i saw it  keep an open mind and dont compare to original and enjoy the movie for what it is
Jul 24 2016,negative,there are a handful of jokes in this movie but on the whole its actually kindof boring with pedestrian action sequences the cast is ok but they often seem to be going through the motions
Jul 24 2016,positive,this should not work but somehow it totally did     it borrows from the original and there are references and one liners and other things that hark back to it    well written good character acting and good fun enjoyable
Jul 24 2016,positive,very funny kate mckinnon steals every scene that shes in but the entire main cast is strong nearly all of the jokes landed well in the theater i saw it in sfx were good dont believe the negative hype by people too upset by the premise to even see the movie
Jul 24 2016,positive,a hilarious film with a great cast a fun new installment in this franchise that adds so much and also features some great shout outs to the first film
Jul 24 2016,positive,what a fun funny movie great for the whole family dont be a hater go be a kid again enjoy the movie who ya going to call
Jul 24 2016,negative,if i could give negative stars i would entire movie felt forced did not legitimately laugh once absolutely horrible
Jul 24 2016,neutral,ok  so i came into this film with low expectations  i thought it was gonna be a mess   i came out surprised it was actually entertaining and funny at points  the cast of women worked and the cameo appearances made me smile   there is no point in trying to explain the plot im pretty sure everyone will guess it   even the mayor in the movie would deny knowledge of the plot but he knows what is going on  yea thats a hint indeed it was corny in places and i wish more effort would have been put forth to bring back this series in more epic fashion  i suppose having low expectations allowed me to let down my guard and just be entertained  and coming in without the baggage allowed me to relax and enjoy it
Jul 24 2016,negative,just lame i wanted it to be horrifically bad but it failed at even that  a few absurd lol moments mostly from mckinnon but the rest of the cast just sucks and falls flat  thors part is just utterly idiotic and not in any manner of endearing way  the story is lame and most of the action just looks stupid  nerdy brainy broads are badarsed in a gunfight  nope  not buying it      nothing about this movie works except for mckinnon  and shes just weird more than funny    and all of the cameos of the original cast are lame  not one made me laugh  how pathetic is that  155  skip it
Jul 24 2016,neutral,it was ok but it will never be the original ghostbusters  the 2nd i think it better than this  there were some funny parts  leisure jones was to me the only funny one  like the original dan and harold real thought the mythology of the bad guy where this movie didnt give a crap  melissa mccarthy is better than this i thought the boss was funnier than this  if they do the sequel please have dan ackroyd write the script
Jul 24 2016,positive,lots of fun with an original storyline but great callbacks to the original movies especially if you stay til the aftercredits scene hint hint did anyone else spot the harold ramis easter egg early on i thought that was perfect
Jul 24 2016,positive,just watch it okay  now sure it isnt beating the original or anything not even close but no doubt it still is a funny light headed movie while i was in the theatre every time some joke happened the audience started cracking up i remember this guy a few seats away from me was falling on the floor with laughter i laughed too   the only problem i had with the movie is that it didnt bring enough new things to the table and changing the gender of the ghostbusters is not bringing new things to the table they really had the same formula as the first bit with a few changes  though the girls were great ghostbusters no matter what anyone says greatly cast  so yea if your expecting it to be better than the first one dont get your hopes up though if your looking for a movie that you will laugh at and enjoy just watch it okay  stop saying its gonna suck har har har and just watch it 
Jul 24 2016,positive,adorable remake loved all the cameos and how they move the story to a new direction whole family loved it
Jul 24 2016,positive,loved the movie its a fun light hearted movie that reminds me why i love ghostbusters  
Jul 24 2016,positive,this movie is not going to win any awards but i really enjoyed it  it kept the original charm of the first films of this franchise  it has some of my favorite ladies and some awesome cameos spoiler alert slimer has not aged a bit 
Jul 24 2016,positive,i really enjoyed it  i thought they did a great job of balancing respect for the original movies with doing something fresh and new  i love the cast  they have great chemistry and were a lot of fun  hopefully if there is a sequel well see more of kate mckinnon  it seemed like shots with her were sometimes aggressively edited so your attention would stay on mccarthy and wiig  thats a small complaint though  a lot of people criticized this film before it ever came out  thats their loss because this move was a lot of fun
Jul 24 2016,positive,good easygoing film with quite a few laughs the casting was excellent and kate mckinnon takes the cake here   it was a decent homage to the classic 80s film much more enjoyable than ghostbusters 2
Jul 24 2016,negative,so very instulting the lack ofwell everything but a budget is apparent feels like they wrote this script in a day and who are these jokes aimed at i am not sure what this is supposed to beso very bad i love their snl presence on snli dont know why they didnt  jut make this a 5 minute skit would of made them more money
Jul 24 2016,positive,i thought this movie was hilarious and fun all around it was amazing to see a cast of women fighting ghosts and being completely badass while still wearing clothes im grateful for a film like this a film that shows little girls and boys that we too can kick ass and that we are more than just a sex symbol while all of these women are beautiful it isnt about their looks but about their strength
Jul 24 2016,negative,the worst movie of the year so bad did not laugh once the girls in the movie did the best they could with such horrible writing and blahhh story
Jul 24 2016,positive,not as bad as people have made it out to be  its not a great movie its got way too much potty humor the jokes are too rapid fire and it really needs to learn to shut up at times  but the characters are wellestablished the story flows very well especially for a somewhat short movie and the effects arent as bad as people have said  if you arent firmly attached to the films of the past you should be able to enjoy this one as the start of a new story and universe
Jul 24 2016,positive,it lost a star and a half bc of the chris hemsworth scenes he took away from the movie but everything else was funny kids and adults laughed overall a fun movie
Jul 24 2016,neutral,i liked how this movie is trying to promote female main characters i also like the action but the main part of all ghostbusters movies the jokes were bad besides kevin the secretary nobody in the movie was consistently funny you should see this movie but there is no rush
Jul 24 2016,positive,very funny   i really enjoyed all the action and even though the story wasnt hugely complex it was good enough for the ladies to build around i do wish i got a little more leslie jones and kate mckinnon but i loved the new ghostbusters chemistry
Jul 24 2016,negative,wanted to leave half way through there were a few mildly funny scenes but for the most part this movie was a total flop
Jul 24 2016,positive,an instant classic outstanding great humor great character moments solid action kate mckinnon is now officially on the scene as a big screen personality all around win
Jul 24 2016,negative,worst ever and im a big fan of actors snl but simply a poor remake would rather watch the original again
Jul 24 2016,positive,went to see this with 12 year old and 9 yr old  we all loved it really funny and jumpscary but nothing traumatising we laughed a lot and hope they make a sequel  better than the original maybe
Jul 24 2016,positive,very impressive graphics decent plot and a lot of selfaware humor with cameos from the original makes this movie worth it to see    although there were a few wasted opportunities with the plot and some of the motivations for characters was flimsy absolutely no effort was wasted on having the ghostbusters do what we always dreamed of as children kicking ghoul butt and looking cool while doing it
Jul 24 2016,negative,is not the liveaction sequel that we a waiting since 1989 that is a big fail
Jul 24 2016,negative,very disappointing beyond bad and melissa mccarthy i dont know how she is making movies
Jul 24 2016,negative,it was all right  a few laughs but a bit dull and too caught up in its distinctions not nearly as bad as some have said but not very good either might be better to wait for netflix
Jul 24 2016,positive,cant compare to the first i think chris hemsworth stole the show  the graphics were excellent i wont see it again
Jul 24 2016,positive,in an of itself not a bad popcorn flick it lacks the classic magic of the ghostbusters i  ii and chris hemsworths kevin is annoyingly stupid but it isnt anywhere near as bad as i expected based on the trailers while borrowing primarily form the first film it has a lot of the classic plot points that define a ghostbusters movie an innocent person encountering a ghost in the intro getting fired from stuffy old columbia university independent investigation of the ghost problem a trip to visit the mayor tearing up an expensive location something giant walking through the streets incompetent government agents and so on if anything it feels too polished if you can accept that it is a reboot and not a continuation its not a bad flick honestly tough they should have written in some star trekstyle continuity device to link the two universes and shut everybody up and the women theyre mostly unique characters with some derivative influences from the classic team patty is a lot more intelligent and thoughtful than the trailers made her out to be gilbert is a bookish standalone character holtzmann is a sort of quirky venkman on stimulantsegon fusion yates is most similar to stantz the cameos were all well placed and most characters got in a oneliner that throws back to the original but i wish theyd have kept the character names the same would have been an interesting concept as an alternate universe where the original ghostbusters never came together but who still retained their original identities a lot of the hate against this film has been attributed to misogyny and undoubtedly there is some of that but the trailers were just bad the film itself is much better than the trailers made it out to be though it is also far from perfect the lack of continuity is a bothersome decision but it is clear that this is a different universe so whatever this isnt a girl power type movie it is a movie where the ghostbusters happen to be female if theres any lesson there its that the essence of being a ghostbuster is unrelated to biological sex the style of the special effects the street battles and the ghostbusters working for the city reminded me of the 2009 video game which dan aykroyd previously said was essentially ghostbusters 3 in an interactive form not a bad summer movie overall and i fell like it will become lesshated with time and endless reruns
Jul 24 2016,positive,funny movie and kate definitely stole the show  i also liked the cameos from characters from previous movies  chris was a plus
Jul 24 2016,positive,i saw the original in the theater and loved it and was worried about this one because of the prerelease reviews but this one is actually better in many ways so much fun great pacing fun and well placed cameos and interesting characters  my only complaint is that the movie is too short  loved being able to take my preteen with me and see a cast of women kicking butt without all the misogynistic stuff that usually plagues movies  they were smart and funny and kickass
Jul 24 2016,positive,people need to give this movie a chance it was good
Jul 24 2016,neutral,neither busted nor ballsy ghostbusters 2016 was neither great nor terrible     there were some really funny parts some parts the make you groan but overall i thought it was fun i dont think any of the stars comedic talents really got to shine except for kate mckinnon and chris hemsworth it was less raunchy than the original and more goofy perhaps in an attempt to get families to see it i think id have preferred a bit more edge or scary scenes also by rebooting they had to rehash certain origin territory that couldve been better served by making it a sequel     i wouldve preferred feig and co make an original action comedy thats on the level of bridesmaids but its a competent summer flick
Jul 24 2016,positive,this movie was amazing it was funny and cheesy and actually scary i saw the originals but i dont remember them so maybe thats why i liked this one so much
Jul 24 2016,positive,very funny entertaining and uplifting do not underestimate the power of watching your own demographics doing super cool stuff on the big screen it put me into a great mood
Jul 24 2016,positive,ok it was ok it had its funny moments expected a different story line i felt it was too similar
Jul 24 2016,negative,these women thought they could fill the shoes of some important men i hope their careers fail and they turn to heroin and kill themselves i watched about 20 mins of the movie and got my money back worst movie ever this cast and director should go kill themselves or think about making a better movie watching this movie is like watching real housewives of ghostbusting not entertaining and full of brainmelting drama how do people live with themselves and moreover how do these bitches sleep at night i feel that this is a stain upon american culture and its apart of the lbgt agenda that the nwo is pushing hard
Jul 24 2016,positive,very fun take on an old classic dont go in expecting the original let it stand by itself and you wont be dissapointed the women are amazing the old crew was given homage with cameos which i hadnt expected and were really fun and even though patty was a bit of a stereotype and kevin was a little over the top i thoroughly enjoyed every character and every moment will absolutely watch again and buy this one when it comes out
Jul 24 2016,negative,the cackling ladies behind us seemed to be having a jolly good time
Jul 24 2016,positive,this movie was fun and funny kate mckinnon stole the show with her performance as jillian holtzman anyone who says they hated it probably didnt even both to watch it firstthe only thing that was awful was the ghostbusters cover song by fall out boy and normally like their music
Jul 24 2016,negative,was pretty disappointed
Jul 24 2016,positive,really  all that internet fuss over this reboot  now im an original ghost buster my daughter 13 is a new ghostbuster  the film is funny very funny has its scares has the witt of the original  and has me and mollly  fantastic     who you gonna call  sequel please
Jul 24 2016,neutral,so im going to keep this brief and informal as i have nothing new to say about the film that hasnt already been said its not a patch on the original but at the same time it isnt boring the changes they make from the original are reductive and redundant when theyre trying to be progressive and edgy the chemistry between the ghostbusters is alright but they are burdened by an overabundance of improvisation which break the believability in their actual characters the humour and jokes are surface level funny and are admittedly cheap and no way near as timeless as the gags from 1984 chris hemsworth is surprisingly funny and outshines the other stalwart comedic stars whenever he is on screen the cameos from the original ghostbusters are a mixed bag although dan aykroyds feature is by far the best and genuinely funny the visuals are impressive but the switch to near superhero blockbuster action towards the end is quite jarring but it must be said i saw this in a screening with kids all enjoying themselves gasping at the shocks and laughing at jokes so i feel this is a ghostbusters for a new age its just not my age meh i dunno watch it when it comes out on netflix or some shit and make your own minds up
Jul 24 2016,positive,even i was worried about this film but it turned out to be a really fun time and by the end i was wishing i could spend more time with the characters in the narrative on the down side t does feel repetitive in light of the previous plots and the balloon ghost characters felt out of place but utlimately the funny oneliners and chris hemsworths character bring a great deal of laughs and the new weapons are fun too its really interesting to note a meta layer of this film wherein the internet fanboy is actually cast as the villain
Jul 24 2016,positive,not impressed cheap copy of the original not even close  funny parts not in overall
Jul 24 2016,positive,ghostbusters is perfect proof that weak trailers and internet trolls should never be trusted feig and co have heard the vocal hordes of overreacting nostalgia nerds and straightup bigots and has decidedly ignored them except to call them out with a couple of decent metajokes placed within the film is the movie perfect or even great no its unnecessary selfawareness and lazy character writing make it feel too slapdash at times however its bundle of laughs and goodnatured scares keep it from being the childhoodruiner people assumed  for one thing it thankfully isnt the photocopy that the trailers promised sure it similarly follows some neerdowell scientists on a hapless adventure to capture ghosts otherwise much of its likeness is mostly found in its respectably oldfashioned structure and tone along with some fun disneyshauntedmansionesque fx and cartoonish practical sets feig used the passing of years to up the stakes in only the scares department ie awesomely scary mannequin segment and while i wish these new characters were more clearly defined than as just vehicles for plotting and humor that humor still shines throughout with a scenestealing turn by hemsworth as a prettyboy dope  the smaller comedic moments are what made the original film holdup for so many years and feig does his darndest to continue that style unfortunately some of that forced reverence is its biggest distraction leaving us questioning was this movie really necessary its packed to the gills with pointless cameos that offer nothing but annoyance and the final battle is a hasty and uninspired mess luckily the humor and cast make 2016s ghostbusters colorful pop entertainment thats at least outshines ghostbusters 2
Jul 24 2016,negative,poor acting on all the parts but patty who seemed the most genuine and enjoyable character of the movie most of the actors felt like they are just acting or didnt want to be there specialy the cameos the cuts dont make much sence as they seem to just move from one scene to another with hard cuts and no natural flow just because you can cut doesnt mean you should mst3k if i didnt riff this movie with my friends i couldnt sit through it for 2 hours let alone any extended cuts they make later on lets say i hated this movie enough to make an account here to comment
Jul 24 2016,positive,x men is my favorite recent movie but i just had a great time during this movie  im 65and i dont compare it to anything that went before  it stands on its own  dont listen to the bias
Jul 24 2016,negative,i dont know what i expected i like ghost busters i saw the trailer and thought oh its just a bad trailer it can be that bad i was so wrong god awful scooby doo like special effects garbage snl jokes and the cast is terrible its starts off ok but it nose dives after the first half
Jul 24 2016,positive,i thought it was really enjoyable so i admit i was wrong to automatically assume it would be crap of course its not as good as the original two but as a film on its own it was entertaining and funny especially chris hemsworth i really liked the effects and all of the nods to the original films
Jul 24 2016,negative,yawnfest four women all top comedians they werent very funny the blonde thing with the glasses everytime she opened her gub i was like fuck off my tv hemsworth you should be punished for that character never allowed to act again stay puff was marshmallow for a fucking reason you cunts not a fucking balloon i gave it this rating and not lower because i liked some of the ghosts
Jul 24 2016,negative,the film was light hearted at first but then quickly turned into a disappointment the introduction of the old cast members but not as their original characters was disappointing the storyline and the subplots of the characters were boring     its a shame they touched this will it be remembered in the same as the original no
Jul 24 2016,positive,these ladies did a wonderful job glad i didnt listen to all the negative reviews posted
Jul 24 2016,negative,i felt the film did a few things right while completely botching others lets talk about what i hated first because lets face it we all like it when someone tears down movies in funny ways ghostbusters spends a lot of time dropping in references and throwbacks to the original film which for me were delightfully sentimental at the same time if i wanted to watch the original i would have stolen my parents copy what i dont have money for things like movies and my ultra conservative christian parents would probably only watch the original ghostbusters films while drunk which is to say never fans of the original will be relieved to know that the atrocious fall out boy version of the theme song only appears once while the original makes three appearances plus one orchestral remake    the storyline that brings together our four main characters is fairly solid but falls flatter than my chest in the buildup to the climax of the film i feel like theres a sex joke to be made here but i dont think sex deserves to be ridiculed like that the problem is that the plot is taken way too seriously and doesnt feel like im supposed to laugh as i mentioned they threw in a shit ton of references to the original ghostbusters as if those references were funny on their own jillian holtzmann holtz gets a fight scene that was clearly meant to elicit laughter at its unabashed trinityfromthematrixmeetsriversongfromfirefly routine but instead it just kinda left me scratching my head    patty tolan despite what im sure seemed like a fullyfleshed out character in the gop convei mean writers room felt like a stereotype of a every black woman character i tried to like her in part because i wanted to wave two middle fingers at the racist haters who basically chased her off twitter in a virtual lynch mob fuck milo yiannopoulos unfortunately she was pretty much the sassy black woman trope embodied still fuck milo yiannopoulos i know leslie jones tried to defend her portrayal and honestly ill probably watch just about anything leslie jones does from now on but her character was terribly written and it wasnt fair to a woman who clearly has more talent than the stilted kristen wiig    did i mention how awful kristen wiigs performance was im pretty sure that was a cardboard cutout of her slapped onto a body double but that might be overly generous wiig was so awful that no amount of superb writing could have saved her i didnt believe for a moment she was erin gilbert i didnt believe she was attracted to kevin chris hemsworth much less ready to drop her panties at the first sight of him which by language of the dialogue is what ive gathered was supposed to be the takeaway thats an impressive feat of failure considering that my homoflexible self would drop her panties in a heartbeat for chris hemsworth    speaking of shitty performances i cant tell if it was bad acting or shitty writing but my guess is both what the fuck was up with mckinnon hanging out in the back constantly drooling over her equipment was there possibly something slightly more funny they could have had her do holtz is a goddamn nuclear engineer and you couldnt have had her do more than sit around halfsmiling as she nurses a weapon like an ice cream cone for such a transphobic shitlord i was expecting something overthetop but i dont think she has more than 50 words in the entire script    one more thing before i transition over to the things i liked the jokes were pretty awful one of the things ive been learning in my own efforts to write standup is that you dont use other peoples jokes there are exceptions but they do not apply here almost every joke in the film was a poorly reused old joke in some ways i feel like the writers set these women up to fail in a franchise that has a very loyal albeit horribly misogynistic crybaby fanbase you know how they say a monkey typing would have an infinitesimal chance of replicating a work of shakespeare the writing was comparable to a first attempt at testing that theory the entirety of the film was written as if old jokes and nostalgia could carry us through the nearly two hour film id accuse tommy wiseau of ghostwriting the script but im not sure wiseau could fuck up this bad at least the room was funny    ok have you had enough of all that was awful in ghostbusters lets talk about what i liked melissa mccarthy boom that woman is an angel seriously forget mckinnon and wiig just give jones and mccarthy this script and the freedom to improvise and this film would have been a lot stronger mccarthy is such an emotive actor that she could make me laugh at why did the chicken cross the road jokes mccarthy and jones seemed to be completely immersed in their characters to the point that in the case of mccarthy i didnt see sookie st james she was hilarious and i love her more now than i did after watching gilmore girls    i loved that they made kevin the male bimbo although it was fairly heteronormative i feel like it made sense in the context of role reversals to have a famous male actor play a character who is nothing but fan service    and thats about it there was literally very little that could be said about this movie that was positive this film was certifiable shit and not for the reasons the dudebro true fans were saying it would be
Jul 24 2016,negative,73 rating why that huge score stop trying to be political correct
Jul 24 2016,positive,did ghostbusters 2016 have to be made no is it worth a watch yes this film adapts the 1984 ghostbusters story to the modern times in a smart funny way with excellent chemistry between the 4 girls and chris hemsworth my biggest problems with this film however is the cgi towards the end and the boring generic villain
Jul 24 2016,positive,my children took me to the 3 d movie for my birthday loved it   we didnt stop laughing throughout the entire movie 
Jul 24 2016,positive,better than i thought very good though love melissa she is awesome
Jul 24 2016,neutral,not the best movie but far from the worst
Jul 24 2016,negative,horrible movie bad acting an embarrassment to the industry these useless hollywood writers need to develop initiative and insight for new movie ideas rehashing old movies is not workingthey are all disappointing bad films such as clash of the titans red dawn annie carrie godzilla and robocopjust to name a few  this was probably the worst one yet
Jul 24 2016,negative,by far the worst movie i have seen the movie had little plot and was not funny at all the cast was nice
Jul 24 2016,positive,sporadically funny this all female reboot is not the stinker that the trailer suggested it does lose momentum in the protracted finale though
Jul 24 2016,positive,not bad at all but did wish the jokes were a bit more clever and not suited for 5 year olds leslie jones is hilarious but it was the typical loud black girl role i do hope for a sequel
Jul 24 2016,negative,the cdi was great and seeing the old grew was cool but the acting and the plot sucks you had a dumb ass man playing the secretary i could not find interest in any of their thought in the movie
Jul 24 2016,negative,they should have done a star trek style reboot and gotten more from the original cast weaved in this version stinks the 4 main busters were horribly miscast and i dont get why they did this trash film utterly disappointing and i saw it for free
Jul 24 2016,negative,unfunny annoying doesnt compare to the original movies and clearly states the financial motivation of sony
Jul 24 2016,positive,while certainly not as good as the originals the movie had a ton of impressively subtle throwbacks like the way pringles hung from holtzmans lips being a throwback to how rays cigarette hung when he first saw slimer     the technology they used looked like pretty believable as homemade the effects were a liiiitle overdone but not nearly as much as most movies the comedy was great even tho the characters had a far modern more absurd comedy feel than the more deadpan goofy humor of the originals which i think the movie could have used more of the movie unfortunately turned what should have been serious scary ghost scenes into comedic moments which wasnt done in the original and broke a bit of the suspension of disbelief     but overall a fantastic movie with good comedy and hopefully a good setup for an even more excellent sequel
Jul 24 2016,positive,a good balance between new material and a nod to the original
Jul 24 2016,negative,i went in with low expectations as the original ghostbusters is one of my all time favourites and its one i have seen countless of times this movie had familiar elements from the original it was good to see old cast members and it had a good cast but its not a movie that i would watch again and again
Jul 24 2016,positive,pretty tepid doesnt have the spirit of the original special effects are pretty cool but that doesnt help kate mckinnon is the only one that kinda saves the show but even thats not enough
Jul 24 2016,positive,this movie really surprised me in how well it was pulled off with all of the hate going around i thought it would be crap but honestly i had a fantastic time watching this film all of the characters made me laugh and kate mckinnons  holtzmann was my favourite with her wacky weirdness which reminded me of myself the movie isnt perfect but it was really really good and this reboot did a fantastic job at capturing the essence of the franchise and it gives me so much hope for further representation of women within the film industry
Jul 24 2016,negative,this movie fails really hard it had so many good ideas so many good concepts that they could have made a film off of but instead it just seems like they made a very long and dual snl piece of crap this isnt ghostbusters 2016 it should be know as ghostbusters snl i really do hate the fact that they had so many good ideas female ghostbusters its been dont in the tv show and the comics only those forms of female ghostbusters did it far better you have a villain that uses ghostbuster tech to summon ghost seriously they couldnt see how that could have been used in a plot to get the ghostbusters into trouble and have to prove their innocents using laylines to boost spiritual activity they could have been really cool to use as a plot point at least better presented then in this movie   the villain of this movie was just bad and i mean he really was worthless he goes from outcast mental case loner to possessing the moron receptionist to a cartoon homage to the classic real ghostbusters cartoon intro ghost to a 30 foot tall oogy boogy from nightmare before christmas and how do they beat him they reverse the flow of the portal he made and shoot him in the groin hes a ghost pretty sure he dont have those no more    thats another thing this entire movie was pushing an agenda in fact it was kind of pushing a lot of them bottom line is this movie was bad if i want my daughter to look up to good female role models since that seems to be how sony and them have started to try and spin this abomination i would much rather her look up to maleficent from the classic story of sleeping beauty then this movie again this movie had some great ideas but they just failed so hard with this and the sad thing is these ladies arent bad actors they really could have pulled off a much better movie i mostly blame the director and sony entertainment    sonyfails
Jul 24 2016,negative,this is the worstest movie evar
Jul 23 2016,negative,the 1984 film is much better
Jul 23 2016,negative,first the good things its a new ghostbusters film theres cameos from the original cast chris hemsworth is funny and thats it    its racist token black person sexist they only have chris hemsworth because of his looks and feminist propaganda genderswapping roles and shooting the final ghost in the genitals its poorly written and the effects are too scooby doo quality and thats not a good thing    do yourself a favour and dont see it go watch the original two ghostbusters films and the real ghostbusters cartoons instead
Jul 23 2016,negative,ghostbuters the reboot is lazy meandering and insulting in the first act the biggest laughs came from a queef joke a poopoo joke and someone giving another character the finger the villain is a boring character played by a bland actor all of the cameos are sad except for annie pots who was still in classic janine mode bill murrays was the worst  and the strangest his character seemed so outofplace it almost felt like his scenes were filmed with a different actor but he was added in reshoots he brought nothing to the very limited role and appeared to be reciting the lines that were written for him so he could go home they put a funny hat on him and gave him a cane we hear a queef slimer burps kate mckinnon mugs for the camera borrows from mel brooks and mike myers and tries to be part of a comedic machine that is out of order the rock concert scene is so tired and hacky you almost expect to see smashmouth instead we get ozzy osborne whose joke line left my audience dead silent  they reinvented the pke meter only to make it look stupid not content with proton packs that make a sweetened version of the startup sfx but do not use the classic streaming noise the characters end up with proton grenades proton guns and a proton fist and all of these go directly against the idea of ghostbusters as paranormal firefighters the proton packs temporarily subdue ghosts but the reboot needs to have them shoot punch and obliterate the ghosts with a little extra violence theres destruction in the original gb movie yes but they are side effects of using a tool to great comic effect i do not see a need to have these new characters literally punching ghosts and heaving grenades at them the only thing we can be thankful for is the big disco dance scene feig promised in his leaked email while spitballing the reboot was cut from the film it was placed in the end credits presumably because there are two other scenes where characters dance around to dumb old songs to make up for the lack of jokes if it werent a ghostbusters reboot this would be not as bad as an adam sandler film and soon forgotten since its what passes for a ghostbusters movie in 2016 it is deserving of all the hate it gets
Jul 23 2016,positive,casting gags chemistry and cameos its got it all didnt go in with high expectations but loved it
Jul 23 2016,negative,i saw the original ghostbusters when i was a kid and i loved them this movie not so much
Jul 23 2016,negative,was it as bad as i thought it was going to be no was it what i expected no that being said it was still a very plain and boring movie nothing about this movie stands out it is not funny i may have chuckled once or twice the movie depends on name recognition alone in order to reel in anyone who saw it and anyone not brought in on that probably showed up just to support the female ghostbusters fortunately the fact that they are all women does not take away from the movie unfortunately the female cast does not add anything to the film either the best part of this movie was the brief cameo from bill murray and for that alone i give this movie one star
Jul 23 2016,positive,the movie was a lot of fun very funny with great visuals a good energy and some really tense moderately scary moments  and i think thats one thing that makes it stand out from the original theres something far scarier and more credible about the visually creative energy of the new movie    the comedy worked very well i enjoyed everything kate mckinnon as hotlzmann did  hemsworth was funnier than i could have imagined him being      there were a lot of times i laughed  there were a lot of times i was holding my breath in suspense  there were a lot of times i was delighted to see the action unfold    this one ill be seeing again soon
Jul 23 2016,positive,hilarious a great reboot
Jul 23 2016,positive,the usual mccarthy rapidfirequips  toilethumor asidereimagined ghostbusters2016 are surprisingly entertaining plus thor 355scales
Jul 23 2016,positive,laugh out loud funny a great remake but it also stands alone as a solid comedy
Jul 23 2016,negative,didnt like it but i liked some of the cameos
Jul 23 2016,neutral,they try very hard sometimes too hard  kate mckinnon and hemsworth stand out and everyone else is okay at best whiig flounders in her usual awkward type role   not the horrid movie everyone makes it out to be but very average and doesnt live up to the franchise  still an okay watch
Jul 23 2016,positive,this movie is hilarious suck it haters
Jul 23 2016,negative,sucked save your money wait for it on redbox
Jul 23 2016,positive,loved it would see again
Jul 23 2016,positive,just another sequelmy daughter says its 50 stars so am raising my stars from 2 and half to 3
Jul 23 2016,positive,loved it enjoyed all of the cameo appearances from the original great movie
Jul 23 2016,positive,huge fan of the original have seen gb and gb2 countless times was super excited to see this was not one bit disappointed kids gave it 11 out of 10 stars they do know how stars work and were cracking up the whole time we were cracking up too the jokes came at a great pace awesome acting and i cant wait for the sequel suck it nerds
Jul 23 2016,neutral,starting off with no i dont hate this movie cuz its women ghostbusters im a very big fan of these actresses and had high hopes for this film sadly the flaws lie with a mediocre script terrible jokes and a campy villain while the original is immensely quotable nobody will be quoting this film in a month let alone 30 years lacks all the charm that made the original so memorable and overall feels like yet another hollywood cash grab at starting a big universe franchise rental at best
Jul 23 2016,positive,a hilarious addition to the ghostbuster franchise
Jul 23 2016,negative,one of the worst movies i have ever seen  in fact i think people should see it just to discuss how bad this isso freakin bad im convince anyone who gives this a good review is a shill for the studio i cannot see how or why anyone enjoyed it
Jul 23 2016,negative,why is this movie certified fresh i took my 13 year old daughter to see this film expecting some really good entertainment for the 30 spent on tickets instead we saw one of the worst movies weve ever seen my daughter who is usually easily amused only laughed twice and i was nodding off towards the end we ended up obtaining a refund this is the first time a rt rating has steered me wrong i really dont understand how this movie could possibly be rated so well by critics what am i missing here
Jul 23 2016,positive,not the worst movie ive seen this year cough batman vs superman cough stephen kings cell cough but still pretty bad  if it wasnt for the sexist and feminist review battle i honestly feel like the reviews would be more average across the board    mellissa mccarthy and kristen wigg are in my opinion the two most entertaining characters while kate mckinnon and ugh chris hemsworth are not funny at all hemsworth should just not have a comedic role and ive never understood why anyone likes mckinnon    im sure kids will love it and its a good family film so i leveled at a 3 star rating but its just a ploy on nostalgia that decided to shame people into feeling sexist if they disliked the film in response to a small ignorant group of internet trolls despite the fact that jones character is a walking talking stereotype streetsmart sassy only nonwhite non scientist lead very progressive
Jul 23 2016,negative,the chemistry between the actors seemed a little off to me  the special effects were good  but the plot and acting just was not as good as it could have been and did not come off as funny as the original  it might have been poor editing of some of the scenes but that is just a guess  the cameo appearances also seemed to imply the movie needed a boost and was not strong enough by itself but could also be seen as a tipping of the hat to the original overall i was not impressed with this movie
Jul 23 2016,positive,this was an incredibly funny film with a great cast though the product placements and constant cameos took me out of the film a few times
Jul 23 2016,positive,much more entertaining than i expected
Jul 23 2016,negative,reboot  lazy excuse to not have to follow the established timeline that we are all invested in watching this movie was like watching a poor film adaptation of a  wonderful and beloved book the original movies are very much part of our culture mr feig pooped all over our established culture with a cheap and lazy reimagination of something that did not need reimagining the two original ghostbusters movies are solid bedrock perfect for adding more content to an already rich story line the reboot did have a wonderful cast top to bottom but those poor people were stuck in a cheap piece of trash to add insult to injury there were lots of reference jokes to the original films and sad cameos from the original actors to read the original actors comments on this movie is like reading comments from republican party members that hate trump but are now obligated to support him
Jul 23 2016,positive,really hilarious and the story was great too
Jul 23 2016,positive,much like the first ghostbusters this movie relied pretty heavily on its stellar cast and some hilarious improvised moments but the story itself struggled at points the homagescameos felt forced and the franchiseyness was a bit much basically i would have rather seen feig direct this cast in an original story rather than a paint by numbers affair i still laughed  because how could you not with these stars  but i would take this directors other efforts over this in a heartbeat
Jul 23 2016,negative,saw it it was not very good
Jul 23 2016,negative,this movie was so disappointing for me because i was so looking forward to a great comedy with these great and talented ladies and this movie was actually scary i cant tell you how many times i yelled out loud jumped and squeezed my boyfriends hand off what i say what a waste of talent with these ladies the funny parts are all in the  commercials so thats it the rest is scary so be aware
Jul 23 2016,negative,what a boring unfunny movie dont bother first 80 min no action
Jul 23 2016,positive,the movie was hilarious not as good as the original but better then the second ghostbusters movie i really loved it i hope they make a second
Jul 23 2016,negative,superb casting for a painfully awkward script leslie jones keeps the movie alive with laughoutloud character of patty but not even hilarious clinton mimic kate mckinnons valiant attempts alongside that of mccarthy and wiig do much to fill in the boring gaps of the poorly drawn out characters most jokes if thats what theyre supposed to be earn more cringes than laughs and hemsworths character makes you want to repeatedly bang your head against a wall just to see how someone could be that braindead i truly wish i could be part of the minority who enjoyed the movie but alas i find myself earnestly sided with the 950 thousand or so who disliked the youtube trailer
Jul 23 2016,positive,hilarious all characters came together and worked off each others snarky remarks loved all the cameos definitely worth seeing again
Jul 23 2016,negative,horrible not funny poorly directed terrible timing terrible acting and horrible writing just head shakingly bad  critic reviews are padded
Jul 23 2016,negative,crappy movie its one of those remakes that is terrible its bad enough hollywood keeps remaking movies but they seem to remake them worse they have weapons that kill ghosts really the ghost in already dead but you have a tool that will make sure its dead i think during the whole movie i laughed twice the special effects were good but no worth going to the movie theater to see it wait for redbox or something
Jul 23 2016,positive,something strange in the neighborhood who you gonna call let me tell ya what its the same answer today as it was thirty years ago even with all the hate on the trailer and all female cast im here to tell you the freaking ghostbusters are back if you walk in comparing it to the originals yes youll be dissapointed theyre classics with mega star legends dont go thinking it as a direct sequel either i wouldnt even classify it as a remake what i would call it is a breath of fresh air for a new generation these 4 ladies rocked it and had fun doing so and it showed they fed off eachother i thought each had a great energy it was entertaining and the gadgets were pretty cool too chris helmsworth was hilarious as their secretary and committed to the role 100 if thats not enough for you the original cast was behind this and all made cameos this franchise was one of my favorites growing up and im glad to say they are back go see it show your support the answer is ghostbusters loveforlesliej
Jul 23 2016,positive,im not even a triggered feminist and i thought this movie was decent
Jul 23 2016,positive,i really liked it  it was funny suspenseful the girls were funny and there is an appearance by almost all the major past characters but one
Jul 23 2016,positive,really funny new take on an old favorite they make it their own great cast and terrific cameos
Jul 23 2016,positive,several funny situations
Jul 23 2016,positive,i was a huge fan of the original ghostbusters films and i was worried this wouldnt live up to my expectations but it did and even exceeded them  it was funny entertaining and full of action from beginning to end  i actually want to go see this movie again  great movie  i hope they make a sequel 
Jul 23 2016,negative,boy i did not enjoy this movie
Jul 23 2016,positive,solid effort and thoroughly enjoyable we loved the cameos from the old cast it would have been better if we had not so loved the original and had that to compare it to hopefully a new generation who have not seen the original can see it with fresh eyes i thought holtzman was superb hemsworth was fabulous and mccarthy solid i the lead some of the dialogue was a bit forced at times but it was a good time and lots of fun
Jul 23 2016,positive,i absolutely loved it the movie paid tribute to the original and it was just fun the girls were funny and chris hemsworth seemed to enjoy making fun of himself definitely glad i went to see it
Jul 23 2016,negative,i had higher hopes for this its sad when the best part of the movie is in the credits
Jul 23 2016,positive,i loved it ill be taking my little sister to show her a bit of representation
Jul 23 2016,negative,a mediocre story with lame jokes that fell flatthe pacing is all wrong and it just goes on for too long
Jul 23 2016,negative,watched it hoping for the better but ended bored found the movie completely predictable the actresses and actors in the movie are better then this i have a feeling the movie imo is a bomb due to scripts and writing
Jul 23 2016,positive,this cast hit it out of the park big thanks to paul feig for another snortoutloud summer comedy never boring always silly  mckinnon was my favorite and im looking forward to her hijinks in the sequel glad to see neal casey as the villain poor guy didnt get featured in the trailer    this would be a 5 if not for the callbackscameos they weighed it down too much winking and dropping the ball on fleshing out pattys character i bet theres stuff that got cut and a directors cut will probably fix that second thing     but then the nods to the controversy surrounding the movie even before it was made the general eff yall were doing our thing makes me give that half star back seen it once looking forward to seeing it in theaters at least twice more the power of patty compels me
Jul 23 2016,positive,the trailers made it look awful but i was pleasantly surprised not a perfect movie but totally fun and worth watching
Jul 23 2016,positive,a simple summer action comedy not super complex but its not dumb either laughed and was entertained so job well done
Jul 23 2016,positive,im a huge fan of the original movies and the animated series and i think this is a solid addition to the franchise all of the actresses did a stellar job but kate mckinnon really stole the show watching her during the battle scene gave me chills and i loved   everything about her character i only deduct half a  star because some of the jokes seemed a little forced but the majority of them were very funny  i loved seeing the cameos from the original cast and am hoping they make a sequel to this my husband and kids  11f and 6m loved it as well will be purchasing when its released on dvd
Jul 23 2016,positive,i know at first there was a big uproar when this movie was being made but original ghostbusters fans do it themselves disservice not seeing this to me it was like an alternative universe was seeing this for the first time and yes for the younger generation it is the story was well written and yes similar to the original but of course with a female cast paul feig coming off spy which i enjoyed did an acceptable job the laughs are definitely there and action was pretty good my daughter loved it which was a surprise strong 4 stars out of 5    13 year old has it 5 stars out of 5yes 5 i asked her twice
Jul 23 2016,negative,this was a pretty good flick if you can get past the subtle and not so subtle tones of the movie theres nothing i hate more than a film with hidden messages its watchable once but i wont be adding it to my collection or watching it again its a one and done it does pay homage to the original cast in a unique way and it is quiet funny so enjoyable fun and different just not groundbreaking awesome or lasting
Jul 23 2016,positive,i had so much fun watching this if youre looking for an enjoyable couple of hours ghostbusters offers that i can think of no more valuable perspective to offer than that
Jul 23 2016,positive,i enjoyed this movie i know some people that thought this movie was going to be shit but for what seemed to me to be a family friendly movie i thought it was pleasant i like all of the cast i thought there were plenty of funny moments leslie jones  kate mckinnon were my favorites i liked the nods to the original ghostbusters films too i think that was an important decision to keep the old fans of the original happy thors character was pretty funny too i thought all of the cgi was really well done the ghosts looked great they looked beautiful even
Jul 23 2016,negative,kind of funny but no where near as good as the first one
Jul 23 2016,positive,what a fun movie pure positive entertainment there isnt one thing about this movie that isnt respectful of the original series of movies the average audience rating is being seriously depressed by some reviewers as i guy i was very sorry to see how many of the hateful reviews are posted by guys
Jul 23 2016,positive,it was better than i thought it would be but not as good as it could have been
Jul 23 2016,positive,they did a fantastic job with 3
Jul 23 2016,positive,this was a great movie it does the original much justice  recommend to all
Jul 23 2016,positive,the whole audience was laughing during the entire movie these women rock
Jul 23 2016,positive,i enjoyed the movie quite a bit it wasnt as funny as it could have been and some of the jokes were pretty dumb but the leading ladies had plenty of charisma the story was fun and the action was actually pretty great  the movie gets a much worse rap than it deserves from people
Jul 23 2016,positive,i went in to this movie with incredibly low expectations via the trailers and early reviews but i have to say that i was pleasantly surprised im not saying this movie is in any way close to being on the same level as its predecessor was in terms of its comedy or story writing but it was decently paced the acting was not nearly as overthetop as the trailers suggested and did have a few laughs though not nearly as many as the original its not a great movie but its not terrible either after seeing it i tend to believe that most people who are annoyed with this movie have two main problems with it 1 most fans of the franchise really wanted a sequel not a reboot the fact that the leads were women is incidental to most fans with the exception of the few true mysoginists out there i think it would have been more widely accepted if the lead women were perhaps the daughters of the original cast or related somehow and continuing on in their footsteps 2 there is a sense of feminist girl power in the movie and that tends to irritate anyone who doesnt like politically agenda driven movies but having watched it now it really is benign and while there is a sense of girl power throughout the movie i didnt find it foreboding in any way nor did i think the director or writers were seemingly thrusting it in the viewers faces gratuitously     all in all i took my daughter to see the movie and expected to be sitting beside her rolling my eyes the entire fil but found myself having a decent viewing experience any backlash against the movie is a bit unwarranted and while i like most other ghostbusters fans would have rather seen a sequel than are reboot with this cast i still believe that they did a sufficient enough job to keep the audiences coming back to see the inevitable sequel
Jul 23 2016,positive,while not as hilarious as bridesmaids it still had some really good stuff and id definitely worth the time
Jul 23 2016,negative,this was a horrible movie there were a few moments where i chuckled but ultimately it was a huge letdown the all female cast was an interesting take on the original ghostbusters but the type of humor that was generally portrayed was lacking i will give it one star if for no other reason than the cgi was really cool it came across as a little cartoony which fits perfect with the ghostbusters franchise i will admit that i can see potential for this type of remake but for something as extreme as changing the entire main cast from an all male to an allfemale roster the casting needs to be perfect
Jul 23 2016,negative,they tried too hard it seems an extended snl skit
Jul 23 2016,negative,not a good movie at all
Jul 23 2016,negative,the funniest part of this whole move was a joke they stole from an old simpsons episode where ned flanders screams like a woman this should tell you all you need to know
Jul 23 2016,positive,good show good entertainment
Jul 23 2016,positive,well that was a pleasant surprise saw gb this afternoon with my family and loved it wasnt sure what to expect after the trailer not great but wanted to give it a chance glad we did it was funny wellwritten acted and directed didnt see any girl power stuff which i was glad of  that kind of thing isnt necessary so many nice callbacks to the original film that were very subtle not in your face seewhatwedidthere and some nice cameos film moved along at a nice pace no wasted story telling maybe a little scary for young children but there was a small child sitting in front of us and she loved it worth the price of admission
Jul 23 2016,negative,it wasnt very funny the jokes were childish and unoriginal
Jul 23 2016,negative,this movie is garbage
Jul 23 2016,negative,saw it after some substantial encouragement  there were a handful of funny moments but otherwise it was deeply mediocre and dull to sit through    not very original but also not true to the original the movie played like it was written by a computer    on the plus side it was funny on a meta level to see chris hemsworth as dumb eye candy  which is about all hes good for
Jul 23 2016,positive,captures the spirit of the original while remaining fresh kate mckinnon steals the show with subtle comedic gold
Jul 23 2016,positive,not a bad take on the original
Jul 23 2016,positive,i liked it the girls did a great job i hope to see a sequel
Jul 23 2016,positive,it doesnt have a reason to exist
Jul 23 2016,negative,worst remake ever boring unfunny should have never been made
Jul 23 2016,positive,so funny i am a huge fan of the original gb so this was fun also melissa is hilarious
Jul 23 2016,negative,okay all you people who told me this was only mediocre are liars the beginning was great very nice ramp up pulled me in immediately the middle felt as schlocky as the macgyver snl reboot not my speed but some like it and the final act made me walk out before the end it just got worse and worse until it was impossible to redeem and people i trusted acted like it was a fun but intellectually spare film with a really bad publicity campaign i thought fine its like prometheus then but its not i dont even think you can make a film this bad on accident the writing and especially the pacing was so weird after the villain is introduced it goes from mild cringing at poorly conceived and delivered jokes to pure chaotic evil editing the main fight scene all the way to the boss fight was all timed super evenly like it was going through the motions 1 2 3 and taunt and shootfall and 1 2 3 and quip and missfire but this went for about two rounds of each woman taking turns during the major fight scene and by the final showdown theyd run out of tauntsthe comebacks didnt even make sense but sure they managed to keep the pace up taunt and shoot wait for dodge and counter taunt then random comeback and shoot and wait for doge and counter taunt i can only imagine the director did something very personal to the editor to tick them off and they sabotaged this jurassic park style  im not going to even delve too deep into the weird acting genres clashing with each other but it was super bizarre the blondes were the worst i think one was doing an overthetop bullys impression of a mentally handicapped child and the other was trying to imitate columbia from rocky horror everyone else has already objected to leslie jones character but ive never seen her play anything but this character its one of the reasons i quit watching snl its boring and its lame i thought the only two characters which actually had backstories handled themselves the best but im very confused by the villain hes not menacing he doesnt come off as smart despite them telling us he is and his motivation is very shallow they should have made the ghostbusters fight the editor thats a true evil mastermind who would have presented a challenge and im dying to know his thought process as for the director even a high school theater teacher would have been yelling cut youre indicating not acting mugging and flailing do not work when youre in a scene with other people who can act and to the countless articles saying women needed this no we dont we need quality storytelling same as anyone else you want to make your film a feminist landmark put some actual effort into it thinking that women are so starved for quality female leads that well pretend this is good demonstrates a concerning level of film illiteracy and is of course a huge insult to the intelligence of women
Jul 23 2016,positive,i think that those that did not like this movie were being too nostalgic for the original  this movie was absolutely hilarious  there are so many great one liners that i can watch this movie over and over again and still catch something new  all four actresses were amazing and so hilarious
Jul 23 2016,positive,i laughed middle of the road though
Jul 23 2016,positive,so much fun great continuation of the first one
Jul 23 2016,positive,its not a remake its more like a retake so i dug it my only complaints were when they allowed themselves to be called girls great effects entertaining story
Jul 23 2016,positive,i thought this was a good movie it had me laughing and kept me entertained i would say for what it is a summer comedy it was really well done
Jul 23 2016,positive,it was a awesome movie i love it it was funny âºâºâºâºâºâº
Jul 23 2016,negative,one would think that after so many years of bouncing around a sequel to the original that someone would have come up with a decent story to reboot this franchise alas what we have here is a 5th grade level script with virtually no character development and horrendous dialog the direction consists mostly of what appears to be weak improvised lines followed by stupid reaction expressions primarily by kate mckinnon from snl so weak the ghosts are pretty cool looking but their origin and reason for being are never really fleshed out none of the female leads really have much of an opportunity to be funny because the script is so weak there are a number of cameos basically consisting of one line appearances by the previous living cast members which are not memorable this is marginal entertainment at best and that is only because of the ghosts 1 12 out of 5 stars
Jul 23 2016,positive,an excellent retelling of the premise they wisely created their own chemistry instead of trying to dupe the original well done
Jul 23 2016,positive,i wasnt going to see this movie because i didnt want to tarnish the memory of the original  i have never been happier to be wrong  this movie completely stands on its own with a great cast storyline and abcrunching hilarity to top it off they paid great homage to the original at every turn  dont leave before the credits finish   i cant wait to see it again
Jul 23 2016,negative,i wouldnt wish this turd stain on my worst enemy to all the people saying its not that bad compared to what if your expectation for the movie is so low that you just hope your not going to gouge your eyes out its not that bad means its is comparatively horrible to a normal movie going experience it is too bad this movie had all the potential in the world with great actresseswait thats all it had writing was horrible cg is over done and the story while simplistic makes little to non sense spoiler here       the reddit leaked script from the editors assistant that has been deleted and reuploaded elsewhere is accurate that leaked script is beyond horrible also the man hating was egregious add to it that sony threatened to sue bill murray if he didnt act in this hot mess all adds up to this i wouldnt watch it if they paid me too
Jul 23 2016,positive,everything a reboot should be absolutely loved it
Jul 23 2016,negative,dear dan ackroyd    who ya gonna call  was it twenty years after the event or perhaps 30 was it years beyond the ones in which your star had finally shone its last was the turning point 911 or obamas inauguration was it when the aliens finally scrambled your mind was it when the wine became too much  was it when the faux feminism became all the rage when florence nightingale edith cavill and countless others had gone before was it when women can do this too became achingly hip when the only thing that was needed was an abundance of oestrogen without the comprehension that subtle intelligence was needed as well  was it when the first character of the first scene uttered the first words railing against circuses was it when the black female lead was the sassy loweducated type seen in a hundred thousand cliché ridden movies  was it when the only male characters of any substance portrayed by once discerning talents buffooned staggered and disgraced their way around the screen  was it the heavy metal being associated with evil spirits and the presence of ozzy osbourne himself   was it the cameos and the continuity errors and the incoherent script and the foul language and the pop culture references and the poor cgi and the giant ghost stumbling across the screen just like the giant marshmallow man seen again and the giant statue of liberty  was it then was it then that you realised that you had called all of the wrong people was it then that you found that you had trampled on the childhood of so many was it then that you understood that there are few ideas for the desperate sequel  did you care
Jul 23 2016,negative,this movie was terrible on so many levels   the only joke i laughed at was the baba booey joke at the end  the rest of it just had me cringing and wondering why the movie was even necessary from anything other than a because we can standpoint    going back to what comicbook girl had said about this movie it was totally soulless and uninspiring  i felt no sense camaraderie or emotional attachment to it  the movie was moving way too fast and had no pacing  one minute patty is an mta worker and the next shes catching ghosts with little effort  i distinctly remember the original ghostbusters having to go through large hurdles of disbelief both from the gbs themselves and the publicatlarge before they started believing in ghosts  yet im supposed to believe that an entire concert hall is taking selfies with a ghost without issue  it also lacked a good mythology like the story of zuul the keymaster and gatekeeper from the original  that was totally absent from this film and thus everything just seemed like filler    secondly was the chemistry between the girls  it was there but it wasnt representative of what a true new york blue collar vibe is and we got that from the original cast  and its certainly not a knock a shortcomings of an allfemale cast because all you need to do is look at a nyc firehouse and notice how the women carry themselves  that would have been much more representative of the team  which brings me to my next point nyc was sort of a character untoitself in the original and the very fact that many of the scenes lacked the grit and demeanor of true new york culture completely stripped it of its personality  i distinctly remember the mayor of the original saying being miserable and treating other people like dirt is every new yorkers godgiven right  where was that in this film  it was completely absent    thirdly the music was not as good  i distinctly remember the original for its soundtrack especially the nonchalant jazz piano vibe it had  and where were the spooky themes  was there even any music in this film   hell there wasnt a single montage in it a defining feature of the original two films    thirdly my biggest peeve of this film was that they were constantly breaking the fourth wall  i get it the villain is a personification of some basementdwelling neckbeard who was bullied his entire life and now seeks revenge but really  i get paul you hate bullies  oh and how could i forget about the dumb story by kristen wiigs character about being bullied in school and losing friends for believing in ghosts or the unapologetic pokes at youtube comments aint no bitches gonna catch ghosts  how about the ending  lets shoot the villain in the groin  ohhhh yeah  huehuehuehue sooooo funny  face palm  you literally have to be 12 years old to think thats funny    finally there was no fan treatment here  the only nods to the original were the terrible cameos  akroyds was the best but only because he gave a good new york vibe with i dont drive to queens  that was one of the few times i chuckled and its what was missing from this film when i referred to it having no nyc soul  but even murray one of my favorite comedians of all time wasnt funny  yes bill murray was not funny and at most  it just really showed how terribly this film was written and produced    if youre a diehard fan of the originals youre going to hate this movie  kill it with fire  it deserves 15 stars  garbage and im glad i didnt pay to see it
Jul 23 2016,positive,good clean classic fun and plenty of familiar faces from the original fun
Jul 23 2016,neutral,its not as bad as people say but it is definitely not good it had nothing to do with its cast as i find them all funny in other features it had more to do with the fact that it was just not that well written nor was it conceived and it could have been just so much better directed and done plus the cameos often made no sense most the humor while occasionally funny seemed forced
Jul 23 2016,negative,total garbage unfunny but for some reason the film thinks its hilarious insulting offensive crude pointless miscast illogical nonsensical childish cashgrab of a film with inyourface product placement hollywood at its absolute worst forced cameos forced fartjokefalling over gags humour stupid and dumb the villain was so stupid and none of anything he did made any sense even when he turned to the camera and speaks aloud his motivations of being bullied and hated and how hell punish us all garbage    avoid this movie
Jul 23 2016,positive,not a complete disaster which i think is a pretty good result for this ghostbusters was never a good idea for a remake i think the worst part was chris helmsworths character i really really cant stand dumb characters where all of the jokes are about them being unrealistically dumb this to me gets old very quickly but apparently others enjoy this what really hurts this film though is that there is not really any plot ghosts come there is some sort of bad guy but he doesnt really have a plan or a motive of any originality in the end its an ending similar to xmen apocalypse that is my magic beats your magic for no discernible reason safely skippable but as i say not dreadful kate mckinnon is bound to be a star soon enough
Jul 23 2016,positive,i think the movie is just perfect what it lacks in story line and story telling it compensates in the magnificent cast  except for hemsworth 
Jul 23 2016,positive,so i just watched ghostbusters today and to be honest it exceeded my expectations its so much better than the trailers i was expecting it to be just a plain ol comedy like bridesmaids which id still like and id seen so much on youtube already but there was so much more to it than that it had elements of horror and amazing fight sequences which came together really nicely and it didnt look like a random mix bag of genres there were a lot of special appearances from the original cast as well and i mean a lot one i didnt even know about udidnt   overall the movie had a really classic feel to it but with a modern cast and screenplay    they could have made more use of chris character and put more thought into integrating him with the story better but tbh the movie wasnt lackluster at all i usually get bored in movies as long as this but there were plenty of interesting events happening till the climax to keep me hooked and dont even get me started on the ending
Jul 23 2016,negative,i really wanted to like this but didnt the script is mushy the direction is vague and the jokes arent funny not nearly as good as the original  and its not because of the women
Jul 23 2016,negative,only see this movie if you do not have to pay for it and u have nothing better to do
Jul 23 2016,positive,the directors did a great job at keeping the movie loyal to the original but not to the point where it was too similar to the original the humor was at the right amount considering the actresses that played each part great casting choice but dont think it should be a franchise
Jul 23 2016,negative,horrible save your money not even worth a red box
Jul 23 2016,negative,easily the worst movie ive ever sat through
Jul 23 2016,negative,i wasnt expecting a great movie but this movie was awful  i failed to laugh a single time    together there ladies were not funny  bill murray is probably regretting this as much as garfield  save your money and watch the original ghostbusters where you will find a better storyline and better comedians  ghostbusters 2 was even better than this garbage
Jul 23 2016,positive,this was funny was it the original no but i didnt want a rehashed original all the hate this movie is receiving is from people who went in determined to hate it
Jul 23 2016,positive,dont listen to the basement dwelling virgins  this movie has plenty of laughs right out of the gate  all four ladies gave good performances  this movie didnt ruin you childhood whatever your parents did to make you hate women did
Jul 23 2016,negative,half star because i cant go lower i watched the whole movie without even a laugh it is sad that the best lines werent delivered by any of the comedians
Jul 23 2016,positive,is this the ghostbusters follow we have been waiting for does it live up to the first film well you really need to try and see it as it own or you will be disappointed the film on its own is entertaining and funny but it does have a few flaws that bring it down first off though the cast is great kate mckinnon steals the show and chris hemsworth brings laughs all the way through the rest of the main cast is great as well but mckinnon for sure has a overwhelming presence and though she may be the best in my opinion she can still be a little overbearing the plot serves its purpose in bringing our heroes together but honestly isnt anything special the villain is really the worst part because he is just weird in a bad way its not even funny it just comes off as out of place and his whole reason for wanting to destroy the city is because he was bullied and thats it his acting doesnt help at all as it isnt the best the action scenes at the end of the film are awesome and the visuals are fantastic actually the visuals are great throughout i was glad to see that they put forth money to make sure it looked the part overall i enjoyed the film i feel as though i enjoyed it more because i tried to see it as its own film and not a reboot the big disappointment to me was that it throws away all the lore from the first film for the most part it never happened and it kinda sucks that this isnt a actually sequel but as i said it is good on its own accord and you need to go in seeing it that way
Jul 23 2016,negative,very few laughs to be had i went into this with an open mind even though i very much dislike melissa mccarthy and was not particularly thrilled with the rest of the main cast surprisingly i thought melissa mccarthys performance was decent kate mckinnon definitely stole the show the cgi was mediocre the action sequences were a little too over the top and the comedy was near nonexistent the movie tried too hard to stand on the shoulders of its predecessor and utterly failed in that regard the cameos were both bright and dark spots in the movie bright in the sense that it was good as a fan of the originals to see those actors return to the franchisebut sad because they were associated with such a poorly executed reboot
Jul 23 2016,negative,took a classic movie series and added weird casting along with missing the target 30something age groupdoesnt compare at all
Jul 23 2016,negative,unfunny chick flick branded as a ghostbusters film with a sexist feminazi narrative
Jul 23 2016,positive,very happy with this ghostbusters reboot 
Jul 23 2016,positive,this movie could of been cool if old characters played their original characterscould of been greatkind of stupid
Jul 23 2016,negative,it wasnt funny which is a problem for a movie that is supposed to be a comedy
Jul 23 2016,positive,if you are looking for a funny movie to laugh at then go to this a lot of people are getting their panties in a bunch because its a remake and it has an all female cast glad people mostly white men go into this movie with no preconceived biases s sadly theres no talking bear like ted raunchy jokes like hangover or any other bland male dominated movie to relate too hopefully one day woman wont have to face harsher criticism for their work simply because their is an all female cast
Jul 23 2016,positive,it was what i expected
Jul 23 2016,negative,this movie proves you cannot listen to critics  this movie is complete garbage  not funny at all very slap stick and worked way to hard to try to get any sort of laughs falling completely flat  i wanted to like this movie i really did but it is garbage
Jul 23 2016,positive,as a scifi movie i would rate it as a onestar but i wanted to laugh as a comedy it gets 5 stars
Jul 23 2016,negative,an absolute embarrassment of a movie if your time has any value dont waste it here absolute garbage
Jul 23 2016,positive,this movie was awesome they did an even better job than what i expected great add to the series
Jul 23 2016,positive,i loved that this one referenced and honored the original movie without trying to repeat it and the cameos were great i thought the whole movie was hilarious with a few even more exceptional scenes
Jul 23 2016,positive,this is a solidly cast movie that reimagines how the ghostbusters came to be it exists in the same world as the original yet has its own unique storyline with just the right amount of homage to the original   i found the science behind the weapons to fight the ghosts a little lacking but not so much that it suspend my belief feig did an excellent job creating tingling suspense with each ghost encounter kept a solid pace throughout the movie and the story concluded on a high note  leaving me wanting more   beyond that it is an important landmark in film as the female leads dont ever lean on a male lead nor does it pit the female characters against one another it is not a romantic comedy nor a musical and the comedy radiates from the cast they were all wonderful to watch a true team and their performances kept a smile on my face for the entirety of the film even as a reboot it is special sincere and takes on  and holds  a life of its own screwthehaters busttherules
Jul 23 2016,negative,i really wanted to like this movie but it doesnt hold water character motivations and development are flimsy or nonexistent second to techno babble cgi and flat humor the progression feels less like a plot and more a string of random events desperately trying to pad out two hours huntsman and patty are the saving grace this could have been better as a stand alone title if it were done as patty and huntsman ghouls night out
Jul 23 2016,positive,enjoyed it not as good as the original but still solid doesnt deserve all the grief its received
Jul 23 2016,negative,the movie does not understand anything about what made the original special  the original tried to be a serious movie and be believable in its own universe  at no point does this new movie try to be anything other than a bad stereotypical comedy with cheap jokes that do not work
Jul 23 2016,positive,a great remake  great chemistry between the cast  both funnier and scarier than the original  it was refreshing to have the male star chris hemsworth not be the hero of the story and just be a goofy person who made mistakes and still be likeable
Jul 23 2016,positive,funny and smart  loved it  the chemistry between the women is main actors is great  god fun
Jul 23 2016,negative,its a misandrist film never before i have seen men being represent poorly in the history of film
Jul 23 2016,negative,awful dumb horrific movie anyone that thinks otherwise is either paid off or brainless
Jul 23 2016,positive,not perfect but there are funny parts that you will enjoy
Jul 23 2016,negative,there was no magic between the ladies who i happened to enjoy on other projects and chris hemsworth playing the boy toy did not really work out
Jul 23 2016,positive,this is a solidly cast movie that reimagines how the ghostbusters came to be it exists in the same world as the original yet has its own unique storyline with just the right amount of homage to the original   i found the science behind the weapons to fight the ghosts a little lacking but not so much that it suspend my belief feig did an excellent job creating tingling suspense with each ghost encounter kept a solid pace throughout the movie and the story concluded on a high note  leaving me wanting more   beyond that it is an important landmark in film as the female leads dont ever lean on a male lead nor does it pit the female characters against one another it is not a romantic comedy nor a musical and the comedy radiates from the cast they were all wonderful to watch a true team and their performances kept a smile on my face for the entirety of the film  even as a reboot it is special sincere and takes on  and holds  a life of its own screwthehaters busttherules
Jul 23 2016,negative,decent cast performances mildly funny but overall  this is a miss  all the aliens were computer animation i thought that they would do a lot better than that see men in black series
Jul 23 2016,negative,this movie had a few funny moments but was a pale version of the original even the cameos were silly  was not impressed
Jul 23 2016,positive,the new ghostbusters is full of laughs and nods to the original films while remaining refreshing in its own right mckinnon and hemsworth steal the film while mccarthy and wiig offer strong support even though they are technically the leads with great visuals and jokes that arent going to be stuck in 2016 ghostbusters proves the critics wrong and stands easily with the original
Jul 23 2016,negative,random unnecessary reboot that was cringe at most points but admittedly had a few funny jokes and scenes but tried to ride the fame of the previous ghostbusters movie and made awkward references
Jul 23 2016,negative,i had no problem with an all female cast i actually think the movie could have worked great with that cast if writing plot and special effects were not terrible   i wanted it to be good but it just wasnt at all so many distasteful jokes and bad slapstick humor i feel bad for akroyd murray and company i hope this terrible movie doesnt taint the legacy of what ghostbusters used to be
Jul 23 2016,positive,better than they say maybe a 5 if title was different
Jul 23 2016,positive,this was just a really fun movie the trailer wasnt the best representation of the film leaving some of the best jokes and sequences out in order to leave some original content for people to watch without having seen it prior just a really good time well cast and well crafted for a reboot with just the right amount of cheese and harkbacks to the original
Jul 23 2016,negative,total waste of time dont watch it
Jul 23 2016,negative,abysmal an absolute betrayal
Jul 23 2016,positive,a solid summer action comedy  that had to the potential to be amazing but tries too hard to pay homage to original with distractions like forced cameos  i hope to one day see a darker scarier ghostbuster movie  then this cartoonish reboot the laughs are what save this movie so i still recommend it 
Jul 23 2016,negative,a lot of people are saying that this movie is misandric i dont agree with this the film is just plain braindead and not in a funny way i didnt laugh once and feel like i lost a few iq points
Jul 23 2016,positive,judged as a remakereboot the new ghostbusters is not bad at all they have reinvented and nodded appropriately to the originals storyline and structure and the callbacks and cameos are inspired and heartily welcomed by fanboys and girls alike as they are done with sophistication and plenty of charm and affection but judged as a film on its own merits it isnt quite as good or as funny as one would expect from the feigmccarthywiig trifacta leslie jones and kate mckinnon are both great to watch but you cant help but think they could have played it less safe and even looser the end result is a lot of warm nostalgic feelings and more than a few chuckles but missing some big laughoutloud moments  which is not to say i wasnt totally entertained and thrilled because i was and it perfectly fits the bill as a silly summer blockbuster however while it amply proves all the naysayers wrong that the gender of the ghostbusters is irrelevant as long as they are funny the film feels too constricted under the shadow of the original and doesnt generate enough of its own identity and stylings other than swapping the sexes around though chris hemsworth is an inspired choice as the sigourney weaver substitute while i will settle for now this competent origins story rehash and recognizing the potential of these funny ladies by giving them the benefit of the doubt i can only hope that they can free themselves from the shackles of the original film and unleash something even more hilarious and exhilarating the next time round
Jul 23 2016,positive,more funny than i expected it to be
Jul 23 2016,neutral,just boring     all the actresses are known to be funny but what they were given to work with in this film was subpar at best however if the whole movie was about holtzman itd be a 810 or something
Jul 23 2016,positive,this movie really impressed me i was really worried because i was so used to the original but this movie girl power all the way 3
Jul 23 2016,positive,cool fresh new version  enjoyed the shout out to the actors from the original movie
Jul 23 2016,negative,no just no its unfunny and unneeded  4 out of the 5 main cast were really annoying and unlikable dr jillian holtzmann kate mckinnon was the most bearable character but still got irritating
Jul 23 2016,negative,saw it todayit didnt have the same magic as the original chris hemsworths character was poorly implemented  completely unnecessary
Jul 23 2016,positive,movie was amazing i went in with somewhat low expectations and was blown away witty relevant and even a little spooky at times beautiful cg effects it paid homage to the original but didnt take itself too seriously the cameos were fun and didnt come off at all feminist like some reviewers imply i found a little role reversal to be quite entertaining it did drag ever so slightly particularly toward the end but not enough to say any more about it than that
Jul 23 2016,negative,so i actually sat down and watched the new ghostbusters movie and here is my take away thankfully i was able to do so without spending my hard earned money or else id have asked for it back    now the entire movie seemed forced robotic like it was trying way to hard to make you laugh and earn your love like the relative that always gives you a 5 bill when they see you     the backstory bringing together the other three was loose like an infant wearing a pair of my pants loose abby yates melissa mccarthy and erin gilbert kristen wiig apparently had written a book about the paranormal years ago but never published it gilbert was called out for the book while working at columbia university so she goes to confront yates yates is working with a techie jillian holtzmann kate mckinon and they three decide to go team up to go see about a possible ghost sighting the find it slime happens and now they are all friends and going to work together    enter the villain who apparently was bullied as a kid so he has to use ghosts to take his revenge and destroy the people of new york thats all i got from him besides the fact that he probably ate paint chips as a kid because he was the overly stereotypical weirdo type character quoting shakespeare and trying to act all suave when interacting with the main characters    the set up shop above a chinese restaurant because cost and hire the most moronic male character ever as their receptionist and low and behold the 4th member of their team shows up after seeing a ghost in the subway tunnels now i do want to point out one of my three likeable parts is right herethe only character that honestly seemed to have been written well and portrayed great was patty tolan portrayed by leslie jones even with her horrendous scene of slapping a ghost out of another ghostbuster her character was the only one that didnt seem forced into the plot im not saying that the rest of the actors in the film acted badly im saying their characters were written horribly and it showed in their portrayals    they test out their stuff get a car from tolans fightcapture a ghost in public and apparently the mayor of new york and the nsa have been secretly watching the situation and while they thank them in private they arrest and call them frauds in public     they take it upon themselves to find and confront the villain and he kills himself in the middle of the basementlab he has set at a hotel that sits on laylines again arrested and called frauds in public but thanked in private before the villains ghost comes back and you get the slapping scene then it takes over hemsworth and goes to the hotel to unleash evil so the ghostbuster slip into action with proton gauntlets pistols grenades and its an actual fight scene where they are tearing through the ghosts and somehow just destroying them with their gear on the way to the fight you get aykroyds cameo which was enjoyable you also see slimer steel ecto1 and the stay puffed marshmellow man is a a parade float taken out with a swiss army knife     meanwhile the posses hemsworth is able to control the national guard hundreds of them btw as puppets and makes them strike a disco pose the ghostbuster show up and he asks what form they want him to take so they say cute and cuddly so he becomes their logo and grows to sky scraper heights the realize to close the portal they can detonate a nuke inside of it so they get ecto1 driven into it and blow up the nuke on its roof standard equipment all ghosts are sucked into the underworld and the city is saved    again publicly called frauds but privately thanked and funded they get the fire station now they retain their receptionist for no reason even after he tries to take credit with them for the hard work and the movie ends with 5 small cut scenes and an end scene enter my lastly enjoyed part was sigorney weavers cameo was funny and that character seemed more well thought and written than the three main characters on and the last scene while listen to white noise patty asked is anyone knows who zule is a sad sad attempt to try and market a sequel already    overall this was garbage the 5 different renditions of the ghostbusters song played throughout the movie were ear sores the uniformed looked like shit and the equipment as well dont get me started on ecto1 and the graphics while okay were no better than those from the original movies if not worse    i hope ghostbusters gets a proper and well written reboot in the future and we can forget about this 116 minute piece of trash forever
Jul 23 2016,negative,honestly i found this film unfunny boring often and alot of stereo typed or racist overtones
Jul 23 2016,positive,this movie made me scream and laugh outloud i loved it i really dont understand the people hating on it ill watch it again and again through the years like ive done with the first two gb movies
Jul 23 2016,negative,as boring as the original
Jul 23 2016,positive,i wasnt sure what to expect but i totally enjoyed this movie it is quirky and gasp an all women cast but enjoyed every minute
Jul 23 2016,neutral,very funny in places  kate mckinnon was absolutely hilarious     she could play tank girl if there is ever a reboot    the cast did a great job cameos were short  sweet  werent overdone  effects were pretty cool and the macys parade was a nice touch along with a couple of other easter eggs    the ending ugh the dive into the vortex was cheesy  ruined the entire thing for me i gave this 25 stars because i genuinely laughed hard in certain parts mainly at the dialog i never cracked up once during the first ghostbusters even though i am a fan of that film    wasnt terrible but again the ending was too over the top all of the hoopla aside its definitely better than ghostbusters 2
Jul 22 2016,negative,if you loved this movie then try and remember 1 funny quote
Jul 22 2016,negative,they shouldve paid me to go see this movie was boring never picked up or got any better calling this a tribute to the original is an insult
Jul 22 2016,positive,this was a great movie it was funny  just gowatch and enjoy  absolutely loved it
Jul 22 2016,positive,very funny  these ladies did an incredible job reinnovating a classic with a whole new twist  it was wonderful to see strong female protagonists  the characters were funny without putting themselves or each other down for laughs  great casting choices and special effects have come a long way since the last ghostbuster movie
Jul 22 2016,positive,my whole family loved this movie this is the first live action film she truly lived and she saw the new star wars she liked it but she went crazy for ghostbusters she now wants to be a ghostbuster when she grows up
Jul 22 2016,neutral,the film starts out good but seems to be rather rushed the attempts at humor were rather bland and there was very little feeling of suspense when compared to the original movie all eye candy and little substance basically i think the film is probably somewhere between mediocre and it sucked
Jul 22 2016,negative,first off i love the first two movies however i did not really appreciate this new tacky version i felt many of the jokes were cheesy and lacked humor the plot and script should have been worked on more i truly wanted to fall in love with this movie but the only thing it had going for it was the cool effects not to mention the only funny parts in the movie were also in the trailer not much can be said about a movie when its whole content can be viewed in two minutes
Jul 22 2016,positive,fun isnt that what a summer flick is supposed to be the movies strength is that it isnt a wordforword rehash of the original plot the humor is a mixed bag of slapstick situational and snide remarks people love chris hemsworths dumb character but that was just a small portion of the humor palette the villain and his parallel social standing to the main heroes is well thoughtout without it being too much of a spoiler they treat him with understanding at first which is a strangely sober but smart moment in this version i enjoyed how they knew when to use their leslie jones while a favorite of mine i understand she can be a bit much we showed our son the original and this one and he liked both for different reasons if an eight year old can appreciate both for different reasons anyone can consider this a separate work from the original also the theater we attended serves alcohol just saying go enjoy it for a few laughs there are way worse ways to spend a 10 ticket
Jul 22 2016,negative,copied the first one not very creative some cool effects and definitely some funny parts could have been way better     kind of felt like a bunch of unrelated sketches but not a cohesive movie
Jul 22 2016,negative,fail total dismal failure hollywood truly has no respect for the people or idiots in their minds who spend their money on tickets if you want to watch it because you enjoyed the originaldont if you want to watch it anywaystream it a bad cam recording will do
Jul 22 2016,neutral,really wanted to like this movie all these comedians are great just not in this movie
Jul 22 2016,positive,absolutely hilarious the cast works beautifully to create something new while paying homage to the original
Jul 22 2016,negative,i was sad watching it the writing was straightup bad the directing was mediocre you could tell the actors trying to make up for the poor creative leadership paul feig really wasted this opportunity the ghostbusters team had little chemistry it seemed like a film that went into production without a script and they did their best to make it up as they went along
Jul 22 2016,negative,complete garbage i was drunk and still appalled by this movie
Jul 22 2016,positive,dont compare this to the 80s franchise its new hip and fresh in its own way i laughed my butt off and enjoyed it as a fun silly movie
Jul 22 2016,positive,loved all the woman empowerment and role reversal chris hemsworth as the dumb blonde girl kate mckinon as the love of my life its waaaay better than the original great stand alone great comedy gonna see it again
Jul 22 2016,positive,fun movie even gave us good jumps references the original but stands on its own would see again excellent
Jul 22 2016,negative,well  it could not ruin the brilliance of the first movie  it was rotten  good effects and actresses  just badly badly imagined 
Jul 22 2016,positive,it was a lot of fun and funny if you can see it see it in 3d it is one of the best 3d movies i have ever seen i love the original movies and this one
Jul 22 2016,positive,so good    ghostbusters 
Jul 22 2016,negative,terrible movie not funny   my friends and i couldnt wait for it to be over
Jul 22 2016,positive,for me it was as entertaining as the original a solid comedy with some decent laughs
Jul 22 2016,positive,lots of laughs and fun basically a remake  the gals pulled it off  great cameos from the original cast  was produced by dan ackroyd and ivan reitman who made the original
Jul 22 2016,neutral,ghostbusters is lackluster and the jokes are unfunny and forced i rate movies on the following criteria  5 great will see multiple times in theater  4 good entertaining worth the time to see at a theater  3 if i saw it at the theater i wouldnt regret it but i would recommend to friends wait for the dvd  2 definitely wait for the dvd and probably only watch if nothing else is on that night  1 it was so bad a 150 red box rental makes me feel ripped off   the ghostbusters remake is a middle of the road just ok attempt at ghostbusters if this was a stand alone movie without the ghostbusters franchise behind it it wouldnt be recommended by anyone
Jul 22 2016,negative,i really wanted to like ghost busters 2016 after hearing the luke warmgood reviews from friends and critics there obviously were some really funny moments ie chris hemsworth and kate mckinnon scenes but i have to say most of these funny moments did more to hurt the overall film than help it it felt like an extended ghostbusters themed snl sketch  my biggest criticism is the film was extremely overwritten with jokes its almost as if they were afraid to allow the viewer to settle into the plot and actually be afraid of ghosts this truly did not feel like a ghostbusters film as jenny lorenzo put it it felt like brides maids with proton packs every time we went into a chris hemsworth is dumb sequence it felt like they were breaking from the plot and characters for a quick comedy sketch and then went right back to the movie even the dog named mike hat gag seemed like a random out of place whose on first sketch injected in the middle of a normal scene yes it was funny but did we really need to have that there this sort of writing made the pacing feel all over the place  the thing about the original ghostbusters and i would even argue the lackluster sequel is it was not just a comedy there are genuinely scary scenes throughout both original ghostbuster films that raise the stakes and keep the viewer invested in the outcome with some welcome comedy relief from our heroes to string it together some of these genuinely scary scenes include the opening scene with the librarian who encounters the first ghost of the film dana putting away the groceries where the eggs start to boil themselves on the kitchen counter the arm chair coming to life and abducting dana and even rick moranis being chased by the gargoyle leaned more heavily on horror than comedy  if you took out all of the jokes of ghostbusters 1984 you would still have a genuinely scary film however if you take away the jokes of ghostbusters 2016 there is no movie there were no genuinely scary moments of this film because it was written soley as a rapidfire comedy not a ghostbuster film my beef with this film is more a beef with the state of main stream comedies that are written today heavy on the quick paced jokes light on the plot and character development and then people leave the theatre and remember how often they laughed so they round up and say it was a good movie ghostbusters 2016 lacked the attention to the movie part of the movie and instead focussed on an add comedy experience hoping it would pass as an entry in the ghostbusters franchise im all for women leading films and this film had great potential with the talent involved but this is not the film to celebrate this didnt ruin my childhood but it ruined an opportunity to make a truly smart and funny film to revitalize the ghostbusters universe
Jul 22 2016,positive,im not sure what people are yapping about  this was a witty fun and well acted movie by all
Jul 22 2016,positive,i  thought this was really fun no its not especially ground breaking but it was fun and it gave me an opportunity to connect with my boyfriends children i thought all the ladies were funny and cute but kate mckinnon stole the show i loved it its been making me smile for days
Jul 22 2016,positive,not every joke landed and the third act felt a bit rushed but i had a big stupid grin on my face the entire time i felt like a kid seeing men in black or batman for the first time again i loved it
Jul 22 2016,negative,big budget knock off of the real thing not a reboot and not a sequel its the equivalent of  putting the bag from a shreddies box into a golden grams box and trying to pawn it off to your kids that its sugar cereal just because it has a ghostbusters logo on it and the actresses are sporting proton packs does not make it ghostbusters movie even if it were a reboot you cant go and rewrite the mythos of the source material this film should have started with the words in an alternative ghostbusters reality there lived 4 women scientists  if youre a true real fan stay away
Jul 22 2016,negative,pure garbage terrible writing an embarrassment to the franchise
Jul 22 2016,positive,i loved the original ghostbusters watched it as a kid and it has been a firm favorite since  i really think this movie might have been better than it though so i am both sad and angry that it has received so much hate  the story was probably a bit better than the original and i really liked the cast  i think patty was especially great really fabulous delivery  the cameos were also fun and definitely stay for all the credits which were really entertaining start to finish
Jul 22 2016,positive,great and funny movie 
Jul 22 2016,negative,worst movie of 2016
Jul 22 2016,positive,loved every minute of it
Jul 22 2016,positive,we all loved it it was laugh out loud funny light horror
Jul 22 2016,positive,im excited to see at 940
Jul 22 2016,positive,despite the bad reviews this movie has been given i actually loved it it took the original ghostbusters movie and put a nice twist to it  the visual effects could have been better but that doesnt make it awful it was a funny movie that i really enjoyed
Jul 22 2016,positive,great movie the haters are just wrong funny and different
Jul 22 2016,positive,really fun movie that tips its hat to the original
Jul 22 2016,positive,love it some very funny ladies
Jul 22 2016,positive,loved it hilarious fun and great to see women in comedic roles the best comedians of today the ghosts looked awesome there was action comedy and chris hemsworth what more could you want
Jul 22 2016,positive,i have to say the criticism regarding this movie should be put to rest i thought it was funny and the cameos of some of the original cast members were well placed some will find it bold and refreshing and others will find it down right blasphemous    personally ive never been a huge fan of movies of remakes but i thought this had some funny moments with the new cast members for a lot of critics internet trolls warped perverted misogynists it seems like its the movie that everyone wants to hate for those want to see it do it you will enjoy it at least i did for those that dont want see it thats fine it may not be the movie for you    but i will say that movie will inspire a form of cosplay this year and i can see a lot of people having a whole lot of fun with it
Jul 22 2016,negative,you put on any film for me to see and i will gladly watch it and analyze it etc     this film made me start to get sleepy and no im not saying it bc of its all females cast even if they were trying way too hard to be badasses
Jul 22 2016,positive,while it does not justify the need for the reboot in the first place ghostbusters caught me off guard as to how a silly and goofy summer blockbuster can still be so enjoyable and fun but hoping for no sequels as this is the best they can do with our day and age
Jul 22 2016,negative,this movie is just bad and not for any reason related to what kind of junk the leads have in their pants just plain old boring formulaic processed uninspired typical hollywood remake garbage the gender war is just an overblown controversy exploited by the studio to distract you from how mindnumbingingly blasé this is simply put its not a movie its a product not painful to consume but it will immediately pass on from your brain afterward unlike the hackneyed cgi spirits overflowing on the screen
Jul 22 2016,negative,this movie gave me aids and i died i literally died these are my last words fuc you movie
Jul 22 2016,positive,super funny not really sure why everyone was hating on it especially before it even came out
Jul 22 2016,positive,did not disappoint so funny and great to finally see women get a chance to shine in a classic reboot
Jul 22 2016,positive,after reading so many reviews that were obviously written by people who hadnt actually seen the movie i felt compelled to throw in my two cents     this was a smart funny adventurecomedy it gave tribute to the original but never felt beholden to it they created something new for themselves the villian was also interesting  someone who was sympathetic and a lot like our heroes but had chosen a different path express his frustration and finally yes  it was so refreshing to see four women playing roles that werent genderspecific     if four guys had been cast i would have laughed just as much and these same idiots would be sneering at the women who asked why girls always have to be the secretary so i guess haters gonna hate but its their loss  theyre missing out on a great movie
Jul 22 2016,negative,kid movie with a lot of the same jokes youve seen again and again
Jul 22 2016,positive,pretty witty and clever for a classic remake
Jul 22 2016,negative,this is an abomination the legacy of one of my favorite childhood movies has been destroyed by radical hollywood leftists pandering to the insane 3rd wave feminists of today leslie jones caused a media spectacle over hate mailtweets despite a her string of racially charged tweets in the past the hypocracy is palpable    the far left agenda of the cast and crew leaves me speechless
Jul 22 2016,positive,story 710 characters 610 interactions 910 gameplay 1010 editing 1010 winner 710 satisfaction 910 humor 510 quality 910 suspense 1010 total 82100 final rank great 
Jul 22 2016,negative,terrible not even a little bit funny just made me very pissed off
Jul 22 2016,positive,i dont know what all the hate is about i laughed out loud i probably liked it best out of the three ghostbusters movies i saw the first one as a kid in movie theaters so i get the nostalgia but i dont get why people hate on the actors and the movie i hope they make a fourth one
Jul 22 2016,positive,ive never seen a movie before with this many female lead characters where there is never a fight over a boy never any jokes made about weight or appearance whatsoever and next to 0 misogyny genuinely genius ive never left a movie theater grinning as widely as i did today good job ghostbusters im really really impressed  an avid ghostbusters fan since 2000
Jul 22 2016,positive,very fun movie that was enjoyable  the 4 women all rocked
Jul 22 2016,positive,as a fan of the original its so great to see something i liked remade along with taking away some of the sexist themes that went with the older ones its getting so much sexist hate but its really funny and you really shouldnt dismiss it because of its current rating go see this movie its great
Jul 22 2016,negative,so incredibly stupid dialogue was terrible actresses totally lame plot brain numbingly unoriginal a disgrace to the original film
Jul 22 2016,neutral,i had heard a lot of noise about how this movie was evil etc but i liked it  while it followed some of the old plot it was mostly all new  the characters were interesting and funny most of the time  i would say it wasnt better than the original but it was ok  also i like what they did on the credits by splicing in clips so you wanted to stick around  if you are going to show 5 minutes of credits and expect people to watch you should at least entertain us  i hope more movies start doing this
Jul 22 2016,negative,this movie was total crap but apparently people are afraid of speaking the truth
Jul 22 2016,negative,still waiting on the punchline     not the worst movie ive ever watched but i found myself getting that cringe feeling for most of the stuff they passed as jokes    the choreography was inconsistent people were doing what they felt like doing in reaction to cg events the cg itself was really bad i mean there was an immediate suspension of belief for me    check it out you may like it just writing my impression
Jul 22 2016,positive,best comedy movie ever  to all people who said this movie suckstwo middle finger to you
Jul 22 2016,negative,great cast not funny
Jul 22 2016,positive,i had no idea what to expect i saw no previews i guess my expectations were lower than i realized because this blew me away though jones sometimes annoys me on snl she was perfect in this role the often obnoxious mccarthy was a fantastic nerdy scientist wigg was funny and nerdy in a totally different way mckinnon was a positively genius gadgetguy and was my favorite character hemsworth was too funny as the pretty dumb guy   the cameos and nods to the original were just enough to make me chuckle but not so much that it pulled away from the plot  i think this is my new favorite movie
Jul 22 2016,positive,not as awful as expected quite decent in places
Jul 22 2016,negative,could have been so much better if they used the original cast cameos as actual original characters and continues as the girls were the next generation of the team seeing the original cast as bit part cameos just made me angry so wished i waited till the hit netflix and save my money kate mckinnon was the best part of the whole film chris hemsworth was one of the worst parts
Jul 22 2016,positive,fantastic  funny and very entertaining
Jul 22 2016,positive,this movie was downright hysterical  loved every minute and every joke of it  the cameos are great the special effects are killer and its just all around awesome fun it is what a movie should be
Jul 22 2016,negative,paul feig should stop making movies this is only the fourth movie ive ever walked out of its supposed to be a reboot but was spaceballs to star wars utter crap
Jul 22 2016,positive,this movie had a lot to live up to with the first ghostbusters i genuinely like paul fiegs films so this definitely was on my radar the cast all have worked together in some form so they all gel together nicely but no one overshadows anyone the cgi was a lot better than i expected and the movie was funny there were a lot of jokes when it hit it hit hard when it didnt hit it was super unfunny the villain on the other hand does not fit in and isnt remotely funny they are really pushing feminism with this movie with every male an idiot or a ass and the woman superior in everything im fine with feminism and all but dont constantly throw it in our face the action scenes where pretty cool and overall i was satisfied  70100
Jul 22 2016,negative,callbacks and a mostly unfunny script wish i had watched the original one again instead of this
Jul 22 2016,positive,hilarious when it was trying to be and good action as well
Jul 22 2016,positive,fun new take with just enough of the old to honor the originals
Jul 22 2016,positive,people arent afraid of ghosts but they seem to be afraid of an all female cast taking on an 80s classic this is a fun and fresh reimaging with enough quirkiness ghouls and the odd cameo to entertain both fans of old and new alike go and see it and dont be afraid to enjoy it
Jul 22 2016,negative,skip it not funny and way too much violence
Jul 22 2016,positive,being a fan of the original ghostbusters i was a bit worried about this movie i was sold on this movie after the opening scene  it was well done and most of the cameos were well done     im glad i finally have a move to make me forget about ghostbusters 2
Jul 22 2016,negative,good movie is you want to sleep early or if you need to throw up
Jul 22 2016,negative,total crap bad acting and not funny i wouldnt even subject my worst enemy to this drivel
Jul 22 2016,positive,great remake leslie jones and chris hemsworth steal the movie
Jul 22 2016,negative,total garbage from start to finish give up on the sexist misogynist bullcrap no ones interested and no one cares feminist propaganda has no place in movies if you have an agenda do it in the appropriate place not with a franchise that is loved by all
Jul 22 2016,negative,very blah movie only 2 scenes that were lol funny too much blah to recommend seeing this movie in theaters
Jul 22 2016,positive,i love this movie put it on facebook please
Jul 22 2016,negative,pretty much what i thought it was going to be from seeing the trailers this movie had potential to be a good film had it been a sequel and not a reboot ghostbusters 2016 is an absolute disgrace to the franchise watch the originals over this pile of hot garbage
Jul 22 2016,negative,really not funny its like they took the original films and shat all over them who ever thought that they could do that needs a slap
Jul 22 2016,positive,an all female gang of ghoul trappers melissa mccarthy kristen wigg kate mckinnon and leslie jones star in this likeable reboot that has great affection for the original    the plot is similar to the first movie  when theres a spate of paranormal goingson across new york city our ragtag group of spook hunters join forces to save the city from a ghostly armageddon    mckinnon puts in an hilariously unrestrained performance as a goofy nerdy but totally badass physicist jones also shines in a similar outsized performance as a subway worker and big apple history buff wiigs professor and mccarthys paranormal investigator who have both been comedic scene stealers in other films are in contrast subdued as two estranged friends reunited    chris hemsworth who plays an unbelievably incompetent receptionist the ghostbusters hire puts in a great turn and is clearly having a lot of fun in a twist on the dumb blonde secretary original lead cast members of the beloved supernatural comedy bill murray dan ackroyd ernie hudson and sigourney weaver are all on hand for cameos    ghostbusters is a lively funny crowd pleaser which barrows plenty of plot specifics from the original film but with enough new material to keep the story surprising with its own scares
Jul 22 2016,negative,save your money no chemistry bad scriptsad
Jul 22 2016,negative,only twice in my life have i walked out of a movie this was the second so disappointing because id been looking forward to it truthfully id been looking forward to the original ghostbusters whereas the original left me breathless with spectacular fx and witty dialogue this one barely breathes at all sad drivel equals rapid exit   barely breathed sanity
Jul 22 2016,positive,fantastic  the gender swapped roles are irrelevant unless youre a sexist so get over that and appreciate holtzmann if you only like to stare at men on the big screen chris hemsworth shows he has potential as a comedic actor great film
Jul 22 2016,negative,worst movie i have seen just a joke compared to any other ghostbusters
Jul 22 2016,negative,this film blows  uninspired and pales by a huge margin in comparison to the original and is even worse than gb2  the so called humor is virtually nonexistent with few exceptions  if you have to see this film i suggest waiting for it to come to television as it is not worth paying to see
Jul 22 2016,positive,this movie was great gives the original one a run for its money  im not a big melissa mccarthy fan but really did enjoy her in this movie  definitely recommend seeing this movie
Jul 22 2016,negative,my wife and i have not been so disappointed in a movie in a long time
Jul 22 2016,negative,the movie sucked donkey balls everyones just too scared to piss off the feminists to say it cause it wasnt just women that made this movie it was feminists and its just so easy to tell and theres nothing that they can ever touch that doesnt become awful unfunny cancer wow shooting someone in the ballsreal cleaver gals  same thing with the shit your own pants gag they actually dwell on that throughout the movie unbearable
Jul 22 2016,neutral,disappointing bland film mckinnon was fun and the rest felt forced dont even remember the original so no comparisons here the film didnt know what it wanted to be so wasnt funny enough nor actionfilled excitementnor enough drama story was jarring in its tonejust mixed up watch it if  i dunnolet me know when you find a reason  i suppose im a sexist now 
Jul 22 2016,positive,because science is hilariousand so are the actors  jokes in this movie go see it so much fun xoxoxo
Jul 22 2016,positive,funny fun the four great comic actresses do not disappoint also several great cameos and guest roles better than many remakes that have come out over the past few years there is nothing in this film to merit the misogynist online hatrid
Jul 22 2016,positive,actually really good
Jul 22 2016,positive,it certainly wasnt as groundbreaking as the original but its a solid effort as a tweaked sequel thats hilarious in parts while being familyfriendly the effects were well done and the performances were spoton kate mckinnon can be too weird on snl but stole the movie with arguably the best performance i do wish they had done something different with hemsworth and jones characters jones was too much of a stereotype and hemsworth should have been either more dumb and naive or quiet and awkward as it was hemsworth just came across and selfinvolved and undermining but i completely disagree with the reviews that refer to manhating in the film this is just a lazy way of saying there were more female than male leads i also disagree with it seeming like a 2hour snl sketch just because there were several snl actorswriters involved
Jul 22 2016,negative,i go to movies to be entertained and always hope for the best since ive already spent my money  big disappointment
Jul 22 2016,positive,i liked the allfemale cast and thought it was well cast i thought it was on par with the original
Jul 22 2016,positive,who the fuck cares if there is cgi it doesnt matter when the movie is continuously making you laugh its corny in all the right way and these girls are amazing actresses there are so many cameos and it sticks to the snl feel of comedy if youre looking for the old ghostbusters than walk away from this film if you are looking for a movie to laugh your face off to then youre in the right place
Jul 22 2016,positive,excellent and far better than trailers would suggest  amazing casting and fantastic writing if you are a true ghostbusters fan then you will not want to miss this  hilarious and true to the source material
Jul 22 2016,positive,its 2040 our president is a plant  xd
Jul 22 2016,positive,it was very funny im a hardcore ghostbusters fan since i was a kid and i think it holds up to the originals way better then ghostbusters 2 my only complaint was there were too many nods to the original which at times slowed down the movie and some hokey gagsthe post credit scene tho had me jumping out of my chair in excitement i really liked the 3d  aspect of the movie a lot of times they didnt use the 3d but when they did he werent expecting it so i gave you an extra jump out of your chair which added that whore aspect like the risk jeana which added that whore aspect like the original
Jul 22 2016,negative,what a load of garbage jokes are unfunny and no synergy between the cast members  male actors are made out to be morons just a chick flick i hope it flops
Jul 22 2016,negative,this was the worst movie i have seen in a long time
Jul 22 2016,negative,god awful the film is nothing but bad joke after another and none of them are really funny
Jul 22 2016,positive,i loved it it was funny it was cute cant wait to own it
Jul 22 2016,negative,not a rubbish but nope
Jul 22 2016,positive,loved the movie just as good if not better than the original
Jul 22 2016,positive,while i still liked the old ghostbusters better i have to admit i laughed more at this one and there were some really priceless and unexpected cameos in this
Jul 22 2016,positive,loved it i liked the references to the original ghostbusters but this movie stands on its own
Jul 22 2016,negative,meh i wont waste my time watching it again
Jul 22 2016,negative,treat this film for what it really isan extremely bad parody movie
Jul 22 2016,negative,i didnt laugh once i smiled at one of the jokes
Jul 22 2016,positive,made the original proud girlpower
Jul 22 2016,negative,somewhat boring plot mixed with terrible pacing ghostbusters fails to live up to the original and replaces the fun of catching ghosts with talking heads and boring dialogue
Jul 22 2016,negative,endless bad jokes rushed script and poorly cast  nothing new to see here  whats with the soup being a repeated point in the film  save your money and rewatch the original
Jul 22 2016,positive,the first 30 minutes are actually really good and suspenseful for the next 75 minutes the humor becomes mostly forced and the story becomes repetitive kate mckinnon was a bright spot throughout the darkness and the silly dance number at the end is chuckleable
Jul 22 2016,negative,was not that funny the script was bad and was no where as good as the original dont make another one please
Jul 22 2016,positive,awesome movie everyone has to see this hilarious and honors the originals
Jul 22 2016,negative,theres almost nothing worth seeing here i didnt laugh i wasnt amazed i wasnt excited for anything in the whole movie
Jul 22 2016,negative,a movie consisting of nonstop 1liners that never seem to land all culminating in a ghost dick joke
Jul 22 2016,negative,sad really sad that another installment didnt make this franchise better it just made it worse 
Jul 22 2016,negative,why does hollywood continue to make crappy knockoffs of really good movies left feeling i wasted my time and money all these ladies are funny stand up comedians but it doesnt translate to the big screen in my opinion
Jul 22 2016,positive,great movie better than the 1st funny great cameos and ghosts are awesomemovie is good dont listen to the haters
Jul 22 2016,positive,melissa mccarthy did a great job i think harold ramis would be proud
Jul 22 2016,negative,a few good jokes and a great mckinnon performance besides that the movie was just not that good
Jul 22 2016,positive,really enjoyed this movie  there was some subtle jokes that i just loved
Jul 22 2016,positive,ghostbusters was hilarious i went in to the movie with kind of low expectations to be honestbut i found myself laughing throughout pretty much the entire movie kate mckinnon was definitely the scene stealer and the cameos were perfect definitely give this movie an atoo bad for all the negative hype leading up to it all those lame angry fanboys are missing out
Jul 22 2016,positive,campy and fun as expected end felt rushed good characters worth a watch
Jul 22 2016,positive,really liked the team really liked the girls the humour the end suffers from that third act massive action like so many movies but very fun overall
Jul 22 2016,negative,god awful this not only pales in comparison to the original its a poor excuse for a comedy in general my only explanation for this failing with all the talent behind the actresses and director is that they just didnt revere the movie as true fans do if they had they would not have signed on with such a horrible script i gave this an honest chance to stand on its own but to no avail they attempted to ride the originals coat tails by hitting the same beats and even failed doing that zero originality from what i could see this was purely a girls rule film that made a point to stick it to all men everywhere shame they blew a golden opportunity to please true fans
Jul 22 2016,negative,worst film so far this century
Jul 22 2016,negative,took my kids to see it  i had set my expectations low but apparently not low enough  wait for this to come out on video and thendont rent it pew
Jul 22 2016,negative,not well made at all none of the characters were very realistic but overblown versions i loved winston in the original he was an everyday regular dude looking for a job patty was a loud obnoxious and not very funny comedy relief skip the theaters this movie will be out in redbox in a few months
Jul 22 2016,negative,this movie is so bad  rotten tomatoes only rated this high because they are a bunch of feminazies
Jul 22 2016,positive,it wasnt as great as i expected it to be but it made me laugh and have a nice time so 45
Jul 22 2016,positive,you can read my tweet thread review of it here 
Jul 22 2016,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed it laughing hard in many instances and finding myself entertained by how it went against stereotypes and presented a wellflowing movie i would have liked some better character development and a more menacing villain but overall just a lot of fun
Jul 22 2016,negative,no stop remaking gold into fools gold
Jul 22 2016,negative,quite possibly the worst movie put out in the last several years a politically motivated drab that cares more about fitting into the cultural left fringe than being what the audience wants to see you seriously attempted to turn thor into a benevolent rambling idiot shame on you chris you sold out to the left
Jul 22 2016,positive,good revival of the ghostbusters franchise i actually enjoyed the characters and the actors in the film the only negative was probably the storyline it was a big drawn out but the actors made it much better it isnt meant to be a serious movie so dry and laugh out loud humor is a must which they delivered on quite well my kids who have seen the originals several times enjoyed the movie a lot worth seeing in the theatre and owning
Jul 22 2016,positive,this was an absolutely funny movie dont compare it to the original that would be stupid
Jul 22 2016,positive,this film was a lot funnier than i thought it would be  the collage of characters was great especially kevin and holtzmann  the film started out strong but then lost my interest a bit near the end  it would have been better if it was about 15 minutes shorter  this was a good reboot with plenty of cameos and references to the original while still being its own thing
Jul 22 2016,negative,total crap  bad story bad jokes which felt like they were on a timer to see how many they could get out in the movie the 3 good jokes were giggly worthy but nothing more  every single character was an idiot chris hems worths character was a total moron  everyother character was stereotypical this franchise has been dead and needs to stay dead
Jul 22 2016,positive,loved this movie as did everyone in the cinema it was funny and a lovely family movie its not going to be an oscar winner but as far as family films go its great dont know why people are slating it
Jul 22 2016,negative,rofl this was one of the worst memories of recent time i hope it goes away by the way i am a women
Jul 22 2016,positive,derivative as expected but still somewhat interesting  unfortunately a not as bad as expected isnt good enough  the all female lead is interesting and the director kept melissa mccarthy from hamming it up too much  the cameos are excellent  see this one in 3d otherwise its very missable
Jul 22 2016,positive,a fun family film that is light on plot but strong on characters it uses many of the same concepts from the original but stands on its own
Jul 22 2016,negative,absolute garbage theirs no other way to put it unless your a sjw or crazed feminist then omg its like to totally  the best thing ever
Jul 22 2016,negative,have you seen an adam sandler movie that came out in the last 2 years thats the kind of comedy it has
Jul 22 2016,positive,exactly what i want from a buddy comedy ghost movie  which is a hard genre to get right
Jul 22 2016,positive,absolutely a new favourite for me hilarious well written great story and casting go see this movie
Jul 22 2016,negative,complete and utter trash
Jul 22 2016,positive,legitimately laugh out loud funny in places its not likely to become a classic like the original but it was definitely a fun way to spend a sunday afternoon and id totally watch it again
Jul 22 2016,negative,barely funny effects look god awful no cast chemistry definitly paul fiegs worst movie the only good thing to come out of this movie is ecto cooler being rereleased
Jul 22 2016,positive,i saw the original ghostbusters when i was home sick with chickenpox i was 9 i loved it then still love it now and i loved this reimagining of it too no childhood ruined here if you can handle reboots of other films you can handle this as expected this is nowhere near deserving of the hate its been getting    i really dislike that i cant talk about this movie and without addressing gender politics thing i dont get to just talk about this like any other movie or reboot for that matter i dont have to have this sort of conversation with star trek or robocop or a nightmare on elm street the ones that tell good stories and do their job well do well and the ones that are just crappy movies are crappy movies the fact that the entire cast is men or mostly men is of course never the problem    representation matters people and as much as i love the original film it was damn great to see a bunch of smart ladies catching some ghosts there were no booty shots or random sex scenes there was no competition between the other women for anything they all got to kick ass they knew their stuff they wore practical clothing  they got to eat without some sort of crack being made about weight or dieting or some crap thats how low the bar is sometimes as a woman watching movies with women in it    which brings me to kevin the receptionist character there is a heaping amount of whining about kevin being brainless and only existing for eye candy purposes deal with it its a flip of the usual run of things when its a dumb female receptionist if you cant handle it boys thats too bad and i have no sympathy for you mr hemsworth however seems to be having a blast     the women all work well together the chemistry is great and they are not direct copies of the original team yes you can tell which male ghostbuster theyre modelled after but they are not copies there are a lot sometimes too many of winks and nods to the original but its all in all a fun fun movie the cameos were fab and i really should write an essay analysing a particular destruction of a particular beloved icon corrupted but recognizable in the final act i was smirking hardcore at that     the effects sometimes take over a bit too much but when you contrast the effects against a film made in the 80s its going to look a bit heavy handed in comparison anyway and i didnt have too many issues plot wise with it there was one moment where i was confused how all the characters knew something i was pretty sure only one character knew but again thats nitpicking and yeah there are few jokes that didnt work as well as they could have but theres always one or two in every comedy film     these were real people real educated people doing a thing they believed in and kicking butt at it i drove home blasting the original and cover version of the ghostbusters theme tune on loop with the windows down on the highway all the way home sign me up for more please    if the movie isnt for you it isnt for you there are certain movies that definitely arent for me whether because im not the intended audience or i just didnt like it but i can be an adult about it     also this film really isnt for me either i mean yeah it is but who its really for is the 8 year old girl dancing in the row in front of me during the end credits
Jul 22 2016,negative,meh  really lacked the magic and chemistry of the original
Jul 22 2016,positive,really loved it  such great fun  i frankly liked it much more than the original
Jul 22 2016,negative,didnt like the pc bs being rammed down my throat
Jul 22 2016,negative,as predicted by many this film is awful very badly cast with one dimensional characters and no chemistry what doesnt help is the extremely bad plot and script which is very muddled and jumps from scene to scene with no time for character development which made the original film such a classic hopefully we will not see a follow up of this mess and it is quickly forgotten so when ghostbusters is mentioned the public have good things to say once again
Jul 22 2016,negative,horrible nasty feminist film of the worst kind the entire film is about making women look good and hating men its so agenda driven its embarrassing to watch its unfunny boring and i cannot believe the good reviews on here are genuine
Jul 22 2016,positive,it was fun but not a great start to a reboot this film wasnt scary but it had its moments of comedy kate mckinnon was awesome as always
Jul 22 2016,positive,didnt wanna go but my cranial reticulated flying skateboard flux capacitor dragged me in
Jul 22 2016,positive,holy shit this movie has changed my life and i am just so grateful that it was made
Jul 22 2016,positive,if you enjoy the original ghostbusters for the comedy aspect alone this movie recites the whacky humour presented throughout the 80s however if you thought that the original was average then this reboot is a bundle of joy a light to all those lesser fans
Jul 22 2016,negative,what the hell was this shame on paul fieg
Jul 22 2016,positive,defiantly not chris  hemsworths best performance his roll was not well casted some of the jokes were cheap but made the film more enjoyable the cgi i thought did justice to the original keeping the authentic and distinguished ghostbusters look definitely not a first date movie as the all female main cast and the fact that itin its own way makes fun of men would not be a great talking point overall its a good movie with some great  cameos from the original
Jul 22 2016,positive,this is actually a nice remake that stands on its own but contains lots of references to the original    its cerebrial humor that youll be thinking about days later vs other movies that are funny but quickly forgotton  the main cast are also fun characters that would work great in an animated series
Jul 22 2016,negative,horrible pacing lackluster performances unnecessarily divisive a complete disappointment
Jul 22 2016,negative,does the new ghostbusters really suck that bad  is the atomic weight of cobalt 589  if this ghostbusters movie sucked as big as a twinkie thats one big twinkie
Jul 22 2016,negative,unfunny and forgettable  the ghostbusters franchise deserves better
Jul 22 2016,negative,i was paid to see this i am not impressed at all the jokes where not funny and i cannot belive what they try to call ghosts look like saturday morning cartoons
Jul 22 2016,positive,absolutely hilarious movie great casting and acting brilliant writing i think a lot of people will have preconceptions about it which is a shame because it was a very fun movie to watch
Jul 22 2016,positive,with its energetic cast and its playful direction by feig its impossible not to enjoy ghostbusters even if its not in line with its original material nor a sensical beautifully animated piece of scifi its heavy on the comedy and while some of those jokes dont land say 20 theres enough to work with here that does not warrant the vile negative criticism this film faces
Jul 22 2016,positive,wouldve been great without some of the forced jokes chris hemsworth made the movie
Jul 22 2016,positive,absolutely loved this movie you cant compare this to its 80s parent since itss its own movie
Jul 21 2016,positive,my husband and i enjoyed this i am looking forward to seeing this with our kids
Jul 21 2016,positive,love the  hope its a part 2 they all played there part shots out to the og original ghostbusters was n the movie plan on seeing it again in imax
Jul 21 2016,positive,i was relieved that first trailer looked like crap once the characters got together i was in chemistry great gadgets great dialogue funny plot a little choppy bummer ghosts looked a little too disney at times    im hoping the sequel will be even better once the cameos and set pieces are out of the way
Jul 21 2016,negative,boring like an snl skit that goes on too long  kate mckinnon is dope though
Jul 21 2016,positive,excellent  im going at least five times to see it again and again
Jul 21 2016,positive,so fun loved it best movie of the year the cast was great consistently funny and on point cant wait to see the sequel
Jul 21 2016,negative,this is a shit movie dont spend your money on this black hole of a flick
Jul 21 2016,negative,certified fresh no way
Jul 21 2016,negative,all in all not very good  a lot of the movie didnt make much sense i didnt laugh at all really its worth watching on netflix or redbox maybe if youre bored
Jul 21 2016,positive,this movie was very funny i thought this was as good as the original one i hope they make another one
Jul 21 2016,negative,this movie has its moments but falls flat as a result of poor logical consistency or engaging characters apart from kristin wiig none of the other main cast were compelling or engaging in any way with them choosing to play more as a caricature than a character    this deviates heavily from the original ghostbusters where the humor was more often of the deadpan variety whereas this movie felt more like an snl sketch with each character struggling badly not to laugh at their own poorly thought out jokes
Jul 21 2016,positive,this movie is just fine it has some good scenes and jokes chris hemsworth is funny what else is there to say also sony is defiantly paying off critics to like the film
Jul 21 2016,positive,i thought i was going to hate this movie surprisingly it wasnt half bad its certainly not as good as the originals but did anybody really expect it to be still this movie on its own serves for some decent entertainment
Jul 21 2016,positive,my opinion of this movie is pretty much in line with what a lot of critics are saying the character interactions are great the story is formulaic and forgettable leslie jones needs to be give a better part because her comedic gifts are squandered and her character doesnt have much to do kate mckinnon gives a standout performance  compared to other feig movies i liked this about as much as bridesmaids not quite as much as spy  id recommend seeing it with the expectation that youll be getting a good but not great comedy whose biggest strength is in its characters
Jul 21 2016,negative,the jokes were bad and they kept dragging on those bad jokes instead of just letting it go terrible acting way too cartoonish
Jul 21 2016,positive,loved it absolutely phenomenal
Jul 21 2016,positive,this movie was great  it was funny the cameos were well timed and hilarious  i think most of the comedy is kid ok but a few parts werent  some of it is a bit scarier for the younger set  over all i feel the movie was super entertaining well paced and had an awesome during credits and post credit set of scenes  i know that the anti female crowd is going strong against this movie but i thoroughly enjoyed it and kate mckinnon and leslie jones were just great in it
Jul 21 2016,positive,avoid it was fun but wait for the dvd
Jul 21 2016,negative,im late to the party but we all know this film sucks big dick the story sucks the cgi sucks but most of all the jokes suck who ever wrote this film should be fired along with paul feig katie dippoid amy pascal and anyone else who helped make this shitty remake that no one asked for    stick a fork in this its done
Jul 21 2016,positive,the film most controversial of the year scares entertains  satisfies    i want to release my review  principially positive  of profane languages and emotions towards the haters the only thing i will express would be swallow your own shit fucking haters now lets start    ghosts from our past is titled the book written by dr erin gilbert and dr abby yates in which establish how to identify and counteract a paranormal entity the book is a failure and as a cliché of  female buddy films  take directions different erin gilbert kristen wiig works as a professor at columbia university while abby continues   to studying the paranormal with a peculiar engineer dr jillian holtzmann kate mckinnon however ghosts from past will return to torment to erin she find out that abby returned to publish the book in digital platforms such as amazon without her consent decides to reunite with her partner for remove from the network the stormy book that will possibly ruin her life abby accepts with only one condition she guiding them to a museum in new york where powerful supernatural forces have evidenced this the first venue for a series of conspiracies to will free all the vengeful spirits of the city a very suggestive and promising initial plot that will impressed even the most skeptical with the best of a summer film    we all remember with affection and nostalgia to supernatural comedy film released in 1984 directed and produced by ivan reitman which left an indelible hallmark on the global pop culture and became a obliged reference for corporate films of today although we are in the period of resume ideas  mad max fury road  benhur  and apparently the productions of hollywood is being obsolete however this not means that all reboots has been a fiasco 1984  are gone and new generations deserve to know the foundations for the comedy films therefore paul feigs ghostbusters is a complete delight the reboot offers some tributes to the original  it is obvious they were inspired by it  but the atmosphere is different team is different the spirit is different so it has to be assessed as a individual product it not as the cheap copy that they have sold us detractors    the relationship between the new team is palpitating glorious and powerful showing its hefty power in each frame which makes innovative and entertaining to progress of the film is not its screenplay itself it is the analogy of its characters the colossal and different attitudes of its protagonists each one struggling to dominate but it is inviable to declare the winner is like a frenzied crescendo we have already seen the knowledge that mccarthy possesses for the comedy genre with the comical film of last year spy bridesmaids of 2011 directed by feig or even this year with the boss a woman with a so unique and bold humor that has become the humorous lady of the decade in the film world i am a great admirer and outside the world praises her with so much potential its no wonder her performance in her last movie boundless guffaws kristen wiig goes by the same road and despite she is not stand out like melissa the duo plays of wonder and remain in place of beginning to end in the film with their supernatural form of make laugh and also cry    rowan north neil casey plays a villain singularly strange a guy inspired in the book of abby and erin that want to avenge of the world that called him weird he is part of the heterogeneous mix developed around the film his quality is proportional to the progress of the film  his final manifestations are fantastic they will be a pleasant surprise for fans north is also responsible for guiding patty tolan leslie jones to the team an african american woman who works in the subway of new york requests the help of the ghostbusters for later inundates of laughters and exceptional moments to the audience holtzmann kate mckinnon is the queen she portrays a crazy engineer with a couple of screws loose but with strengths and well represented in the corresponding scenes perfect and ideal complement to the team it is not the silly addition says absurd and irritating comments that role fell into the hands of another holtzman is the brain of the operation constantly makes improvements of her weapons her technology and her defenses a character special hemsworth has tried to venture into the comedy world he had a small cameo the last year with vacation but this time he dared to be the sexy secretary of the ghostbusters kevin a young man with glasses without lens and with childish pants invades in the life of the quartet to fill of comments to some extent funny but feig knows how control it and do not exceed this resource until the end characters creatures ghosts and songs from the original are perfectly implemented by feig and his team something that fans will love of the original i did it    special effects are unreal obviously but just enough to implant his own hallmark and his signature on each frame neon colors rays and smoke the new team annihilates to ghosts and adversities present in the story multiple cameos were used but the less surprising and satisfactory was the of bill murray who appeared in form of bitter person and without nothing of his humor of the initial this was another character but he could rethink his role    paul and his team have done an extravagant work a puzzle  meticulously armed which only falters in small and invisible aspects nothing is superfluous nor badly worn it is simply ghostbusters i confess when i heard the emblem song the franchise felt nostalgia but after seeing the final result i say with confidence it was worth 1984 has its own but 2016 screams perfection beyond of the purpose of the film entertainment the extension of the film and especially the end after the credits is a clear analogy to the revocation of the female voice in a misogynist and discriminatory world  the girls say we have achieved it and successfully they have achieved it with honors
Jul 21 2016,positive,hilarious  a roller coaster ride  i saw it with my kids and we had a great time  there are some scary bits but even my 5 year old was ok a super summer movie
Jul 21 2016,positive,i loved this movie and i think it was very interesting how they added there comedy in it was also amazing how they added things from the originals this movie is awesome please watch it
Jul 21 2016,negative,it was pretty mediocre after all was said and done the comedy was hit or miss the story was pretty spotty and the villain was so lame it wasnt as terrible as the trailers would have you believe but it was pretty bland overall     there were standouts kate mckinnon was great as holtzmann  leslie jones as patty  and chris hemsworth had some funny moments  the effects in imax were nicely done even if the ghosts were a bit scoobydoo     its not as great as the classic its not as horrible aso we thought it might be its nothing that will inspire multiple viewings and become a cultural phenomenon but it still has funny moments and no doubt will be enjoyed by some people out there it just wasnt for me
Jul 21 2016,positive,not horrible but certainly not a great movie  most of the jokes misfire  two of the four actresses earned their paychecks
Jul 21 2016,positive,i loved it  they ladies were hilarious  dont compare it too much to the original and enjoy it  i think they could do a lot with a sequel 
Jul 21 2016,negative,ruining my childhood
Jul 21 2016,positive,not as good as the original  but loved the easter eggs and cameos  fun watch
Jul 21 2016,positive,super funny these ladies did a great job loved all the cameos
Jul 21 2016,negative,the intro to this movie is really good so are other parts of this film     then comes the rest of the movie bad jokes that dont land call backs to the original film is nice to some but to others it shows the writers werent confident with this movie standing on its own feet    in films you want to feel like youre either rooting  for the good guy or booing the big bad in this film you find yourself not doing either there was never a threat of danger and a lot of what happens doesnt remotely seem realistic     i usually give a rating out of 10 stars i give this movie a 25 i would tell you to wait for a bootleg or redbox
Jul 21 2016,positive,for all its pastiche sly winking and hat tipping for all its shoehorned cameos and familiar visuals particularly in the chaotic third act which owes a hefty debt to the originals stay puft marshmallow man paul feigs all female reimagining of ghostbusters manages to stand on its own two feet its balance isnt always secure its comedic charm has a tendency to fall into lulls as the film wears on but what paul feig and his cast offer up is a genuinely big hearted adventure with genuinely big hearted characters telling a story that never feels as though its merely going through the easy payday mechanics of nostalgia   the plot structure and character outlines of 2016s ghostbusters stay true to the stencils created by dan aykroyd and harold ramis 32 years earlier kristen wiig plays erin gilbert a lecturer whos kicked her previous research into the paranormal to the curb in favour of a more legitimated career in science however when shes begrudgingly caught up in a spontaneous ghost hunt with her former colleague abby yates melissa mccarthy a feistier dan aykroyd type with her unwavering passion for all things supernatural and her tech savvy sidekick jillian kate mckinnon the egon equivalent but makes the character her own with a manic eccentricity any hopes in a more traditional career are zapped and she quickly finds herself in the ghost game once again  ousted as the whackeos who believe in the abnormal the trio set up their own ghost hunting business and thanks to the vengeful  but underwhelming occultist rowan neil casey out to teach the bully laden world a lesson by summoning ghosts across new york they quickly find themselves on the spooky frontlines between the heroes and the villains there is the faint undercurrent of overcoming social exile but the film never hits this theme as sharply as itd like      sassy ghost spotter patty leslie jones playing a character written to sterotype completes the quartet as they set out to save new york from an increasingly malevolent series of ghouls   2016s ghostbusters always seemed to be fighting an uphill battle after its much maligned trailer its a surprise when you consider the back catalogue of writerdirector paul feig and his partnership with melissa mccarthy spy and bridesmaids for a sheer hitmiss comedy ratio are as strong as anything to come out in the last 5 years its no shock then that 2016s revamping avoids falling flat on its face it is a clear step in quality below both the original and feigs most recent action packed mccarthian efforts however what todays ghostbusters lacks is the consistency with its comedy   theres an affable spirit to the film which keeps its comedic charm chugging along a brand of comedy which is bolstered by the confidence of the overthetop mackinnon and the inherent charm of wiig chris hemsworth is also a handy gotoman for gags playing the quartets dumb as a post ditsy secretary but feigs ghostbusters with its reliance on zaniness cant help but feel stagnant with its episodic second act   the brilliance of the originals comedy is how deadpan and matteroffact it is in dealing with its supernatural villains the original particularly through bill murray is so understated that it doesnt feel as though its trying to be funny at all it just is by nature feigs comedy styling is much more overt it hits you over the head with its zingers which when they dont pay off can leave a sour taste in your mouth   what feig also struggles to do is negotiate both spectacle and laughs ghostbusters obligatory explosion bound finale feels rather toothless for all its enormity it lacks imagination and colour and puts its strongest attribute its performers on the back burners until the dust settles feig is never able to entwine action and comedy a surprise given that was one of the key strengths of 2015s spy and also a disappointment given how intheirelement the cast prove themselves to be when given a chance    the reality is 1984s ghostbusters was always destined as an actioncomedy blockbuster to be revisited and 2016s visitation is solid it hits its mark often enough that when it drags were content with its affability alone it leaves much to be desired 1984s benchmark was always going to see to that but if you were worried the all female incarnation of the team would be a black mark on the franchise you can rest easy        if for any reason you enjoyed reading this please head to 
Jul 21 2016,negative,i dont know there is something about this movie that didnt capture like how it was with the original movies every time i watch the first classic ghostbusters its always fun amusing and adventurous to watch maybe its because the characters are so likable that every scene theyre in especially together is so fun to watch but for this 2016 version of ghostbusters it wasnt like that at all it was fun it was not really amusing and it is somehow adventurous i guess this movie was made for the current generation and perhaps the previous as well and it may very well be for the future but they cant take away what i love the most is the four original members of the ghostbusters that made every situation interesting to watch sure we have this new group but i cant help to think that it was because of political correctness the jokes are bland and the comedian side of it was so lacking i only laughed out loud three times however lets not blame the actors for being in this movie because i think theyve done a great job kristen wiig i had no doubts that she will do well in this movie and i was right her performance was so well played her portrayal was splendid kate mckinnon shows performance as the geekiest science chick youll ever known and that she seems to be cool to hang out with as for the other two they werent so appealing to me dont get me wrong they also did a great job but i guess im not real fan for the both of them melissa mccarthy seemed to act like the same as she was when i watched her performance in identity thief but i think she did better in identity thief than in this movie honestly i dont find her funny at all but i guess other people do and comedy is not actually created for all people equally anyways whatever floats your boat i guess leslie jones is kinda funny but hey im not saying she didnt do well but she actually did her performance is spot on but i think her portrayal of the character is too stereotypical or maybe im just getting off the wrong foot here whatever the case may be i just didnt like her character i just thought her character is far better off in another direction    lets talk a little bit about the cameos you can spot everyone there who was known to be in the first original movie except for one actor and rip it would have been so awesome to see him in the movie with his intellectual abilities as egon but heres the thing no one was doing a cameo of their respectable characters i mean no one they were someone else sure you can spot them and say hey theyre in the movie but theyre not playing as their characters bill murray was not peter venkman dan aykroyd wasnt ray annie potts wasnt janine not even ernie hudson wasnt winston so whats up with that well it is a complete reboot and i guess its not within the same universe as the original films which is fine i guess we can still treat the originals as the originals after all and treat this new one as an actual reboot the fact of the matter is that this new ghostbusters is not my cup of tea or ectoplasm if you will i didnt really enjoy much of the movie but the set up in the beginning was pretty good and the pace of it was good characters are at least likable but i did like erin and holtzmann oh and lets not forget chris hemsworths character the nerdy yet notsonerdy goofy gulliblelike character named kevin i thought he was pretty funny in this movie his awkwardness yet awful kindness towards others is what kept me watching the movie to say the least it added the flavor into the story overall because you know thor is a cool guy this movie is much of a rental than it is to own but if you love paranormal and comedy altogether than i guess this is for you but if you havent watched the original movies i strongly recommend you watch them  theyre better
Jul 21 2016,positive,loved it very funny from all the comedians mckinnon stole the show
Jul 21 2016,positive,movie is hilarious it is comedy recommend
Jul 21 2016,positive,it was alright there were some funny scenes and references to the franchise however i dont know if im sold on this crew for all the marketing hype this shouldve been better still not bad if you are not expecting too much
Jul 21 2016,negative,the commercials were enough for me
Jul 21 2016,negative,worst movie of the year
Jul 21 2016,positive,a very middle of the road comedy that does not live up to the hype or the controversy surrounding it it would almost be not worth mentioning if it wasnt was for the past franchise that its banking on while i wouldnt call it terrible it is simply forgettable
Jul 21 2016,negative,i was excited to see this movie yet couldnt get past 21 minutes of it i walked out it is not funny it is dumb has awkward humor attempts just not for me good luck you have been warned instead i recommend life of pets
Jul 21 2016,negative,average at best sony mishandled a very talented cast with lazy unfunny script its meh no bribed professional reviewers will make this successful  based on opening weekend this movie will do little else  pay attention sony this is how you ruin a franchise
Jul 21 2016,positive,better than what most people are saying
Jul 21 2016,negative,the screenplay was very poor
Jul 21 2016,positive,very funny great cast minus the sniveling pipsqueak bad guy laughed throughout the entire film completely reverential of the source material great chemistry between the characters kate mckinnons performance really stood out would highly recommend to fans of the original or viewers completely new to the property
Jul 21 2016,negative,terrible worst movie of the year not funny at all i cant believe that folks were bullied into giving it a good review dont believe the hype
Jul 21 2016,negative,so after sober reflection i have determined that the new ghostbusters was a total piece of shit heres why    1 the plot was flimsy at best without an acceptable build to the climaxif there was actually a climax that i somehow missed    2 the humor was the worst kind of pandering popculture driven tripe that dominates modern cinema and will be totally unrelateable in 5 years thereby eliminating any possibility of a timeless quality that will create appeal for later viewing    3 the characters were unrelateable irritating without screen chemistry or backstory the best part of any characterization was the chameo appearances of original cast memberswhich was obvious and forced in a painfully obvious way    4 there was a decidedly reverse sexist approach to any male in the cast where every man was portrayed as dumb evil inept or eye candy which would have been totally unacceptable if the tables were turned    5the attempt to revisit the original concept utterly cheapened the franchise with its failure to pay even reasonable homage to such a popular and iconic film or its sequel    looking at the box office totals i dont think theyll make another one unless they have producers who want to loose a bunch more moneybut this is modern cinema at its finest so i wouldnt be surprised i will have to remain hopeful that they leave this home executed abortion burned behind the tool shed and never decide to dig it up again
Jul 21 2016,positive,loved it cant wait for the next one
Jul 21 2016,negative,a feminist fail of a great brand 
Jul 21 2016,negative,really not very good at all even though i actually like most of these cast i thought that the whole movie was just trying too hard not funny though it thinks it is   didnt connect the way they were trying to make just a big fail and only worth it for the small cameos by the surviving members of the original cast
Jul 21 2016,positive,fantastic summer movie these women are hilarious and chris hemsworth plays a handsome yet dumb man very well i loved it and definitely wish grown ass middleaged men would quit boohooing and give credit where its due
Jul 21 2016,positive,i enjoyed the original ghostbusters back in the 80s  nothing compares to the comedic chemistry between acroyd  murray but the latest version was still very entertaining  funny it is nice to see funny women in leading roles  this redo oh gb did not fail to deliver in both laughs  special effects i will probably go see it again with other family members
Jul 21 2016,positive,fun movie and great cameos
Jul 21 2016,negative,i really wanted to like this movie but it was actually really bad sorry i tried
Jul 21 2016,positive,by no means the original but still pretty darn enjoyable     definitely recommend it
Jul 21 2016,neutral,the ladies were funny the movie was meh
Jul 21 2016,positive,dont be put off by the internet trashtalk about this movie  its very entertaining with a funny script much spookier ghosts and loads of actor cameos best cameo for me was at the heavymetal concert after a very demoniclooking creature had been captured  ozzy osbourne sharon i think im having a flashback
Jul 21 2016,positive,its pure magic that everyone should absolutely see its so great and the cast is great i wish i could hug every single humanbeing that helped make this movie to thank them for this god given gift i feel blessed to be in the generation that gets to tell people they were a kid when this was in theaters 17 year old girl who hates everything but this movie and mac and cheese while at the theater before seeing it for a second time
Jul 21 2016,positive,im not blindly biased about the original ghostbusters as many other lifelong fans tend to be and im also not afraid to admit that i like ghostbusters ii better than the first     with that said this new ghostbusters may not have the originality and importance of the original but it definitely has the entertainment value    the new quartet of ghostfighters is made up of kristen wiig melissa mccarthy kate mckinnon and leslie jones as a reboot to an allnew series the story shows how they come together and rise to fame amidst backlash from the government and other naysayers    the loomingand probably inadvertentcold war undertones of the original get substituted for nothing in this one and honestly its better that way we have enough social commentary in our superhero movies these days that we dont need it all the time sometimes its good to have a movie that can just be fun    and thats what this film is in many ways this one is funnier whereas the the original found comedy from pretty much just bill murray and rick moranis this one tries squeezing it out of its entire cast sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt     it mostly doesnt work in the case of mckinnon and jones while jones comedy style doesnt fit well in most places mckinnons just doesnt fit well in this scenario wiig will say or do something funny and then mckinnon pipes in and it awkwardly falls flat its jarring its not just that the audience doesnt expect itthe audience doesnt want it i think kate mckinnon is funny and i love the brand of humor she brings to this movie but it just doesnt work here     there are few that may appreciate the cringe humor of mckinnon but to most others they just wont get it which isnt really what you want in a very mainstream reboot of one of the most popular comedies of all time     chris hemsworth is the brightest ray of sunshine in this film as he plays the earnestly stupid receptionist who goes as far as proposing the 7eleven graphic as the logo for the ghostbusters team    the script has some pacing issues but a lot of the jokes are wellwritten and thoughtout imagine if the ones that fell flat didnt director paul feig does a good job not just handing mccarthy the reins and letting her run off with it recklessly fortunately shes contained enough that it doesnt just feel like her movie where shes stepping on everybodys toes in fact no one really does    there are enough solid references to the original film to keep old fans into it theres that connection it never feels like a distant cousin of ghostbusters but like it could possibly still be in that same universe    its obviously not as much of a zeitgeist of an era as the original ghostbusters was no one ever expected it to be in fact no one really expected anything with the exception of those fanboys who just hated its existence and that plays in its favor as we can just sit back and be entertained for all that its worth    twizard rating 88
Jul 21 2016,negative,this ghostbusters had its moments the best of which were the cameos of the original ghostbusters outside of that it was allot of jokes that fell flat
Jul 21 2016,positive,this movie was amazing  cannot wait to see it again tomorrow
Jul 21 2016,positive,i went into this movie out of boredom and curiosity and wanted to hate it but by the end i honestly didnt mind it the plot is very typical and the characters leave much to be desired chris hemsworth steals the show by acting like the moronic macho man hes so much better as this than thor but i digress the ending as gets a bit convoluted and to the point where they are trying to call back to the old movies as well as outdo them it just gets in the way more than anything speaking of callbacks our 3 original ghostbusters that are alive still make appearances in the film with bill murrays being the most prominent but im sure you could have figured that out just based on the trajectory of all their careers finally you can clearly see they are setting up a series of films here and i have no problem with that i just would like a better story than rehashing the old ideas with a new twist and i would like them to not try as hard for gag laughs
Jul 21 2016,positive,good ensemble work breakout star time for kate mckinnon
Jul 21 2016,positive,thoroughly enjoyed it
Jul 21 2016,positive,this is really a superb movie even though i havent seen it but its completely different than the original movie of the same name but the new is just the same
Jul 21 2016,positive,i will say up front i enjoyed this movie all the women had great scenes with jokes and humor that felt natural and almost always landed the story did have some holes most notably a villain worth fearing  the government in the form of andy garcia and his mayoral minions was not a particularly effective foil either the third act did seam a bit rushed but plausible within the rules established by the movie largest disappointment none of the cameos where great the movie overall was well acted and written many times i laughed out loud so dont take these statements as negatives to not see this film as remakes go this was a strong offering   go see it get some pop corn and enjoy dont forget to stay after the credits for the teaser   you will be pleasantly surprised by this one  35 out 5
Jul 21 2016,positive,first the original was not a classic it had a hit song and made a lot of money happy gilmore made a lot of money too its no classic either i have no idea why people felt the original was such a great movie when i saw it in the 80s it was good when i watched it recently on tv it was torturously slow with insanely bad acting in no way did its mediocrity stand the test of time   this ghostbusters is equally as good with special effects that are 30 years improved it will not be up for an academy award but it only sucked as much as the original also many comments mention its man hating as well i say grow the f up
Jul 21 2016,negative,awful sony win again to make a quick million or 2 from us no thought to the movie at all
Jul 21 2016,negative,an unnecessary reboot i was hoping against hope it would be better and prove the original trailer wrong but alas a very weak villian especially his motives weak script only one of the main character is truly developed for why they are doing what they are doing over reliance on cgi there are some decent lines thrown out but they try to squeeze in so many at a time that they lose their punch kate mckinnon is an interesting character but shes on overdrive the whole movie that it teeters the line of being a positive and a negative mccarthy and wiig appear stiffened like they didnt want to come off as a copy of one of the original characters that they dont make the characters their own i think they could do something with this property but they need a better script writer for the 2nd installment if there happens to be one
Jul 21 2016,negative,great if you are into manbashing but otherwise not even remotely a comedy nor does it do justice to the ghostbusters franchise we can only hope they dont make enough to forge ahead with another please do not empower sony to think this is the type of movies we want
Jul 21 2016,positive,slow predictable kinda boring
Jul 21 2016,positive,this is the first time i have ever bothered to elaborate on a rating but i felt it was warranted in this case when i was trying to decide whether or not i wanted to see this i scrolled through the user reviews and couldnt find a single person who had actually seen it the socalled reviews  which seemed to be all a 12 star or a single star  were actually complaints from who objected to the movie being remade  a week after its release i scrolled through the reviews again and found somebody who had actually seen the movie and gave it four stars i also give it four stars it was a lot of fun not as good as the original but the original had the surprise element  as bill murrays character said you dont expect that sort of behavior from a major appliance  also the additional comedic bits as the credits rolled were a hoot
Jul 21 2016,positive,hilarious and a fantastic cast there are pacing issues and the story slogs some but it is a fun ride for the close to 2 hours paul feig did not ruin ghostbusters he made a fun spiritual successor that does well by the franchise name
Jul 21 2016,positive,loved the characters modern presentation of a classic movie i know people have hesitations about remakes or reboots whatever you like to call it give it a chance i did and i dont regret watching
Jul 21 2016,negative,i will never see this im just here to help give it as low a rating as possible if flixster allowed a rating of zero id give that
Jul 21 2016,negative,this movie is not very funny at all also a lot of malebashing  fans wont like it one bit
Jul 21 2016,positive,i actually thoroughly enjoyed this though the pacing at some points is slow and the editing is strange noticeably to me but other than that is was a very enjoyable film the first act was patchy and sort of slow but then when it got to the second and third act i was actually pretty engulfed in it so because of the first act people might be a little wary but things seem to build up and get better the only thing i didnt like was the villain because he was a douche and i guess thats what its supposed to be but something about his doucheyness irked me and the editing which i probably only noticed but by the end i found myself hoping for a sequel and usually i dont care for sequels but by the end i just wanted to watch these characters interact more so that has to mean something for the most part it was well executed
Jul 21 2016,negative,this movie was shit not funny at all story was incredibly weak sauce cast was fine but even the best actors cant turn shit into rainbows cameos were telegraphed and forced paul feig doesnt get ghostbusters or why people love it and it would do colombia pictures to fire him and start over
Jul 21 2016,negative,terrible just awful
Jul 21 2016,positive,i absolutely loved it the humor was fantastic without taking away from the action the animation was great sopilers except for the very end when erin goes after abby in the portal i thought that animation could have been better and the cast was extremely talented although i thought erin was a bit too adam sandler for me my favorite would definitely have to be the portrayal of holtzman by kate mckinnon who is definitely one of my all time favorite character actors from watching her on snl i also loved patty she was the outsider like the audience not understanding most of the technical jargon but wanting to help out anyway she expressed the same confusion that the audience was facing in hilarious and witty ways that helped the audience feel less uncomfortable with not understanding
Jul 21 2016,positive,i think that its going to be  cool  for  little girl cause  she loves  comedy
Jul 21 2016,positive,it was a glorious movie it had me sitting on the edge of my seat literally i loved the cameos i was happy to see the stay puft man as well as hear the song being redone i will definitely watch it again
Jul 21 2016,positive,im gonna try to make this easy to understand to accommodate some people    1 its not really a horror movie if youre expecting to be scared screaming jumping out of your seats or have nightmares later on this movie isnt really like that but if you are jumpy to begin with it has its moments but nothing too scary if youve seen the other ghost buster movies then its kinda like that but not really i could try to explain it but i suggest to just see the movie im saying this because i saw a review that said it was a disappointing horror movie and it just annoyed me so much and now im writing this review because of it    2 take all your expectations from the old movies and put them away also put away your judgmental attitudes and negativity towards women for this movie seriously it ruins the movie you can enjoy this movie for the amazing detail it does have this is why i said put away all the expectations based from the old movie and youd appreciate the actors fitting in so well as their characters this is why youd put away your judgmental attitude    3 ladies im telling you just go see it also if you have smallyoung children its not really something theyd be into unless theyre fudging awesome kids no offense to the nice kids or anything    i was actually pleasantly surprised i didnt think i was going to like this movie at all but i really enjoyed myself and laughed so hard i was wiping tears off my face was it perfect absolutely not i wont say its a great movie its just a fun movie definitely worth seeing pacing was sometimes weird some of the scenes seem unnecessary there were things they could have done better but its all minor stuff dont let negative people take away the experience because im telling you its a gosh darn fun movie now go go see it
Jul 21 2016,negative,just plain terrible this is the plot from pixels with the jokes from movie 43 combining two terrible films does not make a good one and slapping the ghostbusters logo on the top is just down right insulting
Jul 21 2016,positive,totally surprised at how funny it was
Jul 21 2016,negative,this movie was awful save your time money and sanity and enjoy the original
Jul 21 2016,negative,super disappointed with this movie if people really want to get honest reviews then dont bother looking at the critics review most of them are too afraid to tell you that the movie was a bit boring and stupid because they are afraid it will make them look like sexists i dont care if the main leads are women or men i just want the movie to be good and have a good story thats why we pay a crapload of money to go see movies the jokes in this movie were pretty lame they try way too hard the cgi used to make the ghosts reminded me of disneys haunted mansion i really had high hopes for this movie since i grew up with the originals the stupid jokes crappy cgi the main villain and the script itself made it hard to even keep interest in this movie i pray they dont make anymore they should have enough sense to know that they are screwing up this franchise how can the ghost of a person who killed himself automatically have the power of gozar for no apparent reason i have seen some reboots that sucked badly but this just went lower on the scale for me do not waste your money on this movie better yet borrow it from someone when it comes out on bluray but trust me though if you are a fan of the originals and think this movie will be close enough to it to make sense or at least be entertaining enough to stand on its own be prepared to be majorly disappointed
Jul 21 2016,negative,complete and utter garbage
Jul 21 2016,negative,feminazi crap movie that depicts men as idiots and villans main message women are men  tramps on the original and does not respects it or build apon it humor is silly and brainless slapstick
Jul 21 2016,negative,i had such high hopes
Jul 21 2016,negative,410 the less said the better
Jul 21 2016,negative,horribly sexist garbage filmdont waste your time or money on another paul feig piece of shit movie
Jul 21 2016,positive,funny fresh great likeable characters nice nods to the past loved it
Jul 21 2016,positive,dont understand the hate for this movie we loved it great fun 
Jul 21 2016,negative,painful to watch  want to see the funniest parts watch the trailer and save your 
Jul 21 2016,positive,this movie was very entertaining and humorous
Jul 21 2016,positive,so if you go into this wanting a remake of the original you need to readjust your mindset if you think this is a remake of the original as some reviewers apparently do then you have the wrong mindset watch this with an open mind with no thoughts of the original other than appreciating the nods to it and various cameos and you should find this a very enjoyable movie i was pleasantly surprised at just how much i did like it as i went in with very low expectations    is it a classic as the original was no is it a serviceable reboot with a new cast yes am i glad i went to see it absolutely    kate mckinnon is awesome and in my opinion the undisputed star of this movie i may like it as much as i do purely because of how much i enjoyed her performance    there were weak moments and it is not going to win any awards but it is a solid summer kill some time and entertain yourself movie
Jul 21 2016,negative,i left room in 15 min this movie is worst  i like  better see pixels than this movie
Jul 21 2016,positive,get off the hate train this movie was great i laughed at the first line in the movie and it never stopped from there i loved the original just accept this is different and new everyone attached was outstanding
Jul 21 2016,positive,cannot help but love this film great cast great comedy kate mckinnon the standout star
Jul 21 2016,negative,worst movie ever waste of money   dont hold candle stick to original
Jul 21 2016,negative,fuck this pile of libtard bullshit freemilo
Jul 21 2016,negative,how how on earth did this movie some how get 73 from critics and 58 from audience how i cant believe i live in a time where this is true haha
Jul 21 2016,negative,a complete waste of time  the movie had no jokes nor even close to a funny set up  the black chick was the worst character sloppy stupid and lazy is not funny unless she was trying on a steppin fetchit routine  the directors whinging about misogyny to the original trailer was totally bogus but i think the cast and crew has inflicted torture that only the marquis de sade would relish
Jul 21 2016,positive,while i normally like to write my reviews on the day i see the film with this one  i wanted to wait a bit  i wanted to let the immediate knee jerk reactions settle before i put my thoughts down in writing  and you know what  im glad i did  because now that i have i can look at the flaws the film had that i initially overlooked in my euphoria of women busting ghosts and talk about this film objectively    and what is my objective opinion  women busting ghosts is awesome    lets get the obvious out of the way  yes the movie had some flaws so lets talk about them  this will be mildly spoilery but honestly  its a ghostbusters movie you kind of know whats going to happen  and that is sort of one of the problems  not so much that its predictable but more so the reason its predictable  what i found funny about this whole thing was that every time they tried to harken back to the original ghostbusters was when it fell flattest  it was sort of nice to see the old actors come back but every time they did it took me right out  and the climax  its not a 11 redo of the original but its close enough that it was definitely boring  at least most of it was  they did do some interesting things and again it was when they deviated from the original that it was most interesting    not all of the jokes landed for me either but thats not to say they werent funny  they werent funny to me but ive seen plenty of other people laughing about them  thats one of the good things about this movie even while it may be part of my negatives over all  they used a lot of different comedy techniques and while they dont all work for every audience member they play such a wide range that youre going to laugh just maybe not at everything  hemsworth for example  i loved 90 of what he did but there was one joke that fell completely flat for me  it was just too stupid  he was too stupid to be believable  but my mother sitting next to me laughed and laughed hard      the one unforgivable thing for me anyway was the villain  talk about forgettable  i cant even remember his name right now  every scene he was in was pointless  his motivation was half assed at best  his delivery was grating and unrealistic  and the payoff was again predictable and boring  but to the films credit hes not really the focus  they keep the focus where it needs to be on the comedy    and that brings me to the good stuff and god there is just so much  ive already talked about the comedy a little but i need to do it better justice  by the halfway mark my face quite literally hurt because i had been smiling for that long  the four main characters are hilarious each in completely different ways  chris hemsworth is fantastic stretching his comedic acting and rarely faltering  the slapstick humor didnt really do it for me but then thats not really my style of comedy      the updates were really interesting as well  we get to see these women literally fight ghosts  theres no more standing in a straight line and pointing guns  these women have weapons that let them punch them  they have proton whips  they have bombs  there is a fight scene during the climax where one of the women my favorite as it happens fights off a mob of ghosts  not only is it an amazing fight in and of itself but this is a woman in a jumpsuit  she is not thrusting her boobs or ass at us  at no point during the fight was she sexualized in any way  i really sat and tried to think of the last time id seen that in film and you know what i came up with  nothing  not one instance where a woman was in a fight and didnt either have on tight clothing making strange sex noises instead of pain noises when being hit or end up in provocative poses  and here is this gem of a movie    so what are my final thoughts  is this movie better than the original  no  but its not trying to be  its not the same kind of movie and it excels in a completely different way  if you go in expecting to compare it to the original its not going to pass because that is not what it intended to do  but if you go in expecting to see a great hilarious group of women battle some ghosts and kick some ass then youre going to have a great time    and remember    safety lights are for dudes
Jul 21 2016,positive,loved iti cracked up
Jul 21 2016,negative,the comedy with this one is 5050 and has plot holes all over the place
Jul 21 2016,positive,the movie is pretty good  i actually wanted it to be better because of all the prerelease hate it was getting just to shut certain internet mouth pieces up  to be sure the movie isnt bad  it just wasnt great      the cast was really good there were lots of jokes that worked and a nice irreverent sense of fun  as it begins to unfold it seemed like the group were really working towards something great and rare a successful comedyhorror hybrid      but about 12 way through the movie the pacing and flow goes a bit uneven  once everything is in place it kind of lurches towards a lackluster climax    it wasnt a bad movie  i really enjoyed the five main characters in their rolls of new ghostbusters  i just wish feig had done a better job smoothing out the final act
Jul 21 2016,negative,utterly awful  a poor remake of the original with bad jokes bastardized quotes from the exorcist etc   just cgi and poor at that with nothing original  a good cast giving bad performances with weak material  do not waste your money
Jul 21 2016,positive,bill murray appears in this ghostbusters movie but he does not portray peter venkman that is far less notable than the fact that kate mckinnon appears in this ghostbusters movie and does portray jillian holtzmann i could not take my eyes away from that character in any frame she appeared in the other players are fantastic as well this is a fun funny spectacle i cant imagine someone hating it without some sad ulterior motives im sure that such people exist but surely theyre a small fraction of the detractors paul feig makes terrific comedies and this is par for the course go laugh
Jul 21 2016,positive,i loved this it was a great nod to the original the cameos were great with the exception of their oneliners they were quotes from the original movie so it took you out of the current scene and forced the 80s version in your mind other then that i loved loved it
Jul 21 2016,negative,a couple laughs here and there but overall a stinker twitter hashtags and keyboard warriors cant save this movie from the gutter
Jul 21 2016,positive,i didnt think it was bad i had a few laughs here and there i thought the storyline was done fairly well and the acting was believable but the reason i dont love it is that i just personally thought it was scarier than it looked in its advertisements such as a few jumpscares as well as a couple of disturbinglooking monsters however some of the scary scenes are comical and have some humor to them but i wouldnt recommend seeing it if you scare easily
Jul 21 2016,positive,i thought it was funny  some of the over the top goofy stuff made it even funnier its a comedy not a drama or a scifi paul feig and melissa mccarthy made another great movie the other cast members were right on point for the characters they played you could tell they had a great time making this movie
Jul 21 2016,positive,really enjoyed it  lots of laughs and such great fun
Jul 21 2016,positive,i thought the movie was great even my mom who is a fan of the original really enjoyed it i dont know what everyone was expecting out of it and i just dont know why its getting so much hate its very laughable and enjoyable throughout the whole movie we had a great time watching
Jul 21 2016,positive,completely worth it an amazing show with a great cast of characters the weakest character was chris hemsworth imo his character did not mesh like the rest of the characters did  loved all the cameos but they were not needed to make the show work its not an epic endallbeall movie but it was really fun and i laughed a lot
Jul 21 2016,positive,i went in expecting this to suck and i was not completely right it did not suck but it was a cheap trick of a remake where they made it more about crude humor than the storyline which worked i laughed and will definitely buy this mckinnon really made this movie shine mccarthy was her usual funny self as well as the others go see it if you want about 2 hours of laughs
Jul 21 2016,positive,lots of people hated it but i liked it
Jul 21 2016,positive,bored so gave it a whirl  it is a pretty good reboot and the cameos from original cast works well d last big ghost is too much like mr staypuff o and lots of scenes are ripped straight from the original  all in all a good popcorn film but will be quickly forgotten p
Jul 21 2016,negative,i wish the film did as much work to focus what it wanted to say as im trying to put into this review my big takeaway is that the film is a disjointed mess its not horrible but you have to be very forgiving luckily kids under 10 are film buffs looking for some improvised comedy from four very funny ladies should not be there is no real reason this movie fails to live up to expectations you could have gone an original route about 4 dynamic women 3 of whom are scientists looking for respect that would have been a strong femaledriven movie if they focused on womens respect in science patty as the outsider on their side would have juxtaposed well with the mayor who was against them instead patty just joins because why not the film is thrown together and feels like every character is a side character it just doesnt hold up to the name if this was some kids film id probably have given it a 35 but since you went the gb route its a 15 and thats only for the cameos
Jul 21 2016,positive,the movie is great and funny
Jul 21 2016,positive,out with the old and in with the new people need to move on from the fact that this is a remake and enjoy a kate mckinnon movie stealing cast
Jul 21 2016,negative,every character was a terrible stereotype and every man was a mindless dolt the entire movie was non stop sexism  and completely missed every mark on almost every joke
Jul 21 2016,positive,excellent movie  fantastic special effects familiar storyline but superb all star cast each one carried their own  yet meshed very effectively  best movie ive seen this summer  this one took the last one to a whole other level i did imax  3d
Jul 21 2016,positive,i think most naysayers are tripping over the original movies  if you go at it as an entity unto itself youll probably be happier  fun movie great cast  i did have issues with the kevin character i think he could have been written better and funnier  loved the original love this one
Jul 21 2016,negative,boooooooooooooooooooooo and boooooooooo on these fake unrealistic reviews boooooooooooooooo
Jul 21 2016,negative,i was frustrated with this movie and found it disappointing at the cinema with a loose plot and underdeveloped character with humour that went amiss i also couldnt relate to the cameo roles as they bore no relation to the original movie characters yet in mind i so wanted a script link to the original movie dusty equipment in a shut down lab a former dusty professor ghostbuster now aged that they have to seek out for help just something with any depth to give any plausible explanation to the storyline
Jul 21 2016,positive,loved it it was funny well cast and uplifting definitely worth a go as a feelgood film manages to work as a sequel and its own film
Jul 21 2016,positive,i thought it was nice its not exactly the citizen kane of comedy and ill admit there were a few jokes i could have done without but the visuals were nice i liked the relationships between the characters and the plot was different enough from the original to make some of the twists a surprise  overall a pleasant way to spend two hours
Jul 21 2016,positive,this movie was incrediblelets face it its hard to beat the classics kinda like what happened with jurassic world compared to the original jurassic park but the movie was funny and entertaining and the cast did an incredible job catching the old ghostbusters humor
Jul 21 2016,positive,i was not expecting much from this movie due to luke warm  reception leading up to its release and was so pleasantly surprised at this different take on the 80s classic the all female lead roles were brilliantly acted and provided lots of laugh out loud moments chris hemsworth was great as dumb himbo kevin overall this movie is great fun and well worth a look
Jul 21 2016,negative,this movie was such a disappointment  remakes have a good opportunity to bring a fresh look and feel to a classic film but this one fails on all counts  the dialouge seemed forced and the characters all seemed like they were being crammed into stereotype riddled boxes  example  where winston zeddemore was portrayed as an intelligent hardworking common man his counterpart in this film portrayed many of the common stereotypes about black women  i expected much more from this movie
Jul 21 2016,negative,omg what happened this is a terrible movie that thinks that just because it has the ghostbusters name that it deserves your money it doesnt trust me i hate when hollywood ruins classics like the original ghostbusters dont see this movie the acting sucks the cgi sucks and the only reason im giving this movie a half star is bc of the cameos in it
Jul 21 2016,negative,ruined my childhood 
Jul 21 2016,negative,this was a horrible attempt at a reboot the jokes were uneducated childish and all around not worth it the theme of feminism was displayed as a hatred of men not an equality at all the film did nothing to honor the original or its not so great sequel nicknamed the power of patty by my family we all decided it was not worth our time to finish this under developed horrendous attempt at a supernatural comedy plus the marketing was entirely horrible
Jul 21 2016,positive,ghostbusters is an awesome and hilarious film all you people who hates it can go to hell
Jul 21 2016,positive,i thought it was cute  had its own story line but still true to original
Jul 21 2016,positive,overall i really loved this movie despite some slow periods during the beginning and middle i found the cast to be hilarious i went in thinking melissa mccarthy and kristin wiig were going to be my favourites but kate mckinnon and leslie jones kinda stole the movie for me      im rating this a little higher than i normally would to offset some of the hate this movie is receiving for no good reason some of these fanboys need to put on their big girl panties  the original movie was good but if this one ruins their childhoods then their childhoods must seriously have sucked otherwise
Jul 21 2016,positive,wretched manbabies need to quit whining
Jul 21 2016,negative,when did tracy morgan become a woman this movie made me afraid of movies what a turd you remakers are ruining our childhoods
Jul 21 2016,positive,i loved this movie was it original no was it fun with a twist of scare yes i shall be seeing this multiple times
Jul 21 2016,positive,the funniest movie i have seen in a long time
Jul 21 2016,positive,it was better than i thought it would be
Jul 21 2016,positive,it was smart and funny and not at all a rip off of the original loved it
Jul 21 2016,positive,you need to get off your high horse and watch this movie its hilarious intriguing and above all it keeps you hooked throughout the movie the women in the movie are just treated as people as they should be and are not oversexualized or any typical stereotypes of women in film i loved it i recommend it to anyone and im so inspired by the women in the movie bravo
Jul 21 2016,positive,enjoyed it from start to finish the movie was just fun and kate mckinnon stole totally stole the show
Jul 21 2016,positive,as i write this ghostbusters  answer the call has a 58 liked it rating despite a concerted effort to make the film fail  lots of boys who havent seen the film are giving it a one  to get that 58 rating people who actually saw the film are giving it fours and fives  go see it  its hilarious from the beginning to the absolute end of the credits
Jul 21 2016,positive,it was ok with such a great cast of comediennes wiig mccarthy et al i was very disappointed that the script didnt allow them to be funnier as for kate mckinnon  never saw her before and quite frankly dont care to see her again her character was beyond bizarre and a distraction
Jul 21 2016,positive,this movie was very funny exiting and actionpacked actors and actresses well  chosen
Jul 21 2016,positive,i loved the original ghostbusters and i went to see this with really low expectations honestly i dont buy into the whole fanboy bs i loved the first two transformers movies i loved mortal kombat and the dark tmnt that came out a few years ago not the one made by bay    on the other hand i totally disliked the new tmnt transformers 3 onwards and the last airbender    point if a movie is good by itself i enjoy it the new ghostbusters was very loveable the characters were hilarious def worth watching
Jul 21 2016,positive,if your childhood was ruined by this movie i have a few questions about the sanctity of your childhood to start with this movie was hilarious
Jul 21 2016,positive,i went into this movie not expecting much im a huge fan of the original and remakes dont have a good reputation this movie made me laugh made me jump and i left the theater with a warm fuzzy feeling i recommend seeing it
Jul 21 2016,positive,i really hate all the naysayers this movie was absolutely hilarious and the only reason people hate it is because they hate every remake there are people out there that claim to be movie buffs and love movies but nothing satisfies them people have got to stop having all these outrageous expectations for movies ghostbusters was a hilarious movie nuff said there didnt need to be a stellar plot or storyline all this comedy had to do was make you laugh and i think it succeeded 100 times over i absolutely loved leslie jones in this movie
Jul 21 2016,negative,not funny no storyline and cheesy cgi that is not classically cheesy like there original
Jul 21 2016,positive,it was a fun flick with parts that made me laugh out loud it certainly wont be a classic like the original but i would definitely see it again
Jul 21 2016,negative,3d effects were cool love the ladies in a lot of their work but it didnt work for me in this one a few good laughs early but seemed forced after the halfway point
Jul 21 2016,positive,actually 312 stars  better than most reviews would have you believe  the ladies are funny and work well together  lots of funny bits good sight gags and easter eggs  at times however it seems like a good sat night live skit
Jul 21 2016,negative,boring uninspired cash grab with a below average script one dimensional characters and jokes that have been dumbed down to the lowest ive seen in years
Jul 21 2016,negative,my niece enjoyed it but for me it was grueling to sit through the only good thing was the special effects  acting story and humor were just horribly done
Jul 21 2016,positive,fuck the antifeminists
Jul 21 2016,positive,having loved the original this brings back good memories kate mckinnon is sooo funny and cameo appearances by original cast are a treat
Jul 21 2016,neutral,pros chris hemsworth and kate mckinnon kids seem to like it enough  cons not particularly funny for a comedy not particularly scary for a horror movie kinda incoherent plot  overall although it certainly has its moments everything about it seems sanitized and forced given the talent in this movie and setting aside nostalgia for the original i was hoping for something like bridesmaids but with ghosts it spends way too much time trying to justify itself and lacks any real comedy teeth i think it would have been better if had shot for a hard pg13 to soft r which would have put it closer to the original in terms of content kinda disappointed  c
Jul 21 2016,positive,entertaining movie with some very funny moments i appreciate the various nods to the original
Jul 21 2016,negative,the movie was overshadowed by a constant stream of poor humour michael hat being a low point
Jul 21 2016,positive,i feel that the story by all accounts was from the first and second movies respectively i see ideas from both but mainly from the first the jokes to me sometimes fell flat however the actors are solid and do an amazing job however as we go on we start to see the effects falling off bit by bit i wish they would have went a different way with this another aspect of this film is it takes jabs at its audience so just not the best fit
Jul 21 2016,negative,absolutely disappointing the script and performance is a huge mess its not funny its a small in the face to all ghostbusters fans do yourself a favour dont watch this garbage look for the dvdblu raydigital version of the original ghostbusters and have fun because this 2016 version is horrible
Jul 21 2016,positive,actually surprised about how much hate this film received the movie had a good cast and good comedy and i dont think it deserves the amount of hate it had although its not as good as the original ghostbusters film its still worth the money  for some people maybe but at least it was better than ghostbusters 2
Jul 21 2016,negative,talented cast that is wasted by a terrible script filled with lazy unfunny jokes
Jul 21 2016,positive,fantastic movie four kick ass ladies deliver hilarious performances the cameos from the original cast is such a plus and come in when you least expect them theres a brief scene if you blink you will miss with a head statue of harold ramis chris hewsworth and  kate mckinnon are scene stealers loved this movie cant wait for sequels
Jul 21 2016,positive,good plot hope there is a sequel
Jul 21 2016,negative,this movie was a hit  mess for me and its really that good at all 12
Jul 21 2016,positive,really enjoyed this movie so great to have chick humour instead of guy humour for once much better than the trailer made it look
Jul 21 2016,positive,well balance and it gives the excitement
Jul 21 2016,positive,saw it last night loved it i find it very refreshing to actually see a super sexy character i liked and was not not for men holtz super funny laughed out loud plenty of times as a team theyre also very supportive with each other straight up  no man pain loved it so much wait for the credits you can also tell the people who made the movie even through to editing loved every second of it to everyone who didnt like it maybe it wasnt made for you
Jul 21 2016,positive,liked it lots hope they make another one with this cast
Jul 21 2016,positive,having literally grown up on a steady diet of peter venkman dishing out one liners and insults the real ghostbusters series with slimer being part of the gang this adaption worked marvels    the first time i watched it i felt a little underwhelmed  the changes they had made to my beloved characters their headquarters the cameos from classic cast who where different characters than theold busters but upon seeing it the second time and hopefully many more watches  it has earnt its place in my heart    the packs may be different but the proton stream still looks the same people
Jul 21 2016,negative,i went into this movie having not seen the original ghostbusters film and therefore had absolutely nothing to compare it to the response the first ghostbusters trailer received made many people including myself predisposed to hating this movie although i had low expectations at first the critic reviews gave me hope to what this movie could be with such a talented cast and an almost flawless director i expected so much more out of this movie there were very few times where i actually laughed but way too many times where i cringed at the horrible writing at times the failed attempts at comedy made it felt like a spoof movie especially during some of the cameos ehm ozzie osbourne   though the actors are all funny in their own right sans mckinnon this movie had none of the great comedic timing or humor that we have all seen these actors demonstrate in some of their previous works chris hemsworths character was completely useless to the plot and essentially acted as a gag to go back to when the writers ran out of jokes but even then his character was so overthetop dumb that again it seemed like a spoof movie kate mckinnons character was the only one out of the group that i felt like wasnt even a real person all of her lines were either smart and helpful to progressing the plot or totally offputting and odd nothing she said or did was particularly funny nor did it pertain to her character that she was attempting to portray however the rest of the ghostbusters team did have chemistry regardless of the poor writing   the first two thirds of the movie were utterly boring humorless and so incredibly flat i almost walked out of the theater at the end wanting to give it 1 star that being said the final third of the movie was well done and saved this movie from being a complete and utter disaster kate mckinnon had a kickass sequence with the ghosts so i give her props for that there was also a moment between melissa mccarthy and kristen wiig that gave the movie a little more heart which made me enjoy their relationship that much more   overall the cgi was good enough the story was pretty basic the casting was off and the humor was virtually nonexistent i hope the first ghostbusters actually lives up to its rotten tomatoes score
Jul 21 2016,negative,thankfully ghostbusters afterlife has restored not only the franchise after this 2016 monstrosity but it has also restored my faith in the art of filmmaking
Jul 21 2016,positive,consistently funny and supremely good fun kate mckinnon steals the show as the wonderfully zany jillian holtzmann this is a comedy that is truly funny which makes a nice change from most socalled comedies
Jul 20 2016,positive,the trailers for this movie did not do it justice whatsoever this movie is decently funny and a good time unfortunately where it starts to drop the ball is the last 30 minutes or so when it actually becomes a ghostbusters movie good comedy not a good ghostbusters
Jul 20 2016,positive,this movie was awesome i know there are likely a whole bunch of people who are posting false reviews just because the stars are women just let me set your mind at ease this movie is extremely faithful to the spirit of the franchise in writing directing and acting and these women are funny
Jul 20 2016,positive,love hearing the ghostbusters theme brought back some fun memories new cast is pretty convincing and i love whigmccarthey combo effects are good and was scarier than the first cameos are great look for the harold ramis bust should of released in the fall not a summer movie for me
Jul 20 2016,positive,ioved it its been a while since a movie has made me laugh and been so fun and refreshing to watch
Jul 20 2016,negative,awful save your money
Jul 20 2016,positive,i really enjoyed the movie as did my daughter and husband and it seemed most in the theater with us it was funny quirky and most of allfun ghostbusters was never a sacred cow it was always a cheesy movie about dudes shooting at animated ghosts with laser guns as a kid i loved ghostbusters but was never really able to relate to any of the characters venkman was my favorite but in the end he was a man and i wasnt holtzmann however is my everything shes eclectic intelligent inventive irreverent where was she when i was little luckily shes there for my own daughter    the movie did everything it was supposed to do which basically involved being fun id say it was worth the money to head to the theaters and see it there when all was said and done my whole family was disappointed  not that wed spent the money to see it but that it was over we wanted more cant wait for the sequel
Jul 20 2016,positive,absolutely loved it it was so funny and dare i say maybe even funnier than the first  i never see movies twice in the theater this movie will be the exception  it is not a remake but a nod to the awesome original  i went in as a skeptic  i came out as a convert
Jul 20 2016,positive,this was a fairly good movie good acting by melissa kristen patti  kate  some really funny moments in there for those that have seen the original  you could say theres some similarities between the two a rather interesting plotline that keeps you guessing whats going to happen until the girls figure it out themselves good to see a few nods back to the original by way of either phrases used or even well known characters that have come back in different roles theres at least 4 that happened  see if you can pick whos who  hint 3 are rather obvious one you have to really listen in to what this actor is saying and youll just faintly pick up on something youll recognise all in all a good movie which hopefully will turn into a sequel or maybe two
Jul 20 2016,negative,movie is garbage they turned ghostbusters into a nonfunny chick flick
Jul 20 2016,negative,it was literally shit not recommended ruined the sequel feminist suck
Jul 20 2016,negative,a big pile of horse shiiiitit ruined the sequel fuck feminism
Jul 20 2016,positive,its a perfectly fine reboot of an underwhelming original the lesson some great ideas cant be killed
Jul 20 2016,positive,i thought it was a cool remake just as expected from the actors involved not necessarily their best movies but still funny and entertaining
Jul 20 2016,negative,1 hour and 56 minutes ill never be able to get back in my life
Jul 20 2016,positive,the new ghostbusters movie stands on its own its not as good as the original which has a lot of nostalgia for me but it is definitely better than the second movie the woman do a great job of carrying the torch see it
Jul 20 2016,negative,ugh lots of talent in this cast but a horrible remake do something original like bridesmaids this stunk
Jul 20 2016,positive,the movie was really good its my fav movie of the year and i cant believe its getting so much hate
Jul 20 2016,positive,not as great as the original but still definitely worth seeing
Jul 20 2016,neutral,definitely some funny moments but not enough to save it from a lousy plot too much hemsworth and an undeveloped villain
Jul 20 2016,positive,this ghostbusters has a different feel from the original but it stands very well on its own great chemistry between the cast the characters are different from the original movie but they are appealing and hilarious kate mckinnon and leslie jones are stand outs chris hemsworth is a comedic surprise the story is solid and the action is exciting great movie for the family
Jul 20 2016,positive,went in with zero expectations and was rewarded with a funny and entertaining movie that didnt deserve a fraction of the criticism it got from internet trolls  the films cast is firstrate talented and they seem to be having a good time throughout  i particularly enjoyed leslie jones performance as well as mckinnons  wiig and mccarthy were excellent as usual  perhaps if there is a sequel they can spend less money on special effects and let these four talented women flesh out their characters a little more  of course considering the giant easter egg they gave away at the end of the credits maybe a sequel is already in the works
Jul 20 2016,negative,not an abomination by any stretch but a very long way from the gb movie we all hoped for ironically if they were as brave with the story as they were with the casting this could have been a fantastic movie
Jul 20 2016,positive,this movie is so awesome i think all actresses in this movie rock
Jul 20 2016,positive,i blame the trailers they showed most of the funny scenes otherwise it was good movie 
Jul 20 2016,positive,even though we know the original is the ghostbusters i think this one respected that with the allfemale cast great cast funny quirky a little cheesy what made it for me were the cameo shame on you rick moranis
Jul 20 2016,positive,this movie was funny
Jul 20 2016,positive,super fun and entertaining although not perfect it definitely hit its mark at a fun summer blockbuster comedy thriller i had more laughs than the original my main issue would have to be with chris hemsworths character male or female we dont really need anymore stupid blond characters whos major flaws are overlooked because theyre attractive he had some funny bits but a lot of his lines were ridiculously over exaggerated the ladies characters were great though particularly patty
Jul 20 2016,positive,this was actually way funnier than i expected
Jul 20 2016,positive,this movie was very very funny mckinnon was easily the best character but everyone was great at acting and personally better the the original
Jul 20 2016,positive,flat out funny great storytelling  perfect summer blockbuster     its just a shame that there is such unprecedented hate and sexism is surrounding this film
Jul 20 2016,negative,wow so i read all the reviews and went to see this with an open mind and wow melissa mccarthy was just sad her jokes are lame and old think of the green hornet with seth rogen that would have gotten an oscar let me see the cast included the sidekick thats on jimmy fallon it was nice to see the original cast but come on more than 1 sentence i will put it this way i wanted to walk out after 25 minutes it was a dragged out snl skit that you wanted it to end the franchise deserved more than this piss poor acting and reboot and all women cast was 25 part of the film being bad it was trying to live up to hype and was sooo worse
Jul 20 2016,positive,hilarious witty maybe the people who think its bad dont get it
Jul 20 2016,positive,giving this one a 55 on how much i enjoyed this film    i love stories involving ghosts and the paranormal ive just adored that genre since i was little     ghostbusters 2016 satisfied my love for this aesthetic and love of the original movie and it was a really fun film the new plot and characters were not only interesting but the film definitely delivered on the promise for an awesome actioncomedy     normally i wouldnt right a detailed review for a film but with the loud controversy over this film i felt the need to share my thoughts i dont want anyone whos unsure about this one to miss out on the fun     all the new ghostbusters were refreshingly 3 dimensional characters and were super cool especially holtzmann because well damn youll see what i mean when you watch the film also kevin was so endearing chris hemsworth did a great job and was hilarious     if my opinion alone doesnt convince youthe original films main cast is completely supportive of the new movie and all have cameos in it dan aykroyd is even credited as an executive producer     if you had any misgivings about this film i would recommend trying to wipe your mind clean letting any anger go and giving this film a shot     if not this movie wasnt made for you let other people enjoy it and dont shame people for being interested in seeing it like someone did to me last week if you truly loved the originals and arent remembering a version of that movie that didnt exist you will enjoy 
Jul 20 2016,positive,really funny and exciting
Jul 20 2016,negative,only me and a sleeping old citizen left in the cinema 
Jul 20 2016,positive,growing up as a little girl i loved the original ghostbusters however i wasnt the biggest fan of sigourney weavers character because she seemed to just be there as the love interest i wanted to be a ghostbuster and this movie finally shows that strong women can occupy the hero role instead of the damsel in distress plus it was a hilarious summer flick
Jul 20 2016,positive,this movie was hilarious    i give 5 stars hands down
Jul 20 2016,positive,laugh out loud funny  epic fights  good effects  and full of tasteful fan service whats not to love
Jul 20 2016,positive,i loved the film it was original slap stick funny and just my type of scooby doo scary my favorite part was either chris trying to get the phone out of the aquarium or the ally scenes
Jul 20 2016,negative,that was tremendously horrible
Jul 20 2016,positive,this was an unexpected very fun surprise      the allwoman cast totally pulled it off for me and im aware that just writing all woman is somewhat sexist  sigourney weaver aside for the moment no one ever called the first film an all male cast  however its clear that the founding fathers and mothers bill murray dan ackroyd sigourney weaver ernie hudson and others where was rick moranis were totally behind the reboot  and the reboot is good enough that ghostbusters ii is not out of the question  with all of the crap that happens to be in theaters right now like what happened to summer fun hollywood ghostbusters is a welcome relief    i am a melissa mccarthy convert  she blew me away in spy and from here on out i think she is one of the funniest women in films these days  i was expecting her to be delightful and funny but what i wasnt prepared for was the woman who walked away with the film  kate mckinnon was just hilarious and perfect  honestly its hard to watch the film without falling in love with her performance and she really made the whole film for me    in my own semisexist head which i try to amend all the time i was aware that this was an allfemale reboot of the original  but i have to say i really really enjoyed it  it was just perfect and i laughed more than usual of late    ill leave the more detailed reviews for others but please go and see this film  it is funny fun and a wonderful homage to the original franchise  i think all of the original actors directors and writers should be quite happy with it    go see this film  i will probably take my 12year old boy to it and its mostly very kid appropriate as long as theyre not easily frightened by green ghosts
Jul 20 2016,positive,is it fantastic no is it terrible no was it worth the countless hours spent by internet trolls to dish this movie for existing and the huge argument that ensued over it of course not ultimately ghostbusters is an allaround decent harmless comedy for a new generation    the jokes can hit but they also miss on occasion so the comedy is far from perfect but the one thing that saves this movie from disaster territory is its spoton cast in addition i will note that one highlight of this film is kate mckinnons performance i honestly dont really know what her character was supposed to be but she was weird and she was funny chris hemsworth also works for the most part he portrays the typical goodlooking but sooo moronic character in movies and tv though his gags feel tired at points it mostly works and it is noticeable how much comedic potential that thor has within himself you can at least tell that the actresses are having fun and that is a significant quality for any actor in any role in any movie and that one word may describe this movie best fun i understand many may not agree with that with many saying they grew bored of the films antics after a while however i just found myself having a good time at the movies releasing a few chuckles and moving on with my life     because i think thats what some people need to do you just need to move on with your lives and stop obsessing over the quality of some movie we get it you didnt ask for this movie if youre biased enough to already say youre not going to like it then spare us your increasingly annoying hatred and just dont see it youve already made up your mind so dont bother this is just one guys opinion on a film you may have different feelings on thats fine im not against people having different opinions than me    for me this was generally a good actioncomedy flick and i definitely found some enjoyment in this reboot just dont judge it before you see it because you never know    rating b
Jul 20 2016,positive,ghostbusters is not the disaster many expected it is quite funny and heartfelt at times and the special effects are cool but there are several jokes that fall flat and i think it would have been better raunchier
Jul 20 2016,positive,this was a deliteful remake that was actually funnier than the first one   the cast made it really work and the jokes were much better  the villian and plot left something to be desired
Jul 20 2016,positive,funny as a fan of the original it was kind of hard to get used to the idea of a new version but it was funny and it had some scary moments that were well timed
Jul 20 2016,positive,a heckuva lot of fun better than the original
Jul 20 2016,positive,perfectly individual with a wholesome tribute to the original badass
Jul 20 2016,negative,i came in with a open mind trying not to be a hater  but fucking christ they ruined the reboot  thank you
Jul 20 2016,positive,not certain why the audience approval is so low this was very funny some exaggerated action but you see that in all movies these days
Jul 20 2016,positive,im pretty sure i was annoying everyone with how hard i was laughing
Jul 20 2016,positive,this movie is far out funny all female cast of my favourite funny ladies its the perfect laugh out loud film go and see it now 
Jul 20 2016,positive,love the all girl cast
Jul 20 2016,negative,i have seen childrens movies with better plots than this movie the jokes were almost as bland and unoriginal as the characters and the antagonist  which is supposed too be the most interesting character of a story was absolutely pathetically written i wont even go into the terribly pathetic cgi  i normally dont mind a female protagonist in a movie and i hoped it wasnt going too be bad as the trailer and the people hating on it made it seem but it turned out they were right and this movie was really entirely made as feminist propoganda with no understanding of the original movie hint the ghosts werent the antagonist government control bad  if i didnt have a compulsion to finish stories i had already started i would have walked out of the theater i found this movie throughly insulting too both my gender and my love of fictional storytelling  i will never watch this movie again i hope that they lose a lot of money from this garbage and learn a lesson about insulting their audiences intelligence paying critics for good reviews wont save you from this steaming pile of crap you call a movie
Jul 20 2016,positive,this movie was tons of fun and one of the most entertaining movies ive seen this year the originals yes even ghostbusters 2 were two of my favorites of all time but i was excited for this to come out ive now seen it twice sure it has some jokes that dont quite land but overall its hilariousi laughed way more than at the originals it also has one of the most awesome ghostfighting scenes ive seen the reviews for this as usual seem very skewed by the mostlymale reviewing internet so much so that im done even considering ratings on here when i choose movies
Jul 20 2016,positive,paul feigs movie was a romp as weve come to expect from him as a ghostbusters movie it works in a lot of different ways while keeping us entertained in many new ways too kate mckinnon is wonderful melissa mccarthy and kristen wig give solid performances but are they becoming caricatures these performances are nothing new from them and leslie jones gives us her snl personality that can eat up a scene all in all it was a good film but it didnt push too much as if they were hesitant to do something new and different maybe in the next one we will see something fresh from this group
Jul 20 2016,negative,well what can i say about this movie i dont have anything positive to say about it its a really bad movie i regret wasting my time with this
Jul 20 2016,positive,certainly not a work of art but a hoot nonetheless
Jul 20 2016,positive,better than most of the reviews on here would let on
Jul 20 2016,positive,i want this site to be the first place i post my review against the sad negativity of this film because if theres anywhere that would be known for the fandom rant its gotta be this one       let me start with saying im so old that i saw the original in 1984 at the age of 13 oddly it wasnt until decades later that i realized how much i loved it and have made my first cosplay in such theme  also note im an even older fanboy sotrust mei know how much we just like to bitchperiod  this is why im still saddened at the sate of humanity and even fandom with regards to this film  even adding that im also a cg artist going back to when that wasnt common at all i thought the effects were fine  the comedy was onpar  the original was just as goofy  even giving that i hate the idea of reboots almost every time i thought this one actually walked the line beautifully in never stepping on toes to try to replace anything or do the same things again that were done well enough the first time yet also throwing in the slight nostalgic elements too and even actually adding something new    who id love to still call my people have become as silly as religious zealots anymore  its sad
Jul 20 2016,positive,movie itself was fantastic good story directed well flowed well and that special effects were great problem was the cast 2 were good and 2 were awful the ones who played abby and patty werent funny exery joke and most every scene with them was trying to force itself to make you laugh and failing abby was the worst of the two and if theyd have cast other actresses it soil probably have been an overall hilarious movie
Jul 20 2016,positive,this as fun to watch as it looks like it was to make   happy i saw it
Jul 20 2016,positive,loved this movie the women in the lead roles gave me some new role models as i want to be a physicist someday and it was refreshing to see my hopes for my future in such a positive light
Jul 20 2016,positive,it was enjoyable for what it was i just wish they had done some more exposition into erin and abbys past how they met and how they arrived at that opening moment at higgins i wanted to know more about them and instead was left to speculate and enjoy the visuals and the awesome kate mckinnon
Jul 20 2016,positive,hard to believe this is the most controversial movie of the year  four women took a brave step and entered this world knowing it could offend peoples nostalgia  and sure as the sun rises it happened before anyone ever saw the finished product  but in the context of seeing the movie and writing the subsequent review these facts must be mere footnotes  each of these four ladies takes on their role with clear enthusiasm and delivers the funny without missing a beat  the film is more actionoriented than its predecessorsi never envisioned a proton pack as an action weapon but whatever and the plot maneuvers itself in an entirely different manner complete with an actual human villain  said villain is unfortunately very shallow his motives are clear and easy to grasp  he is cartoonish in his pronouncements and is ultimately very forgettable in the whole scheme of things  this is unfortunate because while gozer and vigo were ghost villains they had approaches that didnt necessarily lend themselves to this level of simplicity  and if they did their sinister natures and malevolence were easy to latch on to  all that said what has been put out here is a quality reimagining of a property that i for one hold very dearly  the original is on in the other room at this very moment  but despite my feelings to the original i have come to see that this movie is very much its own while also being a solid homage to the work done by the original four  its ensemble nature doesnt leave anyone out and chris hemsworth has to get some credit for playing against type  its a sure thing that he enjoyed his role and it comes through in his performance  it was nice to see a full eight total cameos from the original cast throughout as well as a couple of other things relating to the original that if you are paying attention youll notice  this movie and any successors will never have the easy nature and originality of the originals and will ultimately pale in comparison as a result but it is worthy of a chance to stand on its own which it does admirably  it relies on its casts chemistry more than the lights and sounds or its action sequences which are well done  in that way it takes after its predecessors and should show even the most skeptical viewer how much respect it defers as a result
Jul 20 2016,positive,a cast that clearly loved working together laughs well earned and a fun ride throughout great summer movie great comedy and great tribute to the original
Jul 20 2016,positive,i love the original ghostbusters movies as well as feigs hits the heat spy bridesmaids so im probably a target audience as a female born in the 80s i went and saw this movie with my husband an enormous ghostbusters fan and we were both actually pretty surprised that it was not that bad there were laughs cool moments a good plot and tributes to the original franchise instead of cheaply copying everything they used things from the original movies but came up with a unique way to incorporate it instead of ripping it off     overall the movie was well done and it was pretty funny too if you like all things ghostbusters you will enjoy this as it pays great tribute to the classic original
Jul 20 2016,positive,for a reboot it wasnt bad  cgi ghost are pretty cool
Jul 20 2016,negative,hands down worst movie of 2016 so far
Jul 20 2016,positive,over the moon about this movie it rocked my expectations loved every moment go see it
Jul 20 2016,positive,funnier and scarier than id expected kate mckinnon did kinda steal the show but no complaints    most of the original cast harold ramis and rick moranis excepted make cameos but i think its engaging without trying to either overdo the campiness or the nostalgia factor theres some delightfully welltimed action sequences where the ghostbusters theme shows up and the ghosts get loosed in new york theme gets used again but its still pretty fresh and new
Jul 20 2016,positive,dont be fooled  it is way better than the original
Jul 20 2016,positive,if you compare it to the original youre going to not like it on its own however it has solid acting and a ton of humour
Jul 20 2016,negative,if youre feminist social justice warrior  this is the movie for you every single guy in this movie is either an idiot an asshole andor a misogynist    whats most disappointing about this movie is that it wasnt made for the loyal and passionate fan base of the original movie this was made for all the man haters out there just a sad sad movie and quiet possibly one of the only movies that have really pissed me off
Jul 20 2016,positive,movie is hallarious i have not laughed this hard in a long time also all of the original stars have cameos which was fun to see how they integrated them into the storyline
Jul 20 2016,negative,big fan of the original movie but this installment completely ruined the franchise the crew tried to be funny but it hardly was
Jul 20 2016,positive,the cast was decent but the story couldve been better some scenes seemed like it was forced not as good as any of the originals
Jul 20 2016,positive,very entertaining a creative spin on the classic these ladies just created some very real role models for a lot of girls out there
Jul 20 2016,positive,thought it was better than the original also enjoyed the hint at the end of credits
Jul 20 2016,positive,nice refresh on the original the cameos and inside easter eggs do distract at times and the big battle at the same wasnt as cool as the original villain and battle  that said the comedy is solid in the style of spy  fine to stream this one as long as those streams dont cross
Jul 20 2016,positive,i went and saw this movie with 3 other people of varying age and personality and we all left wanting to watch it again it was funny and witty with both adult humor and a childish silliness that the original also reflected the cgi and special effects werent exactly top notch in my opinion but overall its a solid movie with a range of likable characters and just a good vibe around it
Jul 20 2016,negative,subpar occasional chuckle forced cameos no heart wasted opportunity
Jul 20 2016,positive,ladies this film is for you writers kate  paul nailed reimagining our 80s childhood without all of us left out of the action tasteful jabs at sexist hollywood tropes via hemsworths character are the icing on the cake
Jul 20 2016,positive,dont listen to the reviews i have to say i go to the movies weekly and i was not excited about this movie but my kids were so i wasnt expecting much to my surprise the movie was hysterical i laughed from beginning to end chris hemsworth character was so funny and so well played as was kristen wig dont listen to everyone else go watch and enjoy
Jul 20 2016,positive,spoilerit was surprisingly good with its humor and plot twists although i dont like how they brought back some people
Jul 20 2016,negative,horrible movie it wasnt even funny
Jul 20 2016,positive,actually  much better than expected   loved having women take the lead   also enjoyed the cameos from the 1984 cast
Jul 20 2016,positive,a rollercoaster ride of fun wit humor and the ocasional jump scare for good measure although it fails to reach the same standard of quality as its predecasor it stays true to the feel of the original with a fantastic new cast that are certain to bring an hour and a half of lighthearted enjoyable entertainment
Jul 20 2016,positive,it was very good  chris hemsworth and leslie jones were absolutely hilarious  i loved all the cameos
Jul 20 2016,positive,i thought it was great i cant understand why people are giving it such low ratings
Jul 20 2016,negative,its an insult to the franchise name
Jul 20 2016,negative,couldve been better if it wasnt terribly executed something that could have been a grand reentry of the series falls short to forceful moments
Jul 20 2016,positive,i saw the movie last night and it was a ton of fun there was a lot of hilarious things in the movie and the ghosts seemed a lot scarier than the original movies ghosts the special effects were amazing and i love it just as much as i love the original movies
Jul 20 2016,positive,a terrific action comedy a fourcharacter buddy comedy with ghosts kate mckinnon steals the show and chris hemsworth is a delight better than the original
Jul 20 2016,positive,way better than i expected i cant wait for the sequel
Jul 20 2016,negative,horrible horrible horrible
Jul 20 2016,positive,should not be compared to the original but should be judged on its own merits for those who wish to reminisce and for those who are new to the storyline its well worth a watch
Jul 20 2016,positive,i enjoyed the movie  the movie moved along at a brisk pace it was funny with only a few flat jokes  but most importantly the movie brought back memories of the original ghostbusters  go see it  you will walk out smiling cheers
Jul 20 2016,positive,the movie was funnier and expected with some creepy moments too  definitely funnier than the original  thumbs up
Jul 20 2016,negative,most reviews trend in the so so category but mostly talk about the flaws this is a sure sign a movie will have a very short halflife much of that positive spin comes no doubt from the brutal campaign the makers have waged to paint themselves as victims when by shamelessly taking on and old franchise and treating it so badly they victimized all of us    best review ive seen is right here 
Jul 20 2016,negative,pale copy of the original to much reverencecameo scene copy  for the original story isnt funny most of the time it look like they took the ghosts from scooby doo as for the cast chris hemsworth was funny even if the character was not helping the movie jillian holtzmann was terrific in her role but her scene in the end where she fought multiple ghosts was a big let down as it doesnt fit her character at all leslie jones and kristen wiig did a fine job with the script they had my biggest let down was melissa mccarthy she wasnt funny at all it is like they use her name to promote the movie but didnt know what to do with her in the movie her lines are awkward especially the soup thing and what about the tagline answer the call answer the call to what exactly they should have stick with the original who you gonna call this movie is like a paper tissue you use it once and then discard it which is the current trend in hollywood
Jul 20 2016,positive,brilliantly funny loved the cameos from the old cast and the subtle references to the previous films watched it in imax and the fx were amazing kevin is a fantastic character played flawlessly by chris hemsworth loved it cant wait for gb2
Jul 20 2016,negative,35 out of 10    it might not be as bad as we all thought it was gonna be some things are actually funny but most of the film isnt
Jul 20 2016,positive,kate mckinnon is magnificent in her role as the quirky inventor with swagger to spare  entertaining funny awesome special effects and a fresh clever new take on a classic  well done  great summer fun on the big screen
Jul 20 2016,negative,the 3d was great but the animation was horrible badly cast horrible acting not funny jokes that for the most part was fart jokes and fat people falling down and got to love how the movie has all the guys portrayed as idiots and takes down the bad guy the ghostbusters  logo by shooting in the crotch i wish i could get my money back
Jul 20 2016,negative,pretty boring movie  i could count the scenes or lines that were funny on one hand  no way this should be 73  it should be much lower
Jul 20 2016,positive,i enjoyed it great creature design i laughed and nice actionheart  ill be buying this on blu ray week 1 please give me a commentary
Jul 20 2016,negative,boring pap the original was way better
Jul 20 2016,positive,while the movie hits a few bumps along the way the stellarly hilarious cast along with an excellent script allows ghostbusters to remain a solid entry in the ghostbusters franchise and can stand toe to toe with the original in many aspects
Jul 20 2016,negative,wait for dvd or digital its ok but not as funny or exciting as you might think
Jul 20 2016,positive,better than gb2  blessed by bit parts and cameos by many of the original gb stars  its not a rockyourworld experience and not all the humor lands well but the veryexperienced comedic and noncomedic stars combined their talent to make what turned out to be a fun summer movie    i doubt anyone could top the genius of the very first ghostbusters but then that movie also broke new ground on many fronts  this movie takes on the same scale as the first all of new york city and features the city front and center throughout  on top of that the modern effects just add to the grand scale of the events in the movie    its good fun and id see it again to make sure i get all the little surprises  it stands well in the ghostbusters line and everyone involved should be proud  i recommend it
Jul 20 2016,negative,absolutely awful dont waste your time and moneywhat a disappointment
Jul 20 2016,negative,sorry but this does not hold a dim candle to the original  just another case of hollywood trying to milk an old franchise due to lack of original ideas  boo
Jul 20 2016,positive,if you go into it comparing it to the original you probably wont like it  its a completely different story otherwise its pretty good
Jul 20 2016,negative,seems like a weak remake of the original movie uninspired actress partaking in an extended snl skit shiny sparkly ghouls give the bad guys a shiny twilight vampire feel i dont plan on wasting my time or money on this
Jul 20 2016,positive,great cast solid script the audience loved it at our theatre i was a fan of the original movies this was not a carbon copy and did it justice
Jul 20 2016,positive,it works definitely
Jul 20 2016,negative,i heard very mixed reviews before attending the movie the theatre was relatively full but sounded empty most of the movie although labeled as a comedy they relied on less that humorous stereotypical jokes i would not recommend this movie
Jul 20 2016,negative,crap the false certefied fresh is proof that rotten tomatoes are sllouts
Jul 20 2016,positive,i loved the original and i enjoyed the 2016 reboot very much as its own film the whole cast was great mckinnon and jones being the standouts for me in an age of reboots and reimaginings i thought this got it right i hope therell be more allfemale principal cast reboots in the future
Jul 20 2016,positive,i think this movie got way too much hate guys really i think they would have made the audience a lot more angry if they would have brought what was left of the original cast the original cast was to old and one of them is dead if you wanted the original cast then watch the original movie i think they put a great 2016 spin on the franchise the editing was great the acting was great and so was the story i do not think the movie should have received the hate it got that is why i am rating 5 stars
Jul 20 2016,negative,worst movie ive seen in a long time
Jul 20 2016,neutral,to me this was ghostbusters 2 all over again and i didnt enjoy that either i have nearly all of the same issues with this film but ill spare you  one thing i will say is this is not the kind of film to have a culture war over its just a big summer comedy flick
Jul 20 2016,positive,good remake everyone needs to chillthis is a solid 2016 comedy
Jul 20 2016,negative,easily the worst movie ive seen all year
Jul 20 2016,positive,hella funny really good action scenes too
Jul 20 2016,positive,a far more capable remake than anyone expected possible even if the net culture echo chamber wants to believe otherwise
Jul 20 2016,positive,its a good film man
Jul 20 2016,positive,i thought it was a great movie it had many cameos and notions back to the original it has a great story and i think if you liked the original you will like this
Jul 20 2016,positive,fun lighthearted popcorn flick with a great ensemble cast
Jul 20 2016,positive,i loved this movie funny oneliners made me laugh out loud not perfect it had a couple of slow spots i would not compare it to the first they each stand alone
Jul 20 2016,positive,awesome movie absolutely loved it the characters were fresh and funny i seriously want to go back and see it again amazing job i wish i could give it a higher rating
Jul 20 2016,negative,l this was a nice long kick in the balls im no paid to give honest opinion so you have to get my bickering instead the biggest tick about this movie is not the actors or the cgi it was the back stab to the long term fans and the attack from the movie industry which they firmly planted there foot and stated that they do not care about us
Jul 20 2016,positive,the new ghostbusters was a good fun time at the cinema it was silly and it was funny at times but it was by no means as terrible as some of the snobby film critics have been citing it as not a film made for me i think i cringed at that good charlottems elliott remix  bill murrays forced cameo    its great for little kids and even better if that kid happens to be female i think its obvious at this point how important it is to have more female lead role models in cinema
Jul 20 2016,negative,below average and a massive letdown this movie is everything people were afraid it was going to be the jokes are not funny most of the time and thats what the movie depends on the painful thing about this movie is that the story was good the acting was good and the special effects were amazing but this movie falls apart on the writing i cant recommend this movie to anybody because it just isnt very good paul feig can do much better and all the actresses are much better than the material they were given chris hemsworth was definitely right for his role wait for this to come to your local bargain theater or make friends with people who work at your movie theater because this movie is not worth the money it took to make
Jul 20 2016,positive,this movie was surprisingly enjoying and hilarious it was good comedy action and horror
Jul 20 2016,negative,poor film bad script bad jokes dull film
Jul 20 2016,negative,one of the worst movies ive seen in my life i thought professional critics are supposed to have backbone
Jul 20 2016,positive,a good funny film not as good as the original but still good enough to stop internet trolls for hating the movie before they see it
Jul 20 2016,negative,shallow characters and fragmented story  graphics are exceptional
Jul 20 2016,positive,worthy of the ghostbusters franchise  this is a fresh and fully telling of the story  everyone in the theater was laughing at the jokes and cheering the cameosthat was pretty cool as many hadnt been born when the first movie was released  these ladies were wellcast and every one of them put in an enjoyable performance  brava
Jul 20 2016,negative,this movie is boring  ive waited for the first 30 minutes of the movie to find a good joke  the is movie is to cringy to watch and not worthy of a full star
Jul 20 2016,positive,ghostbusters 2016 is a very bizarre film  as an action film its great the action scenes though few were well shot   as a comedy film it just falls flat the humor was rather hitnmiss though mostly miss for me the characters were interesting but the story isnt good enough to set them for a higher standard    ghostbusters is a movie youll see once wont want to see again and then forget you ever saw years after its release
Jul 20 2016,negative,movie was a repeat of the original and used all the good parts from it and had nothing new of consequence the story could have been really well done except for the force comedy and the obvious political agenda to the movie
Jul 20 2016,positive,its not the original ghostbusters and anyone who goes in expecting that wont be happy its its own movie with homages to the original but it stands on its own it borrows heavily from akroyds original plan for the 1984 movie though i enjoyed the hell out of it    also holtzmann is amazing
Jul 20 2016,positive,loved the film laughed out loud which i dont often do in cinemas i hope they do a sequel
Jul 20 2016,positive,just pure fun it is one of my top five movies of the summer
Jul 20 2016,negative,i heard the new ghostbusters movie is a total fucking crapfest
Jul 20 2016,negative,if i could give this movie a negative rating i would and a request of a submission of an invoice from my eye doctor to cleanse my eyes from leslie jones
Jul 20 2016,positive,honestly it wasnt as bad as people made it out to be i enjoyed it it was very fu to watch and who  doesnt enjoy a little comedy
Jul 20 2016,positive,its a fun film the jokes are a hit and miss throughout depending on the character and the ending is a little slow however this scifi comedy contrasts successfully with its predecessors in a few ways it definitely doesnt surpass the original which was to be expected but it is still worth the watch    spoilers         mckinnon and jones characters are probably the most amusing it can be argued both of their personalities can be a little over the top for a few seconds however it never gets obnoxious or annoying or slows down the story  wigs character continues to sort of glue the 4 ghostbusters into a reasonable plot mccarthys character was probably the weakest having the least funny amount of lines and actions such as that she couldnt find her glasses when they were in her hand to being thrown around the alleyway when they were trying out new gadgets  depending on how well you can handle dumb humor hemsworth secretary character was also funny contrasting with the useful abilities of the main team his dumb character works in with his narcissism so in a sense it is not as if he is just an idiot but he doesnt care enough to try harder anyway which is effective         plotwise it felt like a mixture of both films with lack of there being an actual god this seemed rather useful for carrying in some memory from the source material having the ghosts surround and attack the city with a large building as the source to the lonely pathetic human assisting the ghosts for power and vengeance bringing the original actorsactresses back for a quick cameo even having the late ramis character as a statue also brought a fun spin to the reboot         at the end of the credits the ghostbusters are searching for more paranormal activity when patty hears a strange sound and asks her teammates what is zuul nobody seems to know what she is talking about if the film gets a sequel with such elements involved i would gladly go watch it in a sense with this idea in mind this first reboot seemed as a kickoff to a much bigger adventure in store introducing the characters and setting up their business in a 21000 dollars a month rental space with more equipment to kickass and save the city that loves them
Jul 20 2016,negative,unfunny manbashing maelstrom of a film this movie was so bad im pretty sure it was trying to kill me
Jul 20 2016,positive,hilarious loved it and better than i expected
Jul 20 2016,positive,better than i was expecting  loved all the pop culture references and riffs on patrick swayze movies  loved seeing most of the original cast in their cameos  guess rick moranis didnt want to heed the call
Jul 20 2016,positive,i love women women are great i know lots of women and they are very strong fierce independent strong beautiful strong people that are strong women are amazing and great just great
Jul 20 2016,negative,awfull just awfull bad cast
Jul 20 2016,negative,while funny at times stupid at others this movie can not be included in a want see
Jul 20 2016,negative,this movie is horrible not funny and packed full of stereotypes
Jul 20 2016,positive,lots of laugh out loud moments great chemistry in the cast close to the source material but very much standalone success villain wasnt great but it didnt spoil the rest going back to see it this weekend and already excited for the sequel
Jul 20 2016,positive,to be frank some parts of this newly rebooted ghostbuster film feels a bit stale but thanks to a fun cast and new direction this paul feigs directed vehicle offers enough laugh and creativity to stand on its own its fresh new and creative i wished people would give this a chance its very underrated  even though leslie jones character appears too stereotypeish
Jul 20 2016,positive,super fun popcorn movie will probably get it on dvd
Jul 20 2016,positive,it was great loved the movie found it actually funnier than the  originals great chemistry between all the actors and they played off each other so well
Jul 20 2016,negative,a horrible man hating mess of a film the comedy was very low brow and dullwitted the acting seemed to be lacking which i accredit to bad writing and directing the movie contradicts itself and ridicules the fans that it should be trying to embrace and as previously stated it comes across being very misandric its literally one very long kick him in the crotch joke find something else worth watching and save yourself time and money
Jul 20 2016,positive,this movie was very funny i think the cast was amazing
Jul 20 2016,positive,probably paul feig best movie a bit heavy on the improve but that shouldnt come as a surprise from creator of freaks and geek and one of the stronger directors of the office the cast really carries the movie and its a shame we didnt get to spend more time with them
Jul 20 2016,neutral,ghostbusters needs more plot while i believe that with a movie like this with some top of the heap comedic talent doesnt need too much to keep it moving there is so little going on in ghostbusters it relies too much on the 4 women on the other hand they are very funny and there is lots to like in this movie   i feel that the younger target audience for this film hampers the skills of the actresses who are known for their edges i would much rather see something more along the lines of bridesmaids from these talents but i will welcome more ghostbusters movies with money in hand
Jul 20 2016,positive,i loved the original ghostbusters so much as a kid i wore out the vhs tape into staticy oblivion i loved this one just as much if not very possibly more i didnt even think that was possible going to see it for the third time this week 
Jul 20 2016,negative,worst movie ive ever seen atrocious acting poor direction terrible special effects and cringing comedic attempts i would have got more enjoyment if id bought a baseball bat with my ticket and beaten myself over the head with it
Jul 20 2016,positive,loved it ghostbusters 1984 is one of my all time favorite movies and ghostbusters 2016 payed amazing homage to it and in its own right made my top movies list
Jul 20 2016,positive,loved it extremely funny i felt like i were 10 years old again watching the original movies
Jul 20 2016,positive,fantastic movie not usually a fan of scaryish movies but this was awesome hilarious and a bit scary with great acting and an all star cast loved it
Jul 20 2016,positive,if you liked the original ghostbusters then this one is full of hidden easter eggs of the original cast props and scenes 
Jul 20 2016,negative,the only thing i like about this movie is the positive impact it might have on girls seeing women as heroic scientists could be very important and powerful for the next generation i just wish it was a better movie of course there were a couple funny bits and some of the action scenes were well done but as a composition it just wasnt working i found myself unable to suspend disbelief throughout the movie the writing was very clunky at times and the performances didnt help the villain seemed like an afterthought the social commentary was uninspired and a too on the nose its like when you can tell that someone believes they are being really clever and transgressive but they arent
Jul 20 2016,negative,very disappointed in this film i had hoped that it would just be a newer version of the original ghostbusters but it was so different the lady humor didnt strike me as funny at all i liked the special effects but the ghosts looked really silly i understand that the original film used a lot of practical effects and this film is mostly cgi but i think the practical effects were much better even though they are dated now
Jul 20 2016,negative,such obvious leftist propaganda  that aside ech the movie is hot air the original like the original arthur blows this movie away      havent seen this much leftist inyourface messaging since the noble savages beat the evil imperialists in avatar  loved the movie by the way     avatar and movies like it are fine as long as one identifies the obvious messaging    its very very dangerous when people dont understand the attempts at manipulation of ones views 
Jul 20 2016,positive,loved it and i am a huge ghostbusters fan
Jul 20 2016,positive,funny and fun  great graphics and one liners  love the cameos from the original cast
Jul 20 2016,negative,non entertaining  it actually not only removed my entertainment but the people in movie theaters adjacent to the our screen
Jul 20 2016,positive,not sure about the bad reviews  thought it was great in 3d  different approach than the original and it worked for me
Jul 20 2016,positive,for what this movie is its really good its consistently funny echoes the original while still having its own character and has neon ghosts i honestly dont know what else you were looking for in a ghostbusters movie
Jul 20 2016,positive,first go in there knowing its not going to be the original give it a chance and be willing to enjoy a fun reboot of an irreplaceable classic  the two main characters are funny at times but are used more for plot progression than their comedic potential kate mckinnon and leslie jones on the other hand are the two characters that standout with great comedic delivery to make this movie both memorable and quotable throw in chris hemsworth who hilariously reverses the dumb blonde stereotype perfectly as an airheaded yet studly secretary for the newly formed ghost bustin team and youll be laughing like i and the rest of the audience members did throughout the movie  in the end this movie separates itself enough from its predecessors while still recognizing points and highlights from the franchises past i think this movie is as good as it could have been 30 years later and i look forward to buying it when it comes out on bluray and adding it to my currentâ  ghostbusters collection  note stay until the credits end for a post scene that points to a possible plot line for a sequel film
Jul 20 2016,positive,first off and this rather bothered me there was a lot of why was that done moments that were just there for a joke or worse largely failing to provide for character building moments examples   phone in the fishtank whys it there who knows oh a couple jokes who put it there shrug   white hair relevant for one scene then explained away in the next   swiss army knife whys it there to accomplish something a nuclear laser cant i guess shallow character bonding moment   haunted balloons was this taking place on thanksgiving no no mention ok oh so the swiss army knife could be used though it did provide mckinnon with a great line   erins ghost story motivation thrown in too late and never really developed    as for the cast they did a fine job the absolute star of the show was kate mckinnon as holtzmann never was i more entertained than when she was on screen she took her character and owned it also fun to watch was hemsworth as kevin no matter how bizzare or outright stupid his character was you could tell the actor was having as much fun as he could but sadly as well as the rest of the cast did they werent given much to work with    holtzmann was the only character i felt was threedimensional though shes not really fleshed out during the story i give credit to her wardrobe dialog and most importantly mckinnons acting for giving the character depth and life you get a real sense of the mind behind the insanity through this and then in almost the last scene she gives a short monologue over a beer you know the scene that just ties it all up together in a little bow this was a fun entertaining realistic within a comedy character her character and performance probably contained about 80 of the character in the film maybe higher    kevin takes the lionshare of the remaining character and i only wish he wasnt so amazingly stupid there were good parts like taking out the glass of his eyeglasses because he was tired of cleaning them his halfarsed attempts at logo design painted a disinterested and lazy personality but then trying to reach for a phone in a fishtank covering his eyes when a noise is too loud it went from prettyboystupid to forgetstobreathe stupid at the flip of a switch and the humor falters for it    the rest of the ghostbusters are blasé erin and abby have little personality aside from the formers need to validate herself and pattys motivation is something never really addressed theyre all a little sarcastic theyre all a little brilliant theyre all a little of everything and none are anything in particular    comparing these characters to the original movie its wildly apparent youve got ray the heart egon the brains peter the mouth and winston the everyman their humor shines in those archetypes and the characters interactions work off the differences and build off of overlap is it perfectly done no but thats a tall order its done very well and the story and humor benefits from it    and then whats his facename rowan the bad guy a twodimensional lackluster boring character the sort of character you can almost forget about while theyre still on screen again no disrespect for casey in his acting  he did a fine job he was just given the most boring character in the film and thats not what you want from your villain    also as a side thought i would have liked to have seen mccarthy and jones switched roles    there was a good timing to the editing during comedic parts and this i think is super important to take away from the experience this film is an objective lesson in how not to make trailers nothing done right in the film was given justice in the trailers while everything done wrong was showcased the film was nowhere near as bad as its trailers made it appear to be    as for the cgi overall it was good in execution but it suffers from the why was this done problem that plagued the film the action sequence was largely boring a terrible word to describe an action sequence but true and the cgi didnt help but merely confused and muddled but the larger issue is i rather disliked the art direction of the effects neon ghosts and a strange bifurcation between cartoony and realistic didnt help set the mood i think was being sought    the individual jokes were okay but i doubt they will have any lasting impact the story was mediocre at best and the characters were utterly forgettable with one or two exceptions its a popcorn flick and if you enjoy it thats fine if you love it cool this wasnt what i was hoping it would be  i expect the movies advertising saga will be remembered long after the movie itself    and as a final thought if your climatic resolution solution mirrors that of sharknado you may want to rethink your story
Jul 20 2016,positive,i thought it was a fun and funny movie with lots of respect for the original movies i really enjoyed it 
Jul 20 2016,positive,fiercely entertaining
Jul 20 2016,positive,even more kitchy and fun than the first hilarious actresses
Jul 20 2016,positive,remakes are never as good as the original but this remake was dare i say even better than the first ghostbusters is a favorite of mine and this movie brought spunk humor and just plain awesomeness my fiance and i couldnt stop laughing and rocking out to this movie and its epic soundtrack loved it so much you go girls
Jul 20 2016,positive,my daughter loved it and i love anything with chris hemsworth in 
Jul 20 2016,negative,i give credit for the effort but it just wasnt good
Jul 20 2016,negative,wow that was cringeinducing
Jul 20 2016,negative,the humor and plot is predictable making it boring to watch and wishing for it to end leslie jones was the worst of the actresses her lines and delivery make you cringe
Jul 20 2016,negative,this is not a ghostbuster movie we shouldnt compare it to the original but its inevitable as its own slapstick comedy its fine but its not a ghostbuster movie they shouldnt say that its a remake when its totally different from the original its closer to the bridesmaid  spy or any mccarthy movie than the original ghostbusters they try to hard to make it absurd that thy forget about what its about
Jul 20 2016,negative,so despite what everyone said i watched this movie  it is another sequel movie potty humor bad writing waiting for punchlines with people that have no screen chemistry     my advice dont waste your time to see what the hype is about
Jul 20 2016,positive,i had a blast watching this movie the fight sequences were fun the actors were hilarious and it was so refreshing to watch a movie where a woman doesnt have to be worried about her looks or winning a man in order to have a spot right up front as the lead its an allstar cast with cameos from some of my favorite comedic actors on tv and in movies right now and many of the original cast members it says a lot that so many of them came back even family members of harold ramis have mentioned how much he would have enjoyed the reboot    all of the women are strong smart and speak with confidence which only makes them more believable as crimefighting badasses kristen wiigs running gag of speaking authoritatively and incorrectly about the meanings of spanish words is a perfect example of what is great about this movie the comedy is often understated and ridiculous but always in a way that makes the characters seem more lifelike instead of pandering to an audience that needs a constant fart joke or a girl in a bikini to enjoy a summer action flick its witty and fun from start to finish    leslie jones has been criticized for doing this role claiming that she is buying into a stereotype which is hilarious because that comment most frequently originates from white people the irony is that she made the decision to play that role because it was a good fit for her comedy if you like her on snl youll enjoy her in this movie    melissa mccarthy is lovable and strong with a clear head shes a great contrast to the rest of the ensemble in a million different ways from her warnings about kissing the equipment to her lack of attraction to pretty boy chris hemsworth she takes no prisoners and makes shit happen     kristen wiig is delightful as always more than any of the others it would be easy to miss many of her best moments which is what makes them great shes not going to spell out all of the jokes but leaves them there for you to discover i found myself laughing at things she said after the moment had already passed and it finally hit me she is the queen of the running gag in this movie as the sometimes oblivious uptight professor type her fascination with chris hemsworth is the only moment when any kind of romantic or sexual reference is made from the women and its spot on she is smitten with his pretty face but not enough to start dressing up or making a move or compromising her work     and kate mckinnon what a gem her fight sequences are amazing she is the unsung hero of this movie with one of her signature bizarre characters both playful and intelligent she is the mastermind behind their equipment which she sometimes uses to mess with other characters     these four women are an unlikely team but thats what makes it great it feels far more authentic to the strong hilarious women i know than most films ive seen     the cgi is cartoony but not in a way that i minded to me it was a perfect fit for the aesthetic of the film this isnt some dark thriller its a summer action comedy there are a lot of haters out there who claim the movie is manhating which i guess just means that the women arent fawning all over the men and crying themselves to sleep in a pint of ice cream of course the villain was a disenfranchised white man look around statistically thats exactly who it would be but there are also men like hemsworth who are totally supportive and encouraging the film is very subversive asking the women to deal with men who under value their work make rude comments about them from the safety of their computer screens and question their ability to do what they have been trained to do sort of like what the actors have dealt with in the plethora of reviews for the movie itself if that bothers you or seems like manhating then you clearly have no idea what its like being a strong intelligent woman in 2016 look at the male response to this movie and youll see that its not far fetched at all it was nice seeing someone deal with that reality in a way that was hilarious i left feeling empowered excited and relieved that i had had a couple hours of fun without being told i needed to go put on some make up or do my hair in order to be worthy of anybodys time    the first thing i said to my friends when the movie ended was thats exactly what i was hoping it would be im already making plans to see it again and have several friends many of whom are actors for those of you hating on the acting who have already been several times i havent spoken to a single person in my life who didnt love it but then again i am surrounded by people who think women are funny and arent afraid of strong female characters
Jul 20 2016,negative,terrible moviediverted too much from the original plot dont waste your money
Jul 20 2016,positive,stupid twitter losers this is a very good stand alone movie with nods to the original hip great cgi and decent story i enjoyed it ss vancouver
Jul 20 2016,negative,why did they make a reboot
Jul 20 2016,positive,this was lots of fun  the audience cracked up throughout so glad they kept the focus on the ghostbusters rather than the special effects  really gave it heart loved the chemistry between the leads    special effects were cool jokes were silly smart and not crude there was adequate character development  i would have liked to have seen more from kate mckinnon  she is hilarious on snl and i thought her gb character was a bit awkward because she was given no development and very few lines     overall loved it and look forward to the sequel
Jul 20 2016,negative,a very middle of the road actioncomedy the film is not particularly great nor is it all that bad some of the strongest moments in the film were nods or cameos to the original which were handled very well i do however suspect the film would not hold up well to repeat viewing because of this     despite an allstar cast there are not really any particularly mesmerizing performances the characters are all obviously trying to play a particular trope melissa mccarhy and kristen wiig are great actresses but you cannot help but sense that they are trying to fill a character rather than allow their natural talent make us laugh there are some good moments in this film and a less talented team of actors would have likely made this a flop the villain is uninteresting and the supporting characters are fairly weak chris hemsworths character is interesting in theory but poor in execution some of kristen wiigs interactions with him are funny but the character is again too much of a trope that gets tiring     an entertaining enough nod to the original that does a fairly good job of capturing some of the magic of the original series without being a total reboot the revamped special effects seem a bit overused and detract from the final moments of the film overall reasonably entertaining but will not reach the cult status of the original
Jul 20 2016,positive,this movie was very funny it had wonderful ghosts it was a little fast paced with some awkward parts but what do you expect when everyone hates it from the get go
Jul 20 2016,positive,these reviews are biased
Jul 20 2016,positive,loved it effects were great plenty of laughs to go around
Jul 20 2016,positive,i didnt give half a flying shit about ghostbusters until i saw this movie people talked about the original like it was some major cultural icon and i never bothered to watch it but this was just so thoroughly fun and enjoyable its been a week now and my cheeks still hurt from laughing so much    i might actually go see the original now
Jul 20 2016,positive,im not sure why everyone is hating on this movie it was very good and had a variety of humor from slapstick to very witty jokes
Jul 20 2016,negative,when social justice matters more than story or characters you get a disaster
Jul 20 2016,positive,i wanted to weigh in because i feel strongly that a lot of the male reviewers of this movie never saw it based solely on their review of the film theres a lot of hate aimed at this film it may be because it was cast with women sad or because people want to protect their childhood sadder when you realize we are all adults here our childhoods are memories they are over if you are protecting something that is over you lack something significant at the present time i dont fully care why    this movie was funny it walked the line between paying homage to all aspects of the original franchise including the cartoon series voltzmans costume design is obviously taken from egon on the real ghostbusters cartoon and a fresh take on what ghostbusting would mean now the humor ranged from fairly cerebral a tour guide talks about how an over privileged rich man invented the face bidet anti irish fences and inspired pt barnum to enslave elephants to plain old prat fall slapstick theres even a hilarious sendup of the internet trolls who hate the film because e gurlz its a fully loaded variety pack of funny    the action sequences are pretty amazing and i would strongly suggest you go to the 3d version of particular note is the final battle which becomes epic    while some of the ghosts are a bit too scary for kids under 8 i think its fairly appropriate for the family superherowatching crowd and thats what these women like the men before them are superheros with advanced gadgets fighting supervillains    i was incredibly pleased to see that there were absolutely no throwaway characters people who were only onscreen as a device to show how clever the main character was or just to scream and run away comically this was one of those rare movies where the side characters male and female alike had some depth and varied in motivation i absolutely loved the main villain he was a refreshing take on why evil becomes evil without being the preachy cypher so many movie baddies become    that brings me to one more strong point of the film the relationships between the characters and their motivations for being there every relationship was actually logical friends were driven to each other by crisis and apart by the success of one and failure of another people came to work for them because they believed in the project or were too stupid to see how deadly it was bureaucrats staged cover ups for political gain and to honestly keep the world from tumbling into a crisis of panic clients tried to actually hide how scared they were rather than just walking up and opening doors so the swaggering heroes could stride through themthe motives all worked and were varied that was actually strong writing it made for a layered script    i think everyone can enjoy this film unless they are trying not to enjoy it more i would strongly suggest you take whatever female you like love to it as long as she likes comedy you are pretty set with this one    personally i plan to see it again cause i know who im gonna call
Jul 20 2016,negative,not even worth my time to write anything  read milos review of it its spot on
Jul 20 2016,positive,its been some time since ive seen this much hate for a fictional film for me my distaste came from the fact that the trailers just werent very funny but i still gave it a shot because ghostbusters deserves a shot no matter what and you know what its actually pretty awesome ghostbusters follows two friends who enlist the help of two women to track down and stop a man from unleashing a ghostly apocalypse on new york for starters the cast is pretty good especially the main four women this is probably the only time ill ever say this but melissa mccarthy did not irritate me beyond belief which is a first the other three definitely hold their own and their comedic timing is pretty good as is their chemistry chris hemsworth continues his stretch into comedy and he has some of the funniest lines in the film and this wouldnt be a reboot without some cameos and callbacks so they are actually handled really well and they very tastefully handle harold ramis cameo which was nice visually the film is vibrant which bright blues and greens and reds which makes the cgi finale a feast for the eyes and the cgi is done really well too my biggest issue with the film was the pacing and editing 2016 seems to be the year for choppy editing because there are some scenes that just end rather abruptly and there are some that carry on for too long director paul feig has already confirmed a directors cut for bluray release so hopefully that fixes the editing and pacing overall the new ghostbusters is not the unholy abomination that many want it to be out of overly nostalgic memories instead this is a film that understands where the original lies while pushing forward on its own path
Jul 20 2016,negative,big fan of ghostbusters series so was looking forward to this unfortunately it sucked vapid plot and way too preachy maybe worth a rental spend your hardearned money on something else
Jul 20 2016,negative,fail  not even close to as good as the original
Jul 20 2016,negative,pretty big waste of time i didnt laugh i wasnt engaged with the plot line i was not even mildly entertained just a major flop compared to the original
Jul 20 2016,positive,this movie was surrounded by tons of controversy and was practically set up for failure by critics professional and fans alike despite listening to any of it i watched the movie anyways  im so glad i did it was so much fun one cant help but want to compare to the previous ones but i feel the reboot gives enough nods to its predecessor while being able to stand up on its own    each of the four women are amazing many of the jokes are dry humor mixed with slapstick and each comic stamps her own mark and kate mckinnon is a walking fantasy ive actually watched it twice in the theaters and i had a blast both times
Jul 20 2016,negative,fails as a comedy  fails as a horror film  fails as a well crafted film  it is a transparent cash grab by sony with a contrived snl ghostbusters paint job on it
Jul 20 2016,positive,ghostbusters is hilarious and perfectly delivered by its cast giving only 4 out of 5 stars because of some lessthanperfect scene cuts and one or two soso moments stuffed into this 2 hour hit the overall story and general progression of the plot were fantastic the characters were a treat especially loved kate mckinnons intensity i was laughing the whole way through and cant wait to watch it again
Jul 20 2016,positive,enjoyed the movie  entertaining
Jul 20 2016,positive,phenomenal kate mckinnon  leslie jones killed it i will be seeing this movie at least twice in theaters if not three times i never go see a movie more than once in theaters ny movie tickets are expensive but this movie is fn worth it
Jul 20 2016,negative,despicable torture of a legendary franchise in the name of political correctness whats worse is all these professional critics being forced to tone their criticism down or face social justice warriors outrage online hence the disrepancy between critics and actual viewers scores
Jul 20 2016,negative,no chemistry among leads if i want fun rewatch the original
Jul 20 2016,positive,the plot was tweaked for the better from the original i saw the original recently to introduce it to my child the 2016 version is the one i will look forward to seeing again
Jul 20 2016,positive,i think people want to dislike this movie because its trendy to now but it really holds up beyond the nods to the previous one it is able to be its own movie without rehashing everything from its predecessor the cast was great kate mckinnon is a treasure leslie jones was a valuable asset to the team and had great dialogue which was one of my fears going in
Jul 20 2016,positive,fun that is the word i would use to to best describe ghostbusters there were plenty of laughs through out the effects were great the chemistry of the cast was phenomenal my only real complaint is that chris hemsworths character was too dumb but otherwise fantastic movie i believe its right at home with the ghostbusters franchise i hope to see more
Jul 20 2016,positive,falling in the shadow of the original ghostbusters has a great cast to offer but not enough needed laughs from the respected talent
Jul 20 2016,positive,i went into this movie with apprehension and almost wanting to not like it however i was pleasantly surprised by what i found when you watch the movie in its entirety it actually makes sense the way the trailers hyped the movie it was a complete mess for the skeptical i would suggest to watch this with an open mind dont expect it to be the same as the original and expect it to be something new and you will thoroughly enjoy yourself
Jul 20 2016,positive,the movie was way better than i expected the comments on the internet did bother me a little bit but as the movie opened impressively with the haunted museum storyline and the thumping music score of ghostbusters my worries were gone  great stuff and i cant wait to catch part 2 if there is any  definitely thumbs up from a great fan of the original
Jul 20 2016,positive,its an awesome movie i lold a lot 3 and i love kristen wiig
Jul 20 2016,negative,this is the most sexist movie ive seen all men are portrayed as either dumb or ass holes then to top it off the ending of the movie is big fuck you to men and fans the jokes feel forced the tone doesnt fit with a ghostbusters film it feels like a failed snl skit the cgi is terrible its just all in all a terrible movie
Jul 20 2016,negative,this is my first review on rotten tomatoes but i had to say something since the real critics are afraid to give the movie a bad review if this was supposed to be a comedy i could barely tell because almost all the jokes fell flat for me the funniest parts of the movie were chris hemsworth which is crazy when you have huge names like kristen wiig and melissa mccarthy dont go see this movie its a waste of your time and money
Jul 20 2016,positive,this is a fun reboot to the ghostbusters franchise it has the right amounts of quirkiness humor and effects although the effects do get a bit top heavy at the end the 3d had some very good moments as well go into this movie expecting tie backs to and cameos by the originals and you should enjoy this movie
Jul 20 2016,positive,refreshing and funny leslie jones is definitely my actor to watch for the future she is funny with perfect timing and has great chemistry with the other actors i cant wait to buy it
Jul 20 2016,negative,the worst movie of 2016 did not laugh or even crack a smile the film relies on snappy quippy dialouge to keep its head above water the movie bores and fails to keep a viewers attention 110
Jul 20 2016,negative,the beginning of the first act is quite promising  the beginning of the second act is so lazy that i was in shock  terrible jokes no laughs boring uninspired villain pointless unfunny cameos and the pacing is way off  it just sits there on autopilot and quickly dies  these are talented people who are involved with this  what the hell happened  some things are better left alone  a shameless quick cash grab its so insulting to the original that harold ramis is lucky he is no longer with us  bad writing  did i mention how horrible the villain is
Jul 20 2016,positive,so the original ghostbusters is age appropriate for old geezers who go to the matinee alone so the turn out was pretty good this is an odd situation as the critics liked this more than the audience for a change im gonna go with the critics here i really liked this movie i should in the interests of full disclosure say i didnt care for the original i watched it the other night and it is still mostly bill murray doing his snl routine this movie that has cameos from the cast of the original how could harold ramis who died a few years ago make an appearance well i could say it is a ghost movie but youll have to look closely is fresh and very very funny all the complaints about it not being the original and worst the all female cast are either stupid or mean spirited this movie has good gags and visuals the whole way the cast is all spot on with physical gags and great subtle humor even the hunk chris hemsworth shows some great comedic chops naturally the cgi is way better but youll even see some ghosts from the original if you pay attention so id say ignore the nay sayers and go have a good time
Jul 20 2016,positive,you want more from this movie that it just doesnt give  weve seen all these gags before  its just not well written or funny  needs a comedian  director
Jul 20 2016,positive,who ya gonna call the reboot to the 1984 classic has arrived this reboot has been widely panned for a good while now the first trailer sent the internet in an uproar and has become hated since the time has come to finally see if all the hatred was needed all i can say is there is no reason to hate this film it provides some decent popcorn entertainment but dont try to compare it to the original because you will be disappointed the film opens up with a very creepy opening that gives this film a lot of promise we are introduced to a mansion with a disturbing backstory while a tour guide moves people around the house which leads to him being left alone after hours to discover that the ghost has awakened this leads into the classic theme song which i loved that they still kept intact to some degree here after all that we are introduced to our lead character kristen wiig she provides a very bill murray vibe in the beginning but that quickly wares off as time goes on we go through the motions until we meet mccarthy and mckinnons characters i have to say i really enjoyed mckinnons performance throughout this movie and she provides most of the laughs throughout mccarthy doesnt look like she is very comfortable having to hold herself back to save a pg13 rating she is usually at her best when she can allow herself to let the expletives fly wiig does fine here but she can come off a tad boring lesile jones provides a boost in humor as the film progresses and i thought she was a welcome and much needed addition to the team i have read the backlash she has been receiving from people on twitter and its horrible people need to grow up one of the major highlights of the film has to be chris hemsworth his character is beyond stupid but in a great and funny way he provides the most laughs in the film especially coming from his interview with the team one of the weakest parts has to be the films main villain his motivations are never really made clear other then he doesnt get respected by society i would have liked there to be more motivation and reasoning on his part the portal storyline never gets much development and it deserved a better explanation because it is the driving force for the whole final act  the cgi is very well done the ghosts havent looked this real in the entire series and they really come to life the final act is quite the spectacle and was one of the films best parts the comedy gets a bit stale as the film goes on and a lot of the jokes seem to fall flat at times but i think its because of the pg13 constraint these actresses arent used to having to censor themselves the cameos i believe were handled pretty well dan aykroyds i thought was perfect and it gives you the idea that something more about this reboot might be stirringit gives a sense that the original characters might have been told to forget what happened or had their memories wiped  all in all this reboot is not as terrible as many would have thought but it still has its share of problems the humor sometimes falls flat but the effects and action help make it entertaining enough for a watch also stay after the credits for a sequel tease that dates back to the original
Jul 20 2016,negative,wig is funny but when she say say hello to my little friend i cringe real original this movie was awful
Jul 20 2016,positive,good family movie reminded me of the originial  funny
Jul 20 2016,positive,if there is one thing i hate its when people judge the movie without actually seeing it the amount of negative reactions to this movie is ridiculous while most reviewers deny the fact that they dont hate it because the main characters are female the opposite is sadly true the second the all female cast was announced it released a shitstorm of epic proportions  i do believe there is a very mean misogynist movement since the backlash first started and carried on through production certainly reared its ugly head as soon as the trailers came out and now it has continued through opening weekend there is a segment of the ghostbusters fandom that is very varied and had existed through decades there is a sense of ownership that is among male fans that came out even when the project was announced and even members of the press werethis is kind of a guy movie isnt it so there is a feeling that this movie belongs to guys and specifically belongs to guys who grew up with it well guess what women also grew up with it so no it doesnt just belong to you and it seems the fanboys never actually grew up there is no excuus for all the hateful comments the cast received not to mention the racist misogynistic comments lesslie jones received     it is absolutely fine to dont like a movie and give it a poor rating but can you at least watch it before all the hating i stronlgy dislike the twilight franchise i read the books and saw the movies and only after that i formed my opinion i thought it was all horrible  buffy would kick edwards ass ghostbusters had one of the lowest scores ever before it even came out so how do you justify that      last saturday my friends and i went to see the movie i loved it my friends loved and so did the rest of the audience male and female we all laughed got spooked giggled and most importantly had a really great time its genuinely a fun movie and as far as a reboot goes definitely not the worst thing ever done to mankind suprise sweaty fanboys
Jul 20 2016,positive,i was one of the ones that simply disliked the movie because the cast was all women when the original was all male and because i simply adore the 80s  i didnt even planned on watching this movie but it was between ghostbusters or a kids movie  so i went with this movie and to my surprise i laughed like i hadnt in a while the movie just flowed right into my good mood i like that i jumped a couple of times 3d but knowing i would still be able to sleep at night the only thing i would have change is tone it a bit down on the special effects with the main ghost and the final scenes and maybe a nice 80s song while battling ghost but overall i was very satisfied and i would recommend it for the entire family
Jul 20 2016,negative,i am fully aware that there will be many who may write this off as some misogynist nerdist rant  the truth is  bad is bad   this film is a waste of time talent and inspiration  as a huge fan of bridesmaids and spy this outing pales in comparison  wiig and mccarthy are flatout wasted not permitted to shine leslie jones comes off contradictory and unoriginal in one instance shes fighting her way into the group a moment later shes ruing her lifes decisions mckinnons performance the clear standout while entertaining comes off as being strange just for the sake of being strange conversely hemsworths exercising clear comic capability astoundingly daft secretary is so dumb it is impossible to believe that anyone would or could justify hiring him added to that one can genuinely ask if hes that stupid how can he survive a given day  it can be argued that there is some notsosubtle commentary on our societys doublestandard with regards to his character prettynothing else however if that is what is going onthen there need to be more of a theme present throughout the film  not just a standalone joke that without any other context doesnt make sense ironically it is this kind of lack of followthru that plagues this film   you want to make a feminist statement with your film   make the statement   but when you cherrypick your issuejoke for the sake of just a joke in this humble critics opinion the issue becomes lost and diffuse   the plot is unclear motivations never truly explained nor justified  the cameos too many and all forced undermine the films inspiration   in fact the most successful cameo is mr moranishe doesnt have one  the specialeffects and riffs off the theme are the most successful elements of the film  i left the theater actually angry
Jul 20 2016,negative,holy shit what a terrible movie i especially hated when the movie previews were over and the movie started
Jul 20 2016,negative,this movie is really bad not even worth it
Jul 20 2016,neutral,like all remakes and reboots ghostbusters manages to disappoint fans of the original i didnt mind too much for the main cast though hemsworth seemed clueless in his role the cameos with members of the original film were just thrown in causetrying to tie things together with the original some how the effects are mixed didnt like the way the ghosts worked though liked the protons uses so many jokes that were dated and unfunny    not as bad as people made it out to be but it still doesnt do the original film justice
Jul 20 2016,negative,its a dumpster fire i wanted to like it because the original was so much part of youth   i dont understand how the critics liked this retread
Jul 20 2016,negative,if liked the original and are over ten dont watch it
Jul 20 2016,negative,movie was bad melissa mccarthy was the only thing good about it chris helmsworth had potential but was ruined by the oddness of his character  his character never should have been written like that and no director should have thought it was a good idea script was so bad
Jul 20 2016,negative,the special effects were neat the problems and solutions represented in the plot were boring i laughed a few times but it wasnt hysterical the car was disappointing considering how memorable the original ectomobile was the cameos were alright and the nod to harold ramis was cool overall wait for it to come out on tv because this was a  pretty boring movie but to each their own of course
Jul 20 2016,negative,rotten tomatoes critics are liars false  gave this a 73  but gave tarzan xmen and warcraft below 50    rotten tomato critics treat us like we are idiots    i think we can all stop paying attention to these critics on every movie they critique there are better ones in other places online  they lost reputation and respect  it is over for them
Jul 20 2016,negative,honestly a real stinker of a movie i wouldnt waste my money on it i watched a screening of this and was bored after the first thirty minutes not something you need to go out and watch just wait for it to be on a streaming service
Jul 20 2016,negative,an unfunny uninspired retread that lacks all the heart and intelligence of the two movies that came before it kate mckinnon behaves like shes on a different planet kristen wiig comes off as bored and melissa mccarthy is playing her usual loud character the only one that seems like shes trying is leslie jones of course that could all be because of a lame duck script that throws awful obvious jokes at the audience one after another painstakingly trying to find something that sticks not even chris hemsworth as the male bimbo secretary could draw a laugh and he was supposedly one of the big highlights     the cameos also feel forced as though the original cast members were only brought in to appease angry fan boys everywhere none of them seem happy to be there so why should we be happy to see them    the only real positive i can list for this halfassed remake is the use of 3d which is some of the best ive seen proton beams ghosts sparks and other things pop off the screen  actually making great use of the technology unfortunately its completely wasted on this cinematic disaster of biblical proportions
Jul 20 2016,negative,just plain awful waste of time terrible actresses and plot
Jul 20 2016,positive,kinda fun actually  may it inspire young girls to be ghostbusters like it inspired me to be when i was a kid
Jul 20 2016,negative,absolutely boring bad acting and terrible cgi
Jul 20 2016,positive,dont be a hater loved it  a good redo of the original  not great but definitely not bad
Jul 20 2016,positive,the biggest complaint most of the people who havent seen the film and only judged it from the wiki plot summary is that the majority not even that of the male characters in the film are more stupid more cowardly or more likely to serve as an obstacle than the main female characters i can understand why some may take that as being offensive to their gender but heres my take  hundreds of movies all over the world treating female characters as weaker more cowardly or more likely to be written as cold and heartless semiantagonists than male characters no one bats an eyelid when one film a comedy with humour that appeals to both kids and adults nonetheless tries to parody that trope by swapping the genders everybody loses their minds the original ghostbusters were parodies themselves of the typical action heroes you would usually see in movies so it makes sense the reboot would follow the trait of making fun of tropes    the original film is still the better film but this was one of the freshest reboots in recent memory
Jul 20 2016,negative,boring uninspired and nothing more   unless you love fart jokes dull acting and piss poor screenplays i cant justify watching this obvious cash grab
Jul 20 2016,negative,i used to take ratings on this site seriously seen this garbage got such a high rating makes me rethink it all
Jul 20 2016,negative,ill make this very simple like 99  percent of what everybody said from the trailer is accurate but its even worse  ignoring and i mean ignoring the biggest gripe that its a remake is one thing   but its not funny its hehe 1 laugh boring  boring hehe i think maybe 3 honest laughs sorta a few hehes thats it think adam sandlers worst movie and its waayy bettter i am a sandler fan but hes made some stinkers  and the ghosts they start of ehh but go totally cartoon like scooby doo cartoon bad  and wth is with the anti man crap through out it every single male was a jerk stupid or both wow     the best thing i can say is i like the actresses what a waste of talent they were told for years not to make a reboot they could have used these actresses and just went for funnyscarysmartsassystrong what have you but instead it sucked   this movie sucks the end
Jul 20 2016,positive,although it was just another unnecessary reboot this one exceeded expectation the movie was very entertaining and enjoyable the storyline was excellent with a funny script as well as awesome visual effects and brilliant soundtrack    even though the movie put a talented cast to waste the performances from the snl collaborators of kristen wiig kate mckinnon melissa mccarthy leslie jones as well as chris hemsworth all exceeded expectations    it was good to see that the original ghostbusters were honoured by being included in the film as cameos    the in credits scene with chris hemsworth dancing with the soldiers and police was very well done and choreographed
Jul 20 2016,negative,laughably bad effects weak villain no payoff dull characters that dont even stay in character bad adlibbed jokes that really break character just a big waste of time and money i was honestly hopping for something good when i saw the cast was a huge disappointment
Jul 20 2016,positive,if you enjoy 90s comedy like ace ventura and the old ghostbusters you should have a decent time sometimes its a bit far out with its logichumor though
Jul 20 2016,negative,went out of morbid curiosity  its obvious that sony has a serious disconnect with its audience as did the director if they had just released an anniversary remastered edition of the original along with some nostalgic products they would have done better    im sorry i spent money on this but if it tanks hard enough perhaps they wont bastardize any more classics
Jul 20 2016,positive,a fun summer flick with a super cast of improve geniuses  its fun its fast its loud and gross and even scary in parts and although it falls way short of the possibility it holds it kept us entertained and engaged    dont go strictly for nostalgia every cameo is a phoned in lame tired drag on the story bill murray is so useless in this role they might as well have had a cardboard cutout field his lines  annie potts on the other hand is golden in her 10 second delivery and there are a few other sweet surprises    the effects are crazy overdone as are some of the repeated gags and laughs  how many times do we need to watch them suited up pointing the lasers at the ghosts while standing side by side  1 million if you ask our director
Jul 20 2016,positive,i enjoyed it  its trying to hard in some parts and not enough in others like the ending but its fun funny and good to see an all girl team doing that
Jul 20 2016,positive,while not being a perfect movie it was most certainly the most fun ive had at the movies all year with a wonderful cast that brought laughs almost nonstop and took their roles seriously while still having fun this movie is a winner that i cant wait to own on bluray
Jul 20 2016,positive,it was an amazing movie there wasnt much character development but it didnt need it because they were already established there were many nods to the original movie yet had an independent plot the cast was amazing and there were so many great jokes over all i loved it
Jul 20 2016,positive,i think the film was a strong 7 out of 10 i enjoyed it and ill pick it up on bluray after it comes out
Jul 20 2016,negative,2016 produces yet another rubbish film
Jul 20 2016,negative,this movie should have been a sequel  all the original cast members were there save for egon rip doing other character cameos  theres no reason it couldnt have been a sequel  theres nothing here you havent seen or heard before there are too many juvenile jokes and innuendos about male anatomy tired one liners   aw hell no  really  chris hemsworth seemed funny at first but his schtick started to wear thin after a while  some inappropriate jokes for the younger ones my wifes niece was embarrassed by the queef joke the villains motivation for wanting to destroy the world is that he was bullied as a kid  they beat him by shooting him in the crotch  rent this on red box
Jul 20 2016,negative,pathetic acting  dont waste your money
Jul 19 2016,negative,worst movie ive seen in a long time wooden and trite
Jul 19 2016,neutral,let me start by saying this movie didnt look all that good from the previews and having yet another remake being done because hollywood has lost the ability to be creative didnt thrill me either especially remaking a movie like ghostbusters  going into the movie i had pretty low expectation because of the kind of comedy shown in the trailer and unlike a lot of people the mostly unknown at least to me cast wasnt really the problem though i really dont like melissa mccarthy my problem with the movie is that it just wasnt all that good or funny  dont get me wrong there are moments where i could see the hints of something that could have been a great movie but every time it got close to being good the movie would throw out some stupid dialogue that i think was supposed to be funny or some extremely lame almost slapstick like joke and it would kill any momentum that the movie had started to accumulate on top of that the writing in general was sloppy almost always going for the easy and usually extremely unfunny joke that anyone could see coming from an hour away and mixing bad humor with an underdeveloped plot on top of that the characters werent all that interesting mostly actually there were two characters i usually enjoyed when they were on screen the first was leslie jones character patty she pretty much had the best lines of the movie its not saying much and was the most entertaining to watch followed by chris hemsworths kevin who did get me to chuckle once or twice  probably the best part of this movie was the scene in the club with the rock concert going on this is the scene in the trailer there were some genuinely funny moments hidden amongst poor dialog sometimes bland performances but almost everything from before and and after this scene is just meh even the exciting end of the movie didnt really have any suspense or drama to it you just didnt really care about the characters enough for what they were going through on screen to matter  i really really wish that the writerdirector paul feig had tried to tell a better story and not try to cram as many bad jokes into this movie it would have ended up a much better film and if it had been actually good if would have shut a lot of people up about the chosen cast
Jul 19 2016,positive,fun alternate story not really a remake in my opinion funnier and better than its predecessor
Jul 19 2016,negative,the most inmature and ridiculous film i have seen ever and trust me this shouldnt be a problem in a comedy however making pussyfarts jokes every five seconds and making every male character a douche is merely the tip of the iceberg of a comboluted piece of shit i cant say more than what angryjoe said in his review this isnt even most of the cast fault but a problem of direction and scriptwritng truthly an insult to any intelligent or rational viewer
Jul 19 2016,positive,hilarious with a great cast each character brought something different to the table and created a nice dynamic one of the biggest things i enjoyed about this film is that it put a new spin on how they came to be the ghostbusters that never felt forced or sequelesque i highly recommend catching it in the theaters while its still in 3d because watching the ghosts come to life is definitely a ride everybody was super funny but i gotta say there were times when chris hemsworth stole the show
Jul 19 2016,negative,absolute wannabe trash a movie built entirely on trying to force me to deepthroat social trends
Jul 19 2016,negative,this film is an incomprehensible mess   its nothing but scooby doo  the haunted mansion early 2000s neon sparkle ghosts snl skits racist stereotypes sexist men are dumb stereotypes and lady fart queef jokes  sensitive types and feminists are the ones who are blaming all the hate on unmarried mommys basement dwelling manbaby internet trolls when the hate is legitimately about how crappy of a movie it is  did i dislike this film because i wasnt amused by the humor yes  did i dislike this film because it was an unwanted remake of a beloved franchise yes hollywood please stop remaking good movies into crap  did i dislike this film because they had to threaten the original cast with aggressive litigation to make cameos yes  did i dislike this film because of how the original creators had been trying to make a part 3 since the mid 90s where the old team trained and passed on their knowledge to a younger group of men and women just to have the studio basically steal the project from them yes  did i dislike this film because of the all female cast not a chance had zero to do with it i actually like most of what kristen wiig works on   ive never seen any of leslie jones or kate mckinnons work and not really a fan of the type of material melissa mccarthy or paul feig are best known for however it didnt help how those two were basically insulting the fanbase   you cant make a bad product and then blame the consumer when they dont like it
Jul 19 2016,neutral,meehh  was expectimg somethig better not worth of 73
Jul 19 2016,positive,doesnt deserve some of the hate solid reboot
Jul 19 2016,negative,ok  this movie wasnt complete garbage but its a far cry from the wit and charm of the original ghostbusters  its sloppy teenage humor with an obvious agenda  im all for a female cast however this film paints every single male as a complete idiot this is juxtaposed with the female ghostbusters who take on the traditionally male roles  i would actually be down for this twist on role expectations if the writers would have had a minutia of creativity and sharpness behind their script       this was a lazy movie with an annoying script  there was an obvious agenda that seemed to guide every plot point concept or joke  the producers of this film attached a well known brand in order to hide its vast defects and turn it into a feminist cash grab  if you dont care about that you can have a few laughs but then have to endure an immature cgi fest   i wouldnt recommend this movie to anyone  even women or any other demographic       i hope we can have better opportunities in the future that provide wit and sharp humor for the admittedly talented cast
Jul 19 2016,positive,it was entertaining witty funny and engaging the dumb blonde trope had an interesting twist the cast was brilliant all of the main characters had their own narratives and personalities none of their reactions were far fetched and everything they did was realistic in the context of the movie though its not the classic it does extremely well as a standalone and was better than i had hoped for
Jul 19 2016,positive,im not just sippin the ghostbusters koolaid here im chugging the friggin ecto cooler
Jul 19 2016,positive,ironically neither as good or as bad as anyone wanted it to be paul feigs ghostbusters reboot brings the laughs scares and imaginative effects but to nowhere as high of a degree as its 1984 predecessor did high marks go to kate mckinnon and leslie jones for giving it their all in almost every scene but its the surprisingly wellconceived narrative that just saves this picture from the middling plains of mediocrity it could have been much better and it could very well have been much worse but  in the end  the simple fact about ghostbusters still remains the film just kind of exists and doesnt do much more than that
Jul 19 2016,positive,i personally was very impressed with the fact that they had such a diverse and amazing crew of women and i can finally say that i feel represented in the media this film also had quite impressive special effects while greatly referring to the classic at many moments
Jul 19 2016,neutral,ill watch anything with melissa mccarthy in it even if its with a supporting cast whos often times more childlike than funny
Jul 19 2016,negative,the main problem with this new ghostbusters movie is not that it contains an all female cast the problem is that the original ghostbusters canon has been completely replaced this movie exists in a universe where ray egon venkman and winston  never existed      it would have been a nice tribute to harold ramis if holtzman or gilbert were egons daughter  retired ray could have passed the torch to the new crew in the beginning of the film because ny is again under siege    the other problem i have with this film is the director paul feig  his movies are too blatantly formulaic  the men in his films always fall into one or more of three archetypes which he is pioneering  1 the asshole  2 the pervert  3 the idiot    the movie also relies too heavily on tired cliches lame oneliners like say hello to my little friend and low brow potty humor  chris hemsworth the idiot is so unbelievably stupid i found the ghosts to be more realistic      i wish tina fey andor amy poehler had writtendirected starred in  this movie  those two ladies are a class act and know how to portray women as both funny and powerful while not feeling the need to demean their male characters    i also dont like how ghostbusters has been turned into a weapon in the battle of the sexes  i think sony and feig played it up to get butts in seats   wait and see this on hbo
Jul 19 2016,positive,ive seen it twice already and will probably see it again
Jul 19 2016,positive,excellent movie with endless laughs as a fan of the original im actually really glad that they chose to reboot with new cast and characters rather than bring back the old team solid acting from all of the actresses and up to par special effects made this movie enjoyable its truly frustrating with all of the hate directed at the actresses in this movie people are judging it before even seeing it
Jul 19 2016,negative,if i could rate this any lower i would
Jul 19 2016,positive,now obviously i had no hipe for seeing this movie due to reasons everybody knows but like most people i went to see because well its ghostbusters after seeing it i was actually shocked how well made and enjoyable it actually was is it better than the original no is it better than 2 yes thankfully reason being is because it serves as a great origin story to the new female cast who of which are all wonderfuland you can tell are just having a great time being there now where the movie does fall is it has on and off humor and it kind of has a pattern to it to where it gets annoying also im a sucker for cameos but im half and half on the whole cameo thing half good half bad because one is cringeworthy the taxi one and one is kind of insulting the scientist one in my opinion also the movie does get kind of carried away with its reputation in the second half by having some of there gadgets either be used differently or have others that completely replace others such as the shredder and the trap also some of the choices they make are either bad weird or cringeworthy such as frmale slimer spoiler alert there is a female slimer for some reason slimers cameo got a little to carried away jokes like i said before stay puft appearing in the old like 40s to 60s parade while he clearly wouldnt be there and the villain is just too typical and clichéd to the point where you think hes possessed by another ghost and theres going to be this big reveal as the man behind the mask kind of thing but it doesnt though i wish it did because that wouldve been better also you can tell that this film had so many opportunities to be good and creative where they failed but i guessed that theybwere afraid do to all the hate that they were getting but in the end ghostbusters is a fun film that has as much good as it does bad which makes it rewatch able
Jul 19 2016,positive,very well done and in many ways better than the original many easter eggs in homage to the first while this was a totally different movie
Jul 19 2016,positive,fun funny wellwritten exceptionally acted  no cheesy sequel but a true new breath of life into a classic  special effects were pretty darn great too
Jul 19 2016,positive,i have not seen the original movies so its possible my opinion wouldve been different if i had grown up with them but on the whole i had a lot of fun watching this film  first the negative the final act was a little weak  too many special effects kinda anticlimactic and honestly i dont feel we needed an attempted apocalypse it almost felt like there was some other ending planned but then someone said we need action  now the positive strong first and second acts where the characters are bonding and working together to figure out whats going on i laughed a lot all the characters were likable and the situational humor was funny i know this sounds generic but its really hard to describe why a joke is funny  its a light comedy that happens to star four women and be areboot of a popular franchise which is really whats creating all the controversy
Jul 19 2016,negative,it could have been better seemed like the director was tired or sick or something actors did bit parts not sure about their characters identities i barely smiled at the end best part was the entertainment during the ending credits needed energy polishing editing etc
Jul 19 2016,positive,i found this movie very enjoyable and i had a smile on my face through most of it all four of the ghostbusters did a great job in their roles and i also absolutely loved chris hemsworth and his performance as their clueless yet prettytolookat receptionist the first half of the movie sets the stage perfectly for some awesome action and an epic climax note i havent seen the previous ghostbuster films so i cant compare but as a standalone film ghostbusters 2016 is definitely worth watching
Jul 19 2016,negative,saw this today and hated it i feel the tomatometer is rigged or broken not sure i can trust it anymore this movie was horrible and unfunny
Jul 19 2016,positive,this movie was fantastic smart selfaware and relevant  plus hilarious  tough
Jul 19 2016,positive,obsessed   hilarious   best cast they could have gotten   i love it
Jul 19 2016,positive,funny and very entertaining this movie was alot of fun to watch and had great cameos the storyline was good and definitely stood on its own
Jul 19 2016,positive,dont judge this movie by the horrible trailers out there there was nostalgia for fans of the first 2 films and the cartoon as well i like it d
Jul 19 2016,negative,i thought iit was trash
Jul 19 2016,positive,for me and my two best friends at 5 years old marching around the neighborhood in 1988 singing the ghostbusters song this movie reminded me of the three of us and how back then we had no doubt that we could be ghostbusters too     and after that moment of nostalgia wore off their were some good laughs and action in there too
Jul 19 2016,negative,dont waste your money or more  importantly your time
Jul 19 2016,negative,its funny but mostly because of how bad it is there are several times the cast made me really laugh but there are so many other times where the movie was so bad i also laughed out loud it was poorly directed and all the cameos was a nice try but fell waaay short of actually helping the movie any a lot has been made about the main cast being female instead of male and many like to criticize the people who criticize this mo in because of that unfortunately the female cast had nothing to do with how bad the movie was in fact the cast was the very best part of the movie it was also great to see an action star like chris hemsworth playing a do of us that was the movies best comic relief it was a lot like jason stathams role in the movie spy that also starred melissa mccarthy though i preferred stathams role a little more unfortunately hemsworth can not help this movie any more the the lead characters
Jul 19 2016,positive,cant beat the originalbut that wasnt their intention  its funny from beginning to end and the guest appearances are really great and tastefully done      everyone on the theatre was clapping when it was over    ps stay after the credits roll
Jul 19 2016,negative,probably one of the worse movies i have seen this year if you have watched a mccarthy or wiig movie youve seen this version of ghostbusters
Jul 19 2016,positive,not that bad of a movie has some fun parts but its up too you
Jul 19 2016,negative,smfh i knew i shouldnt have watched this movie man i really tried to watch this with a clear mind but fuck is this shit bad dam i tried i tried to look for spots where i thought for a second that this may have promise but it just took another second after that for them to ruin that with an unfunny joke that lasted too long or by them just screaming for no damn reason they were so fucking loud and for no damn reason i did like a few things like them building and trying out the equipment is there were a few points where they try to go for creepy feel with a ghost which was okay but the unfunny jokes around it took away from it a lot    at first i was thinking that maybe im just too much of a fan of the original ghostbusters shit it is my favorite movie but no this is just bad at first i was thrown off that the black character was just  another average joe side character again and not a scientist but no none of these characters feel like actual scientists or even some fictional  of brand scientist i never felt like any of them actually believe what they were saying every time they said something that was supposed to be scientific it felt like they wasnt understanding what they were even talking about that took me out of it a lot  every character in this movie felt like a bad cartoon they were way over the top and nothing they said matter to the story nothing in his movie felt original they had so many original things they could have done like setting the story in another city just that alone gives you the opportunity to play with the surroundings and also the characters themselves the best thing about the original ghostbusters is that they all felt like new yorkers and that helped play to the story  with this none of these characters feel like they live in the city and theres nothing about new york that adds to the store here    ive seen people say this is better than ghostbusters 2 but it really is not yes ghostbusters 2 was a rehash of the first and pretty average all around but at least it still felt grounded and the characters felt like they belonged the characters still came off as cool and confident even though they were working with a very average script with this it feels like the only person who was legitimately trying is the black chick and thor everyone else felt like they were just playing around nothing felt grounded there was no straight man woman to play off of here    and the worst parts of me is that sony has misguidedly and falsely marketed this movie as female empowerment this would be just as bad as them marketing soul plane or a tyler perry movie as something black people should be empowered by you can call me misogynist all you want but i dont really give a fuck im a young black male in a racist ass country i have zero reason to hate women if you want to watch a movie that shows women in the good strong light and as actual characters watch mad max star wars hunger games or even spyanything but this  this movie is some old bullshit
Jul 19 2016,negative,ill be the first to admit that this ghostbusters remake was not as awful as some of its trailers might have led one to believe that being said the finished product is mediocre a lazilyconceived tired stale exercise filled with jokes that try too hard gags that go on for 5 seconds too long and lacking any of the effortless charm that made the original a classic that holds up to repeat viewings 30 years later    none of this is really the fault of the cast who have all proven their abilities and worth in other settings unfortunately for them this just was not the right vehicle i suppose it needs to be mentioned that my dislike of the film does not mean that im a misogynist a racist nor a twitter troll its just a weak film thats the logical product of lazy hollywood thinking pitch 25 words or less ghostbusters doing the exact same stuff as the first movie only with women playing the leads why bother just write a funny original script for these talented people rather than shoehorning them into an imitation of a beloved classic
Jul 19 2016,negative,wasnt very funny very disappointed
Jul 19 2016,positive,i thought it was a great film i would recommend going to see it love
Jul 19 2016,negative,ghostbusters 2016  no redeeming values stereotypical characters chris hemsworth was unfunny cameos are shoehorned in this movie had an agenda and using a treasured franchise is not the way to go about it
Jul 19 2016,negative,not that ghostbusters needed a remake but if they had to do it they should have done it well
Jul 19 2016,positive,this was so much fun a love letter to the original while still being something different and new didnt pull off with quite the grace of star wars tfa but its in the same ballpark give it a chance
Jul 19 2016,negative,no matter how many reviewers get paid to push this movie its not going to fool people into thinking its good
Jul 19 2016,neutral,despite all of the blah blah about this movie it had nothing to do with sexism  this was an incredibly uninspired soft reboot with a dull villain and a dull pair of leads  the show tries to beat a jokes per minute record and spends much of its time jamming itself up with winks to the original ghostbusters  mckinnon who i lovelovelove on snl has clearly been told to chew the crap out of all scenery and wiig and mccarthy seem to be sort of walking through this  the mvp of the movie is leslie jones who creates a sort of real character with semi decent motivations  her stuff was absolutely the worst part of the original trailer but that was all her worst bits  all in all the cgi stuff is dull the villain is dull and the plot is dull  its an average movie at best  and really just a corporate money generator with no style of its own
Jul 19 2016,positive,it wasnt as bad as it could have been but i think that they tried to hard to connect it to the first movie without actually making direct connections i dont want to get to detailed and spoil it for those that havent seen it so im leaving it at that     that last thing that i am going to say is dont go into this expecting to see a remake and you wont be too disappointed     personally i think it could have been much better if they would have taken it another direction maybe done a handing off of the torch to the new ghostbusters or something had all the old ghostbusters play their original characters and the ones that are no longer with us would have been easily explained by the fact that they got old     the old characters are now aging and can no longer handle busting ghosts and defending humanity like they used to so now they are passing the torch to a new group that will carry on the tradition     just my two cents worth hollywood obviously has lost their creativity which explains all the reboots and remakes anyway the only thing original coming out of hollywood anymore are superhero movies and the only reason they are good is they are based on comics that were never turned into movies but have been around for decades
Jul 19 2016,positive,amazing  it has been a while since our family has gone to a movie and laughed so much it was nearly non stop from start to finish right off the bat nothing can replace the original ghostbusters but the first movie could have learned a thing or two from this film the most blatant that humor can be clean the original was full of sexual innuendos that it makes you blush to watch sometimes when a little kid walks unto the room and ghostbusters is that legacy you want shared this new film is funny and witty while keeping it family friendly and action packed sure some downey jresque one liners could have taken this to the top youve got to admit that kevins dim witted charm made up for that now i want lenseless glasses too  so get off the couch and out of the eighties and go see this movie the theatres are clear now that its been out a few weeks so shouldnt be too much trouble though it was sold out last week when i tried to see it again
Jul 19 2016,positive,all you sexist ass holes giving this a bad rating to make you feel better about girls being awesomego fuck yourselves cuz this movie is awesome
Jul 19 2016,neutral,i watched this on imax 3d     decent performances from the main cast cant really save this film from its pretty dull script  the first half of this 3d film is spent on painstakingly establishing fairly onedimensional characters and the fighting scenes towards the end is pretty lackluster      wiig jones mckinnon and mccarthys performances are all likable enough to make this film watchable but the story leaves no surprises nor takes any interesting turns      a little fun but overall underwhelming
Jul 19 2016,negative,usually when i have low expectations for a movie it turns out better than expected sadly this was the exception to that rule  i could have walked out 13 of the way into it but my wife couldnt in the end she wishes she could have her 2 hrs back  wait for the dvd but only if you are tired if watching old yeller reruns
Jul 19 2016,positive,very funny and entertaining i loved it as much as i loved the original when i was a kid
Jul 19 2016,positive,funny entertaining and enjoyable with a host of memorable characters and some great lines  his full name is michael hat
Jul 19 2016,positive,absolutely hilarious id been waiting for this years big femaleled comedy  totally didnt expect that a ghostbusters remake would be it i grew up watching the original dozens of times and i love that this film was a completely different setup plot set of charactersgenuinely delighted at how funny and accessible this was while also throwing in many nods to the original an excellent production i cant wait to go back to see it again this weekend
Jul 19 2016,positive,ghostbusters 2016 is a fine movie although paling in comparison to the original some pacing issues and a weak villain mar the film the shear unbridled chemistry and energy between the four main leads makes it a decent  funny spooky time at the cinema
Jul 19 2016,neutral,i could almost taste the conservative tears while slowly developing a crush for kate mckinnon
Jul 19 2016,positive,great fun  paul feig found that magical blend of of an original pov mixed with homage that can make a delightful remake  the cast each on their own are fantastic but together are brilliant  smart  fun cameos throwback oneliners and nostalgia with loads of originality to make it their own  grab some friends and share some laughs and popcorn
Jul 19 2016,positive,it was a fun ride a great movie that kept us laughing throughout  the new cast did a great job holding onto the aspects that made the original fun and made their own memorable experience it was great to see cameos from the serviving originals    go see it
Jul 19 2016,positive,hated it i gave it 3 stars because chris hemsworths part was actually very funny and made this otherwise disastrous movie tolerable
Jul 19 2016,negative,this movie is just pure cancer on its finest form 010 this is exactly the kind of shit that should stay on tumblr oshi far far in the depths of the internet where it shouldnt see the light of day
Jul 19 2016,positive,saw this twice in theaters and if your like me and ghostbusters was a classic the original you might need to see this twice to enjoy it for what it is first time i saw it i enjoyed it but didnt love it it was ok the ladies worked really well together but the story didnt work for me the second time i enjoyed it a lot more i got all that out of me in the first watching that this didnt feel right or this isnt ghostbusters out of me and got to enjoy it for what it is the second time a good laugh it still had some flaws but framework of a decent reboot is there good jokes good acting the villain backstory is weak and the finale just goes off the deep end and doesnt fit right but everything else did it worked and was better then i thought definitely a lot better then batman vs superman
Jul 19 2016,positive,funny and enjoyable ignore the haters the team works well off of each other and its true to the original
Jul 19 2016,negative,shouldnt even exist
Jul 19 2016,negative,the movie is a total disaster  dont know how this is getting a 73 from rt to me most of the jokes were total miss and the effect were the worst ive ever seen dont waste your money and time just rent it for cheap if you really want to see it
Jul 19 2016,negative,great effects but subpar writing and humor came off as a spoof of the original ghostbusters not as terrible as i anticipated but definitely could have waited until it came on dvd
Jul 19 2016,negative,bad script bad direction bad acting
Jul 19 2016,negative,wish i could give it no stars pathetic
Jul 19 2016,neutral,script felt weak and oddly enough kristin wiig  melissa mccarthy seemed to be the weakest links in terms of chemistry  loved the cameos from the original cast
Jul 19 2016,negative,gender baiting rip off of a classic original  good cast but little more than a terribly written greedy cash grab put together to fleece young women out of their hard earned cash with dick jokes and really terrible green screen effects    i expected more from such a promising cast
Jul 19 2016,positive,i wish this movie was around when i was a teenager women not being objectified intelligent brave holding their own and honestly hilarious  holtzmann steals the movie shes your typical mad scientist with a bit of a twist you really have to watch to get the whole wonderfulness of her snark  erin is your typical awkward scholar trying to proove herself and trying to fit in shes the only one that has any type of love interest in the movie and its lightly played upon  abby just wants people to believe her she will risk life and limb to proove what she knows is right  patty though not a scientist is city smart she knows everything there is to know about nyc and she puts that knowledge to great use  i see myself in these women girls need movies like this these characters are believable though their situation is farfetched  this is not a remake its an homage every main actor  with the of rick moranis from the original makes a cameo there are many nods to the original movie but there are very different plots i would say this movie has a better plot the characters are more fleshed out at least poor winston  i cannot recommend this movie enough  make sure you stay until the very end dont worry the credits are pretty entertaining anyway
Jul 19 2016,positive,i found it entertaining each character was portrayed exactly how i pictured knowing who was cast but they all worked well off each other funny and didnt try being the original too much great cameos and hoping for a second one
Jul 19 2016,positive,i had a great time the audience around me was laughing a lot money well spent 
Jul 19 2016,positive,the unstable story of ghostbusters made me question if this was a remake or a new story the female cast was a nice twist but the overwhelming humor around every corner made this movie feel void of a true story
Jul 19 2016,negative,as much as i was excited for this movie i was evidently disappointed they tried to hard to be funny and reach to a younger audience it would be okay for 13 year olds and theyre parents but no where for the audience in between i would not see it again and dont recommend it for ages 1629
Jul 19 2016,positive,better effects  bigger laughs  more fun than the original  loved it 
Jul 19 2016,negative,a horrible movie not only for the movie itself but for the way sony treated its fans
Jul 19 2016,positive,sooooo wonderful loved it
Jul 19 2016,positive,ive just watched the movie and i must say it exceeded my expectations although the four ghostbusters do not share the same chemistry between them as the originals which is understandable given the experience the originals had with each other before they made the movie they are indeed characters with potential and have good actresses that can push that potential along the movie  the unnecessary sexist jokes with the receptionist are a bother sometimes but the amount of references and general structure of the movie is good a more confortable direction and a sequel would probably get those new heroes to a proper balance and comfort a very enjoyable movie
Jul 19 2016,negative,id give this negative stars if possible it was every bit as disappointing as i imagined it would be bad jokes with poor delivery cgi overkill throwing canon out the window a blatant cashgrab
Jul 19 2016,positive,very funny movie kate mckinnon stole the show very funny the ghosts were well done the only ghost i didnt like didnt look right was slimer something looked wrong about him anyways overall great movie
Jul 19 2016,negative,i possibly wouldve given it 2 stars if i hadnt fallen asleep in the middle too many diluted punchlines without enough organic humor plot was too thin acting was eh and it just over all just lacked the fun of the original films
Jul 19 2016,positive,this movie is great its really funny and has some great referential jokes to the first movie i really liked it
Jul 19 2016,negative,honest review while it does have some great moments and it is a lot of fun throughout half of the film thanks to a very good performance and chemistry by melissa mccarthy kristen wiig kate mckinnon and leslie jones ghostbusters is a very forgettable reboot and i did feel that its paul feigs weakest film hes done in a while
Jul 19 2016,positive,go see it its fun and entertaining as hell
Jul 19 2016,positive,i absolutely loved this movie im a huge fan of the casts as individuals and was pleasantly surprised at their chemistry this honestly woke up my dormant ghostbusters fan and ive been humming the theme song all week i know people really wanted to hate the movie and i cant change that but it was a great film
Jul 19 2016,negative,the humor was terrible the acting not much better then the trailer
Jul 19 2016,positive,i thought it was a good idea to change the dynamic rather then try to make a shoddy money making remake the women cast are very funny and dos a great job at balancing between classical conventions and a comedic wit all in all an enjoyable movie but it needed way more slime
Jul 19 2016,negative,paul feig offends me  he thinks i am stupid and  that i will will at his jokes he wrote  last movie i will watch from him
Jul 19 2016,positive,july 15 2016    if there was an official list of staple 80s movies that fans would deem blasphemous if anyone chose to remake them it might include such titles as raiders of the lost ark the breakfast club and back to the future or perhaps the goonies ferris buellers day off and airplane the possibilities seem endless and theyre all relative of course but sure to be near the top of most moviegoers picks would be ghostbusters ivan reitmans 1984 scifi comedy about four single men chasing apparitions around new york city reitmans film may have been made in the 80s but its not bound by that decade its aged rather well and remains just as funny clever and original as when it was first released    so if thats the case why remake it in 2016 well thats just it paul feigs new film isnt a remake so much as a reimagining of the same concept this time with four women and a more selfaware sense of humor it exists mostly independent of its predecessor and with the exception of a handful of overt nods to reitmans version namely with cameos by the original cast which it utilizes but doesnt rely on it finds a way to stand on its own diehard fans of the original can breathe a sigh of relief knowing this isnt a straightup copy or imitation and that it actively separates itself from the first one they can also rest easy because its actually well made and so it doesnt smear the title feigs film has just as much a right to be called ghostbusters as reitmans its simply the 2016 version     with that being said ghostbusters 2016  amounts to a good movie but not a great one it has an irreverent playfulness which produces some solid laughs and a strong enthusiastic cast but its not consistently funny or entertaining while its rather long runtime makes it prone to some dry spots perhaps another round through the editing process would have tightened it up a bit but as it is it makes for a fun but not necessarily unforgettable time    like the original the plot follows four ghost hunters in the big apple as they try to rid the city of its paranormal problem instead of men though its four women each of whom is played by a talented actress from the current comedy tour kristen wiig leads the pack as erin gilbert a professor of physics at columbia university who desperately wants to make tenure but when her frowned upon book about the existence of ghosts suddenly resurfaces on amazon it puts her career in jeopardy she cowrote it with abby yates melissa mccarthy who has continued research in the supernatural with another wacky scientist jillian holtzmann kate mckinnon who specializes in designing and building ghost weaponry with highly unstable material which is probably why her gadgets require a good amount of tweaking     when reports of spectral activity start surfacing around new york and after erin abby and jillian actually encounter one in a haunted mansion the three ladies start a research center and business that specializes in finding and trapping the evildoers a fourth woman eventually joins the team an outspoken mta worker named patty leslie jones who is once again the films only black character as inspired and progressive as the casting is what would have been really impressive and edgy is if the three main ghostbusters were each minorities and the fourth was a white woman nevertheless any progress toward diversity is still progress    one role reversal that does work well is that of the dumb blonde secretary which is fulfilled by a man and played by chris hemsworth thor hemsworths words mannerisms and interaction with the more intelligent females garners some of the movies biggest laughs these combined with the more grounded moments versus the sensational special effects and action sequences allow the movie to stand out and hold our attention if reitmans ghostbusters generated humor by remaining within the silly reality of four men chasing ghosts feigs version does so by examining the idea from a tongueincheek point of view it doesnt take itself seriously and every now and then we can sense the actors and writers slipping in their own comments about the material and how frivolous it is     this is the kind of humor feig specializes in and it works well here though its not as punchy and confident as his bridesmaids the heat or spy those movies had the advantage of more original premises and felt more fresh and selfassured ghostbusters meanwhile progresses more or less along a familiar path the ladies discover all the ghosts in the city are being summoned by a virginal social outcast named rowan neil casey whose ambition is to open a vortex to another plane and cleanse the earth of the wretched humanity that has rejected him in the meantime the ghostbusters try to legitimize themselves in our current era of social media and public hysteria which is why the mayor andy garcia and his bubbly assistant cecily strong want to keep the lid on their findings    all this adds up to cheery harmless fun which is made all the more enjoyable with the special appearances by who i wont reveal and a lively dance show during the closing credits i wouldnt go so far as to say ghostbusters was necessary a better more satisfying comedy lives inside it somewhere and im not sure why feig and his cowriter katie dippold didnt come up with a completely original concept with which to show off the amusing and attractive cast all the actors are certainly marketable and wellknown enough but i suppose that in this age of ceaseless updates and remakes the studio wanted to reenergize their oncelucrative ghostbusters franchise theyve done that to be sure although a completely new brand with these women at the helm probably would have been better still as a ghostbusters reimagining well take it
Jul 19 2016,negative,please no more remakes
Jul 19 2016,positive,was it good yes was the expectations met nope was it funny at times  does it set up for a decent franchise of movies yup should you see it yes why not the movie is fun and would be perfect if it didnt feel a little overdone
Jul 19 2016,positive,this movie has a lot of heart and i would be extremely disappointed if all 4 didnt return for a sequel
Jul 19 2016,positive,super funny great source of quotes smart writting
Jul 19 2016,positive,top script incredibly funny and compelling performances what we have all been waiting for this movie will make a huge positive difference to all especially young girls
Jul 19 2016,positive,pleasant surprise this is
Jul 19 2016,negative,ugh i really wanted to like it too 
Jul 19 2016,positive,one of the best movies ive seen in years beautifully paced hilarious great throwbacks to the original amazing special effects mostly there was one small hiccup but nothing too bad and just a lot of memorable moments i really hope theres a sequel like they hinted at
Jul 19 2016,positive,loved the movie great job
Jul 19 2016,positive,damn good film funny and imaginative
Jul 19 2016,positive,it was absolutely fantastic possibly even better than the original
Jul 19 2016,positive,some of the jokes fall flat but overall its a very good movie with great acting and great characters it follows the plot of the original a bit too closely in my opinion but it has done so much better than other recent sequels and reboots
Jul 19 2016,positive,ive seen this movie twice its amazing i was a huge fan of the original series and i love this addition and its awesome that kids now get to feel the same about it now as we did when we were younger
Jul 19 2016,negative,the movie starts with a queef joke
Jul 19 2016,negative,we didnt want this movie we dont need this movie this should not exist
Jul 19 2016,positive,hilarious kate mckinnon steals the show but everyone else holds their own
Jul 19 2016,positive,i dont understand why people are writing such bad reviews stop comparing it to the original and just look at it as entertainment i thought it was very good those girls did a fantastic job this is a comedy people and i think more of a parody to the original
Jul 19 2016,negative,an unnecessary reboot the industrys term to help disguise blatant remakes that would have been far superior with the same cast had this been a sequel instead its sad that after 30 years this is the best that hollywood film makers could scrape together holtzmann was awesome though but the best part of the movie was the random jaws reference    the worst part of the movie is the effects for the ghosts
Jul 19 2016,positive,enjoyed it not as bad as some of the reviews would have you believe
Jul 19 2016,positive,i enjoyed the heck out of the new ghostbusters i love the concept and the fidelity to the original ghostbusters not to mention the cameo appearances by some of the original cast including a great turn by my favorite actor  er bill murray nice bits by dan aykroyd and signorney weaver and ernie hudson too    kate mckinnon steals the show though a totally weird and wonderful performance melissa mccarthy looks and acts just like she did in gilmore girls chris hemsworth as the beefcake receptionist is perfect im still laughing about his eyeglass bits    we saw the 3d version which i recommend not so much for the special ghost effects but for the manhattan scenes
Jul 19 2016,positive,i cant remember the last time i had this much genuine fun watching a movie the cast was amazing
Jul 19 2016,negative,i was really expecting that this one would be on level with the  original or better butno it wasnt
Jul 19 2016,positive,i loved the movie i loved the cast and the story plot as a fan of the original ghost buster movies i look forward to part two i absolutely loved this movie
Jul 19 2016,neutral,ghostbusters2016 is way better than ghostbustersii but not even close to ghostbustersi sad to say not really as good as the better episodes of the ghostbuster cartoon shows       it is worth the time and the popcorn to collect the whole set  ditto for lowinformation voters who could only have seen the original on redbox or with a lot of commercial breaks      absent the two prior movies and the very strong cartoon tv shows i doubt it would earn back its bankroll    this is a reboot folks they recycled the theme song and a lot of the original plot with some good and not so good twists  definitely some fun cameos  but it was a lot like revisiting your childhood home after it has been remodeled by an art school grad who may or may not have a few addictions     the cast includes the one large and loud black lady whos all over the trailers and insurance commercials plus three white chicks  two kooky phds and a really kooky engineer they banter in tek that would make a star trek writer blush would have been nice had they actually had oh i dunno maybe five actually coherent science lines before or after going all comedychick on us  perhaps such were actually in the script but were left on the cutting room floor    the comedychick thing worked better in the movie than it did in the trailers  couldashoulda worked waaaay better    the antagonist rocked he was well done and well acted    the sitcom dooofusdad mayor of nyc played pretty well  actually saw flashes of insight into the human condition within that character and his female political assistant    chris helmsworth as jarjar binks worked from time to time but mostly didnt    several musicinthescript moments were painfully messed up  example you see a big ghost interrupting  a concert in the trailers  spoiler the band stops playing for most of the scene  spoiler when the poltergeist leaves the room the band starts up again all on the same note as if pause were released from a cd it would have been more believably human if one musician drummer bass or guitar say timidly played a measure or two and the rest of the band picked up the song from that sony couldnt afford the 2 seconds of screen time i guess    on the whole i dont want my money or my time back but it really could have been so much better well see how the box office treats it weekend 2 weekend 1 was 50mn domestic plus 18mn international      be sure to sit through the credits
Jul 19 2016,negative,using feminism as a weapon to sell this low tier movie is just wrong even feminist should have higher standards
Jul 19 2016,positive,an amazing film that is full of laughs and an amazing delightful cast if only these were the ghostbusters from my childhood it wouldve been made a lot better
Jul 19 2016,positive,i was bit skeptical going in but ive got to admit its really good  not usually a fan of reboots but it was clear that they had several fans of the original on the production staff neil casey nailed it as the villain
Jul 19 2016,negative,a disappointing waste of so much talent a great producerdirector team and a cast that could have knocked a great script out of the ballpark but the film was packed with visual and verbal clichés tired wisecracks were shoehorned in and references to the original film were mostly weak and not particularly funny the relationships between the lead characters were forced instead of developed and the absence of chemistry between the actors was palpable in the second half of the film the special effects overwhelmed the storytelling i kept waiting for some kind of redemptive moment of filmmaking it never came bummer big fan of faig reitman mccarthy and wiig but they were wasted here
Jul 19 2016,positive,loved it will definitely buy it when it comes out
Jul 19 2016,negative,nowhere near as good as the original
Jul 19 2016,positive,as a child from the 90s i relate to ghostbusters through sunday showings of the original on network tv and the occasional rerun of the 80s cartoon the real ghostbusters in other words i was a decade too late to live during the height of ghostbusting popularity  as much as i enjoy the original and its sequel there were no toys or videos games based on the franchise for me to indulge myself with however over the years and as an adult i have learned to appreciate ghostbusters and even love it in many ways     so hows the dreaded 2016 reboot to a classic from the 80s   pretty damn good     pros    cast is fantastic you could not assemble a cast of men horses dogs chairs or anything else that works as well together as these four women    unlike the original this movie truly focuses on ghostbusting and a lot of it is pretty fantastic     chris hemsworths character serves no purpose but he was still great at it    stands on its own and head to head with the original and the sequel    explores the ghostbusters mythology deeper than any of the past movies    it feels like an episode of real ghostbusters turned into a live action movie which is pretty damn awesome     cons    is sometimes a little too silly and dumb for its own good    not all the references land well sometimes you just have to let it go    movie was filmed in boston and if you lived in that city you will quickly notice all the familiar locations therefore the wide shots of new york that fill the gaps between scenes just makes things awkward    this still did not need to be a reboot you could have easily made this the third sequel with a new cast and in boston i bet less unnecessary outrage if that was the premise     the ghostbusters are back and they might not be better than ever but they deserve some appreciation for keeping this franchise alive lets be honest  it was fading bring on a sequel i would love to see this develop further
Jul 19 2016,positive,funny these girls put on great show chris is just the icing on the cake go see it
Jul 19 2016,negative,another stupid pc remake
Jul 19 2016,negative,bloody disgusting watch the original
Jul 19 2016,positive,this movie owned its flaws  added to the source material hysterical fun and had me cheering out loud in the theater  these women rock
Jul 19 2016,negative,if i would never have seen the original this movie would be ok  but it want to a reboot of a classic and for that i have to count it in  15  and 25  without classic ghostbuster 
Jul 19 2016,positive,this movie is much funnier than people give it credit for its not the same humor as the original but its funny all the same  the special effects are amazing and the cast is hilarious
Jul 19 2016,negative,people were quick to blast dirty grandpa which was legit funny but this reboot was great looking at this film from any way gender roles reversed or not was horrible
Jul 19 2016,positive,awesome action and it may be better then the originals very funny and a really fun summer movie
Jul 19 2016,positive,anything that can send mras into this much of a tizzy is gold im going to go see it again out of nothing entertainment and spite only fault is that a black scientist would have be better than the only nonscientist
Jul 19 2016,negative,this has be the worst movie in 2016 its a slap to the ghostbuster fans face i aiiiiiint taking that sitting down
Jul 19 2016,positive,pretty much the entertainment i had paid for  there is some off comedy but funny never the less very cool visuals as well
Jul 19 2016,negative,this movie shouldnt have been made its just terribly bad not even worth the 5 bucks i paid to see it worse idea in the history of bad ideas when it comes to movies this movie was a disgrace to the original
Jul 19 2016,negative,disappointingwent to show with high expectations film dragged
Jul 19 2016,positive,this was a fantastic new film in the ghostbusters franchise i think trying to compare this to the original is hard because so much has changed but they did an awesome job of standing on their own as the contrasting characters from the original     i loved the homages to the original movies including the guest appearancesi was rolling on the floor of the really gross movie theatrewhich in retrospect was quite a bad idea i will bring a tarp for the next time i see it     the ladies and gents who were cast in this film did the original guys and gals justice the plot was on par with the originals and the comedy hit its mark every time in my eyes this is a wonderful return of my beloved ghostbustersand my girls and i are happy to see female ghostbusters    heres hoping for a sequel that is as witty and entertaining as this one was excellent job to everyone who made this one happenthank you for bringing some girl power to busting ghosts for this next generation who will have fond memories of seeing ghostbusters as many of us have fond memories of the original films dont let the fact that there was a different version of this movie put you off to it unlike most wishywashy remakes of originals that we have been seeing this one is the gold standard to which other remake movies should be held
Jul 19 2016,neutral,the ghostbusters 2016 film was an okay film that fell very short of the originals magic mainly because the film tried too hard to stand on its own and at the same time tie in the past with cameos which were great but made me miss the original cast all the more and easter eggs   the climax of the film was typical of a action movie but lacked the heart of introduction of the ghost that the first two films did to give them more weight    the writing was too familiar to all other feig movies and was very unimpressive to an audience who has seen this since bridesmaids    as far as acting goes jones and wiig did fantastic mccarthy and mckinnon never really took into their roles and seemed to phone it in supporting roles like the mayors aide annoyed the villian annoyed thank god for hemsworth the cameos were gold but only reminded me that what the original had was special and feig shouldve embraced the history instead of ignoring it    the positive extras were the innovative gadgets and the special fx were improvements  this movie should have gotten less stars but between the cameos and the fantastic job of wiig and jones i deem it an it was alright    it was alright  see it on discount day or matinee time
Jul 19 2016,positive,although not as funny as the heat or spy its a funny film especially liked leslie jones
Jul 19 2016,positive,i have to be honest right up front i am a huge fan of 1984s ghostbusters  its my favorite comedy of all time  it means a lot to me  as such any new version was going to have some quite large shoes to fill  does 2016s ghostbusters fill them adequately  not really no  this is not a bad movie or some kind of personal affront to fans of the original  but it isnt great and your enjoyment of it will likely hinge on how willing you are to just accept it for what it is a middleoftheroad comedy    narratively the movie cribs from the original in some big ways as we follow a trio of scientists  erin gilbert kristen wiig abby yates melissa mccarthy and jillian holtzmann kate mckinnon  who band together with a bluecollar subway worker patty tolan leslie jones to form a group dedicated to paranormal research and elimination the ghostbusters  when a massive supernatural threat to new york city materializes its up to the ghostbusters to stop it     fundamentally this movie was flawed from its very inception because of a single decision the filmmakers made  not the decision to cast four talented and funny women in the lead roles no but the decision to make this ghostbusters a reboot one that abandons the continuity of the first two ghostbusters films in order to allow a new origin story to be possible  as such we are treated to another going into business story where the backstories of each bit of classic ghostbusters iconography  the proton packs the jumpsuits the no ghost logo the ecto1 the firehouse headquarters  are painstakingly detailed at length chewing up precious screentime in a film that already feels a little overlong at nearly two hours     in a similar vein we have the issue of the cameos and callbacks  its no secret that pretty much all of the living performers from the original ghostbusters movie have cameo appearances in this one though not as their original characters  its easy to see why the filmmakers might have thought this was a good idea as it ties this new incarnation to the previous but the reality is that the cameo moments really only serve to wink at the audience as if to say hey remember the original ghostbusters movie you loved  here are some of the actors  the moments are forced and end up feeling out of place because they undermine the efforts of this movies storytellers to differentiate this new version from the old  if youre going to stop the movie every 20 minutes to showcase one of the classic actors and remind me of the classic film then why bother to go to the trouble of making this movie a reboot  clearly you want to coast on the goodwill from the original cast so the disconnect there is bothersome  furthermore the film also openly references elements from the original film including lines of dialogue ghost designs and other visual gags which again only serve to invite unfavorable comparisons     one element that is almost totally lacking in the movie is the sense that the filmmakers have any real interest in the paranormal  the original film has a level of quirk surrounding its usage of supernatural elements so much so that the genuine affection for the subject matter from the creators dan aykroyd chiefly is absolutely apparent  theres a degree of weirdness to the jargon and the ideas that is lost this time around  you got the sense that aykroyd loved the strange arcane world of paranormal occurrences and that spilled over into movie theres very little of that here nor is there an interesting or evocative mythology tied into our new villain youll notice i havent mentioned him much thats deliberate   that said the new ghosts and specters introduced in this film are  at times  eerie and have designs that are just overthetop enough to be actually a lot fun and the most properly ghostbustersy stuff in the movie     is this movie actually funny  the answer is in fits and starts  the humor of the original ghostbusters is beautifully dry with a sense of semiironic detachment it may be the most quotable movie of all time with incredible lines and reactions literally thrown away and underplayed in ways that are absolutely delightful and many bits of dialogue that have become literally iconic  the humor of this new ghostbusters is far more silly and wacky and it even borders on slapstick at times  lots of inyourface goofy stuff thats funny certainly but doesnt feel a whole lot like ghostbusters  it plays to the cheap seats a bit too much and there are no lines in here that will ever transcend the film and enter the pop culture consciousness of society  is that an unfair standard  when youre calling your film ghostbusters no its not unfair  despite the colorful ghosts and the supernatural trappings the movie for the most part feels like a fairly generic comedy albeit not one totally devoid of laughs  the four lead actresses have solid chemistry and kate mckinnon in particular brings a degree of oddness even bizarreness that is a ton of fun to watch  in a strong supporting turn chris hemsworth as kevin the ghostbusters dim bulb secretary proves to have an adept gift for comic timing  in short the interactions of the characters are often very good theyre just not even close to any kind of alltimeclassic status        another unequivocally good element of this movie though is theodore shapiros musical score  its big at times operatic at times adventurous and at times like something straight out of a horror movie  my fear was that we would get a nondescript silly comedy score but shapiro plays things fairly straight and the results work well both within the film and on the album  his usage of ray parker jrs classic theme song is especially nice as he gives it a full orchestral treatment which is often a lot of fun     heres the really important thing the movies failings are in no way a result of the gender of its lead actors  the movie would be improved in no demonstrable way if it starred four men instead of four women  the shortcomings of the film stem purely from the screenplay not the casting  as it stands no fan of the series should find this film offensive and if you can accept that this is decidedly lesser ghostbusters material there are some things to enjoy in here especially the rapport between the cast members    this new ghostbusters is fine its okay but it also surely could have been a lot better
Jul 19 2016,positive,funny movie it had its ups and downs when it came to the plot but it was entertaining as is
Jul 19 2016,positive,im definitely guilty of judging this movie based on the trailers before i even saw it i had a lot of fun watching it the characters were funny and had great chemistry i also loved all the ghost gadgets 35 outta 5 stars
Jul 19 2016,positive,it might not be fresh but it was certainly current  its a remake so i guess i was expecting something close to the original  i was young enough that i maybe saw it once and dont remember it in any specific waythis one will be something that will resonate more with me i really truly enjoyed and laughed throughout it
Jul 19 2016,positive,plenty of potential not quite fulfilled there are the ingredients for a really good movie here but theyve been let down by poor editing and indecisive direction so hit and miss in the extreme but move than enough hits to carry the day a better villain and more tightly scripted sequel please
Jul 19 2016,positive,i have never laughed so hard in a movie theater a lot of the jokes are pretty meta but i think thats part of the charm and something to be expected in a remake also i respect chris hemsworth 20 more for that performance and my opinion of him was already pretty high
Jul 19 2016,positive,this movie is hilarious and i loved all the actresses and actors id see it again
Jul 19 2016,positive,i generally dont write reviews but since a majority of reviews on this site actually havent seen the movie i thought i would  it is pretty enjoyable and fun  of course it is not as good as the original but worth seeing
Jul 19 2016,negative, sums it up well enough
Jul 19 2016,negative,what is the point of a remake surely its to improve on something you could argue that its for a new audience well let me stop you right there and say thats complete bullshit the original ghostbusters is a perfect film and thats why its stood the test of time and people adore it still to this day why would you remake something thats perfect   i literally have no answers for you  this remake is fucking atrocious i mean its seriously bad in every conceivable way it doesnt improve anything in fact it follows pretty much the exact same beats as the original but makes every sequence 10 times worse   my friend ian pointed out that its like they wrote the script on the day of filming it literally makes no sense and the main problem with it is that its not even very funny   forget the ghostbusters element entirely and you have a comedy thats not even funny  i cant even begin to describe how bad it is because it hurts my brain to think about it theyve completely changed who its aimed at and have turned the whole series into a saturday morning cartoon nickelodeon joke   its offensive to the original film offensive to the millions of fans around the world and i hope it fails in every conceivable way   how anyone involved thought that this was going  to turn out any differently i dont know   the script is terrible the acting is cringe worthy from all involved as they are all playing cartoon characters no one acts like that in real life its all shouting and goofing around in front of the camera its painful to watch  the ghosts themselves actually look like something straight out of a live action scooby doo film and the whole tone is like some bad skit from a late night talk show   it truly is abysmal and i suppose the only saving grace is that people will seek out the originals again to remove the bad taste of this piece of shit   12 a star is awards for the cameos
Jul 19 2016,positive,only criticism why did the black woman have to be the only nonscientist     otherwise totally hilarious and fun and the best movie ive seen in a long time really happy about the all women cast
Jul 19 2016,positive,a very funny and entertaining movie that follows the original story line somewhat but also uses some discretion to opt into new directions there are cameo appearances from some of the first ghostbusters cast woven into the script it is worth the price of the ticket
Jul 19 2016,positive,im always skeptical of remakes but my son and i really enjoyed this movieactually we loved it  if you were a fan of the first one this is a must see
Jul 19 2016,positive,a very worthy addition to the ghostbusters name  a wonderful mix of reboot and remake and pays of with the funny in too many ways to list  go see this movie  your spirit will thank you
Jul 19 2016,positive,it was fun for a movie about people catching ghosts
Jul 19 2016,positive,amazing movie fantastic cameos only people ive seen bash it is sexist men
Jul 19 2016,positive,i normally cant stand remakes but in this case i loved it ghostbusters is freshly redone with new characters and a plot that pays homage but doesnt copy the original last years vacation wasnt good because it went too far with the gross out comedy and copied its predecessor in this case its a fun movie the entire family can enjoy
Jul 19 2016,positive,loved it funny focused on the smart lady scientists just a great reboot
Jul 19 2016,positive,i thought i would hate this movie but it actually was very entertaining and fun i really liked it
Jul 19 2016,negative,ghostbusters while not as horrible as most people declared it would be is still not even close to halfway decent  it is unfunny uninspired very bland and quite annoying at times  yes it got a few laughs out of me thanks to the surprisingly funny chris hemsworth  all of the leads have enough chemistry to make some of the jokes and gags funnier than they would have been otherwise  but overall ghostbusters does nothing memorable or new to keep myself entertained or invested in what is happening    people who have seen this movie need to be honest about what they really think about it  its not good  its not even okay  its bad  its nothing more than a reboot that steals every plot beat from the superior original to make money  dont waste your time watching this movie  dont give these people money  they dont deserve it
Jul 19 2016,positive,my expectations were low going into the movie everyone did an excellent job and it was fun to see the actors from the original movie
Jul 19 2016,positive,fun kids enjoyed it  great homage to original  would live to see a sequel
Jul 19 2016,positive,pleasantly surprised went in expecting the worst
Jul 19 2016,neutral,ok so ghostbusters 2016    i saw the thing    non spoilery review though honestly this isnt a movie to me that could even be spoiled if you saw the trailers youve seen a lot and its not exactly complex enough to spoil     curiosity won out knew i d see it eventually but with eh its ok thoughts from a few whos opinions i trusted thought i d give it a go sooner than later    the quick and nasty my rating system is usually    pay to see it now on the big screen  see it on the big screen at a discount  rent itnetflix it  legally download it    dont even waste your time     gb16  rent it    insert immortal joe mediocre its fun at times but very much mostly just another cash grab reboot standard formula its lucky nothing too big was coming out the same weekend  its going to drop hard now that star trek is coming out film    rentstream it or lower honestly think its worth at least a watch but not worth extortionate cinema prices a lot of people are enjoying it i wasnt really one of them but hey cool for those that did not everyone likes everything and thats ok  a lot of people are wrong a lot too though  but worth a single viewing none the less even if its just to justify your not liking its existence     so there is that if you kinda want to see it someday and dont want any swaying of any sorts this is where you get off the boat dont go any further i m going to get nit picky i m going to make comparisons i m going to get gb nerdy up in this shit and frankly i m going to rip a lot of this a part to where you think i absolutely hated this i dont but half way through this you will think i do no more warnings here we go    spoilers and personal rambling bullshit review    now as the nerdy gb fan i am i m most certainly looking at some things too closely more indepth ramblings about how i felt about the film cause i like to write long winded responses its a coping mechanism xd     we have gone on about this film for ages so only fitting i have some final thoughts after finally kind of reluctantly seeing it yet at the same time a strong morbid curiosity to see it    well where to start will drop it down some what organised characters gear effects story so lets start on a good note great note even    kate mckinnon and leslie jones were pretty damn good     mckinnonholtzman from the start looked like a interesting character with very on the nose inspiration from egon both film and animated she was a little too ott at times but overall she was one of the enjoyable characters in the film her tech rambles were nice cool that she made the equipment and the majority of her funny parts did not feel forced there were jokes that were forcedout of place and she was a hollow caricature at times this is something all of the characters suffer from however imagine it though is she was egons kooky daughter gone into the business after her father disappeared how good would that have been  i ll tell you awesome lol    leslie jonespatty i was pleasantly surprised with i fully expected them to push her over the top but she was a good character small moments of very bad writing but she felt the most genuine and real of all the characters probably liked her more than holzman a good parallel to winston while in the trailers she yelling a lot she still yells a lot but it fits fits the story moments fits the characters and its not every line nor constant with what she was given it was a good performance though they still fell into a lot of cliches with her but really liked her over all     unfortunately the two headline stars really couldnt feel the same about    kristen wiggerin gilbert insane sexual obsession with kevin i know venkman was a sleaze and she is paralleling him but she was just so bad like cringy and unbelievably bad they build her to be this brilliant scientist and they reduced her to bubbly nervous cliché of a nerdy girl any time he was on screen to the point of ridiculousness i know i know nerds we arnt the most socially aware people and its a long runny trope the awkward nerdy guy by the pretty girl but this took it from troupe dial 4 to 10 was just so far beyond how the character was in every other scene which i found insulting to the character and generally jarring as she is pretty on the level most of the film  additionally there is this weird scene with the mayor where she goes from being a level headed scientist to a crazy lady yelling in the streets making a over the top dramatic scene then right back to level headed scientist i get its a panic moment there but it wasnt translated very well she is on her own for it and worked poorly and i m pretty sure just to force a few more gags jokes in there because it dd not serve the story in the least bit except those moments the more subtle jokes she made were actually pretty well done and when wigg wasnt forcing it i actually enjoyed her screen presence but really feel the editingscript let her down and wish they would have let her play more the character and less the cliche cartoon     melissa mccarthyabby yates on a whole was better than i expected clearly the ray type and other than a few forced jokes here n there wasnt bad wasnt great but i didnt find her irritating she made a few good jokes here in there but the same with wigggilbert the start of the film the two of them just seem to go off on adlib tangents that rocked the pace of the film and were just out of character a little too much for myself those scenes didnt seem like abby and erin joking with each other it was more mccarthy and wigg trying to out do each other     kevin kevin was possibly the worst like i dont think adam sandler could have done a worst job here i ll get into that more in a down the line though    the villain rowan was just garbage this isnt just a problem in ghostbusters though seriously where have all the good villains tired of these garbage villains    the cameos were ok i liked dans it felt as though he still could have been ray in that scene just sitting back because the citygovernment shut em down and had them forgotten about annie potts was perfect segourneys was funny but felt more like a snl skit than a part of the film wasnt a fan of murrays and did they kill him cause that was very casual if they did no remorse from the girls just a string of bad jokes ernies was ok nothing special so should have had him pull up in the original caddy not another new one still deck it out as a hearse but would have been a nice touch to the films credit most of the nods to the original were nicely done also was that ivan in the back of the new report recreating the guy who wandered in in the original i think it was also nice subtle double reference there if it was    the equipment building was pretty cool though really liked the way holtzman was into building it all lot of the ideas and jargon she used were good throw backs most pretty subtle i have one major gripe about the tech though they destroy ghosts which a follow up may resolve this particular gripe but there is an entire story arc in the ghostbuster comics that goes over why doing this is a terrible idea and it really irked me the entire time this was happening also so do they catch ghosts or destroy ghosts both they have traps but in the end didnt use them but then buit a containment unit but why trap if youre just going to destroy why destroy if you can trap in the comics the ghost smashers did it to out shine the ghostbusters and it backfired hard you cant destroy ghosts really in egons words only temporarily atomising the ghosts and they would reconstitute themselves this lead to all those atomised ghosts later pooling together to make a mega ghost a very comic story but part of the lore and science of ghostbusters that really irked me during the film didnt take me out of the film and its a very gb nerd gripe but still as said in the sequel they may use this as part of the story if so well done well done they got ridiculous at the end as well it made for a fun sequence but the proton packs basically have no weight or even exists it seems with all the rolls they are doing and running around wearing them is the most hated part of the business lol again this is a bit more of a nerdy gripe but none of them bar kevin are super athletes and earlier in the film they were complaining about them to being able to do crazy rolls in them just a continuity annoyance not one that took me completely out cause it was a very fun sequence in the film but anyone whos ever worn a proton pack you immediately think nah you aint doing all that lol     the ecto1 cause lets be real here the ecto is just as much a part of and character of the franchise its still meh almost a good visual representation of the film over all has some nice shiny parts to it that look cool but then some really distracting over the top parts that stupd yellow light laced with some sadly low effort bad parts very non iconic siren i wanna like it but just cant find enough reasons to which if you have to look for reasons to like something you really dont like it do you    slimer well hes there no better no worse really eats some hot dogs steals the ecto very rgb of him think i even heard an rgb slimer sound when he did it why did they make a girl slimer though i dont know guess cause hey its gb16  were making this for the girls so make everything a girl counter part cause only girls can relate to girls if we dont have a girl they cant relate and if they cant relate they wont buy the toys serously i honestly thing that was their line of thought gotta remember too as much as the original is a classic gb is still living well because of the cartoon and toys     they took a horrible choice in direction with their ghosteffects designs i respect that fiege tried to go practical as much as he could but the mesh between practical and digital was too dissimilar the practical slime didnt match up with the digital or in some cases the cgi completely masked any practical at negating the point of even doing the practical at all apparently they had a crazy animatronic slimer which sounds awesome but they cgied it to hell that you cant tell a better balance between the two should have been found everything was more like bad direct to syfy effects than major film studio the style was just not for me either the ghosts looked too cartoony didnt mesh with the real world which took me out of it more than it should it doesnt exactly take you out of the film persay but does make you feel like youre watching haunted mansion or scooby doo     cheap use of jump scares with loud noises simply just cheap that goes for any film this had a few moment though where it was loud enough i m pretty sure the theater speakers cracked why why are these even in here     story n shit its pretty bland on the over all the whole start of the film is bit cringe worthy mccarthy and wigg just were too much at times with forced jokes almost as if they were trying to one up one another    the dead horse in the room one that i m probably going to piss some people off about with this this movie is sexist as shit and i dont just mean towards men though every dude in this movie is written absolutely terribly and its clearly done on purpose that giving them maybe more credit than deserved doing so on purpose means there was forethought and many of these characters do not seem to have much thought put into them most are just hollow shells of cliches   i ve seen so many people counter this with well women have been written in the assholebitch or idiot characters for decades  are you all really using the two wrongs make a right defence this is why humanity is still in such a mess sorry people are shit but we cant just keep on going being shit or ha got you back for being shit by being shit for all time gahh seriously if youre defence is this just go just go away i dont even want to waste the effort in explaining how wrong you are both men and women though have these terribly written lines just playing up to sexist cliches all through out the film whether it be big dumb pretty thor gushy i m trying to be adorkable and clumsy nerd girl erin that suck up weird secretary seriously i did not understand that character at all get she is suppose to be like gbiis mayors assistant but like why was she so poorly written and beyond ott acted why did they writedirector her in this manner it very much perplexed me all the school administration just gah hot stinky garbage     i was actually really hoping fieg was going to come out shining being better than his haters with this but the way they portrayed specifically men was slightly shocking i really did not expect this film to push girl power by pushing others down over the months i wanted to do my best to keep an open mind about fieg whos films over all are very hit and miss for me but he was doing his best to reach out to fans and win them over and i really respected the effort he was putting forward and wanted to at minimum do the same but bro you seriously directed a film with this many sexist assholes in it was it to get back at the haters why why oh why did you get this petty i really thought you were so much smarter than this you did freaks and geeks i sadly harp on this harder than any other point more so because well this is sadly what sony what paul fieg had us all focusing on prior to this film how the world is against this film everyone is sexist against these women they fed the hate train so well to get headlines for this film and then drop a hypocritcal piece of weak writing onto the film reels and most of the world wont say a thing because if you do you have an army coming to your door calling you a hater a sexist its already happend while yes its fucking disgusting what people are saying about these women the proreboot side have been equally as bad as perpetuating the hatred with this films promotion and continuing it in its reviews wow that is derailing all over the place but he drama on this shit is just annoying every side every angle ever point of view of it     pressing past that rant the story beyond that is very much very weak and petty this movie could have been really good like i can feel the actors have a passion for the project  and as much as i dislike the idea of a reboot i think these women could have pulled off something that would have been just as well remembered as the original when they arnt pushing clearly forced lines or badly edited in adlib they really do have great chemistry together probably better chemistry even then the original crew but instead theres this false agendas threaded behind them thats just ugly and unnecessary sullying their performances with a half ass written story its one part soulless money making cash grab from the studio and one part half ass rebellious strike at the man from fieg and dipole its a real shame for the actors to get stuck in the middle of two directions that dont make a great film and they really have all the ingredients here to actually make a good film in fact i would even pay good money to put these women in the hands of a good team and see them take another stab at this but other than a few times the actresses performances got a chance shine through nothing feels like the over arcing goal was ever to make a great film just one good enough to let them milk a sequel the film was an excellent fan film is the best description i believe i ve seen for this film over all     as i said the film over all mediocre which is the most disappointing thing even more after seeing it and see the bits of good even great that shine through every now and again    there is a lot of potential in this film sadly taken down hard by this films faults even as a reboot which that alone i really really dislike but this actually has decent potential to have really stood out in a world filled with meh reboots    all this said and i ve ripped hard in to a few areas very hard yes this is just a film but this is a film in a very long running franchise so thats part of the package you get when you pick up a franchise you get compared you have to compete with your predecessors and you have high expectations for your film if this would have came out under any other name it would have gone under most radars easily made some money maybe even a sequel just another paul fieg film in the bucket some cash but they wanted that gb brand they wanted the big bucks so here we are in this franchise its mediocre honestly as a film even its just ok   do i want it to be mediocre no i d love to love this film and wish i did its all there was just poorly mishandled in my opinion     it has some very great elements to it and as i said the actresses really do have some amazing chemistry together when they are not force feeding unnecessary jokes to the camera their natural humor and chemistry could have carried this film waaaayy farther and way better then a lot of the scripted gags that were thrown in there     lastly there is little point in bitching about something if you cannot or will not at least try and offer a solution to the problems     first get rid of fieg and dipole they hurt this film paul i really feel and its the communities fault as well got more wrapped up in the drama of the film than in making the film the best it could be get a different director and writer ones more suited to sarcasm and subtle humor this franchise isnt above low brow but its not sandler humor its closer to monty python dont write the jokes in so forcefully direct the cast wisely but trust them to be funny this film made the same mistakes with forced comedy as gbii did     keep this cast i firmly believe these women could make an outstanding ghostbusters film given the chance    unite the universes stupid stupid stuuuupppiiiddd mistake making this film its own especially with the amount of fan teasing they did even the film as it is with minimal editing could still exist in the original universe but instead it was catered to fiegs ego to it be his universe just for him to do most of the film poorly fan film remaking parts of the original so the girls could go through the experience of making their own equipment not just getting hand me downs such a shit excuse lol holtzman was the only one really to make anything and they never really showed her making any of it just puking out techno babble have the bad ass lady upgrade the old kit and then go on to create all the new shit as well done     but that poor mans excuse aside the film is out done i you everyone has to accept that fact so being that it does cross rift baby have them open a rift in fact this should have been the end credit scene  speaking of fellow gb heads shouldnt that have been gozer not zuul  anyway imagine them in the fire house playing with tech holtzman doing her thing sigourney still there even helping her no words just some piano music but then blam ooops tear in the fabric of the universe other side of the portal the original fire house sigourney face to face with dana pete ray winston janine all standing there standing there looking back from within their firehouse original ecto gleaming in the background no one saying anything an ecig drops from rays mouth and then pete says well theres something you dont see everyday boom screen to black you have your reboot you tied your universes all fans are like wtf talking and speculating for daaayyyss and despite how much anyone dislikes this film butts are in seats for the sequel cause you dropped on bomb ass of an end credits scene     give patty more screen time give holtzman more dimension keep gilbert consistent and let mccarthy out of her comedy box she can do more than what she is known for and i think shes actually probably better at it    give that pound land ecto a proper light bar and actually make an iconic siren hell even using the originals would be better than that after thought unamerican siren get your lore straight do you trap or do you destroy if you destroy are there consequences  lol not a lot but it is nearly everything at the same time     i really didnt hate this film and really do think its worth at least a single viewing but its going to be forgotten really quickly   i do however hope it gets a sequel as there is so much potential and i honestly would like to see these characters again just in a better written and directed film is all
Jul 19 2016,positive,the movie was so good i wanted to just sit their and wait for it to start playing again  i love when movies do that
Jul 19 2016,negative,wow just wow this is not a women empowerment flick this is just pitiful i paid to see leslie jones act every bit the bad stereotypes they want people to forget about i should have just have watched all the crazies protesting the rnc on tv instead and dont get me started on melissa mccarthy aka the lovechild of chris farley and every single fat drunk trailer trash uncle out there save your money and go watch the secret lives of pets
Jul 19 2016,negative,uninspired unoriginal and toilet humor that is on par with what you get from most adam sandler films post happy gilmore ghostbusters 2016 is a rental
Jul 19 2016,negative,worst film in a long time
Jul 19 2016,positive,great reboot totally worth the watch and buy great comedy same great feeling from the originals while being completely up to date
Jul 19 2016,positive,the plot characters and overall story arc are quite refreshing and while living up to a classic isnt easy this new film does an excellent job of keeping a similar comedic feeling and establishing a completely new story
Jul 19 2016,positive,brilliant and so funny
Jul 19 2016,negative,awful movie sad attempt to cash in on a popular series
Jul 19 2016,positive,if you liked and remember the original this movie is totally worth it and definitely made me laugh throughout my wife is a bit younger and got tired of the some of the characters being annoying i dont think she remembers the original so well have to have her watch it and remember how annoying those characters could be at times overall they did a great job they were able to match the juvenile humor of the first movie but definitely felt the womens touch which was much appreciated im very glad the characters werent female versions of the original ghostbusters
Jul 19 2016,positive,i dont understand why more people didnt like this flick  i thought the writing was hilarious and the reboot stayed true to the original  these ladies did a great job
Jul 19 2016,positive,the funnest and funniest movie of the summer not being a fanboy of the original i wasnt tied down to any particular ideals of how this movie should play so i was thoroughly entertained some jokes fall flat and there are the expected and gratuitous cameos but the cast chemistry meshes well and gives viewers a fun 2 hour escape
Jul 19 2016,positive,not sure why some ppl are saying this movie sucked it was the best movie ive seen this year dont listen to old boring critics that dont understand this type of comedy go see it you wont regret it
Jul 19 2016,positive,amazing and hilarious patty tolan leslie jones and jillian holzmann kate mckinnon are my new favourite people 
Jul 19 2016,negative,this film cannot stand alone on its own two feet as it constantly reminds the audience of the first two ghostbusters movies  the jokes are not funny   this is not a film that you take your children to see it claims to be targeted towards children yet opens with a queef joke   it is little more than a parody of the ghostbusters franchise than a true successor to the established universe  everything in this movie is forced at the audience including the cameos and callbacks to the original films  the team displays no chemistry there is very little plot the villain is lackluster and one of the worst villains seen in a movie thus far  the entire movie has no direction or knows what direction to take  the entirety of the film is used two other parody or make mention of superior films kama making the audience wonder why they arent watching these films rather than this reboot  upon viewing it is inevitable not to notice the poor script and terrible editing  this film is nothing more than scary movie 6 using a ghostbusters skin as its central theme
Jul 19 2016,positive,heres the bottom line i laughed a lot    its a big budget remake of a successful movie so you can expect a safe plot safe characters and visuals that make the original look like a student film the worst parts were the sloppy cameos by every actor they could find from the original movie but the characters are fun to watch and its more entertaining than the average comedy     the all woman team is probably the best thing about this movie     worth seeing
Jul 19 2016,negative,super boring not funny i fell asleep half way through the movie
Jul 19 2016,positive,i have to be honest here i bashed this movie and said i wouldnt go see it in theaters when i found out it was gonna be an all female cast and none of the original team was interested in even being apart of it they all eventually changed their minds and agreed to do it it was very cool to see murray aykroyd weaver hudson and even the original secretary for the guys annie potts make brief cameos murray was always against a new ghostbusters movie after seeing it i ended up liking it holtzmann is definitely my favorite new ghostbuster and was thrilled to see slimer on the big screen again stay puft marshmallow man even made a short appearance i would recommend this to any fans of the original classic franchise films i still aint afraid of no ghosts
Jul 19 2016,positive,awesome cute and funny
Jul 19 2016,positive,i still like the original more but this cast and director did a nice job with the reboot with a few tributes to the original it was worth seeing and chris hemsworh  is hilarious
Jul 19 2016,positive,it wasnt the best movie of all time but it was a fun summer movie i loved all the main actors and despite having some pretty mediocre jokes in it most if not all of which managed to be in the trailer there were a lot of really great laughs kate mckinnon delivers the best and strangest performance of the movie but the three other ladies are also excellent some elements are a bit weak the main villain being one of them but still a fun time
Jul 19 2016,negative,flat movie with a script that struggles to tell the story while interrupted even 5 minutes with a gag or a cameo for me chris hemsworths character is annoying and kate mckinnons jillian holtzmann lacks of substance to make it a believable character melissa mccarthy and a surprising leslie jones are the best in the movie very but very bad editing combined with the  gagcameos  train and the inability to maintain the good start of the movie to develop the story and bring it to a climax that at least worth to be seen that is the recipe for this movie paul feig at his worst
Jul 19 2016,positive,just got home from ghostbusters  oh man that was so good seriously the acting was excellent the plot fantastic it was lovely seeing friendship between four leading actresses who werent just the love interest and it completely works as a standalone if you havent seen the original if you have the nods to the original film are very fun with most of the main original actors in various roles i did have a couple of moments with the ghosts that were surprisingly scary to me  im bad with scary stuff but overall id give the movie an 85910
Jul 19 2016,neutral,who you gonna call not ghodtbusterd
Jul 19 2016,neutral,a couple of my friends went to see it and said that it was better than the reviews suggest  consequently i decided to give it a try   they were wrong
Jul 19 2016,positive,hilarious and scary i loved this film
Jul 19 2016,negative,this movie was horrible dont even waste time watching it on basic cable in 3 months
Jul 19 2016,negative,bad movie sorry but this is the truth
Jul 19 2016,negative,this movie was terrible i dont think i laughed out loud once there were a couple of scenes that made me smile but overall this was a terrible reinvention of the franchise and i cant believe dan akroyd signed on to executive produce this the entire highlight of the movie was having all of the living cast member back except for rick moranis the script was terrible and the comedy was even worse
Jul 19 2016,positive,ive been an avid reader of dystopian novels for many years and i say kudos to the writers of ghostbusters 2016 i cannot recall a single novel or movie that has managed to capture a blatantly misandric society in such a realistic and yet almost satirical way     i am by no means an emotional person but i couldnt hold my tears at the tragedy of the implicit victims of paul feigs movie the hordes of men who had been rendered weak and dimwitted the movie doesnt explain the origins and the purpose of this new kind of men though it leaves many crumbs avid viewers may be able to follow the scientific subtexts hint at a possible genetic modification or a far slower process of natural selection in which the strong and virile males had been eliminated and replaced by their far more servile and slightly imbecilic counterpart a process whose purpose is clearly to produce slave labor for the new alphas fat ugly women many critics would fill pages of vitriolic tirades denouncing the deliberate omission of such a crucial part of the story but i see this as an artistic choice well intune with the movies theme of absolute female dominance     the movie doesnt shy away from exposing the darkest elements of this new frightening society the heroes once represented as men and women endowed with the highest traits of man are now ugly obese and clueless being a repulsive failure is no longer a shameful situation that leads to buying fedoras with my little pony characters and wearing anklelength faux leather trench coats in the summer as petrifying as it may appear failure is now the status quo something to be proud of and no one represents the new failocracy better than our four protagoniststhree in reality with one added for pc purposes these nonbrave uninteresting completely forgettable and eyeroll inducing characters go against the common trends in dystopian stories whose rebel protagonists usually fight with all their might against repressive governments no in this movie the viewers can find no comfort and hope for a better future in fact the story is one big spiral into the abyss as the viewers are constantly traumatized with memories of fat and ugly aunts who abused their christmas trust with kisses reeking of cheap margaritas and cigarettes by playing on cringeinducing memories shared by many a viewer the team of writers carves a terrifying message of doom into these poor moviegoers brains there is no hope to be found in a feminist world
Jul 19 2016,positive,more fun than expected
Jul 19 2016,negative,the only frame of reference in which this movie functions is as a metamovie in which the ghostbusters franchise is treated like a vampire in a hammer horror from the 60s the beloved franchise from our childhood with a stake driven through its heart head chopped off body burned and buried at a crossroads
Jul 19 2016,positive,first thing this movie has super awesome 3d effects that it deserves to be watched in 3d i havent seen anything like this other than 3d theme park rides now onto the pain point the plot and the acting    the movie could have been much funnier given the cast and the directors past movies but it isnt it gets super ridiculously annoying with their scientific mumbo jumbo we get it we already suspended all our logic when we bought tickets to watch this movie you dont need to sell us on how this is supposed to be real science in the original ramis and aykroyd were constantly talking about the science and murray comes in to break the ice and joke about what nerds they are this comedy was put to use at great effect as murray played the main character while ramis and aykroyd are the side characters in this movie wiig and mccarthy played the main characters and they are the nerds that just kept talking about the science we get it stop being wordy somebody break the ice please wiig was especially disappointing cause it doesnt seem like she knows how to act with cgi cues it look like that she staring at a blank space rather than where theres a ghost    leslie jones stole the show here she seems like she actually wanted to be in the movie i want to see a spin off or sequel with just leslie jones let me pitch the plot something strange happened the neighborhood the ghostbusters were called leslie jones is sick so the others left leslie by herself in the firehouse then something really strange happened in the neighborhood leslie cant sleep because the phones were ringing off the hook and found ghost are everywhere all around the firehouse she cant reach the others so she decided to take on the ghosts all by herself    cause seriously i dont need that scientific mumbo jumbo just make it funny
Jul 19 2016,positive,a surprisingly good film i laughed i got scared and i often wanted to cheer i didnt cause in movie theaters you dont make noise a whole lot but all around good movie
Jul 19 2016,positive,genuinely really fun long live ghostbustiers

Jul 19 2016,positive,this movie is hilarious the dynamic between the cast is amazing it had me laughing the whole time 
Jul 19 2016,positive,now you get a car you get a carpatty and oprahprosleslie jonesmelissa mccarthykristen wiigkate mckinnonall of the ghostbustersa very unpopular opinion the cameoschris hemsworth can plays a very good stupid guythe action was fun and funny and entertainingthe horror element it brought to the movieit actually scaryi dont get why they have to take a critical acclaim on movie all the timei dont think this is perfect 5 starsbut its fantasticcan critics have fun in movies like thisbelieve me if you dont just sit back and relax on this movieyoull love it
Jul 19 2016,positive,i thought that while the movie was not as good as number one either way it made me laugh and i genuinely enjoyed it its a great film
Jul 19 2016,positive,a solid movie with a great mix of scares with comedy  its not the original  and it doesnt try to be drags in parts but overall its a big screen experience worth indulging in
Jul 19 2016,positive,hilarious funniest movie i have seen in a long time
Jul 19 2016,positive,hilarious loved the camios and tributes to the original cast to the naysayers get over yourselves funny is funny
Jul 19 2016,negative,it never finds a way of standing on its own there are okay moments but it is mostly unfunny feels unnecessary and worst sexist it could have stood for equality yet it prefers to do what hollywood did for decades an eye for an eye
Jul 19 2016,positive,this movie is very funnny but the beggining was a little boring but once it gets more into the movie it gets into action and comedy also the cgi is very good i reccemond watching this movie if you like tons of comedy but besides that the only thin starage about it is the ghosts it kinda defeats the purpose of the original movie but this movie is stilll very funny and i loved it
Jul 19 2016,positive,a standalone reboot that comes unexpectedly full of laugh and cool action must watch in 3d  45 best summer so far  and the cameo are memorable 
Jul 19 2016,positive,very self aware and funny dude bros are gonna hate but we knew that
Jul 19 2016,negative,a very bad movieits not funnyits stupidbad and sexistthis movie shows men as either stupid or weak or asholesas always the stupid and bad critics of rotten tomatoes are being paid to give positive review to this abomination by calling it fresh with 73while the audience that is the real critics that are not paid to lie voted it with lowergood job bad criticssht on good movies like bvs and praise disgusting movies like ghostbustersage of ultronsharknadoo etc
Jul 19 2016,positive,this movie was so much funnier than i had expected and had laughs throughout the writing was good and the cameos were fun too i have no idea why this movie is getting any bad reviews it must just be the haters   i was a fan of the first movie and skeptical about them recasting anyone but the actressesactors really delivered   in my book this was actually better than the original ghostbusters movie or ghostbusters 2  i would definitely go see it again
Jul 19 2016,positive,awesome entertainment by some hilarious women excited to watch it again and again and again i dont know what all the hating is about
Jul 19 2016,negative,the worst movie of all time the worst movie of all time the worst movie of all time
Jul 19 2016,positive,it was as good as the first if not better
Jul 19 2016,positive,for you to enjoy this you have to already enjoy the type of humour produced by kristen wiig et al did you like bridesmaids great youll love this then is your favourite type of comedy largely movies from the 80s well youre not going to enjoy this then
Jul 19 2016,negative,let me preface this review by stating that i have ibs for anyone that doesnt know what ibs is it stands for irritable bowel syndrome it is a very serious syndrome that causes the bowels to be lets just say extra busy    the new ghostbusters did nothing but cause my ibs to go into full effect full of in my opinion and fact accomplished actors this was a film that took its actors and demolished their acting with a gross misuse of visual effects there is a grand epidemic today of using visual effects way beyond the means of the film putting special effects in the dust in the worst way possible in my opinion the older ghost busters was only so lovable because it let the quirky acting shine along with a good use of special effects    needless to say because of my ibsirritable bowel syndrome and my malcontent with this movie i will not be wearing my favorite slacks anymore    henry
Jul 19 2016,negative,terrible movie i listened to the opinions of the critics and went to see it  total waste of moneyi dont think we saw the same thing
Jul 19 2016,positive,this movie was incredible incredible
Jul 19 2016,positive,this movie is gaining big amounts hatred strangely despite of its success not a big hit though but still a hit
Jul 19 2016,negative,clearly the critics can be bought
Jul 19 2016,positive,im not saying this is the most perfect movie ever made but its damn good and definitely worth praise i understand the urge to compare this iteration to the original  but these are two separate movies made in different times with different levels of social acceptability      for example for better or worse the original showcased white males experiencing supernatural pseudosciencey hijinx they by virtue of being white males required very little by way of character development to be viewed as fully fledged wellrounded characters and as a true product of that era the token diversity did not even arrive until very near the end  just in time to participate in the big boss battle at the end  but not nearly soon enough to do much more by way of character than to be the streetwise black guy    in a modern movie that treatment of characters is not acceptable  and this film is not only aware of that they take it one step forward with the question of reputation and credibility being an underlying thematic element throughout the entire film we are reminded that even in the modern world women and poc are frequently required to jump through extra hoops to be taken seriously by their white  male counterparts     pattis comment i dont know if its a black thing or a woman thing  but im pissed is not merely a comic beat but a resonating reminder that these women both in the movie narrative and also in a selfaware meta level are going to be judged with a hypercritical eye  their femaleness will be marked as a disadvantage from the get go     just as in the movie it is unfair to judge erins tenure prospects based on the clothing she wears rather than her scientific capabilities   it is unfair to judge this ghostbusters reboot based on a rosynostalgic male gaze of the original rather than this movies original content     and just as a reminder to make that judgement call  you actually have to go see this movie not just see a couple trailers and jump to conclusions without having moved from your computer screen
Jul 19 2016,positive,im a huge fan of the originals and i still had a lot of fun with this  i was really skeptical after the trailers but was very pleasantly surprised and will definitely add it into my collection when it comes out  cast was great jokes were funny ghosts were fantastic  didnt quite stand up to the original how could it but definitely feels more inspired than gb2  tons of great fan service moments for older fans but holds its own without feeling like a cheap competitor  almost feels like they were in a pocket dimension where the original gb crew lived but never actually became the ghostbusters
Jul 19 2016,positive,fun and laughs all round thoroughly enjoyed
Jul 19 2016,positive,perhaps not anything earthshattering if released unto itself today this allfemale with one dumb hunk reboot brings modern tech plenty of humor and totally worthy performances to the screen like its predecessors it begs the question why do ghosts only haunt nyc but ill be checking out the next one for sure dont buy into the i havent seen it but i dont like it on principle bs
Jul 19 2016,positive,saw it at an imax 3d and i loved it makes me want to watch the others again dont understand the hate it got
Jul 19 2016,negative,a shameless unfunny agenda driven attempted cash grab that is going to blow up in the face of the social justice movement with a dose of their worst fear  reality  this movie sucks and is going to go down in history as one of the biggest movie financial failures of all time
Jul 19 2016,positive,ghostbusters was far far from perfect doesnt stand up to the original yada yada yada but you know what it was surprisingly good thanks in large part to the strength of its humor it was funny in a much different way from the originals deadpan snarking but it was still damn funny sure its still the fourth best ghostbusters movie but at least that remains a high bar
Jul 19 2016,positive,hilarious  loved the 80s callbacks and the cameos scarier and funnier than i expected
Jul 19 2016,negative,terrible jokes bad writing boring and extremely brainless plot how the hell does this movie have a certified fresh rating
Jul 19 2016,negative,worst crap show excuse of a film ever seriously who let these people touch ghost busters
Jul 19 2016,positive,fun first half with a quartet of female comedians given plenty of room to work out distinct yet complementary comedic styles abetted by a very hilarious and game himbo in chris hemsworth  but once the finale comes around the undeveloped villain overly bombastic visual effects and action and choppy editing revealing plenty of loose ends take over and bring things down quite a bit  game attempt as a reboot and certainly shows up the misogynist nonsense surrounding it but not a strong effort on its own
Jul 19 2016,negative,thank god i got free tickets what an awful movie i had high hopes epic fail
Jul 19 2016,negative,the movie was terrible
Jul 19 2016,positive,dont listen to all those fanboys it was funny enjoyable and had good cameos
Jul 19 2016,positive,its funny how all the low ratings are from dudes ill be the first to say that usually i stay away from all woman comedies this movie is pretty darn good tons of funny lines and sight gags if you pay attention it was better than i thought and a pleasant surprise the only poor choice was leslie jones she just cant act
Jul 19 2016,negative,i had no issues with a female cast or a new ghostbusters movie however these werent ghostbusters didnt laugh out loud once maybe chuckles a few times from kate mckinnon
Jul 19 2016,positive,laugh out loud funny
Jul 19 2016,negative,unfunny unoriginal and a shameless cash in    emails were leaked that also prove that bill murray was forced to cameo and promote the film or hed be sued by sony    please dont see this movie theyll keep rebooting beloved films if you do
Jul 19 2016,neutral,the movie was all right not great  definitely lost points for the trailer which suggested this was set 30 years after the first movie happened and committed a cardinal sin of trailers had content not in the movie  it had a solid cast but some of the characters were more weird or just plain stupid than funny  and working patty in didnt really make sense  she was terrified of a ghost and then suddenly wanted to join the team that ran from it the second time she saw it forumreasons  plot is definitely not the strong point of this movie as it feels more like a really long skit than a polished movie    it had its funny moments and they were plentiful and overall it was enjoyable so long as youre not expecting the original but it was pretty thin on plot a plot which at times seemed shoehorned into the direction they wanted to go whether it really made sense or not  and it loses a full star from me for the terrible job the trailer did representing what i was going to see and especially for having content that was not in the movie  i looked forward to seeing the context of the conversation only to find that exact conversation never happened which irritates me    overall i would recommend seeing it but with low expectations  that way youll be pleasantly surprised
Jul 19 2016,positive,one of the best movies of the year would definitely love to see again in theaters
Jul 19 2016,neutral,expected this to be a real looser but was pleasantly surprised chris helmsworth should stick to thor not his fault but not sure what his character was even there for graphics were of course much better than the original but there has been 30 years to improve wonderful to see the cameo appearances of original stars worth seeing or renting
Jul 19 2016,positive,i went to see this with my wife and kids and we all loved it i walked in the theater dragging my feet and wanting to hate it but i quickly forgot about trying to hate it now i dont think it is as good as the original but my kids might one day hold this movie to as high of a regard as i do the original the trailers did not do this movie justice all of the jokes in the trailers seemed awkward and stiff but they landed perfectly in the film kate mckinnon and chris hemsworth knocked it out of the park with their characters
Jul 19 2016,negative,this movie was disappointing the over the top humor that felt very forced to over use of cgi really brought this movie down the pacing in this movie was terrible and some of the scenes were unnecessary
Jul 19 2016,negative,just wait for it to hit dvd and rent it or maybe skip it all together better yet rent the first one and enjoy i was bored much of the time during this halfhearted remake
Jul 19 2016,positive,it was a fun flick and a decent upgrade of the original i was initially turned off by the trailers but took my daughter to see it opening day in 3d the 3d is amazing and the humor is good i was worried that there would be a more feminist angle to the movie but outside of one or two throwaway lines i didnt see an agenda in the film it was fun and funny i am glad i took a chance on it the original will always be superior but this is a good modern take on the classic
Jul 19 2016,negative,awful stereotype jokes horrible improv and no suspense or horror
Jul 19 2016,positive,i dont think this movie is as good as the originals if you go into this movie with an open mind and dont base it on the original the movie is great and has great potential to become a series has several great easter eggs throughout the movie
Jul 19 2016,negative,a absolute disgrace not funny at all and only one person in the movie could act
Jul 19 2016,positive,good not great but honestly some people are just hating for the sake of hearing there own voices
Jul 19 2016,negative,a watered down unfunny remake with little to no respect for the original source material give this one a miss
Jul 19 2016,positive,this movie was awesome i love the whole cast it was refreshing to see a remake thats different to have woman instead  when you touch a classic you have to be overly creative so you dont mess it up and it was done great  i was laughing and jumping around the whole time
Jul 19 2016,positive,saw this in 3d and surround sound which added to the fun  this was a great summer movie to watch  its hard to redo ghostbusters but the story line and script was terrific  these ladies were hysterical and i thought it was surprisingly funny
Jul 19 2016,negative,its such a wasted effort that i feel i shouldnt waste much effort in reviewing it as i was watching it in the theater i remember experiencing this feeling of wait a minute i saw this before multiple times if the studio didnt want to bother setting this film apart from what came before it then why did they bother its fine to have some shoutouts to the classics but not the way they did it here the cameos werequestionable at best mired by the fact that harold ramis died a few years ago and thus he couldnt make a cameo as well     oh and the ghosts are lame theyre either in bright green for the most part or in bright blue and they have nothing on what stan winston and the other fx geniuses behind the original movies conceived of slimer returns but its just par for the course    the leads arent poor actresses because just like the original cast they are all from snl or at least were alumni in some cases they acted as well as youd expect but it was the script that didnt help kristen wiig didnt have any good lines or delivery mccarthy unfortunately couldnt even come close to dan aykroyds performance and while theres nothing necessarily wrong with the other two leads they certainly couldnt save this movie from its unenviable status as a meh fest chris hemsworths character might rile a few chuckles but his characters goofy stupidity gets a bit overbearing the villain is sleep inducing but ill hand them this at least he was not recycled from previous entries in the franchise heres looking at you official videogame    the theme song they came up with for the movie was one of the worst aspects of the film    the prerelease marketing was a disaster due to weak responses to weak naysayers who should have been ignored as they deserved but instead feig in particular declared that it was all due to the cast being allfemale i could personally care less if the cast were all male or all female its all about the chemistry between them but instead he gave the critics more ammunition to use against the movie on the bright side at least the ghostbusters themselves werent reimagined as highlyattractive fishoutofwater type bimbos who happened to wield experimental weaponry that can incapacitate ghosts and whatnot    the special effects did not save this movie none of the ghosts were even remotely intriguing in design and they were more like neon signs than what they were meant to be     the jokes kind of fell flat but there was the odd moment where the comedy worked i thought that leslie jones character would be the most obnoxious but shes quite the opposite actually because her character somehow goes through the most changes    i put too much effort into this movie with this review
Jul 19 2016,positive,i actually liked this more than i thought i try to stay open minded when i watch the amount of movies that i have but i think the bad press jaded me going in i enjoyed the cast and humor and seeing the originals make cameos
Jul 19 2016,neutral,some funny parts but lacked the suspense of the original and a lot of it was contrived  on screen chemistry between the movies star cast helped but in the end i found myself rolling my eyes more often than i actually enjoyed the film
Jul 19 2016,positive,i really liked this movie not as funny as i expected but still a must see
Jul 19 2016,negative,this is one of the worst pieces of garbage produced in the past decade  i want my money back
Jul 19 2016,negative,i gave this movie a chance because i love the original ghostbusters  i actually believe sharknado 3 was a better movie than this  the sad thing the movie is supposed to be a comedy and yet i didnt laugh the whole movie
Jul 19 2016,positive,this movie was hilarious great reboot of a classic
Jul 19 2016,negative,nonfunny manhating sexist and racist hope none of them ever work again
Jul 19 2016,positive,funny movie for all the mens rights groups who hated the fact that a female led ghostbusters reboot was being made deal with it coz this aint a mens world anymore us kickass women aint going away loved this movie the ladies aced it and they made me laugh my ass off
Jul 19 2016,negative,absolute destruction of my childhood  really not even funny    its was like a long failed saturday night live skit where its funny to the cast but nobody else
Jul 19 2016,positive,really funny movie kate mckinnon was hilarious
Jul 19 2016,positive,fantastic loved every minute of it it was funny didnt take itself too seriously but was totally coherent there was not one thing i had an issue with will go see again
Jul 19 2016,negative,they kill bill murray and make jokes about men wasnt exactly funny
Jul 19 2016,negative,some skilled actresses but no story that we have not seen before  once again hollywood just tries to cash in on old stories  special effects look so cgi they might as well have used clay  stop motion  enjoy the old one and forget this trash
Jul 19 2016,positive,unapologetically funny sweet and just an all round good time was nice to see 4 women actually allowed to be funny in their own right would totally recommend for a bit of light hearted fun
Jul 19 2016,negative,not funny at all clearly overrated movie
Jul 19 2016,negative,this was a terrible movie that slapped the magic and originality of the original ghostbusters in the face the comedy was terrible with perhaps a chuckle or two terrible cgi and attempts at hidden sexism thats insulting at terrible levels terrible and shameful attempt at a cash grab
Jul 19 2016,positive,it was clever and well done trailers didnt portray it well
Jul 19 2016,positive,great film so funny and you know what its gets five stars off my kids and their friends too because  most of them dont know the original  so dont show your age by constantly referring to it girl power  lol
Jul 19 2016,negative,saw the new ghostbusters with my girlfriend today i think we were both a bit disappointed by it and would pretty much recommend anyone wait to see it on tv if at all my initial thoughts from the trailers were that it looked like a crass reboot of the original and despite some promising reviews my instinct proved correct much of the humour was surprisingly puerile and sexist  if the movie was remade with 4 men and a pretty dumb blonde secretary there would rightfully be an uproar about its crassness  kate mckinnon was a pleasant surprise though
Jul 19 2016,positive,what a pleasant surprise this film was when i saw it last saturday i thought the four actresses playing the ghostbusters outstanding and chris helmsworth sent himself up rotten the story was pacey and the effects brilliant     the only drawback i thought was the villain who was lame this stopped my giving this film 5 stars
Jul 19 2016,negative,horrible script with nothing remotely funny  paul is to blame for this huge turd i feel embarrassed for the actresses
Jul 19 2016,positive,the most fun ive had at the movies in years
Jul 19 2016,positive,loved it going to see it again it was so good laugh out loud funny the cameos and easter eggs are awesome the ladies gave it their all truly a fun hilarious summer movie
Jul 19 2016,negative,total shit waste of moneyonly girls would like this tbh
Jul 19 2016,positive,best ghostbusters ever
Jul 19 2016,neutral,this movie will entertain you but its nothing special
Jul 19 2016,positive,i thought this movie was fantastic i loved the nod to the original
Jul 19 2016,positive,paul feig never ceases to amaze me this is a brilliant remake my face still hurts from laughing so much soooo frickin good
Jul 19 2016,positive,not the best not the worst  i was a huge fan of the original ghostbusters and it would be impossible to recapture the magic of the first one  however i will say that the 40ish minutes they spent meandering around the plot with the cringeworthy logo discussion when they were hiring the assistant and the whole we are the whoever people not the ghostbusters thing was the worst part  if they removed the 40 minutes where they tried to not become the ghostbusters theyd have had a much better movie  once they identified themselves and got their vehicle the movie took off  it seemed to me that the biggest enemy this movie had outside the naysayers was the writers   i think they need a sequel to properly present themselves  their onscreen chemistry is amazing
Jul 19 2016,positive,fun fresh great story perfect pairing on actors the end
Jul 19 2016,negative,lets sum up this movie with one word         when i wasnt cringing at the lame jokes rolling my eyes at this movies contempt for the audience and men as a whole and desperately wishing for more kate mckinnon and chris hemsworth i was facepalming at how unashamedly pandering the entire film was     this movie wont emerge from the originals shadow in its own right because it tries way too goddamned hard to be in the originals shadow
Jul 19 2016,negative,very boring and forgettable
Jul 18 2016,negative,ive seen michael bay films better than this
Jul 18 2016,negative,its wholly unremarkable and totally forgettable  chris hemsworth is pretty much the only funny thing in the movie    the original ghostbusters was made like a legitimate horror movie that happened to have funny characters who were just trying to do their job  this one is made like a cartoon full of derpy wannabe superheroes its absolutely full of unfunny jokes     everyone is trying waaaay too hard to be funny and failing and mckinnonholtzmann is trying like 1000 too hard to be wacky and quirky and just coming off as mildly annoying  even hemsworths jokes only work because apparently he has amazing comedic timing and delivery    the original had ghosts and monsters that genuinely were kinda freaky and for the most part the effects still look great today  the reboot is full of gaudy cartoonish neon ghosts that are poorly done    its a caricature of a caricature of a caricature of the original ghostbusters as seen through the lens of multiple versions aiming to make the franchise more and more kidfriendly the lens of ghostbusters 2 and then the real ghostbusters cartoon and now this    the villain sucks and his plot is weak    this took the place of a ghostbusters 3 written by max landis and directed by ivan reitman the idea that were never going to see that movie and that we got this one instead what a waste    its not a terrible movie  its just not a good one either  its a waste of time  wasted potential
Jul 18 2016,positive,a mediocre action movie that is a decent reimagining of the ghostbuster story i have never had any problem having the cast be all female or the idea of a remake my problem with the idea of the film and my reaction after seeing the film is the same i dont think jenny mccarthy is funny and this movie doesnt dissuade me i hope the supporting cast would help overcome this but it didnt i barely laughed at all in this movie just staring at it i wasnt numb i just didnt see any of it as funny my strongest laugh in the whole film is a scene where chris hemsworth is eating a sandwich mccarthy throws the sandwich away and someone tosses the sandwich back to hemsworth even that only got a single ha out of me the effects are good the story is decent and its not a bad reimagining i just would have liked some comedy in my comedy
Jul 18 2016,positive,leave your upset inner child or serious hypercritical movie goer self at the door this film is two hours of lighthearted jokes impressive vfx and memorable badassery
Jul 18 2016,positive,very entertaining popcorn flick
Jul 18 2016,negative,remember when movies like this took themselves a little bit seriously i miss that 
Jul 18 2016,negative,disappointing the original was much better i gave it 2 stars because i like the 3d effects it just wasnt that funny the characters lacked any kind of real depth it was a waste of talent for the comedians
Jul 18 2016,neutral,this is just horrible
Jul 18 2016,positive,hilarious and cute i loved the way the original busters were incorporated and the revamp of the theme
Jul 18 2016,positive,ghostbusters 2016 full review  july 18 2016 by stephen alexander       who you gonna call some people might hesitate according to the recent fan reactions to the remake of the classic franchise ghostbusters so why are fan so upset with the 2016 reboot        the internet buzz had been booming with hype about the remake that was once thought to be a sequel lifetime fans of the franchise practically lived on the edge of their seats for years before the official announcement was made that the franchise was about to resurface in fact dan ackroyd harold ramis and original director ivan reitman had been working on a script for the better part of a decade a script intended to be a direct sequel so why didnt the ghostbusters 3 script ever see the light of day unfortunately the script apparently relied heavily on the character we all know and love as dr peter vekman but bill murrayvekman simply wasnt ready to participate according to murray the script simply wasnt good enough and he refused to be involved in a script that would hurt his acting career an honorable argument considering he had been interviewed several times stating if the boys bring me a decent script then perhaps i would consider making a sequel i just dont think anyone wants to see a group of old men fighting ghosts in new york city he also voiced his dislike of the 1989 sequel ghostbusters 2 so how do you make a ghostbusters movie without drvekman you simply dont        another script surfaced some time later as dan ackroyd suddenly seemed pumped and ready to go unfortunately the unexpected passing of harold ramisegon spengler in 2014 seemed to throw a permanent wrench into the system not only did they lack drpeter vekman but now dregon spengler as well it was at this time that the franchise was destined for a complete reboot rather than a sequel tease after tease ghostbusters fans journeyed along with it on a heartfelt roller coaster of anticipation and disappointment       when the franchise was picked up by sony pictures there was finally hope for another ghostbusters film but with the recent disappointments of the transformers gijoe and teenage mutant ninja turtles movies the future of this beloved franchise seemed grim       when the script for the remake was finally complete it was officially announced that the cast of the ghostbusters team was to be entirely female a bold move made by newly appointed director paul feig that obviously wasnt entirely thought through in this writers opinion considering that the target audience during the 80s and 90s was strictly young boys it shouldnt have surprised feig when the fans lashed out in anger the young boys that owned the toys read the comic books watched the cartoons and could recite the films like scripture are now fully grown men and realistically make up the majority of audience members film critics and franchise customers these are the fans that are responsible for the success of the franchise and should have been taken into consideration before making such a bold move to cast an entirely female team       unfortunately sonys agenda had been relatively clear before the franchise was ever even purchased considering that sony pictures had gone on record for funding hilary clintons presidential campaign it was clear that the extreme feminist movement had sunken its claws into what had always been considered a maletargeted franchise the motive whether or not it was clear to the cast or crew was to immortalize the strong badass female persona and belittle men as much as possible an agenda that is quite clear when watching the 2016 reboot of ghostbusters men are portrayed to be weak intellectually inferior or socially pathetic as opposed to the brilliant and charismatic females it wasnt difficult to see that there was a silent gender war taking place behind the scenes a bad move for anyone that understands economics in movie franchises        chris hemswoths character kevin beckman plays the stupified extremely dumbed down version of annie potts original character janine the ghostbusters secretary though his lack of intelligence was certainly good for a few laughs it was upsetting just how stupid he truly was a move that wouldnt have gone over well if annie potts had delivered the same type of performance    movie review     the film begins with a chilling tale of murderous intrigue during a tour of a haunted museum i personally found this particular scene somewhat entertaining as it portrayed the familiar creepy vibe from the original film the scene concludes with a somewhat drawn out venture into the basement of the building misleading the audience to believe that it was somehow significant to the over all plot which it simply wasnt the iconic ghostbusters theme begins and every fan is on the edge of their seats i was personally pleased that the director began the movie in the same iconic fashion as the original films       the story continues with kristen wiigs character erin gilbert whos integrity as a professor seeking legitimacy is immediately diminished as she is caught dancing like a fool before an empty lecture hall though many fans have seen this as a character flaw i found it important to the over all plot that professor gilbert simply wasnt destined to remain in her current position though i found her antics relatively unfunny it was not far off from dr peter vekmans attitude when it came to his image       a recently advertised book cowritten by both erin gilbert and abbey yatesmelissa mccarthy threatens to ruin her reputation as a scientist this addition to the plot i found rather intriguing and somewhat accurate as it is no secret that anyone that studies the paranormal is immediately dismissed throughout the scientific world regardless of the overwhelming evidence pertaining to the existence of the afterlife the film also points out the very real frustrations of legitimate paranormal researchers when it comes to staged or false investigations       as the ladies first set the vibe for the ghostbusters team a less than tasteful joke opens the scene not just any joke but a queefvaginal fart joke this i found embarrassing and uncalled for despite the female cast in fact i feel rather sickened just by writing about it a fart joke wouldnt have gone over well if the cast was male i simply cannot picture egon or ray making such a distasteful joke during a serious investigation into the world of the paranormal i personally feel that this severely damaged the character development of the over all team and made it difficult for the audience to take them seriously as ghostbusters this seemed like yet another controversial ploy to establish feminist humor in a male dominated audience it was though the director wanted the men to get up and leave like the film was created strictly for females         later we meet patty tolan leslie jones a character designed to mimic winston zedmoreernie hudson the token black ghostbuster that fans around the world have come to love though winston wasnt exactly a scientist he added charisma and an important realist perspective to the team patty tolan on the other hand didnt seem to add much she seemed over dramatic and overthetop an uncomfortable and uncalledfor stereotypical black woman i was personally appalled that the franchise would push the feminist agenda so fiercely yet seemed to drop the ball on the black stereotype i would have liked to see a more intellectual version of winston zedmore rather than this overthetop stereotype ernie hudson never relied on racial stereotypes to get laughs from the audience but pure charisma we have the tools we have the talent its miller time         as the ghostbusters gradually come together we come to know jillian holtzmannkate mckinnon or the egon spengler of the reboot the opening distasteful joke aside holtzmann is a character that i found the most appealing as the movie progressed i found myself gradually liking her more and more she clearly represents a stranger quirkier and generally funnier version of harold ramis dr egon spengler though i must admit that it took some time and an open mind to truly appreciate jillian holtzmann       the worst addition to the ghostbusters team seemed to be abby yates melissa mccarthy though her character was essential to the plot and she did deliver on some of the humor mccarthy seemed to play the exact same role she always does so much in fact that at times it seemed to be a melissa mccarthy movie much like the teenage mutant ninja turtles was a megan fox movie though i have nothing against melissa mccarthy she simply didnt belong on a team of paranormal investigators her type of humor and general presence seemed to hold the movie back more than anything       no plot is complete without a decent villain rather than gozer the gozarian or vigo the carpathian we have social reject and pathetic excuse for a man rowen northneil casey yet another move diminishing the masculinity of the franchise despite caseys acting i found the character to be more menacing than threatening rowan is clearly no gozer or vigo the only upside to rowans character is that he was able to shape shift taking on the iconic persona of the ghost in the ghostbusters logo something that fans had been desperate to see on the big screen since the real ghostbusters cartoon back in the day unfortunately the only way to take down the big bad ghost was for the female ghostbusters to aim their proton packs at his groin further establishing female dominant ideals on the male audience       on the upside fans got to see some fantastic cameos including bill murray ernie hudson dan ackroyd sigourney weaver and annie potts unfortunately rick moranis who has all but vanished from the movie scene since his voice roll in disneys brother bear back in 2006 stayed clear of the reboot fans also got to see the original firehouse the stay puft marshmallow man and of course everyones favorite freeroaming vapor or repeating phantasm slimer much to fans dismay a pointless female version of the beloved ghost was added into the mix though he had one humorous scene where he steals ecto1 the severely dulled version of the original cadillac ambulance his screen presence was very brief there was no indication that he will return for a sequel hopefully if he does return slimer will leave his female counterpart in the neither world and away from the film footage       regardless of its many flaws the film does however deliver as a ghostbusters movie this lifetime fan was expecting a proverbial sht sandwich but walked out of the theater smiling from ear to ear despite its obvious feminist agenda the movie delivered on several levels though many critics have bashed the film based on many attributes i must wholeheartedly disagree on a handful of the complaints allow me to address the obvious    the cgi was indeed a bit overthetop when it came to the neon tinge of the average ghost many critics have complained that the specters seem straight out of the haunted mansion a disney movie starring eddie murphy targeted for a childrens audience the complaints that the ghosts looked cheesy is laughable as the original films portrayal of the dead has always been cheesy its a ghostbusters movie not paranormal activity   the classification of the original film the original production of ghostbusters was indeed classified as a comedy but disgruntled fanboys fail to remember the spooky or sometimes frightening aspects of the film the only reason the film was classified as a comedy was due to its cast a predominately snl cast even though there were very few comedic scenes anything that was humorous about the original film was due to the natural charisma of the cast nothing that could be properly written into a script in reality the 2016 reboot had considerably more laughs        so is this new installment to the ghostbusters franchise better than the original i dont believe so but it may measure up to the sequel is it a bad movie not really it has some bad plot lines and certainly bad casting but over all i would say that its worth the price of admission on the big screen i know this fan in particular will be lining up for the sequel on the other hand i do have some advice for paul feig if he decides to take on the second installment   1 lose melissa mccarthy or develop her character in a less cartoonish way that doesnt mimic her past films i would suggest replacing her altogether with a male ghostbuster equilibrium is important and the american presidential election will be long over by then so there will be less pressure from sony  2 bring us a decent bad guy personally speaking i dont think gozer is quite ready for a comeback yet i would build up to gozers destruction of the city over several movies i personally think that the boogeyman or halloween would be incredible to see on the big screen  3 work on the tech fans are going to want to see a more familiar version of the pke meter as well as the trap now that the first ecto1 has been destroyed maybe bring back the original cadillac perhaps holtzmann has a flare for classic cars work with you fans mrfeig  4 lose the feminist agenda i think i can speak for the rest of the fans when i say that we can agree on gender neutrality rather than female dominance a female ghostbuster was never a problem but a full reversal of the genders seems like you dont know your target audience in the slightest
Jul 18 2016,positive,if you go in comparing it to the original it will fall short and you will not like it if you go in expecting a generally funny popculture flick you will enjoy it
Jul 18 2016,negative,if i had never seen ghostbusters 1984 i would have thought this movie was merely terrible  being a fan of the original renders this movie an abomination    i give it 2 stars because i did laugh a couple of times and thought that leslie jones and kate mckinnon did a good job  i was especially pleased with jones because she can be real spotty on snl    unfortunately melissa mccarthy and kristin wiig are flat and completely lacking humor      i suppose one thing that makes this movie worth seeing if you want to be in the mood to see ghostbusters 1984 watch this  it will immediately have you craving for the palate cleanser of a wellcrafted version
Jul 18 2016,positive,i usually dont like reboots because id rather see a story with new original characters this movie while it is a reboot of the franchise and follows a very similar story as the original does not reboot the same characters there are certain aspects of the new characters that are reminiscent of the original characters but i was not able to watch the movie and say that one is ray that one is egon etc they are new characters and the relationships between them are new as well
Jul 18 2016,positive,the best film ive seen all year from reading critic reviews i think men see it differently to women  i saw a film i wanted to take my daughters to  a film where theres a variety of female characters who are developed interesting and funny played by a cast chosen for their comedic skills not how hot they are the fact that the villian was played by the kind of white male troll who lives in his basement thats been trashing this film made is 1000 better the script was hilarious and the plot  while cliche  was what you expect from a ghosbusters film it was leaps and bounds better than the original i would recommend this film to all feminists  and all wlw holtzmann i swear  and anyone who wants to be educated about what a genuinely inclusive hollywood film looks like
Jul 18 2016,positive,loved it tons of jokes and lots of references to the original ladies of the 80s it is a must see
Jul 18 2016,positive,love this movie it was super funny and the cgi on the ghosts was great 
Jul 18 2016,negative,im sorry it was so bad it would have been really cool to have a new ghostbusters movie that was worth the wait its bland at best and its very forgettable it had a few laughs here and there but not worth the price of admission its worth a rental on a rainy day i guess
Jul 18 2016,negative,so so disappointing dont waste your time or money dialogue dragged unnecessary scenes pointless distractions such a shame sigh
Jul 18 2016,negative,wonderful actresses reduced to rubble in this horrible written uninspired train wreck
Jul 18 2016,positive,yes yes yes   more gender swapping movies girl everithing i feel amazing after coming out of the theater it was an amazing feeling swing a group of women representing and taking over loved it   give it a freaking chance
Jul 18 2016,negative,boring and cringe worthy at every turn i thought kate mckinnon was going to be the best part but she was the worst her character was all mugging and no personality next worst was chris hemsworths too dumb to live character  the rest were just bad and unfunny except for leslie jones who when she wasnt screaming was the only one that felt like an actual character and was the only one to get a couple of chuckles out of me this movie wasnt worth the controversy and isnt worth your time
Jul 18 2016,positive,a lot of the men who hate this movie just arent used to having their only representation in popular movies be eye candy so dont listen to them  this movie was definitely made for people with an open mind if you go in with low expectations youre gonna hate it but if you go in with high expectations youre gonna be disappointed it was good but not perfect there were very many funny moment and the cast blended nicely but there isnt much of a story things just kind of happen so if you like movies that make perfect sense sorry the writers probably werent paying much attention to the facts of their universe when they wrote this movie but id say the special effects were pretty cool not realistic or perfect but there is this one scene with kate mckinnon that i almost cried during because it was perfect  so basically girls go see this movie youre gonna love it but if your dadbrotherboyfriendfriend is kind of stubborn and doesnt like change dont take them to see this movie  i will see this movie again
Jul 18 2016,positive,paul feig is the best
Jul 18 2016,negative,this trash gave me brain cancer
Jul 18 2016,positive,when this film was first announced it attracted significant controversy most of the controversy coming from fans of the 1984 original primarily male fans they were infuriated that the reboot would feature female women in the leads hunting ghosts almost as if women couldnt even hunt ghosts like men could a point that is brought up at one point in the film between wiig and mccarthy in a scene that pokes fun at the hatred that surrounded the film from male fans after the first trailer was released it quickly became the most disliked trailer in youtube history as if fans were trying to get it thrown away into oblivion fans would even go onto the internet or social media and voice their thoughts in unprofessional misogynistic manners which got a lot focus centered around the film with many wondering if the film would turn out to be good and throw away the controversy surrounding it on the other hand while i was skeptical of this film i was approaching from a more professional manner i was unsure of the idea of rebooting a popular and wellmade film and if it was a good idea while i was also hoping that the four women wouldnt be carbon copies of the original four male characters from the 1984 film from the trailers i was also unsure of the film and wasnt intrigued from what i saw dont get me wrong i liked the idea of bringing in four strong female characters and having this sense that the proverbial torch was being passed down by the original four to a new group i just was unsure if rebooting a classic was good after seeing the film which i chose to see mainly because i was interested in how it would be handled and told i have to say that i was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed the film even if i still had a mixed response to it overall    the film focuses on erin gilbert a scientist who is up for tenure after realizing that a book on the paranormal that she cowrote with abby yates has resurfaced she reluctantly agrees to aid yates and eccentric engineer jillian holtzmann in investigating a paranormal event at a mansion so that the book can disappear while they find a ghost they are fired from their respective positions and choose instead to open their own business on investigating ghostly occurrences hiring a hunky dimwitted secretary after mta worker patty tolan encounters a sighting in the subway she joins the team and after the four manage to capture a ghost at a rock concert they gain fame while also trying to contend with a dangerous ghostly threat and trouble from the mayors office    the cast especially the four main women do their best in the film even when things get a little sloppy melissa mccarthy as abby yates once again shows off her over the top comedic style at times offering a wild performance and other times restrained though it mostly focuses on a wild approach there is a funny scene where she berates a chinese delivery man on the amount of food he delivered but he once when it is used more than once he gets to feel overused and a little stale kristen wiig as erin gilbert does a fine job depicting the character at times as ambitious and other times as a skeptic while the character does at times feel like the antibill murray antipeter venkman she brings a different comedic feel to her character than murray brought to venkman there are humorous scenes where wiig oggles over the hunky dimwitted secretary while another scene where she attempts to warn the mayor and hangs on a table screaming just feels forced almost bland wiig and mccarthy still seem to enjoy the scenes they have together though kate mckinnon as jillian holtzmann is fantastic stealing almost every scene shes in mckinnon feels like a cross between bill murray dan aykroyd and harold ramis becoming the films breakout star while mckinnon is over the top she is loads of fun to watch throughout the entire film acting as the teams gadget master almost like their q creating the various gadgets for the team to use against malevolent ghosts leslie jones as mta worker patty tolan delivers a mixed feel of the four women the outsider like ernie hudson in the 1984 original she joins the team after witnessing a ghostly sighting while jones is hilarious in scenes i had a real problem with the character since it seemed to be going back to old worn out stereotype feeling almost like a minstrel show throughout the film the character is either screaming getting scared of a room or else a few times freaking out there is a nice scene during a rock concert where she attempts to leave while a dragon ghost is perched a top her shoulders which is really funny while her line i guess hes going to queens hes going to be the third scariest thing on that train is funny still i couldnt help but feel there could have been more with the character instead of falling into unwanted stereotype i dont know if its the problem of the director or the script but it doesnt work hopefully though if a sequel does occur jones will have more to do and wont fall into that old stereotype feel and approach the four women work nicely together though showing great chemistry and proving that they had tones of fun making this film neil casey as rowan north does a fine job despite his villainous character not making a lot of sense at times at times the character seems to wander in though its still fun to watch casey work though he could have still be developed a little bit better there is still a great scene involving him where he turns into a giant ghost which while feeling over the top is done well chris hemsworth like mckinnon also steals the film as hunky dimwitted secretary kevin hemsworth proves that he can tackle different roles with this role being very different from thor hemsworth is brilliant working well along the female characters hemsworth manages to bring different elements to his character especially after he is possessed by a ghost bring an even funnier take on the character there is a great scene between hemsworth and mccarthy where mccarthy asks him if the coffee has sugar and after hemsworth takes a sip he spits out stating he hates coffee hemsworth and mckinnon are let alone the price of ticket wonderfully managing to steal the film whenever they are present cecily strong makes a humorous appearance as the mayors assistant charles dance makes an interesting cameo as the dean of columbia university while andy garcia is brilliant as the mayor as well as matt walsh and michael kenneth williams as homeland security agents viewers should also watch out for five cameos bill murray dan aykroyd ernie hudson sigourney weaver and annie potts these actors made appearances in the original film and make interesting cameos in this film while it wouldve been interesting to see them reprise their roles from the original it probably would have been distracting so having them appear as different characters works better after bill murray appears as a skeptic debunking the four women its almost like a game looking for the next four aykroyds apart from murray is the funniest making references toward his character from the original it could almost be interesting if his character from the original ray stantz is actually the cabdriver though that may be a little ludicrous    paul feig who directed and cowrote the film with katie dippold does a fine job at honoring the 1984 original which had been directed by ivan reitman and written by dan aykroyd and harold ramis even if he does fail in spots the film is not a direct recreation of the original but instead has a different approach in spots even if there are similarities the film starts off with an amazing scene at a mansion whereas in the original it was at the new york public library while in the original murray aykroyd and ramis worked at columbia university only wiig works at columbia in this film jones and hudson both join the team off the street though in different ways both films have the team becoming wellknown and famous at a larger location a hotel in the original and a rock concert in this film both films also have different major threats as well while also having to deal with the mayor still this film has a great approach to its originality while also poking fun in spots at the hatred that came from male fans of the 1984 film while this film takes place in new york city most scenes were shot in boston though it manages to appear as new york city feig and dippol craft an interesting film that feels like a homage toward the original this film is feigs first pg13 rated comedy since bridesmaids the heat and spy all three of which were rated r while feig probably had difficult making a pg13 rated comedy since he must have had so much use to making an r rated comedy he still pulls off a good pg13 rated film robert yeomans cinematography is snazzy in spots while also wonderfully supporting the main plot blending horror with comedy in other spots the final fight between the ghostbusters and ghosts is photographed and shot brilliantly not only supporting that chaotic feel but also blending the feel of a comic book battle with horror and comedy theodore shapiros score also wonderfully supports the film feeling jazzy in spots and really subtle the decision of bringing in ray parker jrs original theme song from the 1984 film is genius in many ways the special effects chiefly the ghosts are wellhandled the ghosts are spectacular while the filmmakers choosing the smart move of introducing new and original ghosts a female ghost in a mansion who pukes up green slime an electrocuting ghost a dragonlike ghost at a rock concert balloons pilgrims and a flashing ghost the cameos of slimer and staypuft marshmallow man are really brilliant as well as the ghost that the villain takes the form of while some may complain that the film relies on too much cgi for the ghosts it doesnt feel over the top and has a very unique feel to it while still emitting the oldfashioned tone that was present in the ghosts in the 1984 film for me it never ruined the film    still there are few problems that resulted in my mixed response a few of which i have already mentioned joness stereotype character and the underdeveloped villain the main problem is that the film follows wild comedy unlike the original which was more subtle while bridesmaids had wild comedy for example the bridal shop scene it supported the film while i feel a subtle approach should have been brought to this film like with the original if the film had been on the subtle side it probably would have been more interesting and lots more fun some of the comedy at times seems to be overdone and go on for too long as well almost reaching the point of sitcom in a few spots while the film does start off great it sags for a while but around the middle it moves along with a riproaring finale between the ghostbusters and the ghosts    the end result is a good film but not a great one while it pays tribute to the original in a good way there are still issues though its a film that you will enjoy seeing which wont waste your time and is still worth the price of ticket or even a late night netflix viewing if a sequel is made which no doubt there will be one maybe it will be done a little bit better and with more heart though thats not to say this film didnt have heart it just felt a little empty in spots while the sequel will follow a subtler feel the end result though is enjoyable and i should also say that noone should pay any attention to the naysayers or fanboys the ladies do rule this film even seeing the film being dedicated to harold ramis is respectful and made me pleased im sure that ramis would have approached of this film    still around during the end credits and for an interesting scene after the credits that makes mention to an important character from the original film though i will not spoil it for you
Jul 18 2016,positive,they kept the quirky feel of the original with lots of throwbacks could have been slicker but would it have been a ghostbusters movie then
Jul 18 2016,negative,a forced remake of a comedy classic
Jul 18 2016,positive,pretty mediocre few things stood out to be pretty good but overall a meh film
Jul 18 2016,negative,the worst thing that ever happened to the name ghost busters
Jul 18 2016,negative,i dont disagree with feminism i just disagree with crappy remakes of great movies
Jul 18 2016,positive,while the two stars seemed to just miss on some of the humor the supporting trio of kate mckinnon leslie jones and chris hemsworth make the movie    it is not a classic but i enjoyed it
Jul 18 2016,positive,i thought it was funny got a bit stale at one point but picked up towards the end most of the negative reviews seem to be from whiny 80s babies who think that everything back in the 80s and 90s was so much better than anything nowadays
Jul 18 2016,negative,a dazzlingly predictable and bland excuse for a film  riddled with lackluster banter that is anything but witty and saved only by its somewhat less than tactfully done cameos and feminist overtones thus the egregiously generous 73 rating theres nothing film critics love more than throwbacks and feminism
Jul 18 2016,positive,hilarious i loved kate mckinnon as holtzmann
Jul 18 2016,positive,im a huge fan of the original movie and i really enjoyed this version
Jul 18 2016,negative,the girls were brilliant but that is all  bland writing and poor special effects were  paul feig fails again
Jul 18 2016,negative,this was an absolute catastrophe  such disrespect for the original  unless you are a young girl so desperate for some kind of female role model that was horribly and embarrassingly portrayed this movie isnt for you  this is slap in the face to the ghostbuster community
Jul 18 2016,negative,wacky scenes and dry humor is not idea of comedy
Jul 18 2016,positive,not as good as the originals but if you look at this as a completely different movie then its pretty good hemsworths character is too over the top being dumb that its not even comical at some points i will definitely go see a second one though if its made everyone makes a cameo except rick m and i feel that is a shame it almost belittles what he did on the original shows to not care enough to pay his respects when all the other cast members did that was very disappointing
Jul 18 2016,negative,this was awfulno plot  melissa mccarthy is the only reason to watch
Jul 18 2016,negative,this movie is just straight up trash dont watch it its just another feminazi sjw bullshit movie and you see that all thru out it
Jul 18 2016,positive,gender roles are completely reversed  women are interested in fringe science and engineering male assistant is pretty and dumb  one of the few mainstream movies that does the traditional gender roles swapped or shows smart women at all  passes the bechdel test with flying colors
Jul 18 2016,negative,starts off with a queef joke and continues under performing from there
Jul 18 2016,negative,worst movie ive seen in years not one redeeming part of this waste of time
Jul 18 2016,positive,this movie is pretty funny and better than most are giving it credit for its not out to steal the originals glory it stands on its own and does a good job at that
Jul 18 2016,negative,what a waste of good cgi and talent few laughs and a script that is doa it wasnt bad because of the cast just a bad idea that was poorly executed
Jul 18 2016,negative,interesting how the average rating is 65 audience gave it 57 and somehow its at 73 certified fresh dafuq
Jul 18 2016,positive,i personally enjoyed this movie a lot  definitely trying to do right by the original and had funny moments throughout  the third act gets a little bogged down but overall worthy of the name  i hope they have a sequel so that they dont feel the need to overstuff cameos and nods to the original and can be a little more creative
Jul 18 2016,positive,i liked it dispute the other reviews i liked how the new ghostbusters
Jul 18 2016,positive,funny and well developed characters good pacing with enough references to the original to keep it tongue in cheek  best movie ive seen in a while
Jul 18 2016,negative,it is bad  phantom menace bad  perhaps the worst reboot i have seen since indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull which was technically a sequel    the fact that any recognized critics gave approval to this disaster strikes me as corrupt  paul feig is a big hero in hollywood right now  to his credit he has done some solid girl power movies  but here before we pan any actresses we must start with the director  awful  special effects  the big payoff at the end looked like a guy dressed in a white blanket  slimer looked no better than he did over 30 years ago  the slime did not work either    before we pan the actresses we must also address the writing  what writing    alternative premise  do a sequel  dan akroyd and bill murray are in the loony bin because the government has convinced everyone the ghostbusters was a hoax  only their daughters believe them and they team up with their dads to prove ghosts are real  mckinnon could easily have played ackroyds daughter  i submit this 1 paragraph synopsis is a better script than the entire movie      my point anyone could produce a better script idea with 5 minutes of thought    now on to the actresses there was controversy about replacing the men with women as a pc gimmick and the verdict would be gimmick  in fact without the pc gimmick   i doubt any critic thinks twice about this film  but the pc police tell us to cheer all flicks about girl power and that thinking is as sexist as those who oppose girl power    we did not need 4 female ghostbusters  the chemistry was not there at all    in order of performance first to last  mckinnon she was on an island playing a quirky character that would have fit in perfectly as the daughter of one of the original ghostbusters  she tried her heart out to develop a character she earned the movie its star    jones i cannot stand her on snl  she plays the same crazy black girl schtick over and over  i agree with those who criticized this film for making jones the only minority  there was controversy with the fact the only black guy was not a scientist in the original film  with the benefit of hindsight this is worse  but being fair she made me smile once which is more than the rest of the female cast      melissa mccarthy the will ferrell of actresses  she has one great supporting role bridesmaids a great cameo this is 40 and people swear she can act because they have seen her do so in movies like st vincent   but generally it is the same old tired schtick  no different here    weig  whats a nice young quirky cute talented actress doing at the bottom of the barrel in a cast full of comedians mostly misfiring with the mckinnon exception  i have no idea how kristin got in this movie and hopefully her character will die off in between sequels    rest of cast hemsworth tries and perhaps gets another half star      the cameos are brutal and unnecessary      all around a complete dud of a film  save your money and let the ghostbusters reboot die a natural death just like indy
Jul 18 2016,positive,cute no new ground explored but some funny lines and a jolly good time  a nice surprise oddly one of the funniest gags is chris hemsworth as the dorkily inspired clueless geek  and he easily gets the laughs  and the girls but its still totally hilarious   a nice little reboot  it runs out of steam in the third quarter of the movie but picks back up at the end its as if they lost focus  had they added some intensity and a cliffhangerclimax this would be the adventure of the summer i think this is why the mediocre ratings abound  a bit intense for the young who will def wanna see it something to keep in mind  im glad my 9 yr old niece did not go with us shes prone to nightmares as intense as the first one  thats what i found online and its accurate  the big screen is intimidating more so than tv        3 slimy grins out of 5
Jul 18 2016,negative,i went with my wife and daughterswe didnt last 15 min and went home and watched the ogs 1 and 2
Jul 18 2016,positive,alright here we go so i cant hate this movie to be honest it was funny had action had ghosts which they looked cartoonish to me not scary and the female cast were funny they were great seeing the original cast well most of them were great to but it may not be fair to say but it really is a copy and past from the original film no matter what people say if your going to do a reboot make it your own dont change a story a tiny bit and everything else is the same thats not making a new that stands from the original this is not the case at all but over all it was good but at the end of the day dont spend a lot of money to see this i saw it in 3d for free wasnt to bad for that but its a summer movie that it pretty much on to the next one
Jul 18 2016,positive,safety lights are for dudes
Jul 18 2016,positive,very entertaining nice gender swap with chris hemsworth being the pretty but dim eye candy ripe for supernatural possession like sigourney weaver in the original while the quartet of wiig mccarthy mckinnon and jones lead the action and many big laughs it acknowledges the old with cameos and such and also makes the adventure new for a younger generation
Jul 18 2016,negative,wow i dont usually walk out of movies but i did within 20 minutes of this one and i have my cousin to thank for that as she was scared  even still this movie was terrible  it was like an adam sandler version of ghostbusters except we got annoying melissa mccarthy in a lead role  to be fair i never opposed an all female ghostbuster team although i wouldve preferred 2 men and 2 women the fact that they had to reboot a childhood franchise and change it from a comedic pop culture icon with one of the best comedic performances ever in to another melissa mccarthypaul feig movie  nothing about this film in my eyes in the first 20 or so minutes was good and i was actually happy to leave the theater    also the effects sucked p
Jul 18 2016,negative,there isnt much memorable about this movie except for how mediocre it is the jokes fall flat and entire theaters have gone through the movie without a real laugh not even one good joke the acting wasnt very good either this movie isnt much more than a little hey look at us were being forward thinking movie that only set out to be political instead of  being a good movie they called their critics misogynistic unfairly and ignored every legitimate point that was raised if this movie is remembered at all it will be remembered for its controversy not because it was something groundbreaking but because it was handled poorly and failed at living up to the standards placed by the original ghostbusters movie
Jul 18 2016,negative,absolutely horrendous thanks for shitting all over my childhood with poor special effects and a great cast that had absolutely nothing to work with
Jul 18 2016,positive,i loved this movie  women who are smart and funny save the city by themselves and the only love story is their friendship  this is the future
Jul 18 2016,positive,just plain fun with great cast and lots of girl power
Jul 18 2016,negative,for a movie that wanted to be its own thing it sure did take every opportunity to do some kind of shout out or wink to the original at the end of the day it just wasnt very goodnot awful but just wasnt good chris hemsworth stole the movie though he was hilarious and stole the screen in every scene he was in
Jul 18 2016,positive,i had no idea ghostbusters was going to be this good the pace of the film is great the actors were fantastic the all created likable characters none of which irritated me which can be a problem with movies like this my girlfriend didnt like one of them but i thought all the actors kept themselves under control hemsworth was especially funny in a movie with comedians that included mccarthy wiig and jones i thought hemsworth stood out the most the effects were also very good     they could have taken 510 minutes off the end and done a little more to make it more funny but there isnt much more i could say was wrong with it this ghostbusters could stand on its own but there are plenty of homages to the original     this movie is so worth seeing and it will definitely end up in my collection     there are some funny things going on during the credits and a quick tease after the credits in case there does end up being a sequel which i have my fingers crossed for
Jul 18 2016,negative,a bit sexist in my opinon but chris hemsworth did get some laughs  i really truly dislike the ghetto trash  way that the only person is of color is portrayed
Jul 18 2016,negative,this movie was awful such talented actors and such an awful cheesy plot line the theatre was quiet no one was laughing super disappointing
Jul 18 2016,positive,huge fan of the original but i do have to admit i cracked up a whole bunch time worthy
Jul 18 2016,negative,i didnt care for this film i nearly slept through half of it
Jul 18 2016,positive,pretty fun and entertaining the surprise cameos are cool right up until the end 
Jul 18 2016,positive,great movie good acting i just wish the villan was a bit better there is a stay after the credits scene to set up for a sequel
Jul 18 2016,negative,saw this movie with my kids and none of us thought it was very good  only kristen wiggs character was somewhat believable  kate mckinnon who i think is funny was like a shallow snl skit that lasted 2 hrs instead of 5 min they arent really afraid of any encounters with the ghosts and the whole thing was relying cheap gags for laughs  not very good and definitely not worth paying theater prices to see it  wait till its available on netflix
Jul 18 2016,positive,i really loved this one strong female leads great cgi funny moments and suspense even small cameos of the original cast must see do it just do it
Jul 18 2016,positive,it was so good i want to see it 5 more times it was funny the characters were goods it paid homage to the original with out being dependent on it most of the original cast made cameos i would die for holtz
Jul 18 2016,negative,wasted cast but then they dont have any chemistry either
Jul 18 2016,positive,firstthis isnt a remake its a redo totally different cast setup  plot differences that said i loved it great casting good plot special effects were standard fare for 2016 plot was good enough to make me laugh so hard i criedand im not easily impressed only way to improve it would be a quicker start to the plotwas slow to get going
Jul 18 2016,negative,wasted cast but then they dont have any chemistry either
Jul 18 2016,positive,i honestly didnt and still dont think we need a new ghostbusters but let me tell you this movie as its own movie was great the characters were fantastic the effects were great most of the jokes hit and if we could just be honest for a sec here anything and i mean anything beats the ghostjob from the original you know what im talking about i mean the original is a fricking classic but that one scene haunts me for life that being said i love this movie and i think it deserves a chance please just go see it before making a judgement
Jul 18 2016,positive,a bit sad about the all female cast
Jul 18 2016,negative,if there was ever a movie that represented the know nothing nature of the millennial generation ghostbusters 2016 would be it     a movie about a terrible group of personality free women who mistake tumblr style eccentricities for being the same thing as having a personality or character or something of interest to say     said women sleep walk thru a plot ripped straight from better written fiction due to a lack of creative talent of their own heck this is to the original ghostbusters what 50 shades of gray was to twilight a face off piece of poorly conceived fan fiction which reads like the person who wrote it was obsessed with the tvtropes website because every character is just a shallow series of clichés ala look everyone its a black woman who shouts everything because shes black oh isnt that funny life at how insightful we are puny humans    where ever single male character is depicted as a blundering idiot just to dumb to be able to function on their own    terrible acting out of everyone except hemsworth who is the only shinning light in this otherwise bleak movie terrible cgi terrible writing a pointless villain a pointless conclusion    and yes im going to say it this movie sucked because it was all women not because they were all women but because the writer  director made that its gimmick     thats not the gimmick of ghostbusters when the original came out the gimmick to the original wasnt look they all have penises the gimmick to the original was look there are these people  they bust ghosts ghosts who exist    apparently everyone involed with this movie thought that no this gimmick was way to mundane a better gimmick would be look all the actors have vaginas a much more extraordinary gimmick if sony is to be believed not so much so if the near empty theatre i saw it in where they gave away free tickets is to be believed    boring dumb dumbed down for an implied mentally challenged audience preachy to the point of annoyance pretentious ripping off things that are good in the most uncreative ways this is the perfect movie for the millennial generation of know nothings    for the rest of us this movie is to be avoided like the cloud of smug self centred boredom it really is
Jul 18 2016,positive,i really enjoyed this movie the characters were very relatable
Jul 18 2016,positive,this movie was utterly enjoyable
Jul 18 2016,negative,watch stranger things on netflix  80s nostalgia horror tv series    ghostbusters is terrible  if you crave 80s horror    stranger things got 80s horror right music is awesome
Jul 18 2016,positive,i really enjoyed it it was funny and clever and a gave a lot of nods to the first one but was still able to be hilarious in its own right
Jul 18 2016,negative,so many one liners that this movie seemed like an extended snl skit it had its  moments but it really does no justice to the franchise and the original movies
Jul 18 2016,positive,fun movie and a good reboot
Jul 18 2016,negative,this movie may as well have been comprised of nothing but fart jokes it was basically shit on a large screen i would say it was disappointing but it was exactly what i expected
Jul 18 2016,positive,one of the funniest movies ive seen in a while it was also extremely enjoyable to see a good twist on the classic gender roles in movies
Jul 18 2016,positive,this one was a big surprise for me  honestly had no idea what to expect but its the 3rd or 4th best movie ive seen this year so far  had the right balance of new and familiar for a reboot  all four leads were really good and not just the horribly written and acted garbage i see in most comedies that keeps me away from the genre  i laughed hard and often all throughout the film  not so sure about hemsworth  he is so unbelievably stupid here but i was getting annoyed more than i was amused  there is a high volume of cameos and i never know how to feel about those  such roles would have no reason for existing if we didnt recognize them  but it was five people and a couple ghosts we were happy to see anyway  mckinnon seems to be most peoples favorite of the new team and id probably agree but they were all great  hope we get a sequel  ill be there for sure
Jul 18 2016,negative,very mediocre film so much time was spent dillydallying and then when they made jokes half the time it was referencebased or haha arent they stupid style jokes the characters didnt make a lot of sense they didnt explain the tech well at all some parts looked like they needed a better acting take and just generally i didnt find much to like it didnt make me angry or anything just disappointed felt like they were so close to having a good movie but the director really flubbed this one with both bad dialogue and general script
Jul 18 2016,positive,im a 1980s kid and i loved the original gb this one does it justice i really enjoyed the film
Jul 18 2016,positive,excellent film i laughed out loud a whole lot and the action sequences were great too super solid performances by all the leading women and cool cameos from the original busters i aint fraud of no ghost
Jul 18 2016,positive,saw the new version of ghostbusters today a remake of the original with better effects and a fun female crew the original was a fun movie with a clever idea and one of the funniest men in films bill murray but its a 3 star film too this explains the menace and the way to fight the ghosts better the team is better established and the effects are far better it does miss those hilarious murray jokes this version has more small jokes and attitudes befitting the cast kate mckinnon is the best because shes sharper and bigger than the others but its a fun summer popcorn film overall stay through the creditstheres an extra scene at the end
Jul 18 2016,negative,taxing to sit through knowing the nostalgia factor is just out of reach cameos yes but nothing to do with the original films references to the original franchise again yes but more allusions  no real connections were given 4 characters with no real charisma reliability or charm 4 actors doing their routine schticks in costumes  a setting that may have well been another liveaction scooby doo movie
Jul 18 2016,negative,this movie should never have been made  what a waste of a beloved franchise
Jul 18 2016,positive,a fun fluffy summer film i smiled from the beginning of the film to the end
Jul 18 2016,positive,amazingly funny good amounts of humor and comedy that is well balanced with the classic campyness of the original not a shot for shot remake at all and it doesnt even try to be it stands on its own and stands strong
Jul 18 2016,negative,quite honestly this was a miserable movie this movie was more akin to a scary movie 4 attempting to pass itself off as the original material it really was one of the worst movies ive ever gone to see and im just glad i didnt pay to see it    the actors were who you expect them to be a bunch of unfunny shallow jesters who have their stake in similar acts if youve even one of their other acts then youve seen their role in this movie as well as a group of one trick ponies this movie dies very quickly into its run    as a movie run on the campaign of female empowerment instead of quality story telling and cinematic experiences this movie does very little to express anything of value morally or otherwise
Jul 18 2016,negative,this was one of the worst movies i have seen in a theater in recent years the critic ratings are clearly motivated the movie was just sad in its attempts to be funny the ending was mildly entertaining nobody in my group laughed at the lines that were meant to be funny the attempt at reversing stereotypes were revolting in the character of the idiot white male secretary
Jul 18 2016,positive,simply put walk in with an open heart and mind ignore the all girl cast ignore 30 years later ignore the hate  these girls knock it out of the park no its not the same how could it be our ghostbusters died with harold ramis this movie is fun on its own while still giving a wink to nostalgia i was very happy and the rest of the audience in that theater seemed to agree
Jul 18 2016,positive,fun movie dont late the haters sway your decision to see it this a female centric movie but not feminist movie the ghost looked amazing and it had some good laughs despite what many beloved the original was not a great comedy but it was a great movie for its time this not as great but defiantly worth price if admission
Jul 18 2016,positive,belly laughs thats all i have to say not just once but pretty steady throughout
Jul 18 2016,positive,way better than the trailers showed hit all the high notes id have liked and makes a few of its own much more character focused and a deeper world around them cannot wait for the sequel
Jul 18 2016,negative,terrible spin on a perfect classic
Jul 18 2016,negative,this movie was as funny as the time my dad said he was leaving to get his dry cleaning and never came back   how come the black one is always the streetwise nonscientist lol
Jul 18 2016,positive,hilarious i hope there is a sequel
Jul 18 2016,positive,i was very surprise how good this movie turn out to be im fan of the first two movies
Jul 18 2016,positive,loved it so funny and very creative i loved the nods to the original cant wait for the next one
Jul 18 2016,negative,i really hoped this film would surpass its uninspired marketing campaign unfortunately after seeing the movie i think better of the trailers ghostbusters is a lackluster mess with terrible writing and abysmal comedic timing the four leads were likable and performed well considering the sludge they had to work with i especially liked mckinnon and jones they seemed to be coloring outside the lines a bit while everyone else was paintbynumbers zach woods was the only supporting cast member that brought anything funny and i would have liked to see more of him in the film  sadly the story amounted to a disjointed stream of gags that were marginally funny at best none of the characters were relatable and i was never invested in what happened to any them the film had no heart no grounding nothing for the audience to grab a hold of and identify with the bones for a good movie were there but everything else was phoned in  perhaps paul feig simply cannot relate to a pg13 audience his usual rough edges and raw wit were gelded in this film resulting in flat dialog from characters that barely resembled human beings at all  the jokes were such obvious pablum that i half expected a laugh sign at the bottom of the screen frankly that might have helped
Jul 18 2016,neutral,most the jokes fell flat and there wasnt much depth to the characters
Jul 18 2016,positive,it was such a great fun movie highly recommend so inspiring to see funny women take over the reboot of a movie i loved so much as a kid
Jul 18 2016,positive,very funny with some terrific performances by the four leads as well as chris hemsworth it has a different feel from the original but different doesnt mean worse in my book definitely worth seeing
Jul 18 2016,positive,is it the original ghostbusters no did the trailer poorly market the film hell yes the movie was funny and was a contrast to the trailer especially in regards to leslie jones character the internet has lost its collective minds but as someone who can quote the first movie and part of the second line for line it didnt trample on my childhood and i left satisfied from the theater    go see it its a fun summer movie
Jul 18 2016,positive,it had its flaws and a lot of the jokes fell flat but damn this movie was a lot of fun highly recommend
Jul 18 2016,positive,enjoyable remake with references and cameos from the original
Jul 18 2016,positive,this is another one of those movies you have to go see for yourself just an all around fun movie
Jul 18 2016,positive,if you dont judge it by its predecessor you should really enjoy this movie  its its own movie  its current its funny it tells the story in a different way thats believable and doesnt dumb anything down for the audience  some of the jokes fell flat to be honest but then some jokes absolutely killed  the audience really enjoyed this overall from what i could tell and really dug all the nods to the original movie with some excellent cameos  even mr ramis got a little something and that was oh so sweet  the effects are awesome and i love how it ends  i feel this ending leaves them in a much better place than the original ghostbusters  watch gb2 if u dont believe me  for some reason everyone wants to hate this because its an allfemale cast but thats just the dumbest thing in the world  this is a really good movie and deserves a better audience than that
Jul 18 2016,positive,i thought it was really good its not a remake or a reboot of the original film its a live action adaptation of  the real ghostbusters cartoon i came to this conclusion about 20 minutes into the film and enjoyed it from beginning to end the cameos were really good and the nods to the original films were nice but murrays performance left a lot to be desired luckily it was only a couple of minutes long
Jul 18 2016,negative,why try to remake a classic
Jul 18 2016,positive,i thought it was hilarious
Jul 18 2016,neutral,dont waste your time  was very disappointed i should have looked at audience score rather than just the tomatometer the critics got this one wrong
Jul 18 2016,negative,this was terrible  it was a remake that was more like a bad rewrite  do yourself a favor and pass
Jul 18 2016,positive,to my surprise it was actually very good definitely made for best viewing in imax 3d im glad too i was so worried it would be bad i didnt think parks and rec style directing would work but it did a truly entertaining movie definitely the 2nd best one   also the 3d is very well done and highly original i recommend at least a 3d viewing also great characters
Jul 18 2016,positive,it was surprisingly entertaining
Jul 18 2016,positive,i loved this movie it was halarious it was just as good as the first one chicks rule
Jul 18 2016,positive,funny and a great homage to the original
Jul 18 2016,negative,was admittedly looking forward to this flicklove me some kristen wiig and melissa mccarthy but wowthis was not their best effort  it was cool to see slimer again very nostalgicbut the original casti had high hopes that there was going to be something cool with them but their inclusion almost felt forced and was more or less a distraction  and good lord was the bad guy was about as lame as lame gets    overall disappointed in all facets of this movie  had potentialbut really just a mediocre movie
Jul 18 2016,positive,amazing  dont listen to the naysayers they do this franchise right  
Jul 18 2016,positive,as a child of the 80s ghostbusters is my favorite movie of all time i had no desire to see this one but did and found it very funny they didnt try to make the same movie again lest harold ramis roll over i really liked it
Jul 18 2016,positive,i dont know why there are low reviews i loved it it isnt the original and some of the humour was forcedbut the acting was entertaining    loved all the cameos loved the special effects out of all the horrible remakes these days this one was great i hope they do a sequel haters need to realize that its not going to match the original which btw wasnt without its flaws either
Jul 18 2016,positive,was pretty boring and the oneliners were not that funny so pails to the originalsad considering melissa mccarthy is usually so much more funnier but i was pretty much disappointed
Jul 18 2016,positive,i aint afraid of no remake   this is simple as good as the original a wise story line good punchlines and the same elements of the original a great summer blockbuster
Jul 18 2016,positive,good summer movie interesting and fun forget the bad reviews
Jul 18 2016,positive,it wasnt as good as the original   it added a new twist
Jul 18 2016,negative,theatrical disaster horribly unfunny juvenile tasteless dump forced disgusting and most of all pathetic and desperate
Jul 18 2016,negative,i was extremely disappointed with this movie while the casting was topnotch the storyline was poorly written over all i left feeling like there was no real cohesion
Jul 18 2016,positive,a lot of fun kate mckinnon in particular is funny very delightful i didnt want it to end hoping they do a sequel
Jul 18 2016,positive,fun entertaining and the gender shouldnt be an issue to anyone  its funny well acted and a strong story
Jul 18 2016,positive,fun movie and different from the original in good ways plenty of homages though dan aykroyd is a producer and almost all the main stars make fun cameos our 9yearold daughter loved it kate mckinnon is my new best friend
Jul 18 2016,positive,has moments more in the early stages with throw away lineseffects are greatcameos workcast does their best i will take any movie with mckinnon nownever felt any true danger or fearas good as i thought it would bebut left me a tad like so many remakesnothing new to table
Jul 18 2016,positive,ok i watched the original 1984 version this afternoon in preparation i love the original movie but this this is twice as good i know im a female so i guess you can say im biased towards an all female cast but let me tell you the new ghostbusters is scarier funnier and a better written story no its not perfect and its not going to win anyone an oscar but its seriously so worth seeing it creates a new version of the story while giving the original total props   seriously see it its better than most remakes of most movies its going straight into my top 20
Jul 18 2016,negative,wow just wow   im speechless good thing i used free tickets to go see this otherwise i would have wanted my money back  wait can i get my vip free tickets s back noooo
Jul 18 2016,positive,i thought it was great its entertaining funny and a creative change from the originals i love the actresses as well it was a pleasure to see
Jul 18 2016,neutral,i really didnt know what to think of this movie going into it i really wanted a sequel following the events or at least be in timeline of the original but they decided not to that and it really didnt work the characters for the most part were unlikeable and the story was meh and not really adding anything different to the original two films there were some shining moments like chris hemsworth that added some great comedy when on screen overall its not a film a would pay to see in the theaters again it would be a movie i would stop and watch maybe if it was on tv
Jul 18 2016,positive,a fun homage to the original with a strong cast and great humour made my saturday
Jul 18 2016,positive,i enjoyed this movie very much ghostbusters was funny exciting and had some really awesome ghosts i especially loved the house fight scene towards the end i cant wait for the second one however i think they made kevin a little too stupid plus the objectifying of him could have been taken down a notch i mean janine wasnt a dumb airhead soooo why kevin
Jul 18 2016,neutral,after caving into the mad hystetia of this film i thought why not it looks entertaining enough to watch plus i loved watching the old ones when i was a kid however after watching i think the overall hype fell flat with a avetage storyline and passable acting  as much as i like kristen wiigs and melissa mccartheys comic antics i just dont think this film was the right fit and the new characters didnt really help even if there were a few funny gags here and there  generally speaking this could have been better but kudos for the effort
Jul 18 2016,positive,i believe all movie reviews should boil down to just 5 questions the movie gets 1 star for each question that you answer yes to  1did i enjoy the movie was i entertained  2was the movie worth the cost of my ticket  3would i recommend the movie to others  4would i see the movie again in the theater or rent it  5would i buy the move when its released on video    i answered no to 5 on the new ghostbusters so i gave the movie 4 stars critics suck their opinion seems to never match mine i gave warcraft 5 stars and it got panned by critics dont be a sheep your opinion about a movie is the only one that counts hopefully my 5 questions help you decide what movies to watch in the future
Jul 18 2016,positive,funny and full of character its fundamental flaw is that its not as perfect as the original  that aside there is a ton to enjoy in this film
Jul 18 2016,negative,an absolute insult to the entire ghostbusters franchise
Jul 18 2016,positive,ghostbusters was a movie that proves you really cant judge or prejudge a movie just by its trailer  i thought the trailers were awful but after seeing mostly positive reviews i thought i would give it a chance  over all it was very entertaining  i thought the first half of the movie was one of the best comedies i have seen in a while but it kind of fizzles a little by the end  it was still good but it was not on par with the original  i already figured it couldnt top the original going in but that didnt mean it couldnt be a good movie and it was better than i expected
Jul 18 2016,positive,actually pretty good  i thought kristin wiig was a little annoying but she mostly is  melissa mccarthy was really funny for once leslie jones was kind of sassy black woman character but smart too and kate mckinnon was funny and adorable  kind of have a girl crush on her  there were some smart moments i liked that they didnt follow the original movie but there were little winks at it some better than others  there were definitely a few scenes that would have been better left on the cutting room floor  all in all solid fun movie
Jul 18 2016,positive,went to see ghostbusters really to just burn some time and ended up laughing all the way through so much better than i thought it was going to be
Jul 18 2016,positive,oh its an all female ensemble with an attractive yet ditzy male receptionist i didnt notice all i know is they came they saw and they kicked ass
Jul 18 2016,positive,everything leading up to the third act had me laughing a fair amount the action packed ending seems to fall flat
Jul 18 2016,negative,could have been a great reboot but got bogged down in too many forced jokes
Jul 18 2016,neutral,wanted this to be a lot better movie but it just did not have enough laughs  the funniest part of the film was slimmer
Jul 18 2016,positive,relates and pays tribute to the original while standing on its own fun hilarious spooky action packed the new ghostbusters is a classic all its own proving the girls can ghost bust as well as the boys and i cant wait for a squeal who you gonna call
Jul 18 2016,positive,the performances from all the leads is quite strong kate mckinnon maybe chews the scenery a bit too much but everyone does an admirable job with the material chris hemsworth is the surprise he really gives it his all in the dumb blonde role as the ghostbusters secretary kevin    the script is a bit weak the villains plot doesnt make a ton of sense some of the jokes dont land very well either due to the writing or being spoiled by the trailers though i have to give them props for the plot being less of a retread of the original movie than the trailers made it seem    overall i enjoyed the movie quite a bit the characters plot and action work well enough for an entertaining evening i would also try to see this movie in 3d if you could they do some really neat stuff by having the effects penetrate the letterbox that really makes the action scenes pop in a fantastic way
Jul 18 2016,positive,ive you enjoyed the humor and wit of the first ghostbusters movie youll enjoy this film the new and interesting characters gave it a fresh take dont listen to the hypocrites and go give this movie a chance im glad i did
Jul 18 2016,positive,loved this movie i could watch it again and again immediate classic
Jul 18 2016,positive,the big question that has probably been on a lot of peoples minds is the new ghostbusters worth it     absolutely that would be a yes from me it might even surprise you just how good it is    lets just clear the air the all female cast does not ruin the nostalgia of the original of course i was not among those who thought or assumed it would it does in fact do quite the opposite it provides a great means for creating something fresh and original out of a cult classic and even more it goes out of its way to give appropriate screen time to honouring its predecessors the way that it incorporates the name the logo and things like the familiar car are incredibly tasteful and wonderfully imagined in the script it does it in a way that allows those of us who grew up with the male cast to feel immediately comfortable while also paving the way for a new generation of audience it even takes the time to do some meaningful and funny cameos from the figures of our past which i actually needed my wife who is much better with these details to help me with fictional and real ones that are still with us and ones that are no longer     the script itself has just the right amount of creepy and fun the snl alum that grace the stage bring their trademark style but one thing that i appreciated was the way it gave wiig jones and mckinnon in particular a chance to really shine it would be easy to fall under the shadow of the dominating comic talents of mccarthy who definitely does dominate much of the film but they keep it from becoming a mccarthy project    overall i think it sets itself up to build its own character while not forgetting the past the end result is something that feels like far more than unnecessary regurgitation but actually feels fresh and welcome and maybe even necessary
Jul 18 2016,positive,i loved this even more than the original i didnt think it was possible to reboot a franchise and improve on the original i really hated the idea of the reboot but now that ive seen the movie and experienced the delight it brought to my children the same delight i experienced with the first film i know that 20 years from now my children will look back at this film and consider it an important part of their cultural childhood well worth seeing more than once
Jul 18 2016,positive,when i first walked into the theater i expected a failure and then it starts rolling and im already smiling this movie came out much better than i expected and im excited for any sequel in the near future i just want to say ernie hudsons cameo was my most favorite
Jul 18 2016,positive,loved it laughed tons
Jul 18 2016,negative,jokes were stale while the script was all over the place
Jul 18 2016,negative,who gonna watch this movie nobody
Jul 18 2016,positive,those bashing this movie are to point fingers and be blunt about it flatout sexist  the movie was perfect in every way  of course it wasnt endall the best movie of the year nor a lifechanging experience but a reboot of an old classic  the allwomen cast was not sexualized which is something important for young girls to see in movies  the characters were likable and everything was reminiscent of the classics  the cgi ghost were far better than any previous ghostbusters movies so thats definitely nothing to gripe about  overall it was funny yet not overwhelminglyso and charming  id watch it again
Jul 18 2016,positive,remember watching the original in high school this one is on par with it  took the whole family and had fun laughed and enjoyed it  dont know what all the hatred is about  i dont usually agree with the critic ratings on these movies but the got the rating right this time 73  i seriously doubt if the original was made today they would have gotten better in reading the reviews on this i do wonder how many of the negative people wrote their reiviews on nostalgia or just the previews because i didnt see a lot of potty humor feminism or terrible scripting that i have seen various people write about  at least nothing you wouldnt see in any comedy like this one  see it for yourself if you havent seen it and judge it for yourself  the nods to the old movie were nice and respectful and it was fun  to each their own i guess
Jul 18 2016,positive,hilarious the characters were   perfectly cast great chemistry i loved it laughed the whole time and my kids loved it too proof positive women can be extremely funny i saw the original in theaters and i enjoyed this version at least as much so much fun and a hemsworth to boot
Jul 18 2016,positive,not perfect but extremely entertaining
Jul 18 2016,negative,the much anticipated for better or worse ghostbusters refresh hit american soil for mass consumption last evening before we venture any further lets just address the stay puft sized elephants in the room the trailers are bad the marketing has been an exercise in futility and i was not looking forward to this film much to my surprise i did not walk out of the theater in a heated rage and my childhood affection for the original film and cast was left completely intact i did have quite a few light hearted chuckles but those were negated quickly by cringe worthy and shallow plot devices this film has been shrouded in controversy and its not outside the realm of plausibility that the true spirt of the film was left on the cutting room floor with a gentle nudge from studio handlers in all regards the finished product delivers juvenile attempts at humor underwhelming performances whiplash inducing tone shifts and special effects you swear youve seen in the last scooby doo movie    read the rest at     all controversy aside this movie does not have two legs to stand on its own
Jul 18 2016,positive,a very very pleasant surprise
Jul 18 2016,positive,fun quirky and although not a masterpiece it definitely was entertaining and worth the ticket price
Jul 18 2016,neutral,its not a terrible movie honestly if we had no idea what ghostbusters was or if you could somehow mentally divorce yourself from the original films its not that bad its worth at least a one time viewing whether in the theater or redbox honestly im not a paul fieg fan but he didnt do a bad job and im happy they cut out the dance sequence because this review probably would have went a different way it was a solid effort id grade it at a c
Jul 18 2016,negative,god awful movie wish i could get my time and money back a few alright jokes but they were all shown in the trailers
Jul 18 2016,positive,i went in with low expectations being a fan of the original moviescast and not liking the idea of an allfemale cast  feeling like it was just a marketing scheme about to go sour  anyway i  loved it  and so did my 5yearold who also loved the originals  i thought it was true to the originals spirit and humor  yeah it was no academy award winner but i didnt go expecting that  the cast had good chemistry the jokes were funny  story wasnt terribly original but i wasnt expecting that from a reboot
Jul 18 2016,positive,this movie was funny and silly and kept me smiling throughout the whole movie it kept the classic feel while being innovative
Jul 18 2016,negative,too childish tried too hard to be funny nothing like the originals
Jul 18 2016,positive,okay so i went to go see the new ghostbusters movie and i tried to avoid any reviews or movie scores cause people were already giving it bad scores even before the movie came out sooooo the movie was fantastic it was funny and fun the cast was amazing and guess what my childhood memories are still in tact
Jul 18 2016,positive,i love to see women kicking butt
Jul 18 2016,positive,yes it wasnt the original ghostbusters but i thought the film did a great job of bringing the franchise into the new generation  with so many pop culture references as well as the fantastic banter between the main cast this film is something else  i loved it immensely and hope for the sequels to be just as good or even better
Jul 18 2016,positive,i am seeing it for a third time tomorrow
Jul 18 2016,positive,a hilarious movie second funniest movie i saw this year mckinnon is a revelation and mccarthy is wonderful how does it compare to the original well if nothing else murray isnt sexually harassing the female lead for most of the movie so that makes it so much better
Jul 18 2016,negative,affirmative action movie feminism is hurting both sides of the aisle feels like they are trying to hard for scifi it still dosent make sense to me while the original movie makes it seem somewhat believable that these guys were a amateurs this movie makes it seem like these girls are military experts total fluff film not believable comedy seems forced on you blaaah
Jul 18 2016,positive,i have to admit i was prepared for an absolutely awful movie based on the terrible job done in the previews turns out the movie was funny it was well done they did a good job of following the first story in a general sense without trying to recreate it step by step in the end it was fun it wont win any awards but its definitely not what i expected to see either and thats a good thing they did a good job
Jul 18 2016,negative,as a huge ghostbusters fan i was so excited for this movie i love the original and i was super stoked for this movie when it was announced however i was extremely dissapointed there are times when this movie is very creative and those parts are where i found myself really liking it kate mckinnon gives a great performance and so do leslie jones and kristen wigg but alas this movie sinks faster than watching titanic on fast forward it plays out like a needy teenager seeking approval from hisher friends but always pales in comparison to its livlier more laid back older sibling it panders to a political audience and forgets the fans who made ghostbusters a phenomenon in the first place
Jul 18 2016,positive,great laughs definitely a must see
Jul 18 2016,positive,really good except wish we wouldve seen the ghost from the girl pastwhen 8 years old
Jul 18 2016,positive,for those who decided to hate this film before seeing it i doubt this movie wouldve pleased them no matter what it was but this is a solid comedy action flick i went in wanting to like it but having my doubts after all mccarthy and kristen wiig movies tend to be hit and miss but what felt like a stroke of genius to me was that these comedic big names were cast as the straight serious characters leaving mckinnon and jones to be the absurd yet incredibly entertaining comedic characters while i understand that the visuals may have bothered some it never felt like it was taking itself too serious this is already one of my favorite movies of the year all i suggest is that instead of boycotting for moviegoers to see it before judging
Jul 18 2016,negative,it sucked a big one
Jul 18 2016,positive,there arent enough female actioncomedy movies like this i saw it in 3d and loved every minute kate mckinnon was hilarious
Jul 18 2016,negative,what an embarrassment if you liked the original the see a rerun and pass on this poorly acted poorly scripted redo
Jul 18 2016,negative,the movie was lacking in well thought character development the gags seemed way too forced and just plain stupid the special effects were not done well would not recommend to anyone honestly
Jul 18 2016,positive,it has its good moments  its bad
Jul 18 2016,positive,this was a really fun moviedefinitely see it in 3dimax if at all possible  really enjoyed the cameos from the original cast
Jul 18 2016,negative,this film is just an overly long poor quality snl sketch  instead of trying to build up any kind of story or character development  we just have 2hrs of joke setups oneliners and quips  every person in this movie acts like an improv actor instead of an actual human being and there was absolutely zero effort put into creating the movie worlds physics  the sciences and paranormal physics are completely controlled by toontown rules  things happen purely based on whether or not it would be funny  i seriously think sony is gaming the tomatometer here  just no way any critic could possibly find anything of redeeming value in this film  its certainly not better than the fantastic 4 reboot
Jul 18 2016,positive,it did take a bit to get going but once it got its footing it came into its own it definitely held its own from the original wasnt that great on the all female cast going in as it being a reboot but they pulled it off and made it work definitely worth seeing just dont go in with to high of expectations
Jul 18 2016,positive,this movie was surprisingly very good highly recommend itd
Jul 18 2016,neutral,its merely okits not original its not smart its not cleverbut at no point did i feel like i should just get up and leave it is about as good on all levels as ripd which got hammered by critics so take from that what you will go see it if you want to you might enjoy yourself
Jul 18 2016,positive,really funny and although the specialeffects got a bit busy at the end well worth the money particularly if you see it in 3d  in fact im probably going to see it again  great summer flick
Jul 18 2016,positive,its been years since i saw the original so i wasnt comparing it  very entertaining  much better than expected  loved the quartet of ghostbusting women
Jul 18 2016,positive,i quite enjoyed this film
Jul 18 2016,positive,incredibly enjoyable wonderfull cast with high energy fun
Jul 18 2016,positive,let me preface my actual review by saying that i was skeptical and fearful that this movie was going to suck the trailer had moments that i found intriguing and many moments that i found disquieting so my desire to go see the movie in the theater was low but when i plop my money down and the damage to my wallet is done im there to have fun and im glad i went it was fun     the biggest gripe i had going into the movie was that it wasnt a continuation of the original two stories why oh why i had said i was so angry that they didnt tie this story into the previous ones having seen the movie now i can understand why they went with a reboot the story they tell in this movie wouldnt work as is with the original stories as predecessors i still would have liked to see this be gb3 rather than a total reboot but im less angry about it now having seen the film    the other big gripe i had was that based solely on that trailer the characters and therefor the humor looked very onedimensional the trailer made it look like abby yates melissa mccarthy was going to be all physical comedy and patty tolan leslie jones was going to be an obnoxious loudmouth and yes there is some of that but probably most of it is what you already see in the trailer all of the characters are goofy in their own way but as it should be they all bring their own thing to the cast perhaps the most onedimensional character is that of chris hemsworths kevin beckman who serves as their shockingly dumb yet surprisingly hilarious secretary but despite or because of the sheer idiocy of the character somehow scenes with hemsworth are actually some of the funniest in the entire film     generally i would say ghostbusters is about subtle often cerebral humor the kind of stuff that you have to pay attention in order to fully appreciate much to my pleasant surprise theres plenty of that in gb2016 there is also some more lowbrow humor that might appeal more to an audience less used to having to think for their laughs i could have done without one or two of the lessthansophisticated jokes but i was largely pleased with the humor in this film    something i was very curious about going into the movie was the cameos bill murray dan akroyd ernie hudson sigourney weaver and annie potts all had cameos in the movie some were more substantial than others some even opening the door for future appearances but all were fun even harold ramis had a cameo of sorts and that was a very nice little moment the movie by the way was dedicated to harold ramis so that gets points in my book    overall this felt like a tribute to the original film the story was familiar yes but had plenty of new twists and really the familiar parts felt to me more like they were paying homage to the roots of the franchise rather than just reusing the same elements there are loads of references and nods to the other films and even to the animated series a bit my brother and i were regularly saying did you see that nod just now and they do a nice job of balancing the comedic and horror moments and the music is great theres a particular scene where the music swells with a familiar theme right as the action peaks i actually got chills and i wasnt alone    my final words if youre a ghostbusters fan you should see this movie its silly fun doesnt take itself too seriously and if youre at all an adaptable person openminded person i would guess it wont ruin your childhood
Jul 18 2016,positive,i really likes the movie it was different then the original which i liked and was pretty funny our teens loved and yes they have seen the original many times i liked seeing the original cast in cameos i thought mckinnon was the funniest in the movie
Jul 18 2016,positive,love this remake  good cast and 3d
Jul 18 2016,positive,great fun a worthy successor and a great retelling that manages not to be a retread and i say that as someone whos a thorough fan of the original looking forward to seeing it again and eventually owning it and also be still my geeky heart to owning the inevitable fantastic fan art products that are sure to pop up on society6 any day now if they havent already and my kid is already itching for a rewatch and a sequel
Jul 18 2016,positive,its definitely worth the watch  this movie is way better than ghostbusters 2 and the reimagined cast is fantastic  this movie might falter for those that have not watched the original ghostbusters movie however this movie reminded me of how much i love the franchise and im glad to see it being brought to a new generatino i aint afraid of no ghost
Jul 18 2016,negative,i found it disjoint and mostly not funny  i found that olya povlatsky was not used to her full potential  the comedians were top notch but they were reading unfunny material
Jul 18 2016,positive,i was glad to see that this film stands on its own as a brand new movie i was afraid they would attach it to the other ghostbusters but glad they didnt that allows those movies to stand on their own and this and any sequels to stand on their own plenty of laughs great scenes and just a fun fun movie anxious to see it again
Jul 18 2016,negative,worst movie ever hated every second of it
Jul 18 2016,negative,as a way to find respite from the summer swelter i found myself sitting in a dark movie theater watching this i fell asleep twice during the movie and didnt care this movie sucks but the air conditioning at the greenwood mall stadium 10 gets 5 stars
Jul 18 2016,positive,a really fun summer movie  just the right amount of callbacks to the original
Jul 18 2016,positive,fun summer movie hilarious at times but some flat moments as well  i also felt that way about the original ghostbusters films for me they were much more about funny moments than greatness from beginning to end  i felt melissa mccarthy was wasted as a straight character and by straight i dont mean her orientation but her personality she makes a great prankster and in this film she was the normal one who gave three come on guys dont worry about what people think about us were scientists speeches  kate mckinnon was amazing a thoroughly original goofball villain played by an excellent actor i wish hed had more to do thor actor as the mimbo receptionist was a hoot  biggest flaw was that the last act was too reminiscent of 911 for comfort it took me out of the fantasy world of the movie  i would have liked them to explore the story of the first ghost moreshe was the most interesting apparition
Jul 18 2016,negative,worst piece of garbage ever
Jul 18 2016,positive,loved this movie it was a ton of fun and really well executed highly recommend
Jul 18 2016,positive,really enjoyable its refreshing to have an all female lead cast its all clever ghosty science stuff and comedy which makes a nice change from hot chicks in tight outfits  kate mckinnon is fantastic but i liked the chemistry between all of them  its a really fun film
Jul 18 2016,negative,worst movie i have seen in theater this year
Jul 18 2016,positive,almost every single negative review i read of this movie reads the same as all the negative comments on youtube complaining how its not the same as the original and how theyre pushing this feminist agenda and other bs these are unjust reviews that are pointlessly bashing a film without actual critique if it werent for the box office numbers id swear most of them didnt even go see it only posted a negative score just to give it a negative score     the movie has issues and flaws but not nearly enough to warrant all the hate the actresses were good the effects on the whole were good the action was above and beyond that of the original yes better than the original and while the story does retread a lot of the original the film really shines when it decided to do its own thing the humor is lacking in some places ill admit but in others it works really well     unlike reboots like planet of the apes and robocop this movie actually can be made into a franchise because its willing to try something different within the same parameters as the original it has a lot of potential and i think that the sequels will be able to break away from the first movie to keep doing their own thing making it better that potential shouldnt be wasted just because they remade something from your childhood
Jul 18 2016,negative,what a terrible movie this is such a slap in the face to the original and i am not sure how th ehell they convinced a studio to fund this
Jul 18 2016,positive,this was better than expected while it isnt enormously funny the cast all did a decent job with what they had the problem was the overload of average cgi effects and the whole reboot issue this movie was pointless it added nothing to what the original delivered and wasnt as good if youre going to make such a movie at least be different this is just a paintbynumbers remake with a female cast
Jul 18 2016,negative,had its moments but overall it was a pretty big disappointment
Jul 18 2016,positive,the first fifteen minutes were awkward but once the movie hit its stride it was excellent i expected a train wreck instead i was pleasantly surprised i loved the original and this was a perfect spiritual successor to that film lets just forget that ghostbusters ii existed this can take its place im looking forward to a sequel melissa mcarthy needs to do more work like this where she isnt just the female version of zach galifianakis also anything that kate mckinnon is in im willing to go see if bill murray were to be reincarnated as a female she would be the result
Jul 18 2016,positive,it was just pure fun the whole time it wont change your life unless your life is not very fun then it will add a certain quintessential funness to it
Jul 18 2016,negative,i scowerd the reviews for this film and i believe jack r was the most intelligent and well articulated reviewer to sum it up best if rather lengthy    if you simply view this as a standalone comedy with no history preceding it it doesnt succeed very well the script is well pretty stupid it certainly doesnt do the four talented actresses starring in the main roles any favors im sure the pg13 rating didnt help but the ladies are not very funny in this not all the jokes fall flat but they fail more than they succeed kate mckinnon is amusingly crazy and wacky throughout and leslie jones has a few good lines but thats basically it kristen wiig and melissa mccarthy are serviceable but uninspired and boring   and  the dialogue suffers there are at least several cringeinducing moments where the stars visibly struggle through their lines the villain is uninspired and easy to forget with no real motivation other than being the bad guy all of the cgi looks terrible and is vastly overused the film comes to a crescendo on the worst greenscreen times square ive ever seen and ends with i swear to god a shotforshot remake of the climax of big hero 6     addtionally yes these things happen  nothing you like about the original movie is on display here the two films arent even similar if the original is groucho marx the reboot is straight three stooges bill murray vs chevy chase to put it another way  the easiest comparison to make here is this its like a very bad adam sandler movie or a long snl skit gone wrong its full of dumb jokes that because there are girls must now be girl jokes the initial meeting of the new team shows them bonding over a tape of mckinnon queefing for example and so on not to say all the jokes are terrible again there are moments of chuckling throughout but also many more times where i just felt embarrassed for the participants  what else to say the plot is thin the science nonsensical the jokes are dumb and the ending is awful throw in the horrible cgi and it starts to sound like im talking about another sony summer movie that was equally terrible however no one was accused of misogyny for saying they didnt like mystique    i almost wrote my own review and did see the movie but this was so honestly written with intelligence and articulation it was moot you see everyone loves likes dislikes or hates a movie for a reason regardless of what you might think or say there is always an emotional reason that triggered your opinion not just i just liked it if your english communication professor told you to see this movie and then gave you the assignment to write a 1 page report on why you did or did not like it do you really think because would be an acceptible answer there are so many lackluster and generic opinions that fail to fully inform typically because humans let their emotions take over their cognetive capabilities to articulate a well thought out opinion i am not against female actresses i have a house full of women but when your 1013 year old girls stare with blank faces at the trailer and tell you the ghosts look cartoony why are they yelling and it looks bad they tells you something about the movie itself i love melissa but only in the context of mike and molly the show is hilarious and it shows off her real talent outside of heat with sandra bullock i find all her movies are horribly written foul mouthed and just really bad i like to laugh i love a good laugh but these woman are not funny the critics are padded because ad revenue is a powerful thing to garner the right reviews or they lack intelligent accuity and many of the 5 star oneliner posts are generated by the studios or companies hired to do so on their behalf they did it with fake critics back in the 90s and were busted for it did you really think with social media they stopped when word of mouth could tank a movie please they stil do everything they can to raise a tanking score like fake accounts why else do you think they are so short because they can post it faster if you have to see it just out of curiousity pay as little as possible take a day off from work and see it on cheap tuesdays our city is 5 without 3d give the studios as little money as possible
Jul 18 2016,positive,this movie was amazing i brought my boyfriend to see this the day it came out and it was so good the cast was funny and there were so many shout outs the the original  film im really glad i saw this in theaters and would recommend it to all of my friends
Jul 18 2016,positive,the ads did a poor job promoting this because they made the new movie look like a copy of the old just with gender roles reversed thats not even remotely true while there are many familiar elements this has its own story the new ghostbusters team are not just female equivalents of the male originals but are fully fleshed out  original characters all five members of my family enjoyed the heck out of this except that the seven year old didnt like the ghosts she did however ask me this morning if we could go see it again despite the ghosts
Jul 18 2016,negative,what a steaming pile of crap save yourself the money and watch the haunted mansion because this movie was obviously modeled much more off of it than the original ghostbusters unfortunately people are being shamed into reviewing this movie in a positive light because of a false flag feminism argument drummed up by the execs at sony because they panicked after seeing the backlash when they released their first looks at the product for the record i love all 4 actresses they chose for the ghostbusters and was hoping for comedic gold from them but they were not given anything to work with the jokes were written for the ten and under crowd
Jul 18 2016,negative,the movie wasnt funny  needed cameos to pull its weight   the best part of the movie was the end because i got to leave  kate mckinnon  chris hemsworth were actually pretty funny 
Jul 18 2016,positive,a great new ghostbusters movie to enhance the legacy i really enjoyed it it was funny great callbacks and smart jokes peppered in and referenced later for those paying attention i want to see it again
Jul 18 2016,negative,just sucked so much i dont want to spend time writing about it and you shouldnt spend time watching it
Jul 18 2016,negative,not even mediocre the jokes were stale and predictable the writing was horrible and the cast didnt mesh well
Jul 18 2016,positive,i went in with admittedly low expectations and was laughing the whole time  been awhile since ive been to a  movie as fun as this one
Jul 18 2016,positive,im a picky movie viewer but this was just fun while its not necessarily ground breaking the actors nailed the comedy and there were good laughs throughout really enjoyed watching the women kick butt
Jul 18 2016,positive,saw this yesterday  super fun   clever extras
Jul 18 2016,positive,dont get lost in the debate of why they remade it or its not the same it isnt the same but my girl and i enjoyed it very much funny different and very entertaining go enjoy yourself
Jul 18 2016,negative,the reason the critics like it is because of all the politically correct bs in it mccarthy had some funny spots in an otherwise bad remake its like a forced joke its just not good save your money
Jul 18 2016,positive,i grew up on the ghostbuster cartoons and was excited for the reboot this is another installment in the next generation chick flick loved it
Jul 18 2016,positive,it was ok it was funny it didnt need to be a ghostbusters movie everything ghostbusters related was window dressing in the original the tech had clear and defined limitations not here at the end the proton packs are just guns and whips in the original they where like lassos or fishing lines they trapped not killed so it wasnt action it was problem solving it was fantastical science
Jul 18 2016,positive,funny and entertaining  however it relied too heavily on the original material
Jul 18 2016,negative,this seemed like a soullesspun intended reboot and i kept waiting for big laughs that never happened it wasnt as bad as the trailer made it look but it really never makes any kind of impact i did like that it had some darker undertones but they never seemed to explore those enough the cameos were plentiful but most didnt add anything i was especially disappointed with kristen wiigs character i like her a lot but her character kind of fell flat as the straight man hopefully they can get some better writers for the next once since they have a talented cast they could do more with
Jul 18 2016,neutral,well in typical hollywood fashion there are no real new ideas just old ones redone and such is the case with ghostbusters  i will say that it at least has enough different about it that i enjoyed the  flick but it isnt great  so instead of four guys we have four women who are the busters and the story is different enough that fans of the original wont be rolling their eyes the whole time  i think the first half of the film is pretty dang funny but the second half the laughs arent quite there  here we have four of the top female comics but ironically some of the best laughs come from the male supporting character in chris hemsworth who normally is an action guy  certainly the effects are better then what we had 30 years ago and if this was an original it might stand just as tall as the original did all those years  ago  however it isnt so for those who have never seen the original i think you will enjoy this more then for  those of  us who have seen it
Jul 18 2016,negative,not funny special effects were cheesy but not in a funny way i was hoping for an entertaining bad movie like victor frankenstein 2015 but it wasnt that either
Jul 18 2016,negative,this movie was gradea shit
Jul 18 2016,positive,fun  funny went opening weekend and will be back with my daughter
Jul 18 2016,positive,funnier and more personalty to the characters
Jul 18 2016,negative,save your money and call someone else how this is getting higher reviews than the warcraft movie is beyond me no tie into the originals at all and seems like a missed opportunity
Jul 18 2016,positive,this ghostbusters is set in a new world but even so it pays homage to the original in cleaver and subtle ways the cast is excellent the acting is solid the special affects are clearly cgi but they try to capture the look and feel of the ghosts in the original as such they can look a bit unrealistic or like cartoon video games but thats not even an issue because the story is solid its not the original ghostbusters its a whole new team in a whole new continunity and they do a wonderful job i went into this movie not expecting a lot due to all the negativity i heard but in the end that helped the film because i wasnt expecting much and my expectations were raised through the roof by this entertaining film i would go see it again and it is one i would buy when it comes out i cant wait for the sequel to come out
Jul 18 2016,positive,it was fun but in a way you can tell its more for kids but being a kid on the inside i enjoyed it 
Jul 18 2016,positive,the trailers for this movie were really bad  i wonder if that was on purpose  its like they picked out all the worst parts  the actual movie was quite good  not all comedies make me laugh consistently throughout  this one did
Jul 18 2016,positive,if you can get past all the negativity prerelease you will find a really fun film that was able to ensemble a great main cast with kate mckinnon as a highlight and find its own way to work well with the premises established by the originals a great watch
Jul 18 2016,negative,all flash and no substance  an excuse to have 3d powervomit
Jul 18 2016,positive,it was funny and a good representation of what ghostbusters would be today
Jul 18 2016,positive,i didnt realize how keenly i was missing a movie like this until i had it it was an awesome experience
Jul 18 2016,positive,i really wanted to like this movie the idea of four female ghostbusters is okay by me but the movie still needed some male characters beyond the chris hemsworth who portrayed an annoying twit kate mckinnon was the happy surprise kristen wiig was weak and does leslie jones know how to deliver lines without always shouting illustrating that a skit comedian does not an actor make amazing ghosts and some cool action but ive never seen a movie try so hard and put so much effort into setting up the next movie ghostbusters made me laugh made me jump made me look at my watch and didnt make me excited for the next installment
Jul 18 2016,positive,its not shakespeare but its funny  its a lighthearted comedy  dont get hung up on the little things and just enjoy and youll have a great time  also kate mckinnon is awesome
Jul 18 2016,positive,the plot of the movie was decent but nothing to write home about what i really loved though was the fact that the main characters were not shown as typical hollywood stereotypes of women eg strong only when supported by a man squealing when touched by something gross etc they are all smart in their own ways no one comments on the jumpsuits not looking sexy or making their butts look big they are supportive not catty and it was great to see the women kick butt and save the damsel in this case the pretty but dumb chris hemsworth while that bit of feminist propaganda was a bit heavy handed the rest of the role reversals felt very natural  women can be brilliant scientists and engineers women can create things women can fight and women can be hilarious loved it
Jul 18 2016,positive,this is a good enjoy fun movie  the humor works the characters are very good and each of them have something to do
Jul 18 2016,positive,a good fun family film
Jul 18 2016,positive,while the plot didnt entirely come together the overall movie was outstanding and exceeded expectations
Jul 18 2016,positive,i am the true definition of a ghostbusters fan i have seen the original over a hundred times and i still watch the cartoon on a weekly basis nothing can ever recreate the magic of the first movie however everyone needs to let go of the idea that any reboot or remake can achieve that goal unless the original movie was terrible  instead of comparing the laughs the flow and the actors performances to the old movie or what people think they remember from watching it once or twice in their life instead of focusing on the current actress performances i only had one concern going in to watch this movie does this reboot match the true mythology of the story and would a true fan be happy with that i am happy to say yes it does and yes i am  i was transported back into a world where ghostbusters exist and loved every moment of proton beams and slime being thrown  the ghosts were amazing and so were all the graphics the movie also had quite a few laughs along the way everything about the ghostbusters the equipment and how they came to be was carefully crafted to still be original but managed to reflect all the iconic features from the past films and cartoons that had a true fan like me drooling  if anything they expanded on ideas that were skipped over in the past and invented some really amazing new tools and plot points they provided logical explanations to how things occurred or came to be all of which made sense and still were true to the ghostbusters universe and the story they were telling the overall plot using a human villain was quite amusing and reminded me of several episodes from the old cartoon series  if you are a true fan of ghostbusters the ideas and mythologies that actual make up the whole story and the whole representation which was 2 movies and 3 cartoons series not just 1 movie then you will not be disappointed with this one
Jul 18 2016,positive,was alright the comedy was a bit too much like an snl skit than the dry and campy style i was hoping for honestly this movie is a few reedits away from being serviceable patty actually stole the show for me as being the only character that seemed realistic
Jul 18 2016,positive,despite widespread remake fatigue this was a genuinely enjoyable movie  i disagree with the popular consensus it was actually funnier than the original  and i do still love the original  the entire theater was laughing pretty much nonstop by the end
Jul 18 2016,positive,albeit an extreme reboot for the franchise it still managed to help its own with witty lines and distinct personalities however theres an apparent need for improvement in writing if a sequel will ever need to be considered
Jul 18 2016,negative,just watch it on cable or netflix not worth the movie ticket
Jul 18 2016,positive,solid if unremarkable reboot with slightly more pros than cons
Jul 18 2016,positive,wonderful comedic feminist blockbuster
Jul 18 2016,positive,stellar cast totally engaging  a completely separate entity than the original  i cannot speak highly enough about kate mckinnon in this film  chris hemsworth nearly stole the show with his hilariously obtuse kevin  the villain was a little weak but the thrust of his purpose was fleshed out and sensible  i quite enjoyed it and will see it again
Jul 18 2016,positive,i can see very clearly why this movie has drastically different scores from critics and from general moviegoers the movie itself is actually amazing what stuck out to me most was the gorgeous cinematography but there were other very excellent parts which i could list of i had the time but there is a very clear hollywood rolereversal the main characters are all women and any of the men are minor actors usually portrayed as dumb or flawed in some other way this is making men very amber because theyre used to seeing it the other way around they dont like seeing themselves portrayed as dumb or unimportant   i have some news for anyone who hasnt caught on yet women dont like that either and i think a part of this new ghostbusters was trying to show people that its important to have a diverse cast genderwise while also showing that a movie with all female leads has a capacity to stand up just as well as a movie with no female leads
Jul 18 2016,positive,i went in to see ghostbusters with low expectations the original crew already took a stab at a sequel that got butchered by studio meddling so it seemed like a reasonable assumption that any other group that tried to tackle it would suffer the same fate    i was both right and wrong the movie overall is still a horrendous poorly edited jumble however the 2016 ghostbusters manages to elevate itself above the previous sequel on the backs of some seriously funny talented and passionate people id been afraid that the genderswap was just a cheap gimmick and perhaps it may have even started out as one but the casting is an unexpected stroke of brilliance kate mckinnon absolutely steals the showher zany tinker holtzmann is a character archetype that is hard to pull off without being grating but mckinnon sells it with such panache that i was quickly won over jones mccarthy and wiig all hold their own as well and chris hemsworth shows off surprising comedic chops the trailers absolutely does not do anyones performance justice    unfortunately the studios mishandling of the movie goes beyond the trailers and pervades the entire film ghostbusters tries to go in too many different directions at once and the end result is a sloppy incoherent messalbeit a really fun one youll notice that most of the leads come from a sketch comedy background and it shows because the film winds up essentially being a collection of hilarious sketches that are only tenuously related the standout here is chris hemsworths job interview scene its one of the funniest movie scenes ive seen in years but it doesnt really belong in the same film as everything else     not only does the movies tone swing wildly from one scene to the next the entire plot does at timesplot points and characterization get set up in one scene only to be ignored or even outright contradicted later there are definitely some bits that felt they got inserted just because some studio exec thought that they ought to be in there somewhere this includesyep you guessed itthe outofplace obligatory action sequence that seems to get bolted on to literally everything thats not a romance flick these days mckinnon valiantly does her best to salvage the big fight scene but ultimately it still feels unnecessary    for all of its flaws though ghostbusters is still hilariously fun and includes some truly cantmiss performances i almost skipped it and im thoroughly glad i didnt
Jul 18 2016,negative,i find it hilarious that studio executives have paid top critics for favorable ratings because this film is nothing but a cash grab aiming to create a franchise for future cash grab movies the movie is absolutely horrendous from the humor to the plot to overwhelming use of special effects in a weak attempt to carry the shambles of a script to the 2 hour mark
Jul 18 2016,positive,i loved this movie i was a bit nervous due all negative press months before it was ever released but it turn out to be awesome movie it has great background to characters motivation and why their friendship broke up initially as well as startup i was bit nervous about remake but he took old story and made it his own i also love women in role that arent solely there as love interest without clear personality like all bond girls characters were not 2 dimensional i hope hollywood make more like this in mu lifetime
Jul 18 2016,positive,fantastic for the whole family
Jul 18 2016,negative,forgettable and low brow schlock  the original ghostbusters is smart dry witty and perhaps a perfect film  i did my best to go in with an open mind but this was an insult to the property
Jul 18 2016,positive,i really liked yes it was silly but still very enjoyable with great cameos thrown in the mix
Jul 18 2016,positive,i loved it and found it quite hilarious yes its a remake but you know that going in i think the movie stands on its own i never thought id see a movie where a character could  pull the spotlight away from melissa mccarthy but kate mckinnonhotlzman did she was the best
Jul 18 2016,positive,it was an entertaining summer blockbuster will see again this cast is just getting started cant wait to see the next round
Jul 18 2016,positive,they did a great job of keeping the old theme but changing it completely  well done and the special effects are great  fun time
Jul 18 2016,neutral,occaisonaly funny never hysterical and lacking a twist but a nice escape for two hours on a hot summer afternoon reboots a franchise that did not need rebooting would have played much better as a passing the torch movie that continued the story instead of a cameo filled remake
Jul 18 2016,neutral,funny some ghosts are well made some others are pretty bad it was entertaining not sure i will watch it a second time though
Jul 18 2016,negative,i was excited to see the trailer for the first time and i was rudely disappointed the only thing i laughed at was melissa mccarthy getting titoslapped and i thoroughly cringed at the black stereotyping then the misandrist backlash came with the propagandamangina paul feig riding the wave like a eunuch on its trusty  rainbowretching eunuchorn i couldnt care less if the movie is mildly successful
Jul 18 2016,positive,i went in boot expecting much out of it but it was actually really entertaining
Jul 18 2016,positive,it wasnt the best movie in the world but it was definitely enjoyable it had some nostalgic moments in there which i loved and i like pretty much anything melissa mccarthy is in so id say i got my moneys worth
Jul 18 2016,positive,very funny the story line flowed very well and i wouldnt mind seeing it again
Jul 18 2016,positive,i went into this movie expecting it to be pretty bad mainly because of all the negative reviews ive seen very quickly this movie separated itself from the original and a very different and unique story line came into play    the movie was really well done i really enjoyed the main antagonist in this movie creating devices to draw the ghosts out unlike the original movie where the ghosts show up without reason    i look forward to what they do with the franchise down the road
Jul 18 2016,positive,actually thought it was pretty awesome and chris hemsworth was hilarious
Jul 18 2016,positive,great job on the remake very funny and not too cheesy
Jul 18 2016,negative,cash grab all the way to sell glowing dildos and toys a disrespect to any gb fan f this piece of s
Jul 18 2016,negative,not sure who the intended audience was but it was a really bad movie  i am actually really confused about the higher ratings because i must have watched a different movie  either that or the higher ratings are just being overly generous for some reason
Jul 18 2016,positive,it blew away my expectations i loved it
Jul 18 2016,positive,i honestly dont understand the hate i really enjoyed it it wasnt the greatest plot ever but it worked kate mckinnon absolutely stole the show i liked her more than kristen wiig and melissa mccarthy not because they were bad but because the character she created totally cracked me up i saw it in imax 3d and it was worth every penny i smiled every time one of the original cast made their cameos and i liked how they fit everything i loved in the original in but still made a new movie     if you hate reboots or think the original was too much of a classic to redo then fine obviously you dont want to see this i didnt care so i judged it on its own merits and was sad when the last scene faded out
Jul 18 2016,positive,fun enjoyable but completely forgettable    there were a couple of legitimately spooky bits some legitimate laughs and a few jokes that fell completely flat but i can only remember the names of the main characters if i dedicate some brainpower to the task it was ably acted for the most part but the characters were just kind of bland and uninteresting i got the feeling that in some cases they tried to substitute antics and oneliners for actual character development
Jul 18 2016,negative,to keep this simple    this movie was a painfully mediocre mess for the first half and an absolute boring piece of  for the second half i think they showed a lot of potential throughout this movie but nothing paid off nothing was well explored and clearly no one gave a crap    its a real shame with this cast with this director and this property it should have been a safe bet but it sucked
Jul 18 2016,positive,brilliant rewritten for todays generation ladies take a bow amazing stand out performance thank you for including many of the orginal cast in cameos
Jul 18 2016,positive,amazingly good stop hating and give these women their props
Jul 18 2016,negative,i dont even know where to begin
Jul 18 2016,negative,not only is this not funny its excruciating  why poehler and fey werent thought of for this venture is beyond me  the script is a shadow of the first movie with no original thought whatsoever they tried to remake the original movie with worse jokes worse twists worse actors and well everything worse about it
Jul 18 2016,positive,i loved this movie it was really fun and entertaining the whole time clever silly and serious all at once i almost didnt go because of the bad reviews im so glad i went anyway  i would love to see it again
Jul 18 2016,positive,a fun time with some crazy ladies loved it
Jul 18 2016,positive,saw it in 3d yesterday loved it these ladies r funny
Jul 18 2016,positive,loved it recently viewed the original ghostbusters and realized it had the same silly funneither are going to change the world however the script in this one was good the comedians in the lead roles were excellent and i loved the nods to the original movie its also nice to see women scientistsworrying about tenure thinking about their profession and kicking ass for once the focus is not on what these women look like and that is refreshingand there are even subtle jokes based on that take your age appropriate daughters and sons and let them think that they can face their fears and maybe save or change the world
Jul 18 2016,positive,absolutely fantastic dont let the haters get in the way
Jul 18 2016,negative,it was terrible painful to watch kate mckinnon over acting the attempt at the xmen slow motion scene was a mess wished it would have finished midway into the movie
Jul 18 2016,negative,not funny most jokes are lamebad cgi start ok but goes downhill on the second actthe final 30 min are just awful
Jul 18 2016,positive,absolutely fantastic but i would recommend everyone to go see it in an imax theatre what a great movie so much fun to watch it had us laughing out loud quite a few times and some great scares through the amazing imax 3d effects we loved every minute of it its also worth watching the original beforehand to refresh your memory since there are many references to the original
Jul 18 2016,positive,i really loved this movie i thought that the actresses  were both hilarious and fun to watch i also love how they gave a shout out to their haters
Jul 18 2016,positive,very worthy reboot of the franchise saw it once and already want to see it again
Jul 18 2016,positive,super funny and fun not the same as the original but a great movie in its own right
Jul 18 2016,positive,i came in expecting a bad movie or nothing better than average  but the movie ended up being much better than expected getting me and everyone else in the theatre to laugh throughout the film
Jul 18 2016,positive,if you didnt like this movie im sorry you hate joy and fun i hope your life gets better soon
Jul 18 2016,negative,as a fan of both the original ghostbusters film it bugged me that they considered rebooting the franchise but i wanted to give it due atttention however this is not a reboot the story editing pacing and charachters in a way are either the same or a jumble of both the original films not only that but lines in the script where also stolen from the first film the film is poorly paced the editing is all over the place and the characters apart from the fantastic kate mckinnon have no chemistry or genuine humour in them mccartney yet again is just herself which unfortunately is just her screaming and trying to pass sarcasm as comedy and her chemistry with wig is all but nonexistent when you consider they are the main leads all in all this movie was a failure and apart from seeing the cameos in the film of the oringal cast even the head sculpture of ramis and kate mckinnon i hope sony dont decided to go down a sequel path
Jul 18 2016,positive,im just going to keep it simple this film was fabulously good impressed of how much i enjoy it  paul feig can have the name of the man thats bringing the message that is ok to have a female focus movie  this film did play it safe and you will know what i mean when you see it but i would say this much this will be one of the first movies i would show my daughter telling her  see baby you can do whatever you like and kick ass
Jul 18 2016,positive,this movie was good beginning to end  it had me laughing out loud
Jul 18 2016,negative,first off i want to point out that despite hearing very mixed reviews about the film i went in with a completely open mind unfortunately in this particular circumstance it made no difference   the film falls flat straight off the mark for me due to the lack of intelligent and engaging humour and organic situational laughs there are a couple of humours moments throughout the film where i laughed out loud the characters have no real chemistry it just feels forced and ingenuine personally i found them uneven and likable however in saying that i have to give praise to chris hemsworth and kate mckinnon as they were the standouts   despite being massively unrealistic or believable characters they were the only genuine fun element of the whole entire film they seemed to come into their own primarily by being the only two people who wanted to be there not because of their contractual obligations and was actually enjoying themselves and were making the most of it   the bad bits of this film heavily outweigh the good the inevitable cameo scenes i felt that only two of these worked well and flowed within the film but the rest were painfully forced and unnecessary   all this aside i feel i could have enjoyed the film and over looked the majority of continuing issues however this just wasnt possible due to my biggest gripe with the whole entire film the bloody horrific storyline and pathetic villain   it is so mind blowingly awful its offensive and not in any form of fun way either it is flat out disgraceful that this was the final draft i came out of this film feeling sad and severely disappointed and from the reaction from the majority of the other cinema goers in my screening i wasnt the only one     i honestly cant recommend this film as i feel it isnt fun nor is it particularly funny you will not gain anything from this film
Jul 18 2016,positive,i loved it i thought it was hilarious people are comparing this movie to the original expect nothing watch it as a stand alone comedy and have a good time otherwise sit alone and cry that the good old days are gone kate mckinnon is the reason this movie rocks
Jul 18 2016,positive,this is not a remake it is an independent outake based on the ghostbusters movie plots are different each one stands on its own if you are expecting a remake of the original you can give up  it was a nice surprise its entertaining and way better than i was expecting based on the trailer
Jul 18 2016,positive,great movie plenty of laughs great action the 3d effects were excellent loved the entire cast  dont believe all the crap reviews this movie has gotten its just an outpouring of hate from the same people that hated on the trailers for the past year theyre likely all trump supporters based on how they regard women  highly recommend it
Jul 18 2016,positive,i had very low expectations for this movie and was pleasantly surprised i thought chris hemsworth was very funnyfunnier than any of the women it was enjoyable to watch
Jul 18 2016,negative,this is like female version of adam sandler movies
Jul 18 2016,positive,the snl girls take on ghostbusters with similar humor to paul feigs other films like spy love kate mckinnon and wish she was in more movies
Jul 18 2016,negative,if you want some great laughs go watch the original if you like cg and failed attempts at humor knock yourself out with ghostbusters 2016
Jul 18 2016,negative,it is a shame see how much money sony has spent doing lobby for this movie and at critics to them give a high rating as 73 but one thing is good from now on to know if a critic is a sellout you will just need to check if heshe approved the movie here at rottentomatoes and then disconsider anything heshe publishpublishedwill publish about any other movie because heshe doesnt do reviews based on his opinion but instead the opinion that studios want to himher to have
Jul 18 2016,positive,ghost buster is funny and fun to watch 
Jul 18 2016,positive,an amazing mix of funny and scary that still manages to stay within mostly child friendly parameters so that if not the whole family at least a fair chunk can go and enjoy it has a few fun homages to the originals but completely stands on its own so you wont know what to expect going in it would be a great outing for the whole family to go and see this i plan on seeing it again in theaters soon
Jul 18 2016,negative,terrible movie and totally ruined the ghostbusters vibe just a silly dump and unfunny movie with childish cgi shouldve stuck to the original formula and continued the story of the kids of the old ghostbusters epic fail
Jul 18 2016,positive,it was fun some of the jokes miss the mark but plenty hit it
Jul 18 2016,negative,really poorly written and directed unoriginal and sadly unfunny so much couldve been done with this film but that potential was absolutely squandered its like they tapped the worst snl writers to pen their most hackneyed script unlike the original films which were imbued with so much detail character and heart that they have endured 30 years of continued viewing and are thus deservedly classics i honestly dont think anyone will remember this film 2 months from now the nowinfamous hemsworth dance scene which paul feig cut but you can see portions of in the end credits was undoubtedly the funniest and funnest part of the film and it was cut verdict do yourself the favor and fast forward to you a couple months from now forget this film exists because it is nothing if not forgettable
Jul 18 2016,positive,amazing movie all around really funny so glad i got to see it
Jul 18 2016,positive,against all the odds ghostbusters 2016 is a worthy addition to the ghostbusters family although it may not have the gentle humour and surprises of the original it does have its own infectious anarchic energy the cast are uniformly good especially the barking mad kate mckinnon and it is nice to see cameos from pretty much all the old surviving cast members if you are already vehemently opposed to any form of reboot then this movie is unlikely to change your mind if however you are willing to forgive the audacity of the filmmakers for rebooting such a much loved classic then you might just have a great time
Jul 18 2016,positive,worth going to see in the theater  its its own story but has nice shout outs to the original
Jul 18 2016,positive,it made me laugh the cast of characters were interesting and it followed an enjoyable standout story sure it wasnt perfect and i wasnt blown away by it but there were plenty of notable things from this movie that i was particularly impressed by it proves itself to being independent from the originals and i say that they can exist alongside one another very well this iteration is definitely fitted more for the current younger generation think todays snl but it doesnt lose its merit solely for that in my opinion
Jul 18 2016,negative,it was like being lectured about social justice for two hours
Jul 18 2016,positive,honestly i liked this one significantly more than the original i cant remember the last time i laughed this hard all the way through a movie
Jul 18 2016,positive,saw it in 2d and that was a mistake need to see it again in 3d and maybe again in 2d after that such good special effects and acting went with a group of 11 people and even a few who had been naysayers due to reading some poor reviews had to admit that it was a solid remake that was very well done and paid homage to the original without seeming like a knockoff ladies and some gentlemen will no doubt love to stay tuned during the credits and keep an eye out for a dance number filled with eye candy one person in our group commented that the movie was worth the ticket price just to watch that part    not sure if it is due to nostalgia or not but everyone seemed to agree that while this was a good movie it didnt quite overtake the original fell just a bit short of being able to be said to be as good as the original but more that good enough to watch again a couple times
Jul 18 2016,positive,i think this is a great movie
Jul 18 2016,positive,not superior than than the original by far but still funny and enjoyable 
Jul 18 2016,positive,very worthy reboot of the franchise
Jul 18 2016,positive,saw it once and already want to see it again absolutely fantastic the entire cast was hilarious and the jokes never once fell flat one of the best movies of the year hands down
Jul 18 2016,positive,this was a solid film and one that created its own identity outside of the originals while still paying respect to them i feel as though its just the start to an amazing franchise where we can get more out of this ip then we ever did in the past my favorite part of the film was that the characters in this film were there own people not just female versions of the original cast i highly recommend the film as a solid summer blockbuster i feel as though a great number of the negative reviews from the viewers on this one are coming from people who have not seen this film and have no intention of ever seeing it due to misplaced biases to those people i say go see the film it may surprise you
Jul 18 2016,neutral,wheres rick moranis tho
Jul 18 2016,positive,great comedic writing great plot great action  i have completely forgotten about ghostbusters ii
Jul 18 2016,positive,a welcomed addition to a beloved franchise fun funny and action packed with beautiful 3d effects some running gags are hit or miss but the hits make up for the misses great soundtrack as well recommended 355
Jul 18 2016,positive,ghostbusters 2016  one of the most entertaining films i ever watched    i am relieved that this film was produced  thank you to director paul feig and the rest of the production team for creating this highly entertaining summer film     this film does not deserve the abuse and boycott it is receiving     i watched the original ghostbusters film and was shocked to see how stereotyped not to mention sexist the 1984 version is this is a funny breath of fresh air and i am relieved that  as a female audience member i did not have to endure watching a boring probably lonely male fantasize about hot phantom blowjobs nor watch beautiful sigourney weaver who is powerful in alien get turned to a helpless damsel in distress or endure listening to other stupid jokes about menstruation remember the librarian and sigourneys character with her legs open and being gatekeepernot much subtext or subtlety     so yes relieved to see that a feminist version came out because we as female consumers deserve it i can only hope that it will get better and better i am tempted to say the future is here despite you haters     the cult classic was butchered for many  particularly men  because it did not play into their male fantasies this movie has even been challenged kevin smith who goes on a ludicrous rant about the trailer when in reality other far worse trailers and movies have been made     we need more of this
Jul 18 2016,negative,i have no idea how a movie with 73 from the critics lost out on its opening weekend to secret life of pets and hasnt yet made a third of its production cost back seems the audience score of 57 is the more accurate one
Jul 18 2016,positive,i wanted to be seven again watching this seeing women in stem fields kicking ass and being funny and clever while they do it not a perfect movie some parts dragged but over all i really enjoyed it
Jul 18 2016,positive,best 2016 summer movie ever super cool in mustsee imax 3d was like the ghost were flying around the theater  super cool sound
Jul 18 2016,positive,far better than the critics are saying  it pays enough homage with cameos from all surviving members of the original cast whilst still managing to be original and to stand on its own two feet  arguably though the real stars are kate mckinnon and chris helmsworth who steal the show every time
Jul 18 2016,positive,went in to see a ghost busters movie saw a ghost busters movie i was not disappointed
Jul 18 2016,negative,very bad movie it felt like a feminist propaganda and jokes were not funny the cast was good but wasted thanks for ruining a childhood classic i am not looking forward for another one
Jul 18 2016,positive,a delightful laugh out loud worthy heir to the ghostbusters of yore
Jul 18 2016,negative,how any professional critic can justify giving this offensively bad film anything more than one star is just mind boggling ghostbusters has a paper thin story caricatures rather than actual characters and visual effects so poor youd be mistake for thinking youre watching a straighttovideo scooby doo movie    despite the cast being being billed as hilarious there are zero laughs throughout this movie and id challenge anybody to come away with a funny quotable line from the film that wasnt in the trailers we had rammed down our throats
Jul 18 2016,negative,this movie doesnt deserve to be named after the classic toilet jokes from the start male cast are  written to be extremely dumb or total aholes chris hemsworth  saves this movie from being a 1 dont waste your money on this movie which is an obviously a cash grab from sony as well as a total man bash by screen writer katie dippold and director paul feig
Jul 18 2016,positive,dont pay attention to the haters this movie rocks  people have been praying for this to fail since last year because nobody wanted a rebootand people who havent even seen this movie are giving it bad reviews just to spite it  but its awesome  super funny  and its not just a reboot its its own movie that cleverly tips its hat to the originals
Jul 18 2016,positive,i thought the trailers looked really stupid and i didnt want to see it my wife wanted to see it though because she is a big snl fan we went and i was pleasantly surprised it had me laughing out loud in parts chris hemsworth and kate mckinnon are freaking hilarious i was a bit disappointed that it doesnt in any way connect with the original movie it is truly a reboot but it really funny i would recommend to anyone who enjoys snl type humor
Jul 18 2016,neutral,pretty bad writing i chuckled only a very little bit not a very good homage to the original which was actually funny
Jul 18 2016,negative,im sorry to give such a low review this is just a remake of the original but with a spin on how we get there there is no originality here where the plot gets you excited to sum it up you saw this movie decades ago the basic premise only the characters are different im amazed they couldnt have been a bit more creative with how they brought this brand back to life maybe a passing of the baton from the old to the new may have saved this film alas this film was a disappointment because the hopes were too high and reality came in short
Jul 18 2016,positive,it was amazing im not quite sure how many people said it wasnt such a great movie when it was it was hilarious and a whole new experience i love how they included things from the older film its a great movie and id see it again
Jul 18 2016,negative,just wasnt very good to be honest  the trailer matched the tone of the film predictable cheap laughs with every character playing a complete stereotype of how they were cast  my niece loved it i guess when youre 7 everything is a riot  i want to show her the original film but i dont want to be that uncle who showed me some old movie that he loved but i couldnt care less about
Jul 17 2016,negative,misandry incarnate
Jul 17 2016,positive,we went to ghostbusters tonight and had a blast the thing to remember is that this is a reboot not a remake so instead of not going or going begrudgingly remember that this is a new twist on a classic tale but with hilarious women giving you a really fun ride
Jul 17 2016,positive,ghostbusters has incredible joke density and there are a lot of misses but its unselfserious and when it hits it hits hard the goofy horror comedy doesnt just feel like a paean to the era of the source it feels like something weve been missing since an astute eye for graphics and color push this one beyond its aspirations and the 3d work is worth seeing it may not be the best movie this summer but its almost certainly the most fun
Jul 17 2016,negative,if you judge it against the originals it doesnt deserve the name the tone of the movie is so over the top and cartoony that it feels more like scooby doo than ghostbusters the villian is not good and the 3rd act is silly in the worst kind of ways when bill murray is somehow the worst part of a ghostbusters movie then youve allowed the wrong person to make a ghostbusters movie thanks sony thanks so much feig tried to give each of the ghostbusters mtv style slow motion fighting scenes at the end out of nowhere and it doesnt work at all it felt like a fan film of the old real ghostbusters cartoon    if you look at it as a paul feig movie this would be the worst of his recent string of films spy worked as a spoof this feels like a spoof as well thats a shitty approach to the material and it makes a supremely inferior movie its plot has gigantic holes in it that you could drive a bus through the movie just barely holds together but aside from mckinnons quirky performance this is a completely unmemorable effort    save your money and watch this turkey when they release it on video
Jul 17 2016,positive,some mild spoilers you are warned    i thought the movie was pretty damn good certainly far better than i expected based on the trailers on a side note sony should fire whoever cut those trailers they were awful and did a terrible job of representing the movie    they managed to hit some of the same notes and put in references back to the originals while still making the movie their own i agree with some of the other reviews out there that some of the cameos of the original cast could have been done better although i still feel like they should have set it in the same universe as the original and had them reprise their original roles but ill get back to that but allinall it was a good movie    something i thought they did especially well was the ghosts i thought they felt legitimately threatening and creepy while looking pretty amazing the ghostbusters were put into true danger by the ghosts on multiple occasions and not just by the big bad of the movie which made the stakes of the ghosts needing to be caught feel a bit more real there is a largescale battle towards the end where they have to fight through a sea of ghosts that i thought was particularly impressive the team felt suitably badass as they broke out some new equipment and just tore the ghosts apart    the one plot point i thought felt a little contrived was the government intervention probably as an homage to walter peck from the original the government tries to shut them down but this time they know the ghosts are real and just dont want the public to panic so they try to discredit the ghostbusters and make everyone think theyre frauds rather than trying to suppress them it would make much more sense for the government to hire them to research the ghosts the ghostbusters have the only means of combating the supernatural so if you know that paranormal phenomena are a real threat why make their jobs harder    this brings me back around to the connection or lack thereof to the original there are a few points where it felt like they had filmed bits so they could have the possibility of connecting to the original universe but then decided not to first theres the cameos which with some name changes and minor tweaks to the lines could have totally been the original characters with the exception of sigourney weaver her cameo was too different from her original character and would have had to be totally rewritten then the government people make vague reference to the public having found out before and forgotten about ghosts the aftercredits scene makes a further reference back to the original movie as a setup for a sequel    as far as the actors go kate mckinnon totally steals the show she has by far the funniest character with some of the best lines kristen wiig and melissa mccarthy play off each other well as longtime friends who had a falling out going in i was most concerned about leslie jones character based on the trailers but it turns out those scenes which i still wasnt a huge fan of but were better in context were the only ones like that in the movie also chris hemsworth was far funnier than i could have anticipated who knew he could play a big dumb clueless prettyboy    so overall i liked the movie is it as good as the original no but then the original is so close to perfect that if thats your standard this movie would be doomed before it ever started production what it is is a good summer film with good action good laughs and just enough homage to make me happy i wish they had made it a continuation instead of a reboot but as reboots go they could have done a lot worse
Jul 17 2016,positive,this was a delightful movie destroyed only by the cynicism of the audience including fans of the original and those against the idea of a feminist reboot of ghostbusters however this movie proved to be so much more
Jul 17 2016,negative,with all due respect to the actresses and no preconceptions worst movie of the year this film was horrible and really sucks special effects were ok but just boring as all hell
Jul 17 2016,positive,enjoyed it had scary and laugh out loud moments with a few sluggish ones too but overall lots of fun and enjoyed watching the chemistry of the ladies and chris hemsworth was funny kids and adults can enjoy it together they could have left out some of the nostalgic bits and cameos completely and gone out its own    i recently watched the original again like all things from your youth it seemed bigger and better in memory viewing it again 30 years later with adult lenses the original wasnt really that funny and doesnt really stand the test of time like other 80s classics home alone or et so i dont really know why the internet got so worried with the reboot hollywood should stop rebooting 80s movies or doing multiple sequels thus killing original ideas and find some new stories to tell and entertain newer generations its fun to be nostalgic but some things are better left in the past like fond memories
Jul 17 2016,positive,the crowd applauded spontaneously laughed loudly and cheered when beloved franchise favorites popped on screen all four chicks are hilarious in their own right but kate mckinnon takes the cake with her delightfully unhinged holtzmann  what a thrill to see something so smart so hilarious and so timely with four women and a kickass director at the helm
Jul 17 2016,negative,all that talent should have been way funnier little disappointing
Jul 17 2016,negative,most of the jokes in this movie fell flat in the theatre i watched it in
Jul 17 2016,positive,ghostbusters was hilarious and exciting i loved every minute of it
Jul 17 2016,positive,pretty good than expected fun love chris hemsworths performance id say better than the original one
Jul 17 2016,negative,nope wasnt funny poorly written complete garbage  nothing against the 4 main characters   i still think there funny  but not in this movie  should be redone with the same cast but under different direction  both in the comedy and the general story itself   one that actually makes sense
Jul 17 2016,positive,we really enjoyed watching  story was different and fresh  loved all the cameos
Jul 17 2016,positive,this movie was so good it shattered so many barriers the graphics were awesome it was so funny and i would totally watch it again and again i was so giddy during the whole thing also the fact that kate mckinnon was in it was so great because she is so so so so attractive and im going to marry her someday or ill die
Jul 17 2016,positive,impossible to live up to the expectations but generally amusing and with some funny blasts from the past could have been better if it was more raunchy and catered to an adult crowd instead of being a people pleaser overall a bit disappointed but still enjoyed it
Jul 17 2016,positive,absolutely loved this hysterical my favorites being patti holtzman and kevin really fun and i loved the integration of the old ghostbusters with the new
Jul 17 2016,positive,loved itit was funny  stayed true to what youd expect from a  ghostbusters movie but was still original  my boys enjoyed it
Jul 17 2016,negative,absolutely horrible
Jul 17 2016,negative,great 1st act and then it all falls apart  cringe worthy cameos no real plot or a character development and it cant decide if it wants to copy the original or be its own movie  there was so much potential with this cast and none of the magic or chemistry from feigs previous films finds it way into this
Jul 17 2016,negative,so if you see this movie   expect it to be like seeing a kiss cover band  where they sing songs from journey  and set off thousands of roman candles and pretty sparklers  and occasionally actual members from kiss come on stage as roadies    i was really hopeful i came at this movie like you might come at seeing a kiss cover band you know it isnt the original but thats ok it is a group of people who are paying homage through imitation and creative license    this could be good   heck this could be great  it could be the start of a wonderful franchise    my 15 year old daughter summed it up pretty well  it seemed like a fan fiction film from some college art school like on youtube    the fact is that the four comedian actresses they cast are great in their own right i was pretty convinced of that before the movie and from some of their other roles and they did an admirable job in this movie the premise was actually good but the writing kinda sucked the flow of the movie was choppy the use of special effects was so over the top it seemed unreal any suspense nope think less suspenseful paranormal and more casper or haunted mansion at disneyland    but despite all of that the one person who really saved this movie was kate mckinnon who played holtzmann  the best lines  the best enthusiasm  the most fun character  she actually made me laugh  if you could condense this movie down to being just about her i would put it on repeat    at the end of the day  i still liked this movie only slightly more than ghostbusters 2
Jul 17 2016,neutral,better than expected but still not great mediocre movie that doesnt know what it wants to be tone shifts everywhere some jokes hit well a lot miss wait for rental or online
Jul 17 2016,positive,i had so much fun watching this movie kate mckinnon is a gift i cant wait to see it again
Jul 17 2016,positive,full disclosure i was an uncredited extra in the concert scene but ill have to watch it on freezeframe to see if i actually show up so while being an extra was fun it gives me no personal investment in how the movie does ok with that out of the way  i loved this ghostbusters so much more than i expected to i didnt expect it to be horrible certainly not the blight on everyones childhood that certain people declared it would be but i also didnt expect it to be more than alright because reboots are rarely more than alright i was very pleasantly surprised  things i loved about it include but are not limited to  1 the cast the main four have amazing chemistry plus great improv skills that really show in their performances it seems this left some people cold but to me the offthecuff style of a lot of the dialogue made the characters come across more like people interacting and playing off of one another naturally as naturally as overthetop characters like holtzmann should anyway than like actors doing a script also you can see this is so much more fun than playing thor going off in neon lights in chris hemsworths head every time he does anything which is delightful also also it was fun to see some great character actors like karan soni and neil casey get more time to shine   2 the characters i get why the first time people saw holtzmanns hair they became concerned that they were looking at an egon carbon copy but nothing could be further from the truth each character was distinct from one another and from their counterparts in the original well performed and brought something to both the team and to the movie   before i move on i want to give some particular appreciation to holtzmann and to kate mckinnons performance of her not because i like holtz more than the other characters per se in fact i think i can honestly say i liked them all moreorless equally on their own merits but because she stands out on a sort of meta level that i think is worth discussing to the extent that she fits an archetype at all shes an archetype you never see in a female character and that was really nice she has an eccentric enthusiasm that borders on sexuality which mckinnon owns in a way that would never happen for a clone of buttoneddown egon and plays like the personality lovechild of bill murray and bobcat goldwaithe yeah think about that for a second and while its not uncommon to see female characters with any two of confidence competence and eccentricity you rarely get all three especially not turned up to 11 unless maybe shes someones manic pixie dream girl   jillian holtzmann manic pixie dream girl of herself and science  skip this paragraph to avoid two small spoilers but the thing that really made me like character and particularly mckinnons portrayal of her for me was the first of exactly two moments in the whole movie where holtzmans facade drops when her equipment is threatened which shows that it is in fact a facade which adds a layer of depth to her that i dont think any character in ghostbusters has ever had i also cant write about my appreciation without mentioning her stone cold badass sequence with the dual proton pistols in a lot of ways its a pretty standard stone cold badass sequence slomo ripping into cg baddies etc but the whole thing is shot and choreographed really well doesnt go on too long and mckinnon dives into it with this gleeful things are weird as hell and weird as hell is my element vibe that i just cant fathom someone not digging that   3 a surprising amount of deadpan humor i think to really get the most out of this movie you have to appreciate a certain kind of very britishfeeling humor that doesnt hang a sign on every joke which to me just makes them funnier in retrospect the opening scene does a brilliant job of setting that tone for the rest of the movie in this regard if you want to avoid a minor spoiler for that scene skip to the next paragraph imagine a tour guide leading people through a creepy house he tells the people sounding dead serious that this was once one of the most luxurious homes in new york with such luxuries as a face bidet and antiirish security fence and that it was in this room right here that wealthy visitor pt barnum first had the idea to enslave elephants   did you crack a smile at that if so then theres a whole extra layer of humor beneath the more obvious jokes and pretty lights that may delight you if not then theres still a fun movie with more obvious jokes but to me it was these subtle collisions of serious delivery and slightly absurd content that made for some of the most pleasant surprises    there were other things i loved like some of the cameos and things i thought were ok  like some of the cameos and things that left me a bit cold but were ultimately shrugworthy like some of the cameos but this wouldnt be a fair review if i didnt also talk about some of the things i really wish were different so   1 it didnt need to be a reboot they had all of the surviving original cast there for cameos would it have been so hard to have a backstory where the nowold and in one case heartbreakingly dead originals passed the torch off to the next generation or to a new franchise in another city which then gets conveniently cut off by ghostpacalypse etc i appreciate that they put effort into giving erin and abby backstories that explain why they got into the supernatural in the first place more than i think we get for any of the originals now that i think of it but maybe im forgetting something and that those backstories wouldnt fit well with a world where ghostbusting is already a thing but i think the original deserves a successor more than it does a redo and this could have been a worthy successor  2 patty was hrmmm this gets complicated a lot of people many of them white folks like myself have complained that the one black main character well acts too black to which leslie jones has shot back something to the effect of f you i am black dont tell me its offensive for me to be like myself which makes sense and yet and yet yeah gotta say although i appreciate that they took the effort to make her a legit encyclopedic nyc history nerd instead of just being generically streetwise aka dances with minorities the character and jones portrayal still read as uncomfortably stereotypical to me that said the power of patty compels you remains one of my favorite bits   3 too many lampshades yeah ok so not all of the jokes let alone all of the cultural subtext was as subtle as the deadpan humor i talked about before minor spoiler coming next they defeat a male antagonist ghost by literally shooting him in the crotch which apparently hurts even in genitalfree hulking astral form now if i was this movie given all the crap and vitriol that got thrown at it just for existing before the internet had seen so much as a picture frankly i might want to metaphorically shoot something in the balls too but still both comedically and in terms of ok but seriously it has no genitals at all it was pretty dumb imo and its not the only joke that seemed uncharacteristically immature cf a fart joke early on that was way less funny to me than the movie seemed to think it should have been and some of the references to the original were a bit sometimes more than a bit too eh eeeh see what we did there  its also a fair cop that every male character in the movie is an idiot a jerk or both but then when was the last time there was a complaint to be had about the breadth of male representation in a major comedyaction film now how about female representation look i dearly hope that someday we reach a point where the breadth of female representation in this film is enough of a norm that the absence of male characters that dont just exist in service to the development of female characters can be one of those things we look back on as a product of its time but while we still have movies that struggle to clear that lowest of bars the friggin bechdel test excuse me if i dont get too worked up over this   there are other things i could complain about like the extent of holtzmanns technical wunderkinding and a few physics headscratchers that stretch credibility even by ghostbuster standards but on the whole i thought this was a really great movie the kind i wouldnt mind seeing again which is pretty rare for me   forget the haters i hope history bears this one out as something worthy of a place on the shelf right next to the original ghostbusters possibly cleverly obscuring ghostbusters ii
Jul 17 2016,positive,very entertaining and enjoyed the remake or adaptation was impressed and really enjoyed
Jul 17 2016,positive,really funny great chemistry between actresses mckinnon kills it solid action jokes and visuals i loved it
Jul 17 2016,negative,the movie is not as horrible as the trailer made it out to be  but honestly its only ok  i should of waited to see it on cable
Jul 17 2016,negative,a number of talented people undermined by mediocre writing with two dimensional characters terrible jokes hit and miss effects a horrible villain and shitty treatment of its male characters especially chris hemsworth character who made a mistake getting involved with this movie
Jul 17 2016,neutral,the 3rd act is a mess however until that point it movie was pretty decent
Jul 17 2016,positive,loved it while it was not completely perfect it was a far more successful remake then most end up being i laughed all throughout the film and all the nostalgic nods to the original were full of the feels it was an original take on the action comedy genre that left me hoping for more to come
Jul 17 2016,positive,its ghostbusters not gone with the wind lol some people are sooo serious relax and enjoy the cast is great my friend and i thought it was really fun we had steady laughs and looking at chris hemsworth was bad either it doesnt take itself to seriously which was just what i needed this week
Jul 17 2016,positive,hilarious just as fun and exciting as the original with some good old melissa mccarthy and kristen wiig charm lots of good poop jokes im a writer serious film goer and would absolutely recommend seeing this film
Jul 17 2016,negative,i read melissa mccarthy broke 7 toilet seats during the filming ghostbusters
Jul 17 2016,positive,ghostbusters attempted to shut down the haters and fans of the original but seemed to fall short with cgi that is beautifully mesmerising the story sadly is a cluttered mess with scenes that are unnecessarily long and too short it leaves you uncomfortable knowing the fact that it just doesnt feel right it had a specific cameo that was good while it lasted but dragged on to be a waste of time and money the film had jokes that hit the mark and some that didnt that turned out to be cringworthy the character development of few were awful denying you to have a connection to them making them less relatable overall it was an enjoyable film but one that i would never have to or want to see again
Jul 17 2016,positive,although the pacing was a bit uneven and the story was similar to the original the new ghostbusters nailed the laughs had nicely done cameos and most importantly kept in the spirit of the originals the youtube haters definitely missed out on this one
Jul 17 2016,positive,laughed out loud more than once
Jul 17 2016,positive,good movie they did a good job making it there own movie
Jul 17 2016,positive,not even going to qualify this so hate if you are going to the new ghostbusters movie is awesome totally fun and entertaining everything that made the original movie a hit not perfect but i would definitely watch it again
Jul 17 2016,negative,these movie sucks do a favor to your wallet and dont watch these movie
Jul 17 2016,positive,i wasnt a huge fan of the original movie maybe because i didnt grow up with it so the franchise didnt have the nostalgia factor for me so going into this movie i had my doubts but i was pleasantly surprised i really enjoyed all of the characters the interpersonal interactions and the cheesy humor its a great summer night movie
Jul 17 2016,negative,cheesy attempt at a remake  there were some laughs but that is it
Jul 17 2016,positive,now that the movie is out im not sure why all the hate it was a really enjoyable movie wasnt that interested in seeing it but they did a good job with it imho
Jul 17 2016,positive,i had a blast at this movie fun funny great characters the visuals and great sound effects make this a movie you need to see in the theater terrific movie for kids five cameos from the original stars and a dedication to harold ramis respectful and true to the original spirit im going to see it again stay until the very end of the credits or youll miss out
Jul 17 2016,positive,loved it this movie is absolutely hilarious from start to finish without all the gross dude jokes dont get me wrong there are a few wellplaced fart jokes and some classic one liners but without the sleazy bill murray presence all and all it flows exactly how youd think it would with a cast of smart funny strange women
Jul 17 2016,positive,fantastic  hilarious  proves women can be funny and have every right to take on a classic like ghostbusters
Jul 17 2016,negative,ghostbusters 2016 is an unfortunate babyboomer joke on this generation this remake had the opportunity to take a universally loved cultural cinema theme and create an inclusive next chapter in the saga of humanitys drive to conquer the afterlife where women could pick up the torch and be just as iconic relateable and memorable as the ghostbusting heroes    instead ghosbusters slaps a popular franchise name onto 1 hour and 57 minutes of unfunny hastily slappedtogether scenes mostly comprised of cramming every boringly overplayed sexist stereotype and mockery about women possible into the dialogue the characters went unexplored and remained these wooden twodimensional effigies of what a 12yearold using reddit thinks women are exaggerated to the point that the audience had little reason to identify or invest in them the cameos were hamhanded and pointless as if these hollywood legends showed up unannounced on set and wanted to vamp vaudeville style for 20 minutes and the director agreed to include their slapdash scene in the final cut out of misguided loyalty to these actors cult of personalities    the plot hobbled along between overly drawn out and irritatingly irrelevant conversation points characters were dropped in for convenience with zero subtlety or context and the antagonist was so stupifyingly lackluster that even his death and defeat werent interesting or memorable    the climax fizzled in the movies hurry to get itself over with the effects were gratuitous and contributed nothing the protagonist characters were 4 sides of the same chauvinists mary sued boxedup indictment of modern independent womanhood and can someone please tell me why the hell they stuck a female slimer dressed like a 1950s sockhopper in the car to make out with original slimer    this movie could have been really great but instead it just seems like hollywood bowed to the internet fanboy tantrums and hobbled this horse right out of the gate at every turn the writing and directing choices sought to resurrect and reinforce the sexist idea that action movies cant be funny or engaging with female leads and i am really disappointed and disheartened by this treatment of one of my favorite franchises    the popcorn was pretty good though
Jul 17 2016,positive,although  the plot is quite predictable  i enjoyed the movie
Jul 17 2016,negative,painfully unfunny  original ghostbuster movie was so much better  this was a pointless remake if it aint broke dont fix it
Jul 17 2016,positive,ghostbusters was so good and funny and awesome  kate mckinnon is my new girl crush  
Jul 17 2016,positive,loved it lots of laughs kate mckinnon was hilarious
Jul 17 2016,positive,found the movie light and very enjoyable  may go see it again
Jul 17 2016,positive,i saw this movie on saturday july 16th  it was well done  not earthshattering with new ideas but it had a decent storyline  it was respectful of the originals and the cameos were great  the laughs were almost nonstop and kate mckinnon
Jul 17 2016,positive,pleasantly surprised with how much i loved this movie fresh new plot incredibly funny women and awesome fight scenes what more can a gal ask for
Jul 17 2016,positive,paul feig the director of previous melissa mccarthy hits like bridesmaids the heat and spy brings us ghostbusters a reboot of an 80s classic that does an outstanding job as a standalone film yet not as good when compared to the original nonetheless this movie contains some dazzling special effects and a lot of funny scenes even if the comedy feels a bit more familyfriendly than it did in other movies of feigs overall i honestly recommend this movie for anyone looking to have a fun time at the movies dont believe the negative hype
Jul 17 2016,positive,fighting level3 apparitions and the patriarchy
Jul 17 2016,positive,ghostbusters 2016 review   jacob smith      like a ghoul rising from the dark recesses of the past for yet another scare the new ghostbusters film is the latest in a line of reboots emanating from the seemingly shallow grave of hollywood creativity the teaser trailer was met with moans of sarcasm and groans of disbelief over major changes in the story to both characters and special effects  did this initial vapid response hold its ground or did it run away screaming paving the way for a successful flick that managed to not only leave its own mark in the ghostbusters franchise but pay homage to the classics before    like most of entertainment today in 2016 everything seems to be reaching for inspiration in the nostalgic bags labeled 80s and 90s the xfiles full house jurassic park pokemon ninja turtles and even certain gameshows all of these things have returned in one form or another in the past couple of years all of them being judged quite heavily by those that came before them this can be a problem as writers much make sure that they walk the fine line far enough without deviating from the path too much or youll turn the old fans into rabid dogs playing it too safe is just as bad as not only will you fail to leave your own mark you will most certainly be forgotten in the tide of more original titles    as for this film ghostbusters is a film with much needed fresh faces fresh storytelling with many respectable nods to its past  while the plot takes place in an original world in which the other films never took place there are plenty of nudges both in terms of audio queues and visuals that manage to wrap fans in that nice warm blanket of nostalgia while keeping them guessing as to what will come next    the fresh cast comprised of kristen wiig melissa mccarthy kate mckinnon and leslie jones compliment each other really well in their acting dynamics and remain whollyindependent avoiding ever acting as mere clones of the original cast  speaking of the original cast  all of them have cameos minus two  bill murray dan aykroyd and ernie hudson of the original ghostbusting team all have cameo roles as do sigourney weaver and annie potts  the only two truly missing are harold ramis who sadly passed away in february 2014 and rick moranis who told the hollywood reporter he simply didnt feel it was worth his time to do one day of shooting on something he did over 30 years ago  quite possibly the most hilarious addition to the cast is the male secretary role played by chris hemsworth from the moment you meet the character of kevin i was laughing my ass off as he plays nothing more than a strong simpleton with all brawn and no brains  wonderful choice of cast    the special effects are something that force people to take sides these days when it comes to film  cgi and other computerenhanced special effects are rampant and nearly a dime a dozen in todays cinema landscape as for an individual who watched the original two ghostbusters films the evening before i went to see the new one i can say the new cgi doesnt take away from the old at all  in fact the special effects while looking fake  i mean come on its a damn ghost after all  are without question leaps and bounds better than the fuzzy blurry graphical overlays used in originals dont get hung up on the graphics enjoy them    the overall plot as a whole is nothing unheard of but it is indeed a plot that feels more explored and defined than those in the originals  it simply feels like more happens in this movie than the first two combined  a drastically bigger variety of settings and landscapes compared to the simple buffet hall apartment building firehouse and art gallery from the originals the world is much more alive and for a series that has laid dormant since 1989 this is very much a great thing      910 a dreadfully fun ghoulish romp through freshlyfamiliar territory with new faces coupled with an injection of creativity seen through a more modern lens  i loved it      after credits  make sure you stay all the way through the credits to the very end there is a aftercredit scene that will make fans of the original not only squeal with delight but also wonder if a sequel to this newly reinvigorated franchise is right around the corner
Jul 17 2016,positive,once you get past the hating this movie simply for existing you will find a fun movie with a likeable cast that has plenty of laughs and is completely harmless to the franchise unlike ghostbusters 2 lol
Jul 17 2016,positive,still a hysterical movie to add to the summer of 2016
Jul 17 2016,negative,what garbage dont waste your money on this junk and poor excuse of a movie
Jul 17 2016,negative,it was just sad  i wish the writing and the acting was better  why couldnt they just make a new movie about ladies fighting ghosts rather than try to tack this horrible pile to a successful franchise successful because there were only two moviesit didnt need a third or a reboot  this is just another throwaway comedy that will in no way be remembered or celebrated as the original
Jul 17 2016,negative,all that nonsexist hate justified full review 
Jul 17 2016,positive,this movie was awesome just went to see it with my partner and we loved it its hilarious and action filled and for once the women are treated like actual human beings with brains
Jul 17 2016,positive,im sorry but why is the audience score only 57 at the time of me writing this review  this movie was smart in its construction entertaining funny as hell all four actresses and hemsworth know their craft and it has the blessing from 5 of the original movies actors and you cant tell me bill murray and sigourney weaver were only in it for the money  theyre not exactly hurting for cash
Jul 17 2016,positive,ghostbusters is back but its been 27 years since the second film so instead of a long distance sequel like tron legacy and star wars the force awakens we get a reboot instead the cast is game the film is decent the cameos are not i would have also preferred a sequel with more involvement from the original cast but apparently thats not possible because of bill murray the movie was enjoyable and i found myself laughing really hard at least two times and its a decent well spirited reboot if not perfect
Jul 17 2016,positive,it may never live up to the original classic but this remake rises nonetheless on the strenght of its female cast and its breathtaking special effects
Jul 17 2016,positive,got me laughing frequently which is what i wanted from it
Jul 17 2016,positive,this movie was amazing the way they tied the original story into it and had the older characters in it was awesome
Jul 17 2016,negative,long story short dont waste your money
Jul 17 2016,positive,i terrific reboot that comes from a great love of the original with loads of funny references and cameos that had the audience in the theater clapping and cheering but it can also stand on its own as a fun adventurecomedy with great characters especially kate mckinnons scenestealing holtzmann great special effects and smart humor
Jul 17 2016,positive,solid summer popcorn flick with plenty of laughs  they did a good job of paying homage to the original while coming up with their own take on the story and lead characters
Jul 17 2016,positive,tbh i found it far more enjoyable them the original but loved the throwbacks to the classic
Jul 17 2016,negative,horrible not funny
Jul 17 2016,positive,whole family loves it
Jul 17 2016,positive,fun and enjoyable addition to the ghostbusters franchise i wasnt expecting it to be close to the original and honestly no new ghostbusters ever could touch the classic however it was a decently solid movie     i like many would have preferred something in continuity to the originals as well as the mythology created by the cartoons and comics in addition they seemed to modify the way ghosts work both cartoon and idw comics make clear ghosts cannot be destroyed but must be captured the final battle was more typical of a combat flick than traditional ghostbusters but this is a reboot and so may just be changing the mechanics im also not as much a fan of the new equipment but these two are related to personal preference    as to the movie it was humorous with mckinnon definitely stealing the show mileage seems to vary on hemsworths character but i found it funny id also have to say i really liked the main villain and the mad scientist persona i found myself generally engaged with the story it wasnt deep but it was coherent and written well enough to be fun    i think it has room for improvement and hope any that follow are able to build on what was done well and improve other aspects
Jul 17 2016,positive,hilariously funny update to the original movie loved the cameos by the original cast stay through the credits for thor dancing
Jul 17 2016,positive,i like the movie it was funny
Jul 17 2016,negative,comedy level minion memes
Jul 17 2016,positive,a good movie with lots of laughs and great special effects dont let people talk you out of seeing g it it is totally worth it
Jul 17 2016,positive,it was fun a lot better than i expected the ensemble comedy came together well and the plot was solid and interesting ive seen my share of lazy piece of shit reboots this is not one of them and by acknowledging and embracing the fact that it will never escape the shadow of the original it actually came out on top with a genuinely good movie
Jul 17 2016,positive,this movie is the best all the ladies kill it but kate mckinnon especially better than the original by far funnier more heartfelt and obviously the effects are superior go see it totally worth it
Jul 17 2016,negative,what a fking pile
Jul 17 2016,positive,holarious movie with constant laughs the characters are all enjoyable and the actresses pull off each of their characters brilliantly shoutouts to the classic movies are seen throughout
Jul 17 2016,positive,awesome fun a rejuvinated take on the film that makes me now want to rewatch all the prior films the effects were a real treat to see and really benefitted the gooey and overthetop ghosts reminiscent of the original films
Jul 17 2016,positive,it wasnt as tightly plotted as the original but then we actually got some character development and no one had to be sleazy  adoring it  cant wait for a sequel
Jul 17 2016,positive,this movie was soooo funny i havent laughed this much in a movie in a long time
Jul 17 2016,positive,i thought it was funny scary action packed kept me interested and better than critics where saying i really enjoyed it
Jul 17 2016,positive,funny as hell highly recommended kate mckinnon and chris hemsworth are hilarious loved it
Jul 17 2016,positive,i am going to review not based solely on the extreme predisposition of the audience but instead on the moviegoing experience the movie may have lacked the gutbusting laughs the audience anticipated but i considered the movie to be humorous in another respect to the references of these predispositions in the movie overall it is witty in its own respect and the cast did a superb job mimicking its first predecessor
Jul 17 2016,positive,as a stand alone movie these paul feig reboot was actually really good  lots of good humorous moments good character development and a mostly original story line  every major actor from the 84 movie also made appearances even harold ramis in a way      if you try and compare it to the original youll probably be disappointed  this movie honestly stands on its own two feet  if you didnt see any of the originals you wont be lost in watching the new one
Jul 17 2016,negative,what a disaster  the story is horrible and the jokes are not funny  i am pretty sure they attempted jokes but maybe not  save your money and watch a bad skit at the end of snl over and over for 90 minutes  no honest critic could like this movie
Jul 17 2016,positive,funny as hell and the cast was just perfect a movie i can watch over and over again and id still laugh out loud
Jul 17 2016,positive,ignore the hate this movie was pretty fucking funny
Jul 17 2016,positive,an endearing cast and a lot of fun to watch people keep comparing it to the original which seems ridiculous to me its more like a love letter to the franchise while also managing to be its own goofy creation if you go expecting to be disappointed you probably will be because thats kind of how our brains work if you go expecting to have a good time and dont take a summer blockbuster comedy too seriously im pretty confident youll enjoy yourself as much as the entire theater i watched it with enjoyed themselves which was a lot
Jul 17 2016,negative,this movie sucksi the story was weak jokes were few and far between and it does not acknowledge that a previous ghostbusters ever existed
Jul 17 2016,negative,this felt like a horrific cash grab with a lot of focus group tested jokes bolted on for good measure     honestly if youre 9 years old im sure this is wildly entertaining but in a world in which pixar has demonstrated that its possible to make a kids movie that appeals to adults this thing misses the mark by a wide margin    the jokes arent funny the characters are onedimensional tropes that have all been done before in a more competent fashion the premise is just a clumsy retelling of the original ghostbusters and the cgi basically turns this movie into a ridiculous cartoon at about the hour mark    ghostbusters is a dumpster fire avoid it and watch something thats scary or funny or a bit of both there are so many good ways to spend a couple of hours dont waste it on this steaming hot garbage
Jul 17 2016,positive,i dont understand all of the negative reviews  this is a scifi comedy as the original was  this reboot does rely more on special effects and less on the story drama vs the original  everyone complaining about the feminism needs to lighten up its a comedy people
Jul 17 2016,positive,good laughs awesome cast acting and definitely not as bad as the trailer seemed solid paul feig comedy and also wouldnt mind seeing a sequel
Jul 17 2016,positive,its okay it does feel like there were a few missed opportunities though     lets start with the good the film starts out rather promisingly the opening scene does contain a few good laughs though they can be a tad subtle kirstin wiig and melissa mccarthy are great they play off each other incredibly well chris hemsworth deserves his own paragraph so more on him later    now the bad the laughs are few and far between which is a shame because there are some genuinely funny moments just not enough of them as mentioned the opening scene is pretty good the funniest scene in the movie is probably the death metal concert scene this has some absolutely hilarious moments the accusations of stereotyping with leslie jones character have some merit but the most surprising victim of stereotypes is kate mckinnon     isnt mckinnon supposed to be the one bright spot of snl nowadays why does she get the weakest role of the main four shes basically insane genius and nothing more than that the other three ladies got some development mckinnon gets none its not her fault though shes just not given good material to work with    on the other hand the scene stealer is definitely thor himself chris hemsworth as the dumb as bricks secretary hemsworth is an absolute delight every scene he gets is funny though the film does miss one huge golden opportunity when he gets possessed by a ghost and is given the powers to make all of nyc dance at his command this is saved for during the credits but it would have been hilarious in the actual movie      theres a lot of winks and nods to the 1984 movie bill murray dan aykroyd ernie hudson and sigourney weaver all make cameos but as a standalone film its not terrible its entertaining but they definitely could have gotten more out of this than they did
Jul 17 2016,positive,it is too bad so many people made their mind up about this movie before they even saw it they cheated themselves out of a good movie
Jul 17 2016,negative,this movie had more in common with a adam sandlers pixels epic movie or the scooby doo films than ghostbusters not a single joke in the movie and an awful thrown together plot
Jul 17 2016,positive,perfect summer comedy
Jul 17 2016,positive,i thought this was a great fun film it doesnt try to be the original but is chock full of nods to its past the leading actors are funny and play off of one another well the plot line is straight forward yet complex enough to keep an audience interested and the action scenes are fantastic kate mckinnon is hilarious and chris hemsworth plays dumb obscenely well
Jul 17 2016,positive,very funny great new take on the ghostbusters brand loved how elements from the original movie including original cast cameos were incorporated yet this ghostbusters held its own with the new cast and storyline also nice to see a melissa mccarthy movie that is not laden with the fbomb every other sentence
Jul 17 2016,positive,funny women strong script and loving call backs to the original very much enjoyed this movie straight through the credits
Jul 17 2016,negative,not terrible  but not great i felt like i was watching an advertisement for a new ride at disney world or maybe a made for tv movie but i definitely want be upset if they dont make a sequel and if they do i will probably pass
Jul 17 2016,neutral,ghostbusters    its not terrible its just not good  great cast but the talent is wasted all of this is rather disappointing considering it features many of the same cast and crew as the hilarious bridesmaids for something so obvious it left me confused as to why some of the involved talent didnt contribute to the writing    walking out of the theater i didnt hate it but i couldnt help but wonder why does this exist then i put away my wallet    510  if theres something weird and it dont look good its this movie
Jul 17 2016,negative,if you are having a good day and want to ruin it then go see this movie
Jul 17 2016,positive,what a fun movie with a witty joke every minute the castory has great chemistry a must see
Jul 17 2016,neutral,unnecessary sequel unnecessary to watch it was fine just not for me
Jul 17 2016,positive,i thought this movie was a lot of fun about as funny as the first if they would have unleashed melissa mccarthy  it might have been funnier the characters had good chemistry and the each their moment in the limelight the cameos were a great addition  i think a lot of people ought to check their chauvinism at the door maybe they would have liked the movie better
Jul 17 2016,positive,good humor good special effects horrible ecto 1
Jul 17 2016,positive,a family member of mine worked on the original 1984 film as a stunt double so ive seen it quite a few times when the reboot was announced i was ecstaticand more so when i discovered some of my favorite names in comedy were starring in it the endless train of reboots and plays on nostalgia can of course be too tryhard and flop epically this film however does not buckle under the pressure its funny and smart with enough shoutouts to the original sprinkled throughout to delight fans the newness of the films big bad meant that we werent walking the same tired ground which kept it from being tedious the stars had a great energy and seemed to work well together yes they are all women no their womanhood is not the focus or the crux of the film any more than manhood is or should be the crux of films that do not star primarily women overall it was a delight there were laughs lasers and badass fight scenes
Jul 17 2016,positive,a lot of fun  pays very good homage to the original
Jul 17 2016,positive,the people that didnt go see it because its a female cast really missed out its extremely funny and a good laugh for the whole family
Jul 17 2016,negative,a gender swapped parody of the original the jokes fail to land poor exposition poor execution
Jul 17 2016,positive,perfectly pg13 fun meta jokes kate mckinnon was amazing chris hemsworth did incredible good popcorn movie
Jul 17 2016,negative,the most mediocre comedy ive ever seen it just wasnt funny
Jul 17 2016,positive,folks dont read what some 35 year old loser writes from his moms basement because this movie was great and a rare remake that is not a carbon copy of the original you will like this movie tons and the cameos from the original cast are memorable
Jul 17 2016,positive,it has been a long time since i have laughed out loud in a movie this film had me cracking up through most of the movie  i happened to watch the old ghostbusters the night before and have to say this one is actually much better  im not sure why there reviews from others arent better maybe the bar is higher now than when the original came out  they still have to wrap the plot with some silly scifi special effects because it is after all ghostbusters but the humor is every bit as good as in bridesmaides go see it  its fun
Jul 17 2016,positive,fun night at the movies finally i can bring my 11yearold daughter to a film where the lead characters are badass female scientists she adored it
Jul 17 2016,negative,talented ensemble cast cant help poor direction and editing  scenes are shot to dazzle rather than to move plot  reminds me of a theme park licensed movie ride
Jul 17 2016,positive,funny worth the view
Jul 17 2016,positive,fun trip to the theater actually worth watching twice i think
Jul 17 2016,positive,funny and fun  great job of capturing the spirit of the original honoring it but doing its own thing  satisfying cameos  another successful paul feigmelissa mccarthykristen wiig collab  if you didnt know kate mckinnon might be the funniest person alive right now get with the times  if youre afraid leslie jones might be a bit too abrasiveas she often is on snl shes not  she manages to actually be funny and useful when her nonscientist original ghostbusters counterpart really wasnt watch it
Jul 17 2016,positive,the feigesque humor of the first half gives way to a mixed bag of action in the second half some action set pieces are a blast to watch while others lack real tension still the cast alone is enough to carry it especially the electric kate mckinnon
Jul 17 2016,positive,this movie was fantastic silly fun and nonstop hilarity with comedy that was easygoing and natural every character from the main four to unnamed side character was unique and interesting definitely a mustsee whether youve seen the original ghostbusters or not five stars no doubt cant wait to see it again
Jul 17 2016,positive,thought it was pretty enjoyable went with a group on a sunday around 3 pm and the theater was packed full we also watched the original film first which turned out to be a good idea since it helped us catch more of the references in the new film thought the cast was great there was good pacing and the effects were entertaining all around id give it maybe 710 and i really hope they make a sequel
Jul 17 2016,positive,i dont typically write a review but this movie deserves more credit from users  its funny fresh and hilarious i think people are going into it with a negative view but once you watch it youll change your mind         this movie in no way tarnishes the original just honours it  enjoy
Jul 17 2016,positive,fastpaced joyous return for the ghostbusters franchise the original was the first film i remember seeing in the theater and it is very dear to my heart this film lives up to it and surpasses it in almost every way pretty much the only thing that missed was the absolutely god awful fall out boy remake of the classic theme song its sad too see all these chauvinistic bigots giving it a poor review because of the allfemale protagonists in the name of chastising their mythical pc culture get a life losers this film is a sure fire hit
Jul 17 2016,positive, to everyone who spent so much time for and against the rebootwas this really worth it the new ghostbusters trailer was underwhelming i admit and the first fifteen minutes only made the concerns worse the jokes werent landing the editing seemed choppy it was starting to feel like a waste of time but eventually ghostbusters hits its stride and doesnt really stop providing enough good laughs and enjoyable lead characters that at the least do nothing to tarnish the legacy of the original
Jul 17 2016,positive,i was pleasantly surprised how much fun this movie was i think most of the bile in these comments would change if the reviewers would see the movie instead of the trailer the only complaint i have is the new theme song yuck
Jul 17 2016,positive,it was amazing i cant believe how much i laughed im so glad i took my daughters to see this they deserve to see a movie with four actresses as funny as these
Jul 17 2016,positive,i see all these low ratings and all i can think about is the sheer volume of male tears wasted not laughing at this movie kate mckinnon is brilliant the audience in my theater burst into applause at multiple points in the movie funny enough it was the throwbacks  bill murray dan ackroyd  that slowed the progression of the movie if at all this was 100 worth watching and i will be rewatching this every time i rewatch the first one the rapport between the women is also great and i thought this was my favorite performance of melissa mccarthys in a long time great role for her where her body also isnt used as a punchline it was an absolute blast to cheer for these ghostbusters throughout the movie  they even made tongue in cheek references to the ridiculous criticism  flaming this movie has gotten key line from the film bitches cant hunt ghosts
Jul 17 2016,negative,yes the plot is almost a mirror image of the first 2 movies but fell flat in its execution even the flaws of ghostbusters 2 dont amount to the poor acting and writing displayed in this movie while wiig mckinnon and jones were at times enjoyable mccarthy was her usual terrible self and surprisingly hemsworth was horrible in this movie due to a horribly written character i only caught myself laughing once in the movie the last act was anti climatic with only highlight being slimmers return to the big screen was it the steaming pile most predicted no but still in the end was a disappointment and leaves this ghostbusters fan unsatisfied
Jul 17 2016,positive,first and foremost the cast is outstanding nothing less could be expected from wiig and mccarthy and comedic relative newcomers jones and mckinnon add great splashes of character to the group the people who judge this movie solely on its gender change are shortsighted at best and should not be heeded when judging the films merits hemsworth is an absolute riot as the busters secretary    pros   gags and jokes both intelligent and shallow  great acting  mandatory but not overlyinvasive homage to the originals  a pacing and style current with a modern audience just entering into the franchise    cons  somewhat rushed plotpoints for a more traditional audiencefans of the originals  heavy requirement of suspension of disbelief  pandering 3d coming at you effects for the 3d crowd    the movie wasnt amazing nor was it bad its a great escape for a couple of hours as a summer movie which is really all thats required    to anybody still stuck in the rut of thinking there was an agenda with certain decisions made for this movie i will point out that almost the entire original cast makes cameos in the reboot symbolically showing their approval for the decisions made with the cast our ghostbusting heroes of old gave us their seals of approval    maybe we should too
Jul 17 2016,positive,i was expecting this movie to be horrible but this movie is actually good it scared me at some point which is awesome for a ghost movie and it made me laugh several times i saw it on 3d and it looked great i would for sure go watch it again
Jul 17 2016,positive,so to be perfectly honest i did not go into this with high expectations i didnt think a reboot was necessary and the only reason i even considered going was the four main actresses and you know what i was pleasantly surprised the writing was quick and funny the special effects were amazing and it had enough homages to the original to satisfy fans while still letting these ladies be their own story i particularly loved the part with the youtube comment about them ladies cant catch no ghosts which im pretty sure was a real comment left online about the reboot and as expected the four main ladies were fabulous all of them were smart and hilarious it was nice to see kristen wiig play more of the straight man as was to see melissa mccarthy not play someone gruff and lowbrow and the chemistry between the two of them from bridesmaids is still totally there leslie jones was hilarious because duh leslie jones but i will say for me kate mckinnon stole the show im pretty sure i laughed at everything that came out of her mouth and i lived for her fight moment at the end with her ghost pistolwhips throw in using chris hemsworth playing a hot dumb dude in distress to make fun of typical movie tropes and i was throughly entertained the whole time was this reboot necessary i think my answer is still no but that doesnt negate how much fun this was to watch
Jul 17 2016,negative,wiig mccarthy jones mckinnon aykroyd and murrary in the cast yet the movie was an unfunny rehash that disappoints rental at best
Jul 17 2016,negative,i had such high hopess for this movie went to go see the best part of the movie was the first 15 minutes the first and second ghost is about the best part of the movie after that it is very cheesy and it seems like the writers have given up i know  the director that did this movie is supposed to be some hot shot but this is a absolute bomb he has ruined the ghostbusters franchise and it  goes to show never stray away from the original  script
Jul 17 2016,positive,great in 3d especially the end credits
Jul 17 2016,positive,ghostbusters review     i just saw the new ghostbusters and ill tell you the nay sayers have it wrong i did not go and expect this movie to beat the original classic movie it is truly hard to compare a remake that is based on a classic that was made over 30 years ago all i can say for this movie is that i had so much fun and it is truly amazing that my generation now has its own ghostbusters     melissa mccarthy kristen wig kate mckinnon leslie jones and chris hemsworth did a fantastic job in their roles the lead women had such chemistry between them and the jokes landed perfectly when they were delivered and chris hemsworth played such a dumb character that he was truly funny every time he was on screen i mean it does not get better that he touches his eyes instead of his ears when there are loud noises going on hilarious the story also was great here because it did not copy the original story it took parts from it but then made a concept that was truly original which is something i truly respected about the film     paul feig is truly the master of comedy films that is why he brought in these wonderful women to display comedy heart and amazing chemistry from all of his other films and their own works what was truly special is that they paid tribute to the original classic but then threw in original concepts funny jokes and amazing scenery to the film the ghosts were truly cool looking and a special effects knocked it out of park     and i am one of the only people that is reviewing this film and liked the cameos yes they couldve done more with them but for what they did it was just really cool to see the original cast back together and having fun    i know many people have also complained about the villain in this movie and yes they could have put a bigger star in the role and couldve done more with his backstory of how he came into the picture but this film was not just about the villain and i did not have any problem with him coming into the film and creating all sorts of havoc that was by design and i have no issue with it     this film is not perfect in any circumstances but what do you expect of a film of this nature the only thing you can expect from this movie is that it pays respect to the classic original ghostbusters bring some originality to it funny jokes that arent forced or that are bland good chemistry between all the cast members and a great setting and visual effects in my opinion this movie did all of those things it is not fair to any film of this nature to be compared to a classic piece of cinema that will stand alone in the history of filmmaking you cannot go and see this movie with those types of expectations you have to see this movie for the sure amount of fun excitement and absolute hilarious comedy if you are truly a fan of the original movies as i am then you will really love this film    rating 910
Jul 17 2016,positive,i did not go to this movie to compare it to the old one this movie drew me in because of the cast what people are missing is the message this movie brings which our daughters helped us realize by saying i wanna be her referring to kate mckinnon who surprisingly was the breakout funnier one in this film  instead of wanting to be a unrealistic supermodel beach body type that can only be saved by a hunky surfer this movie portrayed women as they shouldsmart funny sassy brave and wonderful although the whole cast is beautiful as they are the movie did not portray them as most films do with women it was a refreshing twist to a classic to add a all female ghost busting crew two critiques would be that kristin wiig and melissa mcarthy were almost too tame in this film i assumed they would be the more outspoken crazy funny ones leslie jones and kate mckinnon were the majority of the humor dont get me wrong though it was a well balanced perspective also the main villain seemed a little dorky to actually be someone who could open up a vortex overall i would see this again the effects were sometimes campy but the storyline didnt keep me bored and had a great flow to it
Jul 17 2016,positive,if you liked the first ghostbusters movie you will like this one as well
Jul 17 2016,positive,a funny and entertaining movie if people werent determined to hate it this would fast become a classic save your disdain for the many movies that actually warrant it
Jul 17 2016,positive,really enjoyed the movie it is very rare to see a mostly female cast with no unnecessary romance plot it also had really cool guns
Jul 17 2016,positive,its ok  the vibrant visual effects were good but it wasnt as funny as it could have been
Jul 17 2016,positive,a fun remake in spite of uneven writingacting ironically hemsworth may be tge best thing about this film
Jul 17 2016,positive,funny and ridiculous  enjoyable even if not to the level of original
Jul 17 2016,positive,i think that this movie was great it payed homage to the original film and even had some of them as cameos as somewhat important roles plus the genderswap was good fun and the wise cracking jokes were great
Jul 17 2016,positive,as a lifelong ghostbusters fan i walked in expecting to hate it left laughing smiling and wanting to watch it again much fun its ghostbusters
Jul 17 2016,positive,this film delivers even as a standalone picture and is consistently hilarious
Jul 17 2016,positive,if you are comparing it too much to the original or are one of those wannabe critic fanboys you are probably one of the people who hated this movie as a fan of the ghostbusters franchise in general i loved it and felt as a stand alone away from the originals it is a funny and awesome film that even gave me goosebumps at times a fun ride i will enjoy again and again i hope there is a sequel in the works
Jul 17 2016,negative,not funny  at all  especially sad given the great cash and premise  an embarrassment to the franchise
Jul 17 2016,neutral,i think it will be better for the younger people that didnt see the original  because the original when it came out was one of the best movies of that time  and thats hard to replicate
Jul 17 2016,negative,the reviews are true this movies is barely watchable
Jul 17 2016,positive,great movie it puts a modern spin on a beloved classic
Jul 17 2016,negative,i cannot be more disappointed about this movie no even one joke was fun
Jul 17 2016,positive,i was skeptical at first being a huge fan of the originals dont listen to all of the noise this is a great summer action comedy that really surprised me it was a finer edit than what fieg usually does and none of the jokes drug on long if anything the movie was too short its a great addition to the ghostbusters universe
Jul 17 2016,positive,it was funnier than what i was expecting
Jul 17 2016,neutral,yawn trite juvenile not funny or witty or clever waste of talent aimless direction dubious editing and why the heck didnt they play the ghostbusters theme more than once not as good as either gb 1 or 2 not really anything to even remember helmsworth had  a good stint as the dumb as rocks eye candy and mckinnon looked ready to contribute more but alas it was not to be rts rating is waay too high
Jul 17 2016,negative,slow and very repeating  rehashing past great movies yet again  it did have a few funny moments but nothing that id say it could have been  two amazing movie actresses and two strong snl actors could have given this movie such a strong pull but it seemed to just fail
Jul 17 2016,positive,while not as original or charming as the originalcome on how could it be it stood well on its own while bringing solid clean comedy and strong effects     to be clear though this is not a movie for small children or anyone who has an inclination for nightmares theres enough suspenseful scenes and some of the ghosts have freaky moments other than that its ok for families     finally the 3d effects were finally effective this movie is worth the price of 3dimax  admission they made great use of the technology and it wasnt just a gimmick     overall this movie is a solid 3755
Jul 17 2016,positive,took my sons to see ghostbusters this weekend and it was awesome genuinely funny and a good movie in its own right while still paying loving tribute to the original the action and special effects were great and when chris hemsworths character was introduced i laughed so hard i cried good flick highly recommend for a light hearted fun little bit scary time with the whole family this summer
Jul 17 2016,positive,lots of fun goofy campy silly  truly in the spirit pun intended as the original the cameos were fun and just part of the hattips to its predecessor
Jul 17 2016,positive,dont know why people hating on this movie pure fun
Jul 17 2016,positive,not as funny as the original but still very good there are plenty of sly references to the original but its a total reboot same premise told in a new way    and unlike the horror that was the attempted star wars relaunch this new version of an old favorite doesnt attempt to gender bend the lead roles just for the sake of it the ladies in this new version come off as originals not cheap clones of their male counterparts    the star wars relaunch was calculated to offend everyone who appreciated the original but ghostbusters 2016 is just different enough that even if you really liked the first one and didnt see the need for a remake youll like the new one for new reasons
Jul 17 2016,positive,awesome movie absolutely hilarious all actors did a spectacular job ive always loved melissa mccarthy and kristen wiig theyre so funny but my new fav is kate mckinnon she was hysterical first comedy in awhile that keep me laughing the entire time loved it
Jul 17 2016,negative,it sacked period not because the ghostbusters happened to be ladies or leslie jones was the stereotype loud character she was but it was just a poorly written movie with horrible jokes idiocracy level gags and major disrespects to the original movie i really hope this movie flops to teach the industry to make actual good movies and not cash grabbers its also sad seeing people afraid to be honest and go very critical on this movie like they usually ate just for the fear of being labeled a sexist or racist dont let fear and pressure silence your opinion anyways i hated this movie dont see it and see the original movie or the cartoons
Jul 17 2016,positive,absolutely hilarious  these women have amazing chemistry a few scenes were bit long but my husband i laughed through the whole movie  ill admit as a child of the late 80s early 90s i grew up with the movies and cartoon initially i was horrified that a complete reboot was being made  i have always been a hardcore fan of the original franchise    the new movie did not disappoint  as i said before these ladies have amazing chemistry  i loved all of the references to the original throughout  stay all the way through the credits you wont regret it
Jul 17 2016,positive,fucking hilarious great cast loved every minute stay after credits for additional footage
Jul 17 2016,positive,whoever made the trailer for this movie should  be banished from hollywood while not perfect and missing any kind of legitimate villain the movie surpassed expectations kate m certainly put in the best performance and made up for the two leading ladies overall it paid proper homage to the beloved original ghostbusters and is worth a watch in theaters
Jul 17 2016,positive,the haters are going to have to eat their words ghostbusters was hilarious was it perfect no but it pretty darn funny there will inevitably be a some percentage of the male population that will despise it but its not the movies fault for playing someone elses game successfully
Jul 17 2016,positive,the torch has been passed for a new generation of ghost busting and the cast has amazing chemistry  energy to live up to the name this new ghostbusters is hilarious and action packed
Jul 17 2016,positive,if you are a feminist you will love this movie  if you are mysoginist or you dont know what a mysoginist is you will hate this movie  safety lights are for dudes
Jul 17 2016,negative,ill put it to you this way recent adam sandler movies are better than this sexist garbage
Jul 17 2016,positive,hilarious i loved it each of the comediennes had her own way of cracking me up and chris hemsworth is both funny and smoking hot it was also very cool of dan akroyed bill murray and ernie hudson to support this movie with their sweet cameos this is my favorite movie of the year so far
Jul 17 2016,negative,in a movie where the women are crying that haters just dont like a female cast it is funny that chris hemsworth stole the show with the only truly performance  it is a shame that the people involved feel that crude and vulgar equals funny  too many jokes about womens privates and a pointless use of giving the bird  this film could easily have been a pg if they just cut some of that useless junk  other than that this film did not offer anything that didnt seem forced as they redid scenes from the original but just not as well   originality had a lot to do with the original films success  it is a shame that so many parents take their young children to this stuff
Jul 17 2016,positive,i really liked it i was actually literally in tears during one of the scenes and i got most of the humor of the movie kate mckinnon and leslie jones also had some truly excellent scenes
Jul 17 2016,positive,give it a chance  i laughed quiet a bit  funny cameos that add as a homage to the ghostbusterverse  tech was cool and the special fx made it worth seeing  love the ladies and had no problem with them replacing the heroes from my childhood
Jul 17 2016,positive,very funny great oneliners and cameos by many of the original cast kate mckinnon is outstanding
Jul 17 2016,positive,very entertaining the ladies did a great job it is hard to compare to the original but this one was a nice new take with great references to the original and cameos by nearly all the original cast that alone made it worth seeing
Jul 17 2016,positive,this movie was really funny and my daughter and i enjoyed it
Jul 17 2016,negative,they did there best but the story sucked the only good parts was when the audience saw the cameos and leslie jones race joke
Jul 17 2016,positive,laughed more than i have in quite a while  wasnt sure about this but i loved it more than the original  actors were great  loved the cameos  and everything was just fun  we may see it a second time to make sure we really loved it as much as we think we did but i was definitely entertained
Jul 17 2016,positive,funny movie and well done lots of laughable  scenes
Jul 17 2016,positive,funny stuff great cast
Jul 17 2016,positive,while it never reaches the heights of the original the new ghostbusters presents something new and entertaining and even if some moments are not as good as others it presents a better version of this film than anyone wouldve thought
Jul 17 2016,positive,i really loved this reboot so much i think ghostbusters is getting a bad rap i think it was a solid summer movie
Jul 17 2016,positive,loved this movie very funny
Jul 17 2016,negative,the comedy was either lousycheap or mediocre i feel this version didnt add anything special or original to the ghostbusters story all it really is is female ghostbusters and thats about it and for a much bigger budget the cgi somehow was actually a lttle worse than the original  1984 film
Jul 17 2016,positive,i think people are just critiquing the movie just to do so  taking it for what it is its a super fun movie
Jul 17 2016,positive,so much fun loved it
Jul 17 2016,positive,we had a lot of fun with this one great comedy team go into this as a whole new movie and not a sequel or remake that is the mistake most users are making its a new idea on a classic franchise the cameos of every character from 1984 living and dead was an added bonus enjoy
Jul 17 2016,positive,better than the original
Jul 17 2016,positive,dont believe the trolls whove been spamming this title with 1 star ratings since the film was released i actually saw it and it was actually hilarious
Jul 17 2016,positive,all you fan boys can shut up and get over yourselve this a great movie with great actors and a great story definitely  worth it
Jul 17 2016,positive,this was one of the best movies ive seen this year most definitely on of the top five in my list a perfect mix of horror and humor with only a few jump scares originally saw this movie because i liked the original love the reboot   the cameo appearances from the original cast were perfect in all senses of the word
Jul 17 2016,positive,eh solid c way too much dead time  nothing happening scenes shorten the film by 20min and allow it to be entertaining from beginning to end
Jul 17 2016,negative,the actresses really tried but the humor fell flat decent special effects but just a boring movie overall if you really want to see it recommend waiting until it hits netflix
Jul 17 2016,negative,kate m shines in her role but her great performance isnt enough to carry this movie
Jul 17 2016,positive,much better than we expected from the audience review  it was great fun in 3d
Jul 17 2016,positive,go see it dont mind all the sexist haters this is a great movie loved all the cameos and all the ladies are so great ill probably go see it again in theaters
Jul 17 2016,positive,funny  better than expected  kids laughed hard
Jul 17 2016,negative,this is what happens when you dont give nerds what they want
Jul 17 2016,negative,i will say the first 20 mins is quite good and i was genuinely surprised how good it was then they kept repeating the same jokes and they didnt work in the first place they gave no time for character just kept firing one liners out in the hope someone will laugh    the effects feel dated they would of looked fantastic in 2006 but in 2016 theyre awful and in an effects driven movie theyre kind of important     i was looking forward to a female lead gb movie expecting something witty clever and funny like the idw gb comics but what i saw was a mess of a movie with bad editing and poor directing creating a film which fails as science fiction and as comedy    i genuinely hope they make more ghostbusters movies its one of my favourite franchises and there was so much potential for this to be better maybe give the next film to a director who doesnt have an agenda or trying to send out a message give it to a director who just wants to make a good movie          25 1 point for the first 20mins 1 point for the only cameo from the original cast that worked wont spoil it for you
Jul 17 2016,positive,excellent it was funny as hell funnier than the original  stands on its own
Jul 17 2016,negative,super cheesy jokes melissa mccarthy yelling as always except this time shes yelling with leslie jones kristen wiig is the same person she always is the movie just failed to keep your attention any redeemable qualities that paul feig has with this movie is literally wiped away with a terrible after credits scene
Jul 17 2016,neutral,the avengers recycled plot
Jul 17 2016,negative,what a giant turd this  movie is  insult to the original classic women need to stay clear of moies like this how would like to see a remake of black hawk down with a bunch of chicks chris hemsworth should be ashamed of himself for christ sake   hes fucking thor  playing the fool for these fat asses is a disgrace
Jul 17 2016,positive,the original is better but this is still very entertaining
Jul 17 2016,positive,great movie perfect balance of callbacks to the original while maintaining the integrity of its own story and characters  the humor was spoton with nothing too raunchy so bring your kids  the story was surprisingly heartwarming and is actually in essence a story about friendship underneath all the hilarity and action which i thought made it a much deeper movie than the original in that sense  overall great reboot i highly recommend it
Jul 17 2016,negative,probably should wait until its on redbox
Jul 17 2016,positive,great movie only thing is way too long there is like 30 min that could be cut villain actor not so great
Jul 17 2016,positive,entertaining and the jokes were somewhat funny quite boring at parts though a solid meh rating
Jul 17 2016,negative,completely crap full of  double standard sexism should be tossed in trash it steals tons from older ghost busters movies
Jul 17 2016,positive,really enjoyed this and laughed the whole time
Jul 17 2016,positive,as a genxer im an original franchise fan  believe it or not this film has a solid script with sharp wit and satire  it won me over  for the naysayers  get over it  the female cast is a strong and the film highlights the comedic strengths of each  this is a fun summer comedy that wont put you to sleep
Jul 17 2016,negative,a soul crushing attempt at nostalgia terrible for those still hoping for a ghost worth chasing after ghost busters 2 just bad for new audiences seeking a fun summer romp
Jul 17 2016,positive,this movie was a good time its funny the cameos by the original cast even harold ramis keep your eyes peeled were well done and the story was good kate mckinnon is definitely the standout among the new cast and im still laughing at zach woods monologue in the opening scene
Jul 17 2016,positive,i liked everything about this movie something i surely cannot say about the original
Jul 17 2016,positive,i gave it 4 stars and glenda gave it 5 nice story and plot some funny bits  went back and rewatched the first two movies i had forgotten how sexist they were this is also a goof correction   added get the expanded dvd bluray or streaming version that adds some scenes thoughtlessly cut from the theater release
Jul 17 2016,negative,unnecessary cash grab
Jul 17 2016,positive,tries really hard on so much succeeds on occasion
Jul 17 2016,negative,some of the audience was laughing but not me i fell asleep half way through the movie
Jul 17 2016,positive,way way better than i ever imagined and honestly probably better than it deserved to be but a quartet of solid comedic actors carry this through a sometumes flat script with other lol moments and just enough homages to the original gb
Jul 17 2016,positive,paul feig set out to make a movie that nobody would hate and for the most part he probably succeeded
Jul 17 2016,positive,it pays homage to the old and is in itself a super exciting and cool movie i would definitely suggest people go see it in theaters in 3d i would also go see it again myself
Jul 17 2016,positive,god yes this is my new favorite movie incredible cast amazing visuals unlike all the people who leave rude comments i actually went to see it today and please please listen to me when i say it is soooo worth your money
Jul 17 2016,positive,this was a great movie  the female cast was phenomenal and it was fun seeing the cameos of actors from the original ghostbusters  these women were funny and held their own and more  the whole experience of watching the movie was really really fun yay to a female led film and keep in mind safety lights are for dudes 
Jul 17 2016,positive,loved it the fresh cast full of old  new faces made for a hilarious movie would definitely watch again
Jul 17 2016,positive,i was one of these who thought this was going to be a train wreck i was wrong this movies stands on its own and was very entertaining
Jul 17 2016,positive,as good as the original  better because its new different and uptodate as far as the free spirited socio and political comedy that such snlrs are known for in fact if you watch the credits you see the original creators all have a hand on it somehow  so if theyre fine then its all good ps my mom laughed so hard she had tears rolling down happy busting love from harley the kid
Jul 17 2016,positive,who are you going call  the original version  the 4 main leads were strong and worked together  however the plot was weak and the villian was beyond marvel bad  howvever i think the main problem was the lack of understanding of what it was in comparison to the originals  having the original cast make rnandom cameos as different people made no sense  what i think they should have done was to have erin  kristen wiigs character egons daughter  have there been no ghost sightings in twenty years and so the original ghostbusters went out of business  when the new ghost appear the old tech isnt sufficient so erin and her companions must upgrade as egon has passed  rip harold remos  this would allow the old to fit naturally into the film while bringing up a new generation
Jul 17 2016,positive,movie was awesome was really impressed and was actually funny will see again great to have ghodtbsuters back
Jul 17 2016,negative,a film that first joke is about pussy farts  a film that portrait all men as either idiots or bullies  a film that is on par with eddie murphys haunted mansion cgi  a film that the villain is defeated by being shot in the crotch  you can call me sexist you can call me mysoginist  but this is a fucking garbage movie
Jul 17 2016,positive,i had a good time at this one
Jul 17 2016,positive,pleasantly surprised by how good it turned out at least as good as the first great cast especially mckinnon antagonist isnt that interesting but basement dwelling women haters rarely are sorry sexists this film is very good 
Jul 17 2016,positive,so much fun i loved it so much when we were little girls were told we couldnt be ghostbusters and this proved to me that we can be not a perfect movie but one of the best times ive had at the movie in a while
Jul 17 2016,positive,fun summer movie nice homage to the original
Jul 17 2016,positive,its pretty good much better than people wouldve expected
Jul 17 2016,positive,it was fantastic there were parts that made me really jump from fright and parts that made me cheer if you loved the first one and truly loved them then this will take you right back to the first time you saw it in theaters so many things they did right with the original they did right with this one and made it even better the things they did badly with the original were left out of this one and it was a relief that left nothing but good feelings afterwards im still smiling ill be buying it for home viewing as well as soon as possible
Jul 17 2016,positive,i laughed a lot and had a great time watching it thats all i want in a comedy and ghostbusters delivered the script could definitely use some tightening up and polishing but other than that it was fine
Jul 17 2016,negative,boring movie not even all the cameos help this movie
Jul 17 2016,positive,so badass very funny a few charming plotholes
Jul 17 2016,neutral,very meh bad story meant to appeal to kids the humor is mostly juvenile leslie jones plays a stereotype some feminist themes are insultingly in your face and the effects are just cartoony
Jul 17 2016,positive,amazing movie the whole crowd was laughing and it honestly deserves more of a chance and a higher rating because the sexists are giving it a 0 which is really unfair to a great movie
Jul 17 2016,negative,it doesnt even try to be a good movie  paul feig and rotten tomatoes thinks most of the world are idiots  he is probably right
Jul 17 2016,positive,all and all its entertaining if you judge it against the previous movies then it obviously is not as good the pacing seemed a little slow but i felt like the character interaction made up for that the end was pretty great
Jul 17 2016,positive,the fun is there i am so glad it is its own movie with nods to the original rather than a copy the trolls on the internet should be ashamed as this is fun funny and a great film the best part is the lesser known in england cast they make the film the let down is that the plot and story is mixed and lacking dont let that put you off though you will laugh more than enough to justify the trip to a cinema on dvd this will be a given in your collection
Jul 17 2016,positive,beat film of the year  in my opinion 
Jul 17 2016,positive,so good and got straight to the point
Jul 17 2016,positive,fun movie all around  quick witted comments and some laugh out loud moments
Jul 17 2016,positive,not as bad as people thought but the originals are way better
Jul 17 2016,negative,i went with an open mind i thought the movie was poor i am a huge ghostbusters fan and feel let down by this movie
Jul 17 2016,negative,i paid to watch this piece of trash movie  shocked that the cast decided to do this film  unbelievable ratings
Jul 17 2016,positive,its just funny not the best movie ive ever seen not the best movie ive seen this year not even the best movie ive seen this summer but i enjoyed it a lot and dont have any huge complaints all the acting was good most of the jokes were solid and i laughed a lot the whole thing was just fun
Jul 17 2016,negative,while are there some laughs to be had they are owed entirely to the cast of comedians the worst parts of this movie are the groaninducing references and bythenumbers finale which made me wish for a nonghostbusters movie with the same cast
Jul 17 2016,positive,this movie was super entertaining the whole way through these comedians are at the top of their game go see it
Jul 17 2016,negative,not funny outright painful
Jul 17 2016,negative,do yourself a favor and avoid this movie the biggest problem is none of the characters is likable so you arent rooting for them
Jul 17 2016,positive,exceeded expectations
Jul 17 2016,positive,it has its moments but just doesnt have the quality of the original
Jul 17 2016,positive,really fun movie  im a huge fan of the original this was a fun ride with just enough references to the first one
Jul 17 2016,negative,this is worse than independence day  just saw it an hour ago  i would wait to rent
Jul 17 2016,positive,this movie was not only funny but  invigorating the entire time i was smiling and enjoying myself something i usually dont do at the movies i loved how the roles were reversed and 4 protagonists were smart females and the assistant was only hired because of his looks for anyone who is saying that this was sexist and wrong because no one is hired just because of their looks or gender open your eyes and take a long look at the world around you ghostbusters was thoroughly empowering movie that i cant wait to see again
Jul 17 2016,positive,great summer movie it packs a ton of action comedy and nods to its predecessor all without a lick of romance  jones and mckinnon were the best
Jul 17 2016,positive,my family and i have always enjoyed the ghostbustes franchise years ago i learned that dan aykroyd was pushing hard for a third movie with no success and i was always rooting for him i was thrilled when i learned they finally got the support for the next movie even the idea of a reboot was fine with me i cant understand why people are so threatened by reboots anyway i saw it with my wife and son and we all loved it the cast did an excellent job  were very funny and each brought a distinct comic element my son insisted we see it a second time the next day and i enjoyed it just as much the second time there were many nods to the original and many parallels but all in all the movie stands well on its own im sure there are plenty of people who didnt enjoy the movie but its clear there are a lot of 1star ratings posted by people who clearly have attachment issues with the first movie or some other problem unrelated to the films actual quality come on people the old movies were great the new one is great too some people will see what they want to see in the movie if someone is determined to see it as a man hating movie thats what they will see though i didnt see anything in the movie that would support such a claim or any of the other assertions made by many of the one stars im not a critic and not familiar with the finer points of the movie making art but i do know that everyone in my family loved the movie found it to be very entertaining and look forward to adding it to our video library
Jul 17 2016,positive,better than anticipated terrible trailers and underhanded behindthescenes behavior by sony didnt help this movie in the year leading up to its release additionally the movie is further hindered by its constant need to keep referencing the original movie which this movie is a complete reboot of the movie has plenty of other jarring missteps but overall its more than strong enough and funny enough to stand on its own merits
Jul 17 2016,negative,it was terrible overused jokes that died centuries ago political sterotypes everywhere awful writing its a shame i wanted to see this movie given all of its hype but to just have the story and characters shamed in such a way is a disgrace distasteful and bland
Jul 17 2016,negative,bland contrived uninspired and ultimately unfunny i adore kristen wiig but this film completely missed the mark as a comedy nearly every joke falls flat the cgi looks incredibly outdated and the storyline was trite at best please dont waste your time with this one
Jul 17 2016,positive,totally worthy remake i was all smiles there whole time and i cant wait for the second installment takes me back to my childhood in a great way
Jul 17 2016,positive,haters gonna hate but i found the new ghostbusters better than expected
Jul 17 2016,positive,loved it  as someone who was only 9 yrs old during the original who has loved it and everyone in it including the music since that timei can honestly say they honored harold ramis and the original movie wholeheartedly  great reboot while keeping many of the same elements with a fresh new take  so much fun for a whole new generation of kids  clean humor for the most part with a few 80s moments that are much appreciated by myself as an 80s kid  i highly recommend seeing it ive seen it twice now and think its just wonderful it took me back to my childhood and made me laugh  cry  thank you for the memories
Jul 17 2016,negative,it wasnt a good or a bad movie   it had funny moments but was ruined by poor directing and a sub par screenplay  there were funny bits just not enough to carry it  most of the jokes were forced or out of place  like the director had no idea what he was doing    i was hoping the north korea leak wasnt true about everything  everything was spot on and is sad
Jul 17 2016,positive,this was a funny entertaining movie not sure why so many are being hypercriticalassuming its because they didnt want their childhood memories disrupted its not a direct remake only the premise is the same this film stands on its own and youll enjoy it
Jul 17 2016,positive,super fun and different enough from the originals there were dumb parts but there were also laughs throughout
Jul 17 2016,negative,4 outta 10  another useless reboot they didnt learn a thing from the failures of the recent total recall and robocop and point break remakes classic kickass movies like those originals do not need to be redone sigh    of course i gotta start off by saying i dont mind the allgirl cast sjws are quick to label guys who dislike this movie as womenhaters i totally dont mind femalecentred flicks they can absolutely be kickass sigourney weaver from one of my fav movies of all time aliens linda hamilton from another one of my fav movies of all time t2 michelle yeoh cynthia rothrock daisy ridley angelina jolie all of anime the wife who kicked queens rangers ass in the tv show turn washingtons spies they can absolutely be hilarious tina fey amy poehler anna faris janeane garofalo mary louise parker gillian jabcos so there    anyway ghostbusters wasnt absolute shit but it wasnt good either i wouldnt even say it was okay it was just below okay it was meh i giggled maybe twice and lold just once otherwise i was mainly bored there was nothing to the movie it was pointless unnecessary and not worth it    kristen wiig was fine she was subdued not very outrageous she did her straightlaced schtick fine her burn in hell was my one lol melissa mccarthy wasnt all that annoying despite talking so much but she didnt do anything really memorable kate mckinnon was great her eccentric behaviour and personality was awesome needed more dialogue and screentime from her i dreaded seeing leslie jones all she did was scream and yell definitely the stereotypical loud angry black woman as everyone said she was hell naw and hell yeah twice chris hemsworth will give you a ladyboner and he was hilarious too i smirked at all his scenes    there was an actual bad guy totally pointless and forgettable why have him at all  ghost effects were pretty cool but they needed to dial down the glowinthedark look apparently ghosts can be cut in pieces thrown against things shot and killed huh so much technobabble repetitive directing and scenes no kickass moments that made me fistpump all meh lotsa cameos most of which added nothing to the movie they didnt give me any nostalgia goosebumps useless pandering    see the common trend useless pointless meh no need to see ghostbusters in theatre save your moneypointsgift cards wait till netflix
Jul 17 2016,negative,should you like the lowest kind of comedy and not the fun sassy kind we experienced in the 1984 ghostbusters there is a good chance you will enjoy this    cgi is cheesy at best if you like nickelodeon or scooby doo movie effects the characters hardly made me smirk jokes just feel too random and cartoonish the villain is so weak and forgettable its laughable after seeing this movie i forgot he was in it if this gets a sequel i will be amazed the actors were good but they are not great thanks to the cartoon characters they had to play i will say thanks to paul fieg for making me want to watch the original
Jul 17 2016,negative,this entire film was a mistake next time dont run your ad campaign as a guilt trip against men
Jul 17 2016,positive,hilarious and kickass
Jul 17 2016,positive,why is this being panned so badly we went in with low expectations and were plesently surprised  the story was just different enough to not be a total knock off and the special effects were fantastic  it was great to see all of the old stars make appearences  our family thouroghly enjoyed it and we look forward to the sequal  stick around for the end credits the payoff is worthy
Jul 17 2016,positive,a real fun ride if you want ghostbusters homages and fun genuine female characters kicking paranormal ass this movie will not disappoint fairtomiddlin in ways of pacing but its enough of a joy ride to make up for it all its parts have potential at the very least so i look forward to the sequel  great effects great respects great characters and great fun  5 stars cause it doesnt deserve the hate will see again
Jul 17 2016,positive,couldnt live up the original enough said
Jul 17 2016,positive,its fun  it wont be a classic like the original but its a fine modern version of the story and mckinnons performance alone is worth seeing it
Jul 17 2016,positive,paul feig knows how to do comedy he doesnt know how to do scary this is what the original managed to do so well the film was uneven with the first hour being a blast but the action scenes at the end letting the film down having said that the four leads are great and the movie made for a perfectly entertaining day out hope theres more
Jul 17 2016,positive,great cast some very funny dialog
Jul 17 2016,neutral,ghostbusters will likely go down as one of the most controversial films for absolutely ridiculous reasons  but by no means is this a film that doesnt deserve critique  with laughs built around nostalgia though it swears to have no real connection to the original film ghostbusters is merely a passible comedy    amidst all of the unnecessary hate for the marketing campaign and particularly the choice to have female protagonists ive been one to sit back and watch  ive never understood the need to dislike a film before its release no matter the subject matter  with that said the problems have absolutely nothing to do with its talented 4 lead females  in fact i quite enjoyed the chemistry between kristen wiig melissa mccarthy kate mckinnon and leslie jones    wiig has been one of my favorite comedic actresses for some time now and mccarthy is very good when her character is toned down to a realistic level and she isnt doing to the same shtick in every film  combine them with decent snl up and comers and you have a likable team of ghostbusters  where the film falters is the story built around them  ive had a good time watching paul feigs films in the past but none of them have impressed me quite the way i had hoped    feig seems to prefer silly over a witty approach to his characters  though i liked the performances of all 4 ghostbusters mckinnon and jones feel much more like caricatures than people who would actually live in new york city  even chris hemsworth who i enjoyed every second he was on screen was way more over the top than i would have preferred    this approach did produce many funny moments with laugh out loud gags it cant carry you through an entire 110 minute runtime  its almost like an snl skit could and would have been the better option here  but even as im saying this i know that there is potential here for a great comedy  the foundation of this franchise is set for future installments i just want to see a slightly more serious film with gags here and there mixed in    overall its far from a bad film but its near spoof aesthetic ruined a lot of the enjoyment that i could have had  a nicely structured set up became convoluted and unfortunately a bore when the film crippled its way to the third act  we shall see where this franchise can go from here    4 talented leads have great chemistry    some great gags    weak third act    caricatures    5810
Jul 17 2016,negative,it was bad  real bad  i think they made a ghost of this franchise
Jul 17 2016,positive,funny with stand up and cheer moments it restored my love of all the ghostbusters
Jul 17 2016,positive,dont listen to the whining mras and haters its a solid story that stands on its own and an honest homage to the original dont let frightened boys who hate women influence you
Jul 17 2016,positive,go see it  kate mckinnon is incredible everything is well directed i laugh a lot and even cried 2 times
Jul 17 2016,negative,a few laughs but too few to warrant spending any money on this the male secretary gag wore thin several attempts at abbott and costello humor fell flat as you felt like screaming not funny but increasingly annoying as you continue the bit
Jul 17 2016,positive,a solid movie very much in tune with the originals without feeling out of touch with the modern audience the characters definitely arent rehashes of the original 4 busters and my theater crowd was constantly cracking up during the film
Jul 17 2016,positive,i love the original and was very excited for this one because of that love and the loved of the cast and filmmaker paul feig  overall i was completely enthralled with this film as it delivered some incredible humor awesome action and it had a fantastic cast a killer story and really impressive special effects  the only downside was some characters deserved a little more development but that aside i really enjoyed this film  it honors what came before it and made something that clearly belongs right next to the original  without a doubt i found ghostbusters to be ridiculously fun and just an absolute blast    hello  the name is rev ron and if you feel like it you can check out more of my reviews at the robotspajamascom and on my blog at revronmoviesblogspotcom  you can also follow me on twitter revronster where i dissect on why bustin makes me feel so good  thanks
Jul 17 2016,neutral,this movie is pretty much what i expected but with a much better rotten tomatoes rating the new gadgets were cool and the story wasnt all bad the ghosts looked better than they did in the trailers but the lore behind how ghosts work in the ghostbusters universe almost felt like it was tossed out the window in order for these new weapons to have any merit the humor was at its best when it came from the characters and the situations however some of it felt like it came from a shelved brides maids 2 table reading and whats even worse is some of the humor felt old and cliche the fan service was forced especially the cameos the villain had promise but then they through that out to add more fan service there were too many remakes of the original ghostbusters song its like sony couldnt decide on which one to use so they used them all while these are nitpicks from a fan the film truly falls short in that it wasnt crafted with the same care as the first two installments say what you will about the direct sequel at least the editing didnt feel like a film student cut it together that and the continuity in this film is atrocious did they have a script supervisor the tone drastically changes from scene to scene sometimes things are serious then theyre really goofy sometimes things feel like an old timey horror movie and other times you feel like youre watching men in black 3 with more stuff that glows though it has short comings like every other movie ghostbusters has some great moments that the characters help craft which i will say it was nice to see that each one of these ladies wasnt just a carbon copy female version of the original team each one was their own unique character that really did contribute to the team this film just spends too much time universe building paying respects to its predecessors and reminding us that these ladies all know each other in real life than just trying to be a well crafted movie
Jul 17 2016,positive,this movie is so hilarious  love the new and old cast  i love this new better than the first one
Jul 17 2016,negative,new ghostbusters movie is terrible take the first movie and take out 75 of the funny lines plot and character development and add no new ideas and you have the new ghostbusters all of us who saw it together admitted as we were leaving the theater that we were actually bored and waiting for it to be over
Jul 17 2016,positive,it was hilarious will watch it again with mom
Jul 17 2016,positive,i loved this movie  not only was it kick ass and hilarious but the energy in the theater was amazing  people were cheering clapping and laughing the whole time the effects were really good and it was written very well i will definitely be seeing this again
Jul 17 2016,positive,the movie was funny relevant to today with a bunch of kids to the old version and cute  hollywood needs to make more movies that are just plain oldfashioned fun and this is exactly it
Jul 17 2016,positive,the perfect blend of nostalgia and lady power loved it
Jul 17 2016,positive,this movie changed my life and holtzmann made me gay
Jul 17 2016,positive,goodloved special effectsgirls were great
Jul 17 2016,positive,funny with just enough references to the original we went as a family with two girls ages 12 and 9 and they enjoyed it equally as much great work
Jul 17 2016,positive,this movie is hilarious i laughed out loud the whole time the ghosts look so cool and the ghostfighting gadgets are awesome great characters as well the entire cast was amazing and im a little in love with kate mckinnons character i definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good time
Jul 17 2016,positive,to everyone else this movie stinks but to me its funny and really good its also nice to see bill murray dan aykroyd and ernie hudson make cameo roles in this film also rip harold ramis i do not trust imdb cause if i did a review of this on there people will start complaining also another good reason that some men dont like it is because theyre all being sexist b for this movie so there
Jul 17 2016,positive,fun for the most part  but half the jokes fell flat chris hemsworth was a nice comic addition  stay to the very end past all the credits for one more scene does not live up to the original movie
Jul 17 2016,positive,a great movie  in general
Jul 17 2016,positive,ive been watching the originals since i was a child and this movie was just as fun the humor is different than the original but not even gb 2 could replicate it lots of fun with the effects saturation getting punched up a bit
Jul 17 2016,positive,this movie was sick perfect addition to the franchise
Jul 17 2016,neutral,i loved the first 10 minutes but after that i was just mildly entertained a lot of the humor didnt work for me but the special effects were pretty amazing
Jul 17 2016,positive,as a die hard fan of the original to the point of wanting to be a ghostbuster i was amped about a reboot with female leads  for all those naysayers out there i think you will be pleasantly surprised by this film  it is funny has good action and great cameos and references  im going to go see it again this week because i found it so good  all the leads are great and i think even the smaller parts are well played
Jul 17 2016,negative,not funny almost fell asleep no one in the audience laughed even once too bad you cant give a quarter of a starand that would be generous
Jul 17 2016,positive,i like it it does a good job on its own an it pays homage to past movies
Jul 17 2016,positive,the ghostbusters 2016 was far better than what i was expecting my favorite character was jillian holtzmann she was so funny and kinda had this mad scientisttomboy thing that i digged 
Jul 17 2016,negative,today i tried cheeseburger doritos and ghostbusters one of them tasted like a crisp but shitty knock off of the original thing and the other tasted like cheeseburgers
Jul 17 2016,negative,this movie was exactly what i thought it was from the trailers a terrible cash grab where the source material was neglected and only used for window dressing the jokes fell flat and there were only two or three parts in the movie where the jokes somewhat landed the story was poorly thought out and full of holes the dialogue was atrocious and the character development was very unfulfilling the effects were fine not as bad as the trailer but like many have already stated pulled from beetle juice or the scooby doo franchise  think pixels one more thing that was glaringly obvious is that for a movie studio that has spent the last few months accusing the fans of mysoginy and sexism there wasnt one good male character in the movie all the male characters were either dumb lazy cowards or aholes  overall this movie is a waste of a good license
Jul 17 2016,positive,i really enjoyed this movie it captured the spirit of the franchise while managing to tell its own unique story it is definitely worth seeing melissa mccarthy kristen wiig kate mckinnon and leslie jones are the best
Jul 17 2016,positive,awesome adventure sit back and enjoy the ride was a teen when the first one came out and the family and i loved this one id  tell anyone dont over think this movieits not life changingjust go laugh
Jul 17 2016,positive,funny scary and a great cast of characters
Jul 17 2016,positive,ive seen it twice this movie is so entirely charming i love the new ghostbusters and they all fight so well  realistically competently not so competently holtzmann is a gem i think all the negative press is just people wanting to hate something for the sake of hating something
Jul 17 2016,positive,i liked this movie soooo much it was unique enough yet it has nuisances from the first movies plus cameos incredible
Jul 17 2016,neutral,this was a great fresh take on the beloved original the girls were funny ghosts were even better go see it for your self
Jul 17 2016,negative,ghostbusters 2016 spoilers  ghostbusters 2016 is a film that doesnt really work thankfully its failings are not its main cast who quite easily could have been any gender race or creed but in this case happen to be some of the best comedic actors gender aside working today no the fundamental problems with this movie are firmly rooted in execution the film is not so bad that it goes back in time and urinates on the original by its existence its just feels like another in a long line of cash grabs based on nostalgia  the work of wigg mccarthy jones and mckinnon is overall good but its hard to feel like anyone was utilized to their talents the surprise star for me was leslie jones who has some of the better lines in the movie for some reason the trailer cherrypicked her worst material in the film the thing that makes this character work is that she seems fully formed shes very much playing a real person even if it strikes some as stereotypical shes also the only character that is willing to acknowledge the crazy shit and give it weight yes mckinnon made me laugh and she seems to be having the most fun the problem is the film way overplays her it just becomes a montage of cutting to her for a camera mug anytime a scene seems to be falling flat theres a point where she is no longer a character but a kooky gag wing is mostly just filling a suit and ogling hemsworth which is a shame considering her immense subtle comedic capabilities and mccarthy seems a little hamstrung in this reserved characterization i have very little doubt that she is more than capable of the earnest nerdom she is meant to represent but without any real quite moment the movie fails to let us fall in love with her  applause has been given to hemsworths portrayal of a braindead receptionist its sometimes funny but not very compelling we get that hes meant to represent a role reversal and thats funny on the surface he plays it well and earnestly but hes so dumb it loses credibility which speaks to the overall problem with the film at no point does it ever establish any reality to ground itself the supporting cast almost to a member is more or less a cartoon version of a character no one behaves like a real person so our main cast has no baseline to ground their otherwise kooky beliefs every interaction they have with the denizens of new york involves more or less selfaware people playing for the joke its so many people trying to yuck it up that the comedy doesnt have a base to stand on from the moment the otherwise excellent zach woods gives his tongueincheek tour guide monologue about a mansion complete with face bidet and antiirish fence you get the sense the movie is more interested in cheap semifunny one liner comedy than in setting up a believable world for the unbelievable to play in you feel like you are watching a parody of a movie rather than the movie itself its just not willing to commit  this is especially apparent in the introduction of the old cast all of whom require the story and plot to come to a halt to allow their entrance bill murray shows up in the middle to stall the story without any introduction of a new element to drive us forward the same with ackroyds third act cameo the least offensive of these is annie potts who has a nice moment before the cast meet our baddie  that brings us to neil casey confession i love neil casey having seen him on stage numerous times i think hes one of the most fun and intelligent improvisers ive ever seen this role is a complete miscast and waste of his talents hes trying his absolute best to make it work but the deranged super nerd who gives plot exposition to himself in the mirror and plans to make new york pay by releasing ghosts should have never made it out of the first draft we spend plenty of time with him cutting away from our main cast to do so but we never exactly understand the motivations for why he does what he does left with the understanding that the world spurned him the mistake here is actually giving this story way too much time it distracts from the development of our buddy relationships and the presentation is so silly that you cant take it seriously hes another cartoon when compared to the slow building dread and malevolence of gozer presented in the original this may be one of the biggest failures of the movies narrative for a movie about the end of the world there are no stakes  allinall the production design of the movie works well enough even the much derided special effects are fine upgrades they are however heavily overused in the finale leaving us with a cotton candy montage of lights and fog that feels like they are fighting in a disco cloud the look of the movie is also a miss the whole film has a prime time sitcom appearance that doesnt enhance the story its telling this certainly cant be the fault of robert yeoman cinematographer who has delivered fantastic work with wes anderson but here he seems hamstrung  some have claimed the movie is scarier than the original thats a very hard sell the film has some really good effects and they actually murder people but it never even comes close to the original in terms of tone the dana barrett armchair scene alone gave me night terrors ghostbusters 2016s best moment may be a creepy use of mannequins that never quite slows down enough to let itself be truly scary it just never sticks the tone  as for pacing you keep hoping that a scene will take a breath long enough to deliver a real feeling or emotion along the way for a movie about four people coming together to form a team i never once got a real heartfelt conversation that made me think these people were making a genuine connection the problem is that there are so many moving pieces in the movie that it doesnt have the real estate to spare i kept wishing feig had rewatched his own bridesmaids to learn relationships and pacing or wishing hed paid attention to how pivotal the sigourney weaver and ernie hudson roles were to the original as touchstones for real noncomic characters who ground the story feig seems terrified of even attempting that kind of work but its essential to creating good comedy and storytelling as a whole  the best parts of the movie are those spent with the team just talking being people however they are few and far between all of these characters and the actors behind them are very likable i just wish the creatives had trusted them more to carry the movie or trusted in the movie they were making instead were left with a movie without stakes and comedy doesnt really work if there arent stakes you can punch a guy in the dick but if it doesnt hurt then it has no meaning i feel like the unfortunate culprit here is improv full disclosure i love improv i often go to three or four shows a week at ucb however improv is no substitute for real written characters who are true to themselves no matter the scene the trend now days in comedy is to sacrifice the work of writing for actor improv to help carry the movie while it generates some good oneliners and bits it can take the scene into a new and unhelpful direction leaving us with a much broader and less grounded piece of work this happens a lot in ghostbusters 2016 its a great tool which has become an unfortunate crutch you have to have a consistent guiding hand  when the movie finally ends we are left with a scene of the cast looking out onto the grateful city and mccarthy remarks well its not terrible its almost a desperate plea to walk away from the movie with the same sentiment and maybe its not terrible but that doesnt mean its particularly good  at the end of the day the gender of these ghostbusters has nothing to do with the way their story is told and that may be its greatest triumph mediocrity knows no gender politics to all misogynists id say this movie does not vindicate you nor should it youre an asshole but to those championing gender equality and more meaningful roles for women id say dont make this your alamo
Jul 17 2016,positive,i thought it was pretty good entertaining and some awesome effects
Jul 17 2016,positive,solid chuckles throughout cool effects different type of comedy than the original some odd editing cuts that are jarring
Jul 17 2016,positive,so funny a bunch of misogynists are making the audience rating low on this movie but its just as good as the original if you can ignore or enjoy the rehashed plot line when else have you seen 4 smart funny women lead a movie and not be sexualized
Jul 17 2016,negative,horribly insulting remake to the originals if i could unwatch it iwould save yourtimeand money and watch something else anything else
Jul 17 2016,negative,this would be a lot different if the jokes were funny there were some funny moments but overall cheesy
Jul 17 2016,positive,really funny and entertaining early internet buzz was way off
Jul 17 2016,positive,loved it  i thought it was great  you definitely want to see this in imax 3d  very funny movie  there was one part toward the end i thought was a little bit of cheese you will see what i mean but that wasnt enough for me not to love it  the girls were hilarious  almost didnt see it because of all the bad reviews before it even came out so glad i didnt listen  go see it
Jul 17 2016,positive,it was a fun and funny movie and i have no problems with it being a remakethese girls know how to be funny and they seem to have good chemistry  kate mckinnon was hilarious but they all had their moments i also loved the cameos throughout all of them im glad to have seen both movies in the theater and enjoyed them both
Jul 17 2016,positive,super funny and entertaining
Jul 17 2016,negative,how horrible for melissa mccarthy to be involved with such a stinker      they did bi justice to the original  what a horrible shame of a movie  save your money but more importantly save your time
Jul 17 2016,positive,great cast jones mckinnon shine especially does a good job at standing on its own
Jul 17 2016,negative,i saw this movie and it sucked so bad im not even going to buy it on dvd the comedy was ok the ghost were good the cameos suckd i think the lion king was better than this shitty ass movie at least that movie made sense it has passion great characters and it has heart sorry ghostbuster fans go with the originals
Jul 17 2016,positive,absolutely hysterical movie i loved the cast i definitely had my doubts but it was terrific
Jul 17 2016,positive,this movie was laughoutloud funny i loved it
Jul 17 2016,positive,not as laughoutloud funny as the original but plenty funny enough the four leads are truly excellent although kate mckinnon stole the show for me chris hemsworth as the classic dumb blond is fantastic well worth seeing lots of fun
Jul 17 2016,negative,dont waste your money on this film its pretty awful and its all about the writing ghostbusters 2016 is a nonsensical mess with racist stereotypes horrible cgi and a plot that makes about as much sense as tommy wiseaus the room rent this when it comes out on blu ray after an all night drinking binge
Jul 17 2016,negative,so disappointed with this movie i want my money back the original is 100 better than this one wait to see it on dvd dont waste your money and time
Jul 17 2016,positive,i loved the original so was a little concerned when this was announced however i thought id give it a chance im so glad i did holtzmann mckinnon is by far my new favourite character she is just this very joyous confident character whos also funny as hell i thought it started a little slow but once the film got moving it was incredibly fun to watch the laserpistol scene alone would have sold it to me     i know some have complained it seems a little crass but i had no problem it was kind of refreshing to see women acting this way because we do also do those complaining not remember the ghost blow job dream sequence from the original if you want to talk crass    the whole cast did a great job and the cameos were sweet  very much looking forward to a sequel if you stayed until literally the very end of the film for the postcredits scene you know what i mean and why im so excited
Jul 17 2016,neutral,in 1984 a little film called ghostbusters took the world by storm it spawned a sequel in 1989 and thus a franchise was born ranging from merchandising to all sorts or media now there is a rebootremake and everyone is upset about it mostly because of the choice of having the cast being female as well as the fact that no one wanted a remakereboot in the first place but now that the film is out whats the final word on the subject its okay its not bad but its not good either this new ghostbusters film is average with some good qualities to it but nothing can compare to the original film that stated it all    the plot involves three women erin gilbert kristen wiig abby yates melissa mccarthy and jillian holtzmann kate mckinnon who study the paranormal after posting some videos online to which the users think theyre fake the trio decide to capture ghosts themselves to provide some proof to the matter accompanying them is patty leslie jones who knows new york city the quartet of women decide to hunt ghosts and prove their existence to the public but what they discover might lead to the end of the world    ghostbusters is not terrible but its also not great its somewhere in the middle lets start off with whats good first for one thing the cast is good as they work off each other very well and their chemistry together isnt bad plus we do get some cameos from the original film in some hilarious ways the orchestrated score by theodore shapiro is good as well even though the hard rock can get in the way even the ghostbusters theme song has a catchy remix to it the special effects definitely look like something out of a computer but the designs of the ghosts look creative and inventive and the final battle is pretty exciting but thats pretty much it when it comes to the good things about this movie    the story on the other hand is pretty weak and uninspiring sure there are some good things like the women testing out the equipment before using them but nothing is funny or humorous in the slightest some jokes work but for the most part they dont which transitions to the pacing of the film being incredibly slow and makes the viewer wish for something exciting to happen granted when something does happen its usually predictable and boring and then there are the characters while this new cast is doing a good job the characters do feel a bit uninteresting especially the villain who is not that threatening there could have been some major changes before the final product was delivered unto the public    in conclusion while this new ghostbusters isnt the worst its not the best either the original from 1984 is a good example of what to do with a respectable film and follow it up this isnt a good follow up
Jul 17 2016,positive,this movie was incredible much better than any of the originals it had scares no one was over sexualized except for kevin which its about time for a dude to play that part and we had a cannon lesbian character who was comfortable in her own weirdness the geeky guy never got the girl and it was perfect for its target audience people who arent misogynistic pricks that are obsessed with putting down everything women do or enjoy if you have the time and money i really do suggest seeing it because i fell in love right away
Jul 17 2016,positive,i laughed the whole way through i really loved this movie
Jul 17 2016,positive,this movie was really great i enjoyed myself a lot i feel like it  was really good remake from the original and i highly recommend watching it
Jul 17 2016,positive,ghostbusters was amazing perfect reboot fantastic homage while also having many original qualities a
Jul 17 2016,positive,its worth seeing  dont listen to the naysayers  the cast is excellent
Jul 17 2016,positive,im sorry but i enjoyed the movie the actors were all quite funny i love movies like this everyone wanted it to be like the original but im sorry im a ghost buster fan as well but this upgrade has blown the old one out the water sure in the old version they all were so serious in that one but thats what the new generation wants now are movies they will keep their attention not seriousness all the time i loved it and it give i 2 thumbs up 
Jul 17 2016,positive,arguably better than the original  kate mckinnon just hit the big time by stealing every scene she was in  the entire cast was great  it was great to see that chris hemsworth has some great comedic chops
Jul 17 2016,positive,ghostbusters is rad the girls are amazeballs doing great honor to the original if you dont see it because youre stuck on nostalgia youre missing out on a good time for the new generation of bustin
Jul 17 2016,negative,it wasnt as bad as the first trailer had me thinking but it is still awful a lot of the jokes you saw in the trailer you knew were coming the writing was terrible and all of the men in this movie are either stupid or evil  chris hemsworth you poor poor man  you could tell he was trying to act better than the material he was given the big evil guy at the end was pathetic in ending its not as bad as i thought it was going to be but its far from anything good im glad i didnt waste my money on this i give it a d
Jul 17 2016,positive,not sure why its getting so a low rating  its a fun summer popcorn movie the holtzman character stole the movie
Jul 17 2016,positive,silly scary fun  forget the critics forget any kind of blind nerd rage you might have and enjoy 2 hours of a good movie  does it beat the original no but as a reboot its also not trying to be the original the nods and cameos were awesome touching and hilarious the four main women are not crossgendered versions of the originals they are their own characters  and let me say patty holtzmann and kevin steal it all funny and quirky in their own ways
Jul 17 2016,negative,a hollow representation of what was
Jul 17 2016,positive,no its not better than the original but that doesnt mean it isnt any good the four leads are fun to watch and the natural rhythm set up by these comedictrained vets makes their banter seem effortless a pleasant comedic surprise is chris hemsworth whose airhead kevin can seem to do no wrong because of his hotness still the cameos seem to have more weight than the actual story which doesnt have the sense of apocalyptic urgency that the original did heres hoping that the sequel will be a bit more fun
Jul 17 2016,positive,better than expected
Jul 17 2016,negative,how sad guys they had to pay u off just to give this movie a good rating now i know i cant trust this site ever again
Jul 17 2016,negative,given the terrible marketing for this film and the way everyone who worked on the film to those who supported it insulted everyone who had concerns i had no emotion toward this film at all except distaste  which makes me a misogynist i suppose  so coming out of it well it wasnt the bomb i was rather expecting but that does not make it good  at all    so the cgi wasnt as annoying as i thought it was going to be and leslie jones who i thought was going to be the worst character actually wasnt and had the one good joke that i actually remember and laughing at  if anything she was surprisingly the most entertaining of the four despite the couple scenes she is shown in the trailers  that pretty much covers the positive    the rest was rather forgettable or just plain bad  melissa mccarthy and kirstin wiig played uninteresting comedic goofy roles that really didnt hold my attention but kate mckinnon was a cartoon i dont know if she was a character from the same movie given her overacting and antics on screen that got close to the absurd  chris hemsworth was especially cringy as the stupid receptionist who was simply unbelievable that he could survive into adulthood and not earn himself a darwin award long since  the main cast and the supporting cast just felt like being there for joke setups like an overlong snl sketch  nothing makes any sense not the story not the characters  oh and the villain  what a disappointment that was a whiny nerd who doesnt like he was made fun of  really makes it hard to object that this film isnt feminist propaganda really the female leads are strong smart capable women while the men are anywhere from dumb to pathetic to being an outright asshole  i guess it makes paul feig feel better about being a white man to trash his gender by not having a single respectable male in the entire film  girl power yay  plus a ridiculous climax and a cable of infinite length  fantastic right    really the original trailer gave a perfect encapsulation of the film as a whole while i didnt hate it as much as i thought i would have more of a meh then making me facepalm continually  anyone who thought the trailer was worth thumbing down on youtube i doubt is going to have their mind changed here  i suppose if someone doesnt mind every scene seeming to be a setup to a joke later on or that several plotpoints dont make sense just how does kate mckinnon keep making that ghost crap with no money and no time or if you dont mind that this reboot takes many of the beats from the first film and plops them here  while it was tolerable in something like force awakens its not here as star wars vii was you know actually an entertaining film  ghostbusters 2016 was just mediocrity followed by cringe followed by feminist talking points followed by some more cringe and silly action that includes very little actual ghostbusting  try not to pay money for this will only encourage sony to make another of these things
Jul 17 2016,positive,honestly i fully enjoyed this film its a great comedy its a great action movie the cast is awesome i say cast because everyone was great not just the lead female casts id say if you enjoy bridesmaids youd appreciate the humor and if you enjoyed the original ghostbusters youll enjoy this film as well as the writers have said this film is a love letter to the original one i definitely agree with that aspect bad trailers and attitudes doesnt take away the fact that this is a well made and fun movie
Jul 17 2016,negative,how about making something original thats right hollywood you cant whats next et
Jul 17 2016,positive,so i got a question for ya do you think the worst idea can change that  every bad idea can be good if they just try well ghostbusters did just that
Jul 17 2016,positive,the first 13 of the movie was slow but it picked up the pace later it really isnt anywhere nearly as bad as everyone is saying the movie is worth seeing
Jul 17 2016,positive,im a 40yo guy whose favorite movie is the original ghostbusters i dont know who all these haters are but they dont represent anyone i know their claims that the new movie is sexist and racist are contradicted by the movie itself which is neither rather it seems that these haters living in their moms basements are just saying nyuhuh you are when confronted with their blatant misogyny and racism directed toward this movie the poor trailers have been used by these people to cover up their true agenda but now people are seeing for themselves that the new movie while not the classic that the original is is still a great supernatural comedy with chills and thrills it doesnt ruin the original any more than ghostbusters ii did and is a lot better than that movie im looking forward to more
Jul 17 2016,positive,i love the original ghostbusters it has an amazing cast and with a hilarious script  i truthfully was skeptical of the remake but i was pleasantly surprised it is a solid remake it has nods to the original while making its own solid story  having said that the original ghostbusters is iconic and anyone who is expecting this movie to do the same is going to be disappointed if you truly love the original no remake male or female cast will ever compare if you want proof even the original cast could not make another movie as good as the original look at ghostbusters 2    but if you want to see an entertaining summer movie that is funny with some exciting action sequences this movie is for you
Jul 17 2016,negative,should have just spent a couple more years in writing and rebooted it on the 30th anniversary of the first film
Jul 17 2016,negative,it felt like we were watching a long skit on snl mediocre acting unfunny jokes and sad cameos from the original cast i was so looking forward to this version but it was a waste of time and money
Jul 17 2016,negative,weak script too many winks to the old one and just not very good
Jul 17 2016,positive,we went and saw ghostbusters tonight i dont know what the negative fuss is all about it was an entertaining laugh out loud funny movie with cameos from the actors in original ghostbusters i highly recommend it i didnt waste my time trying to compare every detail to the original but instead watched it as a fresh moviestory and really liked it 2 thumbs up
Jul 17 2016,positive,the movie was amazing an funny
Jul 17 2016,negative,derivative and tired to busy cringing to laugh at the movie
Jul 17 2016,positive,heres the deal ghostbusters 2016 was hilarious and a lot of freakin fun
Jul 17 2016,positive,fun movie did some things better than the original there were some unnecessary scenes but overall was worth the 13 i look forward to a sequel
Jul 17 2016,positive,i thought this movie was very well written and the cast portrayed the characters extremely well you can not go into this movie expecting it to be like the original the original ghostbusters will never be topped they have basically taken the ghostbusters concept and created a new era of ghostbusters they also do a great job in paying homage to the original cast via cameos from all of them they have a lot of cool new gadgets and the special effects in this film is just flat out awesome be sure to stay through the entire credits for a big hint of what is for sure to come
Jul 17 2016,positive,forget the first two and leave your expectations at home this is a reboot and a darn good one at that comparatively speaking it stands on its own and had me laughing all the way through it  the pros far outweigh the cons so ignore the haters they wouldnt have been happy with anything anyway
Jul 17 2016,positive,light  funny kate mckinnons performance was off the chain worth seeing for this alone  melissa mccarthy can make nothing seem funny  just hearing her voice makes me crack up kristen wiig perfect for the part  the mta worker turned gb was great it was awesome seeing female ghostbusters and cameos by some of the original ghostbusters
Jul 17 2016,positive,just okay movie funny but not interesting
Jul 17 2016,positive,we really enjoyed the movie
Jul 17 2016,negative,the new ghostbusters film makes ghostbusters 2 looke like ghostbusters 1 while the ladies are funny in other projects it is chris helmsworth that saves the show
Jul 17 2016,positive,i went to see this despite all the nerd rage online thoroughly enjoyed it just as good as the original in my honest opinion ghostbusters 1984 was never a masterpiece it was great fun though and gave a few laughs and so is this it brought back a much nostalgia from my childhood 
Jul 17 2016,negative,ghostbusters2016pg13july 15  byclem the movie guy    one of my favorite comedies is the original 1984 ghostbusters now thirtytwo years later comes this new reboot starring kristen wiig melissa mccarthy kate mckinnon  leslie jones hoping to prove that ghosts live among us dr abby yates melissa mccarthy  dr erin gilbert kristen wiig collaborate on a book which unfortunately is not widely read or wellreceived they go their separate ways but a few years later while teaching at columbia erin is shocked to find copies of the book surfacing her former collaborator abby is still trying to prove her theories now with the assistance of dr jillian holtzmann kate mckinnon abby agrees to pull the embarrassing book back out of publication if erin will join her  jillian on a paranormal investigation leslie jones completes the quartet as former subway worker with some technology chops patty tolen ghostbusters is directed by paul feig who cowrote the script with katie dippold unlike the original which was wellbalanced in its plot smart  funny with plenty of spooky ghouls the remake relies too much on lame sexual innuendos overthe top acting  special effects to propel the story the performances from the cast which includes chris helmsworth as the idiot secretary  andy garcia as mayor bradley were boring  uninspired i expected more from this movie  i was hugely disappointed i was also disappointed that the original cast members agreed to the cameos throughout the film although there may be fans who enjoy this there is a post credit scene that sets up a potential sequel which might be the scariest aspect of the new ghostbusters fans of the four comedians can call on the ghostbusters in 2d 3d and imax 3d but fans of the classic original should wait for dvd
Jul 17 2016,negative,horrible remake the crazy screamer leslie jones makes every scene she is in cringeworthy the laughs are hard to come by and most of the humor is just plain dumb
Jul 17 2016,positive,loved it kate mckinnon was everything
Jul 17 2016,positive,ghostbusters was hilarious i laughed pretty much the whole time i had heard such negative reviews beforehand so was expecting notsogreat and was definitely happy that the reviews were totally bogus if youre on the fence just watch it youll be happy you did
Jul 17 2016,positive,i understand some disappointment this is a reboot not a continuation i had hoped it to be a continuation of the original ghostbusters with new characters maybe one of them the daughter of egon however this was made in memory of egon with everyones approval i admit i did not like reinventing the wheel but once i accepted the premise of the film i did enjoy it and likely will watch it again i look forward to the next one
Jul 17 2016,negative,what was all the fuss about
Jul 17 2016,negative,i was originally skeptical but a couple reviewers i knew liked it so i gave it a shot  i shouldnt have gone too much dumb toilet humor and slapstick
Jul 17 2016,positive,i went into the movie with zero expectations because these type of movies can be unbelievably terrible or surprise you i must admit i was pleasantly surprised it was funny the cast worked very well together and i loved seeing all the cameos
Jul 17 2016,positive,i enjoyed this movie a lot i was very glad not all the funny parts were just in the previews
Jul 17 2016,positive,great movie   funny actionpacked paid respects to the original castcharacters and able to stand on its own   loved it
Jul 17 2016,positive,i saw the movie opening night i really enjoyed the remake super funny characters  kate mackinnon was incredible the story paid homage to the original and it was great to see the original cast the ghost scenes were better than the original ill see it again
Jul 17 2016,negative,awful writing and i do mean awful  its nickelodeon combined with a bad snl skit  short simple sentences target a 58 year audience  i havent seen a movie this bad in yearswalked out after 15 minutesit was that bad    kristin wiig really pulled the short straw on this onejust terrible
Jul 17 2016,positive,i loved this movie   i loved the original  too  i thought that this movie did a great job of respecting and nodding toward the original while still adding something new and relevant  it was funny had great effects and wellacted  well worth it
Jul 17 2016,positive,this movie is amazing i havent laughed so much in a cinema in a long time
Jul 17 2016,positive,hilarious and entertaining  mckinnon was incredible
Jul 17 2016,positive,solid comedy with great character chemistry  interestingly the jokes seemed to appeal to different individuals in the audience  i found myself and some but not all of the crowd belly laughing at some jokes  while a different gag would tickle others but not me  but regardless there was plenty to enjoy  especially kate mckinnon  it was obvious she was having a blast playing jillian the quirky gadget guru
Jul 17 2016,negative,cliche poorly written terrible animation that felt miles away from the rest ghostbusters franchise and tons of unintended hopefully cringe despite the admirable efforts of the cast the movie crashed and burned
Jul 17 2016,neutral,not a terrible movie just somewhat meh    ill start with the good i actually think the visual effects were really cool i didnt see the film in imax 3d but did enjoy the vibrant colors and the look of the ghosts     casting was good although it felt a little underutilized chris hemsworth was the best of the bunch but mccarthy and wiig both fell sort of flat  mckinnon and leslie jones outshine both of them i cant help but to think all of this could have been handled better    the plot is essentially a mix of the first two original movies nothing groundbreaking there are nice nods to the original including some cameos but again these sort of fall flat     stick with the original
Jul 17 2016,positive,ever since that first trailer came out people and fans have been ragging on paul feiges modern take on the classic 80s franchise from the lavish effects to the four female leads and the subpar comedy writing   well now that the movie is officially here its not the godawful trainwreck we were meant to believe  the film still has its merits but not without a few faults of its own to go with the four leads mccarthy wiig jones and mckinnon are gold together the effects are passable despite looking very cartoonish theres cute cameos by the old cast members and the climax is my fav part when so many ghosts are busting out  sadly chris hemsworth as the dimwitted receptionist gets old so quick theres so many comparisons to the original movie its unavoidable and a lot of the humor doesnt always hit the mark  it might feel like a bad snl skit a lot of the time and some people may still have to adjust to this new approach but overall women can be funny in hollywood and still carry a brand such as this in a modern era of progressivism  its a new ghostbusters for this generation so toss out the hate
Jul 17 2016,positive,this is not my ghostbusters  and that is a good thing  if you dont go into the movie with your head stuck in a deep body cavity you can be entertained greatly  is it a crazy intelligent movie  no   are there many funny moments that make you laugh   yes  go and enjoy this movie for what it is and entertaining comedy with some nostalgic links to the past
Jul 17 2016,negative,the movie was disrespectful to the original but was not as bad as what i believed it would be after watching trailer it was disrespectful to men with all men in the movie being stupid a pro women propaganda with typed cast actors was very annoying it had cheap easy unintelligent humor not a good time
Jul 17 2016,positive,movie was awesome it doesnt try and beat the original they pay their respects and for me that was great well done and hope people stop disliking this movie
Jul 17 2016,positive,it wasnt a masterpiece however it was very funny and definitely entertaining the cast did a great job of establishing themselves as totally unique characters rather than just femsle copies of the og cast
Jul 17 2016,positive,i loved it thought it was fun and entertaining
Jul 17 2016,positive,it really is a lot of fun with a great cast who work wonderfully together id have preferred a little more comedy but i guess everyone was restrained by the pg13 rating
Jul 17 2016,positive,that was effing hilarious  holtzmannso amazing
Jul 17 2016,positive,laugh out loud funny they added all the classic elements organically the cameos were spot on i loved it definitely seeing it again
Jul 17 2016,positive,unexpected laughter everyone should see itthe 8yearold kid next to us was a huge ghostbusters fan and he loved it 8yearolds know their stuff and chris hemsworth yeah chris hemsworth
Jul 17 2016,positive,although not my favorite summer movie this year it was actually a pleasant surprise  i think the all staring female cast was a nice refreshing change  stay until the last of the credits to see a few seconds of extra footage
Jul 17 2016,negative,id give it zero stars if i could
Jul 17 2016,positive,it was a great movie people need to stop whining about feminazis oppressing them 
Jul 17 2016,positive,so unlike many of the whiny boys on this and other websites i actually went to see the movie it was great it was funny action packed and all around awesome mckinnon kicked all kinds of ass and the whole cast had amazing chemistry hard to tell if it surpasses the original but it is definitely better than ghostbusters 2 i challenge any of these naysayers to actually go and watch the damn movie and come back with specific and defendable examples of things you didnt like dont just fart out the jokes werent funny or the cast sucks its not perfect but it is a lot of fun and a great actioncomedy movie
Jul 17 2016,positive,i had so much fun watching this movie im in love with all the ladies jokes and how this movie looks those ghosts are just beautiful
Jul 17 2016,positive,so much fun very lovingly referential to the original but stands on its own two feet dare i say this is what a reboot should be
Jul 17 2016,negative,worst film in years why even bother naming it ghostbusters it just adds to the disappointment of this piece of crap movie
Jul 17 2016,negative,if i could give it zero stars i would
Jul 17 2016,positive,this movie was amazingcallbacks to the original were perfectly woven with new plot lines and comedy all of the actresses delivered lines very well and comedic and the satireirony was extremely well done 1210 would recommend
Jul 17 2016,positive,definitely enjoyable different than the first had some really scary parts
Jul 17 2016,negative,i really really wanted to like this movie  i love leslie jones and kate mckinnon  i am female and have no problem with an all female team  first of all it wasnt funny  the pacing is off  the characters did not gel the story was forced   just everything was wrong and off  poor writing   1 star for great visuals
Jul 17 2016,positive,my childhood is    intact  i really tried ignoring all the naysayers and negative comments from the haters mostly all the negative comments are from people who havent seen the film and i walked in with an open mind  the move was fun the cameos were joyful and the imax 3d experience was on point this is how 3d should work everyone involved obviously had so much fun making this film and that energy comes across on screen  it was a truly funny film which does a great job paying tribute to its predecessor whenever it can and i would watch it again
Jul 17 2016,positive,absolutely loved it the villain could have used a bit more work but overall i thought it was very funny and well written
Jul 17 2016,positive,four hilarious badass women taking down ghost wreaking havoc on nyc yes please and thank you for this happening dont listen to all of the people that refused to see it because of their loyalty to the original because theyre fools this movie is its own with respectful and fantastic nods to the original also see this movie if you believe women can in fact lead a blockbuster comedy
Jul 17 2016,positive,just go watch it and stop whining about your childhood
Jul 17 2016,positive,i dont feel the hate that this movie received before its release was justified was it a great movie no i wouldnt say so was it mindless fun with a lot of laughs and good memories absolutely as a lover of the original films i can truly say i enjoyed watching the 2016 edition a lot
Jul 17 2016,positive,great film love the female power
Jul 17 2016,negative,i feel like i died on the inside after this
Jul 17 2016,positive,not  a remake but stand alone inspired by wonderfully funny
Jul 17 2016,negative,horrible movie id rather watch paint dry than have to sit through this atrocity again
Jul 17 2016,positive,the original was so loved that no movie can compare with it in order for this movie to even stand half a chance you must judge it on its own merit good cast original storyline cameo from the original cast scary moments and even great action this film holds its own even if it doesnt have the privilege of being the first to be called ghostbusters it still carries the title into the modern age
Jul 17 2016,negative,after seeing the movie rt clearly felt the pressure of social justice warriors everywhere and gave this movie a much higher rating that it deserved  in summary the movie is complete garbage and should have never been made
Jul 17 2016,positive,better than i expected  not great but entertaining enough  i did love chris hemsworth as kevin the secretaryand enjoyed his dance while the credits rolled
Jul 17 2016,negative,girls shouldnt be ghostbusters
Jul 17 2016,positive,funny reboot to a classic  i dont know what all the controversy was about its just a funny movie
Jul 17 2016,positive,kate mckinnon is my lesbian princess
Jul 17 2016,positive,this movie exceeded my expectations lots of humor good effects a great cast chemistry i am ready for sequels and ill be seeing it again stay for the after credits scene
Jul 17 2016,negative,a mediocre movie based on unspecial effects and very bad direction    people without sense of humor fail at making humor they copy jokes made by funny people but not getting it so they turn the punchline into just being a jerk dumb pathetic obvious or boring    thats the feeling from this movie people screaming make you feel bad instead of making you laugh people acting dumb make you think of a bad actor just faking it instead of laughing at his lack of awareness of something important    it has a kitsch feel like some bollywood movies    i dont blame the actors any actor makes some good and bad performances on any movie but the director is the one who should cut the bad parts or film them again     all the fat should had been cut by the director hes the one to blame  i dont remember a single good scene it was all amateur filmaking like a teen being dumb and acting silly just to try to get your attention but just turning fake and repulsive
Jul 17 2016,positive,i went to this after reading the reviews not expecting much  maybe thats why i liked it so much lots of laughs fun seeing the cameos from all of the old cast great effects not sure why people are being negative i dont think anyone would be disappointed  i thoroughly enjoyed it dont run out  stay for the credits
Jul 17 2016,positive,new movie is funny and fun must see and a great reboot to a beloved franchise
Jul 17 2016,positive,great movie funny with some pretty scary moments and some great action i couldnt be happier with this movie
Jul 17 2016,positive,this reboot was as so good the entire crowd at the theater were laughing throughout the movie well done
Jul 17 2016,negative,horrible writing i felt bad for all the actresses because i feel like they did the best they could with what they were given story made no sense jokes werent funnt and by the end the stupidity of the characters got very annoying save your money
Jul 17 2016,negative,terrible the worst film ive seen in years
Jul 17 2016,positive,i agree it was very funny movie but the kevin character was more of a detractor from the story line also the storyline with the mayor was over acted and did not add to the overall
Jul 17 2016,positive,fantastic buddy comedyscifi action film real chemistry among the four actors with a particularly nice relationship between wiig and mccarthy entertaining cameos from many of the original ghostbusters actors adding to the nostalgia factor for the grownups mckinnon as the crazy genius engineer was both funny and charismatic jones as the nonscientist realist was funny and not playing a stereotype great special effects see it
Jul 17 2016,positive,i cant believe how critical everyone is being about this movie  i read some reviews before i went to see it and was prepared for a disappointment  was i ever surprised  this show is a remake so there wont be a lot of new stuff i am old enough to know there are very few newideas in movies anymore  almost all are a remake or similar to previous movies  i think all the women did an excellent job i liked how all the characters worked together no one tried to outdo the other chris hemsworth was great  and kate mckinnon was so funny  i was around for the first ghostbusters and have to say i think i like this one better    i think they did a good job with the remake   go see it  it is fun
Jul 17 2016,positive,i loved the originalsi hated the hideous trailersi feared it would reuin the originals  its good laugh out loud quite a lot good very enjoyable anf entertaining and the cameos from the original cast add to the humor chris hemsworth is funny and the movie taking the piss of him and that character works stay through the credits little bit at the end they did a great job and the acting and writing is good not at all how the trailers make it look with not funny crap fall flat shit  it works i had such little hope and now i want a sequel i hope the misogynistic jurks get over themselves its funny
Jul 17 2016,positive,well this didnt totally suck it probably would of been a whole lot better if wiig wasnt in it chris hemsworth and kate mckinnon made this movie worth watching
Jul 17 2016,positive,a fun summer movie with good laughs enjoyed it thoroughly
Jul 17 2016,positive,hilarious and entertaining  we laughed all the way through  to me  its better than the original
Jul 17 2016,positive,saw the first two trailers  was very nervous just like everyone   but after seeing it i have the following feeling on the movie   it was great   i never felt i was watching 4 women only four actors    even with all the gadgets i didnt really feel like they were just pushing marketable merchandise    the story was fun   and the biggie it really wasnt a sequel nor a reboot  it really was just a different universe that gave acknowledgment to the fact that theyre standing on the shoulders of an already near perfect movie  non of the tiein nods to he 1984 movie felt forced  they were just there  seemed to fit      i really thought it was well done  cannot wait for ghostbusters 20 part 2 
Jul 17 2016,negative,this movie pops to life a couple times the jerky twitches of a corpse shocked by a mad not genius scientist in the hopes of bringing it back to life   shame on snl shame on hollywood shame on the original cast shame on the director cinematographer shame in spades    honestly im sad that i got sucked into seeing this the humor was mostly flat and not delivered well the cast clearly seems to have been told alright ladies come up with what you think is a pithy line then well have some special effects rinse repeat    it suffers from phantom menace syndrome where the actresses clearly couldnt see half of what they were working with while delivering their mostly uninspired lines  holtzman has some truly funny moments the kinds of stuff she better be in more movies with fist shake at hollywood but the rest of the cast good lord theyre predictable cardboard cutouts the villain is just so cheesy it feels like this movie is suffering from comicbook movie disease where were supposed to feel ironic about a bunch of it meh    there were a couple of mild scares and creepy ideas but none of it brings together a cohesive consistent feeling that pulled me into and through the length of the film the characters seemed to have well very little of it there was nonsensical plot development and nearly zero tension throughout the entirety of this snore    oh and the camera shots hang shoot dismember the cinematographer yes thats two exclamation marks  who was that yahoo anyway shudder i know you learned at hollywood school but come on buddy     in all this movie gets more and more disappointing as it rolls along it builds you up in some scenes thinking wow this could be neat and then musters almost no excitement before cutting abruptly to the next scene    the ending before resolution nearly the entire audience audibly began to murmur in confusion and disgust    the stale offal icing on this shit  cake you marketing shillweaselfuckers destroyed the villains climax of the movie cutting out possibly the single funniest moment in order to show it to the audience in pieces in the credits to  sell more dvds as an extended version   people audibly went huh at this marketing execs im glad you chopped up a bad movie to try and sell more copies later and not a good movie at least    if the ghost of harold ramis comes back to haunt us for this these gals likely  wont be the ones anybody calls      i feel as though ive been slimed
Jul 17 2016,negative,feigs sophomoric writing and directing style comes to an ugly head with this film leslie jones and melissa mccarthy get two thumbs down kristen wiig and kate mckinnon were the only decent ones
Jul 17 2016,positive,i laughed i gasped i had a great time and the fun keeps rolling through the credits
Jul 17 2016,positive,if you liked bridesmaids and spy you will love this movie  takes the best parts of the original without being derivative unique characters and great writing
Jul 17 2016,negative,the special effects are fine and the cast does they they can but ultimately the film collapses due to the one unforgivable sin in any comedy they forgot to bring the funny
Jul 17 2016,negative,caricatures of stereotypes bad plotline toilet humor yet another awful remake of an older franchise
Jul 17 2016,positive,this was a truly enjoyable movie very much in the spirit of the original
Jul 17 2016,positive,this movie is a gem in my opinion its funny and represents realistic girls all of the four main characters were balanced beautifully and if these girls had any more chemistry togwther theyd be in a polygamous relationship the cameos and easter eggs were funny and cute and only added to the movies success i only have 2 qualms with the movie 1 the white hair at the end seemed rushed and unnecessary though what they did later on with the outcome is funny and 2 i thought the large ringmaster ghost was awkward and also unnecessary but it will work out for the video game thats bound to come out overall 10 out of 10 would recommend
Jul 17 2016,positive,loved it  corny but not a corny sequel
Jul 17 2016,negative,dont see it unless your punishing someone for being bad even then that might be to much
Jul 17 2016,negative,i walked out i honestly dont give a rotten tomato about the drama surrounding this film but this was the most unimaginative cringe inducing thing i have ever seen ghost busters 1 was good ghost busters 2 was bad this this was just awful the queef joke at the very start of the film describes this situation perfectly awkward and disgusting stop giving money to shameless cash ins like this
Jul 17 2016,positive,i thoght the movie was great tons of laughs it was just a fun movie with a few great homages to the original
Jul 17 2016,positive,this was a fairly funny remake that knew what it is and was very faithful to the original honestly if youre angry because they tried something new then you dont need to watch this cause you probably wont like it
Jul 17 2016,negative,holy shit this was bad 12 is being very generous
Jul 17 2016,positive,perfect summer movie kate mckinnon is hilarious
Jul 17 2016,positive,a fun and entertaining summer blockbuster is what this movie needed to be it it delivers on that front
Jul 17 2016,positive,i laughed till it hurt and i loved every single one of the characters bring on more
Jul 17 2016,positive,i had low expectations after reading the reviews but it turned out to be a cute funny film with lots of cameos and incredible special effects definitely see this in 3d  one of the best applications of 3d ive seen dont expect oscar material just go in to laugh
Jul 17 2016,positive,honestly better than the original dont let sad dudebros turn you off to this its amazingly hilarious with plenty of gratuitous cameos for fans of the 80s version the set up takes a little longer than i wouldve liked and there was a missed opportunity for a pretty epic kiss otherwise theres plenty of cheesy goodness
Jul 17 2016,positive,not a particularly wellmade movie but a fun one with a stellar comedic cast watching kate mckinnon hamming her way to stardom is worth the price of admission alone
Jul 17 2016,positive,better than the original fun funny smart
Jul 17 2016,positive,as a hardcore ghostbusters fan since the first movies came out i was prepared to be disappointed i totally wasnt the film may even exceed the original and i wasnt the only one who thought so the audience actually stood clapped and cheered when the movie ended i am very suspicious of all these negative reviews especially since many of them seem to have been written before the movie even came out  and not by critics anyone who doesnt see this movie is missing out
Jul 17 2016,negative,overall it doesnt compare to original the pacing was bad the special effects were pretty ok and the humor was lacking however kate mckinnon is fantastic she practically saves the movie her acting humor and character are great
Jul 17 2016,negative,ghostbusters sets itself up to be a great film then fails to deliver at every opportunity its like the editor cut out all the good material and just left us with a bland story set in front of an amazing visual effects backdrop
Jul 17 2016,negative,dreadful derivative and dull the acting could only be described as awkward the first act was agonizingly slow and the third felt forced to me on the bright side i got to sit wherever i wanted as the theatre was empty
Jul 17 2016,positive,more of a retelling or reimagining than a remake and that gives it merit in its self feig does a admirable job but i will admit it isnt as downright funny as the original wiig and mccarthy are suited for their roles but mckinnon and jones steal the show and chris hemsworth is stitch as the receptionist feig plays proper homage to the original with clever cameos the special effects are just right and i enjoyed it way more than i may have originally thought i would 07162016
Jul 17 2016,positive,i thought this movie was great i was skeptical about an allfemale reboot but now that ive seen it i cant imagine a better cast
Jul 17 2016,positive,defiantly doesnt deserve the hate its getting i found this absolutely hilarious and am going to watch it again loved the original and love this one as a seperate movie
Jul 17 2016,positive,outstanding havent laughed as much in the cinema in years
Jul 17 2016,positive,i thought the movie was hilarious not sure why so many people are hating on it the actresses all did a good job if you loved the first two ghostbusters movies youll love this one too
Jul 17 2016,positive,a thoroughly enjoyable summer film great cameos that play off the nostalgia aspect of the original but thr movir was given some new flair    wholly more enjoyable to methan  bridesmaids the comedy is there without being all about women the jokes are actually pretty evenly distributed to humor both men and women will enjoy     the discussions of lesley jones being there as a token loud uneducated black woman is false lesley jones is there as lesley jones patty earns her keep on the team by being the most educated on ny history and geography if you love lesley in snl you will love her in this movie    same goes for kate mckinnon easily my favorite character as if i had any doubt jillian is funny smart and weird in the best ways     there was some cheesy campiness
Jul 17 2016,positive,if you are negatively rating ghostbusters without seeing the movie you are the worst kind of media consumer     if you didnt like the movie perhaps you are better off with male comedies such as   superbad the hangover the interview clerks shaun of the dead hot fuzz mallards knocked up neighbors borat jackass back to the future groundhog day caddyshack risky business old school 40 year old virgin coming to america trading places tommy boy black sheep the big lebowski bill and teds excellent adventure monty python and the holy grail the life of brian nacho libre napoleon dynamite tenacious d in the pick of destiny walk hard orange county saving silverman shallow hal step brothers dazed and confused horrible bosses due date south park bigger longer and uncut role models dinner for schmucks pineapple express corky romano bubble boy the naked gun harold and kumar go to white castle the rocker office space the other guys wedding crashers zoolander hot rod blades of glory the producers 2005 austin powers a night at the roxbury happy gilmore billy madison vacation big daddy van wilder out cold the waterboy meet the parents liar liar just friends i now pronounce you chuck and larry major league swingers dodgeball hall pass night at the museum sausage party paul this is the end funny people accepted anchorman i love you man hot tub time machine bruce almighty you dont mess with the zohan drillbit taylor super troopers waynes world half baked 21 jump street 2012 grandmas boy click get him to the greek grown ups the longest yard 2005 dogma beverly hills ninja paul blart mall cop thats my boy deuce bigalow male gigolo anger management mr deeds the animal little nicky joe dirt the wedding singer airheads    this movie was fun and a good time all around i enjoyed it from the beginning to the very very end this is what a summer movie should be
Jul 17 2016,neutral,i was such a huge fan of the original ghostbusters back in the 80s im mostly just glad to see the franchise renewed but i think i would have preferred a sequel to a reboot  i enjoyed it overall but i overlooked a lot of flat jokes and flat characters
Jul 17 2016,positive,really good remake of a classic plenty of tongueincheek references to the original without being too copycat
Jul 17 2016,positive,scary in some bits very funny in some others especially in the beginning and the middle parts the movie falls flat in the last third when cgi overflows out of everything    the holtzmann character is outstanding and thor is has surprisingly good comic timing as an airhead    if there is a sequel ill watch it
Jul 17 2016,negative,if you click on every single reviewer giving a 5 star review on this they either do not exist or have a single reviewthe fact that they are faking reviews is no surprisemovie sucked
Jul 17 2016,positive,infinitely better than so many lacklustre reboots of recent years hugely funny and kate mckinnon was a total delight my cinema was cheering and clapping throughout
Jul 17 2016,positive,not so much a remake but a reboot a homage to the 80s movies but a movie that stands well on its own very funny and well thought out takes time explaining things but sometimes misses a real story line great start of the reboot and lets hope theres more to come
Jul 17 2016,negative,wasnt good worst than the old ones
Jul 17 2016,neutral,all and all i didnt hate it and i really do think todays kids will enjoy it will i add this one to my collection mmmmm probably not
Jul 17 2016,positive,a wonderful movie starring four powerful and intelligent woman who werent needlessly sexualized hilarious and entertaining with spectacular special effects ghostbusters 2016 is a movie that has something for everyone
Jul 17 2016,positive,kate mckinnon and leslie jones were hysterical
Jul 17 2016,negative,if you are interested in a movie where the women roles are cartoon characters and incredible racist stereotypes for black women while every single male role being either stupid or mean and sprinkle in some blatent man hating language  with the only thing taken from the original movie being the name then this piece of trash is for you
Jul 17 2016,negative,while ghostbusters has its funny moments the majority of jokes fall flat and an excellent cast is wasted as onedimensional clichès
Jul 17 2016,positive,hilarious the whole theatre was laughing their heads off a great family movie a movie i can take the kids to see and i loved the cameos
Jul 17 2016,negative,i didnt expect much but i didnt expect to be bored
Jul 17 2016,negative,the jokes were terrible and the cast was utterly unmemorable and its only saving grace was the music awful
Jul 17 2016,positive,i never watched the original as a kid so i dont have the same nostalgia like a lot of other people so that alone makes it easier for me to have an unbiased review of this film my family really really enjoyed this movie the cast comes together really well with tons of chemistry and are absolutely hilarious they do a good job of creating something new while staying very true to the original story its appropriate enough for younger audiences while still having enough adult humor i truly think a lot of the complainers just dont like that it was women in the lead roles because they honesly did everything they could to include the characters and cast from the original please dont let the haters convince you its a terrible movie go and enjoy
Jul 17 2016,positive,most these audience reviews were done before the movie was released this movie is funny entertaining and respectful to the original best of all unlike most reboots this one actually changed the plot a little give it a chance
Jul 17 2016,positive,fun and funny action movie that kept me chuckling throughout and got me excited about the ghostbusters franchise again very wellcast and the cameos were a great treat
Jul 17 2016,positive,i dont care what anyone else says my husband and i really enjoyed this movie i went in there really tired after work falling asleep on the previews but as soon as the movie came on i woke up and laughed through the whole movie this movie does not ruin the original because it feels as if it became its own version like chocolate and vanilla ice cream they are both good stop hating people
Jul 17 2016,positive,i am not certain if most of the negative reviewers have actually seen the movie  i saw it last night and really enjoyed it  the characters were funny particularly mckinnon and jones and the plot itself was pretty decent  the movie had a great opening hook and some good scares  its references to the original and especially the anticipated cameos were great spoiler harold ramis does not appear as a ghostthough he is in the movies first act      i will say the film does suffer from a few underdeveloped plot points it feels like we jump through a few scenes a little too fast without the necessary connection points  other than thatreally solid reboot and funny
Jul 17 2016,positive,graphics were great story line as fun and actors were humorousmy kids really enjoyed it
Jul 17 2016,negative,disappointing  had its moments but in he end just felt pretty lifeless
Jul 17 2016,positive,loved this movie it was a lot of fun lost one star from me bc of the character kevin really think he took away from the core
Jul 17 2016,positive,dont believe the hype hilarious even more than expected the team works brilliantly together a little overambitious in the climax but unexpected cameos tie it all together
Jul 17 2016,positive,when i first heard about a female cast for ghostbusters i felt sure it would be terrible you cant just remake a movie like this however dan aykroyd is an executive producer that alone says something plus i knew going in that melissa mccarthy is incredibly funny there are callbacks and cameos but this story is not trying to be a redo of the original its a new cast with new personalities i did note that chris hemsworths character is really not a bright guy and some folks are upset about that but he has a real comedic talent that i for one didnt know about the interview scene was great my husband and i both loved this movie it was genuinely funny with very talented comedic actors i have to wonder if the hate being piled on this movie is a gimmick for attention i would not put it past hollywood to pull a stunt like that but whatever i am still looking forward to the blu ray with extended scenes and outtakes
Jul 17 2016,negative,pure hot garbage like drinking a gallon of boiled egg nog on the beach in august avoid like swineflu it could kill you of boredom so its just as deadly purely manhating bullshit
Jul 17 2016,negative,terrible film they actually explain halfway through that the proton packs only capture the ghosts then the scriptwriter decides to spontaneously change that and they evaporate them insteadno problem with female cast but hemsworth is there just as guy candy so surely that is sexist and the black character is an offensive stereotypethis film gave me aids
Jul 17 2016,negative,epitomizes the work meh which is really disappointing considering the very high level of talent and production i dont think ill remember any of the rare times i managed anything more than a chuckle but then again maybe its a movie that kids will enjoy as much as i enjoyed the original when i was a kid i doubt i wouldnt have been as enamored with the original had i first seen it as an adult so maybe im just the wrong audience for this dull hitormissmissmissmissand miss again comedy
Jul 17 2016,positive,had to give it a chance and really enjoyed it its just a fun movie with a lot of laughs for the whole family
Jul 17 2016,negative,its garbage harold ramis is spinning in his grave right now play ghostbusters the video game and settle the score with the lore this movie needs to be drive to the 1 dvd bin as fast as possible also its not about being starred by women the writing is awful the jokes are insulting to anyones intelligence the plot is grossly incompetent and there is nothing in this shell that makes this feel like ghostbusters besides the title sony slapped on the cover  do not listen to professional reviewers on this one this is nothing more than a feminist propaganda push think for yourself on this one these positive scores this certified fresh is all one big fat joke  this is an insult to men women and all fans of ghostbusters this movie is for no one
Jul 17 2016,negative,not as smart or funny as the original full of that tiresome selfreferential knowing humour you hear in us comedies like new girl
Jul 17 2016,positive,fun and entertaining for the whole family  parents millennials home for the summer and teens all enjoyed it it was the only movie we all agreed on  we all had favorite parts  i give extra credit to the movie because our mit alum did not feel the need to point out scientific inaccuracies and was just caught up in the fun
Jul 17 2016,negative,this movie is mediocre at best it shouldnt have been made it feels like its a cash grab just like that abysmal ninja turtles movie there was 3 people in the theatre with me on opening night dont waste your time with this gigantic pile of garbage
Jul 17 2016,negative,as a huge ghostbusters fan i was extremely excited to see a movie i have been waiting for for almost 25 years i was not upset with the casting decisions and just genuinely pumped up to see another ghostbusters film    this film left me depressed if someone were to parody the old ghostbusters movies this is what youd get execution was terrible script was bad story was lazy the smart humor that made the original a classic is traded in for cheap comedy relying on stupid one liners slime spewing and bad jokes the cameos were appreciated but had me scratching my head wondering why these guys would agree to be in this horrible movie     i was one of the people laughing at those who were saying this movie would ruin the brand i was wrong this movie does so much damage to the brand this movie should never have happened i would have rather been hungry for a new ghostbusters installment my entire life than have been insulted by the crap they slapped the ghostbusters name on this movie might attract a new ghostbusters audience but fans of the classics will leave with a bad taste in their mouth and sick feeling in their stomach    worst reboot in the history of film
Jul 17 2016,positive,this movie is great and it is better than expected however the humor is not always funny but i liked this movie
Jul 17 2016,positive,i loved it excellent cast fun story some nods to the original very well done
Jul 17 2016,positive,movie was great was funny and had a great story plot i enjoyed all the cameos kate and leslie had great breakout performances the comedy was appreciated because it was just like when i get together with my friends not faked at all good job girls i hope to see another one
Jul 17 2016,negative,this is one of the most disgusting cash grabs i have ever seen in my life i feel like a corporation reached into my credit card and ate my money and then shits on my face i need to bleach my eyes after watching this nobody should see this
Jul 17 2016,negative,mostly unfunny and frankly irritating the humor is much more low brow than the origional and the special effects are terrible even when compared to its 1984 counterpart there not really anything good i can say about the movie it got a few chuckles out of me at certain times but for the most part i wanted to bash my head into the seat in front of me   children might enjoy the movie but it definitely pales in comparison to the origional
Jul 17 2016,negative,im in shock that they traded intelligent funny dialogues of the original movie with cheap jokes its occasionally funny but cheap nonetheless    zuul the servant of the mysterious godlike villain of the original who wanted to bring about apocalypse is no more now its just a bully wanting to get his revenge because the world treated him badly     its sad because these talented actresses deserve a better movie    ghostbusters 2016 ended with the message for harold ramis and then a post credit scene with the dialogue have you heard of zuul    this movie is definitely not for harold ramis and sony is going to ruin zuul
Jul 17 2016,neutral,middle of the road not a bad way to spend a couple of hours but could have been so much better
Jul 17 2016,negative,had two chuckle moments not a single laugh out loud moment  pathetic really  i love melissa mccarthy but this movie was just terrible  so terrible 
Jul 17 2016,negative,poor reboot of original movie   the method of technology used in the game and how they just knew how to use the equipment was so unreal  the cameo of the original cast members was a poor way of trying to fit them in
Jul 17 2016,positive,loved it  cant wait to see it again definitely my new favourite ghostbusters movie brilliant actors great plot super funnies and surprising cameos
Jul 17 2016,positive,saw ghostbusters it was fun it was good the climax fell a little flat though there were a ton of great moments throughout kate mckinnon steals the show quietly and then very dramatically there was no manbashing in sight seriously folks grow up the cameos were fantastic  particularly harold ramis and ernie hudsons lastly stay through the credits itll give the crusty old ghostbusters fans like me a special treat
Jul 17 2016,positive,i was laughing the whole time and looking forward to each character i liked the balance they created as a team and how the movie flowed really well not needing some phony instigator for each scene i loved it down to the end credits scene
Jul 17 2016,positive,does not deserve the hate this was a fun summer movie
Jul 17 2016,positive,beautifully done not just retelling of the first one and the casting and cameos are spot on
Jul 17 2016,positive,saw it and loved it
Jul 17 2016,negative,painful best part was the credits at the end so i could go home
Jul 17 2016,positive,as a girl who wanted to be called peter when she was a kid who made a trap out of a shoebox and string who used her popples backpack as a proton pack i was ready to naysay the new ghostbusters movie it was highly entertaining and they did a great job making the new movie its own entity while not following the original layout too closely my favorite thing about this movie was the incredibly funny kate mckinnon
Jul 17 2016,negative,a disaster of epic proportionhow this has got a score of 73 is beyond me did sony pay for reviews 
Jul 17 2016,negative,one big pile of meh not terrible enough to be a loved classic not even bad enough to be angry about just a flat comedy on part with all of the old snl comedies we used to get
Jul 17 2016,positive,rotten tomatoes had this movie at 78 when i checked it thats about right but they dont lose points for acting all four women did a great job  very on par with the original the storyline was good there were cute cameos by five members of the original cast no any weakness was in the editing there were at least three transitions that were rough it messed with the flow     but the really delightfully unexpected moments were in the ending credits whoever put those together deserves an oscar there was a postending scene buried in the credits that hinted at a sequel or implied that this new one was the prequel to the old one and there was interplay between ghosts props and the text of the credits that was so clever    im 57 so ive been to a lot of movies there are always a few people who sit through the credits this time almost the entire audience sat through the entire credits laughing with delight when it ended and the screen went dark we all sat there another minute hoping for more ive never seen that happen amazing    ps kate mckinnon is comedy gold
Jul 17 2016,positive,this was a funny and modern remake of a classic initially i was skeptical because how does one out do the great bill murray just like this it was a great movie and i will be seeing it again
Jul 17 2016,positive,the cast are amazing and work together perfectly so funny and truly entertaining so great getting to see women kick butt
Jul 17 2016,positive,there are excellent set pieces and the actors are delightful the finale is beautiful colorful and fun a fun time at the cineplex
Jul 17 2016,negative,complete garbage this movie is terrible
Jul 17 2016,positive,it is a fun movie i like the new female cast and cameo from the original series  the movie trailer kinda of spoil some surprises
Jul 17 2016,negative,im only giving this a decent rating because the ghost looked good the characters were all linear no character development in the movie at all they crammed every fart and private joke they could in the movie and every guy was stereotyped the same an idiot who couldnt do anything the cameos of the original ghostbusters was mainly them yelling at the girls the movie had too many plot holes that rendered it unwatchable all and all the only thing redeemable is the ghost and how they look
Jul 17 2016,negative,in an age of reboots and remakes ghostbusters isnt terrible but if you do nothing to improve upon the original in terms of technical advancements and scripted comedy especially for a ghostbusters film it makes your movie pretty redundant
Jul 17 2016,neutral,the opening sequence  as well as the character holtzmann  bodes well for the updated ghostbusters however the script suffers the same fate as the original and that is the buildup is better than the conclusion nevertheless i found the foursome female ghost fighters to be a riot the villain was rather lame though and why are the ghosts only blue and green id wait for it to come out on dvd
Jul 17 2016,positive,this movie was funny exciting and full of great effects  all the roles were wellacted especially the four leads  there were some minor issues but nothing that kept me from enjoying the film
Jul 17 2016,neutral,a couple of ok laughs and some spectacular cameos didnt amount to much in the end for me
Jul 17 2016,positive,fun movie with lots of throwbacks to the originals
Jul 17 2016,negative,the critics who gave this a fresh rating must have been paid off  terribly disappointing lukewarm humor  the only great part is the animated scenes  not even a hemsworth could save this film  not even cameos could save this movie  the comic writing of harold ramis is sorely missed
Jul 17 2016,positive,this movie is exactly what it should be a bit silly nerdy and humor directed perfectly at the teenage audience that loved the original no complaints here from a big fan of the first movie all the actors do a good job and there are some really good laughs well done
Jul 17 2016,negative,terrible movie not funny jokes ruins the origal not good
Jul 17 2016,negative,this film was bad  i just saw the new ghostbusters film here is an honest review in my opinion   firstit is not because the cast was females i want to makes this abundantly clear i was actually looking forward to an allfemale cast with the likes of melissa mccarthy and kristen wiig and was interested to see the angle they would take    my rating an absolutely abysmal 1 out of 5 for two reasons   first the original ghostbusters cameos bill murray dan ayckroyd were well done   second the story is complete and doesnt sequel bait i hate when movies do that    beyond that this movie has to be the worst movie i have ever seen   jokesterrible by the end no one in the audience was even giggling   animationlaughable eddie murphys haunted mansion bad   action subpar a handful of cool moments but they are forgotten in the rest of the horrid nature of the film    plotpointless the villain has no motivation or at least one that make sense    charactersforgettable and stereotyped i cant remember a single name only their mannerisms     i feel the script is mostly to blame it was so poorly written that the cast does their best to try and work around it but in the end not even the cast can redeem it the pacing of the film is so off that you will be saying wait what how did that happen a lot    this film is a slap in the face to the ghostbusters franchise and basically says none of the previous films happened and that this is the new ghostbusters   it makes me nervous to see the future of this franchise whether we see sequels or the inevitable back to the future remake if this is the ghostbusters world we have to live with i want to bust this ghost in the face    if you are a fan of ghostbusters do not see this film if you are a fan of good films in general do not see this film
Jul 17 2016,positive,this movie was awesome thought it would be cheesy far from it
Jul 17 2016,negative,if any of those jokes made towards kevin were made towards women this movie would be torn apart by critics the only likable character was holtzman the comedy was extremely relevant meaning this one wont hold up for 5 years due to all the cute jokes paul and cast wanted to sneak in the plot was generic as was the original i laughed a total of two times and thought the ghosts looked like a late 90s cgi
Jul 17 2016,positive,good movie nice cameos from the original cast members
Jul 17 2016,negative,worst movie in a looooooong time
Jul 17 2016,positive,this movie actually surprised me it was so much better than i thought it was going to be i feel like a lot of boys are especially mad about how the main cast is all women and somehow will ruin their childhood it is new it is fresh and there are so many reboots of a lot of other things anyway i dont understand why this movie would supposedly be the worst of them all and for people who dont like the kevin character being dumb well i guess guys will know how it feels when women are portrayed that way honestly i made an account just for this movie please take the movie as it is and i freaking  there are some parts where the joke isnt funny but there are more funny parts for me than there were unfunny by far the cast is all funny but i would understand that the main villain was alright wait till the end of the credits
Jul 17 2016,positive,3d that literally leaps past the screen best 3d movie since avatar plus the movie was actually great despite reviews
Jul 17 2016,positive,the movie was good  dont listen to thenhaters
Jul 17 2016,negative,main characters lacked humor only funny aspect was the university dean flipping of the scientist kevin chris hemsworth made the movie more enjoyable to see after awhile with his stupidity only laughed around 5 times throughout the movie it tried to hard to create humor and failed tried to hard to be serious when things were just corny and tried to hard to create a story line that would pay respests to the original by bringing in the old cast
Jul 17 2016,negative,this movie does not do its job well  the critics have obviously been paid off and that is sad but this movie is a train wreck start to finish awkward pacing and crappy writing riddle the movie with inconsistencies some scenes are bestowed upon the audience in which the audience doesnt know how to react should i laugh feel sad or what but in reality you just continue to try and trek through this almost two hour abomination of a girls can do it too movie i maybe laughed twice in this movie at jokes and laughed several times with how stupid or bizarre at something that happened queef jokes yeah fuck this movie in all honesty this couldve been a good movie im not against female casting and that was the original idea behind ghostbusters 3 but making a movie that not so sublty disses men and then not so subtly realizes that its own joke writing skills are not above a middle schooler is a disgrace to the originals
Jul 17 2016,negative,absolutely terrible
Jul 17 2016,positive,dont listen to the purist geeks and misogynists best time ive had at a movie theatre in years a great summer popcorn film suck it haters
Jul 17 2016,positive,this film is absolutely hilarious while i was worried it might just be ghostbusters with ladies i was proven wrong the characters are well thought out and fully fleshed there are respectful nods to the original film whilst still maintaining its own character the jokes are well timed and suitable for all the family
Jul 17 2016,positive,this reboot is legit funny has a lot referencescameos from the old movie but good enough to stand on its own and before i forget chris hemsworth can dance
Jul 17 2016,positive,great time warp back to the original movie and with great class loved it
Jul 17 2016,neutral,its not a bad movie in my opinion there will be many opinions about this movie this is mine    its a rather average movie i didnt hate it and it is fun for the most part however only about 70 of the jokes landed or werent the same repeated joke if you hate the trailers will this ease your mind lolno if you go in wanting to hate it surprise you will  was it fun and funny enough to be entertaining yes    holtzman was my fave manic to the point of where the line between batshit crazy and utterly brilliant are very much blurred shes definitely crazy and that craziness was played very well    i am a screaming man baby will this destroy my childhood did you like ghostbusters 2 because it will ruin your childhood no mare than that money grubbing waste of film space time and money    what about the female cast hey ease up on that shit wait sort of ease up penny was ghetto to the point where you wonder if it was written by someone after they binge watched all of eddie murphys entire back log its 2016 can we move past the lol black chick from da hood ghetto style stereotype please despite that they all work well enough butnot as a group  whoa what yeah they dont feel like much of a cohesive team they feel like an interconnected group of sort of but not really friends    why arent you comparing this to the original because this may be a reboot this my take almost the exact plot markers but is clearly not the same movie i mean they never get locked up by the cities mayor and there is no dickless to shut them down sort of ugh im not going to spoil that little detail    the writing was average the special effects were really good the new weapons were all mostly good and the acting as a whole was equal parts boring and amazing the film was fine its not a bomb but i will be surprised if the movie crosses 100 million    as a side note i took my partner dana she has only watched the original one or so times and she thought this movie was pretty boring so let that impartial judgement sink in    also stay after the credits
Jul 17 2016,positive,dont believe the nay sayers      the film does a wonderful job playing homage to the original and seeing the main cast have cameos in the film was a real treat this film does not try to take away the fun from the original but rather find its own way the specters are a true colorful marvel and a lot of fun the film is not deep in its plot but neither was the original both the original and this reboot are intended to be fun popcorn flicks and nothing more i will say i had my doubts with this film as i do with all remakes reboot and sequels but this was a pleasant surprise i will say that if you already have the mind set to hate this movie then i would not matter what was on the screen your will hate it as for me i enjoyed it immensely and i hope to see these ladies again
Jul 17 2016,positive,funny witty and packed with entertainment this film may not reinvent the wheel but definitely provides more character debt and does not disappoint
Jul 17 2016,neutral,i dont understand how a 73 translates to a certified fresh  you realize that is a c letter grade right  middle of the road one step above not passing a class  that is how this movie was
Jul 17 2016,positive,its not exactly a terrible film but it doesnt live up to the original either the problem with the film is that it is an origin story that has a sense of humor comparable to the original without meeting that level  the script was just not as good as the first ghostbusters film and most of the jokes are hit or miss  if they make a sequel hopefully it has a better plot
Jul 17 2016,negative,unoriginal childish painfully unfunny attempts at comedy and a complete rip off the studio much have bought off the critics to get positive reviews shockingly poor dont waste your money
Jul 17 2016,negative,where can i get back my ticket money not worth it
Jul 17 2016,negative,worst reboot ever the jokes were cheap and cheesy and went on for too long only good thing about it was slimer and the other ghosts looked cool like the originals also cameo from the original cast was awesome but paul fieg needs to stick to girly movies and leave classics alone
Jul 17 2016,negative,pretty shitty tbh thought the feminists would give us an entertaining movie however in my opinion this was a pretty big fail
Jul 17 2016,negative,horrible movie i want my money back going to take a break from hollywood for the foreseeable future
Jul 17 2016,positive,a fresh take fresh direction worth seeing and remove all your ideological sensibilities at the door its just a film mate
Jul 17 2016,positive,a good fun movie that doesnt take itself to seriously like others it has its flaws but if you see passed them youll enjoy it    ive said its no where near a critically acclaimed blockbuster but its a great sunday afternoon film to curl up on the sofa and have a chuckle with
Jul 17 2016,positive,nice good looking ghosts the first two was scary some funny moments melissa and kristen were great mckinnon and hemsworth were irritating nice cameos from original cast movie was a lot better than that infamous first trailer give this movie a chance not the trainwreck you think it was gonna be    addendum liked the movie but making chris hemsworth dimwitted was unnecessary if he was supposed to be the male version of janine melnitz they got his personality totally wrong kristen wiig  melissa mccarthy had good chemistry kate mckinnon was annoying with her craziness and technobabble dialogue that people dont care about and if she was supposed to be egon thats another character they got wrong
Jul 17 2016,positive,definitely an enjoyable film many laughs worth seeing
Jul 17 2016,negative,my lord this movie was a travesty the plot and characterization is horrible this is a blatant cash grab
Jul 17 2016,positive,i expected much and was not let down at all wiig and mccarthy are unstoppable and jones and mckinnon are excellent a very good production that will have you laughing soooo much also the cameos by the original cast and a ton of other greats make this the best summer movie experience ive had
Jul 17 2016,negative,ghostbusters is equivalent to two of your friends doing an inside joke but you dont know what it is so its not funny but your friends think its hilarious
Jul 17 2016,positive,possibly the most meta movie ever made not just in the callbacks and injokes that frankly start to wear a bit thin culminating in a dan aykroyd cameo that would have been relegated to the special edition dvd if streaming wasnt taking over but in the way the reaction to the film has been woven into its most essential plot elements  if anything the chief villain is so closely relating to the fuckbois wailing about the very existence of a femaleled ghostbusters that theres a perfectly good conspiracy waiting to happen about the backlash being a pr stunt    the humour thankfully isnt all selfreferential and for the most part works the tone of the film is broader than the original but it announces itself early and doesnt let up  if there is a flaw its the unevenness amongst the cast wiig and mccarthy both get their share of moments but are essentially both doing their interpretation of straight man surprising as it is to learn that mccarthy has restraint in her repertoire pretty much leaving the way clear for kate mckinnon to steal not just every scene shes in but every shot  leslie jones is a bit more of a contentious figure  theres no getting around the fact that the early criticism of the only nonwhite character being so thoroughly urban and being the only one of the leads not from an academic background has some merit  jones has a couple of great moments and does her best  possibly better than the writing deserves  but her casting is a wellintentioned but poorly executed stab at diversity    nonetheless while its not perfect it hits all the right notes for a highconcept action comedy  if anything its the film that the original stripped of rose coloured nostalgia glasses aspired to be but didnt quite manage
Jul 17 2016,positive,a great movie loved it i was a doubter but they all turned me into a believer not only in this movie but they ladies that played the characters i hope a 2nd and so on can be and will be made a fun piece of mass hysteria
Jul 17 2016,positive,loved gb2016 i came home after the movie and rewatched the original just to see if it was as good as i remembered it and while it was good in a screwball comedy of its time kind of way good i came away preferring the remake it added more back story to the two main characters that made the ghostbusters endeavour more believable within the context of the movie and relatable and there was really no parallel to the quirkiness kate mackinnon brought to her character she was fabulous so yes it was a fun night at the movies in its own right loved its kickassness and i think it stands up to the original
Jul 17 2016,positive,you know this movie is good made a lot of ghost busters references from the first film and second  most people reviews here feels like they just gave it a bad review just because theyre a holes i just wish there was a way you had to have proof before you rated a movie
Jul 17 2016,positive,absolutely outstanding laugh out loud from start to finish a lot of nods to the original whilst still being a totally different film cameos  from a lot of a the original cast
Jul 17 2016,negative,saw this movie last night girls night out      our friends told us not to see it so we knew what we were getting into we were at least hoping for its so bad it is funny kind of movie  but no we didnt get that it was entertaining enough to sit through it all so it deserves 1 star      we probably should have saw independence day
Jul 17 2016,positive,good storyline super funny and great special effects i was laughing through the whole thing and really enjoyed it i will definitely be going to see it again
Jul 17 2016,positive,so its a remake and they have switched gender big deal give it a chance  it has funny moments and really we are here for nostalgia more then anything else i looked for the cameos from the older films to be perfectly honest  on that note though the new on brings in new and funny characters mckinnon was great at the weird smart and just out there girl and to add to new characters hemsworth was the other that brought this movie to life  those two carried the movie along wel  wiig and mccarthy were their same ol usual self so there isnt much to say aside from that they are lrobably b here because they work with the director often  is it perfect no but it is entertaining and the ghost fight with mckinnon was one to have fun with
Jul 17 2016,negative,shame on the script  the lousy writer was obviously lazy      dont pay attention to rotten tomatoes just ask a friend    if curious then go see it  but also get a second opinion from a friend that has watched  asking people will save your money and time
Jul 17 2016,positive,ghostbusters is the sequel to the 1980s film starring bill murray and a team of talented male leads flip that and the chicks break out the jumpsuits in this starstudded sequel some people think this film was a message on feminism i just saw it as a fun romp where kristen wiig and melissa mccarthy got to let loose and do their thing this merry band of misfits gets together after mysterious apparitions begin appearing throughout new york city it turns out someone is trying to build a portal to let ghosts ambush the city and the newly proclaimed ghostbusters have to stop them at all costs this film had beaucomp entertainment value and was immersively fun i enjoyed the colors and the set pieces and thought this was an overall fun family movie  b
Jul 17 2016,negative,for a remake to be justified it should improve on the original  this film does not do that  it pales to the original in every dimension    also a little tip to sony and paul feig dont accuse those who dont like your movie of being sexist  theyre not sexist they just didnt like your shitty movie  have some selfrespect
Jul 17 2016,negative,very disappointed  whoever says this is funny are lying  terrible movie  cant trust critics or the audience scoring  if you like saving money pass on this one
Jul 17 2016,positive,took my family to see this kids have never seen the originals we really enjoyed this movie plenty of laughs cameos and great special effects kids ask will there be a number 2  i hope so if its as much fun as this was
Jul 17 2016,positive,jillian holtzmann and her two gun fight scene is the best thing to have ever happened to me fantastic movie i laughed the entire time fantastic cast lovely special effects truly wonderful story arch also chris hemsworth was too cute for words
Jul 17 2016,positive,the script is cool casts are well chosen
Jul 17 2016,neutral,i didnt hate it but i laughed
Jul 17 2016,negative,boring unoriginal completely dumbed down from the original dont see it    am i sexist now because i gave valid criticism or was it only sexist before i bought a ticket to see the film
Jul 17 2016,neutral,ah i went in with high hopes but it came out flat with some good parts
Jul 17 2016,positive,great update to a classic the original cast cameos were great and tons of great one liners see this movie if you want a shot of nostalgia and some modern takes in a great movie
Jul 17 2016,negative,pottyhumor with awful plot and poor cgi
Jul 17 2016,positive,silly but very enjoyable
Jul 17 2016,positive,it was overall fun not all the jokes land and the ending is a bit rushed but i was laughing the whole time
Jul 17 2016,negative,the script was clunky and was very choppy it was just really hard to watch my wife and i just shook our heads at the supposed funny parts they tried so hard to make this funny but just made it horrible
Jul 17 2016,positive,overall a good not great movie didnt like how they incorporated the original cast didnt feel like it lived up to the hype and tons of promotion put out for it nonetheless i would recommend to watch it at home for free not in theaters
Jul 17 2016,positive,guess what its fine see it in theatres
Jul 17 2016,positive,very funny must watch at the very end of all the credits
Jul 17 2016,negative,this cast is bad why do people insist it is good i dont get the melissa mccarthy thing kristin wiig is meh and leslie jones is just an awful stereotype  kate mckinnon is fresh hemsworth is okay too  the movie simply should never have been made at least not in the way it was
Jul 17 2016,positive,just so much fun   never seen a movie where so much wrong was said about it i didnt go in expecting it to change my life and found myself incredibly moved by seeing women in just a big dumb hyper theatrical ghost comedy so much badassery good luck not falling in love with kate mckinnon i dont care who you are
Jul 17 2016,positive,finally a movie that has a very fun story keeps the laughs coming and awesome cameos also i felt the use of cgi was done just right   and i have to say it looked better than any cgi i have seen in a long time   i was nervous because i had high hopes for independence day 2 and it was a pile of crap  such a waste  a bunch of cliche wimpiest acting ive ever seen same with zoolander 2  so i was nervous for this but it was great  so so happy with it  my kids and i had the best time and its about time a good movie was made
Jul 16 2016,positive,please ignore these bad reviews they are pissed off naysayers who just hate that the original was remade it was a hilarious movie gut busting laughs and the audience in the theater clapped at the end
Jul 16 2016,negative,strongly disliked this one just wasnt a funny reboot
Jul 16 2016,positive,tons of fun great to see a comedy where women kicked ass both literally and figuratively paid homage to the original very nicely too
Jul 16 2016,positive,this reboot of ghostbusters was fun to watch with an all female lead with lots of references to the original i wish the cameos had some reoccurring roles but the fun was in the special effects  there were many references to the 80s movies  the concept of capturing ghosts was not there and most of the nostalgia was about keeping things on the down low  it seems a sequel will be in the works  overall it was a fun movie to watch even with chris hemsworth playing a stupid secretary
Jul 16 2016,positive,i dont know what im more angry about  that it was nothing like original or that i liked it it was funny as hell some decent scary or shocking scenes good special effects without overdoing it decent story line and overall a good and entertaining movie to watch
Jul 16 2016,negative,just not funny best line came out of dan aykroyds mouth
Jul 16 2016,positive,funnier than the original with rapid fire jokes awesome special effects too great movie for dates groups families everyone will enjoy this film even the pessimists  stay till the very end to catch all the comedy and cameos
Jul 16 2016,positive,full of great moments casting was perfect cameos galore and even the credits had me tickled its the movie we deserved happy young girls will see a stellar female cast getting tons of laughs even an awesome fight sequence loved it
Jul 16 2016,negative,i honestly didnt smile or laugh once
Jul 16 2016,positive,a solid movie i must admit it would of been a lot better with the original cast but the women did an amazing job here a lot better than most reboots
Jul 16 2016,positive,despite a subpar marketing campaign and what the trolls would like you to think ghostbusters was a charming funny and entertaining movie that will be fun to break out every halloween b
Jul 16 2016,negative,corniest movie eve horrible jokes terrible dialogue bad acting bad editing lame plot attempts made to wink at the original was insulting unfortunate because i like the main cast even bill murray wasnt funny
Jul 16 2016,positive,pretty much the best modern reboot one could hope for hysterically funny wellcast and superbly directed even if the pacing has issues
Jul 16 2016,positive,i actually watched this movie with my eyes and it was so fun  lots of great jokes cameos chills and action  a great tribute to a movie i saw when i was 7  somehow it did not destroy my childhood
Jul 16 2016,negative,so this was a long shot to begin with and walking away feeling underwhelmed wasnt a surprise  the movie had some laughs jumps and cringes but ended up grasping for the same  mccarthys comedic style was stretched as far as could be mckinnon was a bright spot and usually is  so all in all mckinnon was funny and the movie was meh
Jul 16 2016,negative,my hopes and dreams have been destroyed its right up there with learning that theres no santa claus and the tooth fairy is but a mere myth     i wanted to love this movie and show support for female comedians as a byproduct but i simply cannot with this onethis movie was the worst movie of 2016 and possibly 2015  worst      the actors    i could not stand the persona kate mckinnon chose  she gives snl so many hilarious diverse and interesting characters so why she chose a bizarre unrelatable unlikeable troll of a human is beyond me it made me both physically ill and angry to watch her     melissa mccarthy was not funny and as boring as watching paint dry    they could have had a box cut out of kristin wigg for her role     and leslie jones just needs to go i cannot stand her angry loud black woman bit thats the only thing she can do the worst part is that she was the funniest of the four of them    i need to wash away my disgust dont even watch this movie if its on for free     goodnight and godspeed
Jul 16 2016,positive,absolutely brilliant movie i am definitely considering watching it again ghostbusters had everything i loved a funny cast science and the paranormal amazing cinematography and a fantastic ending the theater i went to was full of kids and their parents and everyone enjoyed it a lot of people clapped at the end which i was pleasantly surprised to see good job sony i cant wait to own it
Jul 16 2016,positive,kate m stole the flick but what a great redo  the entire cast was great
Jul 16 2016,positive,lovelovelovelovelovelove instant classic mckinnon was epic well done homage to originals and updated  progressed well
Jul 16 2016,positive,while many of the jokes are hit and miss its impossible to compare it with the originals inventive and witty script this incredibly fun film is an absolute treat with wonderfully scary ghosts not just saying that the ghosts in this film are genuinely unnerving  and the wonderful chemistry between its four five if you count the wonderfully dim chris hemsworth stars the standout being kate mckinnons borderline insane jillian holtzman this film is worth every minute of your time you will happily give it
Jul 16 2016,positive,selfaware action comedy with just the right amount of callback to the original a dynamic cast with good chemistry a male taking on the role of a female character i have seen all too many times and some awesome ghost designs honestly if you saw this and disliked it i think you went into the wrong theater somehow
Jul 16 2016,negative,dont believe the hype  this movie is not better than the original lol    dont be fooled if you dont know who to believe than wait to watch online    dont give your money away to these people  their work is not worth a penny
Jul 16 2016,positive,dont listen to the girl bashing haters of the world ghostbusters evolved into amazingness these ladies are hilarious in this movie cameos galore and references for any fan go watch it with an evolved mind
Jul 16 2016,negative,worst movie of all time
Jul 16 2016,positive,worth a watch all of the characters were funny and quirky but i loved leslie jones portrayal of patty the power of patty i wish that they hadnt dumbed down chris hemsworths character kevin quite so much making him of average intelligence among all this scientific geniuses would have worked just as well as making him ridiculously dumb all in all the movie was fun to watch
Jul 16 2016,positive,absolutely tons of fun its so rare to actually see multiple women doing action or comedy and these four did an amazing job at both the characters were outstanding and memorable the effects were great and even the background characters were lovable and hilarious if the movie has any real drawbacks the music could be a little hitormiss and the narrative felt a little rushed and a little too heavy on the rising action vs developing the world almost like a tv pilot still neither of these were enough to ruin an otherwise great movie and the credits sequences was amazing
Jul 16 2016,positive,to be honest i had really low expectations for this movie but it ended up being a pleasant surprise  well worth the price of admission  stay till the end credits for a surprise
Jul 16 2016,positive,loved it great storyline  graphics were amazing
Jul 16 2016,positive,screw the critics this movie was awesome great graphics and definitely funnier and scarier than the old moviesstill love the old ghostbusters by the way classicbut the ladies rocked this one
Jul 16 2016,positive,despite the hate of this reboot even during its filming ghostbusters did a a great job in silencing the skeptics by bringing the same fun and funny feel from its original to the new environment the comedy didnt feel forced and the cameos from original casts even the ghost cameo adds up to the fun and nostalgia the only problem is with the editing i  find it a little bit rushed in some scenes making the dialogues seems cut halfway
Jul 16 2016,positive,loved it very funny it was a refreshing take on the old classic
Jul 16 2016,positive,fantastic better than the original
Jul 16 2016,positive,this is absolutely worth every dollar spent  this film pays subtle homage to the original throughout but is absolutely no copycat     no previous experience necessary go see this movie today you will not be disappointed
Jul 16 2016,positive,i loved this movie i dont know why people are so negative about it i loved both ghostbusters before it and while this movie will never be what they were it stood on its own it was hilarious and fun
Jul 16 2016,positive,this was different compared to the original and obviously there was no way to compare this to the original  kate mckinnon was the best part of this movie plus with the exception of rick moranis all of the original ghostbusters made cameo appearances      there was great character development but it felt like most of the jokes kind of fell flat which is why i didnt give this a higher rating  overall this gets a 710
Jul 16 2016,positive,without giving away too many spoilers this movie i hilarious  i might have made this a more grown up movie closer to rated r or 14a but thats probably why im not a director  this was extremely enjoyable
Jul 16 2016,positive,from witty comments and ghostbuster appeal this was a very enjoyable movie the new characters had great chemistry with one another the cameos were there but not too overdone and the effects set the tone of the movie really well it doesnt exactly top the original but im glad with the different direction they went with this movie this movie really exceeded my expectations and i recommend it if you want to see something funny and adventurous this summer
Jul 16 2016,positive,these women take ghost busters to the next level   go see for yourself
Jul 16 2016,negative,thor was funny  kate mckinnon had some good one liners that is all
Jul 16 2016,positive,this movie was hilarious a change from the previous ghost busters movies which i also loved but all and all it was great and i would definitely watch it again
Jul 16 2016,positive,i went in to gb16 wanting only to laugh and have fun the same reason we all liked the original before we became adults who learned how to criticize films more on that in my longer review tomorrow in that case i was not disappointed in short there were moments i liked it moments it started to drag a bit and moments i absolutely loved it in the end im delighted im so proud of paul feig im proud of the cast for proving women can be funny and kick ass and can do it in a way thats distinctly their own im happy little girls are seeing this and finally able to put themselves in the role of mad scientist and ghostbuster and without having to be the female version i laughed the majority of the film and cannot wait for the sequel im impressed with how well chris hemsworth can pull off comedyquite well actually and most importantly i now want to be jiillian holtzman    also it was the best use of 3d ive ever seen in a film
Jul 16 2016,positive,i loved everything about this movie  hilarious even through the credits
Jul 16 2016,negative,it wasnt that badit wasnt that good either  kate mckinnon shines in an otherwise forgettable film that ultimately completely misses the mark you will enjoy yourself walk out of the theatreand that is the last time you will ever think about it there will be no hey i wanna watch that again some time
Jul 16 2016,positive,as a standalone movie its actually quite funny  go into this with an open mind and not compare the original movies to this and you will definitely enjoy it    also it was very nice to see all of the original cast members make a cameo at some capacity  they even gave bill murray his wish    as for an ensemble cast i felt that kate mckinnon was under utilized
Jul 16 2016,positive,slightly better then average but really cant see where all of the hate is coming from sure its not an epic comedy classic like the 1984 original the cast was lightning in a bottle chemistry but its a fairly decent start on building a new franchise im expecting sony to follow this up with a sequel which allows the cast and story to stand on its own more plus setting seeds for expanding the ghostbusters franchise within its own universe the franchise rights will makes us rich beyond our wildest dreams so good to see ghostbusters name in theaters again my theater was fairly packed for being in a farming community and everyone was laughing where they should have but sony ruined quite a few jokes from letting them be tainted by their horrible tv promotions and trailers the cameos felt too forced then they should have and im taking bets an alternate ending was filmed but switched it up in postproduction reshoots the biggest flaw was the villain being more meh then a big bad monster he actually gave me the vibe of being an nod towards janosz from ghostbusters 2 speaking of all of you haters saying my childhood is ruined wasnt that sequel a bigger speed bump and it even had the original team in it
Jul 16 2016,negative,could be the worst movie i have ever seen for sure top 5
Jul 16 2016,positive,super fun loved kate and leslie in it would definitely buy this to own
Jul 16 2016,positive,i really enjoyed this film is it perfect no but you can still have fun with it it has funny moments great fun scares and great chemistry by the four leads and chris hemsworth that dude is funny ghostbusters is a solid fun popcorn time at the movies
Jul 16 2016,positive,so good made me laugh so hard
Jul 16 2016,negative,with a chance to really regenerate a classic they did this 
Jul 16 2016,positive,a cute fun romp the jokes were well timed and the cast had great chemistry great summer blockbuster and definitely worth seeing
Jul 16 2016,positive,i really enjoyed it a lot better than i expected
Jul 16 2016,negative,terrible terrible terrible not funny please do not watch this
Jul 16 2016,positive,entertainment at its best
Jul 16 2016,positive,loved it better funnier more coherent than in the nineties good to see the old cast as well
Jul 16 2016,positive,this movie is saved and made by kate mckinnon shes amazing and the best part of the whole thing followed by leslie jones and chris helmsworth see it for them
Jul 16 2016,positive,i give it a high score cause it simply made me feel good sure the jokes werent out of the park but there are plenty there to keep the giggles going through the entire movie and now after watching the movie im madly in love with kate mckinnon  
Jul 16 2016,negative,worst film of the summer
Jul 16 2016,positive,well this is a fun and interesting movie it gets lost a few times but recovers and keep going chris hemsworth steals the show a few times as a very stupid receptionist also the cameos are fun     so better than i expected and fun the credits are insane and fun chris does a dance routine    so fun and silly and full of jokes
Jul 16 2016,positive,ghostbusters good movie funny fun pretty great holtzman is my spirit animal way better than ghostbusters 2 really hope this does well enough to get a sequel
Jul 16 2016,positive,not bad but not great either doesnt do enough to be different than any other big budget special effects film doesnt capture the magic of the original still has its good parts 35
Jul 16 2016,positive,busted out laughing more than once very entertaining
Jul 16 2016,negative,what a waste of talent one of the worst movies ive ever seen
Jul 16 2016,neutral,a few funny parts did not make up for a movie that was easily predictable and where depth of character chemistry was sorely lacking  kristen mckinnon was the real highlight in the movie  her performance was excellent in an ivan reitman based role as the crazy scientist  for a movie that was a total reboot there was not much excitement generated for any future performances as the ghostbusters
Jul 16 2016,positive,this movie was way better than expected it was a lot of fun even if it didnt make me laugh out loud the entire time i just really liked seeing them together and it was a blast cant wait for a sequel
Jul 16 2016,positive,loved it  great story with nice call backs and cameos
Jul 16 2016,positive,please dont listen to the fanboy hate about this movie the only thing  that it will do is keep you from seeing such a wonderful funny movie  the new ghostbusters was everything and more of what i expected and  come to love of the ghostbusters     first off it was hilarious like to the point i had to stop myself from  laughing and it wasnt easy i laughed so much that my eyes started to  blur from the tearing up there were so many gut busting moments that i  couldnt help but crack up leslie for me stole the show with her bold  personality i kept wanting to see more scenes were her in it kate was  also hilarious all four of the ladies were strong in their own ways  and they worked very well together there was a lot of chemistry    the graphics and ghosts were amazing i definitely recommend seeing it  in imax 3d if you can i really felt fully submerged into the  ghostbuster world there were times that i was actually scared by the  ghosts and jumped out of my seat i dont ever remember getting scared  in the first two there were a lot of fun references to the first two  and really did a great job of honoring the legacy i loved all the  cameos by the original cast sigourney weaver was my favorite by far  dan aykroyd was pretty funny as well    i loved this version so much that im going back to the theatre to see  it again this week like i left the theatre wanting more also stay  until the end of the credits trust me on that one i really hope they  make more as i love a world where all four leads are four intelligent  strong badass women it will open the doors for so many girls and  women alike who might not have normally been brought in who am i  going to call kristen melissa kate and leslie thats for sure     i give it five ghosts out of five i really hope that it does well  enough to make more with these four fantastic ladies
Jul 16 2016,positive,bustin makes me feel good this was an awesome reboot and the whole cast and crew should be proud a new generation will rediscover the originals too everybody wins
Jul 16 2016,positive,great movie funny and the vfx are amazing feels as fun as the original with some new parts
Jul 16 2016,positive,i didnt really want to see this because i thought the trailer made it look really cheesy but i was incredibly surprised it was super funny and there are some awesome throwback moments  despite   most of the cast being from snl they did a great job with the characters and of course the addition of chris hemsworth fit perfectly definitely recommend
Jul 16 2016,negative,wish i could give this zero stars
Jul 16 2016,positive,i really loved it its funny and it shows women in ways that hollywood normally doesnt show the humor in this one is different from that of the original so keep that in mind while watching many people who said it was unfunny probably were expecting it to be similar to the originals but i and the audience in the theater i was at were laughing throughout the film
Jul 16 2016,negative,best thing to do find out from people you know that watch it if it was good or bad  cant trust the rotten tomatoes anymore    trolls giving 5 stars to this movie every minute  kinda  like civil war  it cost me 2 hours of my time and dads money
Jul 16 2016,positive,this movie was fantastic i am convinced that the naysayers are largely dudebros who either saw too much of themselves in the villain or less than they probably should have     the movie is brilliantly funny turning misogynist tropes on their head strong female characters who kick butt and are serious about their lives and their relationships with each other not with men     i loved it and highly recommend it to anyone with a sense of humour entitled dudebros will probably hate it but thats their loss
Jul 16 2016,negative,garbage do not waste your money
Jul 16 2016,positive,this movie has been so controversial and i never really understood it i just didnt connect with the original as much as others i guess but there was so much hate for the movie before it even came out ill admit the trailers were bad but i never trash a movie before i see it i also didnt like the hate saying anyone who wasnt interested was just being sexist and couldnt handle women ghostbusters after seeing the movie its all kind of goofy because this movie is just as average as the original in my opinion it has its funny moments the cast is good but it the story is lacking and its too cheesy and slapstick sometimes particular standouts for me where kate mckinnon and chris hemsworth i loved them both and you could tell they were having a good time the cameos didnt really bother me and the end credit are pretty unique overall its at least worth a rent doesnt deserve all the hate it is getting but it isnt great either
Jul 16 2016,negative,quality is terrible for a comedy thriller movie no thrills and no great laughs that we crave
Jul 16 2016,negative,horrible  wasnt worth the ticket price
Jul 16 2016,positive,better than i expected
Jul 16 2016,positive,a fun time for adults and kids alike im going back to see it again in 3d this time
Jul 16 2016,positive,this was fabulous the negativity surrounding the trailer was insane pathetic and so incredibly sexist it makes me sick i loved this movie
Jul 16 2016,negative,for as crowded as this movie was i noticed a distinct lack of laughter in the theater ill give it this much they tried they tried really really hard but in the end thats not enough the jokes werent funny the characters werent likeable i hated hemsworths dumbasabagofhammers kevin with a passion the cg was a dayglow nightmare that only reminded me of that uv graffiti that started showing up in the old tim burton batman movies if anything redbox it for a lark dont waste money at a theater
Jul 16 2016,positive,most of the jokes landed and even the ones that didnt were amusing the chemistry between the four ladies and chris hemsworth mostly worked while the cameos were enjoyable the special effects were topnotch while the ending was a bit of a letdown overall a thumbs up
Jul 16 2016,positive,smartly done  this movie was so much better than i expected from that travesty of a trailer they managed to capture the feel and aesthetic of the original beautifully  it was pretty much everything weve been looking for in a female cast i still just wish they had made the film a sequel or in the same universe rather than a remake a remake was always destined to create competition between the reboot and the original and therefore pit rabid fan boys against it
Jul 16 2016,positive,great sequel very funny and a very worthy follow up dont listen to the sexist haters
Jul 16 2016,positive,it started off very slow but started to pick up at the end of the movie there were a lot of funny parts in the movie which made it good as to some of the people wont probably like it is because they dont like the science fiction part about ghosts i personally thought it was a good movie while it is not the best movie to ever come out it shines in its own way by having humor drama and plenty of action
Jul 16 2016,positive,loved it most people claiming that leslie jones character was a stereotype were only basing that on the trailer they clearly didnt watch the movie and are just trying to bring the rating down because this movie ruined their childhood total bs this was a good movie
Jul 16 2016,positive,hubby  i loved it kate mckinnon is crazy and i love it  leslie jones is funny as heck im not a huge melissa mccarthy fan but she was good here as was kristin wigg  im not sure what it is but it just worked  the story was close to the original but different enough to keep it interesting  i love that they did an homage to the original cast pay attention everyone was there with 1 exception  the story line was silly but the ladies played it well and i loved the role reversal of the 4 women saving the world with the hot piece of beefcake thr for our viewing pleasure  oh and who knew chris hemsworth is hot never really payed attention to him but he played dumb very well  sure there were a few plot holes but all in all we both loved the movie we laughed most of the way threw it  and just enjoyed it good mindless silly fun sometimes it is just what you want in a movie
Jul 16 2016,positive,one of the most enjoyable movies ive seen this year it was funny and had a lot of callbacks to the original but not so much that you could see this movie without watching the original the characters were great together and even though the villain was kind of weak the movie makes up for it by having an amazing third act
Jul 16 2016,positive,i almost think this is better than the original i love the original because i saw it when i was 5 and then a dozen more times over the next 30 years if i had seen this movie instead i would love it just as much
Jul 16 2016,negative,so glad i didnt pay to see this  the gags are so poorly timed and can be seen seen coming from a mile away  it seems like 4 comedians trying to get their licks in at the same time  unlike the original the cast seemed tense around each other and not a team against the world like the original  i was given a free ticket by someone who was walking out after getting a pass for the next showing  from the reaction of the audience it seems only restless kids will be fans most likely because they havent seen the real movie
Jul 16 2016,positive,apologies to the cast and all involved with the making of this movie it was consistently funny and entertaining from start to finish well balanced well written look forward to a sequel its not the original ghostbusters but nothing ever could be it stands on its own
Jul 16 2016,positive,very funny you must watch it
Jul 16 2016,positive,this was a fun movie where i thoroughly enjoyed the action sequences
Jul 16 2016,positive,fun remake of a 1980s classic  the only thing missing was harold ramis
Jul 16 2016,positive,the best movie ever created only butthurt from sexists make it awesome
Jul 16 2016,positive,i really liked it i wasnt sure that i would because of how much i loved the original  but this is very good excellent reboot i took my youngest 2 children 14 10 with me theyve seen the original as well of course my daughter loved this movie she wants to be a ghostbuster for halloween now my son also enjoyed it and said it exceeded his expectations  i would go see it again
Jul 16 2016,positive,i didnt expect to find ghostbusters to be my humor at all but i was pleasantly surprised id totally see it in theaters again
Jul 16 2016,positive,they could not have possibly made a better reboot it was absolutely great
Jul 16 2016,positive,ghostbusters was a fun film easy to enjoy at brings back good memories from the original gb
Jul 16 2016,negative,the man hate in this movie is out of place a movie that should have risen above and went for an equal male and female movie failed while i rarely watch snl the last thing i want to do it pay to watch a bad snl skit in 3d for 2 hours
Jul 16 2016,negative,movie is horrible a blatant male bashing film  a slap to the face of any fan of the original cgi sucks cameos were forced  the movie itself is just bad to defeat the giant ghost they shoot it in the dck no i am not joking horrible i have no idea who is giving this movie anything above one star
Jul 16 2016,neutral,i think its worth a look at least once its not the greatest film out there though
Jul 16 2016,positive,laughed a lot and it was a good time not the original but is very much worth the watch
Jul 16 2016,positive,if youre not one of those people that are upset that women are in this movie then youll appreciate it for what it is pretty good movie good cast and many funny moments chris hemsworth came out of nowhere with the jokes took me back to my childhood worth going to see
Jul 16 2016,positive,watched this  hysterical
Jul 16 2016,positive,amazing i like it just as much as the originals the cast was spot on and it was beyond hilarious im a little confused why some people keep calling it scary though i laughed so hard throughout this whole movie i cant wait to watch it again
Jul 16 2016,negative,the plot felt rushed and very predictable it felt forced the story spent a lot of time scenes that did nothing for the actual plot for example they had multiple scenes where they were demonstrating ghost catching weapons interviewing thor for the secretary position cameos with original cast members etc these scenes wasted a great deal of time and did nothing to advance the plot it felt like i was watching a mediocre snl skit with good cgi i feel bad for the franchise feel worse that i wasted 60 and feel horrible that i lost 2 hours of my life that i will never get back
Jul 16 2016,neutral,is it bad no is it good no its ok tho at times i didnt like it then other times it was good its overall just ok with some cheap laughs and other times good laughs
Jul 16 2016,positive,better then the original
Jul 16 2016,positive,this movie is great  i will definitely go and see it again its very entertaining for kids as well you will laugh and you will be scared at some points overall i would recommend this movie to others
Jul 16 2016,positive,i truly enjoyed this movie  while bringing a fresh feel to the brand it adapted just the right amount of the old  great reboot
Jul 16 2016,neutral,not terrible but not necessary either an opportunistic reboot instead of an inspired one
Jul 16 2016,positive,this is not a prequel sequel or remake watch it for what it is a tribute to the original this was well made funny and worth seeing
Jul 16 2016,positive,loved it  i laughed through the whole movie  i saw it with a full theater and no one moved until all the credits were done
Jul 16 2016,positive,this movie was amazing
Jul 16 2016,positive,quite simply this film just wasnt funny enough  only earned two or three halfhearted laughs and 1 genuine laugh out of me and i found plot rather uninteresting
Jul 16 2016,positive,i still cannot work out how a collection of talented actors accompanied by excellent fx could produce such a ho hum movie
Jul 16 2016,positive,it is a good movie if you are looking for a funny suspenseful movie that you dont want to take too seriously as you would a made suspenseful or action movie  come into this with a light heart where you want to see a great cast of funny gals act out their expertise in humor in a greatly directed 2016 version of ghost busters   loved it and laughed all the way through    every actress does what they are best at and i personally love kate mckinnon  i left the theater with my girlfriend wandering where the 2 hours went
Jul 16 2016,positive,this movie is every bit as funny smart and epic as the trailers would lead you to believe the casts chemistry is impeccable the jokes land at the perfect moments and the effects are great finally a movie that doesnt idolize romance use women and forget its history a true gem of a film cant wait to see it again
Jul 16 2016,positive,after watching this movie im more baffled as to why sony executed one of the worst ad campaigns ever in regards to ghostbusters no it isnt as good as either of the first two but its not the war crime everyone suspected it would be    this is plain out a goofy somewhat lowbrow humor kind of comedy i might forget i watched it in a year or so but i can at least say i was entertained biggest issues were with the writing and editing with several jokes being dragged out far longer than needed and certain events just conveniently happening without much explanation    not a must see movie by any stretch but harmless
Jul 16 2016,negative,the writing oof the acting except a few kate mckinnon moments double oof the direction is paul feig mixing coke and tranqs  i wanted hard to like this movie but its a legitimately stale driedout turd
Jul 16 2016,positive,they really did a good job with this film  i love the new characters and it had an interesting story with the main villain  it was very funny and very well done  i think it would be a huge mistake to give this movie a chance if your bent out of shape over it  i will for sure be seeing this again
Jul 16 2016,positive,even though it tries really hard to walk its own ground ghostbusters cant stand up to the original kate mckinnon and chris hemsworth steal the show the cgi is phenomenal as well overall its not a travesty but it is middling
Jul 16 2016,positive,better than expected lots of laughs and fun for the entire family
Jul 16 2016,positive,i watched the original 2 movies religiously as a child and thoroughly enjoyed it did i have a few problems with the plot yes did i feel it pandered to my nostalgia yes but it was actually good at it as opposed the hack jobs other reboots have been lately this did things that the other reboots of properties of my childhood ninja turtles which i loved the original movies and cartoon and transformers which i was quite familiar with i enjoyed it and i was able to bring my wife and she enjoyed it and people brought their kids and they enjoyed it its a great nostalgia piece for the vets though mildly flawed with a huge benefit from effects advancements and it can get the newer generation invested enough to get a proper series from this franchise without all the infighting that we got thanks to bill murray in the originals    if i was allowed id give it a 7510 so im going 3 12 stars since thats about the same it was entertaining had a few flaws the biggest two being the remixed theme would have just loved using the original only and the character of kevin hate on me if you must but i will keep rewatching the original 2 but this definitely has a place besides the 2nd ghostbusters as my 2nd favorite
Jul 16 2016,positive,freaking amazing  its own movie with enough callbacks to feel like ghostbusters  its a game i would have proud to run after many many years of running the rpg
Jul 16 2016,positive,very fun movie  would definately go out and see it the trailers did not do it justice
Jul 16 2016,positive,its not the original but they didnt try to duplicate it either it was enjoyable as long as i didnt compare
Jul 16 2016,positive,it is a really good movie some may not like it some will plenty of laughs good action and the ghosts look good
Jul 16 2016,positive,girl power so fun i wanted to hear at least 3 different versions of the ghostbusters theme song this movie did not disappoint
Jul 16 2016,positive,people are only crapping on this movie because its got female leads i saw this on opening day and it was funny and very well done i loved this movie
Jul 16 2016,positive,actually way better that i taught it would be 
Jul 16 2016,positive,a hilarious film hits the ground running with suspense and comedy and does not let up i thoroughly enjoyed it
Jul 16 2016,positive,it was a delightful comedy with four great actresses obviously it isnt going to replace the first movie but it wasnt trying to  fun lighthearted movie to see with friends
Jul 16 2016,positive,ghostbusters was definitely funny and entertaining is it a perfect film no do i want a sequel yes i found myself really enjoying the new team and the natural comradery between its members my biggest gripe would be with the moments where the film tried to please the audience with nods to the original damn i never thought id say that anyhoo the laughs alone are worth the ticket price and i cant see how any kid wouldnt enjoy this reboot if you were wondering no my childhood wasnt ruined
Jul 16 2016,positive,it was pretty funny and good having never seen a ghostbusters movie before i didnt have anything to compare it to the effects and ghosts were good if it had been any other cast i probably wouldnt have seen it but i love the four actresses and i thought that kate mckinnon was especially amazing
Jul 16 2016,positive,campy and fun as all heck
Jul 16 2016,negative,the acting is bad the effects are bad the cameos are bad and the jokes are so bad that no one laughed just another remake flop
Jul 16 2016,positive,verry funny and in imax the special effects are great if you dont laugh you are dead inside
Jul 16 2016,positive,i have reservations about remakes but the new ghostbusters was fun the cameos were funny the movie benefitted from improved cgi it poked fun at itself and paid tribute to the previous ghostbusters films this was not a step by step remake of the original like many remakes are it was more like same setting but new story with new people some having similar motivations the women werent men with breasts i appreciated their humor why i did is a different topic the holtzmann character is my favorite  as with most movies nowadays stay through the credits it gave me a giggle 
Jul 16 2016,positive,the perfect amount of humor and cheese loved it so much cant compare to original but stands on its own good amount of scary too
Jul 16 2016,negative,this movie is bad disneys haunted mansion meets ripd starts with a queef joke
Jul 16 2016,positive,went in expecting it to be bad but loved it too death
Jul 16 2016,positive,this movie was so funny from the trailers i wasnt sure what to expect but i thoroughly enjoyed the movie especially kate
Jul 16 2016,positive,i went into see the new ghostbusters with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised i am as critical as anyone when it comes to new films and i believe in being honest and fair as well in my opinion the harsh critics were dead wrong about the new ghostbusters film i loved it mccarthy wiig jones and mckinnon are all at the top of their game in this film with a great supporting cast ghostbusters 2016 is funny fresh and stands on its own feet as a solid and good film looking forward to a sequel bravo
Jul 16 2016,positive,weve grown to be too cynical as a society how can anyone not love this movie theres no reason not to folks     its hilarious wellwritten features tastefully done cameos awesome special effects and surprisingly good acting i dont understand how anyone can give this poor marks it was in my eyes an absolute slam dunk that does a beautiful job at paying homage to one of my favorite childhood movies
Jul 16 2016,positive,i was a little skeptical but i loved it
Jul 16 2016,positive,this movie was hilarious the whole theatre applauded at the end the did a fantastic job
Jul 16 2016,positive,went to the movie with very low expectations and it turned out to be a pretty damn good movie
Jul 16 2016,negative,it was terrible critics are biased if they liked it stay home watch the original
Jul 16 2016,positive,awesomeness a great movie and a great addition to the ghostbusters franchise
Jul 16 2016,positive,just an excellent film from start to finish plenty of humor great effects i was hooked from the very first scene
Jul 16 2016,positive,loved this movie it is funny and wonderful to see an all female cast take this classic forward for future generations to see there is negative feedback from die hard fans of the original of which i am a part of that the majority of audience viewers who seem to like this aremiddle age mothers taking their children out to see it for the first time to this i say yes i am a middle aged mother and and my daughter thought it was funny and had a powerful message women are awesome too
Jul 16 2016,positive,my wife and i saw the movie and we both enjoyed the movie  it was the same but different at the same time  i enjoyed the cameos from the cast of the original movie
Jul 16 2016,positive,i cant say it was a great movie its ghost busters
Jul 16 2016,positive,even with its talented cast and occasional laughs ghostbusters didnt do enough to warrant its existence and all involved would have been better off making a movie without the ghostbusters banner
Jul 16 2016,positive,as a 1980s kid i was a huge fan of the original like a lot of people my age i was a bit horrified that they were remaking such an iconic movie from my childhood after reading all the dumb comments from 40 year old men trolling from their mommas basements i felt it my duty to give it a chance the new gb was funny and entertaining kate mckinnon is absolutely brilliant and chris hemsworth although sadly clothed for the entire film was hysterical as a prettyboy himbo while i wished they had actually departed more from the original i think getting out from gb84s shadow in movie two will give the film its own life and become an extension of the gb universe rather than just a remake    for any women who are discouraged and disgusted by some of the comments made about an all female cast theres hope for the future my son loved the movie for what it was an entertaining funny ghost asskicking and doesnt get why old guys are all weirded out by a female cast whats wrong with them that is the magic question son hooray men of 2016    go see the movie bring your older kids 10 its a fun and important way to send a message about cast diversity in film    if you have attachment to the original go read harold ramis daughter violets essay about her dad and the new movie
Jul 16 2016,positive,first off ghostbusters is my favorite franchise of all time and im a film student so i hope that my review deems a little bit of merit rather than an argumental stance ghostbusters is good is it a great cinematic film no the editing is awful the new theme is horrendous some of the cinematography really needs to be worked on but is it a funny thrilling summer movie absolutely these women are the funniest women in hollywood and ghostbusters proves it the cameos were delightful the nods to the original were great but not excessive in a way that doesnt allow the film to truly come into its own  a great modern take on a fantastic original with developed characters and wonderful writing
Jul 16 2016,positive,this movie changed my life and as an avid snl fan and fan of the original ghostbusters i can one hundred percent say that it deserves better than all of the terrible reviews for it i would like to personally apologize on behalf of all  the butthurt 40 year old losers who detested this movie before they even saw it because after walking out i was stunned the new ghostbusters left me in a trance from the moment i stepped into the theatre and a day later i still feel the same way it was hallarious heartfelt and true to the original so i ask everyone to please see this movie before you make any snap judgements about it
Jul 16 2016,positive,it was a nice upgrade to an old classic not amazing but good 
Jul 16 2016,positive,i went in with lowered expectations but this wasnt the disasterpiece the trailers made it out to be the main leads are very good though they couldve given kristen wiig more comedic opportunities and are easily the best part of the movie there were genuinely funny moments throughout and the cameos were mostly harmless i loved the slimer one the most but the script was spotty and the pacing was a little slow    still all things considered a solid movie
Jul 16 2016,negative,this crap has insulted me no only has a man but as a huge ghostbusters fan    what really disgust me is why this piece of sht has 72
Jul 16 2016,positive,its a fun movie  it takes a little time finding its groove in the beginning but definitely worthwhile
Jul 16 2016,positive,paul feig i loved it
Jul 16 2016,positive,better than original
Jul 16 2016,positive,great summer movie brings me back to the original classic
Jul 16 2016,positive,dont listen to the naysayers  go see it for yourself  i walked in skeptical  i really love the old movies but i was pleasantly surprised  i didnt feel like i was watching a ghostbusters remake  the writers and cast took the ghostbusters concept and made it their own  i cant wait to see more
Jul 16 2016,positive,i thought it was outstanding goofy and didnt take itself too seriously kate mckibben is comedic gold cant wait to see it again
Jul 16 2016,negative,the humor was mild and the story was pretty bad i mean the original ghost busters story was very good this one was kind of blah more over the acting was mediocre the new weapons were silly and seem to be created at break neck speed over all just a silly remake of a fantastic original    wife liked i not so much feels like a big let down
Jul 16 2016,positive,great fun and you leave the movie smiling
Jul 16 2016,positive,hilarious kept the theater laughing through the whole thing paid lots of homage to the original while adding fresh ideas cool special effects and fun action scenes hands down worth seeing in theaters
Jul 16 2016,negative,absolute garbage two hours of my life i wont ever get back
Jul 16 2016,positive,such a welcome and uplifting surprise to the ever increasing slate of sequels and reboots great characters pacing and overall tone thanks to well placed jokes and hilarious cameos 45
Jul 16 2016,positive,i loved this movie it had hilarious easter eggs from the previous films the continuity is really satisfying and the pacing is a welcome throwback to classic 80s and 90s comedies like beverly hills cop the jokes are sly and funny physical gags all over too went to see it with my wife and 12 yo son and we all loved it i laughed the whole time the effects were especially great to see because obviously the tech constraints of the early 80s were a limitation of the original
Jul 16 2016,positive,it was fantastic to see not just a movie with female leads but one encouraging a bit of diversity meaning they werent all white scantily clad supermodels but normal women also appreciated the lack of an unnecessary romantic subplot    ghostbusters was really funny with lots of mods to the original i enjoyed it a lot and would definitely watch it again
Jul 16 2016,positive,i really liked this movie i felt it had a lot of great lines good characters and was able to exist comfortably with the twin external pressures of the original films reputation and the laughable controversy over its fantastic main cast
Jul 16 2016,positive,so funny an instant classic
Jul 16 2016,positive,yes this is not the original  i thought the lady characters gave them the ability to tell a totally new story which is what they did  i didnt really have any complaints about the movie  overall it is a fun movie
Jul 16 2016,negative,terrible not funny and forced people giving this a vast review are over exaggerating it on purpose
Jul 16 2016,positive,its funny go see it
Jul 16 2016,positive,bill murray forgive me but i think i laughed more at this than i did at the original   and the special effects were incredible  definetely worth the few extra bucks for 3d
Jul 16 2016,positive,first ghostbusters pure popcorn movie saw it and was blown away this saw with my children aged 13 and 6 they were both blown away and this is a funny movie sadly ratings effected on rotten tomatoes and imd by people who do not love movies but their small brains see it and laugh
Jul 16 2016,positive,dont listen to to the haters if you already have negative expectation you will more than likely hate it everyone atbthebheater was laughing including my kids and i good show go see it
Jul 16 2016,positive,i thought it was great all around heres my review 
Jul 16 2016,positive,fun quirky and loaded with laughs the cast does a great job bringing this world to life and you can tell they are having a good time doing so dont look at this movie expecting ghostbusters 1 give it a chance at its own thing and you will have a great time
Jul 16 2016,positive,this movie is funny on its own and throws in some decent nods to the original kate mckinnon steals the show as holtzmann the only places where it really falls flat are attempts to redo jokes from the original but the new stuff is solid it was good for the kids 8 and over in our case and funny enough to keep the parents interested absolutely worth the price of the ticket
Jul 16 2016,positive,totally not a chick flick better then i expected
Jul 16 2016,negative,this website is soooo baised they gave this garbage a higher score the bvs lol what a joke
Jul 16 2016,negative,this movie is just disappointing and sad with a 144 million dollar budget this movie looks like a paranormal episode of friends the plot is horrendous and the acting is not much better the movie assumes that the audience is dumb and with low intelligence this movie is an ovious money brab and made for foreign audience who enjoy movies with a much less sueriberal plot line just save your money this movie is just a pandering piece of crap the women do not work it would have been much better with male lead characters it also lack any nee york vibe the only part of real new york we saw was the dam subway it had a phony and dumb character development instead of leaving the audience to think about the character development it told us everything making it boring there was also way to much time spent on the tech instead of catching ghosts there is also a huge plot hole because in the final fight scene they killed ghost but if i am correct ghost are already dead and you have to trap them just so bad there was the ocacional funny moment in the film kristen wig character was nothing close to billy murry she was pathetic and just desperate the best part of this film was lesilie jones the last and the most awful thing about the movie was the recreation of the classic ghost busters song which they butchered
Jul 16 2016,positive,great fun and funny
Jul 16 2016,positive,lots of fun i took my almost seven year old son to see it hoping it wouldnt be too scary for him it wasnt i am so glad were able to watch an awesome actionpacked movie led by four strong women hollywood we want more of these i dont go to the movies often but this film convinced me to open my wallet on opening weekend go and have fun
Jul 16 2016,positive,lots of fun for both myself my 10  13 year olds against all the pre movie negativity this was actually a well done funny and at times scary flick i definitely recommend it and so do my boys
Jul 16 2016,positive,this movie was so much fun seriously  go see this was it as good as the original no  but it was still effing great paul fieg captured the spirit of the originals and mccarthy jones mckinnon and wiig carry the story with comedy and relatable personalities for real  go see it i dont remember the last time i had that much fun at the movies and im already exited to see where the franchise goes next with these incredible women and paul fieg at the helm
Jul 16 2016,positive,this movie had me grinning the whole time as a ghostbusters 1984 fan as well as a fan of the makers and stars of this movie i went in with high hopes and came out ecstatic this is a movie i have been recommending to everyone snobbish true fans and newbies alike it kept up a wonderful pace with todays humor and was stocked with satisfying homage to the classic i was thrilled the only complaint i would have would be towards a lack of diversity but i can easily see the point of having the new cast directly correlate to the previous team kate mckinnon stole the screen and my heart with her electric oddball charisma these are not characters or relationships you often see in a movie this bankrolled the scares were just scary enough to make me clench my teeth but campy enough that the kids in the theater werent freaked once again i am a fan of the original from a family of fans of the original this was an impressive reboot and i can already tell ill be rewatching this ghostbusters as often as the first
Jul 16 2016,positive,to hell with the haters a fun movie
Jul 16 2016,negative,this movie shares a lot in common with the kevin character in it pretty dumb
Jul 16 2016,neutral,the godawful trailers fortunately are not a completely accurate representation of this film the cast is great particularly kate mckinnon and chris hemsworth however their charisma is not enough to save the film from awkward jokes that dont always land and a terrible third act that becomes a muddled cgifest ghostbusters 2016 is mediocre at best not unlike many movies weve seen this summer it certainly does not come anywhere close to being as good as the original but is still an enjoyable time if you turn your brain off and appreciate the talent both in front and behind the camera paul feig is a great director but this was a bit of a miss for him
Jul 16 2016,positive,great movie ignore the whining from the true  ghostbusters fans gamergaters girlgeeks can be awesome hilarious and brilliant and save new york honestly i havent laughed this much in a movie since my twin and i were asked to leave the theatre during the second part of the hobbit all kidding aside this was a fun movie made me feel good to be a gal and a geek the little girl sitting next to me in the theatre she was probably 8 or 9 seemed to enjoy herself immensely and i was glad she was seeing strong females on the screen i think there were some inside jokes aimed at the haters in one scene set at a heavy metal concert this horrific ghost appears and absurd things start to happen and a guy in the balcony at the concert shouts thats not punk well this is ghostbusters and funny as hell there were lots of great cameos from the original cast too the verdict anyone who would not expect a woman to wear stiletto heels and keep her makeup fresh through a fight with an alien will enjoy this movie tremendously
Jul 16 2016,positive,ghostbusters was a hilarious and empowering summer hit the chemistry between the girls was incredible and it was nice to see girls fighting fully clothed
Jul 16 2016,positive,i saw this with my son last night we both enjoyed it it was light and entertaining i loved the cameos of the original ghostbusters kate mckinnon was our favorite followed by leslie jones and chris hemsworth we stayed through the end credit to see the bonus scene
Jul 16 2016,positive,funny as hell i still love the original  think this reboot carries the ghostbusters banner proudly into its next phase fantastic performances all around but no surprise kate mckinnon steals the show as jillian ill absolutely be seeing this again
Jul 16 2016,positive,it stands on its own is funny plenty of nods to the original that all feel organic and not forced and was beautiful to look at i need to see it again
Jul 16 2016,positive,start to finish this movie had me laughing and loving enjoy just the energy of the film     anyone who says this movie is terrible and didnt see it is just being ridiculous
Jul 16 2016,negative,terrible movie poorly constructed script bad jokes paper thin characters overall very shit
Jul 16 2016,positive,great movie anyone who says different is just to picky
Jul 16 2016,positive,if you have never seen the original or if it has been a while watch it first several references to the original throughout this one but overall it was still really good and make sure you stay until the very end past all of the credits
Jul 16 2016,negative,hollywood its just time to stop with the reboots
Jul 16 2016,positive,dont know why all the hate thought it was a well done laugh out loud movie all the main cast members pull their weight and every living original cast member makes an appearance other than moranis hope they make another
Jul 16 2016,positive,awesome each women performed wonderfully and deserve awards for their work this movie is an inspiration to girls everywhere 
Jul 16 2016,positive,this was a really fun movie im a big fan of the original and always have that tinge of worry when seeing a remake  this movie had a perfect combination of being fresh and nostalgic the ladies all looked like they were having a great time together very worth seeing unless youre just a hater who would prefer to criticize it rather than just enjoying the ride 
Jul 16 2016,negative,terrible male bashing crap this movie is not worthy of the original
Jul 16 2016,negative,very underwhelming as a huge fan of the original this movie fell short i was actually looking forward to a fresh take on a classic but was sadly disappointed
Jul 16 2016,positive,i loved this movie i thought the plot made a lot more sense than the original and i loved seeing girl scientists
Jul 16 2016,positive,all that buildup  all that hate  all of those claims of sexism and misogyny  and this movie wasaverage at best granted its really difficult to beat the 1984 classic but still they couldve tried a bit harder its a harmless remake of a beloved franchise thatll probably be forgotten by next year i forgot it existed a couple minutes after i saw it ill just wake up one day see that its out on bluray and go âoh yeah that ghostbusters movie i saw i thinkâ thisll be one of those movies where the hype and the backlash was more controversial and interesting than the movie itself  the main four ghostbusters are too good for the antifemale ghostbusters to bash although kristen wigs character gets almost no development to her backstory but the movie is not a very good representation of the profemale ghostbusters since it portrays every major male character as an idiot or an asshole i want to love this movie so much since there are elements in this that i love and those that i think should be fixed or taken out completely its so close so close to being a really good movie again not as good as the 84 one but they couldve tried its not bad just forgettable and to those people who claim that this movie ruined their childhooddid you forget ghostbusters 2 exists
Jul 16 2016,positive,great movie full of humor and heart
Jul 16 2016,negative,leslie jones had a performance that was slightly above being called a mistrel show congratulations msjones you have made a career out of being an overexaggerated stereotype
Jul 16 2016,positive,this ghostbusters was far better than the original funnier faster bigger and better with the acting interesting characters and special effects i laughed a lot as did my gang im a guy and have no problem with full cast of women too many sexists out there and die hard nerds i would happily see this again and would recommend young women see this too im sure they would get inspired although in ghostbusters ii they gotta show leslie jones character getting a phd in science or add another black woman who is a scientist and add an east indian iranian or asian woman to the cast im serious marco polo is one of my favourite series and theres only one white guy in the production who cares its all about representing and being 2016 for christs sake
Jul 16 2016,positive,this movie is a gift i laughed so hard i had tears in my eyes dont listen to the men giving this 1 star reviews and judge it on its own merit  its a good summer blockbuster
Jul 16 2016,positive,it was awesome and great and funny and yall are just mad because those women are funnier than yall ever could be
Jul 16 2016,positive,aint no bitches gonna catch no ghost
Jul 16 2016,positive,so i kept crying throughout the new ghostbusters because it is just so damn good    hearing how flipping amped the little girl sitting near me in the cinema would get everytime they fired a proton beam was most definitely a highlight of the experience girls need heroes too    absolutely brilliant writing that warmed my heart and made me laugh out loud coupled with awesome thrills and action choreography  throwbacks to the real ghostbusters tv series  it really is a film for the fans    seriously go and see it
Jul 16 2016,negative,i expected to laughdidnt happen very disappointed
Jul 16 2016,positive,funny kids loved it
Jul 16 2016,positive,i was skeptical about this movie i wanted a sequel not a reboot but it was really great they need the old cadillac for the next one though
Jul 16 2016,positive,i was looking for the spark of the originalbut it just didnt come up to speed
Jul 16 2016,positive,this was absolutely hilarious so many laugh out loud moments and a number of references and cameos from the original
Jul 16 2016,positive,moviews ghostbusters 2016    my apologies in advance for starting this moviews with a psa      attention if you have not made plans to see this movie make them make them now four out of four stars dont miss it he dicho     okay now that thats out of the way this redux of the original 1984 classic that delighted generation xers around the globe is a precious jewel in this years lineup of summer films honestly i didnt know what to expect after listening to a very weird version of the original song i had some reservations but what i received was completely unexpected  when a movie makes me laugh so hard at a oneliner that i miss the next five minutes of it i have to give it a top rating tears were running down my cheeks i coughed out my popcorn i shook the entire row  believe it or not remembering it now is making me laugh again i know i know  you might not find that line as funny as i did but for me that huge laugh was worth my money ten times over    i loved three big things on the movie first the heavy feminism with which it is charged women are in control women treat a dumb but pretty man hemsworth like a piece of meat women kick major ghost ass and women stick together to achieve the end goal by taking the bull by the hornssecond the huge homage done to the 1984 movies there are delightful eggs for all of us fans of the original including small performances by all of the original characters with the exception of rick moranis whom i missed that extend through the entirety of the credits everything you know and love from the original is there  and even the new version of the theme does not sound as bad once youre enjoying the comedic genius that this film is third the puns granted there are some cheesy ones and some eyerolling ones and even some okay get on with it ones but theres something for everyone and i laughed out loud more than once that leslie jones chick is definitely not as annoying as the allstate commercials make her sound her timing is beautiful and delivers those punchlines with deadly accuracy kate mckinnon is a wonderful addition to the comedic trio spicing up the group with her overall weirdness and nerdy awkwardness wig and mccarthy obviously do a great job  but of the two i think wig takes this one by a mile her characters language barriers and the line delivered to the mayor of new york played by andy garcia are priceless and receive bronze and silver on the medalwinning jokes in this script    the fourth thing i loved i know i said three i lied is the script even though there are many recognizable elements from the first movie it definitely stands on its own the story though similar has enough differences to make it interesting and engaging   and fifth and i think last thing that i loved is the end credits whether it was tongue in cheek or intentionally done columbia pictures found the perfect formula to make us stay and go through the entire credit roll please do stay until the lights come on you wont regret it    my opinion dont miss it 4 out of 4 he dicho
Jul 16 2016,negative,zoweee  wanted to love this remakeactually no where near as good as the original  the problem was not the female cast but the crappy script they were presented  bill murray and dan ackroyd must be really hard up to appear in this loser  both actors are great but this is the wrong place for them they should spend their time making a movie together that highlights their talent  this movie worked under the premise of high tech splash and no substance  dont bother with this
Jul 16 2016,positive,fun funny fantastic loved it so much
Jul 16 2016,positive,for this being the movie the internet head loved to hate i was pleasantly surprised i thought it was a great movie the main concern going in i had was it was going to be a chick flick not at all yes its a predominantly female cast but i didnt feel like i was watching the bridesmaids catch ghost tons of laughs through out the movie  it was a great story yea the villian was lame but he was supposed to be each of the 4 leads brought there own unique styles in a time where hollywood is full of reboots this is definately a welcomed good one sure the new song sucks but im not reviewing an album this was definately a true ghostbusters movie in every aspect
Jul 16 2016,positive,obviously i was expecting my childhood to be totally ruined but then i laughed and kept laughing and it was all ok really funny even and now i wish id seen it in 3d the fact that i was spared emotional turmoil upon seeing women in leading roles must be some kind of miracle
Jul 16 2016,negative,i only like those 4 ladies and slimer
Jul 16 2016,negative,i dont often want to walk out of a moview  i wanted to like it  i like the main actors in it but the jokes were forced  character development was very minimal  at about 75 of the way through the movie i realized it wasnt going to get any better and wanted to leave but unfortunately stayed
Jul 16 2016,positive,cast was wonderfuland it was pretty funny
Jul 16 2016,positive,hopefully this is proof of how great the smartfunny woman combination can be  i hope for more of this in hollywood
Jul 16 2016,positive,heres my spoiler free review on the new ghostbusters in a convenient bullet point format   whoever cut those trailers should be slapped and then fired because they did a really horrible job at representing this movie    this movie is fun as hell   its safe enough for younger kids some cursing scarier looking ghosts and adult hand gestures but adults will enjoy the hell out of it too   i fucking love holtzman i want to be her when i grow up   speaking of growing up when i was a kid this would have been my absolute favorite movie i am so excited for all the little girls out there who get to watch this movie and have new heroes that are smart and determined women   the actresses played so well off of each other and had great chemistry again though i especially loved holtzman   the cameos and references will make any fan of the original smile like crazy   i genuinely laughed or was smiling throughout the whole movie  i give it a 1010
Jul 16 2016,positive,three times and countinglove this movie
Jul 16 2016,positive,marvelous rendition and reboot of the series personally was wanting a continuation but i am quite satisfied with it being a reboot
Jul 16 2016,positive,who ya gonna recall  my review of ghostbusters 3 stars    at the risk of incurring the wrath of online women haters who have had it out for this film since the first trailer appeared im just gonna come flat out and say that i was not a superfan of the 1984 original  i mixed it together with so many studio comedies of the time that forgot to be funny in their third act  it was perfectly serviceable entertainment but i didnt laugh nearly as much as i wanted to and that includes a revisit of the film last year      so i was one of the people actually excited about this distaff reboot which not only features four of the best women in comedy today but has the gifted paul feig bridesmaids spy as its director and cowriter along with katie dippold who also deftly appears as a real estate agent    feig not only has a knack for comic timing but he also excels in action sequences such as the stellar kitchen fight scene in spy  couple his talents with kristen wiig melissa mccarthy leslie jones and kate mckinnon and theres no way you wont smile while watching this film  its fun and fast filled with quirky line deliveries and special effects highly reminiscent of the first film but 10 notches better  unfortunately i felt the script needed punching up as the laughs came from the performances and not from the dialogue as much as i had hoped  for many just having jones shout every line or watching mckinnon pull crazy faces may tickle their funny bone but im more of a sucker for wellcrafted word play  young girls benefit the most from this as having kicks female role models in a big studio movie will surely have a positive impact on their lives      happily ghostbusters is no slavish remake instead opting to create a fresh new storyline for this girlpower twist  wiig plays it mostly straight as a soontobe tenured college professor who worries that her past collaboration with mccarthy on a paranormal activity book will jeopardize her position  in an attempt to shut mccarthy down from selling books during this tenuous time she gets sucked back into mccarthys ghost hunting attempts  supporting mccarthy is mckinnon who comes across as a vaguely butch steampunk firecracker who resembles a live action minion as she creates one ghostcatching apparatus after another  yes you may chuckle at how mckinnon does an impromptu dance in the lab but like much of the comedy its fairly random      jones arrives late to the party as a bored new york subway clerk who sees a ghost in the tunnels and calls upon the crew only to eventually join them  i mean her uncle has a car for them and shes a smarty so why notin the annie potts role as the receptionist comes chris hemsworth who goofily embodies his dumb hunk role  add a surplus of cameos from original cast members to other snl regulars like cecily strong completely wasted im sad to say and you always have somewhere for your eyes to go  special mention goes to zach woods silicon valley who i feel is given some of the best lines all of which are in the opening scenes      this is nutty storytelling with outrageous sequences jammed together sometimes with little rhyme or reason  when the ghosts come out including the original slimer and other iconic ghosts from the original the gals get gooey and acquit themselves well with their penissubstitute proton packs  mccarthy especially is a master at conveying manic desperation whenever embroiled in the physical comedy  her relationship with wiig in particular proves unexpectedly touching  from the original i will always remember the lines he slimed me and why worry each one of us is carrying an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on his back and the immortal we came we saw we kicked its ass  this reboot  not so much although kristen wiig comes closest with that stuff went everywhere by the way in every crack when referring to the famous slime  although not nearly as funny as it is just downright entertaining the new ghostbusters has earned its place alongside the original perhaps exceeding it at times with its liveliness and incredible cast
Jul 16 2016,positive,this movie was great it was ghostbusters in a new way with a hysterical cast including a surprisingly funny chris hemsworth new ghost weapons and 21st century technology and effects yet it still paid its homage and gave nods to the original in all the right places i honestly dont know why people are giving this movie low scores its ghostbusters a cheesy fantastical comedy about a group of paranormal scientists out to save new york from a cataclysmic invasion of ghosts i dont know what the haters were expecting but this movie lived up to the expectation of what it should be and then exceeded the expectation with a great cast lots of laughs and its own original rendition on a classic
Jul 16 2016,negative,very empty lazy plot the comedy is also very lame writers must have thought that constantly pointing out that the main female characters are strong and smart would negate the need for an interesting plot rich characters or witty dialogue to please the audience the audience is not that stupid and there are strong smart female characters in other movies
Jul 16 2016,positive,so good different enough to be a separate story but enough familiar touches for nostalgia scarier than the original and yet hilarious in other parts great movie all around
Jul 16 2016,positive,loved it not perfect by any stretch of the imagination but laughout loud funny with great performances
Jul 16 2016,positive,great fun the whole audience was laughing along throughout    it struck a pretty good balance between being faithful to the spirit of the original without being a stale samey carbon copy some of the callbacks to the original got a little old but not too bad ymmv  hyperpurists will probably be furious about some of the changes like no dont cross the beams comment but theyll be mad regardless repeating that plot point wouldve been boring im glad they didnt bother    the choice of antagonist and overall arc of the plot was surprisingly wellfitting in some ways it was less overthetop than the original but in other ways it was considerably moreso    mild spoilers  i was actually slightly disappointed by the sequel hook in the postcredits scene not because i dont want a sequel to this one but because it hinted that itll be using zuul from the original this seems doomed to artificially restrict the hypothetical sequel to a bland rehash exactly what i was glad they didnt do well see if they make it at all and if im being too pessimistic but its not like the original had a good sequel either
Jul 16 2016,positive,separate this film from the originals and you will love it cant wait to own it on 3d bluray
Jul 16 2016,positive,nerdy goofy factspouting feminists rule i wish they had this when i was a girlim glad my son lives in a world where girls can be ghostbusters too
Jul 16 2016,negative,while there were one or two genuinely funny moments the film just doesnt deliver more disappointing it fails as a worthy addition to the ghostbusters franchise     before you start to think that im being sexist female led cast was probably the most refreshing part about the film kate mckinnon stands out and is very fun to watch     the problem lies with several things the script was beyond dull the villain seemed like a hungover afterthought the visual tone was more on par with the land of the lost movie than something you would expect from a actionhorrorcomedy it just felt and looked silly there wasnt a single frightening moment in the film the directing was just plain uninspired     simply put this is not a good film by any stretch
Jul 16 2016,positive,fun  i think the actors do a great job all of them  they are subtle at times and touching  i think its a great movie to watch with friends or kids  i recommend seeing it in the theatre because of the great special effects
Jul 16 2016,positive,good movie but not up to the original did not completely  like the cast but good entertainment
Jul 16 2016,positive,funny fun with great nods to our original ghost busting friends this cast delivers and is refreshing to see
Jul 16 2016,positive,the girls did well hemmingsworth was well out of place as a secretary and the bad guys purpose of the ghosts releasing was not really explained also wish the cameos were a bit more substantialgreatly entertaining and amusing non the less
Jul 16 2016,positive,great fun with the spirit of the original  the 2016 version of ghostbusters does a nice job of both paying homage to the original version as well as creating a new set of characters with their own eccentricities  frankly the shortcomings of this movie remain the same as the original the need to have bigger and bigger ghosts and threats which adds little to the film  lots of throwaway jokes nice little cameos and plenty of laughs  while the ladies are all well cast and given plenty of solid material chris hemsworths casting as a dimwitted receptionist allows him to play off of his normal roles
Jul 16 2016,positive,was very well done and had a modern flair to it  kate mckinnon mad the movie
Jul 16 2016,positive,pleasantly suprised it was funny and fun wayyyy better than what i was expecting still doesnt hold a candle to the original though
Jul 16 2016,positive,very much enjoyed  laughed through it the story was good and we were still laughing and talking about it after  would definitely recommend it
Jul 16 2016,negative,terrible feminist movie
Jul 16 2016,negative,why is it that you cant have a reboot with an all woman cast and have it not be that arent men stupid narrative comedichorror please the only horror was the price i paid to see this hot mess and the only comedy was my face trying to figure out how you could waste the talent they lined up for this writtenbycommittee garbage steer clear and dont waste your money
Jul 16 2016,positive,entertainment thats what i wanted thats what i got
Jul 16 2016,positive,really funny and mixes the old style of ghostbusters with a nice modern touch liked it a lot
Jul 16 2016,negative,i fall sleeping  twice with this movie i did not get the plot 
Jul 16 2016,positive,the family thought it was great the ladies kicked butt especially kate mckinnon she was crazy and awesome at the same time good movie
Jul 16 2016,positive,really funny and refreshing i came in to this both hopeful and doubtful i heard a lot of criticism and cynicism before the movie was even officially released but i figured that even if it sucked at least it would be revolutionary im glad i was able to have my cake and eat it too the quirky humor of the script works beautifully with this new cast it is hard to dislike any of them as they are all completely unique and eccentric in her or his in kevins case own way ill be watching it again next week im really happy to have seen this on opening day and im hoping that this gets a sequel it deserves one
Jul 16 2016,positive,all the negative reviews are from men
Jul 16 2016,positive,im not a fan of melissa mccarthys brand of humor i was molded by the original ghostbusters movies and hold them sacred i hated the idea of a ghostbusters reboot starring this group of broads i didnt find the previews terribly funny and knew it was going to be a disaster     having said all that i took the family to see the new ghostbusters today and it was pretty dang good there were several laugh out loud parts many throwbacks to the original and enough action to keep all the kids engaged     they did a good job of setting the stage to care about these new characters while paying serious homage to the 80s originals several cameos from the early movies generate cheers with out taking away from the new version     good flick
Jul 16 2016,positive,i wasnt sure but it was funny and the women are great
Jul 16 2016,positive,you cant compare this to the original film but it does hold its own  ghostbusters has some jumps and laughs but one thing i like is the expanded weapons and training of said weapons  what i didnt like is the show felt crammed and at times sounded too scientific for viewers  all in all it was a solid film and one of the better ones this year  ps nice idea adding in the original cast like marvel does
Jul 16 2016,positive,i had an amazing time with my family while watching it at the cinema a film made with soul that brings back good memories go ghostbusters
Jul 16 2016,negative,absolutely terrible
Jul 16 2016,positive,bloody good fun with chris hemsworth the highlight some fun cameos and the manchildrens over reaction completely unjustified as my blu ray of the original ghostbusters is still intact and hasnt passed over to the other side
Jul 16 2016,positive,unexpectedly hilarious
Jul 16 2016,positive,i cant believe less than 50 of viewers liked this movie it was so funny i loved every minute and im pretty picky like i hated central intelligence which a lot of viewers liked because it just felt super forced ghostbusters was not forced and did not disappoint maybe people just didnt get the humorgo see this movie it wasnt scary but it had those moments that caught you off guard i found myself kind of shouting in surprise and then it would turn into a laugh if youre looking for something scary or some artistic special effects action movie or something maybe this isnt the one but is is a solid comedy with no boring parts
Jul 16 2016,positive,almost a perfect reboot
Jul 16 2016,positive,a good start with a new story clever gags and cameos the climatic scene is a little overdone relying more on cgi than the busters skills and smarts do hope for more from this group
Jul 16 2016,positive,very funny laughed all movie  totally recommended
Jul 16 2016,negative,this movie took a huge dump on the original id rather see ghostbusters 2 because that cast has chemistry unlike this reboot where every actor just does their part and goes home at the end of the day paul feig has to let go of his habbits and let his actors breath instead he forces them to play same exact parts as they always but this time they are huntin ghosts the worst part about this movie is that its suppose to be a modern take on the team but what they are actually doing is just swapping genders and make men and women look stupid    they manage to do this not only by giving chris hemsworths character an iq of 0 but by making everyone else that is in this movie portay the movie as revolutionairy having an all female lead cast is just doing what has been done for the last century and gender flipping it if this movie wanted to be new refreshing and revolutionairy give us a new plot dont just redo the original make the characters believable think outside if the box and make the team mixed genders next time oh and one more thing that just sums up the whole movie bill murray plays a man who doesnt believe in ghosts and doesnt trusy the ghostbusters and he plays the part with barely any heart i say you do what bill murray would do an leave this ghostbuster reboot where it belongs in a box full of ghost samples only this time dont research it just toss it in the bin
Jul 16 2016,positive,laugh out loud funny
Jul 16 2016,positive,silly and super funny i would recommend this movie to my friends and i will definitely be back to see any pending sequel
Jul 16 2016,positive,when i first saw the trailer i was so excited because this looked like such a good movie i didnt understand all the hate surrounding it though like franchises get remakes all the time its no big deal anyways the movie was sooo good i absolutely loved holtzman and how hilarious she was there was nothing notably bad about this movie so you should totally go see it 1010 recommend watching
Jul 16 2016,positive,a worthy reboot just as fun and loud as a summer blockbuster should be with a little unexpected and muchwelcome heart thrownin by the female ensemble im a big fan of the original so i had pretty high standards and was pleasantly surprised some gags work better than others and this was perhaps more slapstick than the original male characters were indeed charicatures but get over it that was sort of the point as in the original film the humor that works best is the stuff thats quirky and characterbased
Jul 16 2016,positive,i had a good time and was super pleased that they had a dumb blonde    calling thor a flying beefcake now you cant stop me
Jul 16 2016,negative,this is by far the worst movie i have seen in my life if i didnt pay an arm and leg for it id walk out and throw my 80 dollar bucket of popcorn at the screen i have fell asleep three timeswoke myself up with my snoring on the third time its a day after it was released in the theater and there is a total of nine people watching it right now save your money folks and by a bootleg copy off the streets
Jul 16 2016,positive,hilarious 1010 will see again just as silly and funny if not funnier than the first sat next to a little boy that was totally pumped throughput the entire film like the original youll love the new version just go
Jul 16 2016,positive,now the hype for this movie was all wrong  the movie is just good it is not amazing it is good one issue is that they had was that there was too many jokes and also there was a script with chris hensworth character was really small  i felt like maybe that the script would be better for the movie if hensworth character had a smaller part  the whole purpose of this movie was about a ghost not too make funny jokes about fighting ghosts from reading this review you should see this if u are a big paul feig and  if you like ghostbusters you would like it  if you hate comedy you will not like this films this movie is a 7 out of 10
Jul 16 2016,negative,absolute embarrassment of a film made by a mysandist man hating dandy  the film pushes a blatantly pc social justice warrior political agenda and according to the director the studio and all of their coerced and paid off media shills youre a sexist piece of shit if you dont go along with the company line and support this utter trash  its uninspired unfunny racist sexist and filled to the brim with every horrific stereotype you can possibly imagine  but the worst crime of all is using such a creative and witty brand while completely throwing away the backstory joy and humor the original entailed  its such absolute shit even china in their western cinematic infancy refused to import it  not because of the ghosts as the studio pr has tried desperately to spin it but because of how absolutely terrible it is  our audience wouldnt enjoy it was their response  avoid like the plague  its time to send a message to these elitist out of touch executives that we wont be bullied into supporting their trash
Jul 16 2016,positive,it was really funny been a while since i was able to cut loose like that in a movie there werent enough people there though i blame trump
Jul 16 2016,positive,very funny great cast exactly what i was hoping for
Jul 16 2016,negative,really this is what we waited for
Jul 16 2016,positive,didnt deserve the hate that it received great movie but i dont want them to ruin it by making a sequel kate mckinnon really stood out and it would be great to see her in more major roles
Jul 16 2016,negative,hohum another hollywood remake the ladies felt like they were trying to see which one would be the alpha the comedy was strained the last half of the movie was an abominatin to the senses poor cgi ghosts the only redeeming quality of this movie was melisa mcarthy getting slapped please hollywood writters make something origional orr at least some contitinuity you could have made the women the daughters of stanray egon and winston i would rather see plan 9 from outter space than to see this piss poor showing of a film
Jul 16 2016,positive,a funny fresh reboot there are a lot of potential stories to be told in the world of ghostbusters the feig reboot is a hilarious fun adventure set in this iconic franchise the cast is a group of talented comedians who had awesome chemistry i loved the cameos from the original cast i really enjoyed it and i will look forward to a spooky sequel 
Jul 16 2016,positive,first thing i want to do is calm any fears some people have that this film is all in your face with feminism it isnt not once is there a girls can do what boys can do vibe anywhere in the film nor are there any moments where you feel any forced equality preachy crap notable exception the hilariously crafty way they worked in the ladies responding to internet criticisms it was a lovely fourthwall break    okay now that thats out of the way lets get down to it i was worried as well as others about the direction they decided to go with it being a reboot instead of a continuation but it completely makes sense we are introduced to new characters that have studied the paranormal and the way ghosts start appearing also has a satisfying explanation the chemistry the ladies share as a group is phenomenal and yes melissa mccarthy dialed it way back for the film so if you were hesitant based off of her past performances you neednt worry    really the only person that seemed out of place was chris hemsworth but i think thats based off of preconceived notions about how hes supposed to act although some of his goofiness does seem forced    the cameos were handled beautifully and theres a very touching tribute to harold ramis egon early in the film actually the entire movie feels not only like something new and exciting but also a wonderful love letter to the originals scenes happened that gave me goosebumps most notably the beginning scene and when the crew is all together for the first time as fullon ghostbusters  i am very very happy with the finished product it has restored my faith in reboots    stay during the credits and dont be afraid of no ghosts    personal references i was born in 1980 pretty sure the original gb is the first movie i remember watching i had all the toys even the firehouse i am a rabid gb fan
Jul 16 2016,positive,funny finally a comedy that is actually laughoutloud so rare the 4 ladies are hilarious well done
Jul 16 2016,positive,perfect blend of hilarity corniness and ridiculousness the actresses are perfect and this movie was so entertaining good job ladies
Jul 16 2016,negative,i was going to cut this movie slack knowing how difficult it would be to keep up with the original 2 ghost busters movies however this was much worse than i could have ever anticipated
Jul 16 2016,positive,dont let the haters fool you this film was a lot of fun even my brother who thinks movies are only good if they have an artistic message laughed and had a good time
Jul 16 2016,negative,beware good special effects good credits at the end i laughed once that they resurrected the original cast for cameos points to why this remake is not equal to the original
Jul 16 2016,positive,very fun movie and in some ways better than the original it fulfills all the requirements for a summer movie and the future of the franchise is in good hands
Jul 16 2016,positive,the move was very enjoyable
Jul 16 2016,positive,this was an amazing film there were great nods to the original movies and it was great fun honestly i was worried it was going to be bad writing but seriously i had a great time honestly best film of the summer
Jul 16 2016,negative,forced comedy is never good doesnt matter if its an all female crew all male all black all white all whatever
Jul 16 2016,positive,hilarious it had just enough nods to the original to honor it but still feel fresh i will be seeing this again
Jul 16 2016,positive,better than the original i went for the nostalgia thinking they would ruin a childhood memory but loved it all four leads are hilarious but kate mckinnons character deserves its own movie came in a skeptic came out a fan
Jul 16 2016,positive,it cant really stand to its predecessor in terms of worthiness and the fact it recycles many plot points but this new ghostbusters stands on its own as a relatively funny and memorable comedy in its own right
Jul 16 2016,negative,chris hemsworth was the only thing of comedic value the entire movie unfortunately it wasnt nearly enough
Jul 16 2016,positive,did what it had to not too many side plots
Jul 16 2016,neutral,most of the jokes failed but when they didnt it made you forget for about 10 seconds about the bad ones the special effects were pretty very colorful but also somewhat cheesy
Jul 16 2016,positive,hilarious and lives up to the franchise
Jul 16 2016,neutral,let me say that i liked the movie growing  up in the eighties i wasnt sure if id care for a full reboot i kinda wanted ghostbusters 3 this isnt  however its none the less enjoyable   with cameos throughout of the originals  the film is charming enough for new fans and old alike if i had to say its down side was it had a bit of less triumphant feel and was a tad anti climactic  however the cast is strong and hemsworth steals every scene  some of the one liners where a bit corny as well as some green screen work but i would recommend it i do think if theres a sequel it could be even better
Jul 16 2016,negative,this movie sucks dont waste your money  rent the original
Jul 16 2016,positive,movie turned out better than i expected im not usually a fan of remakes but this one is a mustsee totally worth it
Jul 16 2016,positive,we actually thought it was better than the original nice job of incorporating features of the original movie into the new while being its own film
Jul 16 2016,negative,eh it wasnt bad but wasnt nearly as funny as i hoped itd be loved the nods and cameos from the original though
Jul 16 2016,positive,hilarious movie with wellwritten characters
Jul 16 2016,positive,just as much fun as the original if you liked the original you will like this
Jul 16 2016,positive,the movie was good anyone that says otherwise is an idiot
Jul 16 2016,positive,great movie really funny and despite what some say not man hating worth the watch
Jul 16 2016,positive,my dudes it was so fantastic so funny so rad so much action did i mention it was funny in a sea of awful tasteless unfunny comedy movies this stands out like a shining hopefulgiving beacon i love love loved it i understand the worries of classic ghostbusters fans but speaking as someone who is also a fan i can honestly say it does its ancestors right respecting the original while being its own entity
Jul 16 2016,positive,amazing fun movie that keeps you laughing and smiling stands on its own and tells a great story for young girls to see these smart women kick ass at fighting ghosts with science and knowledge special effects are amazing and the 4 women just have a chemistry that makes the movie flow and be so amazing i can wait to see it another 5 times best movie
Jul 16 2016,positive,over all it was pretty good i enjoyed it if you liked the old ones you may like this one humor was strange but good
Jul 16 2016,negative,save your money and watch anything else i think they confused the word funny with cringe worthy
Jul 16 2016,positive,the four female ghostbusters were equally funny great screenwriting and special effects and directing highly recommend
Jul 16 2016,positive,took daughter and niece who both loved it we all laughed out loud through the whole thing we agreed that it was even better than the original which we also loved they were still laughing about it the next day over brunch super fun
Jul 16 2016,positive,i cant remember the last time i laughed so much if you dont like this movie you hate fun and everything good in life like beer and puppies
Jul 16 2016,negative,awful lame potty humor poor visuals weak script
Jul 16 2016,positive,it has moments that could be better i didnt really like that kevin was a complete idiot i would have liked it better if he showed some genius at the end with some kind of joke like you never asked and it was awkward to see them shoot the ghost in the genital area     but that being said the special effects were great it had the same feel as the original ghosts in a modern movie the ghostbusters seemed to actually be friends and get along this movie is more funny and less scary than the original     i honestly dont understand all the rage about this movie it was funny my husband loved the first two and saw them in theatre as a kid and he liked the movie
Jul 16 2016,positive,love the original this one stands on its own just fine with plenty of nostalgia for fans of the franchise     kate mckinnon shines bright in a wonderful cast
Jul 16 2016,positive,better than what i expected
Jul 16 2016,negative,was excited about the ratings on rotten tomatoes  they fooled me again  cant trust the critics or audience on rotten tomatoes anymore    best thing to do is ask questions to someone you know that has watched the film
Jul 16 2016,positive,the new theme song is a hate crime against music but i loved the movie
Jul 16 2016,positive,goofy fun entertaining especially at a imax
Jul 16 2016,positive,plenty of nods to the original while still being its open entity
Jul 16 2016,negative,just didnt make sense not funny the most amusing part of the movie was kate mckinnon and her goofy expressions the story was just bad
Jul 16 2016,negative,what a waste of time on an old idea
Jul 16 2016,positive,so so good     so thats what its like to be the target market demographic
Jul 16 2016,negative,just as bad as independence day
Jul 16 2016,positive,this movie was great im not sure why people dont like it this was just as good as the first ghost busters maybe even better loved this movie
Jul 16 2016,positive,hey look im a girl so its kind of cool on that point i mean im pretty tired of women not taking centre stage and maybe the appearance of this film is due to the fact that my demographic 2535 females are a good target because were online more than anyone else and perhaps more liable to spend money but capitalist feminism or not ill take it as for the film itself there were some really funny bits not sidesplitting like bridesmaids but a lot of potential and before i go dissing the campy ghosts well imagine how cheesy they would have been if 84 and 89 ghostbusters had had the technology anyway im feeling forgiving mainly because i feel a franchise coming on there are logical hints pointing towards this and thus just as i longed for them to make ghostbusters 3 as a child im going to take this movie as an opener and eagerly anticipate the next ones
Jul 16 2016,positive,surprisingly excellent go see this movie youll love it i know i did we were laughing so hard at some point someone in the theater fell out of their seat
Jul 16 2016,neutral,paul feigs rendition of ghostbusters offers many laughs a few standout performances kristen wiig and neil casey in particular and a boatload of special effects sadly and i mean that whilst holding back tears the film altogether falls flat i wanted this film to be absolutely great on paper with the cast and feig this seems like a home run but the plot borrows a bit too much the majority of the characters are fairly onedimensional the dialogue seems as original as that of transformers 4 ive got a bad feeling about this and ultimately it is too much an action film and too little a screwball comedy by no means is this a bad movie but  it certainly isnt great either
Jul 16 2016,positive,it was entertaining
Jul 16 2016,positive,i actually enjoyed the movie i went in with an open mind didnt compare it to the old one though yes a lot of things were familiar and some were not i thought it was a nice spin on it kate stole the show a few times as well but i was not disappointed at all
Jul 16 2016,positive,surprisingly funny movie chris hemsworth was hysterical glad i went to see it
Jul 16 2016,positive,ghostbusters is a fun movie with many chuckles throughout i cant help but feel like we are retreading what had come before i much would have rathered these new characters advancing the plot of the old film in a true sequel the cast is great and the movie does what it needs to for an entertaining flick
Jul 16 2016,positive,a fun movie to watch with a highly talented cast
Jul 16 2016,negative,if it if not broken leave it alone the best parts where the cameos minus bill murray with the biggest part the cast member who said no to every part 3 script so may times that harold ramis even passed away then the snl movie cast and crew give him the biggest cameo the cast tries too hard you will miss the last cameo by sigourney weaver in the end credits its the best part yet very strange i love kristen wiig dont be a sell out this movie is about  leave originals alone
Jul 16 2016,positive,lol funny  kate mckinnon steals the show mccarthy is great and no not her usual but funny character really enjoyed it strongly recommend seeing it good fun with lots of nods to the original without being the same im looking at you spiderman
Jul 16 2016,positive,women will find it funnier than men because for once its not a malecentric show it has good action sequences and for once in cinematic history its the only guy in the show who is a one dimensional character i highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants a laugh
Jul 16 2016,negative,it was disappointing jokes werent funny and it sounded like too many adlibs were allowed  hemsworth was not funny and contributed to some painful acting moments  he was probably directed that way but it was hard to watch as a remake it was predictable and boring      leslie jones recent abuse on twitter is bs though  she didnt make it bad  she was just fine
Jul 16 2016,positive,this is an awesome movie i was a little unsure after the first trailer but it was hilarious and surprising its great how the writers brought in the best elements of the old story but then had a fun new plot with brilliant new characters the four main actors make an amazing team and i love how supportive these ghostbusters are of each other i would definitely recommend seeing it in theaters
Jul 16 2016,positive,absolutely hilarious and the villain is perfect and so on point its sad that some male audience members dont feel particularly welcome or as if this movie wasnt intended for them theyre absolutely right but i guess its sad for them that their egos werent pandered to in a summer blockbuster for once
Jul 16 2016,positive,a fresh take on a thought dead franchise ghostbusters answer the call is a great remagining of the ghostbusters franchise
Jul 16 2016,positive,thought it was great on its own
Jul 16 2016,positive,great great fun and funny
Jul 16 2016,positive,it was freaking awesome i couldnt stop laughing and it was great to see some of the cast from previous films come back
Jul 16 2016,positive,a lot better then i expected
Jul 16 2016,positive,honestly i had a fantastic time watching this movie alot of fun most fun ive had the cinema in awhile
Jul 16 2016,negative,quite unhappy with it this film had everything going for it good actors a brand name sweet vfx but in the end it all mesh together the way it could have the dialogue of this film is terrible everyone is trying to be funny in a film i feel should have been more serious and scary that being said the times when the ghostbusters are fighting the monsters are probably the best parts of the film everything else felt like filler
Jul 16 2016,positive,it was definitely geared towards a female audience but there were plenty of laughs for dudes as well as nostalgia for the original fans
Jul 16 2016,positive,pleasantly surprised by this super funny take on a classic totally worth seeing in 3d no one throw tomatoes at me but i think it was better than the original
Jul 16 2016,positive,i would love to see all these comedians and all of them are such great actors i think theyll do a great job so who you gonna call
Jul 16 2016,positive,as a reboot of the original movie this female cast of ghostbusters did really well to stand as its own movie instead of trying to chase the coattails of the original its full of laughs clever dialogue action and so many cameos that this movie was just a fun ride and deserved the theater applause that it received when the final credits rolled
Jul 16 2016,positive,my kids and i could not stop laughing theyve seen the originals but all said this one was much funnier i felt very excited watching everything happening and loved seeing such strong characters on the screen that had actual growth beyond their initial character setup kids immediately asked if we would buy it when it came out online and want to go see again as soon as we canafford
Jul 16 2016,positive,this is almost better than the original
Jul 16 2016,negative,i am glad i saw it in a theatre but i never have to watch it again
Jul 16 2016,positive,it was a really good summer blockbuster i thought it might just be fun for the kids but i was laughing for most of the movie and got pretty nostalgic with all the cameos
Jul 16 2016,negative,a poor effort at remaking a classic
Jul 16 2016,neutral,stupid comedy  if you like bridesmaids youll like this  dont see a problem with it being compared to the original ghostbusters  its basically a gender swapped remake with poor writing and  deadpan jokes  not that the original was shakespeare but it was funnier and had better flow  its a good forgettable summer movie
Jul 16 2016,positive,best film ive seen in a long time the reverse smurfette syndrome was realy refreshing and it was highly entertaining the visuals were on point and the characters were unique and different the first movie made me fall asleep but this one got me on the edge of my seat the whole time through
Jul 16 2016,negative,pretty bad to be honest its probably my fault i didnt enjoy the jokes as they seem they seem to be intended for little kids also too much green screen and the special effects werent that good either should have skipped this one
Jul 16 2016,positive,well that wasnt terrible is literally the last line in the ghostbusters good news its true mccarthy whig mckinnon and jones with an assist from hemsworth have plenty of lol moments mccarthy is sometimes overthetop and too inclined to physical slapstick but at times she dials it back and lets the other ladies step forward with this many funny people somebody has got to be the straight character sometimes once again i think kristen whig is overrated comedically mckinnons manic mad scientist character is actually perfect with some of the most difficult line of technobabble since star trek next generation there is a section where the action was starting to kick into climax mode near the end in which whigs character is running around being just tedious then at the end the movie got its feet under it again in a well collaborative effort on screen and off i dont say this often i loved the 3d not the ectoplasm coming out of the screen so much there were just tons of background items with visual interesting additive presence there are plenty of jokes that miss the mark the combination of melissa mcmarthy and director paul feig who also made spy seems to work their work in bridesmaids including whig didnt thrill me so much but some people seem to like it this is a pretty fun movie note to rick moranis why didnt you join the party everybody was there note to you reading this stay through the end credits what if i tell you dopinder the cabbie from deadpool delivers won ton soup in this movie
Jul 16 2016,positive,the trailers sucked so bad i almost didnt go but the movie was a lot of fun and i loved the cameos of the original cast rick moranis you should have said yes
Jul 16 2016,negative,sorry for the short review but i feel like putting as much effort into this as they did this movie
Jul 16 2016,positive,rather interesting with great cg for the ghosts plot was rather cliche and not that clever giving it a 35
Jul 16 2016,negative,political correctness run amok
Jul 16 2016,positive,its not terrible but its definitely better then ghostbusters 2
Jul 16 2016,positive,wow what a great movie so funny absolutely loved kate mckinnon performance
Jul 16 2016,positive,ghostbusters answer the call is a fun and adventurous film that showcases the comedic talents of the funniest women working in hollywood today while it follows the story foundation of the original 1984 classic it offers a fresh and visually entertaining new addition to the ghostbusters universe i would have liked to see more ghost encounterscaptured in montage form what was presented in screen was exceptionally well done  the genuine chemistry shared by the main characters is the heart that keeps this film beating strong by the time the film ends youll be rooting for the underdog ghostbusters too
Jul 16 2016,positive,the plot of the movie was very disappointing and lack luster but what saved the movie for me were the 4 leads in the movie they were so funny if the story was better this movie could have been the summers biggest hit
Jul 16 2016,negative,a movie with a feminist agenda
Jul 16 2016,positive,we had heard that it was not great but the five of us that just went ranging in age from 8 to 48 but it was awesome the only reason it didnt get five stars is because some of the scenes dragged on just a little too long humor was great and casting was awesome
Jul 16 2016,positive,great movie but it could have been more funny
Jul 16 2016,positive,not as bad i thought it would be it was fun i am a fan of the first ones and was anxious about it though
Jul 16 2016,positive,the cast is electric and have an amazing energry that is fun to watch i enjoyed myself watching this movie and loved all the call backs to the original
Jul 16 2016,positive,its not a bad movie its just average  leslie jones made me laugh but not much else did  the younger teenaged people in the audience appeared to find it much funnier than i did
Jul 16 2016,negative,anyone who has seen the original knows that this film is trash in comparison poorly written poorly acted and overblown special effects just because they can do them pass on it in the theatre dont waste your money on this
Jul 16 2016,positive,i have never seen the original but this film works great as a standalone kate mckinnon and leslie jones shine in there roles chuckles throughout
Jul 16 2016,negative,movie was shit overhyped
Jul 16 2016,positive,loved chris hemsworth
Jul 16 2016,positive,this movie was a lot of fun plain and simple
Jul 16 2016,positive,laughed a lot and feel is close to original for me definitely blows ghostbusters 2 out of the water
Jul 16 2016,positive,the comic sensibility the relationships and individual voices of this movie made it a smart enjoyable comedy well worth your time and money if you are a fan of bridesmaids which i did not find particularly funny or enjoyable then you may be disappointed as it is a different kind of humor i however enjoyed seeing women act as scientists friends comediennes and warriors against ghosts
Jul 16 2016,positive,is this a great movie  no  but its also not a bad movie  it has some good comedy the dance scene behind the credits at the end is very funny the post credit end of movie scene is a nice touch  the real problem is we all know what the original movie is like  so while this movie does change things the overall plot is something we can guess no surprises  and that unfortunately reduces the overall rating as it feels like a repeat  still if you can see this at the matinee showings to keep the cost down i think youll like it and most people will be happy they saw the film
Jul 16 2016,positive,this movie is amazing as somebody who bleeds ectoplasm i was expecting a lot from this movie and it went so far above and beyond my expectations it took every idea the first movie laid out and took them to the next level i got chills watching everything unfold and i uglylaughed far more than id like to admit i can tell you as someone who has been a ghostbusters fan since before she could talk  someone who decorated her car like the ectomobile in high school and isnt embarrassed about it  i tell you with full sincerity that i enjoyed this film more than than the original the original will always be special to me and this probably wouldnt have happened without it but there is no doubt in my mind that this movie surpasses it in all ways take all of my money
Jul 16 2016,positive,it was a silly funny movie good story line and great cast of actors endorsed by the original cast who made cameo appearances i liked it
Jul 16 2016,neutral,not awful not great either
Jul 16 2016,positive,good but not great first half is funny then it becomes generic good special effects
Jul 16 2016,negative,most jokes fall flat boring movie
Jul 16 2016,positive,lots of fun a great combination of different types of humor ill probably see it again when i need a pickmeup
Jul 16 2016,positive,this movie was very funny and a lot of fun the relationships between the characters felt very genuine and the dialogue was very witty the plot was ridiculous and over the top but thats what you want from this type of movie the scenes flowed well however and it never felt like they jumped around oddly it was refreshing to see a female driven movie not about romance
Jul 16 2016,negative,this movie struggles from ever leaving the shadows of the original the characters themselves arent really so bad example i think kate mckinnon and chris hemsworth are very good in the film but the others completely fall short mccarthy and wig are just not very good to me but the most disappointing was leslie jones i think and this is just my opinion as a black person which is why i basically created this whole account so i could leave this one specific tidbit feels downright offensive like her character felt like someone who was like hey lets make a movie that propels women further in hollywood and the person that this person was talking to said yea i like that idea then the original guy follows up but lets add a really offensive and stereotypical black person character and tada there goes black people representation i dont know maybe its just me but i feel alot of the people giving this 5 stars are just doing it because of the all female cast and this tidbit of quite racist and sterotypical background should give people pause but i guess since its just black people its to be expected or something i dont know    anyways the rest of the movie does have some good funny jokes i actually laughed more than i expected was disappointed in the fart joke tier jokes though there is alot lacking in this film however i think the worst part was when they were basically bashing their audience and it really took me out i mean i was hopeful in coming to this film thinking hey maybe its better than the awful trailers and it is the problem though is that its just not good or bad its perfectly mediocre the only reason i think its so bad is because it takes so many opportunities to bash on people and encourage stereotypes that it is kinda offensive go see the film if you know nothing about ghost busters but just be prepared to be offended if you have any thought about equality in the sexes and how black people are portrayed i wish i could give it a better score and a better review or a more comprehensive review but i wanted to get this off my chest while its still fresh and justi just feel so disappointing cause i was really hoping that maybe a black character in a highly advertised highly hoped upon film reduced to a blithering stereotype that does nothing for the film paul feig and whatever writers were involved have proved that they dont think highly of black people and think that audience intelligence is that of fart jokes and poop jokes there were some good jokes and some good moments that were genuinely funny but this movie is simply too mediocre
Jul 16 2016,positive,starring 4 very funny woman and a surprisingly funny chris hemsworth they did not disappoint  many subtle off the cuff jokes which worked mostly   and not a lot of over the top hit you over the head comedy which can be very hit or miss  big problem i am currently having with a lot of movies is how the hero explains how they are going to win in the climax of the movie spewing a lot of technobabble that cannot possibly be understood by the audience  frankly i cannot believe how the hero figures these things out and of course the possibility of it working is next to nothing but it always does  i need something a little more clever and logical nowadays  if you need an example see the ending of every episode of the flash
Jul 16 2016,negative,i would like my money back my friend convinced me that it was going to be funny but it fell so flat it was plain cringeworthy to watch i will never get that time back it probably would have been better if leslie jones was written a better character then the painfully stereotypical patty it was almost bordering on a racist portrayal
Jul 16 2016,positive,its a mistake to go to films with expectations this film is enjoyable in its own right and we thoroughly enjoyed it i would recommend this film to anyone with an open mind
Jul 16 2016,negative,terrible terrible movie ratings seem to be not based on the actual movie but on some reaction towards the sexist comments from a minority of youtubers this does nothing but mislead people into spending cash on this cashgrab
Jul 16 2016,positive,i had fun with this movie beginning to end
Jul 16 2016,positive,it isnt bad but it isnt good either even if you remove the ghostbusters expectations you wont leave with a favorite quote or favorite scene the movie just kind of happens hemsworth steals the show in his limited scenes the cameos are nice but honestly could be better
Jul 16 2016,positive,a truly enjoyable funny and well acted movie i enjoyed an early screening of this movie and can not wait to go see it several more times kate mckinnon is a gem and honestly one of my favorite parts of the movie
Jul 16 2016,positive,such a great movie the ghosts were scary and the ghostbusters were funny  i loved the original movie when i was younger and i think this was a great homage it was very different and thats good every negative review ive seen either says that they hated it on principle because they shiuldnt have remade it or that they hate to see 4 women instead of 4 men to those reviewers i say grow up
Jul 16 2016,positive,good but too quick an ending 
Jul 16 2016,positive,left the theater thoroughly pleased laughed throughout the film and my childhood is intact
Jul 16 2016,positive,loved it it was hilarious and well done
Jul 16 2016,negative,fell asleep at the end
Jul 16 2016,neutral,it was ok but was a bit disappointed  the originals are so much better  the characters got lost in the movie  they did not have the comradery as the originals
Jul 16 2016,negative,the director is mean to its fans and this spreads feminist propaganda
Jul 16 2016,negative,makes a mockery of the original
Jul 16 2016,positive,aside from bring littered with nostalgia and salutes to the original ghostbusters was upheld by the hilarity of the cast and the importance of all female maincharacters i have to say that watching 4 amazing female characters kick ass against an army of ghosts has given me something no other movie has that i can recall  this new ghostbusters was an absolute treat its not perfect by any means but it is something special
Jul 16 2016,positive,great and funny movie
Jul 16 2016,positive,sceptical at first but came away from the cinema absolutely loving it
Jul 16 2016,positive,the premise was ridiculous but lots of silly humor special  effects and good music i laughed through 80 of the movie there was about 10 minute scene near end with the ghosts i found boring and unnecessary     
Jul 16 2016,positive,nothing is perfect but this reboot is pretty great the female cast is perfect and chris hemsworth is perfect
Jul 16 2016,negative,another real stinker the critics are trying to prop up
Jul 16 2016,negative,a terrible blend of visuals and humor
Jul 16 2016,positive,pays homage to the original without being a total rehash top notch performances from the entire cast great writing funny all the way through it was truly a great movie a few of the cameos seemed inorganic and a few of jokes that didnt land quite as well as they were meant to but the good definitely outweighed the bad kristen wiig and melissa mccarthy were in top form but leslie jones and kate mckinnon stole the show all four actresses had great chemistry and i cant wait to see a sequel
Jul 16 2016,negative,a few laughoutloud moments and a lot of good will and hope cant cover up the fact that this is just a bad movie poor pacing overly broad sitcomlevel comedy and a climax that leaves you cold these women are super funny  they deserve a better movie than this
Jul 16 2016,positive,watching this i wished i were a little girl again so i could have grown up with these badass hilarious women as role models i am so jealous of my nieces i laughed so hard all the way through the cameos were well done and didnt detract but enriched the movie i cant wait for the sequel until then ill just have to watch this one again and again
Jul 16 2016,positive,fun movie it could not have been done any better
Jul 16 2016,positive,off the bat its not as good as the original  it has a different tone style of humor and is more slapsticky like the cartoon rather than the previous movies that said its a lot of fun if you can get past all the technical jargon melissa mccarthys character throws at the audience the effects look fantastic on the big screen patty and hotlzman stole the show for me they were by far the best characters with the funniest situations give the movie a try you might like it
Jul 16 2016,positive,i loved the movie  acting was spot on for all the characters it was fun seeing the various cameo appearances the role reversal for the genders having a beefcake receptionist was enlightening and hilarious i could see a sequel
Jul 16 2016,positive,exactly what i love in a movie fun funky a little goofy hilarious and filled with action
Jul 16 2016,positive,kate mckinnon needs all the fame
Jul 16 2016,positive,yay funny and they didnt screw it up good job
Jul 16 2016,negative,i really wish i would not have bothered wasting money on this movie  every joke is at the expense of men  even the way the movie ends  the cameos from the original cast are pathetically painful  you can literally see the lawsuit that compelled them to appear in this horrendous nightmare on their faces      the cgi was probably done by amateurs  the storyline is dreadfully backhanded and acting is poor  mccarthys worst performance in her career whig phoned this one in and holy crap why is leslie jones on anything anytime  who is telling her that she has talent  jones is walking single punchline that is repetitive loud and obnoxious      the only redeeming quality is the performance of kate mckinnon  she is funny quick and totally enjoyable  everything else  meh
Jul 16 2016,negative,i like the girl twist  cast but the story sucked a disservice to the original 
Jul 16 2016,positive,not a perfect film but its decent it captures a lot of the feel of the original and theres a lot of fan service in there too its not going to win any oscars but its worth watching if youre looking for a popcorn film and havent already made up your mind about it before seeing it
Jul 16 2016,negative,some funny lines and cool effectsghosts but the vibe strays quite a bit from classic ghostbusters more like quirky sitcomsketch banter with characters superficiallydisposable involved in the plotcircumstances  felt forced like an exercise rather than organic plotcharactersexperience
Jul 16 2016,positive,retains the tone general plot level of seriousness and level of special effects of the original but is an entirely new and hilarious movie great for summer fun and laughs
Jul 16 2016,positive,great fun with as far as i can tell humor that doesnt make anybody a bullied butt of any joke but has loads of laughs and some good effects an homage to brains and invention  nerds rise up
Jul 16 2016,positive,these women are hilarious
Jul 16 2016,negative,terrible movie with lazy writing and stale jokes seriously this movie is only getting positive reviews because of the all female cast
Jul 16 2016,negative,with childish jokes that kids would cringe at little to no chemistry between the main characters and a complete lack of imagination this is a poor use of the name ghostbusters and what many would see as a cash in on the franchise
Jul 16 2016,positive,its not the original you have to go in realizing that with that understanding they did a great job paying proper homage to them while keeping it current
Jul 16 2016,negative,what a waste of time and money horrible script talent wasted ladies from snl
Jul 16 2016,negative,ok plot bad acting wasent worth seeing
Jul 16 2016,negative,this movie tried way too hard to be funny it has moments but like its new remixed theme song it suffers too much from being something its not it tried to force nostalgia and failed and it tried to be funny and failed its just not a good movie by any stretch of the imagination
Jul 16 2016,positive,a surprisingly funny movie that manages to entertain you for the entire time even though certain elements are borrowed from other movies and not every joke hits
Jul 16 2016,positive,loved the movie seeing it again tomorrow very funny good plot loved the cameos enjoyed it throughout the entire film
Jul 16 2016,positive,confession time ive never watched the original all the way through so i didnt come to this reboot with fears about tarnishing a beloved classic as some people did im a fan of mccarthy wiig and director fieg and pretty appalled at the internet trolls who have managed to hijack the imdb rating and dominated message boards   this film is a fun romp with appealing if slightly muted performances from mccarthy and wiig kate mckinnon being the standout of the 4 leads the film suffers from  marvelitis in that the huge cgi climactic battle goes on much too long  although at least here it is much more for laughs than for city destroying spectacle the plot is minimal and character development skimpy chris hemsworth as himbo secretary kevin is a giggle and kate mckinnon as chief inventor holtzmann is having the best time overall this was very enjoyable but not earth shatteringly hilarious however so nice to have a film with such great female characters who arent chasing a man or wearing skin tight jumpsuits holtzmann rocks
Jul 16 2016,negative,my girlfriend really wanted to see this movie so she took me to see it i was reluctant but i agreed since it looked like it was getting positive reviews huge mistake the entire movie made me cringe and im pretty sure my girlfriend ended up hating it more than i did huge slap in the face to ghostbusters fans dont waste your money or time
Jul 16 2016,positive,enjoyed it  had the movie written off as soon as it was announced but i have been proven wrong good fun and lots of funny moments and likeable characters
Jul 16 2016,negative,my incredible attraction to kristen wiig appreciation for hemsworth and melissa mccarthy and hollywood trying to present these characters as intelligent ghostbusters fails its far too goofy far too flat and lacks all of the spirit that made the original an instant classic
Jul 16 2016,negative,wow wanted to like this and expected better after the reviews but where was anything remotely humorous
Jul 16 2016,negative,i loved the reverse sexism terrible villian and cringe worthy humor who the hell was this movie made for it didnt appeal to ghostbuster fans and it didnt appeal to mainstream moviegoers i think the whole controversy surrounding this movie before its release was made to draw more attention to this movie which ultimately was just another forgettable reboot like robocop total recall and the karate kid
Jul 16 2016,positive,a fun summer flick  found myself laughing and spooked out more than i expected  i happened to see it in 3d they made decent use of depth  loved the upgraded ghostbusteresque effects too  there were a couple punch lines i could have done without but i was laughing throughout  i dont know why exactly that trailer initially turned me off but there were def some better shotsmoments in the film they could have used  overall i was pleasantly surprised
Jul 16 2016,positive,i hated the trailer much better than i was expecting open mind
Jul 16 2016,negative,saw this movie today erm no just no dont waste your money
Jul 16 2016,negative,blatant activist feminism hope this franchise dies quickly
Jul 16 2016,negative,this was pretty awful
Jul 16 2016,positive,the new ghostbusters was freaking hilarious i had a smile on my face the whole movie the 4 female comedians worked as a team to pull off this comedy and the cameos from former gbs were perfectly timed i cannot believe at the user score is so low dont believe those people you will laugh a lot and there is bonus footage at the end
Jul 16 2016,negative,there is nothing wrong with an all female cast they had everything they needed to make a good movie instead they made a poor cgi mess that spends the entire time trying to attack men you dont need to put down men to promote women
Jul 16 2016,positive,it was actually quite funny
Jul 16 2016,positive,if  youre comparing the new movie to the old youre doing it wrong the movie was cleverly written with the equal balance of smart humor and silly tongueincheek the theater audience laughed loudly congrats to the cast and crew
Jul 16 2016,neutral,a movie with this cast should be way funnier film looked great and the script was great
Jul 16 2016,negative,this is not the movie fans asked for this would of been better it they made it its own thing but the continual references to events of the classic movies made a lot of the content shoehorned in i feelnas if it would of been better to keepnthis same cast but make it in a world 20 years after the original movies took place and have them build their own story instead of rebuilding an old one
Jul 16 2016,negative,ugh this movie is painful the jokes fall flat it just felt like a long snl skit the man hating in this film is over the top all men are either stupid or evil
Jul 16 2016,negative,idc if im called a sexist but f this movie
Jul 16 2016,negative,hollywood again takes the magic of the original film and shits all over it for an attempt at a quick buck  this movie will be lucky to make its money back and forever be another stain on the franchise of ghostbusters a franchise that really consists of 1 very good movie from 1984
Jul 16 2016,positive,genuinely hilarious
Jul 16 2016,neutral,not as astonishingly a failure like batman v superman it ultimately falls flat it has been hyping itself as feminist but relies almost entirely on misandry even fart and dick jokes fail the script is lame and direction is awful the actresses deserve credit for trying to turn chicken shit into chicken salad they look like they are enjoying themselves half the time and look bored the rest its full of product placement  and pandering to the chinese market as all blockbusters due these day everything feels forced the cameos are awkard its a shame its a fun popcorn movie but youll be wanting for something more
Jul 16 2016,positive,this was never going to be anything like the original but this still stands as a really fun and enjoyable movie
Jul 16 2016,negative,cool visuals but dont go for the laughs they fall flat 95 of the time maybe even 96
Jul 16 2016,positive,funny great cast well made entertaining from the opening through the credits better than the original
Jul 16 2016,positive,it was amazing  so funny  the ladies are cohesive  comedy gold
Jul 16 2016,positive,this movie was hilarious and just phenomenal
Jul 16 2016,positive,i dont know what all the low ratings are from i laughed a lot and really enjoyed it
Jul 16 2016,positive,its a very fun standalone comedy with great nods to the original
Jul 16 2016,negative,unbelievable how pc can make its way into critics reviews for a movie  this movie doesnt make you laugh nor will it be a fraction to the original but because it is progressive critics dont want to post a negative review  man up boys
Jul 16 2016,positive,the movie plays homage to the original with nostalgia and cameos that are nicely placed throughout the movie  it also stands alone as a fresh look at a beloved franchise  this movie is a very entertaining movie and is everything you expect out of a fun summer popcorn flick
Jul 16 2016,positive,not a terrible movie at all   okay so not very many remakes are ever as good as the first and thats the case with the new ghost busters movie however it was fun and family friendly all the cast members were funny to watch and brought their own unique qualities to the movie the ghosts were fun as well and we even got to see some old familiar faces definitely worth checking out
Jul 16 2016,positive,enjoyable enough thanks to the charisma of the leads but suffers in comparison to the original
Jul 16 2016,negative,boring  by far melissas worst performance they tried so hatd to make this movie like the original that it lacked in any and every way
Jul 16 2016,negative,girls rules women are funny get over it now get over those dank audience scores
Jul 16 2016,positive,really funny with a great cast  dont listen to the negative reviews those people are blinded by nostalgia
Jul 16 2016,positive,this movie is fun you got amazing funny actors great special effects and a great story to put it all together dont let the haters get you down go see this movie and just have a blast
Jul 16 2016,positive,amazing film it had better pacing than either of the original ghostbusters films comedy gold 
Jul 16 2016,negative,while not as awful as tomy wiseaus the room that film had something it was so bad it was actually hilarious this movie however fails to deliver any laughs whatsoever it is a disgrace to the original two movies which had legends such as bill murray and harold ramis it is also blatantly obvious the message they were trying to give the audience any more obvious and the characters would be slapping you in the face with it its simply a film made to tame to modern sjw feminist tat believes that any group thats all male is triggering and opressed
Jul 16 2016,positive,the original ghostbusters movies have been in my top ten favourite ever since i saw them in the cinema as a teenager i had high hopes for the remake despite all the largely confected hate prior to its opening and i wasnt disappointed a great cast lots of truly laugh out loud moments superb fx  especially in 3d  and some very welljudged and beautifully integrated shoutouts to the original nice cameos from five of the original cast too thoroughly enjoyed it sure it wont supplant the originals in my personal pantheon but its a worthy addition to the canon and a terrific popcorn movie in its own right my advice ignore the naysayers and go see it
Jul 16 2016,positive,hilarious a super fun movie on its own but honors the original with great cameos  references i laughed throughout the movie  cant wait to see it again
Jul 16 2016,positive,i actually thought this movie was great and i grew up on the originals  i went in not expecting much but thought it was really funny and had a good amount of ghost scenes  i took my little boy and he loved it too  i wish they would have played the original song one more time but it was still cool    leslie jones was hilariousthe stage dive scene had me laughing    if you gave this a bad review youre taking life way too seriously and need to lighten the f up 
Jul 16 2016,positive,good funny but not close to the original
Jul 16 2016,positive,pay no attention to the reviews from people who saw the movie before it was actually released  this is a funny comedy that tried something new and succeeded  give it a watch
Jul 16 2016,positive,bestthe incredible cast especially the surprisingly funny chris hemsworth as well as a great script that gives the cast a lot to work with worst the cgi mess of all the ghosts really bogs down the end of the movie overall very enjoyable though of course not holding up to the original
Jul 16 2016,positive,i very much enjoyed this film  i was a nice modern twist on a classic  though the film is ghostbusters i didnt feel like that were trying to be something they arent  it isnt your fathers ghostbusters but it could be yours  certainly had some very entertaining laughs  i would say give it a shot  a lot of the reviews here are from people who havent seen the film but heard it sucked  dont let the trolls make you miss out on a great film  go see it
Jul 16 2016,negative,it was terrible the movie was a goofy comedy reminiscent of caddy shack and the heat all of the original ghostbusters made appearances except egon  the only thing is that they had wierd unrelated jobs like funeral director and ghost critic  the staypuft marshmallow man wasnt even made of marshmallow  he was a macys day paradestyle balloon  please do not pay the high prices of a movie theatre on this movie  rent it at best  disappointing terrible flop  i was so hopeful and excited but was grossly let down  to producer dan akroyd your plot sucked you should be ashamed of yourself
Jul 16 2016,positive,the reboot theme has been happening a lot recently but this film does it rather well its a strong cast and clever dialogue its not just a repeat of the classic but its own story will see again
Jul 16 2016,positive,i enjoyed the ride and the sexualization of chris hemsworth the ladies did a great job i couldnt help but smile
Jul 16 2016,negative,so sad to see the movie of my youth being butchered like this just sad
Jul 16 2016,positive,more like gutbusters amiright     seriously though not all of the jokes may land as intended but in a relatively grim summer movie season this was a welcome blast of fun that both honors the original and treads new ground it cant hold a candle to the brilliant original but heres hoping they are more successful with the inevitable sequel than the guys were
Jul 16 2016,positive,hilarious a great movie on its own but honors the original with great cameos  references i laughed throughout the movie  cant wait to see it again
Jul 16 2016,positive,hilarious chris hemsworth is underused and kate mckinnon totally steals every scene shes in set aside your expectations and just go for a laugh
Jul 16 2016,positive,this movie did a brilliant job of nodding to nostalgia while also standing independently it wasnt just a recasting of the same characters with a gender swap but new and interesting characters playing similar roles ive seen a lot of reviews from angry men arguing that its ruining their childhood to recast the reboot with women however as a girl in the 80s and 90s i loved the ghostbusters movies and cartoon but i didnt identify with them seeing women in those roles made the franchise more inclusive to me not exclusive of other peoples childhood memories
Jul 16 2016,positive,very funny action packed and definitely in line with the original films   the 3d is great i suggest seeing it in 3d imax if you can handle it
Jul 16 2016,positive,lets get one thing straight before i write my full review shame on haters of this movie this is a new story and plot of the origin of the ghostbusters most people on here are ripping it apart for no reason     the movie has consistent comedy by having the right cast kate mckinnon and leslie jones act as the best of the main cast while liam hemsworth does a surprising jobs as a comedic side character     the plot as makes sense and creates its own story without stealing the original story from the 1984 original more of these review would be negative in my opinion if they took the original story     my only gripe on this film is the product placement i particularly am not a fan of this way of making cash but i was able to allow it to slide based on the writing and comedy     overall it truly deserves the score i gave it its a solid movie with great comedy and an excellent casting i would also like to note that i am an avid fan of the original the original is still better but since it is technically a different story it would be wrong to review it based on that film
Jul 16 2016,negative,total garbage  wow completely ruined what the original started film had no purpose or reasoning for anything great cast in a wasted effort  few laughs here and there but most punchlines were so telegraphed i was saying them minutes before the actor smh dont waste your money please 2 stars only for cameos
Jul 16 2016,positive,saw this with my 9 year old daughter  we both loved it  i will definitely be buying it when it comes out on video
Jul 16 2016,positive,honestly hilarious film tough to say if it was as good as the original but on its own it stands up very well
Jul 16 2016,negative,paul feig has done the only thing that paul feig is capable of doing and thats make a mediocre film that is only relevant because look women are doing the things that men usually do in a movie if you were to replace the females in all of paul feigs films with men they would be straight to redbox caliber at best shockingly enough ghostbusters 2k16 is the poster child for this logic the pandering stunt casting in this film is only bested by the god awful writing and directing paul feig is adam sandler movie level talent nothing more
Jul 16 2016,positive,it had almost the entire cast from the original ghostbusters and everything i wanted to see
Jul 16 2016,positive,solid film  funny  kate mckinnon was hilarious
Jul 16 2016,negative,wow i didnt think it was possible for a major studio to make a movie this bad
Jul 16 2016,positive,great job bringing back the ghostbusters non stop laughs
Jul 16 2016,positive,this movie was pretty awesome rotten tomato rating is wrong it should be at least 75 people in the theater clapped at  the end and laughed a lot
Jul 16 2016,negative,i felt strongly enough about this movie to make it my first review i went in with decent expectations but it is really really dreadful the joke attempts are completely broad dont work and moreover found my self literally groaning out loud     i left early and found out arclight cinemas dont give refunds in these cases
Jul 16 2016,positive,haters gonna hate but i actually really liked this movie i went in with very low expectations and was pleasantly surprised kate mckinnon leslie jones and chris hemsworth made the movie for me and were all hilarious the 3d effects were good without being too much we also sat in the dbox seats at our theater so it really gave you an extra jolt during some of the action scenes so no its isnt the original but it was really fun just the same
Jul 16 2016,positive,the new ghostbusters film is a fun and silly romp wrapped in ectoplasmic love although it never comes close to the perfection of the original film most cinema goers will find it an enjoyable experience mckinnons egonesque performance stands out though surprising me with many laughs was chris hemsworth in the not too bright secretary role the effects use of cgi and even the 3d felt well handled there are some great comedic moments as well as some callbacks to the original for the die hard fans i had some issues with pacing wasnt totally sold on the villain and found the final act to be kind of lame and predictable overall however i was charmed by the new cast and really appreciated how much respect and care was given to breathe new life into this 30 year old franchise i even think it may be better than ghostbusters 2 haters gonna hate  but if you hate the new ghostbusters  you probably just hate life 710
Jul 16 2016,positive,it was fantastic and i hope they do another movie soon
Jul 16 2016,positive,i find it really really funny and enjoyable kate mckinnons character is awesome
Jul 16 2016,positive,really funny pays tribute to the original in a fresh and appealing way
Jul 16 2016,positive,huge fan of the originals and the cartoon and i absolutely adored the reboot it was hilarious and fun with a ton of nods to the original if you cant enjoy this gem you probably never really like gbs to begin with cant wait to watch it again
Jul 16 2016,neutral,in an age of good reboots ie the force awakensmore so a rebootsequel and bad reboots ie total recall poltergeist etc none of those movies is as big or as controversial as the ghostbusters rebootim sorry reimagined     originally ghostbusters started out with two guys and a gorilla yeah i remember that one lmao and then was rebooted to the one we know as the ghostbusters back in 1984 which for a movie that was campy and used subtle humor in the mist of the scary vibe it was a fun and engaging movie that became not just a sleeper hit of the day but a cult classic till this day i think anyone who have seen the original would say the same     but thanks to sony amy pascal and paul feig we gotsomething     before i start this review i want to put a disclaimer cause i feel like i have to with all the craziness behind the making of this film as well as the things that was placed in this moviei have nothing but love for the four female main cast  and with that said i will give you the good bad and overall of this movie cause i feel that most top critics can be very jaded and see what they want to see instead of looking at the picture as a whole ex girl power get over it insulting people is uncalled for in reviewsand insulting people who are giving you money to see your movie is also unwarranted but thats neither here or there     so im guessing youre asking why did i give this 2 12  stars out of five   well lets start with the good    the good    the first half of this film shows promise that this could be a fun ghostbusters movie i felt the chemistry between the four leads mckinnon wiig jones and mccarthy was refreshing and fun and for a moment it felt like how the original four gb of the day there were some chuckle moments ex the youtube ghost are real moment and chris hemsworth as the dimwitted kevin has his time to shine at best ex when he gives idea for the new symbols via the sony laptop the technologyweapons were on point because its like this i like it when a movie shows how the tech was made and the testing behind it something unfortunately the original never showed it showed they had an idea for a proton pack but never how it was made and that was cool its an enjoyable sight to see kate mckinnon as the wacky egon type of the group jillian holtzmann the brains behind the weapons  shes kooky and cute at the same time and leslie joneswellshe has her moments and she does stand out something ive felt that winston in the past needed to bringim not talking about being the stereotype but im talking about being vocal in the group not just being in the background but i dont blame the actor i blame the script and if i didnt mention kristen wiig and melissa mccarthy as erin gilbert and abby yates respectfully thats because their kinship was the most closest ive been since the original days with bill murray and harold ramis in stripes and during its first half on the film you see the uniqueness shining thru for all four and how the ghostbusters are formed and in that moment i actually saw potential     but thenthings took a bad turn very fast     the bad    ii dont know where to start honestly i dont know how i can actually describe it for a movie that had a good promise of a fun and somewhat creepy movie it had one eerie moment in the movie i forgot to mentioned in the good section i still dont see what the top critics or reviewers are seeing unless if they are not blinded by the whole gender swapping thing or insulting people cause of how good the movie is   this movie for all intent and purpose never manages to stand on its own two feet even when in the first half of the film it shows that it has the potential to do just that but all that goes away once they capture their first ghost and then all logic story and everything else just is pushed aside for a political campaign of man bashing bad pacing bad editing and overall hit and miss jokes     heres the thing i dont care if its an allfemale cast even though i would have rather preferred three woman and one guy or two guys and two ladies to make it progressivewhat i do care about is that if the story setup villain and struggleschallenges will make the movie work my biggest fear was that this reboot would try very hard to be like the original so much that it technically doesnt do that much that is original by its own merit if that makes sense and a queef joke really i get you want to put at least some adult humor but when your first jokeis a fart jokei already got the initial impression of where this movie was about to go and heres the thing again i dont blame the actress cause they are doing what they can with the amount of script they have and sometimes the jokes seems to come off either adlib or sometimes forced which leads to hit and miss jokes and thats what the majority of the second and third half of this movie produces it wasnt subtle and it didnt hit its mark at times which in some parts ive chuckled at moments and then by the second and third half of the movie and im being honestmost of the people in the theater i was in wasnt laughing only some   leslie jones as patty was pretty much the female tracy morgan and the millions of other stereotypes tropes that plague afroamericans in comedies while she stands out in the film to be as part of the team she also stands out in the negative light as well when your belt buckle says oh no you didntthats a problem when erin says we three are scientistincluding patty thats a problem     and i get it patty is an mta workerpossible historian buff so she knows her stuff about nyc which is obvious its bostonbut thats neither here or there but that doesnt warranted her behavior and demeanor to be straight outta compton but this leads me to the reason behind it cause i dont blame the actress for this i blame the bigger enemythe script   paul feig and kate dippold written the majority of this script and i have to be honest with you its not the best script for numerous reasons    1 obvious manbashing i get it paul as a kid grew up dealing with being bullied for the fact of his last name and who he is he even referenced it in a interview stating he doesnt like male bonding in anything since he was more comfortable with femalesand you kinda get some of  that when you are introduced to the main villain rowan played by neil casey who was picked on and bullied as a kid but this is the problem i know some directors put a bit of their past experiences in the movies but the difference between them and feig is that most directorsproducers are subtle with itwith feig not so muchfor the near 2 hours of this movie the 999 percent of males in this movie are depicted as aholes lazy scared selfish stupid or all of the above ernie hudsons character as pattys uncle might get off the hook cause it wasnt that bad and the connection with patty and her uncle made me chuckle but you do not put your personal hate in the movie and then behind the scene publicized the people who didnt like this movie for reasonable reasons as being sexist misogynistic woman hating and do literally and exactly the same thing in your movie   two wrongs do not make a right     and the sad part to this is that ive read and seen most of these reviews and most are either naive to it scared to talk about so they brush it away or oblivious that its actually happening and thats scary     look im all for empowering woman in movie form cause i feel that any little girl should have a role model and hero to look up tobut the way paul feig is doing it is way different and far more harsh and bias than what jj abrams did to rey in the force awakens which was subtle and natural which made rey as a whole a bad ass telling woman or insinuating that all men are idiots assholes and scary cats in your movies is a unfair approach in making your heroes valid it just comes off as if you have a personal grudge which shouldnt be placed in film that suppose to be fun action packed and engaging   cause when the male and females left my theater all of themall of them asked the same question why it feels as if every man in the movie was stupid  so i have to ask what do reviewers see that i dont aside from seeing what they want to see that paul insinuated that every man is dumb ignorant lazy unreliable or a villainous asshole  and when you make everyone stupid or otherwise this is what happens next       2 the central heroes dont feel heroic  syndrome from the incredibles said it best and if everyone is special no one will be  its pretty much the exact same thing but in reverse every hero needs a challenge to have them question if what they are doing is a good idea if the road they are taking the right decision in the original ghostbusters 1984 the team was dealing with everythinga rise in ghost activity a epa worker who wanted to shut them down two possessed people by a demigod a city about to be destroyed and on top of thatget thrown in jail by the mayor    for spangler zeddmore veinkman and stanz had the odds stacked against them and for peter it was very personal cause the woman he was interested in was one of the possessed so the stakes were high when fighting gozer the sumerian god but in ghostbusters answer the call there were none of that    no challenge no sense of doubt or motivation to pull them thru no stakes were raised cause due to the script all that becomes meaningless when everything was quickly rebuild after the battled endedno repercussions  no challenge no moment of doubt cause guess what everyone is either too stupid to scared to much of an ahole to not want to challenge themyou can argue that bill murray was the walter peck of this universe but by killing him off forjoke sake that eliminated any challenge or any moment of question for the female team which makes them saving new yorkkinda useless cause theres really nothing to prove and also the bad guy in a portal after shooting him in the balls reallyno symbolism there i guess being sarcastic     midtown manhattan was partially destroyed then was quickly rebuild causeplot sake   and dont get me started with a female slimer jumping the shark for a spinoff much  as far is the special fx once again first half was pretty damn good and towards the end feels like scoobydoo monsters unleashed    and if i told you that they build these weapons to at least contain a ghost but instantly go back on that and somehow vaporize ghosts also you tell a person you cant kiss the containment pack due to radiation but then lick the guns on the third act causeits badass contradicts what you write in the story which makes some of the plot nonsensicle and maybe in the extended cut we will see a memorial service for holtzmann who passed away from licking at least 50000 grams of radiation in her system     also the villain is very forgettable and as much as i like rowan cause hes an original character created for this movie and probably one of the smart people in there but you dont get any backstory hes not complexat allno moral reason why hes doing what hes doing except he was bullied and he wants the world to sufferthats iton top of that you really dont know much about any of the main characters except only whats given to you     and dont get me started on product placement and cameos  sony does this alot in there movies the smurfs the amazing spiderman 1 and 2 etc where sony places everything out the rainbow on their movies and its pretty annoying if you ask mepapa johns isnt out of this either its just a bit jarring when you constantly see sony everywhere    and once again for a movie to stand on its on legs and get some places it relies very much on nostalgia cause you knowpeople love that   in the force awakens it was done very subtle and at times it was hard to pick it up until you watch it again nope not in ghostbusters answer the call where it literally slaps you in the face with it for the sake of  getting people in seats i guess    the overall    i love movies like the next person i grew up on this movie just like any other fan and read the idw comic books which are license canon of the original movies so when it left the theaters i had to ask myself these questions     did this movie rape my childhoodhell no     did the allfemale cast work yeah i think they didlike the chemistry     was the plotstory good no it was very basic at best     how was the editing way off at times it felt like they wanted to add more to the movie and cut stuff outincluding the dance routine     was this movie any good eh it made me chuckle at some moments the first half was showing some good promise but the 2nd and 3rd half went completely a different way paul and kate really hates  men and it shows i loved the technology and weapons in this film as well as the chemistry between the ladies which shined     was this movie catered for me good question no if a person never saw the 1984 ghostbusters and came into this movie with fresh eyes im sure they would love this movie if a person was a fan of the 1984 version and came into this movie they might get some fun from it but overall it will be either forgettable or memorable depending on the person and situation      all in all this movie is not badbut its not good either its just in the middle for me i watched this movieand afterwards went back home and watched the 1984 cause for me in my eyes thats the definitive movie    while it has some funnychuckle moments the story and plot just pulled it down along with the controversy as well as paul feigs input into the movie it feels like hes giving a middle finger to men as well as people who didnt like the idea of this rebootrather than making this film a fun adventure comedy that it supposed to be they turned it into paul feigs soapbox and thats not a way to do things especially for a movie that shouldnt have been treated that way should have just been fun ride     at best this could have been a spin off to the 1984 classic 30 yrs later and use these ladies as like plan b when the original ghostbusters disappeared to limbo or something have them as ghostbusters of boston or chicagobut this is what we got instead     fyi if you loved this film and thought it was greatthats awesome im glad you did and there are moments where i can see whybut as a wholei cant honestly say this wasnt what i was expecting    and now that ive seen this movie gave my two cents my morbid curiosity has come to passif a extended version of this movie comes out on blu ray i wouldnt mind watching it cause this movie was missing some scenes due to editing and pacing issues now im looking forward to at least better films like star trek beyond jason bourne lights out  andor suicide squad
Jul 16 2016,negative,the movie was terrible absolute junk  we left before it was over  thankfully we had free passes for this abomination or id have been really ticked off  we tried to keep an open mind on this one but the ladies were just not that funny  doesnt hold a candle to the original
Jul 16 2016,positive,thoroughly enjoyable for the whole family those ladies are hilarious  they definitely did not disappoint and gave us a fresh new take on the series
Jul 16 2016,positive,amazing the best cast you could ask for so hilarious saw it twice in less than 24 hours the girls just make you so happy and you fall in love with each one and their characters such good representation for little girls you can do anything you put your mind to honey 
Jul 16 2016,positive,loved thisit was a fun romp through a classic i and my entire family enjoyed
Jul 16 2016,positive,loved this movie it was a hell of a lot of fun and i will probably pay to see it again the cast is fantastic i was laughing the whole way through and i loved the callbacks to the original movie by far id say this is the secondbest ghostbusters movie there is a worthy addition to the franchise
Jul 16 2016,positive,i thought the film was great usually remakes are complete garbage but they did a great job with this movie  i have always been a fan of movies and especially growing up watching movies like ghostbusters i have nothing bad to say about the film because i can appreciate what it takes for films to be made you people who come on here bashing movies and thinking youre some sort of relevant critic should be ashamed of yourselves
Jul 16 2016,positive,paul feig is my favorite movie director i like acting of melissa and kristen
Jul 16 2016,negative,trying way to hard to be something it is not loved the original ghost buster this just adds a lot of effects but unimpressive
Jul 16 2016,negative,decided to put my money where my mouth is and give it the reboot a shot now i wish i went to see tarzan or now you see me 2 instead
Jul 16 2016,positive,you people saying that was one star are crazy i love the original i was a teen in the 80s and this was hilarious i especially love holtzman straight up believed she is a crazy ass engineer she was awesome and hemsworth yes thank you he was hilarious too go see it laugh and be merry there are too many things in the world to get stuck up your butt
Jul 16 2016,positive,didnt have high hopes for it but it turned out very good
Jul 16 2016,positive,i loved this movie it gets a lot of hate for being an all women cast but i was laughing constantly and it was hilarious the writers ties in references to the original movie perfectly and the actionfighting sequences were out of this world people dont give it a chance especially men and everyone should because it was amazing
Jul 16 2016,negative,lets take the leading comedic women of our time yes and give them a shitty script no undermining cameoswtf no with some standard special effects noooooooo that was a trap a giant shit trap its a waste to see talent not used on a screen
Jul 16 2016,positive,dont believe the trailers this movie was funny it is worth seeing
Jul 16 2016,neutral,this movie was kind of funnyi laughed i chuckled yes melissa mccarthy is the same character again but overall this movie wont ruin your childhood memories it losses most of its flavor by the end of the movie and ends on a sour note overall this movie is harmless if you like these four woman you will like this movie
Jul 16 2016,positive,one or two scenes that could have been edited but overall hilarious was very skeptical but it more than surpassed my expectations i left with my face and stomach hurting from laughing they did a great job of paying homage to the old while also keeping it new and fresh   kate mckinnon was wonderful to the point where i wish there was a little more of her chris hemsworth was also brilliant   any movie that i leave happy and with a smile on my face gets two thumbs up from me and got an applause in my showing  also refreshing to see strong female leads without having to be in bikinis ala the force awakens hunger games etc it is a nice trend that has started definitely see you know if you like to be happyotherwise avoid    stay until end of credits if a ghostbusters series fan
Jul 16 2016,negative,this movie was garbage  not even the cameos did any justice i give it a 0 out of 5 starts
Jul 16 2016,negative,marginally funny same story line as original  hemsworths only redeeming quality is his face a waste of kristen wiggs talent melissa mccarthys same character from everything she has done  walked out 34 of the way through because honestly i just didnt care how it ended but if it was anything like the rest of the movie it ended exactly the same way as the original extremely disappointed with this movie just like the most recent star wars it took scenes from the previous film and we made them with new actors playing the same characters completely unoriginal and an imaginative
Jul 16 2016,negative,this movie lacked everything they completely destroyed the ghostbusters franchise with this no comedy or story behind this movie the acting was way over done and they tried so hard with the comedy they all they got out of me is a yawn worst money spent this year
Jul 16 2016,positive,i watched both of the old ghost busters film and to be honest i liked the new one alot i enjoyed every second watching the movie and the jokes were very funny the acting was on point and the graphics were awesome i loved to see women as a heroic character i didnt see any antimale thingy in it i really think that those who are nagging about are just butt hurt sexists who can only accept a man to be the super hero i mean how many times were a woman portrayed as the dumb one in movies im sorry but kevin the male character did great and this was totally not sexist or antimale i mean there are a lot dumb guys who are a bit dumb am i right  recommendation stay until the very end of the credits and dont listen to what all these close minded people have said these people made up their minds before they even saw the movie have an open mind and enjoy yourself and you will see the movie for how it really is great
Jul 16 2016,negative,unbelievably awful what a total waste of talent time and money not funny at all
Jul 16 2016,negative,this movie was a mentally slow clap of a snl ghostbusters parody     and if you want a good female lead movies underworld aliens resident evil just 1 and 2 though terminator and the hunger games oh and the newest star wars speaking of which anyone else excited about rouge one    infact just go to this link and yes there are multiples and it has a list of lead actors or actoress that are better than this cast in a scifi series     
Jul 16 2016,negative,bad bad bad  this is a horrible movie and im generally the guy that keeps an open mind  for low tomatometer movies  bad acting poor plot and just plain stupid  i had to purchase the original as penance for my sins  do not ruin your childhood by seeing this stupid dumb movie rotten tomato  critics must have been paid off to write such a fresh review  omg sooo bad  its like i was forced to devour sour milk a raw horse heart and a bunch of  unripened persimmons shoved down my throat watching this pos  i would rather perform fellatio on a donkey than see this movie again  why did they do this ahhhhhhhh
Jul 16 2016,positive,i went last night and the comedy between the woman was fantastic the effects brought the ghosts to life if go expecting a remake of ghostbusters then youll automatically be disappointed where i hated the original because of all the men this new ghostbusters has taken my imagination and run with it i highly recommend this film
Jul 16 2016,positive,not as good as the original but pretty good
Jul 16 2016,negative,it sucked obviously the critics were trying to convince you it didnt due to a politically correct agenda call it for what it is trash
Jul 16 2016,positive,i love ghostbusters and this is ghostbusters go watch it in imax
Jul 16 2016,positive,hilarious and action packed  my entire family loved it  not your typical bad remake  so much fun
Jul 16 2016,positive,i was skeptic just like everyone else but i kept an opened mind and loved every minute i also have a 6 year old son that takes his geek culture as serious as his father and he absolutely loved it too i know some people are going to hate this film based off of their love for the originals but these new films deserve their fair shot and i honestly think they delivered
Jul 16 2016,positive,this rebootretelling of the 1984 original film is rather humorous and very enjoyable i walked in the theater having mixed ideas on what to think about this film but once i actually saw it i left the theater really enjoying it yes its not as good as the original film most the time a reboot isnt but its still a good take on the ghostbusters and the world built around them the cast of melissa mccarthy kristen wiig leslie jones and kate mckinnon was absolutely brilliant the four women just worked really well together i will say there wasnt too much character development between the four but for the most part you understood what type of person they were story wise its pretty close to the 1984 plot just tweaked a little and with women this time the visual effects for this film were decent there were a few times that the visuals looked a little off from the rest but for the most part the visuals displayed what they needed to for us to get it so would i recommend seeing this film i would say at least see it once and get your opinion i mean again i went in not being sure that it would be good and i came out loving it yes it has flaws with pacing a few out there visual effects and no character development but that aside this is a really enjoyable film
Jul 16 2016,positive,is it as good as the original no but lets face it not even its own sequel  or cartoon shows or even the video game was as good as the original that being said i really liked this it was funny and entertaining the visual fx were great i really liked  the fact that they didnt rehash the original story these are new characters with their own story featuring a great homage to the original i loved all the cameos in it too if you can forget about the original for one second i think youll enjoy this is it as good as the original again no but its better than ghostbusters ll
Jul 16 2016,negative,nothing works in this thing wish i had saved thirty bucks
Jul 16 2016,positive,loved it did not stop laughing the entire movie
Jul 16 2016,positive,i was pleasantly surprised after hearing early rumors it wasnt very good i was hesitant     the movie is well paced and the actors seemed to have great chemistry there were plenty of cameos and very well done the action was on point it did a fantastic job of making it its own movie one of the best examples of a successful reboot
Jul 16 2016,negative,it was essentially bridesmaids with proton packs  total waste of of these amazing actors true comedic talents  watched the first two ghostbusters films last night and this film fell grossly short of even the modest expectations i had poorly written and it was essentially bridesmaids with proton packs  total waste of of these amazing actors true comedic talents  watched the first two ghostbusters films last night and this film fell grossly short of even the modest expectations i had poorly written and incoherent   a remakereboot without zool no gozer  no gatekeeper  no peter wickthe villain literally looked like the nephew of janosz ghostbusters ii and a meeker dumbed down version at that  even chris hemsworth fans will be disappointed that he didnt take his shirt off 
Jul 16 2016,positive,super fun movie its not winning any oscars but it was very enterprising the ladies were super funny the story and ending were ok but the movie was carried but the comedy and fun tributes to the original
Jul 16 2016,negative,awful jokes were trying too hard the whole way through characters were all over the place all i saw was special effects and product placement cash cow of a franchise the theme song at the end im not afraid was a slap in the face to any fan as well   rotton
Jul 16 2016,positive,loved it the cast had great timing  together it was quirky fun and much better than i thought based on some of the early reviews  i went in hoping that it was not going to be exact copy of the original ghostbusters movie and i wasnt   disappointed the ghosts are cool and the cameos are awesome and funny
Jul 16 2016,positive,loved it i laughed so hard really refreshing new faces and new fun people have to go see this movie
Jul 16 2016,negative,this is easily one of the absolute worse movies ever made it puts the s in sucks a skid mark in the under pants of an otherwise great franchise
Jul 16 2016,positive,i was not originally going to see this movie but im glad i did     i was inspired to go after i saw leslie jones interview on the view and i decided to go support her    this movie is absolutely not a train wreck or terrible or anything like it was made out to be it was a lot of fun im thinking of going back to see it again     the science is kept grounded in as much reality as possible the accuracy of paranormal terms is maintained  dan aykroyd consulted and the effects are practical    its basically an origin story and its a fun one stay til the very very end of the credits for an awesome scene     go see it trust me
Jul 16 2016,negative,wow comedy should be funny first of all mostly bored throughout this movie hate that the original cast had cameos and the references to the original films if that was the plan it should have been a continuation of the originals not a reboot felt like a bad snl skit that wouldnt end still have no idea who two of the actors are nor do i care to see them in anything else
Jul 16 2016,positive,i think it deserves a solid four stars it wasnt perfect sure and it wasnt as good as the original obvs but it was a blast from start to finish the force awakensoriginal star wars compared only slightly better than ghostbusters 2016original ghostbusters
Jul 16 2016,positive,honestly i didnt think i would like this movie i loved the originals and am usually not a fan of reboots however i couldnt stand behind the fact that so many were hating on this movie before the trailers were even out hell if you look at some of the dates of the negative reviews on this page a lot of them were before the movie was even released its hard to look at that and forget that this is an all female reboot so i decided i would bite the bullet and go see it so that i wouldnt be that asshole who chose to hate something i hadnt seen     heres the thing i loved it the cast were amazing and very funny you can tell these women are close in real life because when they are together they absolutely shine there were tons of nods to the originals including cameos and  i geeked out pretty much every time     did i want to see this movie no  will i see it again hell yes
Jul 16 2016,positive,well done worth seeing
Jul 16 2016,positive,awesome movie funny entertaining and utterly woth my time i watched the original and this remake does a great job paying homage to it cameos of both the human and paranormal nature are in some instances heartwarming  ill be going again to watch it
Jul 16 2016,negative,i cant believe i saw this well its been so far the worst movie by paul feig bad ghostbusters movie bad everything at least the cgi is pretty top notch overall
Jul 16 2016,negative,great for little kids  terrible for anyone who saw the original  bad movie  dont waste the money to go see this  send a message to the studios that we demand more of movies if we are going to be charged 20 per person
Jul 16 2016,positive,funny rowdy girls with the spirit of the original  enjoyed the gags and then cameos by the original cast
Jul 16 2016,positive,laughed out loud through most of the movie the comedy was much in line with the original
Jul 16 2016,positive,i thought the snl cast members pulled off a very entertaining movie it was a good and funny film and i loved seeing these 4 funny snl women play leading roles in what is usually male dominated casts in action roles movies i especially liked kristen and melissa but jones and mckinnon were great as well i thought it was a great mix of pulling from the original as well as adding new material and great special effects and some pretty scary ghosts in the subway dont pay attention to many of the negative reviews they are probably people who think that any action movie must have males as leading roles the small cameo roles by murray and aykroyd and weaver were a nice touch go see this movie if you liked the first two ghostbusters you will not be disappointed
Jul 16 2016,positive,it was amazing  and it wasnt just a stereotypical reboot with the same dialogue and plot points yet it was completely nostalgic in its delivery  chris hemsworth stole the show  i saw it in 3d and there were points were my daughter was jumping out of her seat  my sons loved the action and the comedy  if you are not interested in laughing or having a good time dont see the show and if you are one of those people who sit around over analyzing every detail of a movie simply because is not what you would have done or because it isnt like the first one than again this movie isnt for you  but if you are a ghostbusters fan go ahead and laugh your head off also wait to the end of the credits for another nostalgic treat
Jul 16 2016,negative,this movie was not worth paying to see in theaters the writing was by far the worst part about the show there was no chemistry between the characters and the jokes werent funny if you think this movie will even come close to the original youre sadly mistaken
Jul 16 2016,positive,i didnt expect much and maybe that is why i enjoyed it
Jul 16 2016,positive,im a diehard fan of the original ghostbusters ive seen it countless times and it remains one of my alltime favourite comedies having said that i find the sequel lifeless and forgettable superfluous even i am absolutely not indiscriminate    and yet i liked paul feigs ghostbusters    i really liked it    yes the trailers were lame whoever cut them made me want to not see the movie they really did not do the movie justice in fact most not all of the gags that fell flat in the trailer worked in their proper context even some of the reheated ones    the cast was pretty good and they had an excellent dynamic i was most pleasantly surprised by melissa mccarthy who isnt all shouty for once think ray without the naiveté and kate mckinnon who plays a smart creative quirky and bad chick    yes there are plenty of small bits that i could have done without including the gimmicky arsenal the product placement some of the cameos an overthetop actionheavy finale as well as hemsworths part in it amongst other things    but i had a really good time and seriously i would see more of feigs ghostbusters if they made more i would love to see where they take it from here how the characters evolve and how they develop the concept yes i will see this one again    id give it a 775 out of 10 not quite an 8 but certainly better than average
Jul 16 2016,negative,not as bad as i thought it would be but it could have been much better  there were some laugh out loud moments but not enough  the original was better
Jul 16 2016,positive,to quote cyndi lauper oh mother dear were not the fortunate ones but girls just wanna have fun and boy did i ever have fun   theres a lot of white male tears flowing over this movie being a comedy for women only there was simply a single joke aimed towards the female audience the jokes were fair game for laughs across the board and laughs were had by all patty was one of the most relatable characters and in the end the smartest of them all news flash boys you cant be sexist towards men it doesnt work that way im so glad youre all so upset about kevin dumb as a rock but so pretty to look at did you not realize that those are roles women have gotten throughout history chris hemsworth isnt even my type but he can get it because hes not a cry baby like the lot of you threaten by your masculinity by a movie of ladies  above all this isnt a movie about feminist ruining your childhood you ruined it yourself all of the original ghostbusters were backing this movie with full support so whats your issue this isnt a movie about being a woman this isnt a movie about feminism this is a comedy about friendship ghosts and beliving in yourself the cast just happened to be women but it would be a fun film regardless of the gender of the cast if you liked this movie like i did i urge everyone to see it again   i aint afraid of no sexist nerd boys
Jul 16 2016,negative,not a great film but it doesnt deserve the hate that it is getting the cast works well enough and i enjoy the use of the theme tune but it falls short from the original ghostbusters as a reboot it disrespects and almost seems to try and erase the first ghostbusters film with the pointless cameos especially one specific character the scientist the sexualisation of chris hemsworths character is overblown completely almost every character plays on his looks and masculinity no gender was sexualised in any way in the original two films the male team werent good looking muscular men and the women werent revealing in way so it asks the question was this the rightsuitable franchise for the job this could have been a great film but it felt cheesy and some parts felt very out of place
Jul 16 2016,negative,paul feig posts a mediocre directorial effort once again poor cgi effects pound down on a somewhat beleaguered looking cast awash with talent given the pedigree an exercise in wasted potential
Jul 16 2016,positive,great reboot of ghostbusters kate mckinnon is fantastic as are wiig and mccarthy and jones hemsworth is a surprise as a comic foil very funny with lots of ties to the original
Jul 16 2016,neutral,it was mediocre  like a 500 yankees team  everything looked right and familiar it wasnt a dumpster fire but its clearly not on a par with the greatness that came before
Jul 16 2016,positive,i dont know which movie everybody else saw because this movie is most definitely welcome into the ghostbusters series first off it is super funny if somebody wants to say they didnt laugh once throughout the entire movie thats a total lie i dont like watching comedies because they rarely make me laugh but the delivery on 910 jokes were fantastic and i found myself and the audience laughing really hard the biggest joke is from the audience critiques all of this bs about feminism and hate mongering towards men not once during the film did my girlfriend or i think that paul feig was out to make men look terrible the most likeable character in the movie is a man chris hemsworth i too thought having women ghostbusters could be silly but i gave it a shot and the new cast earned their title if none of this sparks your interest remember that the original ghostbusters cast said they loved and cheered for the movie did i mention dan akroyd is the executive producer as well give this move a spin because it doesnt deserve any of the hate that its getting
Jul 16 2016,positive,i have to say i went into this movie not sure of what to expect i have never seen the original so i went in as a completely new fan and i have to say that i really enjoyed it our whole cinema was laughing really loudly the whole way through the movie and everyone was saying how much they enjoyed it when it ended along with taking out their phones to catch any pokemon they might have missed during the movie     im not sure where people are getting the idea what it is a man hating film i didnt get that at all  yes the villain was a man but so are they usually in half the movies we watch regardless i really enjoyed it and am definitely going to buy it when it comes out on dvd      i have to say i went into this movie not sure of what to expect i have never seen the original so i went in as a completely new fan and i have to say that i really enjoyed it our whole cinema was laughing really loudly the whole way through the movie and everyone was saying how much they enjoyed it when it ended along with taking out their phones to catch any pokemon they might have missed during the movie     im not sure where people are getting the idea what it is a man hating film i didnt get that at all  yes the villain was a man but so are they usually in half the movies we watch regardless i really enjoyed it and am definitely going to buy it when it comes out on dvd
Jul 16 2016,positive,witty refreshing and kate mckinnon shines
Jul 16 2016,negative,truly awful the ghostbusters were typecast as talkative women who are so into talking that they interrupt each other constantly id say the script is secretly misogynistic in this respect its not that the girls are unfunny its that the dialog is not fluent and the jokes are flat the script mostly sucks    go see lights out
Jul 16 2016,negative,the people giving this monstrosity a positive review probably fall into the same demographic that thoroughly enjoyed here comes honey boo boo freddie got fingered son of the mask you know products of the cesspool that is the underbelly of hollywood writing catering to the lowest possible denominator to remake such a beloved iconic culturally significant film and give it this treatment is a crime and a blatant demonstration of corporate nostalgiabait cash grabbing  choppy a lot of the time cringe inducing cheesiness all the time things happen just to happen and are not explained or have no consequence how can you not know the phone ringing is the one right next to you not the one in the fish tank kevin how is this funny an opportunity to make something truly magical and great turned into a rancid cringefest a bedsore sticking out in the filmography of all involved
Jul 16 2016,positive,great movie  not as good as the first but completely different and great in its own way
Jul 16 2016,positive,had big shoes to fill and its not gb1 but its better than gb2 and is good enough as a film in its own right cast work well together i dont see where all these stupid comments of man bashing come from there wasnt good cgi and many funny bits good cameos and setting it up for a sequel to take it in a new direction
Jul 16 2016,positive,despite all the crap people where talking about it before it was released its actually a pretty good movie
Jul 16 2016,positive,went to see ghostbusters 2016 it was a wonderful fun movie that does not disrespect the original  second while still having bits  memories including 5 of the actors from the first ones do not think this is just ghostbusters except with chicks it is solidly its own movie  well worth watching
Jul 16 2016,negative,terrible bad writing just a cash grab for ghostbusters fans
Jul 16 2016,positive,fun visually gorgeous smart  60 of the time fresh indeed not utterly groundbreaking  i wish leslie jones and melissa mccarthy swaped roles it would make a lot more sense
Jul 16 2016,positive,what a perfect summer movie fast paced really funny legit jump scares would definitely tell my friends to see it
Jul 16 2016,positive,honestly  this movie is seriously funny  kate mckinnon enough said  loved the nods of respect for ghostbusters 1984
Jul 16 2016,positive,a great movie with a fantastic cast a truly worthy update of a comedy classic that still manages to have its own identity
Jul 16 2016,negative,this movie was horrible one of the worst movies i have seen in the last 30 years mccarthy is dull as usual she thinks being fat is funny it was back in 1930 but this is 2016 you need talent devouring food is not a talent
Jul 16 2016,positive,highly entertaining and fun a couple of odd edit cuts and a slight lull 23 of the way through only reason it wasnt 5 stars
Jul 16 2016,negative,wowrespect the audience score here people  you got a bunch of critics afraid of being called sexist so giving it a falsely inflated rating  horrible movie  critics usually dont know what the heck they are talking about  i almost always go by audience score
Jul 16 2016,negative,worst movie of all time
Jul 16 2016,negative,if you enjoy fartqueef jokes this movie is for you if you have small children this movie is for you  if yourre a ghostbusters fan this movie is not for you save your time and money    leslie jones was the best ghostbuster because she was grounded and added knowledge to the history of the ghosts the rest were just a disrespectful caricature of the ghostbusters    again save yourself from this movie
Jul 16 2016,positive,pretty good movie  not meant to replace the original but certainly respects its spirit  some plot holes and it drags in a couple of places but overall a very enjoyable horroradventure movie
Jul 16 2016,negative,if they would take 0 stars as a rating i would give that but as it is i have to give it 05 stars  their humor does not appeal to me
Jul 16 2016,positive,i went in with an open mind and prepared to have fun if it was there to have  and it was  laughed a lot dance to the ghostbusters theme in our chairs spotted cameos and had a really good time  i give it 5 stars bc i believe it was intended to be a good time movie and that it was
Jul 16 2016,negative,god what a waste of my money the plot is terrible  the jokes were unfunny and the special effects were mediocre and what was up with all of the man hating i am all about womens rights but we dont need to hate men for it this movie was made to pander to third wave feminists and to push leftist views on the populace im really wondering if sony bought out several of these online reviews  i know they had been deleting negative comments on youtube for this movie what a disgrace
Jul 16 2016,positive,its delightfully entertaining a refreshing reboot the lady ghostbusters were the best part of the filmfunny smart and asskicking
Jul 16 2016,negative,im shocked people on here are saying they like it  are they real people  i dont think those reviews are legit i just have to say something about this bs i should have been a fish in a barrel because i was psyched to see it and i like most things i see  but it just sucked seriously this film was an abortion  it wasnt funny interesting or well written whoever wrote it should be embarrassed he hasnt managed to create 3d characters for a multimillion dollar movie   i dont care that it wasnt funny but i was annoyed at how shit the cgi was stupid and the characters were stupid and chris hemsworth was really really stupid  i am super annoyed but at least i didnt pay for my own ticket so its just my time i want back
Jul 16 2016,positive,this was a good and funny film
Jul 16 2016,positive,ignore the middle aged buster boys who cry when there casting choices are catered too its a rehash but its pretty funny
Jul 16 2016,neutral,if your giving this movie a good review  just because its a female leading movie then your just as dumb as the people giving it bad review because they hate its not the original cast the movie was alright but it wasnt what i expected
Jul 16 2016,positive,i didnt love it but i enjoyed it  i did wonder if it would be received better or worse if the film wasnt called ghostbusters or at least was written as a different generation of the original characters families  funny seeing the mighty thor be so goofy and    actually dance on occasion  all in all not worthy of the antipathy from the fanboys but an enjoyable if sorta scooby dooish scifi flick with some funny ladies doing what they do
Jul 16 2016,negative,true story  my son turned to me about 1 hours 5 minutes in and asked who the bad guys in the movie were  the ghosts or the men i was taken aback by the question but it made sense  there is straightup manbashing throughout this movie and its fairly disturbing  is there some culture war going on between hollywood and middle aged men     movie was average nothing to get to excited or upset about  as for where all the feminist angst is coming from i have no idea
Jul 16 2016,positive,this ghostbusters remake is so much better than what everyone is saying the cast is great the humor is spot on and the movie is just overall really entertaining
Jul 16 2016,negative,not good at all special effects are great but the rest seems to be not a good fit
Jul 16 2016,positive,not perfect but great start  i really hope they make more
Jul 16 2016,positive,ghostbusters far exceeded my expectations i am a huge lifetime fan of the original and so i was admittedly a bit nervous going to see the 2016 version but my fears were quickly put to rest i had a big goofy grin on my face from start to finish     its two parts clever comedy and one part action with a dash of horror and its got a style of its own the cast has great chemistry and a talent for comedy it was a treat watching ghostbusters with my wife and i will nodoubt see it again before it leaves theatres
Jul 16 2016,negative,this movie does not exist this is a parody of the ghostbusters films in the same line as the scary movie series
Jul 16 2016,negative,dont even bother  cheap rip off of the original terrible casting choices with no chemistry jokes felt forced and cgi looked cheap
Jul 16 2016,negative,what a colusal waste of time there were a couple of truly funny parts seperraed by blah blah blah blah blah it just want that good i am sure kids will love it but if you saw the original youd be better off stay i have home and watching that one on dad or netflix sorry i wasted the last of my vip passses on this stinker
Jul 16 2016,neutral,the latest ghostbusters screams girl power but it comes off as a mixed bag of colorful visual effects hitandmiss humor and surprise cameos from the original cast the film is basically the first movie repainted and it falls short on creativity
Jul 16 2016,positive,hilarious such a fun movie
Jul 16 2016,negative,i shouldve been prepared for the disappointment when i asked the usher if there were any pokemon inside the theater before going in and he said no  i really wanted this to be good and it really was not  thor was pretty funny but all the cameos from the original film were wasted more than any other cameos in history of film  i think this couldve been a good film if it simply was set in the original ghostbusters universe  this was supposed to be a comedy but the theater was quieter than during schindlers list  who you gonna recommend  not this
Jul 16 2016,negative,new ghostbusters is about as good as the 3rd home alone has the same name as the earlier films tries too hard to be funny uses pretty much the same story but with different characters and although is not a complete trainwreck from start to finish it is overall unsatisfying and ill probably never watch it again even the original cast who did cameos didnt look like they wanted to be there added a bonus star due to the creative use of 3d which is by far the best part of this movie
Jul 16 2016,positive,fantastic film that really understands its not about the jokes but the delivery still holds the small budget charm with a few good laughs it was never going to be amazing but considering what it was up against theyve done really well
Jul 16 2016,positive,was a perfect mix of action and comedy nods to the original were a great note but these ladies and the story stood out on there own
Jul 16 2016,positive,really entertaining moves at a good clip really funny at times including chris hemsworths performance who knew and holy crud is kate mckinnon outstanding in this  the cg ghosts are also pretty impressive
Jul 16 2016,positive,i loved it even more than the original  i went in there with no prejudice or expectations and was very impressed it was funny had a great cast and some of the ghost actually freaked me out plus  i loved their new toys give this movie a chance it definitely deserves it
Jul 16 2016,positive,this is the funniest movie ive seen in several years i think id rate it higher if i could the theatre was emptier than it should have been when i saw it opening night probably due to poor reviews it got from viewers before it was even released but everyone there was laughing the whole time i strongly recommend it
Jul 16 2016,negative,most jokes fall flat movie isnt awful just tries to hard jones is the only saving grace mckinnon is suppose to be over the top i guess but doesnt work well at times everybody else just shows up for the pay checks dont even get me started on helmsworth
Jul 16 2016,negative,went to it with an open mind but it really is horrible  this film should never have been remade with women or men  the original was greathollywood has just run out of ideas
Jul 16 2016,positive,good summer fun i dont see why the hate and backlash everyone did a great job
Jul 16 2016,positive,far far better than the trailer led me to believe it was going to be
Jul 16 2016,positive,mckinnon steals the show but the chemistry is palpable the jokes are fresh and its the perfect mix of the original storyline and new characters an excellent summer flick
Jul 16 2016,positive,its not the ghostbusters i would have asked for but it was a delight
Jul 16 2016,negative,this movie was really really stupid none of the jokes landed and it seemed as if the actresses had just met for the first time yuck
Jul 16 2016,negative,hollywood and vancouver need to end this addiction to reboots eg the quick buck and infuse themselves with actual creativity again
Jul 16 2016,negative,typical hollywood take a great movie make it pc by changing it from a male lead that was successful to a female lead that is horrible and poof the new hollywood agenda is born too bad most people saw this as a crap movie regardless of who was leading maybe hollywood can make the dirty dozen an all female movie and see how it does or maybe fried green tomatoes as an all male cast wheehew what a blast those would be idiots
Jul 16 2016,negative,this is a rather disappointing movie the jokes are not funny and borderline awkward they tried to make hemsworths character stupidfunny but just got stupidstupid
Jul 16 2016,positive,i really enjoyed this movie holtzman had me laughing pretty hard and kevin had me in tears i was laughing so hard    do yourself a favor and get the troll reviews out of the way and just watch this very entertaining movie
Jul 16 2016,positive,fun summer movie the effects on 3d were impressive it felt like the 80s all over again
Jul 16 2016,positive,not as good as the original but still a must see film hopefully the do a sequel they could fix some of the problems and maybe make a better trailer lol
Jul 16 2016,negative,horrible to watch i would have left halfway through if i didnt come with others  no original thought came from the making of this film  lets just throw the the original cast in throughout the movie in hopes that people might like it while watching a complete lackluster and unoriginal film  even the villain was horrible
Jul 16 2016,positive,i dont know what all the negative reviews are about the essence of a ghostbusters movie is combining humor with science fiction and i thought this movie did just fine although i will admit that the premise of destroying ghosts as opposed to containing them is what prompted me to give the movie just 4 stars i grew up with ghostbusters and i am a huge fan this movie is a plain good old fashioned fun to watch popcorn and soda sort of movie ive learned my lesson by not trusting reviews that are too negative especially from people who cant even get their grammar diction and spelling straight go watch it for yourself and see if you like it also writing reviews shouldnt be about bashing because just like all of us the people who made this movie had to work and earn a living how would you like it if i told you the quality of your work sucks and you should probably get a real job
Jul 16 2016,positive,seeing powerful funny roles for women where they are not sex objects was amazing more please
Jul 16 2016,negative,to put it simply as a man i actually felt unwanted at this movie which is something i have not felt since thelma and louise  had the movie been funny or entertaining i would have easily overlooked this pcdriven feminist agenda  sadly it was an extremely formulaic somewhat average summer movie      although i cant believe im actually writing this i think this movie deserves to fail  it was made for all the wrong reasons  to be fair it had a few laughs and wasnt any better or worse than ghostbusters ii  i just cant get past all this other crap that ruins the movie
Jul 16 2016,negative,it was kind of funny the movie had cameos of some of the original cast but overall not a good movie
Jul 16 2016,positive,this movie is funny the theater was packed with people who were laughing in the places they were supposed to while its not perfect it leaves you hopeful that movies in general will transcend to this movies level of awesome and then go beyond it i did not grow up with the original ghostbusters but have watched it several times as an adult this version equals if not surpasses the original the trailer wasnt good but the film is top notch i plan to see it a few more times while its in theaters and will buy it when it comes out its a welldone remake
Jul 16 2016,positive,funny smart love the female cast and the cameos by the original cast     lots of special fx and less ghost fighting than ghost catching but still a lot of fun especially kate mckinnon     maybe not as lasting as the original but definitely a great popcorn film for the whole family
Jul 16 2016,negative,pathetic insult to the original being an 80s baby i hated this with a passion just as much as hated the star wars garbage remake i sincerely feel bad for the kids growing up now theyre standard of excellence is built on crap and more crap i walked out 45 minutes in throw it on the garbage and light it on fire i demanded a refund from the theatre
Jul 16 2016,positive,what a ripper saw ghostbusters last night honestly i was laughing out loud it was that good the characterisations are great dialogue is hilarious and there is so many tongue in cheek references to the sexist era of the 1980s and the original film the women are the heroes and chris hemsworth is the good looking secretary whos hopeless at his job he embraces the role and shines at its base it is a send up and takes the piss out of the original film and the genre at the same time its also entertaining in its own right due to being well structured having a great cast and plenty of special effects the plot is deliberately far fetched but presented as reasonable which adds to its side splitting humour there are appearances by bill murray annie potts and sigourney weaver in fact there is a scene during the credits between mckinnon and weaver that is one of the best in the film dan aykroyd is executive producer there are a couple of moments when it doesnt work and a there are a few lines that would have been best left out  but they are small and i was too busy laughing to worry them also the film might piss a few people off if especially if they dont get the context of the film anyway i cant wait for the sequel i say thanks for the best laugh ive had all bloody year go girls
Jul 16 2016,positive,i was blown away by this movie i laughed until i cried i enjoyed the cheesy ghosts and i fell in love with the chemistry of the cast i understand why some people cant relate to four female leads but this is their great loss i have never wanted to immediately watch a movie again after seeing it but i wanted an immediate encore of this movie a hilarious fun over the top summer fun movie  magnificent
Jul 16 2016,positive,really doesnt deserve the hate good movie
Jul 16 2016,neutral,i give it a hearty meh chris hemsworth and the special effects were the definite highlights not much else good i can say
Jul 16 2016,negative,incredibly stupid jokes werent funny it is an embarrassment compared to the original ghostbusters movie
Jul 16 2016,positive,as a stand alone movie this movie is great as a movie that is based son a beloved comedy it does a very capable job at honoring the original while being unique and telling a different story than the original source material the cast delivers great performances with some very nice stand out moments for each very much a worth while movie to see
Jul 16 2016,negative,why did this movie hate men so much
Jul 16 2016,positive,funnier spookier bechdel test passing and how and more badass than the original which i grew up with a loved my only real complaint is that there were too many cameos and homages to the original they were unnecessary this movie stands on its own and it so much fun i cant wait to watch it again
Jul 16 2016,negative,the only thing this movie made me want to do was watch the original the old cast cameos were cool and it had some interesting ideas but holy hell the movie as a whole was garbage is it funny now a days to just be dumber than a box of rocks i honestly thought chris hemsworth character was mentally retarted the characters in the movie were so over the top abnormal i didnt care one bit about them did they really have to have the stereotypical loud black woman winston was normal and cool as crap ughregardless of it being ghostbustersim just tired of dumb comedy and unrelatable characters oh and lets not forget where they shoot the end boss to get him to let go of a building in the endsigh
Jul 16 2016,positive,were all tired of reboots and remakes this one gets its right if you can let it be its own thing in your mind its lots of fun
Jul 16 2016,positive,i went to see ghostbusters i got ghostbusters the city the tech the lore the world it gave me what i expected
Jul 16 2016,positive,saw it last night and it was very entertaining  great gags and it honored the original with cameos that worked in the story line
Jul 16 2016,negative,awkwardly paced poorly written jokes and over acted characters made this movie lean heavily on nostalgia to limp past the finish line weird editing and clunky comedy made us more than a handful of times look at eachother and shrug
Jul 16 2016,negative,horrible 2 hours of my life i will never get back the whole place seemed to breathe a sigh of relief when it was finally over thought this was supposed to be a comedy
Jul 16 2016,negative,it was okay     nothing special
Jul 16 2016,positive,i always thought the idea of a ghostbusters reboot told with female leads was an interesting idea now despite all the backlash and precriticism from die hard purists of the original i can say it worked out well this is an effective reboot filled with funny one liners to take home with you clean humor and extremely creative ghost design  a solid summer blockbuster
Jul 16 2016,positive,the entire family enjoyed this movie i havent laughed out loud so much at a movie in a long time i really dont get the bad reviews which has compelled me to write my first review ever i loved the original ghostbusters movies and this did not disappoint the entire theater cheered at the end so i know im not alone i will go back to the theater to see this again
Jul 16 2016,positive,not a classic but not deserving the vitriol its received  the cast had fun making it it adds some original ideas to the source material and it has enough strengths to claim its place in our culture  it was worth the ticket and i would watch a sequel    i aint afraid of no mra
Jul 16 2016,negative,a sad excuse for a ghostbusters film and thats including the sequel nods and shout outs to the original hardly make up for a film that lacked originality from the start a few laughs and moments of enjoyment do not make this reboot anymore palatable to fans of the original back off man im a scientist
Jul 16 2016,negative,utter crap as bad as the trailers promistd it would be    on a side note i am quickly losing faith in the reviews on rt which used to be a credible look at film quality a lot of these 5star glowing reviews link back to profiles that dont exist i saw the same thing in reviews of the horrendous everybody wants some after on opening night my brother and i were the only ones in the theater and the film was so bad for the first time in my life i got up and left the cinema early yet there are glowing reviews from people with no profiles that propped the movie into the 80s for a score i think rt either permits or is complicit in a review campaign for bad films     this one is a turd pile of manhating humor that never hits the mark and oddlycheesy cgi not worth your 13 if you really must see it wait for red box    and dont believe all these 5star one sentence reviews from fake profiles
Jul 16 2016,positive,dont listen to the donnie downers this was a very funny addition to the franchise so many subtle homages and great guest spots when we werent laughing out loud we were grinning from ear to ear
Jul 16 2016,positive,i wont spoil anything but as a ghostbusters super fan this movie did not ruin my childhood i had a good time watching it which is the point of going to the movies it was funny scary and kate mckinnons character of holtzmann was the absolute best fans of the original will enjoy this and a new generation of kids will be running around with proton packs trying to catch ghosts thanks for not effing up kevin feig the biggest downside to this movie bill murray
Jul 16 2016,negative,after watching this movie im suspicious that sony has paid top critics on this site to post good reviews about this movie to dissipate the storm of bad reviews this movie deserves i think they may have done the same with the google searches as the only reviews that appear on the front page are reviews that came out before the review embargo i think this is highly immoral and clandestine as this is an objectively awful movie in every regard and i would hate the public to waste their money
Jul 16 2016,positive,movie was entertaining funny a lot of action and pays homage to the original a must see you will not regret it
Jul 16 2016,negative,the effects are nice  the girls work as a team the major problem is that it tries to follow the original waaaaay to closely which sets it up to fail because nothing can compare to the pacing tone jokes  and even story of that movie
Jul 16 2016,positive,super funny great effects mckinnon steals the show
Jul 16 2016,negative,walked out of the movie and literally forgot what i just saw
Jul 16 2016,positive,loved the movie i was very wary of it because of all the bad press but if you can let go of the stigma it is a fun movie cant wait to own on blue ray
Jul 16 2016,negative,misses the point of ghostbusters
Jul 16 2016,positive,i thought it was great great humour great effects would definitely watch again loved the cameos from the originals too the kevin character could of been not as dumb thats why i gave it 45
Jul 16 2016,positive,the four leads have such a genuine hilarious chemistry together that the movies pacing problems seem entirely secondary riotously fun and wonderfully colorful ghostbusters is a flash of joy in a summer of dower glum and bluegrey tints
Jul 16 2016,positive,hilarious romp perfect casting great laughs dont believe the internet trolls
Jul 16 2016,positive,fresh and new while paying homage to the one with the boys
Jul 16 2016,negative,the movies doesnt seem to know what it wants to be its a bit messy and the cast are a bit touch and go
Jul 16 2016,negative,based on the trailer and the chemistry among these mediocre comedians i think ill pass and the opinion shaming by these industry idiots is perhaps another reason ya think
Jul 16 2016,negative,the kind of garbage top critics like
Jul 16 2016,positive,when i went in to see the movie i didnt have very high expectations for this movie but after i left i was very pleased with how this movie turned out they did a very good job making this film being a fan of the original ghostbusters i cant really say this is better but it definitely was very funny and enjoyable to watch i also like how they threw in some tributes to the old film as well
Jul 16 2016,neutral,better than i thought it would be it offers just enough laughs and pays homage to the original in just the right amount of way it still feels choppy at times and still a distant second to the original but better than the second one
Jul 16 2016,neutral,the movie does have a more indepth story than the original by having an actual villain with a plan rather than circumstance in the first movie but there are so many scenes that are wasted in this movie including 2 mins of a man flipping the bird the acting of the 4 women isnt bad w the exception of holtzman who mugs for the camera every chance she gets it seems while there are a lot of scenes that made me at the very least chuckle many more scenes are a waste and shouldve been cut from the film w even the most veteran of actors performing sub par the biggest insult this movie had to offer came in the way of cameos from original cast members but you can decide on that at the very least i do want to see more ghostcorps productions i just want more effort to be placed in the movies from here on out
Jul 16 2016,negative,movie had some giggles but is not as good as the original movies comedy the villain is dumb forgettable and  made no sense and thank you paul fieg and sony for making all men look stupid in this film and if you made it through the horrible credits you get a scene where they hint at a second movie    no one else see this film please
Jul 16 2016,positive,its okay but you have to it in 3d to really enjoy it
Jul 16 2016,negative,i was wondering what all the hype was about with feminists calling this movie an ode to feminism and saying that anyone who hated it are misogynists i now understand why so few people identify as feminist and why so many are against the movement this movie was an ode to hatred of men and it is obvious that its supporters were projecting their own sexism and chauvinism onto those who were speaking against this movie its not even worth the 12 star i gave it the manhating would have been bad enough but add to that the fact that it just wasnt funny at all ok there were a few chuckles early on but for the most part the theater was silent every man in the movie was either evil or idiotic and their motivations were not really explained at all it was very poor lazy writing that made it clear that the writers werent aiming to make a good movie they were just aiming to cash in on apparent feminist vitriol against men and boys    speaking of the writing was just horrible there was none of the wit that we saw with the original and many parts of the movie didnt even make any sense especially when it came to the special effects  its like the actors and writers never communicated with the cgi team and didnt know what was going to be on the screen for example after the possessing ghost  visibly leaves the ghostbuster right in front of your face why continue to hit her for the slapstick comedic effect it might have been funny if it made sense to do that but it came off as just stupid and speaking of the cgi there were parts that werent too bad mediocre even but the end when the antagonist turns onto the ghostbusters logo it looks like something out of a disney cartoon which looked really out of place and well lazy and of course they have to put the icing on the misandry cake by shooting the antagonist in the crotch with their proton beams    the worst part was what hey did to bill murray you can tell he didnt want to be there and they treated his character horribly it makes me wonder how they forced the actor to participate which leads me to wonder if the other actors from the original were there under duress as well this movie was so horribly disrespectful to the original movie as well as all of the fans of the original and to the audience as a whole i have a hard time believing that the actors of the original were happy with what was being done to the franchise its as infuriating as it is sad    as we were leaving the theater the looks on the faces of those around me were looks of bewilderment why would sony sign off on what amounted to a kick in the collective crotch of the audience do manhating feminists really have so much power in our society that they can now browbeat movie executives into cowtowing to their political agenda now i understand why there is a growing number of people who identify as antifeminist this movie and the way that sony and feminists have bullied anyone who spoke out against the movie and its trailers convinces me that antifeminist is not only a preferable label but one that is becoming increasingly necessary
Jul 16 2016,negative,where do i begin the only positive i could really find was that it was not as bad as i thought it would be at least hemsworth was passable but even his dialogue was often cringeworthy unfortunately most of the jokes were cringeworthy eg queef jokesreally and the petulance displayed by feig and co in descending to trying their best to insult critics of the film was something to behold and thats before we even consider the obvious and consistent misandry throughout this failure of a thing that masquerades as a ghostbusters film do not waste your money on this trash
Jul 16 2016,negative,boring mediocre had i seen this on television i would switch channel after the first ten minutes one of the worst movies ive seen in awhile
Jul 16 2016,negative,all of the characters lacked depth and none of the jokes were funny mckinnon was a highlight but not enough to keep the film afloat the one silver lining a soundtrack of entertaining remixes of the original theme
Jul 16 2016,positive,although it was very different from the original i really really enjoyed this movie i dont understand the terrible ratings that it is getting
Jul 16 2016,positive,funny amazing cast such an amazing film loved it
Jul 16 2016,positive,first seeing the trailers for this movie i couldnt help but be somewhat interested in a ghostbusters reboot it had kick ass female heroes what did somewhat put me off to the movie though  was the out cry from fans of the original movie and the back and forth debate on whether this movie would be any good and trust me it is     i went into the movie with an open mind if i was bad then so be it but if its good then thats great most of the beginning is devoted to setting up the characters and setting the plot in motion even as we hit the core of the film it didnt slow down didnt seem to bore you to death and the action seems were enjoyable the villain though kinda creepy in his own right is lackluster and could have used more characterization     moving onto the cast the star who stole the show was definitely kate mckinnon although the cast overall was wonderful the jokes were mostly funny although some were misses or didnt entirely make me laugh but it was still enjoyable that being said there were some minor problems with the film some scenes were dragged out too long and others were simply too fast then there was a little dance sequence which is very short maybe a minute maybe less and is only really seen during the credits but the film despite these things still holds up     all in all the movie is good its a nice summer film and is definitely worth seeing its amazing to see a female lead movie that is pretty good and represents women fairly well
Jul 16 2016,positive,great chemistry of scares gadgets and comedy
Jul 16 2016,positive,look at the score pfft the only time this site shows higher than imdb trying to be politically correct
Jul 16 2016,negative,a truly horrible movie experience made worse by the inevitable comparison to the original ghostbuster classic halfway through the movie my wife was checking her watch hoping t would end soon it seemed as though the driving force for the plot was to denigrate white males including the cameo performances by the remaining original ghostbuster characters the role of their male receptionist played by chris hemsworth was particularly painful to watch since his inability to figure out how to answer the phone bordered on making fun of the mentally disabled why the lone black female wasnt portrayed as a scientist like her three while female partners was mystifying and disturbing all of these hurdles might have been able to be overcome if the movie was even mildly entertaining but it was just boring and not funny to get over this experience im going to have to watch the original ghostbusters to remind myself that a movie doesnt have to be offensive to be entertaining
Jul 16 2016,positive,i loved it it was a refreshing addition to a good original premise totally worth seeing
Jul 16 2016,positive,kate mckinnon and the footage accompanying the end credits were fun movie also makes the most of the sound track and guest cameos
Jul 16 2016,positive,really great  i have no idea why people are hating on this film  its funny and does a great job paying homage to the original  loved it  dont listen to the naysayers go see it with an open mind and you will have fun
Jul 16 2016,negative,what a chunk of shit curiosity got the better of me and i want my money back
Jul 16 2016,positive,i saw the reboot of ghostbtiousters yesterday and here are my views    i was surprised in a very positive way after the bad press and truly awful trailers the movie itself did not only prove itself to be funny it was hilarious    comparisons with the original are unavoidable but frankly i think this new version comes amazing close to the quality of the first one it certainly outshines ghostbusters 2 although some may claim that this is not difficult to do    it is differently paced though jokes and action follow a much faster speed and intensity than the original one you can tell that the style of movies changes with the years and while the original ghostbusters was definitely a child of the 80s this one is most clearly the offspring of our own times less time is spent in this reboot on foreshadowing and mythology to explain the doom that is to befall the world also that doom approaches much more suddenly but that suddeness is mitigated by the constant barrage of hilarity that is delivered by the cast and boy do they deliver each character has its own distinct personality which amazingly enough also stand apart from the identity of the original ghostbusters while paying homage to them as well    as for the criticisms about the cast being all female and the only black character still being the only nonscientist when you watch the movie without expectations as if you had never heard of the original you may find that the all female characters bring a new dynamic and that the black character actually appears more grounded than the often airheaded scientists    i was surprised and delighted in how it turned out actually i want to see more of the new ghostbusters please pretty please
Jul 16 2016,positive,a must see  it was hilarious
Jul 16 2016,negative,how anyone likes this movie im not sure this is hollywood bastardising a franchise
Jul 16 2016,positive,starts out with some promise but falls into a weird parody of the originals the film never seems to find its own identity either while it throws so much incoherent weirdness at the audience that it hopes we find at least some of it funny the lone bright spot for me was chris hemsworth whose bumbling hunk idiot elicited the most laughs all while being an odly endearing character the rest of the film however mostly bored me i think that mostly stemmed from illdefined main characters and odd confusing edits along with pacing problems an unfortunate pass on this one
Jul 16 2016,negative,a pretty bad attempt to reboot series  jokes misfire in all directions  studio spending a lot of money to save this turkey  rip ghostbusters
Jul 16 2016,negative,if this were an original instead of a remake no one would be remaking it in 30 years the biggest problem is the same problem most blockbusters have these days theres nothing iconic about it no lines that will be repeated for years no characters that stand out no muchness going on a rental if youre curious to see it mckinnon and jones are bad but the cast doesnt really gel it feels like theyre all doing there own thing and then these separate acts are edited together hey but slimer is in it
Jul 16 2016,positive,i didnt have high hope for this movie but after watching it it wasnt that bad actually pretty good and doesnt deserves the hate its getting
Jul 16 2016,positive,i didnt expect it to be so good wellpaced consistently hilarious and visually spectacular without overdoing the action sequences this was everything a ghostbusters movie ought to be i only recognised one of the four leads but all were great fantastic film and worthy successor to the original
Jul 16 2016,positive,i got the opportunity to see this movie twice and i plan to see it again as a movie goer and a fan of the original ghostbuster films this movie in my personal opinion has captured the heart and spirit of what the original films were about its brought its own take on ghostbusters  franchise that respects and honors the original films for this generation and i personally look forward to seeing more in the future
Jul 16 2016,negative,its not bad its very bad skip it
Jul 16 2016,positive,full movie in hd free  safest ever   note for android only torrent client must be preinstalled
Jul 16 2016,positive,it was so much fun im not going to lie part of the reason im giving it five out of five is because i think a lot of people are not giving it a fair shot so im trying  to even everything out but even without that my rating would be really high i wasnt expecting much and wasnt a huge fan of the originali loved it its fun and lighthearted and go see it
Jul 16 2016,positive,hilarious homage to its predecessor with an career changing performance by kate mckinnon
Jul 16 2016,positive,i found it funny and entertaining after seeing it with the kids  they informed me we will be buying it so thats their take on it 
Jul 16 2016,negative,while i wasnt initially pleased with the gender swapout the film has its quirky moments and is a fun timekiller in its own right when it attempts to stand on its own 2 feet but only when it isnt trying so hard to make a statement of itself and the feminist quarter as well as become a political statement     the bill murray cameo too was unnecessary and slaps the original in the face     no fieg just no
Jul 16 2016,positive,it delivered what it was supposed toofun unabashedly so   do yourself a favor and go see it in imax 3d if you have the option they apparently shot it for that  i found myself laughing a lot throughout the movie and the cameos were nicely sprinkled    the effects breaking the 4th wall outside the film gate made the ghost stuff really pop off the screen in a cool wayagain this was tailored hard towards 3d  i am also not sure i have ever witnessed a more expensive set of credits laden with effects through its entirety
Jul 16 2016,negative,i wanted to like this movie so much but it felt like another hollywood cash grab using nostalgia porn i think this wouldve been a great movie with this cast if it wasnt bogged down w franchise building and the stench of reboot retcon this cast works well together and they are genuinely funny but this ip was not a right fit and the overall tone was just downright trash if you truly want to see it i recommend you avoid this movie until it makes its way to netflix
Jul 16 2016,negative,great cast  and has a few moments but how did such a poorly written screenplay get green lit by sony
Jul 16 2016,positive,a lot of fun and way better than i expected a great balance of jokes and fun moments
Jul 16 2016,negative,i really wanted to like this movie  ive been waiting for a new ghostbusters for what seems like forever and even after some bad trailers i still thought the talent would shine it didnt the story was boring cgi nothing special and the jokes just werent that funny it wants to be as good and emulate the original while also being different enough to standalone but those two conflicting ideas leave it in some strange and unentertaining middle ground    my daughters on the other hand absolutely loved it and my teenage son also liked it a bit more than me it felt like something i may have liked when i was a lot younger so if youre in the 1020 age group you might think it is very fun    i was hoping itd be good but it really disappointed in every way of you love ghostbusters or the cast its worth a watch but maybe wait until its on demand and save some money
Jul 16 2016,negative,what an awesome facepalm generator this was save your money buy something worthwhile i wish i did
Jul 16 2016,negative,i already wasted enough time watching this no need to give an in depth critique of all that was wrong its awful but your money you have been warned
Jul 16 2016,negative,take everything fun and refreshing from the original and this what you get
Jul 16 2016,negative,this movie not good
Jul 16 2016,negative,there were somewhat funny moments but they were really stupid and unoriginal to say the least    i did not like how they made the ghosts in this reboot they look so fake and cartoony and too colorful  so between the human ghosts some of them look like cartoons and some are real people which is it    then there was the actual last fight scenes i guess its a trend that every movie these days theyre like expert shooters and fighter where the hell did they learn how to move like that  the original was more believable showed them as amateurs going in and wasnt over the top  like fast and furious its entertaining thats for sure you have a gang of normal street racers and fast forward now theyre a professional international squad of whatever they are  get outta here everything is so fake and over the top    finally when i walked out of the theater i really asked myself what was the story about  its about a loner dude bringing ghosts back to destroy the world but the whole premise was so flat it was really sad  the original was about a woman being haunted they investigate turns out they stumbled onto a whole bigger scene  that provides some twist and turns making it bigger and builsing up to a great final    besides portraying all men as idiots or loners it becomes a bit insulting and the mayor and his team are  complete baffons with their whole role trying to surpress the ghostbusters while admitting its real in the back    they should never have rebooted the movie it should have been a continuation where the women are like the next generation and its like the ghostbusters kids and their friends taking the torch a better story could have been built around that and they ask their elders for some help in someway that would have been a better story    lastly why was there no mention of tobins spirit guide  i loved the mention of that from harold ramis
Jul 16 2016,positive,a lot of fun and i also felt that it was a nice reminder of the original a great intro to the next gen of ghostbusters
Jul 16 2016,positive,if you want to watch the original thats fine but this is actually a very funny stand alone movie dont let the purist fanboys of the original stop you from enjoying a solid comedy with strong female leads
Jul 16 2016,negative,absolutely not worth the money sad to say the folks who hated this movie were right
Jul 16 2016,positive,this movie was phenomenal a wonderful tribute to the original and also its own movie this movie had me and the whole theater laughing out loud there are some great jokes cameos and assorted surprises in this amazing summer flick
Jul 16 2016,neutral,didnt love it didnt hate it for every thing i liked came something i didnt kate mckinnon and chris hemsworth were the show stealers the effects and action was pretty cool and there were some gags that make me laugh a lot where the film began to falter was in the second act where it felt that the pacing slowed down a lot followed by some really awkward cameos from the original cast among other things that bothered me on a personal level i feel paul feig wasnt right for the directors chair as his style that fit his original material didnt fit ghostbusters very well in the end im not sure if i would have preferred a train wreck as this is a movie that simply exists and nothing else actually i would have preferred a comedy classic that would have been great
Jul 16 2016,positive,the vehement disdain for this years ghostbusters remake has flummoxed me to say the least  yearly filmgoers are bombarded with announcements of cinematic projects that might not tickle their fancy and worst cast scenario are able to look the other way and move on with their lives without having to spend two hours watching a movie that doesnt interest them  much as i adore them movies the last time i checked are not an art form a totalitarian government forces us to consume without choice  audiences are fortunate enough to have the opportunity to spend 1025 on anything theyd like to  on a different film perhaps  i think the adaptation of video game world of warcraft looks like an abomination  but as i try to be courteous toward fellow moviegoers who might think the opposite ive avoided vocalizing my disinterest within the comment sections of the facebook pages of entertainment weekly or empire partly because im welladjusted enough to keep such trivial opinions to myself because crass amplified disgust is tacky especially on social media and because i have better things to do than write angry sound bites for a public thats going to forget about me in a few hours anyway  but the backlash regarding 2016s allfemale ghostbusters has been so extreme that an outsider might come to the conclusion that something drastic might have happened to cause such fury as if law enforcement officials broke into the homes of vhs and dvd owners and destroyed all known copies of the 1984 classic   as if someone assassinated the original cast  as if ed woods reanimated carcass had been hired to write and direct  as if it suddenly were against the law to ignore a remake and simply rewatch the original  of course none of these melodramatic falsities bear a hint of truth but the comment section crybabies of the internet have acted as though they do  the trailer for ghostbusters has now become the most disliked in youtubes history  negative ratings flooded imdb before the movie even came out forums have become characterized by proclamations so absurd that i stumbled upon a post today that decided that before seeing the film that the only people that will like it are sjws or  if you can believe it  women  another exclaimed that one should see the film only if theyre looking for frilly comedy not meaningful comedy of its ancestors sort  but ghostbusters wasnt a meaningful comedy in the first place just a wonderful idiosyncratic romp with characters and scenarios so warm and so humorous that indelibility was unavoidable  and the 2016 reboot isnt trying to be a masterpiece either all it wants to do is take the shape of a likable summer blockbuster with hearty laughs by its side  is it as good as the original of course it isnt  but its better than ghostbusters ii and is certainly worth the price of your ticket  put aside needless points of comparison and youll notice that its a comedy with enough charm to stand on its own two feet  why the heated disfavor  the disarming quartet of the original who with the exception of the gonetoosoon harold ramis makes memorable cameos is replaced by the equally disarming quartet of melissa mccarthy kristen wiig leslie jones and kate mckinnon who are among the finest comediennes of their generation and do more than just pay tribute to their irreplaceable predecessors  in the 2016 version all play endearingly fickle parapsychologists with the exception of jones who portrays a loudmouthed mta worker driven by selffulfillment and the need to prove themselves in a doubtful world  not much different story wise that is than ivan reitmans envisioning no  the real difference lies in paul feig and katie dippolds screenplay which is a goldmine of sinewy oneliners and witty banter and the chemistry between the leads which is lovably offbeat but perfectly complementary  feig who also directs has proven himself as a dependable comedy filmmaker through such enthusiastically zany pieces as spy and bridesmaids which were similarly propelled by the talents of mccarthy and ghostbusters is no exception  its fueled by his sharp brand of humor and is able to forge new paths while also paying ample respect to the paragon its so indebted to  the cast is as comparatively exceptional straightmen mccarthy and wiig are spotlessly deadpan and jones and mckinnon long gems on saturday night live position themselves as hilarious breakouts distinctly of the moment  and chris hemsworth as the ghostbusters dimwitted secretary unexpectedly steals the film with his impeccable comedic timing  ignoring the ersatz cgi which looks paltry when considering the movies sizable 144 million budget and the relatively uninspired final showdown 2016s ghostbusters is nevertheless a rollicking spree with enough gusto to cause one to wonder what all the opposition was about to begin with  im sure the petty fanboys and stubborn naysayers will continue calling the film trash years after going on without having ever seen it  but that shouldnt stop you from enjoying yourself which you more likely than not will
Jul 16 2016,positive,loved it didnt expect to and was pleasantly surprised
Jul 16 2016,negative,absolute garbage i want my money back these reviews on here giving it 5 stars arent even real accounts sony duped me
Jul 16 2016,positive,really its a b but i put 5 stars to help balance out the unjustified hate
Jul 16 2016,positive,funniest movie ive seen in a long time perfect cast great plot amazing ghosts 1010 and kate mckinnon is 1110
Jul 16 2016,negative,just a mess overall bad story bad acting bad visuals not worth watching
Jul 16 2016,positive,i was pleasantly surprised by how good this was its not an amazing movie but i enjoyed it enough to watch it again and im probably going to buy it on dvd 3
Jul 16 2016,negative,the movie was funny but the plot lacked any of the depth that the previous films had a funny but shallow remake that would have worked better as a sequel
Jul 16 2016,negative,kristen wiig along with her cast play the same characters they play in every other movie along with that add in extremely forced jokes an embarrassingly insulting portrayal of men which is a complete backwards step for society and an obvious cash grab off the success of the original classic whatever mess you want to call the result this movie is exactly that
Jul 16 2016,positive,way better than the haters would lead you to believe give it a chance stay past the credits
Jul 16 2016,negative,someone paid for my way in and jesus christ i want someone to give me his money back what a disgrace of a movie
Jul 15 2016,negative,utter garbage  i cant believe i gave this movie a chance
Jul 15 2016,positive,a fun and funny movie to watch they did a great job at sticking to the theme as while starting a new thing they also did a great job at paying tribute to the former cast members without stealing the new casts thunder and losing focus on the new story  sure some of the dialogues seemed a bit forced specially on the comedy side of things but thats kind of ghostbusters is all well mostly about and the 80s feel they were going for  they played well with gender and racial roles bs subjects they never tried to hide what some people are calling a feminist hidden agenda so i dont get why so many complaints  well my male friend and i thoroughly enjoyed the movie and we both agreed it accomplishes what it set up to do
Jul 15 2016,positive,absolutely amazing im defiantly going to see it again and again hilariously funny and epic just an fyi in case you were suspicious about the audience rating there have been large groups of self proclaimed meninists aka people who hate women that are doing things they consider for men and are giving the movie terrible reviews without even seeing it so go watch it and give it a nice review as well
Jul 15 2016,positive,an excellent new take on the story
Jul 15 2016,negative,an insult to my childhood that pains me more than the new ninja turtles and transformers
Jul 15 2016,positive,i am totally eating my words i laughed a lot and actually enjoyed this movie
Jul 15 2016,positive,stands on its own pretty well has a decent story line separate from the original good character development and dialogue not perfect but very entertaining
Jul 15 2016,neutral,a rehash of ghostbusters  hollywood has definitely sunk to new lows to make a few bucks  the originality has sunk to the lowest depths ever  that being said is the film any good  on the plus  side is melissa mccarthy and kristen wiig  these are two very funny women and they work well off each other  the other two members of the crew are more forced and they fail to be as funny because they are trying so hard to be just that  the rest of the film only works sporadically  the laughs do happen once ina why but not enough  the biggest problem is that the movie fails to answer the biggest mystery surrounding it existencewhy
Jul 15 2016,positive,hilarious and goodnatured a fun summer comedy mccarthy and wiig are such huge comedic talents and i cant wait for jones and mckinnon to join their ranks 4 hilarious women and lots of nods to the original if youre looking for pure summer fun i would definitely recommend it dont listen to haters who are mad about the fact that theyre all women their gender in no way detracts from the silliness its a good movie go see it
Jul 15 2016,positive,i hadnt heard much about the movie prior so i didnt know what to expect having seen it this afternoon im left with some mixed feelings about this film i felt like the story was clever but some of the jokes felt forced as well as performances over acted     kristen wiig and melissa mccarthy are more often than not incredible when they perform in other roles however in this film i felt them to be a little out of place a good portion of the time making it more difficult for me to surrender myself to the story leslie jones was hilarious and awesome i honestly believed i wouldnt like her much in this film walking in but she really stood out and performed her role extremely well the actor that really made this film both difficult and hilarious for me was kate mckinnon at many times in the film i felt like she was channeling an amplified andy samberg sometimes it worked but many of her jokes felt more like they were a parody of an inside joke were not part of for me it made her character less organic and took me to a place of disbelief but all and all there were some funny jokes throughout by the entire cast    it is a loose reboot overall it has very little if not nothing to do with the previous ghostbuster films nor is it a recreation of the original the cameos from the previous actors didnt reprise their former roles and for me were more disruptive to the flow of the storyline than beneficial  though i do in fact love the original actors for instance i was excited to see bill murray in this file but had a difficult time not seeing or hearing him as dr peter venkman phd    my opinion is that 2016s ghostbusters is worth a look im sure many of you out there will love it im also sure itll have you laughing in some parts there are already a lot of positive reviews to help reinforce that belief but if someone asked if id see it a second time i wouldnt make any extra or special efforts to do so     however all that being said there are post credits for the og ghostbuster fans stick around the theater if you go see it
Jul 15 2016,positive,ignore the spam of those who probably have not even seen it it was a great time my teenage son and i have watched the originals many times and both of us really enjoyed this movie
Jul 15 2016,positive,good laughs and a good time simple as that
Jul 15 2016,negative,i guess they changed the definition of the word comedy a poor showcasing of people who are reasonably talented
Jul 15 2016,negative,this show is absolutely mediocre i have seen spy and melissa mccarthy was good in that and she did well in the actions scenes which is why im so baffled why she looked so bad here like the action scenes really reminds you of the actors acting in a green screen and their movement is so amateur home video like    none of the casts is in the wrong for this show i think the director and writers have to take the rap for it  i dont know i just feel theres not joy or reason for this show to exist outside of a franchise money grab
Jul 15 2016,positive,jokes were not wasted no lazy callbacks to the original were made  they actually tried to avoid callbacks except for one scene and some cameos but the scale and conflict were a very nice match for the original the style of cg seemed very intentionally reminiscent of the puppets and digital models of their predecessors despite complaints about how they were disappointing  lets not forget what were comparing them to barely a minute went by where i didnt laugh and the fast pace of jokes is typical for mccarthy and wiig which may make people think this is intended as cheap or a chick flick  not a term i enjoy  but if you look past how frequent the jokes are and enjoy what the jokes are youll have a great time
Jul 15 2016,positive,my alltime favorite movie has always been ghostbusters so i was excited yet nervous about what they would do with it  we were completely entertained the entire movie it was great fun there were plenty of good creepy ghost moments  mixed in with hilarious comedy there were a few parts that had tears of laughter rolling down our cheeks the nods to the original movie were fun to see  and the cameos brought joy to our hearts  go see it  have fun with ghostbusters all over again  
Jul 15 2016,positive,awesome totally recommend better than the first
Jul 15 2016,negative,meh terrible cast dumb jokes and mediocre story dont waste money on this movie
Jul 15 2016,positive,reasonably entertaining but really stupid and pretty forgettable since the jokes are quantity over quality
Jul 15 2016,positive,i was born at the end of 1982 and was just a toddler when the original was released in theatres i had to wait a few years for the videotape release and kept praying in vain that janine would pick up the proton pack i wanted so badly to play with the boys at catching the bad guys     27 years since gb ii i finally got a childhood wish granted and i laughed my head off i know that there are plenty of grouches out there who want nothing less than a shrine to ramisreitmans version but i would beg them to give it a chance  there are special effects in this film that they could never have pulled off in 1984 or 1989 that are worth watching i wont reveal what kate mckinnon does after she licks her proton guns in the trailer but i will say that i was bouncing up and down on my seat with gleeyes she broke the janine melnitz ceiling   chris hemsworth is surprisingly funny to watch and if you watch the credits you see him get funky  and there is even a sly commentary on dishonest politicians who do not beware the ides of march and the girls getting their due over andy garcias character
Jul 15 2016,positive,it has been a while since i have laughed this hard at a movie these women are my friends and i so refreshing to see women take the reigns and kick some butt without any reliance on men passes the bechdel test with flying colors and takes it a step further by being so damn smart enthusiastic dedicated and silly
Jul 15 2016,positive,loved it hilarious and totally entertaining ill definitely be going back to the theater to see it again this weekend
Jul 15 2016,negative,meh wait till its on cable
Jul 15 2016,positive,paul feig brings out the humor of his cast with kate mckinnon and chris hemsworth as the standouts some of the action was exciting however the references to the original film seemed forced slimer staypuft marshmallow man etc overall a very entertaining and funny film even if its not the original
Jul 15 2016,positive,worth watching not quite as funny as i remember the original being but still very entertaining i dont see why anyone is hating on this film  so what its a reboot it happens all the time
Jul 15 2016,negative,lame story never as goodas the original
Jul 15 2016,positive,theres no manhating agenda here so avoid the troll bs its a decently fun and funny reboot of a goofy 80s action comedy and ymmv but i had a good time watching mckinnon is great at being weird hemsworth is hilarious wiig and mccarthy arent anywhere near as funny as they were in bridesmaids but thats forgivable because overall this movie succeeds for what it is which by the by is a big budget summer action comedy so yes it turns into a cgi crapfest in a lackluster third act but thats literally every big budget summer movie anymore the problems here have nothing to do with gender unless thats a chip youve been diligent about setting on your own shoulder
Jul 15 2016,negative,awful completely awful this was a cartoon a shitty snl cartoon garbage
Jul 15 2016,positive,it was awesome omg omg omg ghostbusters didnt suck seriously dont believe the childhood ruined hype speaking as someone whos been obsessed with gb since i could watch movies i felt like i was watching a true ghostbusters movie     i went in with low expectations because of all the baggage this movie carried so take that into account if you will and lets face it your never going to replace the original youre just not but it didnt feel like they were trying to do that it felt like they were building its own alternate universe while leaving the first two films alone to its own sacred universe though it wasnt as funny as the original it was funny but ill tell ya this though it was scarier and more action packed than the first movie    it wasnt without its flaws mild spoilers slimer doesnt need a girlfriend the fallout boy version of the song sucks and the antagonist of the story feels a little weak tea but those and a few other small gripes are not enough for me to hate or even meh this film    im officially a fan of ghostbusters answer the call     im dying to see a sequel    im buying a digital copy    i welcome it with loving arms and weepy relief i seriously shed a tear for how relieved i was into my nerd canon
Jul 15 2016,positive,loved it hilarious and fun to watch  however a mum had to leave with her  young son 79ish because he was scared it really ought to have been rated m in australia classification fail the movie most certainly is not a fail and will enrich the childhoods of current young people guys quit whinging watch with an open mind and just enjoy the ride
Jul 15 2016,positive,dont believe the haters this film is funny and well done go see it and judge for yourself
Jul 15 2016,positive,im a 30 year ghostbusters fan   had to say i had zero interest in seeing this and went to just hate on it but this is actually really good fans please gove this a chance its a good movie not 1984 ghostbusters but i really enjoyed it which surprised me i thought it was going to be terrible and hoped it would bomb but now i see a future for this franchise go see it judge it yourself go into it unbiased and just enjoy the movie i really hate to write this but im a fan of the new movie 
Jul 15 2016,positive,i loved this movie the jokes were funny and while it paid homage to the original it was still able to stand on its own as they say
Jul 15 2016,positive,oh man it was everything i wanted it to be and more  i was prepared to be disappointed but this movie really delivered  i mean dont go in comparing to the first film but if youre looking for more ghostbusters and everything that makes the concept awesome then its a great flick  and yes kid me would have also loved the heck out of this movie too   for the record yes im an 80s kid born in 83 one of my earliest memories is ghostbusters  loved the sequel loved the real ghostbusters cartoon and as a young teenager i religiously recorded extreme ghostbusters which ok maybe wasnt amazing but basically anything ghostbusters was something i obsessed over  so when i say there is plenty of fan service for you in this film im for real  the whole theatre was into it so it wasnt awkward that i spent most of it laughing my ass off  i might even go see this one again  i seriously cant believe the backlash we saw all over the internet but now that were seeing good reviews hit the internet maybe all those people can get bored with it and move on  ill say one thing  you shouldnt go in expecting this to completely retread the first movie or try to capture the same feeling  this does its own thing and it benefits from doing so  im thrilled it turned out how it did and hopefully we can expect ghostbusters to go full on franchise and we get some more movies
Jul 15 2016,positive,loved it   i expected to be disappointed but left with a smile on my face  cant wait for the sequel  cuz u know its coming  i dont even like sequels   great job
Jul 15 2016,positive,a lot of people hated this movie before it came out and rated it poorly before watching  dont listen this movie is definitely worth it
Jul 15 2016,positive,one of the most entertaining and effective action comedy of the year the cast is magnificently hilarious the story is smart light and funny the perfect summer movie director feig doesnt seem to ever disappoint special effects were campy just like a ghostbusters movie should be cant wait for the sequel a
Jul 15 2016,positive,i loved it this movie its just amazing
Jul 15 2016,positive,omg stop remaking films already
Jul 15 2016,positive,its funny how people are judging this movie without even seeing it let a new generation enjoy the good silly harmless fun ghostbusters has to offer little girls will be able to see themselves on screen this time and im sure kids and everyone who is not too busy sending hate hiding behind a computer will like this film
Jul 15 2016,positive,i dont get all the negative hype about this movie saw it thought it was great
Jul 15 2016,positive,i didnt have any interest in seeing this movie but i went anyways and i have to say i loved it awesome remake must see bc the previews do not do it justice super funny and cant wait for the next one
Jul 15 2016,positive,loved it fun fresh kate mckinnon steals the show completely with bizarre charisma
Jul 15 2016,positive,it was well castes funny and original aka not a remake a reboot well worth seeing in 3d
Jul 15 2016,negative,fyi sony movie studios has manipulated us using what i like to call the emperors new clothes effect people in that story were afraid to admit they did not see the clothes because that meant they were unintelligent well movie studios like controversy sometimes like with the new ghostbusters movie i know they employed this technique for their marketing how do i know thiswell i was writing nonsexist well thought out opinions and my post as well as some others i read were being deleted by sony pictures on the other hand wildly sexist and illiterate remarks were being left untouched this can only mean they wanted these controversial remarks maybe even had a hand in their creation by stirring this pot made it a huge media frenzy now everyone has to see the movieand everyone on both sides have fallen for it    in other wordsthey artificially created a gender conflicted to help sell this movie
Jul 15 2016,positive,i havent laughed that hard at a movie in a long time
Jul 15 2016,positive,the most unexpected bustin feel good movie of 2016 ive been a fan of gb since the spooktacular show at universal studios orlando back in the early 90s and i can a sure you the reboot will not crush your childhood in any way or in any ghost form the reboot doesnt hurt men pretty much everyone is a complete idiot in gb16 i mean everyone this unpaid review is coming from a guy who fully hated the marketing terrible job from sony literally terrible job with the marketing truly gb16 was a blast and it doesnt deserve the hate it just doesnt but i can understand why the only thing i wish they could have fixed was the pointless marvel villain in the first two acts still loved his ultimate form also the cameos didnt felt forced in my opinion except for murrays hes still amazingly funny in his role better than rock the kasbah thats for sure    probably the best 3d experience in a while very different and unique     ps holtzmann was fu awesome     heres my gb top list     5 the real ghostbusters   4 gbii   3 gbiii the video game 2009   2 gb16   1 gb84    
Jul 15 2016,positive,funny loved it so much
Jul 15 2016,negative,mildly entertaining but cant compare even a tiny bit to the original
Jul 15 2016,positive,this was an hilarious movie with a wellwritten story played out by wonderful actors with fantastic roles the tributes to the original added a wonderful touch but even without them this movie carries on the spirit of the first ghostbusters right through the end everyone needs to go see this movie now
Jul 15 2016,positive,stop hating  this was a fun film
Jul 15 2016,positive,amazing stellar performances great writing and quality fx take your friends and see it multiple times while its in theaters its totally worth it
Jul 15 2016,positive,i thought this reboot was great it had so many cameos which brought back the feel of the original movies the four main characters  were perfect kevin and they gave the audience a lot to chew on i loved the whole story and i laughed about every 7 seconds
Jul 15 2016,positive,much better than i expected  the comic references to the original added a wry twist casting utterly brilliant and refreshing funny and energising to see the role reversal
Jul 15 2016,positive,i dont think i have laugh this much in a film in months i highly recommend this film and it was a perfect return to such a dear 80s and 90s films and the cameos were perfect loved it
Jul 15 2016,negative,it was really just a long string of the same jokes from beginning to end it reminded me of some kind of nickelodeon movie rather than the remake it was going for granted not as bad as youtube said it was going to be but they were right about cliche predictions
Jul 15 2016,positive,making many winks and nods to the movie we all love while still leaving your childhood memories intact ghostbusters sits predictably in the valley between the 1984 original and paul feiges own bridesmaids while it may lack the strong plot and wit of the former as well as the belly laughs and the edge of the latter taken on its own terms this remake of the beloved classic is still very enjoyable solely on the strengths of its wonderful cast and lighthearted tongueincheek energy
Jul 15 2016,positive,the ladies brought the comedy and the original cast that are still here rip harold ramos are either ancillary characters or cameos parts that made a good movie better  recommend seeing this movie in 3d      stick around till the end of credits it is worth it  i saw it in the imax 3d theater this the perfect movie for 3d  made you feel like you where going to get slimmed a couple of times
Jul 15 2016,positive,i am a big fan from way back loved this take it is a great start to a new film set ready for more right away soon the better
Jul 15 2016,positive,overall this movie is okay if you take your family out to see it youll most likely have a good time but from a review standpoint it has its flaws the movie starts off with a strong beginning with the haunted house tour it sets us up for an exiting movie but as the movie progresses it gets more and more slow paced and it tries to overcomplicate itself in pointless areas where it could be adding detail in other areas instead for example there is a scene where they go into elaborate detail as to how the ghostbusters logo came to be when it was so pointless to try to explain the movie was plot heavy in special effects and had acting that felt so forced at times it didnt even feel realistic the biggest flaw for the movie is that it lacked the charisma of the original it may be bigger and bolder than the original but it doesnt even come close to bill murray and dan aykroyds iconic and lovable characters from the 1984 movie we came to know it did have its redeeming factors including cool special effects and laughable humor at times mostly from kate mckinnons role as holtzmann however  i do have to give them props to it trying to be original and i feel like people were so quick to react to the trailer that they didnt realize that half of the scenes were way different than they thought they were like the beginning of the movie overall it isnt amazing but it isnt bad either
Jul 15 2016,positive,i really liked it i thought it was really funny i liked the relationships between the main characters the homages to the original were clever and didnt take anything away from the movie if you hadnt seen the original movie but added something if you had and i had a great time was it the original no but it wasnt trying to be word for word exactly like it i was a new movie and it seems like the are setting up a second movie that i would definitely see boo to all the haters out there it did exactly what i wanted a ghosterbusters movie to do it had a funny main cast all of whom i liked and who were funny it had a lot of crazy sciencey gobletygoog it had cool weapons that definitely took it up a notch from the original it was good fun it was everything i asked for
Jul 15 2016,positive,the new ghostbusters is so much fun smiles and laughs from beginning to end the cast was awesome great way to reboot the franchise
Jul 15 2016,negative,utter garbage do not waste your moneywait for redbox horrible writing unlike able stereotypical characters a disgrace to the franchise as a whole if you want to see a true ghostbusters sequelplay the videogame that was released in 2009 it was like some god awful snl skit neon cgi for everyone
Jul 15 2016,positive,funny witty and just overall a super entertaining movie  the ladies did a tremendous job and the dialogue was great
Jul 15 2016,negative,if you want to see a good comedy starring kristen wiig and melissa mccarthy watch bridesmaids
Jul 15 2016,positive,loved loved loved although im still confused about the balloons tbh
Jul 15 2016,positive,this movie far exceeded my expectations there were lots of familiar faces and every original ghostbuster made a cameo except for one leslie jones kate and chris were hilarious i had a permanent smile on my face the entire movie and chriss ditzy character kevin will go down in history for being one of the best dumb blondes ever i saw this movie on opening night and i know many who saw it simply because of the intense sexist backlash the film recieved its probably going to get a sequel and its probably going to get a lot of fake negative reviews its a good movie period the kind you should see with friends in the theature a tiny screen doesnt do it justice its funny and a great reboot that had me and my friends wanting to watch the originals do yourself a favor and call yourself over to the movies to see ghostbusters
Jul 15 2016,negative,this movie is an insult to the original 1984 version and everything to come after it with a constant barrage of badtasteless jokes and horrible lines children may enjoy it but as a longtime ghostbusters fan this is a disgrace i feel bad for all of the talented actors for being stuck in this mess of a screenplay
Jul 15 2016,positive,ok you guys serious talk here  ghostbusters  genre brand new nostalgia  grade a  the new ghostbusters film is legitimately awesome i would have been happy if it just didnt suck but no its absolutely topofthecharts toolegittoquit amazeballs from start to finish  i will take a brief moment here to turn to the camera and say aside sotto voce suck it haters because i am just that mature  the basic story beats are there but they dont make the mistake of trying to map the four characters onto the original quartet the characters are legitimately new and not just interpretations of venkman egon and company  kate mckinnon absolutely steals all the candy that candy you have it belongs to kate now  chris hemsworth is having the time of his life managing to thread the needle between dumb and charming  the people who made this movie clearly love the original ghostbusters and they check off all the boxes there is legit fan service here but it all feels natural and integrated rather than just being shoehorned in for the sake of cheap nostalgia  their cameo game is absolutely on point i am not going to spoil them for you just know that it is on point  go see ghostbusters because its an engaging laughoutloud funny comedy that shows great respect and reverence for the franchise it has revived and stands on its own as a fantastic summer comedy  also stay through the credits you dont want to miss the stinger at the end
Jul 15 2016,positive,i really liked it great seeing the way it came together maybe a few more ghosts in the beginning were needed all and all ill see it again
Jul 15 2016,negative,not bad enough to deserve all of its online hate but not good enough to warrant its own existence this 2016 ghostbusters would have been better off never being made though it has a few good laughs its overall bogged down by a weak script bad characters and confusing pacing editing and directing who ya gonna call not these ghostbusters
Jul 15 2016,positive,the movie was terrific  it had plenty of funny moments as well as a few scary ones the homage to the original was well done and quite subtle it had me smiling the whole time with an excellent portrayal of distinct characters with different talents it was a wonderful adventure definitely going to watch it again and im highly recommending it to friends
Jul 15 2016,positive,originalmy family loved it
Jul 15 2016,positive,loved it super fun completed exceeded my expectations
Jul 15 2016,neutral,this films humor seemed far to forced missed its punches and was overall a not funny film the original ghostbusters worked so well because they werent trying to be funny and the humor centered a lot around rays selfcentered ego this cast seemed to far spread out and they kept going around and around with their jokes when it really should of been a oneanddone kind of deal    this one was a meh and would be great if they could just let the humor flow naturally instead of trying to hard  because that is what they did    i will say however that there was a lot of humor aimed towards scenarios and things that women would get all too well and that was really refreshing to seehear
Jul 15 2016,positive,standing on its own 2 feet as an outstanding solid film kate mckinnon is a comedy gem as is surprisingly chris hemsworth hilarious all the way through
Jul 15 2016,negative,hoo boy ghostbusters is bad  like not i want my money back bad more i want my money back and a personal apology from everyone involved in making it bad    bad  bad
Jul 15 2016,positive,with four very likeable leads and a very funny performance by chris hemsworth this new imagining has some great jokes and some new ideas the plot is a bit baggy but it does not matter it is first and for most a comedy it is a fun blockbuster which will leave you smiling
Jul 15 2016,negative,paul feigs sexist opinion of men on full display combined with exposing his short comings as a director and writer oh and fire your editor talk about amateur hack work go back to gender swap parody films feig you got a talent for making those types of films this reboot is a complete miss fire it is not a ghostbusters movie it is a pandering marketing tool made for the lowest common denominator    the real tragedy of this film is it could have been good you had a good cast it was a failure of sonys executives giving this directorscript writer a project and brand that was beyond his scope or ability
Jul 15 2016,negative,eh not terrible but not good
Jul 15 2016,positive,saw the movie with my entire family and everyone from age 7 to 63 thoroughly enjoyed i remember when gb84 came out saw it in theaters with my dad and i can only hope my kids got a thrill watching this as well tons of fun the ladies are hilarious together pays enough homage but has its own independent inventiveness its not about four women in a reboot its about having a fun time watching four underdogs do some pretty cool things
Jul 15 2016,positive,the internet is why we cant have nice things  this was a solid move i want a sequal
Jul 15 2016,positive,i drove around with a ghostbusters symbol on my car for a year after seeing the original so i am a diehard fan  this ghostbusters is better    dont listen to negative reviews  you can tell by what some are saying that they didnt even see the movie just the previews    i walked in with little expectation and came out happy as heck about how they did this movie    it is not feminist or racist as faux reviewers claim  it is just plain entertaining
Jul 15 2016,positive,well cast and filled with fun cameos from the older films this movie was enjoyable and a lot of fun i went in looking at this film as a separate entity from the original and was not let down
Jul 15 2016,negative,it started off really bad but by the third act as if anyone can possibly figure out when that started it managed to elevate itself to just bad
Jul 15 2016,positive,i only wish i could give this movie a 5 star rating im an 80s kid who grew up loving the original 2 ghostbusters movies  i have a portrait of vigo the carpathian in my kitchen and i made my daughter a slimer costume for this premiere haha and i was so afraid of being disappointed by a reboot but this is not a remake its a beautiful hilarious talentfilled tribute     a mustsee in theaters that my whole family loved the whole audience stayed until after the credits and laughed the whole time also kept my twoyearold entertained throughout the entire running time for her first movie theater experience    it seems like the minimalistic bad reviews are mostly written by trolls who probably  havent seen the movie
Jul 15 2016,positive,less funny  more scary  action packed than the original this reboot stands fairly well on its own the cast of ladies are brilliant even when the script isnt a great summer blockbuster bustin still makes ya feel good 
Jul 15 2016,negative,its fucking garbage save your money shitty humor horrible visuals awful story insulting to anyone with a right mind so many awful stereotypes its a shitty version of the original movie nothing makes sense
Jul 15 2016,positive,hilarious i havent laughed that much at a movie in ages totally a must see
Jul 15 2016,negative,mckinnon was great the rest was just meh
Jul 15 2016,positive,funny and the snl women did great
Jul 15 2016,positive,our packed theater was laughing the entire time this movie was funny and fresh while still being spooky and nostalgic the main characters were distinct and had wonderful chemistry the plot stood on its own and there was plenty of fun action as well as an underlying message of friendship little girls and boys will both be inspired to be ghostbusters and i think that that is simply fantastic
Jul 15 2016,positive,really fun movie much better than i expected the cast is great really hope this does well enough to get a sequel
Jul 15 2016,negative,a spy kids 3 in 3d of sequals it honestly doesnt get much more try hard than this movie im a big fan of hunger game divergent and generally any good movie which this is not    much like batman v superman this movie had a garbage agenda that it wanted to push and both of these movies belong in the trash
Jul 15 2016,positive,average summer comedy nothing special good time killer
Jul 15 2016,positive,it was nostalgic without rehashing the same story  i loved it and looking forward to the sequel
Jul 15 2016,positive,it was a solid movie that can stand on its own while it will never compete with the original it is enjoyable and funny
Jul 15 2016,positive,i legitimately loved this movie i walked in expecting it to be awful but still wanting it to be good because i love ghostbusters so maybe i just liked it because i wanted to like it but oh well i enjoyed it ill buy the bluray combo pack the day it come out no question
Jul 15 2016,negative,not half as good as the original i wanted to like it but just couldnt not unwatchable but it never came together  previews were funnier the the movie cameos were weak and felt forced
Jul 15 2016,positive,i think a lot of people are reviewing the movie based on previews and their biased feeling because they cant let go of the original i liked the movie and think it offers a lot of potential for the franchise id like them to take more risks away from the originals in the sequel but i think this was a good start and look forward to more
Jul 15 2016,positive,i saw this twice today already and i just wanna say that this movie turned out to be what i had expected to be and it was better than the original 1984 movie and its followup sequel please sony make a sequel happen
Jul 15 2016,negative,wow this was bad seriously bad i grew up on ghostbusters and was excited to finally have a new movie but this was a complete let down this is mom got too drunk and didnt show up for my graduation levels of disappointment  i knew that no one could top the original cast but i didnt think anyone could ever outright take such an awesome and novel idea and not only destroy it but fail to execute even in the slightest    comparing this to the original ghostbusters would be like comparing the wnba to the 1992 us olympic basketball team    about 13 of the theater walked out but since i paid i decided to sit and watch the entire thing i regret not leaving
Jul 15 2016,negative,that hurt umm im not really sure what i just watched the only thing i know is that it was awful
Jul 15 2016,positive,this movie is a reboot and it is amazing you will laugh so hard you will cry the nostalgia beats will hit you right in the feels the best best superhero movie so far this year and yes its better than superman v batman
Jul 15 2016,positive,actually so funny and well made
Jul 15 2016,positive,a great reboot the girls are hilarious especially kate mckinnon oh man she is amazing in this movie a star was born in this movie similar to bill murray she will go on to do great things and can be diverse in her characters as opposed to todays new comedy actors like ferrell hart and even melissa mccarthy playing the same character in every movie definitely worth seeing in theatres and its too bad people wont accept women in this reboot written by dan akyroyd and harold ramis who wrote the first two movies a lot of people dont like change but if you can wrap your head around change this movie is hilarious only negative aspect is a little too much cgi but thats really no big deal hope everyone enjoys it as much as i did
Jul 15 2016,positive,i had a blast seeing ghostbusters most of the jokes were great the four leads were fantastic and it paid tribute to the original while still standing on its own fun action great comedy and a couple good scares along the way my only real problem was the villain was a bit flat but overall the whole thing worked highly recommended
Jul 15 2016,positive,i guarantee the low audience score is from all the trolls who wont even give it a chance which is a loss for them because it was awesome haters gonna hate this movie was as ridiculous and fun as the first one with plenty of fantastic moments and oneliners loved the way each actor played their character i rarely want to see a movie again in the theater and this was one of them
Jul 15 2016,positive,it was so good  super fun movie kate mckinnon became one of my favorite funny people with this kate got an applause in my theater during a particularly badass scene she was incredible but the entire cast was great  it was a different movie but kept the same heart as the original the trailer didnt do the movie justice the characters in this werent parallels of those in the original they each had time to let the characters grow and were their own dont be a jerk it had great cameos awesome throwbacks and your childhood is still in tact the ending was a bit anticlimactic for me the most important part however is that it completely holds up on its own for anyone boycotting this movie or giving it a poor review for no reason here is from harold ramis himself to his daughter umm no its fine its business violet the cartoon is its own thing the same way you used to ask if the fans knew i wasnt really egon well im not its a character there was a different superman when i was a kid things change well some things i think we have a ways to go before we get a hunky jewish cartoon character    anyone can be a ghostbuster
Jul 15 2016,positive,very funny movie lots of laughs
Jul 15 2016,negative,lets get the obvious elephant in the room out of the way no my rating has nothing to do with the woman cast all of the cast are actresses i love and felt truly bad for watching them stumble their way through this obnoxious script    that being said this film is vile its not even a reboot its a direct remake of the original  even down to the original ghostbusters not existing its lame its not funny it hyper focuses on jokes to the point where any and all spirit no pun intended of the original is drained from the film hyper focus on fantastic elements sexism and not just towards men some towards women too and racism galore and furthermore it just reeks of cash grab avoid like the plague
Jul 15 2016,negative,this movie feels like it wanted to be ghostbusters but failed once it started treating men females and race as a thing     let me explain and sorry for bad spelling or anything im literally at the movie theater watching this right now as i type this    in this movie all men are stupidly evil creeps who are to dumb to live  and even the final enemy is killed via shooting the dick the movie tells you that any man in power is a fuck up and stupidly cruel    the black femaleswait i mean the 1 black female ghostbuster is a racist stereotypical black woman from the 8090s that has no education or understanding of anything the white ladys are saying but is saved cause of street smart let me explain again she is a black lady who is only good at giving you directions and getting you a car if you want proof go see the movie cause in one scene they say  were scientists and patty they basically singled out the one black character as the useless uneducated person by doing this little joke    some of the jokes they did are just plain bad as it trys to be funny by doing female jokes but fail i can tell you right now that half of the females with me watching this are disgusted by the jokes and hated how they used  queef over and over again  i  even got to see one of the girls i came with look as her friend with a death stare for making a queef joke    in the end if they really wanted to make a females ghostbusters they could have used the  janine melnitz kylie griffin and dana barrett i blame paul feig as he is nothing but sexist to men because of how stupid little kids treated him in the past  the funny thing is that instead of using the abuse that he had as a child to create something   gorgeous he allowed to consume him to the point that it slowly festered inside of him and made him a manchild who hates his own willy
Jul 15 2016,positive,very funny an excellent reboot made in just the same spirit of the first but wonderfully its own with the new cast character of holtzmann is the best closely followed by patty     my husband and i laughed throughout and were so pleased we went to see it
Jul 15 2016,positive,loved it  ghosts were scarier and the actors were funnier  great movie
Jul 15 2016,negative,horrible not funny cameos are campy characters are stereotyped and one dimensional effects gets this 25 out of 10 in my book dont waste your money i had a free regal cinema pass
Jul 15 2016,positive,pleasantly surprised indeed  while the original is still king  for me this was an excellent reboot with a well  remixed story and likeable cast  i felt most of the jokes were spot on and the cameos were great  make sure to stay till the end of the credits
Jul 15 2016,positive,absolutely delightful and fun if you hated it youre a grump
Jul 15 2016,positive,awesome movie fantastic cast  so much better than the originals
Jul 15 2016,positive,had a lot of fun with this movie 
Jul 15 2016,negative,even by the look of the traileri could tell that this would be corny also i cant stand lesslie jones her characters on snl are repititve and stereotypical
Jul 15 2016,positive,one of the best i have seen in a long time
Jul 15 2016,positive,everything i could have hoped for and more i honestly dont know how they did it but im in so many kinds of love with this movie
Jul 15 2016,negative,these 4 women are very funny but not in this movie
Jul 15 2016,positive,one of the best comedies i have seen in awhile
Jul 15 2016,positive,loved it very fun i screamed twice
Jul 15 2016,negative,this movie isnt really good at all many of the people that like the ghostbusters movie was because of the way they went around the story and also that the characters were actually likeable but this movie doesnt have any of that and no its not because they are women i actually like that but its just that the movie isnt good at all
Jul 15 2016,positive,i loved it the only time it fell a little flat for me was in the call backs like using the hearse otherwise it was an original story with an original take none of characters were female versions of  i loved that paul feig used some of his other space cast in the show to great effect mostly i loved the four leads  who are amazing it was the funnest summer blockbuster ive seen in years
Jul 15 2016,positive,i think it was funny warm and full of action
Jul 15 2016,negative,the reclining chairs in theater entertained my friends and i more than this movie
Jul 15 2016,positive,saw it with my family and we found it entertaining and thoroughly delightful 3d effects were done really well and provided both laughed and a few  jump scares
Jul 15 2016,positive,great dialogue chemistry and special effects do this classic franchise justice very funny
Jul 15 2016,positive,video review for ghostbusters    
Jul 15 2016,neutral,largely uninspired and the jokes were mostly i guess off maybe it was just the timing the directorcast took with them i mean its not horrible but not much better than the poorly chopped trailer    the movie mightve done better if theyd focused more on the timing and less on the zany design of stuff ultimately the movies props couldnt overcome the internal consistency issues and maybe feigs sense of directorial timing perhaps the cast thought the timing would work out better after the cuts were made many of the jokes couldve worked if not for the poor setups and in a couple places obvious this should appeal to grrl power payoff
Jul 15 2016,negative,why did they even make this it had no fan base to begin with now it has even less than nothing fat ugly actresses too
Jul 15 2016,positive,im thinking most of these bad reviews are from people who havent seen it saw it tonight absolutely hilarious
Jul 15 2016,positive,super funny and really enjoyable 
Jul 15 2016,negative,paul fieg needs to hang himself dont waste your money
Jul 15 2016,positive,wow i just got done with the 7pm showing of the new ghostbusters here in nyc at the amc on 42 and here are some of my initial thoughts     there is more attention to special effects than to humor   this film hasnt gotten very far past the idea stage its jokes characters and story line are as wispy as the ghosts themselves and a good deal less substantial   as for feig directing this is his movie first and foremost and its another of the messy nearmiss films in which he seems to specialize   as long as the film retains its playfulness and keeps the stakes low things are promising   there are also far too many loose ends in the screenplay    in short the cast would be even more welcome if their talents were used in the service of something genuinely witty and coherent rather than as an end in themselves    just kidding those are more or less direct quotes from the 1984 new york times review of the original movie i added as for feig directing and subbed the cast for mr murray in the last quote its just a gentle reminder however substantial a role the original movie may now play in popular culture in 1984 it was just another summer popcorn flick    after watching the new movie its clear to me that for everyone involved it was a labor of love are there some cheesy parts of course does every single joke hit not every single one but pretty close it is fun absolutely can you see it with your kids yes but they will get scared ive been frighten of library stacks my entire life does the movie adhere to the spirit of the original film resoundingly yes    go see it youll like it its funny yes the special effects are better and more intense than the first movie but how else are you gonna get the attention of kids raised on pokemon go and kate mckinnon is a god damn american treasure i need more of her in my life
Jul 15 2016,negative,simply terrible  flat jokes and formulaic story that told us nothing new about the direction this reboot was supposed to be and failed to use the talent of the cast  expected so much more  dont waste your time watch the original
Jul 15 2016,negative,how in the world the tomatometer is so high is beyond me one can only speculate that the integrity of this website is piss poor and should not be trusted under any circumstance 73 give me a break either the system is rigged or they havent seen the same movie that i saw ghostbusters was a failure in every sense from the misrepresentation of both female and male roles to the failure of trying to appear original with a gender reversal in an appeal to garner a larger female audience  in turn making a mockery out of the original movie and cast
Jul 15 2016,neutral,this movie felt very uneven to me  i enjoyed the opening scene and then the next 45 minutes were rather painful and then it gradually started to redeem itself but never to the point i left feeling completely satisfied  early on the acting was rather bland forced chemistry was lacking  kate mckinnons attempts at humor early on just needed a consistent follow up of cricket noises  her acting was also pretty awful early on but she did become bearable as the movie went on  kristen wiig hasnt really been funny since bridesmaids  melissa mcarthys comedic talents were not put to good use  the only actors that really brought any humor to the movie were chris hemsworth and leslie jones  i will say the ghost special effects were good and there were some nice nods to nostalgia but overall this movie was too inconsistent for me to give it a great rating
Jul 15 2016,negative,watched the movie tonight on 3d imax it was truly a terrible movie  the only redeeming qualities were the special effects  terrible acting and crude humor  what a waste of time and money
Jul 15 2016,positive,this movie was absolutely fantastic and kate mckinnon is a beautiful magic van de graaff generator would absolutely see again and to all the trolls who flood the internet with negative reviews ive got two words for you and they arent get out
Jul 15 2016,positive,saw the movie loved it dont believe the haters
Jul 15 2016,positive,fun summertime fluff not winning any awards but it is not meant to it is just a fun july movie with big effects and lots of laughs it is lighthearted and the cast seems to be having fun the whole time which is infectious
Jul 15 2016,positive,not as good as the original but still good  it was actually very funny
Jul 15 2016,negative,one of the worst films ive ever seen i dont even do reviews but i felt like warning people this pig sucks it made my vomit want to puke terrible casting extremely stereotyped marginally racist half hearted comedy with zero less than zero chemistry     chris hemsworth is the only reason to see the film and hes only in it for a few quick laughs its a bore with really bad visual effects really just plain bad
Jul 15 2016,positive,i just finished watching ghostbusters so i can honestly say it hilarious especially kate mckinnon who made the audience laugh with just a wink 
Jul 15 2016,positive,spectacularly cast hilarious the ghosts were actually quite frightening a joy to watch everyone in my theater was laughing aloud
Jul 15 2016,positive,this was good but they could have increased the elements of this storyline for a great movie for starters there is still a subculture of people who dress like the original ghostbusters my point is that the original movies made a huge impact they should have tied in the old with the new take jurassic   world for instance the show got the support of the original fans because they connected the storylines    the show is as funny as ever still they could have had melissa mccartney and leslie jones grow in character as some of the main themes in the movie while its a funny show and i will see it again i see so much more the writers could have given to both melissa and leslies parts
Jul 15 2016,positive,sony really needs to think about firing the team who marketed this movie   ghostbusters starring kristen wiig melissa mccarthy kate mckinnon leslie jones chris hemsworth and directed by paul feig the reboot to the 80s classic tells the story of two scientist who wrote a book about paranormal activity but then went separate ways one went the respectable route erin played by kristen wiig while the other abby played by mellissa mccarthy continued to try and prove the existence of ghosts fate brings them together once again when they encounter a ghost and then must try to prove what they saw is real does this sound similar to the original ghostbusters it doesnt because it isnt the film tells a new story with new characters and does a good job in doing it   the trailers for this movie had me worried they seemed not to tell an original story and looked to have many of the same beats from the original movie it looked like they had a library ghost scene they used the same lines from the first film they showed the fire station the first team used as a base in the first trailer what this film actually does is tell a new story with new characters while it doesnt work perfectly it is entertaining and stands on its own i dont understand why the marketing team who promoted this movie decided to try and rely on nostalgia from the original movies to drum up excitement it backfired in a most spectacular way there is a fine line with not giving too much story away in trailers and getting people excited to see the movie they should have relied more on the differences this movie had from the original instead of its similarities   the characters are all new and different from the first cast kristen wiig does a good job in playing the straight laced up tight scientist she is funny in the film and most of her jokes hit mellissa mccarthy does well with her role paul feig seems to always get the best most reigned in performances from mccarthy and does so again in ghostbusters i loved kate mckinnons crazy nut job scientist holtzman but she is going to be polarizing either you are going to love what she does or hate it i dont think everything she did worked but most of it did i was most worried with leslie jones in her role but she was funny and wasnt as over the top as she seemed to be in the trailers i do wish they would have made her some type of scientist the show stealer for me was chris hemsworth who played the receptionist for the new business he was fantastic every joke he had made me laugh  he had great comedic timing  i even liked what they did with him in the third act of the film but it was one of the only things story wise that stood out in the end of the movie   the story falls apart at the end of the film the motivations for the main villain are not explored enough to be clear and the ending feels rushed there is also major chunks missing from the last part of the movie it is painfully obvious a major scene or two is missing from the last third of the movie but there is supposed to be a directors cut of the film im not sure why they would have cut these scenes unless it would have pushed the movie to r status  i would be surprised if what was cut would have pushed that particular barrier im not sure if adding a few of these scene back would have fixed the final part of the movie but i think it would have helped i liked the setup the story was going for in the first part of the film but it goes off the rails at the end   i did however enjoy many of the ghost fight scenes found in the last part of the movie holtzman in particular has a fantastic fight and all of the new toys she creates in the film get put to great use i liked the cg ghost in the film many probably wont but i thought they looked great and where used well throughout the movie the ghost fighting scenes are some of the best parts of the film and this with most of the comedy made ghostbusters a treat to watch it is far from a perfect film with the way they tell the story and the constant cameos jammed in the movie they could have done away with the bill murry character and a few others and the movie would have been improved i get having the cameos the characters created just dont fit the tone of the film and they all stand out instead of fit into the movie   this being said i liked the film it was enjoyable and i could see myself watching it again i for one never hated the idea of a new ghostbusters movie i did wish they would have made it connected to the originals but i was okay with a reboot i was just happy to get more ghostbusters which is something i had been wanting since the second film was released nothing is going to ruin my enjoyment of the first two films the first is close to perfect and i still really enjoy the second so maybe its not surprising that i enjoyed this one i think the film is worth seeing and worth seeing multiple times i know many dont agree but if you give it a chance i think you can enjoy the new imaging
Jul 15 2016,negative,meh theres a reason bill murray was phoning in his cameo too much show not enough tell
Jul 15 2016,positive,funnier than the original what an amazing cast
Jul 15 2016,negative,worst use of a franchise license i have ever seen disgusting
Jul 15 2016,negative,girlfriend didnt even enjoy it which was my reason for going i yawned so much during this movie i had tears in my eyes the saying bored to tears wasnt invented for ghostbusters 2016 but it fits the bill
Jul 15 2016,positive,fun blockbuster funny jokes and some surprisingly great action
Jul 15 2016,negative,thought this was a new movie not a remake wrong a ripoff of the first with the lame humor of an adam sandler movie and the scare of a scooby doo cartoon waste of money wouldve been better if they had the remaining cast involved as trainers or joining to help at the end the cameos sucked shame on the original cast members backing this movie up
Jul 15 2016,positive,just finished seeing for the first time love it great story and characters go see it
Jul 15 2016,positive,i dont know what you are all complaining about sure its not comparable to the first movie its not even comparable to the tunguska blast of 1909     nonetheless this is a fun film that pays homage to the original movie im sure harold ramis would have enjoyed it
Jul 15 2016,negative,either the majority of the critics are raging 3rd wave feminists or they have lost all objectivity and naively delusional as to what is good and bad but lets just call a spade a spade  this movie is likely the worst of all of the recent bad hollywood remakes  it was an attempt at a cash grab and its likely going to fail  dont trust anyone who tells you they think this movie is in any way objectively good  they are more than likely lying in order to keep pushing a failed agenda and keep themselves relevant
Jul 15 2016,negative,painful to watch right from the start feel bad for the cast who are not really that terrible paul feig has lost all direction in this his attempt to take a shot at the male dominant community there was much potential for this film sadly none of it was discovered
Jul 15 2016,positive,i went in this movie with extremely low expectations i had seen the trailers which didnt make the movie look very good however when i walked out of the theater it became one of my favorite comedies it is hilarious the jokes hit it is also scary at some points winners are chris hemsworths and kate mckinnons characters who are hilarious i recommend you see this movie
Jul 15 2016,negative,difficult to watch right from the start there is no sexism here this is a stinker can i get bridesmaids back
Jul 15 2016,positive,it attempts to recreate what the famous franchise invisioned but in a more comedic approach its doesnt deserve hate not love we should just admire the idea that someone wanted to recreate the movie in a comedic way with such funny actresses
Jul 15 2016,negative,wow seriously what a bunch of crap dont waste your money or time
Jul 15 2016,positive,paul feigs movies are always sort of a mess at least structurally i could be wrong but i assume the blame should be placed on improvisation hence why kate mckinnon despite being the best thing about this movie is never facing the same direction in any two shots and feels like a computer has randomly dropped a reaction shot of her into the first handful of scenes shes in you get used to it and its a pretty good excuse to see the film again which i will i liked it it borrows a bit too much from plot points in the original has maybe two too many cameos and there is that disjointed editing but the charm of the cast and the laughs that do land make it worthwhile    also this film serves as a mini other space reunion that show was created by feig had a short life on the now defunct yahoo screen and is probably feigs greatest accomplishment to this day i can only hope this pushes studio execs to consider a resurrection of the show if you havent seen it other space is still available on yahoo
Jul 15 2016,positive,it was so entertaining we laughed through the whole movie i liked it better than the original from my youth  i know some boys are mad they made it with women but really it is a funny movie
Jul 15 2016,positive,imax 3d so worth it screw the people who hated it it was a great and fun entertainment movie i loved the cast and the cameos will see it again
Jul 15 2016,positive,this movie was actually pretty good
Jul 15 2016,positive,the movie may have its issues but its also not as terrible as i was expecting it to be it is entertaining it is funny it certainly does not shit on the original the film works it works well i dont think it is better than the original in any way but its also not terrible i certainly will purchase the bluray when its available because it is of a good quality the kids loved it and soon started running around playing ghostbusters the same way i did as a child the kids have seen the originals and it did not have the same effect on them and honestly why are people having sooo many problems with thisnew ghostbusters because it is a beloved film from their childhood so thusly i believe that this has succeeded quite well because our kids will carry it on now along with the originals so you can have dads and daughters at halloween time playing spangler and holtzman cmon this is a great time to be alive folks this movie is not bad and it certainly does what a film should do and that is leave a lasting impression on the viewer
Jul 15 2016,negative,sad that ghostbusters was revived in this fashion it could have been something great maybe when they remake it again in 20 years we will get the version that the original deserves
Jul 15 2016,positive,if the original ghostbusters is a comedic symphony this remake is a catchy pop song maybe it wont be screened in film classes 30 years from now but its an entertaining summer flick with a topnotch cast
Jul 15 2016,positive,more please and thank you
Jul 15 2016,positive,this movie was far better than the ratings by viewers im usually right on par with the consensus but current standing is 44 from viewers i think people are reviewing it without watching it based on it being a female cast and a remake rather than a sequel go watch it and judge it for yourself they added some nice tie ins to the original film
Jul 15 2016,positive,if you are on the fence about going out and watching ghostbusters in the theater just go  this movie is hilarious had the right amount of nostalgic element with new these women did their thing  so happy they did a great job not only for the story but as good role models for my daughters celi was so excited to watch this movie and i believe it had to do with the fact she saw it was 4 lady ghostbusters girl power theme  all those sexist remarks when the story broke it was going to be an all girls gb can go suck it  i give this movie 45 slimmers out of a possibility of five
Jul 15 2016,negative,meh sums it up pretty well
Jul 15 2016,positive,i loved this movie  the cast is charming and funny it honours the original movie and is fun to watch i will definitely be buying the dvd
Jul 15 2016,positive,this film was all i could have ever hoped for and more i am so inspired right now going to make my own proton pack
Jul 15 2016,positive,a movie where the woman doesnt get rescued by a man they are top notch scientists and they are completely awesome this is he first female super gel movie
Jul 15 2016,positive,a worthy reboot of an 80s classicand a superb date movie too
Jul 15 2016,positive,i really likedspecially because if you like the original movies you can see some familiar faces
Jul 15 2016,negative,does this make me a sexist now granted the movie had a lot to live up to but i really went in there giving it a clean slate it had some funny moments more jump scares than funny the movie was bland overall in that you really didnt feel any sort of high stakes i can say it had cool graphics and good performances for the genre by the the 2 relatively unknown actresses i wont soon forget the movie not because it was memorable but because it will keep sparking debate over the overtly militant feminist messages im all for gender equality truly but they couldnt help themselves treat the men in the movie like men had treated women in the past 2 wrongs dont make a right this is the point where you confirm in your head im a sexist
Jul 15 2016,positive,i went in with really no expectations i liked the cast when i found out who was in it and they work togeather perfectly the movie gives you just the right amount of nostalgia all while they make it their own i cant wait to see this again go see it dont let the trolls win this movie is a perfect take on a childhood favorite
Jul 15 2016,positive,just not funny enough with such a wonderful cast this should have been muchmuch funnier  and the villain at the end was neither funny nor scary it was just odd i really wish it was better
Jul 15 2016,positive,so much better than the fanboys would like you to believe the trailers dont do it justice seriously boys put down the warcraft tell your mom its time to move on go wash up and rethink your choices here otherwise you will never feel the loving not to mention voluntary touch of another human being ever really if the original was a defining moment in your childhoodsue your parents for neglect because they sucked
Jul 15 2016,positive,this movie is just as good as the original ghostbusters i think most of the bad reviews come from people believing that things from their childhood were better most things always seem better when youre a kid though and things from your childhood seem better even if they werent   the best thing to do is to enjoy this type of movie for what it is not try to compare it to the original and just enjoy the show
Jul 15 2016,negative,this movie was bad very bad and it had nothing to do with the female cast the script was very bad it was filled with juvenile humor that wasnt even funny on even a lowbrow level the jokes that werent juvenile were just plain not funny i chuckled at perhaps three jokes the entire movie the plot was barely there the characters were simplistic and the special effects were drawn straight from the scoobydoo movies there were cameos and nods the films roots but those seemed forced and illexecuted i saw it in imax 3d and for the first time in a while i wish i had my 16 dollars back this reboot effort needs to die and the writers should never work in hollywood again again i dont blame the ladies for this not even the best actors in the world could have saved this turd blossom of a production from ruining my evening
Jul 15 2016,positive,this new ghostbusters was alright i didnt hate it i didnt love it i liked it i also thought the acting was great between the four leads and chris hemsworth 3 stars maybe better than ghostbusters ii
Jul 15 2016,positive,seriously the negative reviews from users are rooted in sexism plain and simple  the fan reverance for the original is way overstated its all a bunch of bros in their moms basement whining about women taking something from them  do yourself a favor go see this film  its a great time these women are all hilarious and the script from katie dippold and paul feig is fantastic
Jul 15 2016,positive,ghostbusters answer the call is a great movie but does not surpass the original ghostbusters it does have better comedy and more advanced ghost because of newer technology but still not better than the original i highly recommend this movie
Jul 15 2016,positive,actually pretty hilarious dont go in looking for 1984 set your expectations low this is not the same grounded suspension of disbelief film that the original was this is a goofy romp with some female gags sprinkled on top i was wrong in judging this prematurely you should give it a shot as well thanks to my friend who hooked my wife and i up to go see this
Jul 15 2016,positive,melissa mccarthy and her team did a fabulous job in this movieit made me laugh so hard once it comes to the experiment with the gadgets and the machines
Jul 15 2016,positive,i liked this movie  it was funny and lighthearted  it tapped into the core of the earlier movie while still doing its own thing  fun time to be had and worth the theater experience
Jul 15 2016,positive,it was a solid movie balancing original content and honoring the original the pacing was good the acting was extraordinary and the music was excellent as well hopefully this movie can rise beyond all the prerelease conflict and stand on its own merits
Jul 15 2016,positive,with dan ackroyd as executive producer i really dont understand haters of the remake giving this bad ratings for the hell of it you are insulting the very creator of the the original films you love this movie will never replace the original but it is an entertaining romp in its own right
Jul 15 2016,positive,i dont think it was that bad or even really overbearing with any messages im still not happy with how the marketing turned though
Jul 15 2016,positive,saw it in 3d imax and loved it
Jul 15 2016,negative,nothing close to a great film some slight humor but nothing great somewhat male bashing if roles were reversed it would be deemed sexist and racial original blows this one away
Jul 15 2016,negative,this had to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen both the wife and i hated it and thought it stunk
Jul 15 2016,positive,what a fantastic movie i loved every second of it i was one of the few people who were hyped for this movie to come out i saw this on july 15 2016 i liked the cameos specifically the dan cameo i thought the stand out actor of the movie was leslie jones i thought the other 3 women were also to but leslie sold the show chris was great to the slimer cameo was clever and the ghosts looked amazing plus the movie even got me with a jump scare i preordered this movie not as good as the original but close 55
Jul 15 2016,positive,very entertaining and funny found that it held its own
Jul 15 2016,positive,summary this is not the best comedy ive ever seen but its decent i  dont regret spending the money on it and would consider watching a  sequel this is not an intellectual or cinematic masterpiece its  goofy and knows it dont expect an immersive drama and youll be fine    pros     good initial setup     holtzman one of the main characters is fantastic     decent humor sprinkled throughout the movie     kevin the receptionist is brilliantly executed    cons     the character patty is something of a racial stereotype     individual characters are relatively uninteresting for those moments  where the movie tries to be anything other than a comedy     a couple of the jokes are puerile rather than funny     special effects are okay but not amazing though i didnt much care    a note there seem to be a lot of reviews with complaints about sexual  discrimination against men in this movie there really isnt any to  speak of    one comic relief character is a moron the government officials are  inept and the heroes turn out to have been right all along i have no  idea why anyone would expect anything else from a movie advertised to  be light on plot and heavy on humor there is a single joke with any  hint of sexist hostility throughout the movie and its a oneliner in  the movies epilogue as for the four ghostbusters being women that  should on balance happen in one out of every 16 movies featuring four  main characters if anything it needs to happen more often weve got  some catching up to do    also it doesnt matter but ill mention it here for anyone who thinks  it does this reviews author sports his fair share of y chromosomes
Jul 15 2016,negative,where is the magic maybe the extended version is better maybe   
Jul 15 2016,negative,i wanted to see the movie with a lot of people so i went opening friday with the family  while there was a mixed bunch of laughter i found the movie incredibly boring  the dialogue was terrible  the plot was nonexistent  the villian had no motivation  i wasnt dissappointed because my expectations were pretty low to begin with      the humor was a huge departure from the original  quite a few poopcrotch jokes and shots at the perceived misogynist nerds  i felt like the cast has talent but couldnt do much with what was given  the design of the ghosts was a little mixed  i thought the prisoner ghost and the ghosts in rowans lair were pretty good  i didnt like the design of rowan but the cg was well done  he looked like a fat man wearing pajamas    the way the film was shot was terrible  flat lighting kept the mood from getting scary also they didnt shoot in new york and it showed  they should have just set the movie in boston because it felt very different from new york
Jul 15 2016,negative,its ok but the 73 critical review is way too high  i give it a 60 the original gets a 90
Jul 15 2016,positive,dont listen to the trolls this movie was great
Jul 15 2016,positive,classic for those who of a generous of good classic films this does just that
Jul 15 2016,positive,wonderful take on a remake it was refreshing to see melissa mccarthy and kristing wiig be smart funny rather then purely bridesmaids funny i went in skeptical and came out excited to see it again as a lover of the original movies i was glad to see they used parts of dan akroyds potential 3 script but they made something original i hope to see a sequel i will always love the originals but i loved to see some bad ass funny girls carry such a wonderful film
Jul 15 2016,negative,can i have a refund
Jul 15 2016,positive,while its gags may be hit  miss and dependant heavily on shortstint cameos and nostalgia of the original the reboot blasts enough for a likeable summer blockbuster ghostbusters new generation take is obviously a visual treat and spectacle led by the starstudded femaledriven squad though not as impressive as the 1984 version its still fairly entertaining 355
Jul 15 2016,negative,couple of funny moments here and  there but its not really a good moviethis is something that you should wait till u see it on dvd
Jul 15 2016,negative,one of the worst movies ever made
Jul 15 2016,positive,i loved it  what a great movie  it was hilarious and i loved the all female cast  better yet  it is a great example of real women  i am going to see it again
Jul 15 2016,neutral,there is the occasional laugh here or there but overall is just not that good
Jul 15 2016,positive,never listen to the negativity of people who judge a movie before it comes out its common sense
Jul 15 2016,negative,this is the most disgusting cashgrab ive ever seen   forget the plot  the adventure the discovery  the jokes or any well written characters  it is not there     i went with myy 2 kids  hoping we could spend some quality time as mother and childrenit just ended up in the most revolting  akward and ditastful moment ive ever lived in a moie theatre    i was shocked by the constant misandry and racism in this movie  and i am a fucking mother   even my daughter of 7 yo was asking me  why are they so mean to the men  why are they so stupid these women are so dumb and boring  a 7 years old girl can see how disgusting this movie was toward men     ho my god  when they said  it was all men are sexist for not liking the trailer they are antifeminist  i was like maybe it is partly truebut no   i am litteraly furious   furious for beeing used by feminist to push their agenda into movies like this  furious for beeing toyed by the media to force me to look at this shit because im a woman and if i dont see it im an horrible woman and should be ashamed of it    no  never in my life iv witnessed such horrible  distastful and shameful movie    do not listen the critics  they are clearly either paid or idiots dont give your movie to this garbage you could take a broom in the ass  that would still be more fun than this 
Jul 15 2016,positive,really enjoyed the movie
Jul 15 2016,positive,a summer surprise loads of laughs and supernatural action the movie actually has some more creepy creeps but then the original but still lends itself to full blown comedy there were a few moments at the start that the humor didnt go thw way i would like but once leslie jones showed up the story got focused and became a cartoon dream of action comedy kate mckinnon stole the show with her over the top holtzmann and chris hemsworth shows off some fantastic comedic chops this film was the surprise of the summer because being a reboot i wasnt expecting to actually fully enjoy it to the point of excited to see it again also the end scene teases whats to come for the new ghostbusters i am a huge fan of the original and this will never replace that it just adds to the rich history of the busters
Jul 15 2016,neutral,255 stars the overall critic and audience reception to this is spot on  it cannot compare in any way shape or form to the legendary status of the original film at the same time its not as bad as people are probably expecting it to be if i could sum it up with one word it would be harmless this film is harmless
Jul 15 2016,negative,omg refund director screwed this movie up so bad 
Jul 15 2016,positive,it was great i cant wait for number 2 coming out they did a great job making the movie
Jul 15 2016,negative,wasnt terriblejust kinda meh
Jul 15 2016,negative,dont believe the botsthis movie  s u c k s    pay at your perilyou have been warned
Jul 15 2016,positive,dear angry 80s fan boys you are wrong ghostbusters is awesome  ha ha ha ha ha just watched it today i laughed throughout the scary parts are good great nods to the original  dont be a political tool and go watch it for yourself
Jul 15 2016,positive,really funny and great action sequences the movies standout cast is truly incredible
Jul 15 2016,positive,wasnt as bad as i expected but also wasnt as good as it could have been the trailers made it look way worse than it was i really liked the first 75 of the movie but the last 25 was pretty bad maybe because i went into the theater expecting the worst i was able to come out somewhat satisfied the acting was ok the story was ok not that great they for sure plan on making a franchise out of this you can tell because they created an entire department for the movie at least it had a logo at the start something like ghostbusters studios and they referenced zuul at the end of the movie after the credits go see this if you are bored or maybe high if you worshiped the first two you may find it somewhat blasphemous but also somewhat satisfying
Jul 15 2016,negative,i was so excited for this movie release but i was bitterly disappointed  it was boring  even the special effects werent all that special  i kept looking for anything to like about it and outside of the cameos from the old cast i found nothing  so sad
Jul 15 2016,positive,awesome stand alone film  ghostbusters 20  kate mckinnon  leslie jones were stand out stars as expected great spectacle amazing effects and ghosts  overall a huge success in my book  see it in 3d there are a few jump scares that are worth getting the full effect must see  must own
Jul 15 2016,positive,i loved this movie  the cast was great the story was interesting and it was different from the original  i loved the cameos and thor was hilarious i was in tears during his interview scene  the action was welldone and the effects were great
Jul 15 2016,positive,it was a fun and fresh take on the ghostbusters we knew and love it was clear feige and the crew love the original just as much as the fans  while this movie is not as great as the original it does it honor and its way better than the original sequel
Jul 15 2016,negative,its entertaining summer fare but not much more and frankly that isnt enough for this franchise
Jul 15 2016,positive,its hard to beat the 97 of the original but i loved this fresh take on ghostbusters im a huge fan of both the originals but to be fair this def stands on its own basis as just a goodfun and funny film kristen and melissa def deliver and its packed full of some surprised guests which made everyone in my theater excited loved it and not sure why the rating is so low from the users stop comparing everything to the originals clearly remakes are going to happen wether we want them or not so open your pallet and enjoy
Jul 15 2016,positive,just saw the new ghostbusters and i thought it was entertaining its strong points are definitely the comedy and huge variety of interesting ghosts not really sure why everyone was dogging this movie right out of the gate the negative views of this movie are just not warranted
Jul 15 2016,positive,so much fun  entertaining goofy funny and loved the cameos my kids loved it and now they want to see the original
Jul 15 2016,negative,abysmal special effects look like their retreads from haunted mansion the cameos are forced the jokes are so old  outdated this movie is terrible
Jul 15 2016,negative,oh dear i wish i could get my money back and my ticket was free this could have had a chance if melissa mccarthy wasnt cast in this stop letting her make movies this is shameful
Jul 15 2016,positive,was laugh out loud funny they did an excellent job i was a huge fan of the original and this did not disappoint i love melissa mccarthy and she was amazing as always loved the rest of the cast as well super fun to see the cameos wait till the very end of the credits for added surprise
Jul 15 2016,positive,loved the original and loved this one the ladies are just as funny as the gents maybe even a little more
Jul 15 2016,negative,the opening joke is a queef and its all downhill from there anyone who says haters are sexist are covering for a sexist and unfunny movie its projection on the part of sony and the director do not pay money to see it
Jul 15 2016,positive,i wished they kept the history of the original gb intact and continued the legacy from a story perspective i had bias going in but in the end we enjoyed it and look forward to sequels
Jul 15 2016,positive,loved it great visuals and very funny if at times a bit overly sentimental
Jul 15 2016,positive,i like it way more than i thought i would everyone is dogging on it but really its just a fun summer movie for a new generation a more open minded movie
Jul 15 2016,positive,way better than expected great punchlines and comedy great casting best thing the commercials didnt give all the funny parts away great watch
Jul 15 2016,negative,harmless movie geared more towards kids
Jul 15 2016,positive,this movie was so good and i believe that it deserves more credit then what its getting there were some very good jumpscares clever references to the old ghostbuster movies and amazing action scenes along with great acting
Jul 15 2016,positive,great reboot as a superman of the original i realized we would never get a ghostbusters 3 they passed the torch onto the girls to make a different style movie with the franchisee the did a great job putting all the old cast and characters in the movie was fantastic
Jul 15 2016,positive,nick and i loved the new ghostbusters movie so funny and the ghosts were awesome

Jul 15 2016,positive,that was awesome  full of cameos 
Jul 15 2016,positive,im not sure if people saw the same movie  it had a couple flat moments but it also was sooo funny  kate mckinnon shines but chris hemsworth steals the show  who knew he had such comedic abilities  dont go see it to compare it to the originalthis movie stands well on its own  we saw it in imaxand i think the larger format really made a difference  
Jul 15 2016,positive,not bad id give the orginal a 445  not sure everyone was the best for their roll but enjoyed it
Jul 15 2016,positive,really good movie they stayed true to the original while still making it current
Jul 15 2016,positive,loved this movie i laughed all the way through
Jul 15 2016,negative,a total joke to the ghostbusters license terrible on every account
Jul 15 2016,negative,so before i begin and delve into spoilery territory ill save you the read its a 410     still here okay lets begin with a short history of this films development since im sure some of you are asking yourselves why is this a rebootremake and not sequel the ghostbusters 3 script titled ghostbusters alive again was being shown to different directors by amy pascal ceo of sony at the time nobody wanted to touch it because the people they went to are huge fans of the originals and didnt want to ruin it noble but that in turn lead to the inevitable a remake amy pascal is a huge fan of paul feig mainly because he places women in lead comedy roles hes directed bridesmaids and the spy he turned down the script and came back to amy with a pitch to start from scratch because he couldnt wrap his head around doing a sequel in a world where ghosts already exist     my personal opinion if a film director cant conceive creatively of a world where the paranormal already exist some say we already do for a famous classic film franchise then he shouldnt be allowed near it in the first place the original film was created by close friends they conceived the entire universe of ghostbusters thats something you just dont go cherry picking because you want to send a message ill get to that later anyways amy pascal got excited and greenlit the project without ivan reitman original director and dan aykroyds permission all hell broke loose behind closed doors lawyers and angry emails were exchanged  then enter ghost corps its a separate piece of sony studio that is in charge of anything ghostbusters related thats now run by  ivan and dan sort of a peace offering the studio made to them kinda like what disney is to marvel films but the damage had been done and the project was on the fast track to being in production    by this time the story had been leaked to the media and the internet imploded as im sure most of you know they made it very loud and clear that they didnt want a remake of a classic film the negativity was so huge that sonys marketing team started deleting every comment on the articles and leaving the sexist insults they did the same when the trailer was rolled out back in may trust me when i say nobody cared that it starred all women they only cared that the movie was being remade     there lets get to the movie  the opening sequence was fun and jumpy this time instead of an elderly female librarian we get a snarky tour host of a historical mansion you know the beat if youve seen the original character gets scared tries to run away ghost appears before them and kick in the ghostbusters theme oh by the way the original gb theme by ray parker jr is only used for this sequence and it lasts for 67 seconds and its the version he rerecorded for the video game back in 2009 so its not even the original original thats being nitpicky so lets move on      this film lands maybe 9 laughs some of the jokes draaaagone scene in particular in the mayors office about putting the cat back in the box is an eye roller the characters themselves are bland aside from kate mckinnon her eccentric personality brought her character flavor i remember when the first trailer was released that a lot of people hated leslie joness character mainly because it was plainly obvious it was playing off of the streetsavvy stereotype there was an attempt at damage control by marketing and by the crew claiming she is a new york city historian ummno she is not shes a subway clerk she is loud obnoxious and plays off like a watered down chris rock from the 90s     after the ghostbusters get their first call to a concert and bust the ghost the crowd after the starts chanting ghostbusters when the ladies just got their name prior to them arriving in the original they earned the chant after becoming famous and when the end of the world was about to happen before entering the building in this it seemed very forced     did i mention they try to make fun of internet trolls and comments yeah they have those in there  the ladies post video evidence of ghosts on youtube and they read off the comments to the audience why just ignore the negativity and do your thing dont try and troll back which is what most of this movie does tries to troll back at the people that didnt want this made while accusing the production of pushing a feminism agenda and its cringeworthy heres a short list    referencing internet comment sections  referencing remaking something nobody wanted  main ghost baddie gets blasted in the balls yes a ghost has balls apparently oh and the main baddie starts off as human thats an antisocial basement dweller  slimer cameos and he now has a sheslimer complete with blonde wig and purple bow    im sure i missed a few but those should be enough to get my point across aside from all of that the editing was a mess you could tell paul feig cut this thing at least 30 times it reminded me of the ninja turtles movie from a few years ago that also went through recuts and reshoots  nothing really blended well together remember how in the original film they were a business and ghostbusted to make money thats gone here theyre reduced to a secret government operation by the end of the film like the men in black which correct me if im wrong kind of defeats the purpose of the who ya gonna call tagline theres no need for them to have a secretary by the way that part is played by chris hemsworth hes an idiot blonde bimbo which brings me to my next point if your a director trying to get more lead roles for women in hollywood make things equal dont make men idiots assholes perverts or all of the above in your female lead films its not cute its not funny and hate only creates more hate     in short its an antimale sloppy edited unorganized shitty reboot dont want it compared to the original classic then dont call it ghostbusters
Jul 15 2016,positive,likes it more than the original
Jul 15 2016,negative,lets get this out of the way right off the jump the new ghostbusters is not very good and that may be the most dangerous opinion ive ever had about a movie  at this point it seems completely impossible to have an intelligent discussion about the film due to the controversy it has generated director paul feigs decision to go with an allfemale team this time around was polarizing immediately causing backlash from fans of the original films it was also a decision ripe for internet trolling thanks to a brigade of idiotic mouthbreathing women haters spewing their misogynistic crap opinions all over twitter and youtube ghostbusters 2016 has become the focal point for an online political war over the status of women in film comedy and society  yes the ghostbusters  since the first trailer for ghostbusters arrived and almost instantly became the mostdisliked video in the history of youtube two distinct camps have emerged on the battlefield first there are a large group of people who have simply decided to hate this movie and everyone involved with it at all costs some members of this group feel its disrespectful of the original and want nothing to do with a rebootremake of this classic memory of their childhoods others however are flatout haters of women its either thinly veiled or in your face but these fine folks are miserable people of the highest order struggling to maintain the perceived status quo and their male privilege they are empty and miserable they are the husks of society but they are loud and they are many  next we have a group of people who are tired of seeing women harassed belittled or treated as anything less than equals in film or anywhere else the trolls did a fine job of pissing these people off since many of the comments posted about the film to date are caustic dismissively misogynistic and frankly quite horrible this camp has picked a wonderful hill to defend from   the effective result is that it is extremely difficult to have a public opinion about the new ghostbusters that is anything other than positive there were valid complaints to be made about the tone of the trailers and the direction the film looked to be heading but they were drowned out by angry people reasoning that if you have anything negative to say about the movie you must hate women   this is an amazing shield to stand behind immediately all negative criticism is rendered moot not only that but it means many people have to say something publicly positive as both staying silent or voicing reasonable criticism has the same effect  disgust and dismissal and cries of misogyny   this is a very tough spot to be in  and i think thats been reflected so far in the early reviews as i write this the movie premieres nationwide tomorrow major critics writing last week were overly positive about it and i think that has largely to do with how some of the earlier opinionated few were absolutely destroyed for their negative thoughts the defenders who came out to spew their garbage thoughts at the critical were just as bad if not worse than the original trolls deriding the trailer delving into some of the worst personal attacks ive ever read   who wants to be involved with that to turn that horrible glowing internet eye upon yourself its both easier and more righteous to defend the movie and the actresses and an awful lot of people wrote words to that effect last week there were also rumors going around that sony bought and paid for many of those reviews gamergatestyle  i dont know about that what i do know was how the studio represented itself at my screening and i think its valid to discuss here   first of all there were honesttogod plants in the audience shills if you will a troop of ghostbusters cosplayers were given the entire row behind us we had seen them milling about earlier dressed up in jumpsuits with all the bells and whistles proton packs pke meters traps goggles the works they thought they were here for a presentation of some kind maybe they were going to be introduced they would do a little dance i dont know what actually happened was they were stripped of all their gear at the theater entrance and herded directly into their seats i overheard some of them talking in the bathroom and they were clearly confused three hours getting ready for this was the exact statement sorry guys but you arent here to show off you were very clearly brought here to be the guaranteed group to laugh and applaud  next we got a little speech from a long haired studio guy dressed in all denim for some reason we were told we were the lucky few as they had to turn away 300 people at the door now i have been to many a press screening for many a movie and its the first time ive ever heard of this happening these screenings are usually well planned and well executed with exactly the right amount of tickets given out to fill the space did they give out extra so they could pick and choose among those who showed looking for people who would give the most enthusiastic reaction i dont know but i will say ive never had that thought at a screening before  next he mentioned the cosplayers noting loudly that they were split mostly 5050 between men and women and thanking them for their support he finished up by stating be sure to let us know what you thought about the move when its over he paused looking around disdainfully except for the haters we dont want to hear that he sat down to riotous applause from the part of the crowd that wasnt press  people you need to understand this is a problem  whatever bubble studioguy is living in it will not help this movie the equivalent of putting your fingers in your ears and shouting la la la i cant hear you will not help this movie screaming your idiot head off about women taking over mens roles will not help this movie and ignoring relevant criticism due to preconceived decisions about where those critics thoughts are coming from will not help this movie  all of this puts me in a unique position i think i am for lack of a better word free i have never met or spoken to anyone at sony much less received a dollar from them i have no connections to those who worked on or acted in this movie i dont have to worry about their feelings when we run into each other at a party or whole foods i also do not have to worry about the allseeing eye of the internet turning upon me if i had 300 death threat posts on my twitter tomorrow i wouldnt even know maybe in a month when i look at it the same goes for the very website youre reading this on i dont work for variety or the washington post i wont cost us readers or upset any industry contacts by voicing my true opinion were popular enough these words will reach people but compared to an article in the new york times writing this is still very close to operating in a void   i would also add that its my belief there is nothing more subjective than ones enjoyment of a film however to actually have an opinion means seeing the actual film there are many complainers whove decided not to see it and that may be the stupidest thing they could have done that decision completely invalidates any of their further thoughts on the movie its important that anyone and everyone feel safe and comfortable expressing their opinions but not seeing it gives a person no valid opinion at all youre just making shit up now  so that was a lot of exposition to explain why im happy to say truthfully and fearlessly that ghostbusters is not very good it is also not as bad as all the haters want it to be it exists somewhere in between like most terrible bigbudget summer movies if i was an 8yearold girl i would think this was the best movie ever it is loud and stupid and colorful and exists in a world where no one is ever really in danger and there are no consequences its a great film to take your kids to and i hope its admired and loved by every little girl who needs a strong female nerd hero to emulate on those merits alone it should do very well at the box office and spawn a sequel  the end if thats what you came here for please leave with the knowledge that this is a solid garbage summer movie like most garbage summer movies go in peace and never think about this again  but if youre still reading its either out of morbid curiosity for how big a hole i may dig here or you would like an honest nonbiased critical opinion of the film from at least one person i hope to deliver  if you simply view this as a standalone comedy with no history preceding it it doesnt succeed very well the script is well pretty stupid it certainly doesnt do the four talented actresses starring in the main roles any favors im sure the pg13 rating didnt help but the ladies are not very funny in this not all the jokes fall flat but they fail more than they succeed kate mckinnon is amusingly crazy and wacky throughout and leslie jones has a few good lines but thats basically it kristen wiig and melissa mccarthy are serviceable but uninspired and boring and i dont think it has anything to do with the actresses whatsoever while watching the film i thought about replacing the ladies with the rumored male reboot cast of seth rogen james franco jonah hill and craig robinson and wondered if it would be any better  it would not  i think to myself is it the director at points it does seem like he went to the kevin smith school of all medium shots all the time or maybe its sonys fault they need a franchise to be successful so very badly their marketing department and those godawful trailers were certainly a misstep there were also rumors during shooting that they were interfering and meddling with production while simultaneously bullying and angering their stars do we lay the blame there  the dialogue suffers there are at least several cringeinducing moments where the stars visibly struggle through their lines the villain is uninspired and easy to forget with no real motivation other than being the bad guy all of the cgi looks terrible and is vastly overused the film comes to a crescendo on the worst greenscreen times square ive ever seen and ends with i swear to god a shotforshot remake of the climax of big hero 6   the whole thing is made bearable by the presence of chris hemsworth as the busters bumbling stupid receptionist he has all the best jokes and like mckinnon appears to be having a good time hes even the standin for the bodyjumping ghost villain through the third act to maximize his time on screen i would guess it seems kind of sad that the best part of a movie so entrenched in announcing its femaleness would be the lone dude but there you have it  if you are a fan of the original movies this ghostbusters is going to piss you off the movie does not stand by itself in reverence of the films that came before but charting its own path instead feig and the scriptwriters choose to do everything they can to remind the viewer of the previous movies down to using the same lines of dialogue the references are everywhere in this bizarre mix of reboot and remake they even have cameos from all of the major actors from the first movie who are strangely not playing their characters but instead random people in the universe the new team manages to kill a nonbeliever played by bill murray dan aykroyd drives by in a cab at one point and says i aint afraid of no ghost     yes these things happen  nothing you like about the original movie is on display here the two films arent even similar if the original is groucho marx the reboot is straight three stooges bill murray vs chevy chase to put it another way  the easiest comparison to make here is this its like a very bad adam sandler movie or a long snl skit gone wrong its full of dumb jokes that because there are girls must now be girl jokes the initial meeting of the new team shows them bonding over a tape of mckinnon queefing for example and so on not to say all the jokes are terrible again there are moments of chuckling throughout but also many more times where i just felt embarrassed for the participants  what else to say the plot is thin the science nonsensical the jokes are dumb and the ending is awful throw in the horrible cgi and it starts to sound like im talking about another sony summer movie that was equally terrible however no one was accused of misogyny for saying they didnt like mystique  thats what i thought go forth now gentle reader see the movie and create your own opinion and dont let sony the misogynists the defenders or anyone tell you youre wrong for loving it or hating it   ill end with this  at one point towards the end of the movie i heard a single loud outofcontext ha barked out behind me i turned my head to see it was one of the cosplayers a fixed grin plastered on his face clearly he had malfunctioned as no one else had made any sound at all i looked at him for a few more moments but his eyes never met mine he just continued to stare straight ahead at the screen waiting for the next moment he would be told to laugh
Jul 15 2016,positive,pretty good movie i laughed quite a bit enjoyed the action and characters and the effects were pretty good solid 7 out of 10
Jul 15 2016,positive,while the internet said that this movie would be a flop months before its release what we got was an energized re invigoration of the beloved franchise sure there were a few complaints but nowhere near enough for this to be a bad movie
Jul 15 2016,positive,pretty good movie the girls did agood job with their roles i wasnt expecting to like it as much as i did
Jul 15 2016,positive,solid summer film there were several parts that were just so wonderfully funny the kind of funny where you initially chuckle and then laugh for real a couple seconds later i was really worried that patty was going to be a stereotype she was awesome there was really only a couple things that bugged me usually i like nods to previous movies this one just had a couple too many but that wasnt a big deal the finale feels a bit rushed theres a music video in the credits that you kind of wish was part of the movie   overall i dont get the hate it was silly wonderfully silly which is what i liked about the first one spouse and i were repeating the lines the whole way home and laughing all over again i would trust the critics score more than the audience score as i cannot believe that i saw the same movie that those haters saw the movie i saw wasnt no grapes of wrath but i dont think it was supposed to be   safety lights are for dudes lol
Jul 15 2016,negative,this was so obviously a cash grab and doesnt deserve the publicity
Jul 15 2016,positive,i really enjoyed this movie there are some really great stunts action comedy and nods to the previous ghostbusters some of the technical talk flew past me but all in all i really enjoyed it
Jul 15 2016,positive,amazing moviehonestly really surprised go watch it
Jul 15 2016,positive,hilarious wiig jones mccarthy and mckinnon worked well together and hemsworth was a jewel
Jul 15 2016,positive,other folk are crazy this movie was hilarious
Jul 15 2016,negative,this film was an utter travesty that spits in the face of everything the original stood for feige is a hack that thinks slapstick cliche boring overdone humor is okay if you slap women into the role and call it progressive
Jul 15 2016,positive,movie did not disappoint refreshing new spin good humor great acting cameo appearances and lots of 80s references 3d graphics were out of this world
Jul 15 2016,positive,i had lots of fun watching this movie many hilarious laugh out loud moments if you can watch it in 3d because the ghosts look pretty cool
Jul 15 2016,neutral,if this movie was 9 parts id say parts 1 2 3 4 8 9 was scary and funny i could have done without parts 5 6 7i thought mckinnon jones and hemsworth stole the showi thought wiig was there for a paychecki think im done with wiig and mccarthy i dint care for themat least mccarthy triedwiig really disappointed me simply because she used to be a favorite of mine
Jul 15 2016,negative,an abomination of a film
Jul 15 2016,negative,just plain awful  1st off there was no need to remake this movie the original is still relevant and a thousand times better but secondly if you are going to do so at least make an effort  not one laugh out loud or anything memorable at all about this movie just a waste of 2 hours of your life youll never get back it is however a good iq test if you like it you know you are a complete moron
Jul 15 2016,positive,fun summer film  its not the original and it doesnt really try to be   the trailer should go down in history of what not to do when dealing with such a well known property  the trailer lacked so much context which is why it failed the movie settles a lot of the confusion the trailer brought  the cast all played their parts well kate mckinnon is about to be a household name  leslie jones suffered the most from the trailer she was such a strong and confident character with more smarts than most leslie deserves many props as well
Jul 15 2016,positive,so many laughs and nostalgia absolutely loved it
Jul 15 2016,positive,i thought it was great action comedy drama  loved the cameos of original ghostbusters but it definitely can stand on its own
Jul 15 2016,positive,i had tears in my eyes from laughing so hard loved it and the cameos from the original movies
Jul 15 2016,positive,very entertaining fun reinvention of the ghostbusters franchise i was skeptical but came away impressed kate mckinnon  chris hemsworth are particularly funny although the whole cast has moments plenty of nods to the original but theyre not too distracting i hope they make another itll certainly be better than the original ghostbusters 2
Jul 15 2016,positive,it wasnt nearly as bad as the trailers made it out to be still it wasnt great by any stretch i enjoyed mckinnons quirky role and didnt hate mccarthys character as much as usual and while some of the cameos worked really well i disliked bill murrays cameo immensely it wasnt funny and added nothing
Jul 15 2016,positive,ive always loved the original and this version is just as good  dont let the haters stop you from going to this great movie
Jul 15 2016,positive,im a 32 year old ghostbusters super fan ive seen the original so many time i know every line by heart i saw gb2 in theaters when i was in preschool i grew up on all the cartoons and the first time i went to nyc in high school i begged my dad to take us to all the filming locations and we did ive played every gb game including the table top rpg i even remade marathon infinity into a ghostbusters first person shooter when i was 16 ive been interacting with the gb online community since the community hub ended in emkowbill super fan  so i was pretty sad whenever the internet started reporting rumors that the movie was terrible and the trailer was horrible when i saw the trailer i wasnt wowd but i kept an open mind  i just got back from the theater from seeing the new film i really liked it it was laugh out loud funny throughout the film there were tense and even somewhat scary parts there was a good dynamic between the actresses the effects looked good and the plot was fresh while still having some solid nods to the old school the plot felt a little rushed to the final encounter but it pretty much felt like the kind of movies that come out in 2016 aka avengers deadpool etc it was a funny character sketch action movie  i thought it was worth my time and money and it was worthy to continue the ghostbusters culture and i think it sucks that its gotten such bad hype i think the bad hype is what is gonna make the movie do bad in theaters it holds its own if you are the fence about going just go haters and trolls always have something bad to say
Jul 15 2016,positive,it was a great movie couple of jokes here and there but the rest of the film was entertaining the women cast worked pretty well as the new ghostbusters however the script and the joke could have been better it had nothing to do with the cast imo the flaw on some jokes was the fault of the writer the actresses did a great job on their part  the after credit scene was really cool and funny to watch that was a good idea    i really enjoyed the film and hater are going to hate no matter what
Jul 15 2016,negative,wow if could give it zero stars i would
Jul 15 2016,negative,dont waste your money
Jul 15 2016,negative,booring    did not recapture the magic of the first or second uninspired casting  i found myself much more interested in my popcorn and easedropping on others that were board
Jul 15 2016,positive,i liked it and if i say anymore i will be hated by everyone else on the internet so all im going to say is i enjoyed the movie and you should see it for yourself
Jul 15 2016,positive,great movie dont let the few sour people out there ruin it
Jul 15 2016,negative,ughhh exactly what youd expect  they attempted to do a remake fail and ended up just making a consistently cringeworthy series of jokes  the entire premise from start to finish was unimaginative and the villain was just garbage  basically they tried to pander to feminists and ended up ostracizing everyone who doesnt feel perpetually oppressed
Jul 15 2016,negative,the humor was set with the first fart joke this is the type of humor for five year old girls not to mention the leading male is nothing but mentally challenged eye candy so im going to throw in sexist as well
Jul 15 2016,positive,this movie is pure fun     it works as a standalone but also has enough references to and cameos from the original films to keep us old codgers amused i wasnt expecting much when i sent to see it  maybe something more or less on par with ghostbusters 2  but this was much more witty and much more fun the writing was great the acting was solid the chemistry between the characters was excellent sure the story was a bit hokey  but no more so than the original movies    all in all  a worthy successor to the originals im not a huge fan of this genre but i had an absolute blast with this movie
Jul 15 2016,positive,definitely worth the watch it is a lot better than everyone is making out to be its witty funny and a good sequel one reason why this movie has a great critic score and a low user is because there is a group of people who didnt like that it was a all female cast anyways great movie worth a watch
Jul 15 2016,positive,dont listen to the whiners and haters  this movie stands on its own and is funny and entertaining  the next generation of ghost busters is here to stay
Jul 15 2016,positive,great quit bitching
Jul 15 2016,negative,this movies is total misandrystic garbage racial negative cliché stereotypes and insulting humor this movie should had never been made
Jul 15 2016,negative,oh my goodness this movie sucked it doesnt matter if its all female or not just tell it like it is  its not funny which is kinda important for a comedy for those of you inflating your reviews just to be politically correct youre a bunch of pansies
Jul 15 2016,negative,i was way more excited than what i saw  ugh
Jul 15 2016,positive,this didnt come out nearly as bad as i thought
Jul 15 2016,negative,very few laughs here dont waste your money  if you must see it wait for the dvd and fast forward it to the end the only redeeming quality is that chris hemsworth dances at the end
Jul 15 2016,positive,loved this movie it was funny and fun had a great time
Jul 15 2016,negative,ive been a huge ghostbusters fan since i was 10 ive made ghostbusters fan film in my adulthood my wife and i even own a classic cadillac ecto1 we take to car shows and parades so to be honest when i heard they were rebooting ghostbusters i wasnt happy to hear that they were starting over the franchise i grew up on especially since the original characters and history have been respected and expanded upon so well by idw comics and the 2009 video game i felt it wasnt broken so why try to fix it i did however want to see female busters who were every bit as competent as their male counterparts in any new movie when i went to see it i kept an open mind and tried to watch it as its own movie my one word review of this film is meh    the good stuff this cast kristen wiig and melissa mccarthy worked well together leslie jones rocked after the trailers dropped and showed the power of patty and an almost literal slapstick gag involving her i was afraid her character was going to be too over the top for my tastes but she wasnt and ended up being one of my favorite characters the action and effects were pretty good in the third act it is a bit more kid friendlier than the original and i love that its getting a fan base of young girls the original is what sparked my interest in science and i hope this one does that for its young female fans unfortunately thats about all i can remember that i thought was good    the bad stuff the comedy didnt work for me it felt forced and so cheesy every single character in the movie was doing a bit or a joke every single one there were no straight characters for the comedic characters to play off of or have a realistic reaction to something outlandish the villain was lame his motivations were kind of weak and never made the stakes feel all that high kate mckinnon was a bit too wacky at times i started out liking her but grew tired of her by the end chris hemsworths character was unrealistically stupid he was supposed to be the comic relief but in a movie where nothing is grounded or taken seriously at all a comic relief character is pretty pointless everything felt rushed which is weird since the director had said he wanted it to be more of a slow burn i had no sense of how much time had passed between scenes which felt odd the plot is messy and a bit incoherent the nods to the original were distracting as much as i love the original this movie couldve been better if it didnt rely so heavily on fan service the movie spent a lot of time on long jokes that did nothing to add to the story and keep it moving like mccarthy arguing with a delivery man about her chinese food order or leslie jones arguing with a graffiti artist in the subway or the busters arguing with a cop who doesnt believe something that happened was due to a ghostand what happened was something pretty serious that shouldve warranted that cop at least taking them in for questioning about a possible crime but instead leads to a pretty contrived argument about patrick swayze movies    my opinion this movie was better than i was afraid it might be but thats not what i want to say when i walk out of the theater thats what many reviews of this film are saying too i feel like the hate this movie was getting before anyone ever saw it helped it in an odd way it set expectations way low so after people see it theyre saying it wasnt as bad as the feared if there was never any controversy leading up to it and people werent trying to shake off the youtube comment funk in order to watch it with an open mind i think it would get worse reviews and lower ratings than it has been getting thus far    it couldve been a better movie if it was allowed to stand on its own but its nearly impossible to not compare it to the original because its an established property thats unavoidable to me paul feig was the wrong fit for this franchise the original had clever jokes and writing funny characters that still felt grounded and a great balance of scares and laughs without resorting to corny shtick feigs style is more crude over the top wacky humor i mean he had planned  and filmed  a dance sequence for this movie that was cut that worried me    in short i feel this movie is getting a bit of a phantom menace effect i wouldnt be surprised if the people who like it now are just riding a bit of a high after seeing the first new ghostbusters film in a theater in decades but after some time passes and repeat viewings happen they might change their minds and think it was disappointing after all
Jul 15 2016,positive,obviously not perfect some of the jokes fall flat overall a wonderful hilarious romp through a ghostinfested new york city
Jul 15 2016,positive,if you can resist comparing it to the original the new ghostbusters is quite enjoyable it is another hit for feig and co and the casting could not have been more perfect mccarthy and wiig are the coleads and play their respective parts well but mckinnon and jones are the real standouts they deliver the most laughs despite less screen time the cameos and references to the original are plentiful but not overbearing ghostbusters is the hilarious movie that this summer lineup has sorely been lacking right now
Jul 15 2016,negative,sony really trying to turn away the attention of its mediocre anticlimactic poorly paced movie towards the small percentage of trolls saying its cause of the all women cast no one really cares if it was an all women cast we just wanted a good movie i love kristen wig and kate mckinnon melissa mccarthy is ok only movie i really liked her in was bridesmaids spy was ok too i went in with no expectations and was severely disappointed it never really grabs more than a chuckle from me and the story was pretty bad the only real funny parts came from leslie jones and kate mckinnon which were only two scenes kate mckinnons 2 minute action scene in the final battle was cool but overall i felt underwhelmed by this reboot there was so much opportunity and potential with such an amazing franchise and cast oh well
Jul 15 2016,negative,as much as i tried to like it it felt like rewarmed dinner from last week it was clearly a cloying money grab glad i used a free ticket for it
Jul 15 2016,negative,desperate attempt at equality bridesmaids is actual equality women writing a hilarious movie with real female characters that actual females can actually identify with   this attempt at a false equality ie woman are just like men and do the exact same things but better oh and every male part should be a bumbling buffoon or mean or idiot foils for women to show there superior physical skills against is getting soooo tired
Jul 15 2016,positive,i loved this movie kept me laughing the entire time the cast was awesome the story was solid the ending was epic dont know why this movie got some bad reviews but i saw the original in the theater and r his was just as good if not better
Jul 15 2016,positive,if dan aykroyd bill murray and ernie hudson are in the movie then by golly that speaks volumes dont listen to the critics most of the time their reviews are like squirting lemon juice in your eyes    it is a reboot to the original moviehowever i think this movie should be given a fair chance  its not the first cast nor part of the first three moviesbut that is what makes the first ghostbusters franchise special nothing can replace it to have a reboot and experience a new twist on a favorite ghost hunting adventure with my family is a win win for me  kate mckinnon rocked her part and to see bill ernie dan and harold  throughout the movie was an amazing treat  kept my kid interested throughout the whole movie which is difficult to do
Jul 15 2016,neutral,ok movie and ok attempt to revive the story of red original movie  i think the original movie is much better
Jul 15 2016,positive,nice but it could be better
Jul 15 2016,negative,the absolute worst dont waste the cash
Jul 15 2016,positive,this movie was amazing
Jul 15 2016,positive,freaking loved it better then expected  a few confusing scenes the only bad  not very convincing female lead was kristen wigg i found her not a very interesting or believable character she feel flat and i think it was because they tired to hard to make her character likable everyone was just awesome love love love it 
Jul 15 2016,negative,awful awful waste of my money and time the most of the movie was male bashing not cool at all with out the first movie being such a success with all male stars on it then these actresses wouldnt have a movie like this shame on the horrible director of this horrible movie an epic failure
Jul 15 2016,negative,this movie is just awful rather than make a movie that stands on it own sony basically had paul feig make a 2 hour cash grab with no substance im really disappointed in the critical response this film has gotten its misleading to the average movie goer
Jul 15 2016,negative,slimer is an accurate description of this movie pos
Jul 15 2016,positive,so much fun loved every minute must see it again
Jul 15 2016,positive,great a bit slow to get going but loved it fight at the end is epic gave me goosebumps hubby loved it too he felt it was better than the original and i agree    ignore the reviews from angry fanboys who dont believe in playing fair and think they should give bad reviews of a movie they havent seen instead of letting the public see it and make up their own minds
Jul 15 2016,negative,simply put if you liked the original you will hate this film if you didnt like the original dont see it anyway because it isnt funny or interesting money better spent elsewhere
Jul 15 2016,negative,dont waste your time or money on the garbage
Jul 15 2016,negative,its just not good nothing wrong with the cast it could have been great but its a sellout movie
Jul 15 2016,positive,so funny loved all the women bill murray dan aykroyd  ernie hudson cameos were great
Jul 15 2016,positive,a misleading trailer made us think that this movie was awful but now that ive seen it i think this is a fresh start and gives us enough laughs to give life to a whole new generation of fans
Jul 15 2016,positive,so funny so much fun loved every minute
Jul 15 2016,negative,this amazing cast could not save the terrible script   it had potential to be great it was an overdone cartooning of a classic
Jul 15 2016,negative,horrible writing horrible directing horrible story horrible character chemistry horrible jokesi have never seen a more perfect personification of a cash grap something that doesnt respect its license or its fans and was made simple to create a cinematic universe with which to make money and nothing more
Jul 15 2016,negative,this is a disgusting imitation of a really good movie that is exploitative unoriginal and unfunny there is so little of worth in this film it has little to do with the manipulative allfemale selling point of the film and everything to do with the extraordinarily bad writing complete lack of chemistry and a distinctly inhuman set of dialogue nobody in this film speaks like a human being not a single male character in this film is intelligent the jokes come together as a hodgepodge of mediocre snl skits that are sloppily thrown together the certified fresh rating of this film is not only completely off the mark but is a foreboding indicator of rts reliability in the future    the only decent aspects of this movie are a small handful of decent jokes and one cameo that is passable as well as a few good effects otherwise this movie is an abysmal wasteland of a film that i beg you to not support in any way shape or form
Jul 15 2016,positive,so glad i ignored all the negative comments and went to judge for myself  brilliant film dragged a little towards the end and id of preferred some more music in it but thoroughly enjoyed it
Jul 15 2016,negative,not what i was expecting totally fell below my standards
Jul 15 2016,positive,this film is solid and despite the collective warnings of so many ghostbusters purists the original movies still exist childhoods werent destroyed and a new movie was born that is hilarious and completely worthy to add to the franchise
Jul 15 2016,negative,they killed bill murray who plays a skeptic worst film of 2016 so far
Jul 15 2016,negative,the original was one of the funniest movies of all time i wanted to like this one for that reason alone not to mention the quality of the cast  this however is one of the worst films of the decade  a wooden uninventive script that makes some seriously funny actresses unfunny shoddy direction not an ounce of clever anywhere  this movie is horrible
Jul 15 2016,negative,stiff acting loud flashy cgi and jam packed with jokes that would make the lazy sunday dad jokes your father told around the dinner table seem like gems
Jul 15 2016,negative,i expected to hate this film because the trailers made all the women out to be very stupid and moronic the guys in the original were not i have zero issue with an all female cast just make them strong females as far as this aspect goes the trailers were a major misrepresentation of the actual film  sony knew exactly what they were doing with the marketing we saw nothing from this film until 2 months before its release by design as soon as this movie was announced there was major backlash so sony put out the worst trailers they could trust me the trailers had the worst parts of the film in them on purpose they wanted people to hate the trailers this is marketing 101 that way when the film gets released people will say it was nowhere near as bad as they expected and that is exactly what happened with all of the early reviews  the first 20 minutes was surprisingly good and then it was on a downward spiral for the rest of the film a completely forgettable and boring film  i actually loved the cast and cannot wait for the sequel but they need to get the director nixed from going anywhere near the next film he was writer producer and director on this project and he ruined the film it was boring the most boring film i have seen in theatres in decades seriously the story was not there worst villain ever with nothing to attach it too  as far as the performances go they all did a great job very unique personalities and not the oafs that the trailer made them out to be not even close the only performance i did not like was chris hemsworths character he was the dumbest character i have ever seen on film he did not belong in this film not hemsworth himself just his character kevin nobody is as stupid as his was it was a major miss his character was so out of place  there were also maybe 3 laughs in the whole film most jokes fell completely flat and were forced overall 5 minutes of the film was fantastic 2 or 3 minutes of the film was just unbearable and the rest was just blah and uninteresting  the film had everything it needed except a great story and a better directer these issues fall squarely on paul feig  in the end i give it a 25 stars a waste of time and a waste of a great opportunity what a complete shame
Jul 15 2016,positive,i wasnt expecting much from this but was wonderfully surprised the cast were awesome the acting really good and the cameos really well orchestrated it doesnt matter in the slightest that this is a remake its one of the best remakes ive ever seen and didnt contain the cheesiness of so many nods to the original at all the right moments good script and a fun film
Jul 15 2016,positive,this was so fun id go right back into the theater and see it again  positive clever and hilarious  they pulled this off beautifully  i loved it  and i believe they vanquished the sexist haters
Jul 15 2016,positive,good movie  not close to the first one but okay
Jul 15 2016,negative,the humor just isnt there unless youre a women in which case you will probably find this hilarious
Jul 15 2016,positive,ghostbusters was good but not great in some respects it was better than i thought it would be but sometimes the jokes fell flat which was unfortunate id give it a 7
Jul 15 2016,positive,an enjoyable film not groundbreaking but it was far from as bad as people slamming it before release had made out it could be the jokes hit well and the redesign of equipment and sets was fine mostly all four characters felt far more rounded then the original ghostbusters cast its only failing was there where moments in which the constant onslaught of mostly funny jokes began to ware overall solid and worth seeing
Jul 15 2016,negative,if this was not a ghostbusters movie i would give it 2 12 stars but they made a parody and slapped ghostbusters on the title pretend the movie is called spectercatchers or something of the sort if you must watch it
Jul 15 2016,negative,the majority of the jokes dont work the characters have none of the chemistry of the original cast the antagonists plot is a dumbeddown version of the plot of the 2009 videogame minus any explanation  this may be the single worst role chris hemsworth ever has to put on his resume seriously his character is the worst thing about this movie for a movie whose creators were so quick to slap down the sexism card it treats all the men in the movie like freaking morons especially hemsworth and does nothing to make the female cast worth emotionally investing in skip it
Jul 15 2016,positive,we really enjoyed it my 11 yr has watched the originals several times over the years she really enjoyed it i liked that the ghosts were similar and that there were so many references to the original we  gb
Jul 15 2016,positive,amazing people really need to give it a chance 
Jul 15 2016,positive,bunch of haters because its not the original cast the movie was pretty good
Jul 15 2016,positive,having not grown up with this movie i dont seem to have the strong nostalgia the rest of the world does for the original had the original never existed this movie would be a great summer blockbuster unfortunately it has been forced to live up to peoples impossible standards i was impressed with the way they were able to balance the nostalgia and the new without being heavy handed unlike other recent reboots and was blown away by the stellar cast i feel no shame in saying that i did feel a jolt of excitement when the ladies got to kick ass in the final sequence and to hell with all the antifeminists it is hardly the main point of the movie but just a welcome addition that rarely gets to be seen in big budget films like this overall i thought this movie was a great effort held high by the wit of director paul feig and the four leading ladies it honours the originals but is able to stand on its own by bringing appropriate updates for a new audience
Jul 15 2016,positive,great film i saw the original ghostbusters as a kid and loved it and thoroughly enjoyed this version as well chris hemsworth steals the show in quite a few scenes and leslie jones is really funny as well
Jul 15 2016,neutral,somewhat entertaining but no reason to exist
Jul 15 2016,positive,i didnt think i would like this movie well the rampant hate on it made me think it might be rough i love the first one but am not much of a fan of the rest   my cheeks hurt from smiling so much sure its not perfect but its wonderful for what it is a fun summer movie i laughed out loud more than i had ever expected
Jul 15 2016,negative,as a progressive woman in a science field im massively offended that they have called this a feminist empowerment piece not only does it go into stereotypes that are borderline cartoonish but it propagates the idea that because im a millennial female im not aware of what is considered good screenwriting let alone comedy writing its an insulting film what made the original so timeless was its realism and clever character interaction this film comes off as something made purely with cash signs in their vision the original was written to be innovative and intellectually funny this film is not that
Jul 15 2016,negative,being a a kristen wiig fan i came with an open mind also seeing decent reviews why not see for myself if its good or bad well the movie sucks lol its pretty boring and not that funny it will make a decent tbs movie in the future though
Jul 15 2016,positive,anyone rating this poorly obviously has some bias   this was a perfectly good movie the only reason people will be voting down for it will be because they were on the bandwagon of hate long before the movie came out and they dont want it to slow down     if you put your pride and ego aside for just 2 hours there shouldnt be any reason why you wont like this movie
Jul 15 2016,positive,fun and funny this new ghostbusters isnt as deep or satisfying as the original indeed is is a feig parody of the original but its not disrespectful like bays movies always seem to be theres too much chris helmsworth being hotashell and dumbasbricks a good bit of that time could have been better used as story its worth a watch     i dislike that they didnt use the original siren for the car for some reason it really bugs me
Jul 15 2016,negative,this movie brings shame to the old movie and insults both genders the humor is poorly scripted and is meant for those under the age of 13 with farts jokes they even go with horrible stereotypes which hits on man and women alike overall one of the worst movies i have seen save your money and do not go
Jul 15 2016,positive,good effects chris was cool but bitches were stupid and trying too hard
Jul 15 2016,positive,i like the movie and it was fun and entertaining funny too
Jul 15 2016,negative,ughwhat did i watch the video game was better than this
Jul 15 2016,negative,this movie was an insult to the original the jokes and characters fall flat if i laughed three times instead of cringing it would have been a lot bad writing jumbled plot cartoonlike onedimensional characters
Jul 15 2016,negative,i gave this movie a chance and i have to say it does not live up to the hype trailers made it seem funnier than it actually is  its painful how idiotic and stupid men are portrayed in this film   the jokes are forcedshoe horned and elicited mild chuckles very intermittently from the audience in the cinema this movie doesnt know what its trying to be and really trails off toward the end the hype does not justify this movie in any way
Jul 15 2016,positive,this was a very good movie even though whats in the original ghostbusters it had smart comedy and even though you could tell the ghost were cgi it doesnt take anything away from the movie 
Jul 15 2016,neutral,i love the original ghostbusters  the sequel not so much  this reboot  it was ok  i like that they rebooted it with an all female cast  i was very disappointed to learn that it did not take place in the same universe and was a whole new story with nods to the original  it definitely had moments of humour but much of it fell flat  hemsworth was a highlight with most of his scenes getting a laugh  mccarthy wiig  jones are all pretty good  mckinnon goes overboard and becomes irritating after a while  when it comes to fighting ghosts most of the changes dont work  i dont remember ghostbusters ever punching shooting and grinding up ghosts  most of the finale also didnt work for me  i watched this with my 14 year old daughter and she was mostly just shaking her head  she liked it less than i did
Jul 15 2016,negative,bummer wanted this to be good only laughs were already in the trailers
Jul 15 2016,positive,i did expect to like this film at all and i can kind of understand why some people dont like it if you wanted a proper film to the ghostbuster this is nothing close to it but if you are willing to realize they arent going to make the version of ghostbusters the hardcore fans want this is just about as good as it will get it and that aint bad     its a comedy not scifihorror the story is simple maybe too simple the characters are pretty one dimensional but still pretty likable     is the girl power film to prove women can do anything men can do uh no is it the worst film in the history of the world uh no     its just a fun time at the movie i dont feel like i was ripped off and i would have no problem if they said they were making a sequel
Jul 15 2016,positive,this ghostbusters remake was so funny and scary i cant wait for the sequal 
Jul 15 2016,negative,15    at the risk of being called a misogynistthis was not a very good movie the characters were clichéd paper thin and unfunny the script came right out of the hollywood reboot factory its not a complete nostalgia trip but not brave enough to stand on its own either all youre left with is a flat movie with some vomit inducing winkwink nudgenudge moments
Jul 15 2016,negative,straight garbage
Jul 15 2016,negative,awkward and sloppy and forced
Jul 15 2016,positive,the movie the internet loves to hate turned out to actually be pretty entertaining i dug the story and the new cast pretty well and even the action sequences were really well done and did things that the original movie couldnt due to effect constraints of the time  the only parts i really disliked involved the kevin character it really felt like they couldnt decide if they wanted him to be just a little dumb or basically an asshole  over all a good start to a possible future franchise i look forward to more
Jul 15 2016,positive,got me laughing right from the start great lines enjoyable characters and solid busting adventure
Jul 15 2016,negative,i now understand why bill murray did his best to prevent a 3rd one from happening  tried to be as open minded as possible  the movie was kind of entertaining so i gave it 2 stars for that melissa mccarthy did the best with what she had all the actors did for that matter but the writing was just really bad it wasnt clever or really that funny the theater i watched it in probably had about 20 or so people in it which is small but everybody was dead silent the entire time
Jul 15 2016,positive,i enjoyed this movie  i think the action was awesome and the horror aspect really scary  not only did i jump a couple of times the whole theater audience did  the chemistry between the actors was off the chart awesome  i especially loved the chris hemsworth moments and kate mckinnon character was awesome  cameos made me giddyespecially the final credits  im very proud of paul feig and co pulling this off  i left grinning
Jul 15 2016,positive,you know i think the pure joy the remake has of embracing its silly escapism elevates the movie a bit its summer popcorn fluff that works a reboot not chained to its origins but acknowledges it wittingly with gasp smart funny women as heroes it did its job it entertained thats all i wanted
Jul 15 2016,negative,sad representation of its predecessor the screen writers for this film seem to love throwing big words around in the movie without looking up the meaning to them first the science seemed rushed and sadly spit on the cgi was terrible at some points in the film there was a lack of taste to the film like the previous films brought the science of the weapons seemed to swing to what was needed in the heat of the moment and not probable physics i loved the prequels and had hoped for a well planned reboot sadly i think the script was ran over by a stampede of cows and then washed and dried in a sauna i do not recommend this film unless you like to roll your eyes and hope for the end to come soon
Jul 15 2016,positive,very good way better than expected my son loved it too good homage to originals without over doing it rowan before the factwas the worst part i guess but not that bad cliche on purpose i think dont listen to the hate from those who couldnt be bothered from their man baby tantrums to actually watch the film i think i love kate mckinnon
Jul 15 2016,positive,this movie exceeded expectations for me  i expected okay  it was amazing   funny a few  good nice callbacks to the original films but it stands on its own very well       the characters are fun the action is great    this film does make jokes around gender politics and lampshades sexist tropes  if you are the type of person who thinks political correctness is ruining the world you probably should skip this one
Jul 15 2016,negative,not funny all stereotypes the first joke is about queefs has the franchise really dropped this low in quality disapointing
Jul 15 2016,negative,can people please stop giving this director jobs
Jul 15 2016,positive,amazing movie put aside your misogyny and your bias towards the original films and just respect it as a really well made and well written piece of cinema brilliant gags throughout excellent acting
Jul 15 2016,negative,this just proves that these kinds of websites get bought off by the people that make these movies
Jul 15 2016,positive,loved it time to sit down sexist manbaby clowns byeeeee
Jul 15 2016,negative,talented people given nothing to do talking in small interiors and occasionally in tedious action scenes
Jul 15 2016,negative,typical absurd women comedy completely anoying
Jul 15 2016,neutral,16 ghostbusters according to the internet was looking like it would be the fant4stic fantastic four of this year in a already very underwhelming summer movie seasonbut its not    in a strange way this film is still able to bring out a fair amount of laughs and in typical paul feig style putting some of the worst jokes front and center in trailerspromotional spots as crazy as it may sounds the cameos in ghostbusters in alternative light wasnt a bad idea to mix things up for this new franchise    the real issues with the film lies with the script leaving leslie jones and kate mckinnon to becoming cartoon characters despite a good joke or 2 from them    one of the worst issues is all of the men in this film are portrayed as complete idiots    in the end 16 ghostbusters is not deserving of all the hate it received unlike other films that came out this year but doesnt really hold much urgency or importance in the long run    ghostbusters 510
Jul 15 2016,positive,funny and engaging a great action movie which builds on the charm of the original but modernises it love kate mckinnon and leslie jones
Jul 15 2016,positive,the first two original movies had things in them that made me super uncomfortable this movie is a much more friendlier movie and i would recommend it before the original two
Jul 15 2016,negative,did not enjoy it there is no rush to see this movie on the big screen
Jul 15 2016,negative,they really didnt seem to know what they wanted this to end up being  sequel  reboot  original  parody  its hard to tell what the goal was and the end result is a mishmash of what can only be described as a horror comedy where the only horror lays in the fact that the jokes fall flat more often than not  as a woman i really was hoping that this would raise the bar for how us ladies are represented in hollywood but ultimately i was let down    next time they expect me to answer the call ill have changed my number
Jul 15 2016,positive,better than ghostbusters 2 but not as good as the original it was nice to see the original cast in cameos though
Jul 15 2016,neutral,if they cut down on the humor get rid of a few scenes and made some more changes this movie wouldve been better its not the worse movie of this summer or even year but its not great either
Jul 15 2016,positive,i thought the film was good good few laughs  chris hemsworth is so fuuny which i was quite suprise at  the main female cast were also great
Jul 15 2016,neutral,not worth 18 dollars for this movie
Jul 15 2016,positive,enjoyed watching ghost busters 
Jul 15 2016,negative,really not a great movie it feels like one long snl skit the lead actresses seem to be playing themselves rather than characters and embracing stereotypes for example the black character saying oh hellllll no in the original winston the black character wasnt a stereotype but someone just in the ghostbusters for a paycheque he was someone everyone could relate to unfortunately this movies had none of what the made original so great it seems more like the marketing time was trying to profit by appealing to the feminist wave than actually making a good movie proof of this can be seen in the ads for this movie featuring reviews about how the main characters are women rather than actually giving insight into the film dont bother watching
Jul 15 2016,negative,this movie was not as horrible as many may think there are a few good jokes but in all honesty it does not hold a candle to its name sake ghostbusters 2016 is a reboot for the sponge bob generation where neanderthal jokes including fart jokes fat people falling down and body fluids make up the comedy of the film while sony tossed cameos and symbolic references in the film to keep the fans from being violent not to mention merchandising  merchandising merchandising which uses all the original ghostbusters  flat out the film is rushed makes no sense how do you use nukes to stop ghosts also the logo thing seriously the final battle that has a god like being that can control everyone but the busters and the cameos sighs
Jul 15 2016,positive,dont listen to any of the reviews by sexist men here is the reality of this movie those who are expecting it to be like the original its not neither are the video games books comics and etc the fact ur basing the movie solely on the fact its an all female cast and you wanted it to be all male again is just stupid he movie is good while some jokes may fall flat the movie is funny the cgi is cgi what movie doesnt have it now good movie to go see with anyone who isnt sexist and expect it to be just like the original he update delivered for me especially as acid a ghost buster fan as i have been for many years
Jul 15 2016,negative,movie sucksperiod
Jul 15 2016,positive,very good well done good use of 3d much better than trailers indicate very good cameos be sure to stay till the very end
Jul 15 2016,negative,if you look at the critic views you see a trend notice how there over 70 and then you look at the user reviews and its below 50 theres a reason for that the movie is a cash grab and is bad no matter what the company and people with a agendas try to say at the end of the day a turd is a turd even though this is a shinny turd
Jul 15 2016,positive,i really like this movie its fun its funny a couple of parts are a little spooky its not perfect but its charm is enough for me to over look the flaws the world has four new ghostbusters
Jul 15 2016,negative,what a mess of a movie not funny at all
Jul 15 2016,negative,ignore the professional reviews and the certified fresh rating this one is a stinker     acting was stiff and had zero chemistry and nearly every joke all the ones involving the main cast fall completely flat only hemsworth looks like hes having any fun with the film and it shows as he basically carries the whole thing it also suffers from the typical sony reboot pattern of replacing classic practical effects with really terrible cgi  not as bad as it could of been but i really hope this gets punished at the box office and ends up as the final nail in the coffin for sonys biyearly reboot cashgrab    12 a pizza roll out of 10
Jul 15 2016,positive,laughed nonstop lots of fun jokes and physical humor like falling and getting slimed it is a good summer movie and fun for older kids
Jul 15 2016,positive,i thought the story was good it was funny and the effects were awesome i thought the cast was great and the top of the game goes out to kate mckinnon so be sure you get holtzmanned  kristen wiig is adorable as usual and melissa and leslie are both well suited to their characters both smart and funny i wanted to see it as soon as i saw the trailer and this will not disappoint  so go see it have a couple of hours of fun take your kids and enjoy it
Jul 15 2016,negative,quite possibly the worst big budget movie ever made i think i may have laughed twice not funny poor action bad storyline an all around bad remake i think that critics are rating it high because of the female cast and not wanting to seem sexist this movie is pure garbage
Jul 15 2016,positive,good overall film with some bad moments and a weak overall villain
Jul 15 2016,positive,ghostbusters unites a talented cast of snl stars along with one of modern comedys best directors in a combination of charm laughs and spooks that earn it a comfortable position in the classic franchise
Jul 15 2016,negative,poorly made unfunny feminist propaganda masquerading on the success of an 80s classic avoid at all costs
Jul 15 2016,positive,very pleasantly surprised  was not terribly excited for this film after the trailer but the punchlines hit for the most part and the fx were dazzling  as far as i was concerned it was another fun spooky ghostbusters flick
Jul 15 2016,neutral,in my opinion it was nowhere as good as the first two ghostbuster movies i must admit the movie was still pretty good the plot was decent the ladies did a very good job and the cgi ghosts were on point  i also liked the way they worked the original cast into the movie but i do kinda of wish they could have some connected original cast  to the ladies of the new cast  i mean it was like the first two ghostbusters never happened now going forward can they come back with another one in my opinion its a toss up well have to see how good this one dose
Jul 15 2016,positive,i really enjoyed this movie in my opinion the story was put together well the cast was hilarious and the cinematography was also excellent i would go see it again in a heartbeat     now if you are a sentimental expecting this film to live in the same realm as murray aykroyd ramis and hudson  you probably wont enjoy this movie partly due to the different overall tone of the film and because you might have already made up your mind
Jul 15 2016,positive,loved it much more than i expected it to  great flick that stands on its own merits with cool nods to the original classic
Jul 15 2016,positive,just finished watching ghostbusters  this movie is hilarious
Jul 15 2016,negative,this was an awful remakejust overweight ladies screaming and critics just gave it positive reviews so people wouldnt call them sexist
Jul 15 2016,positive,this movie was so fantastic i plan on seeing it again the entire audience clapped and raved how much they enjoyed it when the movie ended not sure the reason of the madness behind the negative reviewsbut this movie was great
Jul 15 2016,positive,a good 4 star action supernatural comedy  given 5 though to try to counter all the horrific comments its well made lots of fun and made me laugh
Jul 15 2016,negative,this movie is a total dude  this cast is a total disaster and the script is just horrendous who ya gonna call sure as hell not paul feig for another film
Jul 15 2016,positive,ghostbusters has all of the good quirks of a feig flick like many of the same faces that stared in his previous films and brings something new to the 80s classic     i think most of us raised with classics like the original ghostbusters and its subsequent sequel shared a collective annoyed sigh when we heard that they were going to messing with one of our beloved 80s movies i know it escaped my lips but as the ensemble started to come together it peaked my interest all the more as release date approached now its no secret that i love melissa mccarthy and kristen wiig and they were the two coupled with feig that held my interest in seeing this film until more trailers arrived     mccarthy and wiig pull off their characters respectively well and with the continued chemistry they shared in bridesmaids     leslie jones pulls off her character well also tough new yorker turned paranormal hunter with all the attitude of a tyler perry character and the oneliners to match     but the real treat here is kate mckinnon her ability to portray such an eccentric egonesque holtsmann is astounding her wise cracks her hilarious outward views all seemed to flow from somewhere very natural and it wouldnt surprise me if she is a bit like this in person and thats someone i would like to meet    if youre looking for an academy award winner or something thats going to move you emotionally gb probably isnt for you show up to this movie with an unbiased look dont compare it so closely to the original that you lose sight of the intended purpose here you will laugh you will be astonished at the special effects works put into this and you will be able to see how it pays homage to its humble beginnings i gave it for stars for that simple reason its well done well acted and total brainless entertainment relax turn your mind off for a couple of hours and answer the call
Jul 15 2016,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed this movie it was funny and fast paced sure it was a little ridiculous and cheesy at times but thats because its a ghostbusters reboot what else could you expect ignore the negative reviews and go check it out
Jul 15 2016,negative,da fuq    advert your eyes  seriously though ive seen porn parodies with more integrity than this  spend your money on blow and booze just not this film
Jul 15 2016,negative,insult to the original ghostbusters
Jul 15 2016,negative,i really wanted to give this movie a chance but it was horrible i mean just bad jokes that dont land a timeline that seemed way too quick sophomoric humor would have been welcome and the cameos god i hope they got paid well for this i only had to pay 2 dollars for the movie i died for you sins
Jul 15 2016,positive,being that i grew up on ghostbusters 1 and really didnt care for ghostbusters 2 i was afraid to see this movie    but i was very surprised i really enjoyed the movie  i found it funny and fun  i didnt look at my watch once while the movie was going  the film itself was witty and fun  i like the characters not being a carbon copy of characters from the originals  i like the nods to the original movie and i do like the feel    the story was week but that is to be expected for a comedy that keeps the laughs going  two of the cameos felt extremely forced and pulled me out of the movie  but overall i would see it again its just fun
Jul 15 2016,negative,not the type of humor i like
Jul 15 2016,negative,below sums this price of crap remake up     1984 you believed the people involved cared     2016 they careabout the money
Jul 15 2016,positive,was great had some minor flaws the biggest being half of the jokes didnt hit but over all fun and entertaining
Jul 15 2016,positive,how exciting trump is showing who secret racists are and this movie is showing who secret sexists are this was a good movie it was funny and smart im sure all you haters wouldve been ok with an all male reboot just like you were ok with the god awful gb3
Jul 15 2016,positive,the original is my all time favorite movie and this was a fun take on an iconic franchise if you cant sit down  enjoy this movie for 2 hours you probably dont like enjoying things
Jul 15 2016,positive,is it the best movie i have ever seen no but it was a fun ride that held on to me for the entire runtime doesnt deserve even half of the vitriol its getting from people who havent and wont see it but still want to give it a low score
Jul 15 2016,positive,great fun despite a slow start is it as good as the classic original no but its far far more enjoyable than the last ghostbusters movie we got the cast works very well together especially kate mckinnon who is so brilliantly funny she almost feels underused
Jul 15 2016,negative,this movie was terrible i love the original ghostbusters but this one was not nearly as good it was overly cheesy but none of the intended jokes landed if given the option do not see this movie
Jul 15 2016,negative,horrible male hating snl skit
Jul 15 2016,negative,by far worse movie ever good job guys
Jul 15 2016,negative,not sexist but this is a remakereboot too far looks about as funny as catching aids and quite honestly id rather cover my genitalia in jam and stick it in a red ants nest for an hour and a half than watch this please god i hope this film fails massively and is deleted from existence forever
Jul 15 2016,positive,fun fun fun great female cast their boy toy has character especially during the credits  boisterous laughter from the room great to see cameos stay till credits end
Jul 15 2016,negative,just awful dont waste your money
Jul 15 2016,negative,my review since imdb limits reviews to 1000 words im posting my full review here     link to video version      30 years ago four friends saved the world now a new team will answer the call     30 years ago four scientists saved new york     the above quotes directly from the two different versions of the ghostbusters 2016 trailer infers a direct sequel to the first two films through acknowledgment of the franchises previous events     however a third ghostbusters 1984 had been stalled in development for nearly 15 years until director paul feig pitched a reboot instead     dan aykroyd confirmed that the 2016 films cameo appearances including himself bill murray ernie hudson and sigourney weaver have them playing different characters     paul feigs comments before filming in which he stated that he did not want to make a film in a universe where people were already used to seeing ghosts such as the original ghostbusters completely negate the movie trailers opening     so if both the director paul feig and the original writer dan aykroyd are both confirming no existence of the prior two films why is it that the official trailers of the 2016 reboot is acknowledging the previous events of the franchise     i will let you answer that one yourself     it is no secret this film has been receiving a lot of criticism mostly aimed at the all female cast but the reasoning behind that is not as simple as most defenders of the film are making it     the reality of it is most people simply dislike the fact the original films are being erased and the franchise has become something entirely different     the original films focused on four men that is fact that is not sexist     fact of the matter is the 2016 version should just have owned itself this film should proudly be its own entity this is a film about a team of females that fight ghosts own that call it your own call it something different     but the producers are afraid to do such a thing they need that ghostbusters label to sell it period     in other words the are mocking the actual audience they are trying to gain with this version     i would totally support an all female ghost fighting team again it has nothing to do with sexism and everything to do with owning your own     take indiana jones for instance could that be rebooted with a woman im sure it could but that would not be owning it for the woman now would it instead it would be taking what a man did and recreating it for the female demographic     instead what really happened was a franchise called tomb raider that spanned a series of successful video games two feature films and a soontobe reboot with you guessed it a female still in the role     how silly would it sound and look to present a new tomb raider with a male as the lead     what about the alien franchise should we replace the female lead with a male no     instead other alien creature movies were created that stood on their own featuring male leads     take halloween 3 for instance the name was used to draw a crowd to a familiar franchise yet had absolutely nothing to do with the originals and bombed massively     i am just saying this new film should proudly wear its own label empowering the all female cast instead of mocking and placing them under the shadow of an already successful franchise they show little faith that these women can carry something on their own the irony throwing in chris hemsworth just places the icing on the cake that this film is trying to target a female audience that to me is the sexist part of all this     in other words i completely support the idea of an original all female ghost killinghuntingtrappingwhatever movie but i am completely against the idea of this being ghostbusters why because it is not     please stop screaming sexism when someone has a negative view on this film im sure there are people out there who are being negative and are sexist but not every comment has to be labeled as such     now lets talk about the look of this new film     the first two films ghostbusters 1984 and ghostbusters 2 1989 had a charm to them well mostly the first one there were qualities of comedy adventure love and horror     there is possession in both the original and the 2016 reboot     the possession in the original was dark and even frightening for children the original gave the impression that ghosts were to be feared     the possession in the 2016 reboot attempts to be entirely comical losing the fear quality completely sure people are running sure people are screaming but it is all overshadowed by corny flat jokes and a cartoon atmosphere     i admit as a kid seeing the character dana from the original startled and attacked by demonic claws ripping through her chair was frightening there was nothing funny about it     the 2016 reboot honestly gave me a scooby doo or goosebumps feel rather than a ghostbusters feel     with that being said take away all of the ghostbusters familiarities and canon theme song take away the ecto1 car take away slimer the proton packs etc and all you have are four girls attempting to rid the city of ghosts in what appears to be an extended dry saturday night live skit     therefore come up with your own idea with four woman as leads and call it something else stop calling it that     film studios make money thats why they are in the business yet time and time again they refuse to listen to the very people the consumer that pay for their creations the audience is the very reason movies are made and made with making money in mind so when you see an undeniable and unprecedented dislike for the idea you are boasting you may want to take a moment to rethink your plan     proof in the pudding known as their massive damage control with their marketing the closer the release of the film approached showed me they are extremely worried about their product paying off interviews with the original cast in addition to the over saturation of tv spots is a desperation move and keep in mind aykroyd profits from this film so of course he is going to speak highly of it     as far as the end result the film completely fell flat across the board i have nothing against the four leads i more or less blame the writers director and the studios choice of direction for the new ghostbusters     the acting is some of the most stiff and cookie cutter i have ever seen there were times when it really sounded like they were reading their lines the actors did not mesh well at all and their interaction with all of the blue and green screen effects was lifeless and clueless     i was just lost with the approach on their attempted humor i mean its bad i dont know what panel sat around the table reading the script and laughed at it but i hope they never do again     the effects were horrible every time which was a lot they used a green screen i found myself taken away from the movie     the film constantly contradicts its own established continuity one minute they cant kill the ghosts only contain them the next they can just ridiculous     they even added a segment to the movie early on that shows the four girls poking fun at all of the hate for the film i just dont think the studio gets it     more mocking of the very people they expect to pay top dollar for their product     despite all of the sexist remarks towards the movie the movie itself is extremely sexist against men and borderline racist all men are portrayed as fools in the movie and in order to kill the final villain they have to shoot him in the crotch     it almost seems the team behind the film knew how stereotypical and sexist their movie was so they capitalized on the sexism against the film in order to hide that     i honestly recommend wearing a padded glove when you watch this if you watch this i have never facepalmed so many times during a movie in my life i would not suggest this film to anyone except maybe children under ten years old and even then it would simply be for a cartoonish 3d experience     i wish i could find positives because i dislike being so negative about a film i understand completely the amount of work that goes into something like this chris hemsworth was probably the best part of this believe or not i could see him leading a team of his own ghostbusters in another version if written correctly     but i cant help but quote jurassic park concerning the very idea of this film     the filmmakers were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didnt stop to think if they should     i really did try to give this film a chance despite all of the negative hype but the film was not funny and does not stand on its own honestly the only thing that intrigued me was seeing the cameos from some of the original cast    i will add that if you were thinking you had seen the majority of the movie throughout all of the trailers various clips tv spots etc you would have been thinking correctly sony used all of what they considered to be the best material in all of the promotional releases let that be your red flag considering how poor the trailers were     i wish the film success i dont wish failure on it maybe im simply part of a small fraction that absolutely disliked it but it was not for me     if someone were to ask me if they should go see it i would say no but if you are curious just wait for it to become available for internet streaming     i typically rate movies based on a ten star system in other words were there ten elements involved that made me want to see it again i rate this movie one star because it did make me want to write an in depth review about it it did accomplish that     i dont think people will walk away from this movie afraid of ghosts i imagine they walk away afraid of the movie and more so the people who thought it was wise to make it in the first place     there is some irony here ghostbusters 2016 has literally become a ghost it was dead on arrival
Jul 15 2016,positive,with all of the bad publicity that was heaped on this movie prior to opening i expected a bad or at best mediocre flick not the case this movie is hilarious the plot draws a bit from the original but it is also a stand alone all four ladies deliver and chris hemsworth provides some great eyecandy as well as comedy chops i really didnt know he had i loved it and will see it again not for the kiddies cause some of the ghosts are a bit scary but it is a fun viewing that does not merit the bad reviews i highly recommend this movie
Jul 15 2016,negative,this movie is an otherwise terrible work held up only by the desperate attempts of critics to see it in a good light i tried to give it a chance i did the humor was flat and predictable nothing like the original ghostbusters films but does it stand on its own only in the way that a thirdrate comedy lazily directed and produced so as to obviously pander to an audience hellbent on defending it from some imagined misogynistic critics i think that the idea of a female cast was refreshing but the execution just makes it a plain bad movie overall if youre looking for a movie to pretend to like in order to fuel a victim complex i recommend this highly if youre looking to laugh or even have mild interest in a film i must say to you avoid this movie at all costs
Jul 15 2016,negative,this movie was honestly horrific 010 would not watch again
Jul 15 2016,positive,i would just like to say that this movie should be looked at on its own and not harshly compared to the original this movie was filled with funny jokes and amazing effects people should go in to the movie without thinking of the original they arent going to be the same and if they were you would still be upset and would say they were just copying the whole thing to properly enjoy the movie you have to come in with an open mind and enjoy it for what it is
Jul 15 2016,positive,this movie gets a lot of bad reviews i completley disagree look no it is not the original movie but they have rebooted it spectacularly it was given a darker tone than the original while still keeping that charming hilarity please do not decide this movie is not worth going to see just because it is different
Jul 15 2016,positive,great movie funny and scary at times didnt try to compete with old ghostbusters but was a movie on its own which i think having female characters really helped add to that
Jul 15 2016,positive,it was alright did like the cameos from original ghostbusters
Jul 15 2016,negative,a shameless cash grab given just enough political drama to make it appealing to the permanently offended ghostbusters is mess from beginning to end and the worst thing about this film is just how bland it is the jokes arent funny the villain isnt interesting the acting is awful and the writing is gurl powar levels of cringe worthy the only thing that is remarkable about this film is just how shoved up its own ass it is about its political message which is apparently women can do anything men can do so long as its a 30 year old proven formula if only the same level of passion and fervor had been present when actually making the film as went into its political pr campaign the film may have been half watchable
Jul 15 2016,negative,terrible movie terrible melissa mccarthy flat retarded jokes no connection or respect for previous movies and feminist finale just offensive for the hardcore fan base   just do not go to see this movie it is very mediocre
Jul 15 2016,negative,a plot that is poorly laid out a villain poorly explained or used jokes that waste the actresses potential and about as intelligent and subtle as a tuba in a piccolo quartet characters that have minimal to no depth or development the screenplay that manages to be sexist against men and women in how it portrays them on screen the film is a shameless cash grab trying to exploit the nostalgia of the original film
Jul 15 2016,negative,absolutely horrid movie  almost walked out multiple times  there were elements of a good movie in there that was lost to the slapstick drivel
Jul 15 2016,positive,its not a perfect film by any means but the ladies kill it with the chemistry they have between them kate mckinnon and leslie jones are the true stars of the film
Jul 15 2016,positive,no it doesnt stand up to the original but its a good plot with good actors and more than a few laughs to keep you entertained
Jul 15 2016,negative,kristen wiig asides this movie is absolutely pants  who you gonna call  err nobody 
Jul 15 2016,positive,i just saw the movie and i must say if your a die hard fan of the original you wont like it but if you go into the theatre with an open mind you will enjoy it the humor is very different paul feig style is not similar to ivan reitman with that said i did enjoy some moments of the new movie other parts i thought was way too silly even though the concept itself is a silly one it hard not to compare the original and new since it story mimics the first movie in some instances leslie jones and kate mckinnon do a fantastic job at stealing the show my suggestion would be to rent it when it comes out and skip the theatre worth seeing but better to see it your living room
Jul 15 2016,negative,just another horrible remake
Jul 15 2016,negative,advertised as one of the funniest movies of the year but only being hyped up by people who are trying to prove that the only reason this unfunny movie is not being completely praised by everyone across the globe is because of misogyny absolutely bland and shallow attempt of a ghostbusters movie missing the entire point of the original movie paul feig really needs to return to low budget chick flicks and not try doing high budget chick flicks with a coat of nostalgic comedies from the 80s splattered over them
Jul 15 2016,negative,why this movie exist
Jul 15 2016,negative,movie moved along at a weird pace the climax was anti and for some reason they draw out the end simply as a chance to throw in the rest of the cameos  will make you long for ghostbusters 2
Jul 15 2016,positive,its good go see it
Jul 15 2016,positive,i watched the original when i was seven and didnt realize it was supposed to be a comedy absolutely loved it anyway and that love grew as i understood it on deeper levels growing up i enjoyed the sequel watched every episode of the cartoon the real one and have longingly wished for new material for years  that being said i walked into the theater expecting a satisfying yet flawed reboot instead i was sucked in from start to finish so many familiar story elements plot devices gags and themes were there but all were employed with great respect for the source material and never felt trite i already knew the world but it still felt fresh  of course nothing can compare to the first i do recall having some critiques but right now i honestly dont remember any of them last year j j abrams did a very respectable job resurrecting a beloved franchise if that was a solid a than paul feig just earned himself some extra credit
Jul 15 2016,positive,great movie the pace of comedy keeps going and it doesnt stop i laughed a lot and had a great time and got a ton of references highly suggest it for almost anybody i wasnt expecting this movie to be as good as i thought i was actually making fun of the trailer the actors that mash up is amazing and i can say the jokes in this movie to my friends and have a laugh
Jul 15 2016,negative,its crap queef joke and seems to be meant for a 6 to 12 year old kid lame comedy like stupid awful skits uncomfortable weird terrible humor dont waste your money its for a child that makes up stories over acting 2 dimensional characters i think it was awful writing i think it was to be a money grab paying off of the series i think everyone else had to just work with this garbage 8 year old story so sad it was pooped on in the most outlandish way
Jul 15 2016,positive,its a hot mess plain and simple
Jul 15 2016,positive,solid movie it entertainly exists within the same type of world well broken in by the original it lacks some of the originality of the original but makes up for it with the charm of the leads  ensemble characters with a healthy number of nods to the original actors funny and well executed if not groundbreaking worth seeing in the theater for the special effects
Jul 15 2016,negative,what is this you have 4 great actresses and they wind up making the worst movie i have seen in a few years and why is one of the characters a racist black stereotype it is disgusting to misuse leslie jones that way it is not funny and the effects look terrible the whole movie is like one of those bad snl skits that just go on and on and on i expected a lot better from the genius behind freaks and geeks talk about jumping the shark
Jul 15 2016,positive,loved this movie  the girls are the best  it is a must see for anyone who wants to laugh
Jul 15 2016,negative,so i just got out of the theater from watching ghostbusters 2016 i have been on the fence about this movie since its announcement i have to preface by stating that i didnt have a problem with it being an allfemale cast as i figured it would shake things up a bit i am not really a fan of melissa mccarthy but when i looked up kate mckinnon i found some really funny snl skits unfortunately it seems that a lot of this films negative reaction is chalked up to misogyny instead of actual feelings about the film i was counting down the minutes until the first theatrical trailer and then i saw the trailer it really worried me as did every trailer after it then when the embargo lifted i watched every review i could find to get a fair judgment on the film the reviews where all over the place but a prevailing message of its not as bad as the trailers convinced me to give the film a chance  i left the movie angry and baffled not just at the film but the audience around me there were some fairly regular laughs and the women next to me even told her kids at the end that this is the best movie in the bunch there is an audience for this movie if you like low brow humor adam sandler films or that pepper on a stick guy you might find this movie funny this is not ghostbusters it felt like equal parts pixels and the live action scooby doo movie hell even the ghosts look like they are straight out of the scooby doo movie i tried i honestly tried there where brief moments when i was thinking hey this is a ghostbusters movie look at the proton streams the ray parker theme but then it was dashed with that is definitely not ghostbusters are the ghosts just exploding now was that a queef joke i never thought that cameos and throw backs to the original would make we groan im not saying to not go see it but if you are a huge fan of the original or not a fan of low brow humor you will not enjoy this instead go watch the original again or play the 2009 game it is the closest thing to a third ghostbusters movie that we will ever get
Jul 15 2016,negative,i saw the new ghostbusters on opening weekend 715  while i like the cast from snl this really falls flatter than leslie jones on the floor
Jul 15 2016,negative,absolutely terrible do not give these people your money
Jul 15 2016,negative,i went last night at the 930  premier   they were expecting a big turn out and made me pick a seat but there was only 25 people that showed up and i theater that could seek 70   halfway through the movie 20 people got up and left and i was about to too  i thought to myself ive already paid for the ticket i mite as well keep watching this train wreck of a movie  i tell you if i really want to go watch haunted mansion i wouldve went and watched it instead zoo shameful and utter bs of a movie called ghostbusters  i dont know if the movie was trying to be a comedy or a whore movie but it done neither of these things  when the movie was over the last thing i seen before i walked out the door was for  harold ramis  you could have put in loving memory of him or we lost a great man or ghostbuster but no  i know herald would probably be rolling in his grave right now   it showed that the budget of this movie was 144 million dollars i guarantee you the movie will probably not even made 100 million in my eyes and a lot of other  fans and people that have grown up knowing the original ghostbusters movies and cartoons show this movie never happened  sony pictures  for ruining a spiderman franchise and now you jump onto the ghostbusters bandwagon fuck you  dont waste your money watching this piece of crap movie if you really want to see it just wait for it to come out on redbox youre only gonna end up spending a dollar or two
Jul 15 2016,negative,jumbled mess with crass humor we get a queef joke within the first 15 mins an incomprehensible and cheap climax lackluster cameos from actors who look entirely not interested in being there an insult to the original in every way helmed by an asshole director to top it off avoid
Jul 15 2016,positive,dont compare this to the orginal this movie stands alone just fine fun movie surprisingly it had a plot kate mckinnon stole the show post credit scene was awesome
Jul 15 2016,negative,horrible   that i chuckled a couple of times that these are comedians and they had some funny lines  here and there  but even a broken clock is right 2 times a day  this was just not enough   it was not funny enough  it was not clever enough and it really fails on so many level
Jul 15 2016,positive,entertaining cast chris hemsworth is wasted in a poorly written role the film is stolen by leslie jones who has most of the best lines and kate mckinnon who is zany and overthetop without becoming too cartoonish although she has a habit of mumbling her lines the visual effects are very colorful with lots of neon greens blues pinks and purples the 3d is very effective this is immersive 3d with a lot of eye candy kids should enjoy this although the comedy is somewhat ribald at times it doesnt take itself as seriously as the original two did but it is nevertheless a fun and enjoyable two hours worth seeing
Jul 15 2016,positive,superbly cast hilarious female ensemble even chris hemsworth was superb i laughed hard throughout aykroyd and murray cameos were kind of bad but it was a pretty awesome flick all in all misogynists go eat ectoplasmic slime
Jul 15 2016,positive,while the new ghostbusters is not nearly as good as the original it does manage to stand on its own for starters the entire cast is very talented i even thought kate mckinon was good in the movie she just seemed very out of place her character and chemistry with the other actresses does not really work at all kate mckinon acted well although this was just not the right movie for her to be in also the comedy worked quite well throughout the entire movie although the only problem with the comedy in this movie is that most of it is att he beginning  at around the second half mark the jokes still hit well they are just few and far between also chris hemnsworth was great for the most part in the movie although his characters stupid act does begin to ware on throughout the film the story is very solid the only problem i had with it was the villain he was kind of a toss away villian that was not really needed the movie is called ghost busters just have them fight ghosts overall i though the movie was good and enjoyable even though it does have some problems
Jul 15 2016,negative,straight trash a horrible movie and such a sad attempt of a remake filled with pc and sjw undertones
Jul 15 2016,negative,this movie was really bad no character arcs annoying characters terrible dialogue the movie has random scenes that just make no sense just to force a payoff just because someone had a bad day new weapons was made by jilian some random scene with weapons the nuclear reactor on top of the car was just so obvious that it would be the final thing to take the final ghost down     in the first ghost with people clearly taking selfies with the ghost there was no idiot filming it i know its a movie but trying to force social media into the film while it not being on their side at any point is just counter productive they should have just kept the whole social media thing out    on the brighter side the sound was good and i think the cinematography was decent as were the effects so thats why im giving it a 155 and not a 05
Jul 15 2016,negative,this movie was terrible unfunny and the worst paul feig movie
Jul 15 2016,positive,ghostbusters 2016 is a bittersweet pill to swallow while i enjoyed the movie its existence is a cruel reminder that ill never see a proper sequel to the 1984 original gb2 was a lazy remake of the first one imo i always hoped to see one more film with the original characters alas i never will but that doesnt mean i cant enjoy this new film while its very evidently a remake the cast of characters arent just female versions of their male counterparts all four actresses bring a unique spin to their parts and play off each other well my favorite of the four was kate mckinnons jillian holtzmann she just seemed to be having a blast every second of her screen time the biggest criticism i have of the movie is that its very much a clone of the original films plot down to the climax also the villain is underwhelming rowan is basically a stereotypical angry nerd who lives in a basement and is mad at the world for being bullied by it
Jul 15 2016,negative,massive pile of shit
Jul 15 2016,negative,it is an insult to the actorsactress s talent in this movie moronic and stereotypical characters poorly written bad cgi low brow humor
Jul 15 2016,positive,hilarious thanks to extremely talented cast  so worth seeing 
Jul 15 2016,negative,just a really bad movie i think the writing  was poor and 0 character development
Jul 15 2016,negative,the movie was incredibly sexist and condescending towards men as a whole an occasional jab here and there is funny but when a good eighty percent of the movie is directed at man hating it just got old and it got old fast there were some great upsides to the movie and those moments were predominately occupied by chris hemsworth stereotypes and sexist banter galore on display unfortunately instead of what could have been a unique and fantastic reboot that just happened to star strong female leads
Jul 15 2016,positive,from funny to suspenseful scenes ghostbusters gives an unforgettable performance       from opening to closing scenes the cast has the whole theater laughing uncontrollably from the mature and not so mature jokes the cast of jones mccarthy mckinnon and wiig bring the charisma and spunk a summer blockbuster film has been waiting for for many years     for the now adults who grew up with this film there is plenty of nostalgia throughout from cameos to hidden easter eggs along the way a trip down memory lane is fully promised      for the new generation of ghostbusters there is a two hour fun filled movie of jokes some may not be understandable for younger ones and plenty of spooky scenes to start a new fandom      the standout of this movie was in no doubt the magnificent kate mckinnon jillian holtzmann mckinnons character is the scene stealer with the humorous lines and a personality of a crazy but cool weirdo      highly recommend taking your children and anybody else you wish to experience this film
Jul 15 2016,positive,a fresh take on a well loved franchise  loved this movie it is funny great cast and a smart script
Jul 15 2016,negative,garbage cashin on the magic that was the original movies
Jul 15 2016,negative,dont go wast ur money dont see it
Jul 15 2016,positive,is it perfect nope just like the original its a fun movie for the family doesnt deserve the hate the internet is giving in such a lackluster summer season ghostbusters provides the fun this season needs gonna watch it again
Jul 15 2016,negative,its unbelievably bad  its a laughable joke made by people who are not fans of the original  theyre essentially insulting anyone and everyone who is a fan of the original    its a mess production wise the jokes are at a nonstopmachinegunpace and theyre all cringe and awful      this film is an embarrassment to behold  the performances are all forced and theyre all in on the joke make it further unbelievable    the villain is a glossedover example of the worst kind of writing  his motivations are nonexistent his abilities are not explained properly  he can control the minds and bodies of anyone in the final battle except the main 4 women it makes no sense what so ever and anyone who refutes you on this will just say its a movie about ghosts none of it makes sense which is a shit way of creating an excuse for unbelievably amateur writing    couple all of this with how badly sony marketed the film bashing the franchises fans bashing men in general and sticking to their guns on just how awful of a product theyve created here      thsi entire thing has been the most embarrassing circus of a film i have ever seen in my life    110
Jul 15 2016,negative,the good news is that the movie isnt as bad as the trailers made it out to be the bad news is that its still what was expected how come cameos are the best thing about this movie it cant stand on its own it isnt even funny how can you make a movie without one laugh in it at least its watchable
Jul 15 2016,negative,legitimately awful everything good about the original is nowhere to be seen in this film dont waste your time and money on this horrid film
Jul 15 2016,negative,firstly sony obviously payed the critics to write good reviews this movie is pure shit
Jul 15 2016,negative,saw it thursday night with the wife how the hell is this cgi qweef fest getting a fresh rating i think the scooby doo movies were playing better in the same teritory yes seriously its that bad it ranks down there with pixels and the eddie murphy haunted mansion its all crude clumsy fart joke level humor and snl3 stooges slapstick none of the clever verbal humor that we got from the originals i would say this was meant to be a kids movie but i cant believe anyone thinks kids are this stupid but hey if you want to take your incredibly stupid kid and teach them the all important message men suck kick em in the dck via a neon green seizure inducing hash of cgi by all means enjoy yourself anyone not tripping on ritalin will find this movie unbearable even the normal foul mouthed and unwatchable melissa mccarthy is at best unbelievably boring in this one if you want to watch mccarthy bitch about wonton soup for an entire movie have a blast im trying to think of some positives to put in this review really really hard and nope still not getting any well at least it isnt longer is the best i could come up with i think the only possible fans or audience for this movie are 7 year old female three stooges fans everybody else will find it unbearable actually taking children to watch this might be construed as child abuse in some localities play it safe and take the kiddies to the pets movie instead
Jul 15 2016,negative,bad really bad painfully unfunny painfully uninteresting action painfully boring this movie is just painful and no it does not make you a misogynist to hate this movie it makes you a person with a  brain if you want to support movies that are actually progressive do that but dont support this shameless exploitation of gender politics 210 you done made me angry
Jul 15 2016,positive,it isnt as good as the original but it is better than ghostbusters 2 the character portrayals were better than i expected and i like the nods to the original while separating itself from the original
Jul 15 2016,positive,i thought it stood very well on its own  the character development arcs and overall writing was great  even the cameos from the original cast did a great job  everyone in the theater laughed at each one
Jul 15 2016,positive,was a fun movie but could be choppy in places and not perfect by any means had plenty of laughs though if you go in already not liking the idea best to skip it overall movie was a lot of fun
Jul 15 2016,positive,pretty solid comedy not as good as the original but no one was expecting it to be it landed about 75 of its jokes which is awesome and the special effects looked great it delivered
Jul 15 2016,positive,this was much better than i had expected  it holds up well to the original but starts a bit slow  however my 10 and 12 year old boys liked it more than the original
Jul 15 2016,negative,the film feels like a collection of scenes poorly put together rather than a single entity and the almost constant references to better movies just highlight how weak this one is  the 3d and special effects are truly superb to look at and the plot has enough variety to keep it watchable with a couple of nice references to the original  however the humour is mostly flat and not funny relying on immature or slapstick gags  the characters dont have much depth and although hemsworths performance is great his character is too annoying to enjoy
Jul 15 2016,negative,geez this was terrible bad acting bad jokes bad writing how the critics can like this movie is way beyond me
Jul 15 2016,negative,this movie if it was not linked to a major institution the original good ghostbusters and if it was not politicized by angry unattractive feminists would be absolutely destroyed by critics  from its bad predictable cannedhumor to its poor acting and generally untalented cast to its awful screenwriting the movie was awful  if you arent into romantic comedies which if you like the original ghostbusters you arent you will despise this horrendous refuse
Jul 15 2016,positive,i had more fun watching the new ghostbusters than i have had watching anything else all year better plot more science funnier and the action scenes actually worked imho there were cameos and head nods and lots of applauds at the end as well as hooting and laughter and shrieking from the audience throughout    and yes guys thats how it feels to be constantly sexualized and overlooked in movies     honestly they turned a lot of tropes on their heads and made some really valid points about life as a woman without ever actually making any effort at it or being preachy like dress code conundrums how women make it through life getting overlooked or made fun of without turning homicidal etc
Jul 15 2016,negative,worst movie in the past 20 years
Jul 15 2016,negative,just watch the angry joe review it is a pile of shit movie
Jul 15 2016,positive,not rubbish not amazing but fun the female characters outshine the male characters by a mile not sure if it was done on purpose but all the male performances seemed rather lazy   still looks great sounds great and the fx are pretty good  thoroughly enjoyable and worth watching  oh and i loved the cameos
Jul 15 2016,positive,much better than all the negative hype surrounding it yes it cannot stand with the original movie and does try too hard to reference its 1984 counterpart but the main woman are funny and most of the jokes land well my 5 8 and 10 year old girls loved it and we are seeing it again tonight mckinnon steals the show but the chemistry between the others is great i dont know how some reviews says there is none they make a great team
Jul 15 2016,negative,women should not have a leading role
Jul 15 2016,positive,excellent movie lots of nods to the old cast and stories the movie couldve used another 1530 minutes to explain things better but overall still a great movie
Jul 15 2016,positive,went to a late showing on a work night when i was already felling tired and the movie kept me awake  its not a great movie but it is a good movie  not a big crowd for opening night so the marketing has not generated good buzz the trailers were awful the tv spot were awful but the movie itself is good and pretty funny with a couple of scary moments
Jul 15 2016,negative,pace is terrible in this movie all actors where playing stereotypes badly very little humour to be found which is bad considering this is supposed to be a comedy it just fails on all levels i was really hoping this would be good since the reviews where good but the reviews where dead wrong i feel most of these good reviews are in support of the all female cast i dont care about gender a bad performance is a bad performance an poor movie is a poor movie and this is poor its scored better than 2 but 2 is more fun than this wait until its on tv
Jul 15 2016,positive,funny funny funny its not about the plot its about the jokes
Jul 15 2016,negative,ok this movie is just awful  it could have been good  no doubt the female cast and others in this movie have talent but the story and plot the writing act 3 is a trainwreck nothing good here people unless you are a complete idiot  this is what this movie caters to idiots  the jokes if you can call them that 8090 of them fall flat  i did not find this movie at all funny  it wipes the slate clean as if the other ghostbuster movies didnt exist  this is hugely insulting given the large fanbase  do not go see this movie only thing i would say is that the cast are talented its not about that you godamn sjw trying to say that it is  this movie is poorly constructed boring lowbrow humor and not worth paying for  you will forget this movie in a month  go see the secret life of pets if youre looking for a quality family movie  anything but this crappy trashy cash grab from a known studio that is stuck in the dark ages ruining franchise after franchise just to make a buck sony  this movie could have been good  it simply isnt
Jul 15 2016,neutral,the special effects were great but i never really felt like the characters melded  chris hemsworth beautiful blond act was mindless and not that entertaining  also felt like the director put way too many homages into this film to acknowledge the original  it just didnt click for me and i am not a fanboy of the original
Jul 15 2016,negative,it came off as a spoof movie and such a waist of what could of been
Jul 15 2016,negative,very disappointing movie not because the caste was all female but because it just dragged on and made little sense
Jul 15 2016,positive,very good dont let the haters ruin this for you not everyone has the same taste in movies and im sure a ton of people will like this its a good and funny movie the only problem was that in a few parts they were not funny and they tried too hard to be other than that it was good just dont go watch it with such a negative attitude and watch as its own film dont compare it to the old one
Jul 15 2016,negative,fart  is from the front  really thats the comedy in this movie i think this is what represents the whole movie 
Jul 15 2016,positive,two things drew me to this movie one being the absolutely starstudded cast of leading ladiesbeing some of the best female comedians working today in the same vein as the original cast two being the idea of it a comedyaction movie with a mostly female cast where the maledominated status quo especially for the original film was overturned but seeing it not only did i find the writing chuckleworthy at best and tiresome at worst but it was doomed from the start to never really measure up to the original which was and is a cinematic classic and would have been hard to do justice even if the movie was a resounding success the kevin being stupid jokes were obvious and overplayed just a few too many times for me and even if they werent none of them were really that funny to begin with and sometimes it seemed like the film was more an interconnected series of skits than a flowing story the cameos from the surviving original cast  were welcome but ultimately detracted from time they could and should have used to strengthen the storytelling and help scenes flow better with the cast and plot it really had a lot of potential but the lackluster script kept the comedic genius of the actors from shining through making this movie a solid meh
Jul 15 2016,positive,fun movie  fulla girl powerboys be hatin
Jul 15 2016,negative,could have been funnier perhaps poor editing led to a weaker story that seemed to disjointed besides the wiigs and mccarthys characters there seemed to be little character depth some of the funnier moments werent with the main group visually theres a lot of colors that just pop but its not enough to make it feel fun this seemed to be more of a remake of the real ghostbusters cartoon rather than the ghostbusters movie     spoiler alert    if you stay till after the credits you learn that the next movie night have zuul
Jul 15 2016,negative,horrible movie i do r recommend people to see it save your coins 
Jul 15 2016,positive,dont listen to the garbage trolls this movie was fantastic
Jul 15 2016,negative,might have been better if they made a sequel this adds nothing new and is yet another hollywood remoney remake ghostbusters 2 and this remake are an example of why the original is sometimes best left alone the characters were in the shadow of murray et al and would stand well on their own in another film where there werent  such huge boots to fill better luck next time please dont remake this remake
Jul 15 2016,positive,is it the best movie youll see this year definitely not but i laughed out loud enjoyed the ridiculous characters and am interested to see where they go with a sequel if they decide to make another which they left it wide open for 35 stars
Jul 15 2016,positive,loved it would definitely go see it again
Jul 15 2016,positive,absolutely love this movie love this 4 ladies they are amazing they made me laugh so much girlsrule ghostbusters
Jul 15 2016,negative,spoilers  the fact that the movie is absolutely terrible has nothing to do with the fact that they are women  it would not have been better if you threw in any four random male comedians   if you are an original ghostbusters fan you notice a major shift in the comedy style as the opening major joke comes in the form of a queef  youre hit repeatedly with toliet humor and rapid fire jokes that just never hit   honestly i cant imagine the original doing as well if it had begun with dumbed down like this  yes it could be a little crud at times but never so constant or over the top  it had a respectable amount of humor paranomral and even a bit realism to it    there are glaring plot holes through out the film the local govt who apparently knew of the existence of paranormal threats all along decides to confront the ghostbusters  they state to secretly stand with them and their efforts yet go so far out of their way to promote them as frauds  knowing that this could easily dead stop their business and drive them into poverty  so no they gave them no financial backing or even positive public support knowing that they were the only ones with the technology that could deal with this type of issue  it would be like putting out a large bonfire when you know there could be a pending attack of traditional scarecrows filled with dry hay  this is a stark contrast to the original movie where there was obvious disbelief and skepticism  yet the moment there the paranormal was proven the original ghostbusters had instant support from all local authorities which made logical sense  even when the 16 ghostbusters have defeated the threat the city officials still fight against them and downplay the entire city wide event  how could they deny that  did no one in the city pull out a cell phone and snapchat a video of the dead flying around  even if the spirits didnt branch across the entire city you had at least near a million people that witnessed the event  in a world of social media the primise that the local govt could keep a lid on it all is ridiculous     rowan the villain makes little to no sense  hes a bell hop that just so happens to be a bullied super genius that somehow figures out to bring ghosts into the world of the living  yet his reasons and follow through seem almost cartoonish not a pun at the fact he literally turns into a cartoon near the end   the power he gains from killing himself makes no sense  they dont even attempt to shed any light as to how he learned to possess humans control an army of ghosts control the actual army and shape shift into a giant creature  yes we seem a childish and crude drawings he made in a book  however he never see something akin to a satans bible or necronomicon that would have gifted him with abilities like that of gozer from the original ghostbusters   gozers powers never really required an explanation because it was a fucking god  nuff said  lets ignore how the origins of those powers for my minds sake  anyways rowan has these powers and apparently wants to hurt and torture everyone that he comes across because wah bullies   so what does he decided to do with them   he actually takes over the body of a ghostbuster and fails to destroy their equipment  he could have just killed the one ghostbuster he was inhabiting or apparently controlled them all with no effort  there was nothing stopping him from doing so  instead he just flees in a different meat suit just to further his stupid plan all so he can get his nonexistent ghost balls blown off rowan just lacks any believably or actual intelligence   while were on that subject          practically every male is on at least some level of basic stupidity and below  its funny how this movie received so much apparent hate about the female cast  only to go out of its way to take pop shots at men  this goes especially for chris hemsworths character kevin  he is so unbelievably stupid that i refuse to believe that he can function in human society  despite his stupidity kevin can design one original logo for his presentation yet cant figure out a freakin telephone  he is easily the male equivalent of the ditsy big breasted blonde stereotype weve seen in the so many movies  i could say that this felt extremely out of place if i were talking about the 84 film but i guess it works if works for this particular crapfest          the cliched stereotypes didnt stop with kevin  the character patty was straight up racist and theres no way around that  in a group full of highly educated white females she is reduced to the horribly overused loud sassy and street wise black chick the writers even make patty play the race card when she jumps into a crowd only for everyone to move out of the way  winston may have been a more minor character but he was still strong and fleshed out never once using his race to force a laugh the amount of knowledge she knows about the city borders on a google search level  if she had mentioned she had a minor in history or even a job as a tour guide i would have believed that she could possess some historical knowledge about particular areas  yet she manages to spit out info at random times that are far too convenient to the story  patty adds little to the actual group beyond that except to point out obvious issues that the rest of the group allows to fall through their capable hands  this is extremely evident at the very end of the credits when patty listens to the evps and pulls zuul out of everything she was listening to  if this was important how on earth could two seasoned paranormal experts miss this    finally you have the major letdown of the film the cameos made by the original cast  instead of having murray aykroyd hudson etc reprise their roles they are reduced to awkward insanely short pop ins  while some see this as the film paying homage to the original this feels more like a failed attempt to appease ghostbusters fans  this could have easily been a passing of the torch film even if the originals had only been used for a short period of time in the beginning  they could have even been killed off and the women could have been the ones to take up the fight  hell that would have made the technology jump holtzman did in the movie actually make freakin sense  bill murrays character was probably the biggest let down of the entire movie for me  he portrays a paranormal critic that lives to debunk and pester ghost experts  hes cold mean and to the point  this mirrors the role of walter peck from the 84 film and i believed that wed see him refute their claims throughout the story  yet he is killed off before we feel any real impact and it was such a huge waste      i could easily go on with the problems i have with the movie but lets wrap this up  what pisses me off the most about the entire ordeal is that you have the production company and individuals brain washed by them that have attempted to turn any and all negative views about the film into antifeminism propaganda  the initial hatred for this film stemmed from comments that called them out for over using cgi comedy style used and the fact that this was a reboot  sony went straight to defcon 1 and became to delete comments by the truckloads to try and save face  however during the massive damage control they figured out a way to give themselves a positive spin on everything  the minuscule amount of sexist comments were brought to light and used fuel a gender war simply to sell tickets  all to mask a failed attempt of a movie

    the cliched stereotypes didnt stop with kevin  the character patty was straight up racist and theres no way around that  in a group full of highly educated white females she is reduced to the horribly overused loud sassy and street wise black chick the writers even make patty play the race card when she jumps into a crowd only for everyone to move out of the way  the amount of knowledge she knows about the city borders on a google search level  if she had mentioned she had a minor in history or even a job as a tour guide i would have believed that she could possess some historical knowledge about particular areas  yet she manages to spit out info at random times that are far too convenient to the story  patty adds little to the actual group beyond that except to point out obvious issues that the rest of the group allows to fall through their capable hands  this is extremely evident at the very end of the credits when patty listens to the evps and pulls zuul out of everything she was listening to  if this was important how on earth could two seasoned paranormal experts miss this    finally you have the major letdown of the film the cameos made by the original cast  instead of having murray aykroyd hudson etc reprise their roles they are reduced to awkward insanely short pop ins  while some see this as the film paying homage to the original this feels more like a failed attempt to appease ghostbusters fans  this could have easily been a passing of the torch film even if the originals had only been used for a short period of time in the beginning  they could have even been killed off and the women could have been the ones to take up the fight  hell that would have made the technology jump holtzman did in the movie actually make freakin sense  bill murrays character was probably the biggest let down of the entire movie for me  he portrays a paranormal critic that lives to debunk and pester ghost experts  hes cold mean and to the point  this mirrors the role of walter peck from the 84 film and i believed that wed see him refute their claims throughout the story  yet he is killed off before we feel any real impact and it was such a huge waste      i could easily go on with the problems i have with the movie but lets wrap this up  what pisses me off the most about the entire ordeal is that you have the production company and individuals brain washed by them that have attempted to turn any and all negative views about the film into antifeminism propaganda  the initial hatred for this film stemmed from comments that called them out for over using cgi comedy style used and the fact that this was a reboot  sony went straight to defcon 1 and became to delete comments by the truckloads to try and save face  however during the massive damage control they figured out a way to give themselves a positive spin on everything  the minuscule amount of sexist comments were brought to light and used fuel a gender war simply to sell tickets  all to mask a failed attempt of a movie       terrible crude comedy that uses quantity or quality  horrible misuse of cameos  there are too many plot holes to begin to name  feels more like pixels style movie than anything deserving the ghostbusters name
Jul 15 2016,positive,i dont know why everyone is giving this movie bad reviews i know it all started with horrible comments on youtube but i think thats all unfounded    the movie was quite fun and enjoyable there was just enough references from the first movie to give some nostalgia but yet this movie stood on its own     please dont pay attention to all the reviews go see this for yourself and just have a good time
Jul 15 2016,positive,i loved it it had me and everyone around me in tears laughing great movie
Jul 15 2016,negative,a movie that purposely kills the original ghostbusters and then steps on its grave
Jul 15 2016,negative,this film was pretty much terrible i am glad i had free tickets i really just wanted some popcorn this ruined the franchise
Jul 15 2016,negative,the new ghostbusters movie felt like a gender swapped version of a forgettable adam sandler romp every joke was either ripped from the original movies or simply a obvious gender joke every action scene felt like a cheap video game boss fight or cutscene the gadgets were horribly put together worse than a kids halloween costume the ecto1 could have been put together in a home depot parking lot  it was entertaining enough to go direct to netflix but in no way should be linked to the original awesome films
Jul 15 2016,negative,words cannot describe the pain or the cringe
Jul 15 2016,positive,loved it what a fun funny movie it was so entertaining and such a fun spin on a classic 
Jul 15 2016,positive,fantastic reboot  superb cast and great cameos its the typical ghostbusters storyline through fresh eyes the effects were great much better than the cheesy effects in the original  lots of laughs and the action was great  dont listen to the i liked the original naysayers they probably didnt like batman begins either
Jul 15 2016,neutral,nothing really offensivei didnt hate it 510
Jul 15 2016,positive,by far better than the second one
Jul 15 2016,positive,absolutely loved this movie funny smart great nods to all previous cast members 
Jul 15 2016,negative,where to star from the bad humor to the constant attack to men on this movie this end been a terrible reboot and end been sexiest movie against men for some strange reason
Jul 15 2016,negative,this movie is very ironic in the sense that it is in fact more sexist than the fanbase that shunned it all men are portrayed as stupid and useless which is absolutely wrong the hate was welldeserved nobody who is actually nonsexist would want to see this
Jul 15 2016,negative,a few laughs but mostly cringes
Jul 15 2016,negative,not good at all chris we get ur trying to be dumb not funny skip go to see the infiltrator
Jul 15 2016,positive,loved it better than the original go see it
Jul 15 2016,positive,as the prophetess taylor swift has taught us haters gonna hate hate hate hate hate baby and there was plenty of prerelease hate for the mid2016 comedy reboot ghostbusters pg13 156 starting when its allfemale cast was announced in early 2015 there seems to be multiple sources of this antireboot prejudice for starters it gives many movie fans pause when they learn that a beloved film from their younger years such as 1984s ghostbusters is being remade that concern compounds when filmmakers announce major changes coming to the remake such as changing the gender of the four main characters from male to female but most of the vitriol seemed focused just on the fact of the core cast being females that aspect of the backlash calls to mind tina feys constant annoyance at suggestions that women arent as funny as men as she explains in her bestselling 2011 comical autobiography bossypants criticism spread even though the cast of 2016s ghostbusters includes the very popular melissa mccarthy and some of the most prominent and most valuable saturday night live cast members from the previous decade  regardless of gender the internet trolls would have been welladvised to withhold judgment this is an excellent remake which stands on its own merits    2016s ghostbusters is a remake that is not simply a retread  and pays appropriate homage to the original this film changes the gender of the main characters and only keeps the basic setup of the original  but also gets nostalgic with several significant details fresh cameo appearances by most of the main actors from the 1984 version some memorable 80s music and ray parker jrs iconic theme song    erin gilbert kristen wiig is a professor at columbia university who has a skeleton in her closet but not a ghost that comes later her reputation and her bid for tenure at columbia is threatened by a book that she wrote back in college with classmate abby yates melissa mccarthy in the book the two indulge in their mutual interest in the paranormal by making theoretical claims about the existence of ghosts at this particularly auspicious moment in erins career abby tries to resurrect sales of their book by making it available on the internet erin finds abby pursuing her paranormal research at a rather unsophisticated educational institution across town and working with brilliant but quirky engineer jillian holtzman kate mckinnon hoping to get abby to take the book off the internet erin agrees to introduce abby and holtzman as everyone calls her to the owner ed begley jr of an old new york mansion and the mansions tour guide zach woods who claims he encountered a malevolent spirit    one thing leads to another not wanting to give away too much here and the three women open up a research facility to investigate claims of paranormal activity in the big apple they hire a receptionist named kevin chris hemsworth a dimwitted but handsomebuff young man who is the only one dumb enough to apply for the job but also too dumb to do it properly when erin abby and holtzman investigate a ghost sighting in a subway tunnel they meet friendlysmarttough metropolitan transit authority worker patty tolan leslie jones who joins the club and becomes the fourth ghostbuster    with erin and abbys academic expertise holtzmans ingenuous but dangerous gadgets and pattys encyclopedic knowledge of the city and a hearse from her uncles funeral home becoming the new ecto1 the four women uncover and fight against a plot to unleash ghosts of residents from new yorks long and diverse history onto the unsuspecting city but before the ghostbusters can save the city from becoming one big haunted house they have to get past a paranormal debunker bill murray plus a comically selfcentered mayor andy garcia and his equally politicallymotivated advisor cecily strong not to mention a couple clueless homeland security agents matt walsh and michael kenneth williams its all good the four women at the center of this movie aint afraid of no ghosts  or haters      2016s ghostbusters is fresh and very enjoyable the changes work well and the new cast works even better in my humble opinion these are the best roles for mccarthy and wiig since they starred together in 2011s bridesmaids while mckinnon and jones shine in their biggest bigscreen roles to date hemsworths character is good for more than a few laughs although some of them are a little too far on the silly side and deadpool fans will enjoy seeing karan soni in several scenes as a barelycompetent food delivery man director paul feig who also cowrote with katie dippold gives us just the right blend of the old and the new with however a couple awkward moments mixed in and makes very good use of the significant advances in visual effects in the over three decades since the original    if the original ghostbusters was a great guy movie as some see it then the 2016 version with its core female cast and their receptionist being played as a hunky dumb blonde male then this remakereboot is ghostbusters for women but thats only one way of thinking because this film is bigger than all that 2016s ghostbusters is a fun funny movie that updates the 1984 classic for a new generation  and is very entertaining in its own right not in spite of the cast but because of them a
Jul 15 2016,positive,very entertaining and funny the original wasnt laugh out loud hilarious anyways so anyone whos analyzing the jokes in the reboot compared to the original need to just relax the visuals in this reboot were very inventive and well done
Jul 15 2016,positive,very funny not like the original but i really enjoyed it
Jul 15 2016,negative,it just missed on so many marks im so sad it ended up being this bad
Jul 15 2016,negative,not as good as the original movies this movie had way to much cgi the intire movie is special effects and the ghosts are too bad movie
Jul 15 2016,positive,the one thing i like about this movie is kate mckinnon for me she made the movie a bit better with all the hype of people saying this movie was going to be no good it was way better than i thought it would be but saying that it still was not super good what i like about it is some of the special effects work the colors of the ghosts were pretty cool i grew up with the original movie and love that the most but for me i still think its better than ghostbusters 2
Jul 15 2016,negative,i honestly dont know how anyone can think this movie was funny i dont really care that much for ghostbusters 1 so im judging this movie on its own merits     people call this a popcorn movie  i couldve bought popcorn for cheaper someplace else and whats up with all the man bashing women can only be seen as capable or strong when surrounded by men who are idiots or aholes    the fx were bleh the story unforgetable why did this movie need to exist     wait for the dvd dont waste money on a hd version if you really need to watch this
Jul 15 2016,positive,this movie was a lot of fun the comedy is well timed and i had a blast
Jul 15 2016,neutral,could and should have been much better a mediocre paul feig comedy
Jul 15 2016,negative,not sure how this is getting positive reviews other than paid people by sony to do it this movie was garbage it is ironic because sony was accusing all of the people criticizing the movie to be just misogynists this was one of the most misandrist movies ive ever seen every male in the movie was an idiot a bad guy or a complete jerk the final boss was even killed by being shot in the privates which are assumed that he is a male the cameos were disrespectful to the old cast and i would more compare the characters and the effectsto the cartoon version there were a few funny moments but that was lost due to overdone stereotypes such as the angry black woman with attitudevery overdone effects and the film doesnt even follow its own rules in regards to how the ghosts are dealt with trust me on thisdont see it wait for redbox or netflix
Jul 15 2016,negative,forgettable summer reboot mildly amusing
Jul 15 2016,positive,gb is a great fun movie with true laugh out loud moments
Jul 15 2016,negative,what the fuck is this garbage 
Jul 15 2016,positive,ghostbusters manages to capture the same magic as the 1984 film by blending true creepiness with ohmyzuulicantbreathe laughter  read my full review at  
Jul 15 2016,negative,poor excuse of a film dont watch this movie if you enjoy life
Jul 15 2016,positive,great reboot cast was amazing and cameos were fantastic i dont know why people are giving it such negative reviews bunch of sticks in the mud of you ask me go see it
Jul 15 2016,neutral,i said i wouldnt judge it until i saw it now i have seen it ghostbusters isnt good but it isnt a garbage fire either you have four very funny women cues tyra banks i was rooting for you meme in an unfunny movie the biggest problem is we have an unnecessary yet direct remake plot and all of a film that is supposed to be a whole new world that has never heard of ghostbusters if its a new cinematic universe why are  we shoehorning in forced cameos from people in the originals as different characters taking you out of the world they are trying to build while in one way you could say it honors the original films its kind of disrespectful at the same time to them by not expanding upon what is already a part of pop culture why not do a passing of the torch storyline instead to respect the old films and build up the new film as this smart group of girls that kick ass     if youve never heard of ghostbusters you might like it and it isnt the worse way to spend your money at a theater this summer but it isnt a laugh a minute romp like other paul fieg directed films     the whole point of a remake existing is either a we can expand upon the mythos built by the original b translating an international property to the us for a potential larger audience or c we can make a better film than the original did the departed oceans eleven ect this just felt like an unnecessary cash grab that caused way too much online hate on four talented women its a solid c from me i didnt hate it but i didnt love it either so feel free to call me a misogynist internet but i had some issues with the new ghostbusters
Jul 15 2016,negative,this was paul feigs worst work i really wanted to like this movie and wish it was better
Jul 15 2016,neutral,it started off strong got silly around the time that bill murray makes his cameo in a scene with the ghostbusters then from that point it was a roller coaster of hits or misses    i give it a 25 because what i dont like about it cancels out what i do like about it putting it right in the middle
Jul 15 2016,positive,this was actually your run of the mill basic theater comedy but with a heavily star studded cast chris hemsworth was amazing in this as was kristen wiig i thoroughly enjoyed all the small quirky moments anyone else reviewing with excessive negativity are subtly or maybe not so much showing their misogyny and illogical basis of comparison its an okay movie nothing amazing nothing horrible but it was definitely fun
Jul 15 2016,positive,i like this new ghostbusters for 2 reasons 1 the new cast melissa mccarthy kristen wiig kate mckinnon leslie jones and chris hemsworth all do an awesome job in this remake 2 the special effects all of the cgi in this film is breathtaking all the ghosts in this film look really awesome when i walked into this film i thought i was going to be disappointed but when i walked out i was amazed before seeing this remake i watched the original film and i kind of didnt like it it was kind of boring and the special effects look too cheesy now im not saying i hate the original but it couldve been better in my opinion the remake i love there were some jokes that i was like really but the action was really cool and i understand that some people are going to comment saying so you like the remake you have no taste in film i can like any movie i want
Jul 15 2016,negative,the only reason these critics are giving this movie good reviews because they have a female cast there was no character development a terrible villain with a horrible motive unfunny jokes nauseating cgi its plot hole ridden and it gave a great disservice to the original with its halfbaked cameos all of these characters were stereotypes and screw girl power how about good story and writing power
Jul 15 2016,negative,the first part of the movie was alright but the rest of it failed the acting and the script were too forced and too stupid to sit through again
Jul 15 2016,positive,not bad for an origin story wonderful nostalgia and cameos from the original cast good humor just a really slow build to a really cool end but it still is hard to compete with the first ghostbusters
Jul 15 2016,positive,2016s ghostbusters isnt fantastic but it isnt terrible it had some fun moments some bad moments altogether was a fine little film the cast is fun even if im not a huge fan of all of them  leslie jones character was surprisingly good very different from the trailer even hemsworth who im not a gigantic fan of was great i actually liked the look of the ghosts as well the climax is fun though a bit predictable   the downsides include some of the lowestcommondenominator jokes a few scenes that definitely could have been cut and the villain  who is not great  if you seriously think this movie is destroying your childhood you need to take a step back and calm down
Jul 15 2016,negative,rancid and unfunny horribly written and even more poorly acted there so many good comedies featuring women  tis is not one of them
Jul 15 2016,negative,travesty of the highest order did not laugh once script was probably cobbled together 15 minutes before   the studio meeting misogyny is not the issuethe absence of substance and inspiration is actors were doomed to deliver dull clanky linessad
Jul 15 2016,negative,super cheesy and over the top graphics humor was weak
Jul 15 2016,positive,a wonderful performance with great timing and amazing cameos  only male tears here were tears of laughter  cant wait to see more from this team
Jul 15 2016,negative,i can only blame myself  we very rarely go out to the movies and when my wife and i were discussing what to watch i campaigned hard for this one  i knew it looked bad from the previews but forgot to disclose this information to my wife  she agreed and off we wenti just got back and had to write a review  this was awful  halfway through my wife leaned over to me and whispered your voting rights on future movies have been suspended  the cgi was way overused and amateurishit was just nonstop the acting was stiff the story was slow predictable and the comedywell there really wasnt any  it was like a really bad way too long snl skit  very depressing that i wasted my time on thisi had seen all the good reviews from critics here and was fool enough to believe themnow i think the studio just paid them off  if they guy who played thor hadnt been in it my wife would have walked out before it was over the ending was so lame we probably should have  avoid this like the zika virus
Jul 15 2016,negative,absolute trash an insult to the original in every way
Jul 15 2016,positive,it was amazing  hilarious and fun to watch  it did a great job of pay homage to the original while remaining its own movie  i loved the cameos
Jul 15 2016,negative,an insult to the original film also melissa mcarthy is one of the worst comedians of all time
Jul 15 2016,positive,fun smart with great critics about sexism and good references to the original movies i love it
Jul 15 2016,neutral,couple of not so funny jokes thats it
Jul 15 2016,negative,ok where to start i like chris helmsworth he was the only truly funny actor in this movie not funny enough to make it worth your money the original had a subversive charm to it this one is just dumb
Jul 15 2016,positive,the new ghostbusters is not nearly as terrible as the backlash from the initial reactions to this being made  granted it isnt paul feig and mccarthys best movie but its a fun and harmless time waster  like any good remakereboot it pays respect to the original with surprise cameos from the original cast and returning faces such as slimer and stay puft  with a bit of a shaky start some jokes are hit and miss  the end face off in nyc makes up for some of its short comings but end of the day ghostbusters isnt an amazing movie but it really isnt bad either
Jul 15 2016,positive,so good and so important women being awesome and smart and funny  the cameos felt forced but i get it
Jul 15 2016,negative,this move is a shameless cash grab that insults original fans and bores new ones it insults everybody as it prolongs sexist stereotypes against women and reinforce stereotypical portrayals of black women this feels like an snl skit that goes on too long sure there are a couple chuckles and i mean like maybe two or three but that cant save a broken plot and all of the rest of the flat jokes in between the movie has plot holes galore and often contradicts itself and changes how this ghostbuster universe works  skip this movie
Jul 15 2016,positive,this movie is hilarious the story is really good and the cast is perfect there was a single moment that felt a tad predictable but i feel like it didnt spoil the movie will definitely buy the movie when its out on bluray because i will watch this over and over
Jul 15 2016,positive,we saw this preopening night and it was awesome
Jul 15 2016,positive,loved it great performances by all smart joyful writing and really solid direction scifi elements got a little overly complicated to allow for more action which was great and that strained my suspension of disbelief but ultimately it was so much fun to watch that i didnt mind much
Jul 15 2016,negative,this is a spoof of a ghostbusters movie much more inline with scary movie and disaster movie than ghostbusters
Jul 15 2016,positive,i loved the chemistry the lead characters had with each other i was worried about the way the ghost were portrayed at first but once i got in the theater i was surprised on how scary they were at times my kid had to turn away from the screen a few times all in all a good movie i walked away happy with what was done with it
Jul 15 2016,positive,this reboot manages to be extra hilarious and extra scary than the originals while paying homage and respecting its source material i plan to see again
Jul 15 2016,positive,its  fun it doesnt deserve the hate that is getting because this movie is harmless so much harmless that is not great it just fun a flawed but ok popcorn the four leads save the day im interested in a sequel that doesnt pay to much honor to the original so it can be more of its own the 5 stars is not deserved but is only to make up for the 1 ratings
Jul 15 2016,positive,entertaining movie much better than expected
Jul 15 2016,positive,so i went to see the new ghostbusters last night and i can understand both the good and bad reviews at least some of them overall i give it a b maybe a b and this is mostly because it was a reboot of a classic as a stand alone movie it would be a solid b  things i liked the movie was fun it flowed well they had a good internal consistency the characters were memorable and very different from the original plenty of callbacks to the original and the cartoon the plot actually made sense why all this was happening  things i didnt like compared to the original they did not take it seriously in the original everyone played it straight in the reboot everyone is a bit zany it almost feels like they are trying too hard to prove that women can be funny the ghosts were too bright the ghostbuster equipment was not designed as well and yes i understand that this was on purpose there are exactly 0 quotable lines from the movie  all in all it is a completely different movie from a different time using some of the same ideas and it is a zany comedy instead of a straight comedy i would see it again and will see any sequels
Jul 15 2016,negative,i just saw this movie ghost busters is an obnoxious unfunny movie horrible improve three of the 4 characters are the same character there is no good timing or delivery it is just 4 women hanging out the ghost busting was meh it stumbled over its own continuity it was so lazy the villain is embarrassing whiny little shit every character is unbelievably stupid dumber then a bag of hammer i liked chris hemsworth he was funny with his troll acting but it was tragic if this was tropic thunder robert downey junior would tell him you dont go full retard literally the scene in the original where they turn on the proton pack for the first time is so much better as character development point and has more humor then this entire movie this movie was made by people who thought the funniest thing in the original was bill murray getting slimed i am going to repress it now
Jul 15 2016,negative,as a male ive been accused of being sexist whenever i criticize this movie the lack of cleverness heavy handed product placement and the weak villain played into my dislike however you didnt like an all female cast is the only reply i receive regardless of the points i try to make
Jul 15 2016,negative,if you like fart jokes queef jokes vagina jokes penis jokes and other forms of lowbrow comedy then this movie is just for you
Jul 15 2016,negative,mediocre movie same rehashed story with subpar cgi and hammy acting
Jul 15 2016,positive,ghostbusters was one heck of a movie experience great cast and epic ghostbusting scenes that will leave you in awe you have to go in as if you never heard of the original movies and dont compare this to the other two films yes you get your fun nods to those older classics mixed in with a fresh cast and great special effects that dont dissapoint  dont miss this wild ghost story on the big screen 5 really big stars
Jul 15 2016,neutral,ghostbusters 2 remake
Jul 15 2016,negative,its never boring but also rarely ever funny it feels less like a ghostbusters film and more like a paul feig movie it works better as a follow up to spy but also cant stop referencing the original ghostbusters with a gag or cameo almost every 1015 minutes the cast is probably the most enjoyable thing about the movie who you can tell are having a great time with this i think a lot of people will like this movie but i cant help but think about how much better it could have been
Jul 15 2016,neutral,pros  the acting was well done as expected from this starstudded cast   the story made sense it had a flow that felt nice with no incredible leaps between scenes and it gets a bonus point for the villain having an actual endgame  the cameos from the old cast were really fun and a nice wink at the audience  cons   the comedy was extraordinarily bad there was a joke here or there that was good but overall mostly gross out gags and semiracist slapstick   visually it looked like trash shiny ghosts bad slime effects and overdone cg to the point of excess  its horribly dated and probably wont hold up after 5 years minus a point for having fallout boy are they still around remake an iconic song poorly  overall  if you are really curious see it otherwise its not a great or even good reboot of the original and you probably should see finding dory for the fifth time
Jul 15 2016,positive,kate mckinnon is a show stopper   it had just enough to keep me interested and i had a lot of fun   ignore what you know about the original and let yourself enjoy it
Jul 15 2016,positive,funny and fresh  summer movie enjoyment loved it
Jul 15 2016,negative,absolutely terrible horrendous writing supremely unfunny cgi is atrocious dont care about the women leads its just a bad movie would be a bad movie with an all male cast
Jul 15 2016,positive,the ghosts were actually scary the comedy was hilarious and the busting action was great dont listen to the haters i loved this one way more original a brilliant successor more worthy of the moniker more almost everything else it shares it with
Jul 15 2016,negative,if you liked this new ghostbusters thats fine but i have to be honest with how the movie sat with me the humor and overall tone of the movie was about leslie nielson or national lampoon quality that may work for those other movies but it fell flat for a ghostbusters movie i couldnt stop cringing at all the stupid fart humor and dumb gags the effects were done in a very colorful scoobydoo style which i didnt care for no chemistry between the cast and a very very poor storyline  all and all it wasnt a well made movie and i laughed only twice    i have to say im shocked at the rating this movie has received how can two equally poor movies such as pixels and ghostbusters 2016 received completely different ratings why would pixels be rated as 16 on rotten tomatoes and ghostbusters 2016 a 73 theyre both bad movies and both deserve to be under 50 pixels should be around 45 and ghostbusters 2016 around 40 how can a movie so poorly written get good reviews answer me that spoiler the villain can incapacitate the entire police force and the army but not 4 ghostbusters thats a huge script problem and yes i said ghostbusters i didnt say 4 women or 4 men because the media needs to get off this gender kick if you actually watch the movie youll find script problems such as this throughout also a movie cannot stand on its own by constantly forcing cameos in my face get of it critics does an impressive job of standing on its own you say pathetic shameful you bunch of soulless sell outs
Jul 15 2016,negative,not family friendly and the jokes arent funny im not sure exactly who this movie actually is for  for an all female team theres a lack of girl power and the boob jokes get very very tiresome
Jul 15 2016,negative,what an incredible piece of garbage  first if your going to do a reboot then do a reboot  this movie pulled in so many elements from the first including using part of the soundtrack from the first one  i thought the plot was poor and the acting was lacking  hems worth made zero contribution to this farce
Jul 15 2016,negative,i wanted so bad to like it but it was so bad waste of time to see i feel
Jul 15 2016,positive,as someone who actual has seen the movie i really enjoyed it the original is clearly better but this movie works too
Jul 15 2016,positive,for the most part i enjoyed the movie it had a few notes where it was trying to feed off of the nostalgia of the originals but that was expected the third act felt a little rushed messy and obvious oh and now we will go fight the bad guy to save the city but that is an issue i feel many movies struggle with i was surprised how much i liked it since the trailers had me dredding it a friend insisted we go so i begrudgingly went actually ended up thanking her after the movie was done
Jul 15 2016,positive,it works way more than you think it would the cast is great and theres no way youre not having a good time not all the comedy hits but most of it does definitely worth seeing in theaters
Jul 15 2016,negative,an insult to ones intelligence and gender its view of men is misandrist its lack of jokes is confounding and the look and overall tone just doesnt jive with the past classics a complete and utter failure in every conceivable manner
Jul 15 2016,positive,this movie is laugh out loud funny from start to finish well paced well cast and super fun its a rare movie i would consider seeing twice and this is one of them  the film pays homage to the original appropriately while finding its own voice hilarious silly and absolutely worth seeing
Jul 15 2016,negative,set aside the politics of an all female cast since that shouldnt matter    this is  quite literally a train wreck at its finest very unfunny and just a subpar movie
Jul 15 2016,positive,while slightly faster paced to appeal to modern audiences it remains faithful to the feel of the original film and the cast does an excellent job of making this an very enjoyable film will possibly even see it twice really recommend you check this out if you enjoyed the original film 
Jul 15 2016,negative,i really wanted this to be good went to the 700pm imax 3d showing last night and was sorely disappointed all the things that made the first ghostbusters so great are gone from this movie you dont care about any of the characters there is no real charm or subtlety to a single performance these are just cartoon characters running around on the screen leveling up their weapons every 20 minutes the 3d was fantastic i loved how certain elements broke through the letterboxing and the special effects looked great but everything else was the worst case scenario
Jul 15 2016,negative,well i saw it i did the right thing and not deny my boy the chance to see ghost busters since its ment for his generation but im sorry that movie will never be the ghostbusters to me regardless of the name as my friend said today cant wait till they reboot this one again and call it the real ghostbusters to simply describe itif ghostbusters and scary movie the comedy had a baby this ghostbusters would be itan abomination
Jul 15 2016,positive,i loved this movie as a ghosthead and ghostbusters fan this is everything i love about it funny scary and fun great cast that carries the tourch in from 84 great director and great plot this movie cover all the gb universe from movies comics the video game and even the cartoon love it
Jul 15 2016,negative,the movie itself is not horrible not even that bad but just not that good either a lot of jokes feel flat and the theater was silent more than half the time the rolling credits moment was funnier than the actual movie with its impressive cast ghostbusters fails to fully deliver on its potential and finds itself tough to defend its existence as an extension of the series its not bad not good but just kind of there
Jul 15 2016,positive,funny movie definitely a good cast that works well together personally thought that kate mckinnon and leslie jones really blew it out of the water a good time
Jul 15 2016,negative,cheap potty humor  degrading men seems to be the trend  what was the point of the casting   dont waste your money
Jul 15 2016,negative,im sorry i wanted this movie to succeed but ghostbusters is a franchise that doesnt need to be remade sorry im not liking the movie at all its not even ghostbusters at all
Jul 15 2016,negative,is this new ghostbusters the worst movie in the world no is it good also no to be honest its not as bad as i expected it to be but its an unnecessary reboot with a halfbaked plot and a bunch of halfhearted jokes that dont really land kristen wiig does fine but kate mckinnons talents are almost entirely wasted this feels like a fanmade movie  full of cool special effects but no real substance
Jul 15 2016,negative,this movie was awful
Jul 15 2016,negative,whoa go see at your own risk for every good joke theres about 3 bad crazy things to cringe at
Jul 15 2016,negative,one of the worst films ever
Jul 15 2016,negative,i was really excited to see this so i went and watched the midnight showing last nighti am so disappointed and heartbroken that it wasnt very good a few laughs and a cool feeling of nostalgia cant keep this movie from being justwell not done very well lol i am one of a few hardcore fans of the orginals who probably supported this film and i feel betrayed because all my defense of it and arguments saying its going to be good and it was all for nothing because this is not a good movie at all 
Jul 15 2016,positive,haters be damned and those on the fence be assured the new ghostbusters is a worthy remake  like many of you i was hrm thats not really needed at the announcement wed get another installment of one of my first if not the first fandoms we all know how great the first ghostbusters from 1984 is  i watch it just about yearly and enjoy the hell out of it  ghostbusters ii is a film i will defend to the day i die and then the days after when i come back to drive wild cabs across new york my opinion on gbii may invalidate me for the rest of this review but despite being a softer copy of the original i still eat it up who doesnt love vigo screw it if you dont ghostbuster ii  everything you are doing is bad i want you to know that the cartoon was a favorite and it holds up as an adult due to a fantastic writing staff creature design and understanding of the film characters   ive been hesitant to want a ghostbusers iii during my adult life  it would be impossible for the same people to create the same energy that made bustin feel good twice before  the 2009 game was the closest wed get to that its a highly entertaining if not repetitive and short game  a worthy enough ghostbusters iii     that brings us to now it is 2016 and there is a brand new reboot of the series with new characters newish plot new writers and a new director  and you know what it works both as a remake and as its own film  ghostbusters strikes a balance between what worked before and new elements it neither copies 1984 outright nor takes the title and runs in a different direction like recent and excellent sequels star wars the force awakens and creed ghostbusters uses the bones of the first installment to make a new body the core of the originals is not the ghosts but the characters by way of dynamic personalities witty banter and how the react to the actual events that occur those actual events are the burned marshmallow on the cake this we have in droves ghostbusters is a comedy and its damned funny  its continually hilarious both in dialogue in physical comedy  although the dialogue and interaction based humor works better than the physical which sometimes too much slides into overlong slapstick  the characters are not direct copies of their predecessors even if one can see the basis of each some traits slide around or are merged  each of the four ghostbusters kristin wiig melissa mccarthy leslie jones and kate mckinnon have their times to shine and just about equal play  mckinnon is a scene stealer her line readings are wonderful and her reactions are even better   but she has a challenger in chris hemsworth as kevin the dimwitted mixture of janine tully and a little dana  hemsworth is worth is muscle weight in comedy gold  with taika waititi what we do in the shadows and hunt for the wilderpeople  two of my favorite comedies of the last two years holding the hammer for thor ragnarok can it just be an outright comedy and allow hemsworth to keep this up hes great at it  since were talking about actors and performances yes there are cameos from familiar ghostbuster faces more than youd think too and they all work fitting into the film and are very welcome     heres the biggest surprise there are many things that this version does better than the original  wow yes its true  this man has no dick sorry back to this movie  this a movie with ghosts based on horror elements  and there are times its actually a bit scary sequences designed to be horror not too scary  just enough that woman to my right was freaking out a little but the tone is there  particularly in the incredibly well constructed opening scene  by the time those familiar tones start to play the audience is ready to bounce their heads with a smile as the theme starts and in my audience they did  the ghosts in this version have bite they can hurt people and weirdly enough able to be affected by physical objects too  this creates higher stakes in each sequence and allows creative interactions of the living and the dead  these dangerous dead look great too  physical actors play the majority of the spirits and given cgi enhancements of glowing blue skeletal features and some rot they and the nonhuman ghosts are remincent of the create designs in the real ghostbusters cartoon along with mckinnons holtzmann echoing that shows egon  however there arent enough of them  missing is a montage of creative spirits  both in catching them in the 2nd act and when they expected activity bump in the finale  its understandable with the way the plot works though  the plotting 1984 is reactionary the ghostbusters have an event then figure out whats happening its a rather passive plot  2016 features a more directed but wider ranging plot with a human villain behind the mayhem who is followed so there more of a forward motion to the plot sorry guys badmouthing women being ghostbusters  the villain has mra qualities he hates everyone but has many barbs at women he actor of the villain a little weak and doesnt command much presence but its a welcome alteration     after all the waiting for many and hating for others ghostbusters is a strong new entry into a beloved franchise  the characters are fantastic the ghosts are well designed and sometimes scary there is a wellmade plot the cameos and in jokes are welcome and not awkward most importantly ghostbusters is a constantly highly enjoyable and continually hilarious film and i give it a very strong recommendation   
Jul 15 2016,negative,this was a horrible decision from the start it wasnt funny the humor was slapstickey and made for 5 year olds the cgi looked like the scooby doo movies and this was just an overall fail paul feig should be banned from hollywood what a horribly slow and boring story to boot the acting was beyond bad i had no idea wiig could be so boring mccarthy was her usual annoyingly loud self and they made the one black woman in the film act like a character from a tyler perry movie horrible just horrible all around
Jul 15 2016,positive,with all honesty this movie took me by surprise i though it was going to be very bad people will enjoy the movie especially with all the humor that each character brings the special effects were good especially if you will go watch it in 3d all the characters were well played and it is something different that in my opinion you cant compare to the original movie i liked the direction that this franchise is heading and it is something new for people to enjoy obviously there always mix feelings about the movie comparing to the one in 1984 if you have your doubts give it a try and judge the movie yourself
Jul 15 2016,negative,i no longer like ghostbusters as it is currently defined i loved bridesmaids but this movie is an unholy abomination that was made more as a social experiment than a good idea
Jul 15 2016,negative,this movie uses a lot of fart jokes is obnoxiously loud and it bashes men only because it doesnt know how else to praise women if i had to describe this movie with one word it would be uncreative mediocre of course does not excuse paul feigs and sony pictures disgusting behavior dont give them your money
Jul 15 2016,negative,this movie is pure crapavoid at all costs
Jul 15 2016,positive,loved every second of it it was hilarious it certainly doesnt deserve the amount of hate it has gotten i really enjoyed it give it a chance people
Jul 15 2016,positive,i have to admit i had low expectations about going to see this remakereboot of the franchise with all the negative press and concerns but i kinda of liked the movie yes it was a reimagination of the original it stated out slow and some of the humor was dry but as the movie went on it got better the unique off the screennot 3d scenes were a cool addition all of the original cast returned and they did dedicate the movie to harold ramis so all in all it was a good experience and i am glad i watched it it is worth checking out
Jul 15 2016,positive,this film was a great revival of a beloved franchise nodding to the original constantly while building the foundation for a new set of films to come
Jul 15 2016,positive,people are so butt hurt about this movie that they wont give it a chance even after its positive reviews the movie was great the comedy was great the new demographic on female characters made a nice reboot to a movie like ghostbusters people should honestly calm down and not judge a book by its cover
Jul 15 2016,positive,this movie defies the criticism  its not about the original at all and yet it gives beautiful nods to the franchise without bogging itself down with cameos and logistics  one minute its just a string of jokes and the next minute theyre running around the city full action movie style bustin ghosts  its brilliantly written incredibly cast and fantastically edited  you will not go wrong dropping some bills on this one
Jul 15 2016,positive,basically the perfect movie
Jul 15 2016,negative,waste of cameos by the original cast that had nothing to do with anything in the past movies  would have been better had they written it as if they were retiring and got these sorry girls as replacements  it was just bad  rent on redbox to see how bad it is then never see it again
Jul 15 2016,positive,dont let other influence your choice to see or not see the film i enjoyed myself from beginning to end
Jul 15 2016,positive,i loved it  and i love the original they are both amazing and funny movies
Jul 15 2016,negative,complete and utter unoriginal and above all very stereotypical bullshit movie that is very likely to get a lot of sequels because of paid critics and sjws
Jul 15 2016,positive,great reboot but some cameos seem strained and unnecessary  holtzman kate mckinnon needs a backstory
Jul 15 2016,negative,from the mediocre script to a practically completely undefined villain to jokes that fall flat at every corner the film is a trainwreck sony made an obvious quick cashgrab and attempt at a franchise and it did a horrible disservice to the original im fine with the new cast however holtzmann is far overacted to the point of being a cartoon character for the perfect comparisson of this film  match up the original mayor with this films mayor that is how drastically different this film is compared to the original
Jul 15 2016,positive,this was a fun addition to the ghostbusters franchise  i loved the cast and i really like how they stayed within the premise of the original movie but also did their own thing  leslie jones and chris hemsworth were hilarious  dan aykroyd was the producer and i really enjoyed the cameos of him and the remaining ghostbusters cast
Jul 15 2016,positive,kate mckinnon for jason bourne kate mckinnon for james bond kate mckinnon for president kate mckinnon for clares girlfriend
Jul 15 2016,negative,when you take the chance to dare remake or touch a cult classic well you better be prepared for comparison and as unbiased as the viewers may want to be here this remake lacks a strong storyline and charisma period it has few laughs but overall it is a big disappointment and it should reflect at the box office as i dont see strong word to mouth coming here imagine the first movie being a cool go cart race track and you get on your cart and race along a fun track with some daring passes and some fun hurdles and then imagine a simple bumper car ride this remake is just that a bumper car ride bouncing everywhere without any real direction the only true fun is the short cameos of bill murray and dan ackroyd
Jul 15 2016,negative,terribletotally disrespect the original copies the work of greater talents and misapplies it to this fraudulent cash grab     this movies has no depth no comedic value and no resonance millenials should love it
Jul 15 2016,positive,it was a fantastic movie  i couldnt wait to see it and it didnt disappoint
Jul 15 2016,positive,this movie was hilarious and delightful and has suffered immensely for no other reason that sexism people can call it whatever they want but that is the core reason behind everyones complaining i saw this last night and it was everything i wanted and more the girls were hilarious chris hemsworths character was hilarious and the whole thing was just fun and exciting its a hilariously fun addition to a film franchise that was supposed to be about exactly that  fun sadly i know the film is going to get reamed with a bunch of complaints that all boil down to the fact that they remade the film with women i will definitely be seeing it again and loving watching these women take on new york and busting ghosts
Jul 15 2016,positive,much much better than the trailers made it out to be i went in expecting bad adam sandler movie with horribly flat jokes but the comedy turned out to be the best thing about this movie and the four leads were excellent despite cartoonishness this was less of a ghostbusters remake and more of a the real ghostbusters tv series movie it helps that kate mckinnon is the spitting image of blonde egon    the story is messy the cgi reminds of scooby doo and there are quite a few scenes that just dont work but i laughed out loud quite a bit the performances were great chris hemsworth steals the show and the trailers really didnt this movie any favors
Jul 15 2016,positive,despite the negativity coming from the interwebs this movie is all of the funny it managed to pay tribute to the original but still be its own thing also kate mckinnon is everything go see it and enjoy
Jul 15 2016,positive,this movie was absolutely hilarious im a big fan of the previous ghostbusters but i love this one just as much the ladies are hilarious and the nods to the first ghostbusters makes it even better ignore other user ratings because they are just bitter over the trailer the movie is great just go see it
Jul 15 2016,positive,great reboot funny jokes good pacing and fun story  hemsworth was pretty to look at but detracted from the movie a little
Jul 15 2016,negative,wow this movie was a huge disappointment i didnt have high hopes going to see it but i thought that i might be surprised nope it sucked i dont understand how you could take such a great movie like the original with all of its great moments and then end up with this load of poop even the ghostbusters cartoon was ten times better than this   the only thing i liked watching was kate mckinnon she was cool i was even embarrassed to see the old ghostbusters make cameos in this movie such a let down 
Jul 15 2016,negative,ready set terrible
Jul 15 2016,negative,almost painful to sit through  although there were some funny parts for the most part i feel my time and money got wasted
Jul 15 2016,positive,es buena  pero kristen wight es un asco
Jul 15 2016,negative,honestly the worst comedy movie ive ever seen the jokes were garbage the plot is terribly written and so are the characters especially the villain and the movie is clearly pushing a feminist agenda which is utterly disgusting     dont trust the positive reviews theyre all either feminists and other sjw or paid shills this movie is complete garbage from start to finish and it deserves to bomb hard paul feig has never writtendirected a good comedy and he couldnt do that to even save his pathetic life
Jul 15 2016,positive,this movie was so very funny all the hate is underserved my entire theater broke out in gutbusting laughter several times
Jul 15 2016,positive,it was a good movie its not deserving of the hate and ridicule the cast was great the story was good the special effects were goos
Jul 15 2016,positive,being one of the few people super excited about this film from the very start i really tried my hardest to maintain an unbiased opinion when seeing ghostbusters the last thing i wanted to do was set myself up for heartachehell the first words out of my mouth when the sony logo appeared on screen were ok now im nervous    im happy to say that this movie was everything i wanted it to be and more it exceeded my expectations and im both excited and relieved    the chemistry with the main cast is what i call paired pairs mccarthy and wiig work really well together which i think thats due to their history together and mckinnon and jones  being current snl cast members  have worked out a beautiful ebb and flow about themselves the big question is do these pairs work well together and the answer is a strong yes as far as hemsworth is concerened  he surprised me with his comedic chops in vacation but i didnt know he could be this funny yeah thors got jokes    as far as the special effects are concerned  i honestly didnt think they were as cartoony as everyone complained about as a matter of fact most of the effects in the trailers were polished up in the final cut sure slimer and the final ghost did look overly cgi but i felt like it worked well enough to not detract from the story so long as you dont let it    and of course what reboot or reimagining would be complete without a few cameos while a couple of them seemed a tad forced again it didnt do enough to detract from the story so long as you dont let it    all in all  i personally feel this film is a welcomed addition to the ghostbusters universe  even though theres very little tiein with the original franchise is it better than the first of course not but i personally wasnt expecting to be it makes its own mark in the gbu and for that im grateful you can bet your ass ill be seeing this a few more times in theatres and will gladly buy the bluray when it comes out    if you have any doubts coming into it i really hope this film changes your mind about what you thought was the film that is raping your childhood though i have a sneaking suspicion that most people arent going to change their mind if thats the case at least enjoying for what its doing  getting people talking about ghostbusters again    also  stay after the credits
Jul 15 2016,positive,great movie ignore the hate and have fun
Jul 15 2016,negative,aweful simply offensive this cash grab garbage isnt worth seeing watch the original two and dont waste your timemoney having female ghostbusters is fine but do something original huh dont rip off the first movie with gender role reversals its pandering at its best
Jul 15 2016,positive,i was skeptical but i ended up loving it  funny witty and allaround quite well done  a good spiritual successor to the original
Jul 15 2016,positive,i like the original just as any other does and i went in with absolutely no expectations im not so much a comedy fan but i have to admit that i enjoyed it so much more than i thought i would chris hemsworth imo was surprisingly funny and even though not all of his jokes worked most of them did the movie was paced well written okay and the ladies werent nearly as annoying as i feared they would be theres cameos references and respect for the original  id take this movie over idr nysm2 or alice 2 any day and thats actually something i never expected
Jul 15 2016,positive,it was a great movie doesnt beat the original but beats ghostbusters 2 also people who gave 1 star or was not interested  dont not play attention to them go enjoy the movie
Jul 15 2016,negative,honestly the girls are doing a great job but everything around them is flat the plot is meh the villain dull and theres no energy you might enjoy this more than i did if their style of humor suits you but its not my cup of tea only a few chuckles
Jul 15 2016,positive,great for families accomplished what it set out to accomplish if you want to see this movie you should see it in theaters in 3d meant for the big screen
Jul 15 2016,negative,a human enemy really ill kill my self and be master of all ghosts stupid  anti male movie shoot me in the balls please
Jul 15 2016,negative,absolutely haram trash that attempts to stand on  what equates to ow my balls comedy remiscient of childrens movies
Jul 15 2016,negative,who ever made this should be disappointed going back to make another ghostbusters i mean who asked in the first place just terrible and those damn critics that given this movie a good rating they had to get paid to say good things because the acting was bad and nothing thrilling or anything hilarious its like the director made cringe jokes hoping they would be funny but its really not i advise you dont see it save your money
Jul 15 2016,negative,i liked the opening scene first seeing the firehall the rock concert annie potts cameo and most of mckinnon hamming it up    everything else mostly just left me bored i didnt find it that funny nor scary and the action scenes just felt flat to be clear it seemed to be trying for comedyaction instead of comedyhorror so i dont think it was trying for scary the action scenes were a mess and with the humour not working for me the rest of it just kind of dragged    i dont blame the actresses here theyre actually fine mckinnons hamming it up as mentioned but everyone else just seemed kind of there i did not like hemsworths character at all nor did i like the villain and the other 4 cameo parts were distracting at best and just plain bad in the case of the largest one    i think i could see what they were trying for most times but honestly i think it came down to the timing the example im going to use and yeah thisll seem weird is how the title first appears the opening scene wraps  which again was pretty good  the old theme music starts up the ghostly bit the drums the guitars and then the title appears shortly after im not sure why this stood out but imo it needed to come in either with the guitars or on ghostbusters as i said its a weird thing to bring up but its a nonspoiler thing most of the jokes and even the action just seemed to be that tiny bit off    i dont think its as bad as the trailer reaction would indicate but i cant call it good either in fact if you end up liking this i can sort of see why you would this just didnt work for me im sorry to say
Jul 15 2016,positive,just got back from watching the new ghostbusters movie whoever put that first trailer together owes the cast and crew as well as the rest of the world a sincere apology    to give you some context i went into the theater with the thought in my mind that i was not going to keep comparing it to the original while watching it and just try to watch it as its own movie that helped a lot because while it is no ghostbusters 84 it is certainly a watchable film    first let me say that there are actually some suspenseful tense exciting and even somewhat scary moments there is plenty of action too and wait for it comedy yes thats right there are actually a lot of jokes that work really well in this movie i was smiling a lot and laughing out loud and i wasnt the only one just about everyone in the theater only about 20 of us total was laughing at the same parts i was so i definitely wasnt hallucinating    unfortunately some of the jokes still fall flat on their face the whole get out of my friend ghost is still cringeworthy which is a downright shame because that scene was actually suspenseful and interesting in the final cut until the patty character says that    some of the other more notoriously bad oneliners from the trailers were removed entirely such as the part where melissa mccarthy leans on a hot something or other and it sizzles and her comment is ow thats hot    they also cut some of the things that made the internet explode in rage at the very concept such as the dance routine the main bad guy makes the police do there are still clips of the routine in the credits and it actually works well there funny thing is it might have worked in the film itself too because by the time you get to that point in the movie you are already having fun with the silliness and style of the thing    i will warn you the cgi effects in this movie are horrendous all of the cgi looks like it came from a ps3 or xbox 360 game    so my tips for this film 1 dont keep comparing it to the original while you are trying to watch it just let it be its own thing 2 dont fight it let yourself enjoy the fact that it is a silly fun action summer flick 3 do your best not to let the horrible cgi grate on your nerves just consider the effects retro and run with it 4 try not to take it too seriously embrace that it is a silly fun action summer flick and you should have a decent time    it isnt my favorite movie of all time or even my favorite movie this year but the last line of the main part of the movie sums up my opinion of this film pretty well not the super secret after credits teaser but the main movie the gals are sharing a moment of victory and the words that isnt terrible no that isnt terrible at all    355 from me worth a couple hours of your time anyway
Jul 15 2016,neutral,sigh heres my review of ghostbusters in case any of you care its not spoilery     missed opportunities thats how i would sum up this movie  it was moderately entertaining and had a couple of fun moments i really liked the four main characters if i wasnt already married to the most wonderful woman in the world i would creepily stalk kate mckinnon as i am now secretly in love with her she really steals the show  thor is funny as hell and i cant wait to see him in other comedies definitely worth a rental but not worth 30 it doesnt even come close to capturing the feel and spirit of the original not even remotely close they even effed up the intro  all they had to do was let the damn song play through the first chorus with the logo in the background and they didnt even get that right they cut it off early at an awkward moment and you never hear the original song the rest of the movie wtf  why are you not suing these bastards ray parker jr  anyways the plot was garbage the acting from the supporting cast including the villain was absolute and total garbage there was not one single creepy or scary moment in the whole entire movie which is what made the first two so much fun they jacked slimer up so so so badin the worst way possible the special effects were worse than the original movie which was released in 1984 it did not even come close to tugging on onesingleemotional nostalgia chord however there were some cool action moments in the final battle scene the proton packs ecto1 the trap and other weapons grew on me the cameos were well placed and the after credits scene gives me slight amount of hope they might and i emphasize might get it right in the next movie  as a movie i give it a c it might bring in new fans but it sure as hell is not going to be accepted as canon by fans who grew up supporting the franchise its a blatantly obvious quick cash grab that completely neglects and ignores the preexisting fan base which is what pisses me off the most  the sad truth is hollywood isnt going to stop rebooting franchises from the 80s and they will only get it right 10 of the time so we might as well accept that now unfortunately this one didnt make the cut and falls into the other 90 of the rebooted piles of garbage out there  literally all they had to do is tweak a couple scenes and find a way to connect it to the original universe and this would be a mega hit  missed opportunities i would love to see these characters suit up with the original boys in graybut nothis asshole director just had to do his own thing overall its a semidecent movie thats worth a rental but this is not ghostbusters
Jul 15 2016,positive,great movie  loved it
Jul 15 2016,negative,simply put its just horrible
Jul 15 2016,positive,very pleasantly enjoyable movie the lesserknown actors leslie jones and kate mckinnon especially really bring it and steal the show from the from the frontrunners melissa mccarthy and kristen wig yet all of them have very funny moments there are a lot of references and cameos from the original some adding to the movie some not but overall its the kind of ghostbusters reboot it should have been which is surprising considering the trailers that were released
Jul 15 2016,positive,loved it such a fun movie i love that its a reboot but it really did its own thing and made its own story whilst still laying homage to the originals i like all the cast and chris hemsworth was so funny i loved the battle scenes with the proton packs very cool well done paul feig and team 
Jul 15 2016,negative,ugh forced punchlines predictable plot bored actors this was painful to watch
Jul 15 2016,positive,the movie had great graphics and was pretty funny  i was surprised that the producers did not use the original ghostbusters theme song  the new version of the song was not as good as the ray parker jr version from 1983
Jul 15 2016,negative,i had low expectations going in but it it turned out to be worse than i thought it would be absolutely terrible its a disgrace for this to be even remotely related to the originals dont waste your time and money
Jul 15 2016,negative,not very funny as others have pointed out its like an adam sandler movie you may chuckle a few times but its not enough laughs over the course of 2 hours to justify a 10 movie ticket sticky floors and overpriced popcorn the problem with snl alumni is they typically only have enough material for a 5 minute sketch the rest is just filler its not the worst movie i have seen i just dont understand how so much time and money can be invested in a project and this is what we get dont they hire people during filming to say hey thats not funny or did some kid animate that ghost during study hall i look forward to summer because it is supposed to be a great time for movies one thing hollywood has learned is that people will buy tickets no matter how bad a movie is so there really is no point in creating a quality film if you can still make a profit save your money and send hollywood a message if this movie gets a sequel i will lose faith in hollywood then again they kept making those painful transformers movies so i really dont have much faith left
Jul 15 2016,positive,ok heres the review go into this film like i did its not a remakenew people  new story line special effects were great these ladies are hilarious in their own right i did feel like the directorwriters held them back a bit on their jokes let them do what they do and that is to be funny it was fun to see some new faces and some old there is a tribute to harold ramis in there wont tell you where we give it a thumbs up entertaining and worth a watch
Jul 15 2016,positive,saw the movie last night it was great fun some of the best imax 3d since avatar to be honest i originally was not going to see this movie but my daughter wanted to go see the girl ghostbusters it was very funny with lots of rememberable lines dont know why so many people are hating on this movie honestly i think a lot of those reviews that didnt enjoy it are fake check it out im sure you wont regret it be sure to stay through a little bit of the credits as well
Jul 15 2016,neutral,basics of it all it wasnt gb1984 it wasnt funny for a comedy it fell flat kate mckinnon is enjoyably weird chris hemseworth is annoying and the only cameos that are decent are ernie hudson and sigourney weavers  not a terrible film and wouldve been better if it didnt have the ghostbusters name to it something more of an snl skit that went on for way too long
Jul 15 2016,negative,when is hollywood going to realize that these women are not funny chis was the only funny one but comedy isnt his main genre i dont see how the critics gave this movie above a 70
Jul 15 2016,negative,starts strong but this should have been called man hating the movie
Jul 15 2016,negative,this was horrible omg fuck this movie and fuck sony
Jul 15 2016,positive,as someone who is a fan of paul feigmelissa mccarthy movies bridesmaids and spy as well as the original ghostbusters going to see this movie was a nobrainer and i was not disappointed some jokes fell a little flat but i was still laughing consistently throughout and my 9 and 11 year old nieces loved the movie as well
Jul 15 2016,positive,this was just fun holtzmann steals the show
Jul 15 2016,negative,a political film trying to force an agenda down our throats
Jul 15 2016,negative,i seen it for free and feel like i want my money back some ppl where funny but in all the company was bad and so was the cgi
Jul 15 2016,neutral,theres a thin line between great and awful ladies and gentleman ghostbusters 2016 is that mediocre thin line
Jul 15 2016,negative,feminist propaganda is not fun we deserve better with our entertainment
Jul 15 2016,negative,the original classic belongs in a timecapsule  this particular version belongs in the garbage  the dialogue is horrible  the jokes are painfully unfunny  the performances are all terrible  christopher hemsworth gives the worst performance of his career to date  some of the surviving stars of the original movie make cameos  that is to remind you how infinitely superior the original classic is  ignore what the poster for this movie says  do not answer the call  you will just be wasting your time and your money
Jul 15 2016,positive,great movie it was interesting and very funny this movie is a great renew and would make its original proud the only problem i have with this movie is the portrayal of paddys character as the stereotypical sassy black woman and the fact that she was the only woman who wasnt a scientist
Jul 15 2016,positive,i went in expecting the worst and walked out completely surprised the actresses made the characters their own while still staying true to each ghostbuster role if you watch and listen carefully there are a lot of homages to the original some snark at the naysayers and a novelty in their own sarcastic sometimes selfdeprecating brand of humor in fact the only character i didnt quite warm up to was one of the cameo appearances to have the gumption to take such a classic and remake it i have to give them credit  i think they did it as much justice as they could knowing full well hardcore gb fans might be offended even if it had been offthecharts hysterical there were certainly enough laugh out loud moments for me to walk out of the theater happy that they made it
Jul 15 2016,negative,honestly me and my father who are big fans of ghostbusters were really disappointed by this movie the only enjoyable thing about this experience was eating the popcorn at the theater but you will ultimately it throw up at the bad cgi go see secret life of pets if you want to watch a good movie that is enjoyable to everyone
Jul 15 2016,negative,this movie is garbagecant think of any other word for itlets take some specific points acting either crappy blunt performances from mccarthy  and wiig  as well as the miserable cameos to over the top desperate overacting from hemsworth and the neurotic  blond chick story makes no sense just a combination of coincidences trying to bring in as many elements of the old movie as possible and endless potholes not plotholes  you need to have a plot  for that i enjoyed the 3d effects though  as a kid enjoying a 3d rollercoaster  but the difference is that i dont have to pay 25  for an imax  ticket on the rollercoaster  save yourselves  stay away
Jul 15 2016,positive,i want kate mckinnons character to be my new best friend great movie  light hearted  nice to see role reversals from the stereotypes  good cameos from the old cast and that theme tune is stuck in my head
Jul 15 2016,positive,it was a great movie  i will see it again  all the crying over this movie is completely unjustified  the characters were funny and well developed the story had flow my only complaint was i didnt love the designs of the ghosts
Jul 15 2016,negative,empty characters blatant racism sophomoric writing and maybe three good jokes in the entire move   like watching an adam sandler movie youll enjoy the first 20 minutes and then watch the movie fall apart
Jul 15 2016,negative,when your entire movie premise is what if the ghostbusters were female  you cant be surprised when its performance falls flat
Jul 15 2016,negative,yes this is garbage if this is part of 3rd wave feminism to make poor remakes with thin characters and full of hate towards men then it is doomed to be a failure and as forgotten as this movie will be anyone giving this movie a 5 stars obviously is making a political statement and nothing about the movie not realizing they are being suckered by sony
Jul 15 2016,positive,great movie if you go in with an open mind youll live it
Jul 15 2016,positive,this movie was awesome
Jul 15 2016,negative,garbage through and through
Jul 15 2016,negative,did you like haunted mansion scooby doo 2 or batman and robin if yes then you might like this dumpster fire of a movie the acting was flat and phoned in the editing looks as if it was done by committee in a group home the techno babel was utter gibberish the direction of this movie was absurd acting choices are one thing this was just a failed snl skit like one of the ones that over stays its welcome really quick and it becomes cringe inducing to watch the actors flop around directionless this is a poor movie and i imagine many of the critics are afraid to call it out because of potential backlash like many youtube commentators have been when talking about the trailers
Jul 15 2016,neutral,ok for comedy but it ruins the originals
Jul 15 2016,positive,not nearly as bad as what people wanted a fun movie with some good laughs but not a flawless film set aside your hate and just enjoy the ride cause its a fun one
Jul 15 2016,negative,this is literally the worst thing to happen in human history im not merely saying this is the very worst movie ever made this is the worst thing out of everything ever in the theater i was actually thinking back on better times like my grandfathers funeral or the day prince died   if a doctor told me that i had cancer and only had 24 hours to live it would be a better experience than this movie
Jul 15 2016,negative,my god they ruined it
Jul 15 2016,negative,this movie is shit    its horribly pieced together and delivered cold  vomit forever
Jul 15 2016,positive,fantastic remake that manages to be funny in ways both reminiscent of the original and divergent from it mckinnons background offbeat performance quietly steals the show but the entire main cast turns in hilarious and heartfelt performances that had me laughing all the way right through the credits sequences the only weakness for me was that it wanted too much to nod to the original when it could easily have stood on its own feet and would have been better for it
Jul 15 2016,positive,after the batman v superman critics vs fans war has temporarily concluded ultimate edition coming july 19 where that war will reignite its safe to say that this is the reverse of that war the classless ghostbusters fans who are too nostalgic for their own good have made sure that theyll do everything in the book to make this film fail just like the critics made sure that bvs wouldnt reach a billion dollars that being said the soundtrack was phenomenal the sfx were amazing the cast especially kate mckinnon was awesome and the post credits ending made me feel like i was watching a marvel and dc collaboration amalgam comics right in front of my eyes from the shifts of tone from light to dark and the villain felt like baron zemo and lex luthor jr fused together to make an even better villain
Jul 15 2016,negative,if you watched the trailers and didnt like what you saw then avoid this movie i ignored my instincts because i hoped against hope that it wouldnt be as awful as it looked but they stripped any sense of wit and cleverness from it in favor of poorly done special effects
Jul 15 2016,positive,outstanding hilarious female characters that are refreshingly human and funny i wanted to watch it again as soon as the credits rolled on
Jul 15 2016,negative,horrible movie  not funny nor scary
Jul 15 2016,negative,what a disappointment paul feig fails to create a film worth being called watchable its a kick in the teeth for fans and a kick in the balls to men this feminist infused approach to rebooting a series constantly bashes men in a way that might leave many fans of the series feeling very uncomfortable with every awkward joke
Jul 15 2016,positive,theres a line in the classic ray parker jr theme song that states i aint afraid of no ghosts im here to say that you shouldnt be afraid of this movie this new take on ghostbusters will have you laughing from start to finish kristen wiig plays erin gilbert a nervous university professor who has put her days of tracking the paranormal behind her she was firmly under the impression that her book ghosts from the past was long forgotten until the head dance of the aldridge mansion museum comes to her office looking for help apparently erins coauthor abby yates mccarthy has placed the book back in circulation erin is forced to confront this part of his life even if it risks her chance at tenure the reunion between erin and abby isnt all roses and daisies but they team up with abbys assistant jillian holtzmann mckinnon to investigate the mansion while inside they come in contact with a fullblown class 4 apparition who spews slime all over erin    the aldridge mansion isnt the only sighting of ghosts mta worker patty tolan jones catches a creepy dude casey lurking along the subway tracks and spots him placing a device on the wall its a homemade portal hes made to unleash ghosts onto the city she calls upon abby and erin to get to the bottom of it and ultimately joins their team word spreads in the media about the viral videos theyve created with their sightings and they are branded the ghostbusters much to erins demise    the first piece of advice i would have to anyone going into this is to not to compare it to the 1984 film it works better when you just take it as its own property and not make any sort of comparisons or judgments it feels like a fresh contemporary take on the world created by dan aykroyd and harold ramis without feeling the need to recycle jokes or references it completely stands on its own without any mention of the human characters or events that occurred in the first two films slimer and the stay puft marshmallow man do pop up but are not used as the films main villains now that being said if youve recently watched the first two films or know them like the back of your hand you will notice some subtle touches along to way that are treated like homages versus a blatant rip off of a punchline or plot point    director paul feig bridesmaids spy has partnered with kate dippold on the writing duties she previously wrote the heat for which he directed and starred melissa mccarthy ive said it before and ill say it again that feig knows how to write and direct for his actors he has four of the funniest women working today with mccarthy kristen wiig leslie jones and kate mckinnon and the film really utilizes their specific brands of humor all four are saturday night live vets so there is some caricature style acting versus realism but this is a movie called ghostbusters so take that for what you will audiences are probably more familiar with mccarthy and wiig and the two of them arent doing anything different than what weve seen from them before mccarthy has her usual blunt borderline mean attitude but feig knows how to keep it reined in so it doesnt feel like its gone too far jones and mckinnon have been breakout stars of snl in the past few years and both of them should hopefully become household names after this film due to their scenestealing capabilities jones is a sassy force of nature not to be reckoned with while mckinnon can play kooky like none other mckinnons scene involving a punk rock wig still cracks me up after watching it multiple times now    another surprise in the film is hunky chris hemsworth as their nerdy secretary kevin he has great comedic chops that have been very underrated until now hes hosted snl a couple of times and im glad hes finally able to really show off that side of him outside of thor he hasnt always found the right roles for him as the leading man in the heart of the sea blackhat and the huntsman didnt showcase him in the best light ghostbusters plays on that idea of him being objectified for his body despite being a complete moron its a great play on the countless movies that find the bimbo blonde hired for her beauty instead of her brain    i wanted my review to stay clear of the idiotic backlash the film received from internet trolls they claimed their youth would be ruined with a reboot of their precious 1984 ghostbusters according to them nothing could ever top that especially with four women as the leads its such misogynistic thinking that it depressed me to think that these four women had to deal with it well low and behold the film has a running commentary on how the ghostbusters need to defy the naysayers who are out to prove they are a hoax every public incident is dealt with a pr women played by snls cecily strong who must find a way to spin their story against them there were specific lines of dialogue that made me question how much was added after the backlash occurred    speaking of the original ghostbusters films there are many cameos from previous actors rumors started swirling about how they would come into play and im not about to spoil that here all of the main players come back except for harold ramis who has since passed away and rick moranis who has retired from acting unfortunately many of them come across as gimmicky leaving an oddly sour taste as i was eagerly anticipating their arrival of those returning annie potts and ernie hudson felt the most natural    i remember when i first saw ghostbusters as a kid that it was a bit scary those growling dogs zuul and gozer still freak me out the 2016 version winds up being far less scary and plays more for the comedy thanks to its nutty characters and the chemistry of the four leads it plays into nostalgia but doesnt try to rely too heavily on whats come before like other recent reboots like star wars the force awakens or creed you have to go in the same way you would with a new james bond or a new batman its the same background but looked at with a whole new lens yes its not perfect some of the jokes dont land and its another contemporary comedy where it feels a bit more improvised to find the right punchline the films villain rowan is oddly weak and not all that memorable its the women who rock out and will no doubt make you laugh i hope it will do gangbusters at the box office and prove there is room for a potential franchise make sure to stay through the credits as there is a delightful postcredit sequence    is it worth your trip to the movies may just be one of the funniest movies of the summer    rating 4 out of 5 ticket stubs
Jul 15 2016,negative,there are two reasons this pile of garbage was made  1 because remakes make money  2 because feminists    the humour isnt funny the cast is mediocre the special effects make me miss jar jar and the plot    if i wanted to stare at shit for two straight hours id just gaze down my toilet and it would be cheaper as well
Jul 15 2016,positive,a funny entertaining remake probably not 5 stars but the rating is really low because everyones giving it one star
Jul 15 2016,positive,of course it will never be as good as the original but was it fun hell yeah kate mckinnon steals the show
Jul 15 2016,negative,i got nothing wrong with females but these guys couldnt live up to the generic male cast people should stop being so easily offended and leave the classics as they were made to be
Jul 15 2016,positive,thank you i am from the generation that idolises the original film its a respectful nod to the trilogy intelligently made and brings back all the same emotions with its wonderful quirky blend of humour and weird science it was spectacularly colourful literally laugh a minute brilliantly scripted and case  a fantastic film cant wait for the inevitable sequel
Jul 15 2016,negative,sexism works both ways and this reboot stinks of it
Jul 15 2016,negative,really awful movie save your money and watch it on netflix or redbox
Jul 15 2016,positive,anyone who gives this 1 or 2 stars hasnt actually seen it several comments giving it 1 star even say they havent seen it as a huge fan of the original i was understandably concerned but open minded i absolutely loved it hilarious puts you in a good mood and has definite rewatch value going to see it again this weekend the audience figures here are skewed by men who cant handle an all female cast and supposed fans of the original who havent seen it i mean dan akroyd is an executive producer and every living member of the original bar moranis makes an appearance go watch it and make up your own mind but i want a sequel as soon as they can make it
Jul 15 2016,negative,i was forced to go and watch it by my gf it was somewhat better than i was expecting it to be effects was good and overall movie original theme  however movie was not as funny for me as for my gf mostly because of the farting vg and gooe in every crack jokes  i felt like i was watching sex in the city with some good cgi  i have no problem with femail cast but if you making remake on beloved movie by fanboys like myself you need to do much better job  please dont make 2nd movie aka 4
Jul 15 2016,negative,that fresh rating is a complete lie this movie pales in comparison to the first two i was utterly bored watching it and i didnt laugh at all barely chuckled and i thought this was supposed to be a comedy right dont waste your money on this garbage it is low brow comedy it patronizes women and certainly insults all men everywhere it is by far the worse reboot yet especially of a beloved franchise like this dont take your kids and certainly dont waste your money i saw it in imax3d thankfully as a treat from someone but sadly i wish they could get back their money
Jul 15 2016,negative,dumb idea to change conception of old ghostbusters
Jul 15 2016,negative,how can there be such a huge disparity between critics opinion and the general audience the movie probably sucks if regular people think it is awful to watch
Jul 15 2016,negative,destroyed a memory of a great movie the fact that batman v superman got ripped apart by critics and this gets praised just shows why blockbuster films are lacking great stories
Jul 15 2016,negative,i wish i could report that the new ghostbusters  a reimagining of the beloved 1984 original this time with an allfemale lead cast  was as much of a comic masterpiece as its predecessor thereby thumbing its cinematic nose at the haters who cried foul at the announcement of its gynocentric production why in the second decade of the 21st century anyone would object to a new version of the story with women in the main parts i do not know may such losers encounter the eternal bad karma that they deserve sadly however my reasons for not appreciating the film are far more pedestrian its script is a complete mess and not that funny cowritten by katie dippold the heat and director paul feig spy the screenplay lurches from one underrealized and overproduced situation to another forgetting such essentials as meaningful character development and the joyful interplay of joke setup vs payoff sure there are a few genuine laughs but given who is on screen that was inevitable for the most part its just a specialeffectsdriven bore    kristen wiig the skeleton twins and melissa mccarthy st vincent play childhood friends erin and abby  scientists or so were told  who once coauthored a book on ghosts before growing apart now erin is on the tenure track at columbia while abby labors in an unauthorized lab with jillian  kate mckinnon the angry birds movie one of the two best things in the movie  perfecting their specialized phantom detectors when a local haunting in an unlikely mansion in the middle of manhattan brings erin and abby reluctantly back together all three quickly discover that the spirit world is indeed real and in fact quite active soon they are joined by patty  leslie jones top five the other reason to see the film  an employee of the mta who contacts the nascent ghostbusters when the subway station she supervises receives an unwelcome spectral visitor ask yourself why as in the original the lone africanamerican is a workingclass stiff rather than a scientist like the others for reasons poorly explained in the script patty decides to join the other three and soon they are all running around new york city brandishing nuclearpowered weapons they barely understand capturing ghosts    all of which is fine i guess except that every scene feels as if it were directed by a firsttimer and sketched by a writer determined to make as much room for improv as possible but for my money the best improvisational riffs usually emerge out of a decent initial structure and what passes for plot devices here feel so farfetched that the jokes mostly fall flat chris hemsworth rush as a dimwitted but very hunky secretary is a prime example hes kind of amusing but without the support of a wellcrafted gag what comic timing he can muster feels mostly forced the cameos from the stars of the original movie are also hit or miss the best ones come later in the film so stick around if youre tempted to leave unfortunately on top of all of the other misfires the main villain of the movie is a caricature of a grownup bullying victim pasty and overweight exacting his revenge on the world for its past sins against him really they couldnt do better than make fun of the socially awkward    its too bad as there was a lot of potential with this cast and the original premise inept ghost hunters who somehow stumble into saving the world worked the first time around and there was no reason to think it wouldnt here personally i would have preferred to see the story set in the same universe as the 1984 movie rather than in a world where those events never happened but certainly the choice to start fresh is not the reason this movie fails perhaps as with many contemporary comedies witness the recent sisters or quite a few will ferrell films no one bothered with the story imagining that the assembly of the cast was enough certainly if you are a diehard fan of any of these actresses you may enjoy the film for hertheir own sake and more power to you i however was hoping for more than the occasional chuckle
Jul 15 2016,positive,entertaining funny and fun
Jul 15 2016,positive,very scary at times very funny at times great references and cameos and kate mckinnon stole the show with one of if not the best character in the whole franchise the credits take forever but they are worth sitting through great marvel style end of the movie sequel tease not as good as the original but possibly funnier
Jul 15 2016,positive,absolutely loved it  so funny and entertaining with the perfect amount of nostalgia and the slight spooky factor
Jul 15 2016,negative,id give the film 3 stars for mediocrity but sonys handling of ivan reitman the original cast and the fans easily earned my rating    next time please respect the people paying to see your movie
Jul 15 2016,positive,a freaky new generation blast nearly equal to the original i was pleasantly surprised with the script and performances and the casting was great the naysayers prior to release had it all wrong and need to lighten up and get a life the cameos were all a breath of fresh air with a surprise at the end all the cast were great but kate mckinnon stole the show with leslie jones not far behind the cgi in 3d were spectacular and ere the extra ticket price this movie was a fun summer romp that had us thrilled and laughing go go go
Jul 15 2016,negative,very very megh  with moments of true cringe and boredom i tried but its no ghostbusters
Jul 15 2016,negative,the film struggles to maintain any true laughs and you cant help but wince at their attempts at comedy chris hemsworths performance is the only thing lifting this film from being totally awful ghostbusters shouldnt have been rebooted and this is the reason why stop rebooting beloved franchises hollywood back to the future will end up getting a reboot a week after robert zemeckis dies with this track record
Jul 15 2016,positive,loved it i thoroughly enjoyed each of the characters and was excited to see them find their own personalities rather than try to imitate the original cast great references to the original movie again without trying to be the original movie lots of laughs and a wonderful chemistry between the main characters the special effects were amazing and i loved the cameos from the original ghostbusters a few times i laughed then cringed at the portrayal of kevin is really ok to portray him as a sexy but dumb stereotype because hes a guy nope despite that a thumbs up from me all round
Jul 15 2016,positive,ghostbusters is definitely one of the better films of the summergreat performances from the lead actresses with hilarious oneliners and pays homage to the original with its cameos and easter eggs the 3rd act is highly entertaining with outstanding vfx and brought something new to this reboot franchise although the movie suffers from same old plot as the original and some jokes didnt land well   810
Jul 15 2016,negative,its so not funny just a bad movie people would be better off watching paint dry then this to many cameos they are just living off the back off the original enough said
Jul 15 2016,positive,very funny and action pact movie enjoyed all the reference and cameos from the original will see it again
Jul 15 2016,negative,looks terrible will not bother watching
Jul 15 2016,positive,a movie for the fans and a stand alone for the new generation the bust of egon spengler and the dedication to harold ramis brought a tear to my eye the only issue was chris hemsworth dumber than dumb character but the ladies smashed it
Jul 15 2016,negative,wow 2hours of male bashing  so great if ur ansjw
Jul 15 2016,positive,i went into this film today with a couple o friends its out already in oz it was a really funny movie great action scenes and can stand proud next to the original kate mckinnons holtzmann stole the show
Jul 15 2016,positive, the ghostbusters the team itself the chemistry the gadgets the ecto1 the newish logo their origin story literally everything about the team itself save for a few moments where kate mckinnon became female johnny depp and hey if thats your thing have i got a movie to sell you every second they spent on scree worked   the cameos i have heard some complains about the movie stopping dead in its track to do cameos but outside of ozzy every cameo was organic as fuck imo   the source material the movie handles the source material with all of the charm and respect that the sequel does not possess i have no doubt in my mind that paul feig and the girls love ghostbusters   chris hemsworth he steals literally every scene that he is in there isnt a single line of dialogue of his that isnt absolute gold   the subtle digs at the mra community im sorry if you spent 2 years crying about this movie happening you deserve to be made fun of this movie never gets mean about the people it sets out to piss off but it does address the elephant in the room with all of the tactfulness youd expect from paul feig   slimmer and while were at it the cgi thats just what happens when theres been 30 years in between good ghostbusters movies i know but still the cgi in this movie was phenomenal and slimmer is a total dick its basically a recurring cameo but him and his girl are perfect  what doesnt work  the trailers
Jul 15 2016,negative,it just fails to be funny
Jul 15 2016,negative,horrible toss in your seat terrible
Jul 15 2016,negative,the movie came off childish and never really took off for me  bad jokes and bad bad cgi  kids will probably think it is  awesome  i dont recommend seeing it 
Jul 15 2016,positive,wonderful job at making a classic an original  this was truly a treat
Jul 15 2016,positive,really enjoyed it it was a good time at the movies the main cast do what they do best but was specially entertained by mckinnon and hemsworth i can see the former becoming a movie star in her own right this film is one of the best 3d movies this year in this case the 3d is not just a gimmick to get your extra few dollars also probably the best rolling credits ive seen in a while it kept the audience till they ended
Jul 15 2016,positive,well that wasnt terrible cant say it was any where near as good as the original  but it wasnt who ever put those god awful trailers together  failed to computer any of what makes this film good  firsts of all whats bad  some of the characters are quite flat unfortunately this is your two leads which sucks as wigg and mccarthy  are bloody good in most of there other films  its definitely script over ability here most of the characters lack something and dont get me started on the whole whole subplot about the mayor which is very cartooniebut as i said this isnt a bad film though it seems to find if the original used a joke once lets use it again and again here  whats good lets start with the best thing in this movie kate mckinnon  holtzmann is the best thing in the whole damn movie shes up there with the original ghostbusters for me shes just the right side of deranged and i loved it  patty was also a nice addition i honestly thought from the trailer i would hate her as it showed her as very much an annoying stereotypical angry black woman luckly she wasnt and she had some good scenes playing the every woman of the group then there was  thokevin who is so dumb you just cant help but laugh  oh yeah and the ghosts look amazing if you go see it see it in 3d here are some scenes which need to be seen in 3d
Jul 15 2016,positive,sooooo funny cant wait to see it again a fish tank is like a submarine for fish 
Jul 15 2016,neutral,1st hour of the movie rating 110  last 40 min rating 910  jokes were forced and not funny  mckinnon and jones carried this movie especially on the joke side which is hilarious when you pay top dollar for popular comedians such as wiig and mccarthy  the 1st hour is slow and the jokes dont flow  after the the power of patty compels you part the action effects and jokes pick up speed  the characters are all the same  i try to not compare the old with the new because that would be unfair  however the characters from the original each had their own thing but all of these characters are to similar and so it lacks in character development
Jul 15 2016,negative,one of the worst movies ive seen recently just awful
Jul 15 2016,negative,after all the drama this is the film we get  a decent comedy with no patience who has decided that snarky quips running gags and cartoony impressions are more important that letting scenes or its characters for that matter breath  its plot is seemingly moved along as if its got an itinerary and even if its not ready yet then too dang bad    its not the worst thing ive seen this year though  the film is thoroughly carried by leslie jones and kristen wiigs characters for the 1st and 2nd acts and chris helmsworth steals the show in the third act  unfortunately the other 2 leads barely act like real humans for the remainder of the script  either side of the inane misogyny debate expect to be let down  maybe thats for the best
Jul 15 2016,negative,i desperately wanted to like this movie but it was just plain no fun and it seemed to drag on
Jul 15 2016,positive,bruh all the haters just pissed because its better than they wanted it to be its not even fair how many fake bad reviews were already written before the movie came out dont try to make a movie look trash before it comes out i saw it today and loved it
Jul 15 2016,negative,it was horrible offensive and could have been write by a chimp
Jul 15 2016,negative,shameless as shameless gets unfunny cringeworthy and contender for worst movie of the year
Jul 15 2016,negative,by far the worst movie of the summer
Jul 15 2016,positive,honestly see it for yourself get your own opinion on it its all about the story the drama with the making fun and cast doesnt matter in the end its a great film that pays tribute to the classic films and opens the door for future installments    go see it laugh have a good time thats what movies are for
Jul 15 2016,negative,dont listen to the paid reviewers this movie flat out sucked it took a shit on the franchise
Jul 15 2016,negative,hypocritical in its message against gender misogyny forced awkward humor from a cast of unlikeable characters with no chemistry whatsoever and has the gonads to blame the fans for its filth ghostbusters in 2016 is what fantastic four was in 2015 a horrible boring and quite unnecessary remake
Jul 15 2016,positive,not bad there were a few awkward stilted moments but otherwise solid i added 12 a star to offset the insecurity hatred
Jul 15 2016,negative,i went into this movie with high hopes because im a huge kristen wiig fan but i was deeply dissapointed the films characters all had terrible chemistry together wiig was the only one to bring actual laughs throughout the film leslie jones is another favourite of mine but sadly this has been her worst role yet the stereotypical character was predictable and flat kate mckinnon usually in my opinon over reacts every character shes gets ahold of and this is no exemption melissa mcarthy has failed once again to live up to her great comedic moments that were once present in bridesmaids now this could be her worst role yet and yes worst than tammy the movie was simply not that funny and failed to bring a laugh almost every joke the plot is as terrible as you would expect as it is boring obvious and sometimes embarrassing to watch this i really did hope for this movie to bring a much needed revamp of reboots with its awesome cast but sadly it has fallen to yet another bad remake from a studio out to make money off a vast fan base
Jul 15 2016,positive,if you forget that there were two original movie before this then and only then you can appreciate this film
Jul 15 2016,neutral,i have loved ghostbusters growing up it has been a big part of my life ever since i saw the first movie when i was 5 years old i was excited by the idea of a new movie this movie is not what i was expecting however    there were some good parts some funny parts and some good acting i loved kate mckinnons character honestly i found all four of the main cast believable in their roles for the most part the part i had a hard time with was the campiness of everything some of the characters were just absurdly caricaturized there were also a lot of unnecessary nods to the original movie which i felt were very forced while i found myself entertained for most by the end i felt disappointed i wanted to like it i really wanted to like it i wanted it to be at least on par with ghostbusters ii but i left the theater feeling more like i did after watching indiana jones and the crystal skull
Jul 15 2016,neutral,the movies okay not as bad as the negative criticism it making it out to be  i had a lot of fun and chuckled a bit thought it would be funnier cameos were a bit of a distraction but it was a good time at the movies
Jul 15 2016,positive,went into it expecting a fun summer movie and thats exactly what i got i genuinely really enjoyed it and will probably see it again
Jul 15 2016,negative,how dare you fucking remake a classic
Jul 15 2016,negative,average at best and thats if you a generous
Jul 15 2016,positive,it was honestly pretty badass and i was feeling very nostalgic throughout the film
Jul 14 2016,positive,loved it  left me wanting more 
Jul 14 2016,negative,it tried and had some ok parts but ultimately the story wasnt there props for kate mckinnon though
Jul 14 2016,positive,they had a story to tell and big shoes to fill this is straight dope gb movie it is not an added sequel it is a reboot and one that is amazingly cool    anyone that knocks this movie is not right in the head
Jul 14 2016,positive,while the villain was dumb the movie holds up
Jul 14 2016,negative,i really had high hopes for this movie i really did paul feig has had excellent experience alongside kristen wiig and melissa mccarthy in bridesmaids and spy kate mckinnon is an snl alum and we even have chris hemsworth here lovely  unfortunately while this movie does try to stand on its own merits and i will anything for trying it must be compared to the 1984 original given that it shares several cast members in cameo form that harold ramis worked on the project before his tragic passing and the very name of course  so first and foremost characters all protagonists have one character trait and they are in order of appearance nerdy melissa mccarthy crazy black and stupid although stupid does get sexy as a bonus thats it thats all we get we dont get to know any of them i dont know half the characters names i only know hemsworths name was kevin because they kept shouting it at him wiig and mccarthys characters remain anonymous i do remember holtzman if only because she was the most irritating part of the entire movie i do not understand why people are telling me she had standout moments of comedy or that she is a young bill murray surely she has to tell some jokes for that to happen  the editing made all of us nauseous the movie well never pan away or zoom or do anything interesting with the camera it has two tricks smash cut and shot reverse shot often when it has nothing to cut to best example was on mccarthys character in the exorcist scene it will cut to the same thing but slightly closer  the editing is too fast to build any kind of tension or to let any kind of joke land many of the things that people say are funny but its too late for them the editor refuses to take a moment to let the audience laugh or let a joke sink in before were off to the races again  the script was very weak everything important is set up as late as possible with the idea of chekovs gun thrown out the window down the stairs and all records of its existence burned the movie spends most of its annoyingly long runtime trying to figure out who its main villain should be should it be the government that wants to hush up any idea ofnope that problem can be ignored i suppose should it be the guy that wants to prove that theyre fraudsi guess not because that problem is solved in a very quick and very gruesome manner so whos the villain then the nutball thats been muttering to himself and only gets three minutes of screentime it cant be that guy i dont even know his name i only know his motivation because he told me that he was bullied as a kid the second time he was in a scene  to paraphrase the immortal words of the robot devil your script lacks subtlety you cant have your characters just say who they are and yet with all the exposition i still havent learned anything about the characters why does the black chick until you give her a couple of interesting character traits and a couple of dignified things to say that is what i will call her know everything there is to know about new york architectural history nerdy and mccarthy grew up together great expand on that make holtzman shut up shes pissing me off  the thing that disappoints me most is that i know these women are funny i have seen it with my own eyes you have proved to the world that women are funny you dont have to prove it again youre all competent comedians youre all saying funny things the camera work is uninspired and so is the blocking but feig never really was known for either of those things now was he he was known for putting a bunch of funny people in a room and seeing what happened so weve narrowed down the actual problem to the editors and the screenwriters both of these are foundational parts of a good film and we see how imperative it is that they go right otherwise a movie with a lot of potential ends up looking like another cash grab trying to whack at the heels of its infinitely more successful and talented older sibling
Jul 14 2016,negative,the only good part of this movie is the opening 2 minutes  as it progressed each minute was worse than the last  really sad disjointed stupid effort here  this director should be blacklisted  seriously
Jul 14 2016,positive,amazingly i was thoroughly entertained the girls are so funny and the 3d effects were awesome a very good remake
Jul 14 2016,positive,one of the funniest movies ive seen in a long time i was crying from laughing more than once each of the main actresses does an amazing job i think this movie did a wonderful job at rebooting the franchise and making their own new movie while paying homage to the original
Jul 14 2016,positive,judging this by only what it lacks voice of the original actors etc from the original is misguided on its own merits this is a perfectly entertaining movie its funny the ghosts are scary and the new busters have personality for days i aint fraid of no sequel
Jul 14 2016,positive,this movie has gotten a ton of hate since the remake was first announced im not big on remakes in general but i feel it paid homage to the original the beginning was a little slow and the jokes werent that funny but it got better yes this movie like all movies has its flaws but it isnt garbage and deserves a chance
Jul 14 2016,negative,terrible cgi terrible actors terrible plot and unoriginal to boot the first joke is a queef joke and that pretty much sets the bar for the rest of the film when cameos are the best part and they are still bad of the movie you know its shit
Jul 14 2016,positive,moderately scary for a bit of a fraidycat like me very funny great ensemble and cameos that are thankfully not heavy handed
Jul 14 2016,positive,just as funny as the first perfect casting great comedy and the cameos were not that corny a good nod to the past but it has its own future
Jul 14 2016,positive,fun i laughed quite a bit and my 4 year old daughter left wanting to be a ghostbuster scientist winwin
Jul 14 2016,negative,im trying to think of something nice to say about this movie all i can come up with is that it had a decent running time just under two hours the story was blah the antagonist was terrible and for a movie that asked not to be judged for having an all female cast they really objectified chris hemsworth to no end the easter eggs throughout the movie are hit or miss if you can sit through the credits theres one big name drop at the very end even with low expectations i was still disappointed
Jul 14 2016,positive,as a light hearted family comedy it hits the mark it isnt a new concept so it is hard not to compare it to the original it follows the trend of falling on special effects and thin on story that isnt the fault of the film as much as the fault of the industry it had a good backbone for a storyline and the characters were there
Jul 14 2016,positive,i really liked this reboot the trailers gave almost nothing away its family fun nothing super serious just a great fun movie that can reintroduce a great franchise to new generations
Jul 14 2016,positive,went in to this movie with low expectations but it was pretty good and funny
Jul 14 2016,positive,this does not deserve the negative backlash that its received so far online i really enjoyed it will definitely see this again
Jul 14 2016,negative,ooof it was pretty bad to the point where i have to wonder if sony bought some positive reviews    after dismissing the movie based on the horrible trailer i actually allowed myself to hold out some hope after seeing a 75 score but    it was bad  the jokes werent funny the action wasnt exciting there was no tension and even less chemistry  it was just lame joke after lame joke without any of the tension or threat that made the original such a tight narrative    also patty is an awful stereotype and shame on leslie for agreeing to play such a dumb and loud character    awful awful movie
Jul 14 2016,negative,i wish i can rate this movie negative stars its like they werent even trying to make a good movie easily my most hated movie of the year
Jul 14 2016,neutral,surprisingly original but all the jokes fall flat and the characters and many of the performances feel weird and out of place the director is a major problemhes  good at what he does but ghostbusters isnt that
Jul 14 2016,positive,its good nowhere close to the original but it has its real moments of humor and for me its adequate enough
Jul 14 2016,positive,id like to think theres not as much ignorance in the world as the internet tells me there is but the small corner of the world wide web known as imdb and more specifically the user reviews for 2016s reboot of ghostbusters would suggest everything ive hoped to be true about this world is in fact wrong given the film has been out in wide release for less than 24 hours at the time of this writing its astonishing how many harsh and outlandish tirades have been hurled at this film of course were not here to discuss the inability of what are likely now forty yearold men to share in the wealth of their childhoods childhoods that provided such pleasures at the original 1984 film and extend those same feelings of excitement and pure joy to the kids of today and moreover the young girls and women of today who have undoubtedly always looked to the portrayal of their gender in hollywood and wondered why they were always so restrained as far as im concerned and as far as i can tell i was born in 1987 so i dont exactly get the hoopla that surrounds the original despite how much the original ghostbusters was a huge success and universally praised at the time of its release ive never understood the level of infatuation with it sure its a perfectly enjoyable comedy with a charismatic cast and unique premise but in the thirty plus years since its release i cant help but think the film has lost some of its charm otherwise i wouldnt feel as out of the loop with this new allfemale version director paul feig has both paid homage to the original film while creating a world and characters all his own written by feig with the help of the heat screenwriter kate dippold this new ghostbusters universe doesnt capitalize wholly on the gimmick of the gender swap but more it uses this basis of an idea to explore a familiar world from a new perspective while no matter how good the film might have turned out to be there would undoubtedly still be people decrying the fact it exists at all but that it is a lot of fun if not necessarily an exceptional comedy will surely only anger them more to remain focused on those who take away from the unadulterated fun that ghostbusters can provide though is to be reminded of the disappointment this world can be whereas to simply take the new ghostbusters on its own terms can make you believe good does in fact exist among us in short its a delight    read the whole review at 
Jul 14 2016,positive,definitely the original ghostbusters concept but taken a whole different route absolutely loved it the ladies were hysterical and a few surprise cameos that really pull it all in
Jul 14 2016,positive,fun movie good story awesome cameos  i think it was a nice homage to the original
Jul 14 2016,positive,this is me eating crow    im a 41 year old man i was not even 10 when ghostbusters came out in 1984 it was the first movie i saw im the theaters its the first soundtrack i ever bought needless to say the movie was a huge part of my childhood    i hated bridesmaids i dont care for melissa mccarthy or kristin wiigs brand of humor i wasnt opposed to an all female cast for a reboot just really had zero interest in seeing this movie and expected it to be terrible    just got in from a late show in ny and i really truly enjoyed it it paid so much respect to the original movie the cameos were brilliant chris hemsworth stole the show but all 4 of the women were funny didnt try to oversell it with their typical gags and i found myself laughing a lot more than i expected it to    the theater for a thursday 1030 show was empty it was imax 3d and if there was more than 10 people there id be shocked i dont know if its because it was late because people didnt realize it had a late showing but i genuinely hope this movie does well in the box office and fans of the original go see it with an open mind    will it ever be as good as the original for me no solely because that seemed to have more of a heart but this one had a great pulse and the visuals were amazing i can definitely say it was better than ghostbusters 2 at least lol
Jul 14 2016,negative,do i need to explain
Jul 14 2016,positive,solid 87100  good acting great effects a real sweet crush on the original movie sometimes it got bogged down in awareness of its legacy but on the whole very good supporting cast got shorted on realistic dialogue but the four mains plus hemsworth were delightful leslie jones breakout star     best effects movie of the summer
Jul 14 2016,negative,a bad remake aimed at nostalgia  some decent moments and the cameos were nice to see except seeing them made me realize just how much i wanted to see more of them and not the movie i was watching the effects looked like something out of a scooby do movie   the soundtrack score was great and some of the songs were cool as well  does not compare to the original at all and not nearly as funny  no one will talk about this film in 30 years
Jul 14 2016,positive,i put a review a few days after i watch this in theater i liked it but after watching it at home i can say it sucks there so much wrong with this movie i had to take my review back
Jul 14 2016,negative,horrible  i was embarrassed to even be in a public theater watching it  i recommend streaming it online for free if your curios and save yourself the price of admission i wanted to weep towards the end of the movie for what they did to poor slimmer and the state puff marshmallow man 
Jul 14 2016,negative,worst movie this year
Jul 14 2016,positive,it was hilarious my friends and i all laughed our asses off dont believe the sexist turds hating on this movie who havent even seen it i wasnt sure about the trailers but the movie is 10000 times better than the trailers if you love the original go see it if youve never seen it go see it you wont be disappointed
Jul 14 2016,positive,only the most die hard fans of the original ghostbusters movie will find anything to whine about in this reboot of the franchise there are few dry scenes but an overwhelming majority of this movie is a great balance between action and funny i came into this movie with low expectations as reboots of late have been missmissmisshit at best the comedic aspect of it is far more family friendly than i anticipated with little to no sexual innuendo and drug references it almost is a borderline pg rated movie aside from the casual hell or damn the reason for its pg13 rating has more to do with the realistic ghosts that roam the streets of new york this movie may scare young children but 3rd graders and above should be ok it is not the original but it is the next best thing enjoy this family friendly movie by the way the receptionist and the aquarium scene is arguably the funniest in the movie
Jul 14 2016,positive,the new ghostbusters is a great ride one that benefits immensely from the chemistry of its excellent cast theres definitely competition for mvp id say kate mckinnon whose livewire holtzmann is now my favourite ghostbuster period the film finds a good balance between funny and spooky throughout is duration and while paul feigs direction still hasnt quite found a sense of cinematic flair he still knows how to mine some great laughs and he actually handles the big effectsheavy climax fairly well the cameos and references to the original 84 film are fun for fans if not all that necessary but its when the film embraces being itself and introduces new things characters gadgets ghosts that its at its strongest
Jul 14 2016,positive,some great laughter fun to watch again
Jul 14 2016,positive,they nailed it the right amount of new while giving the perfect amount of a wink and a nudge to the original with all the original cast showing up the thing that feels weird is having modern technology in the movie it just feels off and its because the last movie was in the 80s referencing the internet blogs youtube in ghostbusters is just weird because of how old the series is but also trying to fit the ladies into the mold of the original 4 causesits difficult to classify  you expect they are going to behave a certain way and dont  it results in making the movie feel off  and its not because they are women  or the movie is bad  even if they were men the result would be the same  weve lived with the same 4 characters for pretty much a generation  if new characters had come in in the 90s it wouldnt have been a problem  but after so long of a period ray peter egon and winston are the ghostbusters  its what you come to expect  i also suspect after a few viewings these new busters will be just fine  its like a new couchthere is a break in period
Jul 14 2016,negative,ghostbusters 2 was far better  and it basically was the same plot as the first one after five years  way to ruin a good thing
Jul 14 2016,positive,under rated and unappreciated  sad that people go into this with a bias
Jul 14 2016,negative,a 2 hour longbad joke
Jul 14 2016,positive,super funny and love seeing some of the original cast
Jul 14 2016,negative,its not as bad as the trailers made it out to look but its just not very good
Jul 14 2016,positive,if youre a ghostbusters fan get some more fun and see it if youre not a ghostbusters fan stop griping about it if youre a female go see it to send a message to hollywood
Jul 14 2016,positive,not perfect but definitely doesnt deserve the hate it was getting prerelease overall pretty well made
Jul 14 2016,positive,very well done paid great homage to the originals
Jul 14 2016,positive,movie was ok made me laugh and i liked the cameos if you compare it to the originals you probably wont like it cause this one is super goofy in all i have it 3 stars its wasnt terrible but wasnt one i would watch again at the movies
Jul 14 2016,positive,pretty good movie really liked it
Jul 14 2016,positive,i wasnt expecting much but i was pleasantly surprised  its definitely different than the original in a good way much better than 2 chris hemsworth is hilarious i never thought that he was such a talented actor with such a comedic chops my favorite gb was holtzman smart and funny patty was a great edition addition as the 4th gb seeing it in 3d was great and not just a gimmick they kept it in letterbox so scenes jumped out better
Jul 14 2016,negative,amazing how a bunch of girl scientists have the same sense of humour as a bad stoner movie full of lowbrow fart jokes a nonstop arsenal of proton weapons that kill ghosts a serious oxymoron took away from the scientificmysticism that the original movies built themselves upon the reverseinsert science jargon switch that fixed the ghost problem was just simply bad writing
Jul 14 2016,negative,boring poorly written poor acting can i get the hour and 57 minutes of my life back please level of crap   there was a very good reason why bill murray told dan aykroyd no for 6 years when asked if this steaming pile of crap could be made  let me give it to you this way batman vs superman was better written and well everyone knows how even ben affleck felt about it if you dont just google for the interview that hed rather kill himself than be at   save your money hell even if they paid you to see it your time is worth more than that  i went because it was free for me and that is the only reason the cameos were the only enjoyable part of this show a whopping 3 12 minutes totally not worth it
Jul 14 2016,negative,poor remake not very funny good actors but really poor scripting there is a real  lack of interest in the characterswho didnt seem to mesh very well there was little chemistry between the main actors  with maybe two laugh out moments  really felt let down i really wanted this to be a good movie but its poor not very funny and with average special effects  there will be those who will claim thats because the main actors are women that people dont like this movie buts its really just a poor movie
Jul 14 2016,negative,save your money  i went in with no expectations to judge a film on its merits but this film fails in every way  the original ghostbusters is a classic and amazing film  great films came out of the 80s and for some reason studios think its a good idea to reboot and recash in on them  this was a bad idea from the start  the cast of the original was perfect murray aykroyd and the rest were the right people with the right chemistry and the right story this was total bs  its a reboot only about money  this is a poor story with poor acting that doesnt come close to the original which was filled with geniuses  stay clear this was as good as star wars episode i
Jul 14 2016,negative,dont really need to say anything 75 for this shit of a movie is just pure hollywood damage control
Jul 14 2016,positive,there were some great laughs the entire family enjoyed the movie
Jul 14 2016,positive,just saw this epic epic epic stand alone reboot so many easter eggs laughed from begging to end
Jul 14 2016,positive,ghostbusters is hands down the funniest film ive seen this year blast from start to finish highly recommended bring on a sequel because i need more of these characters a
Jul 14 2016,negative,had a few funny bits but it felt like most of it was the writers trying too hard to be funny or sell a scene
Jul 14 2016,negative,trailer is better than the movie  much better
Jul 14 2016,positive,thoroughly enjoyed the movie
Jul 14 2016,positive,lots of fun paid homage to original but stands on its own
Jul 14 2016,positive,its rare to find a remake thats this good so many laugh out loud moments and kickass fight scenes kate mckinnon steals the show
Jul 14 2016,positive,being of the fandom that grew up with this its easy to jump on youre computer and type hate hate hate to be honest its not a bad film the acting is on point and the story is solid i did enjoy the jokes and was laughing for a good part of the film for me this lost points in the third act  for me the ending needed some work there is tons of fan service    and i did have a good time the effects are awesome but for me i shall stick to the first two movies 3 stars
Jul 14 2016,negative,this was bridesmaids part 2 i actually like the movie bridesmaids but not as the new ghostbusters i didnt even mind the thought of women taking over the characters my simple review poor script like it was hurried too many times it was slowed down with forced jokes horrible ending i mean horrible ending and to top it off they changed the theme song to a new version smhsmhsmh i wont ruin the movie for you by telling you what happens but i will ask you to please not go to theaters and let this awful movie   make any money
Jul 14 2016,positive,so so so so so so funny can tell its gonna be a movie ill see over and over again
Jul 14 2016,negative,the critics got this wrong or intentionally chose to inflate the score of this film because of their politics many of them for months have attacked the so called sexist haters of this movie this has got to be the worst reboot ive seen since godzilla if this doesnt ruin paul feigs career especially with his behavior towards the people who didnt like this movie then theres something wrong with hollywood dialogue is cringe worthy and nothing is quotable like the original for a movie that was made in 2016 the cgi is garbage they capture 1 ghost in the entire movie and then crap all over the lore in the final battle as they straight up start killing the ghosts the 4 have no chemistry and instead of being fleshed out are just basic caricatures shy nerdy girl fat obnoxious girl physical comedy she fall down weirdo girl and loud black woman every man is either an ahole or an idiot which of course because this is a feminist film we need to show off the misandry and dont tell me its not there feig released a article exclaiming men werent funny just the other day from the time i post this the climax involves them shoot the crotch of the totally original and not all stay puft marshmallow man im sorry the ghostbusters symbol this movie is the fever dream of a white knight feminist ally who has to show the women how he totally isnt like those other guys ironic part is that the best character in this movie is chris hemsworths character a man is the best character in your feminist film where you intentionally tried to make them men crappy paul feig you need to quit your day job
Jul 14 2016,positive,this movie was good it didnt try to replicate the original two ghostbusters it was its own entity sometimes dry humor was top notch cameos by the original busters and gang was fun too the only ones missing were sigourney weaver i guess she was in credits didnt see her rick moranis egon rip zule and gozer  ugh the reviews as a whole for this movie are so hateful um hello superfans have you ever seen the og ghostbusters its cheesy that was a lot of the charm slimer was not played by philip seymour hoffman dont expect the acting to be so refined women can be ghostbusters and scientists check the male egos at the vortex
Jul 14 2016,positive,enjoyed the new ghostbusters  great comic actors
Jul 14 2016,negative,dead serious the worst film ive seen all year
Jul 14 2016,neutral,saying the movie was terrible is definitely not giving it the credit it deserves however for such a prestigious cast director and cinematographer it was one huge disaster maybe they shouldve hired a writer with all the money they dished out for disappointing alist actors     the leads are absolutely two dimensional and i dare say the protagonists are barely even one dimensional especially in the case of mccarthy it just seems as if they are playing the same roles youd see in every other movie theyre in sometimes it works but here it doesnt the movie lacks the phenomenal dry comedy of its predecessor and goes for a more raunchy and straitforward humor that has unfortunately graced the film industry as of late also technojargon is definitely not as funny as the writers seem the think it is was the movie too short without it    the movie did definitely make me laugh but only at the hands of jones and hemsworth the rest of the normally funny actressesactors really fell flat and i was extremely disappointed in the awful cameos by akroyd and murray     did it keep me in the seat for the whole movie yes could i sit through it without the occasional cringe no is it really that bad not at all id say it deserves a watch
Jul 14 2016,negative,just saw it  worse than the boss  dull none of the jokes were funny  we left towards early end    boring the originals are better  save your money not worth spending on a movie that bought of critics or threatened to sue them if they didnt give a high rating
Jul 14 2016,neutral,special effects were cool but it lacked a real plot
Jul 14 2016,positive,freaking amazing movie is true to the ghostbusters roots with comedy that is of current trends and reflects the humor of its predecessors ghostbusters is a film for old fans and a new generation to join when asked who ya gonna call
Jul 14 2016,positive,ghostbusters    my grade b      let me lay all my cards out on the table and say that this was a movieremake i was not looking forward to long before the casting direction was made the ghostbusters was a big part of my childhood and to see it rebootedremade to me was just an appalling cashgrab from sony especially given how theyve handled the property for the last 25 years in regards to a genuine sequel as a gateway for a new franchise until they pretty much strongarmed ivan reitman to relinquish some control so sony could make the movie they wanted to make and want they wanted to make was a cinematic universe because thats all the range now    universal has the monsters universe which they want to revisitstartup again fox has the xmen disney has marvel and warner brothers has dc sonys tried and tried to get something going with the fantastic four and spiderman but keep fumbling the ball originally on thirddown with the raimi spiderman then on seconddown with the spiderman reboot and then they got to second down with the fantastic four went to thirddown and fumbled for negative yardage so sony really really wants a franchise here and thats very apparent during the production company logos at the beginning of the movie where one of them is ghost corps the cinematic universe sony wants to build here around the ghostbusters involving multiple different films franchises of the ghostbusters around the country and kiddie films around slimer and his spectral girlfriend     with this movie being the proverbial iron man in this desire i dont think theyre going to get much traction its likely well see a sequel or maybe a spinoff but i doubt were going to see the disneymarvellike expandedcinematic universe sony wants     much has been discussed and said about this movie over the last yearandhalftwoyears since paul feig took the reigns and began his storyworldbuilding and the sony hackleak revealed many of the fears and concerns people had with the way sony wanted to move forward with this without tying it to the original movies or using the original cast passing the torch to a new batch of ghostbusters and as has been abundantly clear the last couple years going with an allfemale ghostbusting team as is fairly par for feig going with all female main casts really stirred up some tempers among misogynistic assholes across the internet    but internet come on did you expect anything else    for me it felt like an odd route to go as opposed to a mixedgender team with male and female ghostbusters working together as equals with equal experience or scientific backgroundsaptitude but whatever as setphotos and eventually movie clips and trailers came out my concerns grew as the movie just did not look funny and the humor in it broad and obvious and the look of the movie just didnt have the proper tone     if you watch the 1984 original that be a pure horrorthriller had it not had comedic moments in it and starred men largely known for comedic work from the trailers it seemed like this movie was going for the broad humor common to comedies these days    so what have we got    the movie starts with a coldopen of sorts with a tour guide leading tourists through some historic mansion or museum and he delivers a few jokes that fall flat in his speaking of the history of the abusive slaveowning famous former resident of the mansion and this eventually leads into his encounter with the purported ghost who haunts the mansion which the tour ordinarily brings alive with parlor tricks at this point i was already sortof concerned as the jokes being made were too frequent and the opening scene just didnt have that same eerie atmosphere to it that the opening scene of the original movie had with librarian encountering the librarian ghost in the basement of the main new york public library     the curator of the mansion goes to meet with kristen wiigs character erin gilbert who in her college years cowrote a book about ghosts with her now estranged friend abby melissa mccarthy but shes now a respected physicist wanting tenure at columbia university shes shocked to see the book has actually been published apparently done without her permission by her former friend gilbert refuses to help the curator and goes to confront abby at another college where old tempers sortof flare up and she meets abbys partner holtzman kate mckinnon the two have been furthering research and trying to find solid proof on the existence of ghosts when they learn of the museum ghost they rush over to investigate where erin joins and they have their encounter with the ghost there     eventually all three lose their respective positions at their colleges due to their investigation of the paranormal but decide to startup their own operation to research and find evidence of ghosts realizing they need to capture one for study and as proof to the scientific community they use devices made by holtzman in hopes to do so meanwhile a nyc subway worker has her own encounter with a ghost in a subway tunnel and is surprisingly unimpressed by it but goes to gilbert and co to help them capture the ghost wanting to know herself what is going on the capture is unsuccessful but it gives them the information they need to move forward with better equipment and training eventually leading them to actually capturing ghosts in a public event combating them is the mayor and homeland security who know of the existence of ghosts but have tried to keep it under wraps for the good of the public    they hire a dim male secretary for no reason other than gilbert finds him hunky and theres no other applicants through all of this is a bellboy at a hotel whos building the devices to lure the ghosts in from the otherside in hopes of ushering in an apocalypse because hes been treated poorly by society his whole life     overall  the movies not as bad as i had feared some of actually sortof works when the movie is doing the scary stuff or an action piece or trying to be serious it works fairly well and is entertaining its common for movies these days to have protracted action scenes and here it works and doesnt grow old too fast nor is it too filled with explosions and action to the point of numbing your brain even during these action pieces the humor tapers itself down to tolerable levels but thats the problem when the movies trying to broader humor it doesnt work and is too much and id say the movie is 5050 when it comes to those two aspects     wiigs character is very good as the stiff who needs to relax a bit and accept the things going on around her and that this is her destiny in life mckinnon is fabulous as their quirky technologycreator whos pretty much loving every moment of her life seriously every time shes on the screen its a treat    chris hemsworth does pretty good as their dim secretary kevin but his one of the broad humor aspects of the movie that doesnt work itd be one thing if he was portrayed as your stereotypical dumb hunky guy but his character is one lost braincell away from needing to wear a helmet at all times when they meet him he says he wears glasses without lenses in them because they got dirty and its easier for him to rub his eyes this way and when hes told to not listen to a private conversation or when something loud happens he squints hard or covers his eyes yes hes so dumb he thinks in order to stop hearing things you close your eyes    its sortof like joey in the tv series friends in the first couple seasons joey was simply dim obviously not smart but clearly capable of being a competent enough person to operate autonomously in society without needing someone to follow him around and make sure he doesnt run into a wall as the series went on and all of the characters various personality traits grew stronger chandler is a sarcastic insecure jackass ross is a overbearing nerdy jackass monica is very clean phoebe is a dim hippie rachel is sortof stuckup joey grew dumber and dumber to the point where it was a wonder this guy isnt in a special home somewhere as opposed to be out and about where he could hurt himself something as innocent as a plastic spoon hemsowrths kevin is where joey would be if friends was still running today in another scene he says he cant answer the phone because its in an aquarium pointing to phone used as an aquarium decoration not realizing the phone sitting right next to him on the otherside of his head thus the sound coming to a different ear is the one ringing ive spent a lot talking about his character but his dumbness is a large example of the type of humor that doesnt click for me in this movie    then theres melissa mccarthy whose humor is more miss than hit with me and this is a miss again very broad humor and much of it involving her yelling and getting into slapsticky situations     that leaves leslie joness character patty whos our layperson in the movie even though theres little need for one here in the original movie winston is the layperson so our expert characters have someone to explain things to thus explaining things to the audience in a natural way patty doesnt quite serve that roll here because the movie doesnt take its pseudoscience nearly as seriously as the original did nor is presented in a way that the audience need it explained to them the characters encounter technology and new equipment they themselves need explained to them so the role of a audienceinsert layperson is redundant and her purpose in the movies narrative is fairly minor she just sort of tags along and inserts herself into the group and they go along with it because she can get them a car but a car borrowed from her uncle and which they cannot modify to suit their needs as she freaks out when the car eventually is modified    well i guess theres also our villain whos really just sort of there things could be read into that hes a lonely man obsessed with ending society for being picked on so much but whatever its just such a contrast to the original where there was no corporeal villain and the antagonist was the very things our protagonists were fighting i dont see why this movie felt the need to give us a human villain     again the movie is hit and miss and its hard to say if one takes over the other enough to say whether or not this movie is a see or not see because neither really overpowers the other enough to push one way or another the bad parts of say independence day resurgence overpowers the good enough that that is a movie to wait for maybe rental or netflix streaming     captain america civil war is pretty much all hit so going to see it in theaters was a must     here were in the middle if you think the movie looked good youre not likely to be disappointed as there is some good here if you think the movie looked bad id say your worries are overblown because this movie isnt nearly as bad as it could have been considering the way the trailers presented it as being pretty much all broad slapstick humor and considering the history of remakesreboots of older properties     does that mean go see it ehhh yeah go see it its actually mostly enjoyable and the humor and bad in it doesnt quite overpower the good in it a lot of the broader humor doesnt work theres plenty of times theyre doing a joke and they pull the snl thing of keeping on running it into the ground the opening scene about the previous owner of the mansion an encounter with the head of the school abby works for a discussion in the mayors office about a common idiom until its unrecognizable as a joke but the action parts moreorless work pretty good there seems like theres supposed to be a character arc going on between abby and erin but it feels like some of it got cut out so we see the buildup on a second animosity between them but never really see that next fightfalling out and jump right to the resolutionrekindling twice    but id almost say the movie is worth seeing for mckinnons character alone the one odd part with her is in the trailers pretty much everything else she does and says is fantastic     so my concerns were mostly eased the trailers greatly mispresented this movie as its not nearly as obvious and broad as they suggest the movie still has problems when it comes to the humor in it and your tolerance levels for mccarthy and to a lesser extent james but its not more than one can handle    i could stand watching this again ifwhen it shows up on netflix or something im unlikely to buy it on bluray its possible ill see it in theaters again if a friend wants to go see it     but there it is the most controversial movie in the last two years hits theaters and it sort of hits with a soft pat rather than with a thud or roar    oh one other critique the cgi ghosts in the movie arent too fantastic and pretty consistent with what is scene in the trailers too cartoonish and colorful when we meet slimer he looks like he just came from the actual cartoon show as opposed to ethereal translucent specter he was in the original and theres a former or lead villain takes thats a literal cartoon     of note theres a series of during animated credit sequences a cut dance number sequence from the nearclimax of the film during the scrolling credits and a postcredits scene     one mild insult the dedication to harold ramis is at the literal end of the credits just before the postcredits scene rather than somewhere more notable though there is a nice cameo of him in the movi itself
Jul 14 2016,neutral,although it is very rare for a film to benefit from a remake ghostbusters seems like a property that if done correctly could expand on the fun of the original and build a world worth exploring sadly even with the talents involved in melissa mccarthy kristen wiig kate mckinnon leslie jones and chris hemsworth ghostbusters is nothing but a remake that banks off the name although there are a few enjoyable sequences following four women erin abby jillian and holtzmann as ghosts begin to arise in the city they begin to meet each other and realize all of their true callings while hunting down and trapping ghosts does not seem realistic even in the context of the film it is something than a few of them had dreamed of as kids much of these elements are present in the original film so i was on the lookout for expansions does this film improve anything on the original is it funny lets talk ghostbusters    from the very first mention of a femalelead ghostbusters film i found myself very nervous on the idea seeing as people complain about not enough female hollywood characters in general i was worried if it was a publicity stunt or whether it was going to be handled with care toward the franchise happily this film does try pretty hard to make itself stand on its own creating new characters for fans of the franchise to enjoy but that is where the care sadly ends even though the film tries to sell you on this female team it doesnt make much sense when the original cast pops up in random cameos playing other people aside from their original roles    so no i do not believe this film was needed but i did admire the attempt at bringing back the franchise for a new generation unlike films like independence day resurgence earlier this year it does not completely bank off its name to sell tickets it does take care of characters its character development and buildup to the big climax but even though it all seems wellpaced out the conclusion is nothing too spectacular it leaves fans wanting so much more    being a fan of the original ghostbusters film there was one thing i was hoping for from this film that felt very absent in my opinion proper comedy between the team members in the original film every actor had their moment to shine especially bill murray with extremely cheesy oneliners and stupid dialogue the jokes worked in context with the film in serious moments characters would keep a straight face while saying a dumb line of dialogue adding a bit of dry humour for the mature viewers this film had absolutely none of that providing dated references and dumb slapstick most of the time however the highlights of the film that did work for me was the addition of chris hemsworth as their secretary and some standout moments from kate mckinnon    hiring a secretary based solely on how goodlooking he is is kind of humorous but his dumb characteristics played perfectly throughout the entire duration by chris hemsworth was hilarious he has many funny lines of dialogue and has quite a few moments to shine here while kate mckinnon on the other hand can be slightly repetitive with her performance i found her to be hysterical her facial gestures and random outbursts made me chuckle quite a few times but it eventually got a little much for the film to handle although these actors give it their all not all of them worked for me as the usually do    melissa mccarthy and kristen wiig are both great performers but they were played more serious this time around and when they were ready to give their big punchlines it felt like the lack of an rrating was holding them back unlike the original this film is completely kidfriendly making for a few cringeworthy gags i am choosing to leave out leslie jones character solely due to the fact that she felt kind of neutral to me she had her moments like hemsworth and mckinnon but she also fell pretty flat in a few instances as for the spectacle in the film i would say it delivers    after hitormiss jokes throughout the film introducing a lacklustre villain and having random cameos to call back the original film we finally reach the big climax in the city the ghostbusters must band together to take down the city filled with ghosts and while it feels like a pretty short sequence each cast member had their moment to shine kate mckinnon is given some of the best scenes throughout the big battle and it is probably the most memorable part of the film it is just bigger than the original without being better    overall ghostbusters tries very hard to rejuvenate the franchise and while it is not a bad film in any way there really isnt anything that screams memorable i enjoy these actresses so if they were to ever make a sequel i believe they can come up with an original storyline and leave the original cast alone there are far too many callbacks too many cheesy gags and the pgrating definitely hurts the film in my opinion in the end will it please fans i would say both yes and no simultaneously is it a fun flick about women crushing ghosts sure is it a bad comedy yes some of the jokes hit some of the action is fun and the performances are enjoyable enough to warrant seeing them again i do not think the horrible amounts of backlash toward this film is warranted but it doesnt really prove anyone wrong either it is a mixed feelings type of movie can i recommend it to hardcore fans of the original and kids sure
Jul 14 2016,positive,the trailer wasnt very good but we just came back from seeing the movie and it was excellent quite funny and the cgi was well done like i always say never trust a trailer lol there have been a lot of great movies with bad trailers and a lot of bad movies with great trailers you just never know
Jul 14 2016,positive,these ladies never disappoint and the cameos were a great treat ill see it again
Jul 14 2016,positive,strangely this movie wasnt all that bad
Jul 14 2016,positive,its cheesy and funny and haters gunna hate but the female ghostbusters are kickass loved it
Jul 14 2016,positive,ghostbusters 2016 is not a cookie cutter reboot of the original the characters have fun unique personalities and the story line is completely different it was a treat for my wife and i to see it in theater and it pays homage to the original actors a must see in my books
Jul 14 2016,positive,ghostbusters was lots of fun very entertaining i docked a star because    1 kate mckinnon wasnt gay enough come on studio really  2 they either should have made 35 more jokes at the direct expense of men or they should have made some of the minor characters women too  3 too many cameos distracted from actual content though honestly i can deal with this one because i assume most kids watching the movie wont recognize them as cameos  wont be distracted by them  4 seriously kate mckinnon wasnt gay enough
Jul 14 2016,positive,loved it  i liked the cameos the surprise at the end the humor the chemistry between the actors  chris hemsworth was funny and kristen wiig being smitten with him was adorable  the energy in the audience was great and they all seem to enjoy it too  i look forward to seeing it again
Jul 14 2016,positive,ghostbusters its been 32 years since the now iconic predecessor hit theaters around the globe so director paul feig had some pretty big shoes to fill with this reboot  fortunately he gets a big boost from his two muses melissa mccarthy and kristen wiig and even bigger boosts from snl newcomers leslie jones and kate mckinnon who steal the show there are loads of laughs even chris hemsworth kills it the special efforts are top notch some particularly 3d worthy and the frequent homages to the original film are a nice touch the only drawbacks  the cute story does lag a bit and more often than not the comedy feels restrained and doesnt really go for it while not quite as good as the original its still very well done b
Jul 14 2016,positive,overall enjoyable though not without issues the film started off strong with several wonderful lines delivered by zach woods from there we are introduced to the soon to be ghostbusters the writing and execution continue to please wiig is convincing in her professional role about half an hour in the film begins to slow down and falter though never so much as to fall apart the premise holds together well but too many side stories are introduced bogging down the movie things come together at the end though predictably the only real letdown was a late scene which switches from busting ghosts to more of a melee which seems out of sorts overall an enjoyable film
Jul 14 2016,positive,second best movie of the summer
Jul 14 2016,positive,funny movie  had me laughing most of the movie  i would recommend ghostbusters to everyone
Jul 14 2016,positive,the whole family loved it i actually started crying towards the end because i was thinking about how much harold ramis would have loved it and then at the end of the creditsi cried some more we loved the surprise cameos the honor paid to the old beloved characters and welljust all of it  it does have some crude jokes a bit of cussing and a few jump scares but overall it wasnt any worse than most of the superhero or action films out there if you are a fan of the original you will not be disappointed in this fresh and funny reboot
Jul 14 2016,negative,awful and an epic failure not funny at all and the storyline is horrible hollywood just made this movie to cash in on the name absolutely no thought went into it
Jul 14 2016,negative,overall good movie not great the special effects are great to see it in 3d there are some good laughs light humor the movie could have used more comedy i liked paul feign last two movies but this one is on the button you dont need to see it in theaters just wait for the blue ray by the way chris hemsworth was the best part of the movie
Jul 14 2016,positive,the main cast was very funny the plot was just okay wouldve been better if it was shorter
Jul 14 2016,negative,no plot   horrible editing there were scenes that literally jumped all over the place and had no continuity  the only somewhat humorous scenes you already saw in the previews  cliche and cheesy use of original stars as cameos    i kept wishing for it to be over i didnt walk out cause i took my daughter to see it     to me it was like watching a stand up comic start off kind of funny and then watch in embarrassment as they make an ass of themselves thats what this movie was an ass walking off stage with tomatoes thrown at it     it was embarrassing to watch
Jul 14 2016,positive,very decent stand alone which does succeed in relation to the original ghostbusters comparatively this version has more character development and more gadgets and a bigger build up to the finale chris hemsworth pretty much steals each scene he is inplus the end credits most of the original cast appear in fun cameos try not to sit in front of people who bring their eight kids stay until the end of the credits
Jul 14 2016,positive,not even close to being as good as the original but better than the second  not as funny as i hoped and it didnt get me excited for future ghostbuster movies but im not dreading the inevitable sequel s with this cast i felt that wiig mccarthy and mckinnon werent as funny as i expected but hemsworth and leslie jones were much better than i thought theyd be
Jul 14 2016,positive,how hard would it be to remake a classic like ghostbusters were talking about a massive undertaking here instead of remake the original movie they made something new and different yet familiar enough for original fans i had serious doubts but they pulled it off in a big way is it as good as the original of course not but it was way better than part 2 i will see it again and own it
Jul 14 2016,negative,horrible boring movie
Jul 14 2016,positive,the new ghostbusters is not nearly as terrible as the backlash was whether you are in support of remakesreboots or completely against them they are inevitable granted it isnt paul feig and mccarthys best film its a fun and harmless time waster like any good remake it pays respect to the original with surprise cameos from the original cast and returning faces such as slimer and stay puft with a little bit of a shaky start some jokes are hit and miss the end show off in nyc makes up for some of its short comings but end of the day ghostbusters isnt an amazing film but it really isnt bad either
Jul 14 2016,positive,in recent memory there hasnt been as much controversy surrounding a movie as there was for this femaleled reboot with both outrage at the gender swap and apprehension over a beloved 80s cinematic artefact being somehow ruined neither concern warranted the vitriolic online attacks of course especially as were talking about a lighthearted supernatural comedy and after seeing the movie always the best time to judge a film in my opinion its pretty damn good not an exact remake of the original but sticking close to the broad plot strokes ghostbusters 16 puts less emphasis on reinventing the story and more on injecting its own kooky spin to the inherently playful tone there is an impressive range of gags working on multiple levels some hilariously slapstick and others more subtly tongueincheek with director paul feig even squeezing in a couple of fantastic metajokes having a dig at the aforementioned fan backlash although this version is clearly comfortable in its own skin it also slyly calls back to previous outings with cheeky references logo vehicle hq and numerous cameos the latter ultimately a mixed bag though at times it is also genuinely spooky on a pgrated level the precredits sequence is an especially effective spinetingler however the larger the supernatural presence the less frightening it becomes where this flick hits its biggest homerun is in casting the new evilspirit fighting quartet share a wonderful chemistry melissa mccarthys optimistically rambunctious abby kristen wiigs cautiously nerdy erin kate mckinnons confidently cool jillian and leslie jones assuredly streetwise patty make a cracking team mckinnon steals the show though the long time saturday night live alumni is a revelation in her first major film role whilst also nabbing the most memorable moment with a totally badass action sequence in which she singlehandedly takes down a string of ghouls its certainly not perfect  the rote citydestroying finale and lame villain ensure that  but its an exciting and funny adventure that proves to be a worthy modern update and its ten times better than ghostbusters 2 ever was
Jul 14 2016,positive,ghostbusters is back its not bad at all get used to it
Jul 14 2016,positive,just saw ghostbusters and really enjoyed the new cast especially kate mckinnon and leslie jones  stay true to the original premise and lots of laughs to be had  they all looked like they had fun with this so dont micro pick it over but just have fun with it as well
Jul 14 2016,positive,wow a review from someone who actually saw the movie   this movie was so funny and action packed it honored the first movie without copying it leslie jones has a fantastic part smart funny and not just an after thought   the chemistry between the cast was fabulous laughed the entire time 
Jul 14 2016,positive,very funny paid homage to the original but with an updated story  great visuals
Jul 14 2016,neutral,way over the top minimal comedy mediocre acting boring storyline with ok theatrics wait for release on regular television
Jul 14 2016,positive,casting was  amazing the main four are hilarious  the movie hit all the right notes fans of the original movies will be pleased
Jul 14 2016,neutral,the new ghostbusters movie what can i say about it well is not a great movie but is not a horrible movie it walks a fine line between good and bad but for what is worth it was and entertaining movie
Jul 14 2016,positive,okay i liked the movie did i trigger you alright if your still here i see your generally interested in this review also this is no spoilers i dont want to ruin it for you    the movie was not anywhere near perfect but keep in mine i dont have the mindset like a critic would have i was debating a score between 3 and 4 but since 35 wasnt an option i went ahead and gave it a 4     the bad some of this movies humor really isnt what makes me think of ghostbusters so you get stuff like fart jokes the movie is not a continuation of the original movies and really it couldve been a lot better if it was and with that came a lot of plot copying thankfully the movie wasnt word per word but it wouldve been nice to have more originality the ghostbusters theme was not what i expected and it was not a good thing either    the good i feel like the ghostbusters got really well together and was definitely nice seeing them interact and kate mckinnon was really good in this movie she was hilarious and while i complained about the jokes in the movie there are still some really good ones in the movie that made me laugh the cameos for the original cast was excellent and spotting them in the movie is really worth going to see it while the times square scene got a lot of hate in the trailer i really liked it and a lot of people complained about the ghosts cgi in the trailer but i really liked it the movie even pokes fun about the amount of people that disliked the trailer i loved the transformation with the main villain but i really dont want to spoil it also stay after the credits not going to tell you anything about it just stay    overall this was a fun experience and while it may not live up to the original its still is a fun adventurethats very similar to the originalthat i think everybody should see unless your hardcore fan that thinks it needs to be a masterpiece like the original or for some reason are against the idea of ghostbusters being woman then dont see it
Jul 14 2016,neutral,the good     kate mckinnon and leslie jones are the clear standouts mckinnon puts on a  wacky and electric performance and was easily my favorite character in the film leslie jones delivered a good amount of chuckles both were constantly amusing     chris hemsworth is entertaining     i chuckled throughout the film     doesnt feel like a 2 hour film    the 3d was fun    generally a fun and entertaining film      the bad     its poorly made feels like it was done with little thought effort love or care     there is barely a plot     the main villain is weak limp nonthreatening poorly developed and generally completely forgettable     our ghostbusters characters are weakly developed with little character     there are many references and similarities to the original all of which dont feel like they belong here the structure and plot are weak retreads theres an old hotel which has ages of creepy history behind it none of which is explored this is clearly the standin for the apartment building in the original  our characters are pale shadows or outlines of our original crew none of the cameos from our original cast work in fact id say we didnt really need cameos in this at all     our new ghostbusters refer to themselves as ghost girls at times cute catchy nicknamebut why      the editing is awful and the film suffers from some pacing issues     feels like a childrens saturday morning cartoon ironically the real ghostbusters cartoon is better than this film as well feels like the whole thing is geared towards the young     the ghost effects feel like nickelodeon movie cgi     not once did i want to be a part of this new ghostbusters group     paul feig was the wrong person to create this film his trademark adlibbedimprov type of humor doesnt work all that well and just feels off here    fails as a ghostbusters film    we dont need a ghostbusters franchise and i dont want one    summary     ghostbusters 2016 cant hold a candle to the original but did anyone really expect it to the original ghostbusters is a timeless classic and it would be foolish to try to match it let alone hope to beat it to this films credit its not trying to do that its main goal seems to be to make money and to have some fun  ghostbusters 2016 is unconcerned with plot or character and it feels as if made for kids that said i did find a good deal of the humor chuckleworthy  i really loved kate mckinnon in it i couldnt get enough of her character and leslie jones was great too loved her reactions to some of the events and ghosts i was surprised to find that i had a good deal of fun while watching this film ghostbusters 2016 isnt really a bad film its fairly harmless a good deal colorful and lively and it serves up some possible new heroes for little girls i say possible because im not sure exactly how popular these ghost girls are going to be kids will likely enjoy the film and id say theres a chance adults could find something to enjoy here too dont quote me on that though it may not be well made and fails to find a reason to justify its existence but in the end ghostbusters 2016 was still entertaining and fun id say you could save some money and rent it on bluray or dvd later because seeing it in a theater doesnt add all that much to the film and i cant see how dishing out the extra cash for imax would benefit the film at all
Jul 14 2016,negative,for harold ramis fills the screen after the end credits roll what a horrible tribute this film is for our beloved egon the laughs are few and far between unless youre easily amused however i did laugh a few times mostly because of the ridiculous kevin pre possession the ladies have great chemistry and are silly and not funny silly you know when youre upset and someone goes out of their way to cheer you up kinda like that trying too hard annoying silly also the repeated gags plot elements and cameos try too hard to cater to gb fans but by the time you see dan aykoyd or a recycled gag you just dont care and your nostalgia is offended also stay past the credits for more eye roll worthy sequel setup playing to the crowd assuming you make it through the dance number anyway this reboot is forgettable and not what gb fans and potential new fans deserved the films tagline suggests that you answer the call youll wish you had let it go the voicemail
Jul 14 2016,positive,very funnystill with his faults in  the editionand a story not so great
Jul 14 2016,positive,okay summer comedy could have been better if someone bothered to write a story instead of a loose collection of jokes and references kate mckinnon was the best part and im hoping this launches her career further if nothing else
Jul 14 2016,positive,i am pleased to report that the movie is much better than the trailers the movie doesnt feel like a parody or spoof which was my biggest concern there is a decent level of suspense and fear which was my other concern the neon ghosts are more tolerable within the content of the film there is an after credits scene at the very end of the movie the credits themselves are fun to watch too lots of cameos i give the movie an a rating remember my ratings are based more on my enjoyment than technical execution try to see it for yourselves because unfair negative comments and reviews have already begun to spread like wildfire    the film still doesnt make up its mind on whether it is just ghostbusters or ghostbusters answer the call though oh well
Jul 14 2016,neutral,some good laughs but some of the characters seem forced  kristen wiig and chris hemsworth were great
Jul 14 2016,positive,i was expecting a terrible movie as the trailers were mostly awful and unfunny however this movie surprised me as it is a good time like all of paul feigs movies it is hit and miss in the comedy however the parts that do land are funny and the action pieces are enjoyable enough the cast is pretty even throughout with standouts being kate mckinnon and chris hemsworth this isnt nearly as good as the original and not as bad as the second one its just in the middle its a fun movie with some good jokes and action with a awkward ending cameos are for the most part great
Jul 14 2016,positive,i think it was funnier than the original ghostbusters but not better than the original hold a special place in my heart as a scary movie that was funny this was a comedy first and had some scares the funny is where these actors shine it is not  a must see movie but a worth the price of admission i cant speak to the influence and meaning it will have for girls and woman but i loved the strength and comedic timing of the woman in this movie
Jul 14 2016,negative,trash horrible stupid movie
Jul 14 2016,positive,turn your brain off and enjoy
Jul 14 2016,positive,not as good as the original but still a fun popcorn movie see it in 3d
Jul 14 2016,positive,it was amazing  kate mckinnon is awesome  see it in imax 3d
Jul 14 2016,positive,stay through the entire credits
Jul 14 2016,neutral,while not quite the mass hysteria of biblical proportions as expected ghostbusters v20 still fails more than it succeeds atmospherically it keeps close to the original source material but the script or lack thereof keeps the film from ever popping out of first gear the surprising aspect of the film and only reason to watch theatrically is the outstanding use of 3d framing if feig wouldve put as much effort into the script as he did with staging 3d effects youd have the odd remake which stands toe to toe with the original
Jul 14 2016,positive,after all the antihype after all the hate and even after the high expectations from fans of paul feig and his regulars the new ghostbusters is ultimatelypretty good not great unfortunately but genuinely a ton of fun what i was hoping for were belly laughs and what i got instead were chuckles in the service of a and entertaining and fairly predictable plot
Jul 14 2016,positive,better than the originals
Jul 14 2016,positive,perfect in every way
Jul 14 2016,positive,very nicely done its rare that someone can make a good second movie to such a good franchise
Jul 14 2016,positive,355 stars 710 b  humour was 5050 but it was very fun and the action was amazing
Jul 14 2016,positive,hilarious amazing characters and many nods to the original movie without being an exact remake absolutely delightful and thoroughly entertaining
Jul 14 2016,positive,aside from a few flaws the movie is very well done and i hope to see a sequel
Jul 14 2016,negative,i dont understand how this movie is receiving such praise from rtunless someones palms are being greased   are we watching the same movie i was actually defending the movie when it was receiving a lot of criticism during marketing  im actually surprised at how unsatisfied i am with the final product  for a movie that was being touted as a platform to empower women in lead roles the 4 main characters were empty stereotypes more akin to cartoon characters than a legitimate live action movie   they felt like they were too in on the joke and this sort of approach unlike the original made the entire experience feel cheapened and shallow  word of advice if you want to push a message that empowers women dont stereotype their characters while cheapening male roles  it sabotages the movement to see more lead female  roles attracting a wider audience because it feels like in order to level the playing field the had to cast every make character as an asshole an idiot or a sociopath  the sad thing is somehow inadvertently chris hemsworth steals the show and he did almost nothing but portray a complete idiot   my final verdict dont pay to see this movie let your wallet send the message to hollywood that they should be held accountable for poorly written and thought out movies  for the record im a fan of most of the directors work as well as a massively big fan of mccarthy  there were some amazing parts in this movie particularly the beginning  but all it really did was get your hopes up for a big let down
Jul 14 2016,positive,it was fun i enjoyed it as much as the first one i personally think that the cameos from past characters we not necessary this movie could have stood on its own it wont when any awards or break any box office records but who cares it was fun to watch i think what bothered me the most was them trying to please people from the past and i think those things got in the way not all sequel have to include the past its worth seeing and kate mckinnon is the best ghost buster ever
Jul 14 2016,positive,hilarious the whole cast was wonderful great job casting chris hemsworth
Jul 14 2016,positive,funny not a classic but funny not deserving of the troll hatefest
Jul 14 2016,positive,it really isnt fair to compare this movie to the original but at the same time its naturally difficult not to especially if you grew up with the original movies and loved them that being said though i watched the original movies growing up i wasnt exactly a fan of them i liked the first one well enough and didnt really care at all for the second one so i went into this remakereboot with neutral thoughts and feelings and no expectations i was simply curious to see what this new movie had to offer and by the time the credits rolled i found myself pleasantly surprised by how much i smiled laughed and enjoyed this movie its certainly not without flaws just like any movie but some movies have more flaws than others and this movie has a pretty big chunk of them granted some of these flaws can be easily forgivable but if flaws in a movie are obviously unnecessaryeasily fixable and if they take you out of the movie and hold the movie back from reaching its full potential well then i find it very difficult to be anything but frustrated annoyed and disappointed and i cant ignore them or forget them and thus i refuse to forgive them too suffice it to say ghostbusters is fun funny entertaining and highly enjoyable i really liked this movie but its also disappointing and frustrating ghostbusters should have and could have been a great supernatural comedy but in the end its just decent its fine its kind of good definitely not terrible or deserving of any hate whatsoever but it also doesnt deserve any praise either i do recommend seeing it in the theaters though especially in imax 3d i give ghostbusters a c
Jul 14 2016,positive,this is silly not being sexist  but  ghost busters are origanly guys so this  is not a reboot this is something new  should have another name daughters of the ghostbuster  or mrsghostbusters id still watch it  but this ant ghost busters freddy krueger was still freddy krueger
Jul 14 2016,positive,ghostbusters goes the right direction in having the respectable tone it needed with the characters really becoming likeable and a refreshing change for a sci fi action comedy the worst parts of the movie are those that are in the trailer making it clear these goofs were more to draw people in rather than showcase what the film is about which is both fortunate for the movie and unfortunate for its advertising the new gags are clever and funny while the ghost busting action is pretty fun with the main flaws being its cliched villain and forced story plots that appear mid way through the movie ghostbusters does enough to entertain pay homage to the original and hopefully set the groundwork for a strong sequel
Jul 14 2016,negative,awful terrible worthless waste of time and money insulting offensive 100 trash do not waste your time with this piece of garbage     we deserve better
Jul 14 2016,negative,man hating the movie seriously besides it being completely unfunny every single man is either an idiot or evil they even kill the main baddy by shooting it in the dick no seriously    all the girl power crap comes off as incredibly forced because it is and even if you are the kind of cretin that likes the idea of tumblr  the movie even you wont like it because all youre doing is showing yourselves up and really whiny unfunny and really rather pathetic    to rub salt in the tumblrites wounds the only funny one in the entire movie is the white guy they were trying ever so hard to demean by casting in the role of secretary    there is absolutely no reason to see this movie at all
Jul 14 2016,positive,i saw this movie yesterday and surprisingly thought it was good ghostbusters 1 still the king     7810 summer movie rating for me    second act suffered by weird cuts and bad acting by hemsworth otherwise good fun movie characters were one dimensional and jokes and movie were not as dark as the original everything was more based towards sexual innuendos and sexuality overall you can see all of the original ghostbusters and more as well in cameosthing     second act probably had the only real good parts for 3d i saw it in 2d credits had scenes that were probably cut from the movie which worked pretty well for the end credits and definitely would have ruined the movie if it was a part of it there is also an aftercredits scene as well    watching it felt like a reimagening of the original than an actual full reboot per se which is what this movie will suffer the most from
Jul 14 2016,negative,all these arguments about sexism and girl power the entire movie all the do is make jokes about wanting to see chris hemsworths dick real good role model for girls make them all drooling school girls over a handsome guy   this movie was awful
Jul 14 2016,negative,yep lost all faith in rotten tomatoes used to be a go to nonbiased site this just proves that you cant trust any critics they are all bought and sold at a drop of a hat now that being said the movie isnt horrible there are far worse movies out there but it is a lazy blatant cash grab bridesmaids reskinned basically
Jul 14 2016,positive,i am a huge fan of the original ghost busters and i went to see it with my 13 year old brother who hasnt seen the original both of us loved it and were laughing out loud through out the film it was far better than i expected i dont think the trailer does it justice
Jul 14 2016,positive,just saw the movie it was great and different enough than the original i enjoyed it had a great time i loved kate mckinnon holtzmann character
Jul 14 2016,positive,the trailer didnt do it justice i watched with great scepticism and was very surprised it was funny it was bad ass it had a solid story and incredible acting from kate mckinnon
Jul 14 2016,negative,stale jokes raunchy humouran unimaginative remake  would be nice if hollywood tried something new for a change
Jul 14 2016,positive,its not the original thats the biggest complaint about ghostbusters remake  its fine for what it is and has some moments but it isnt great and it isnt terrible  its one of those movies that if there was no original it would be fine but when you hold it up to that higher standard its a dumpster fire  the comedic females leads carry what ordinarily would be just an average script
Jul 14 2016,positive,my wife and i will be watching it this friday night cant wait
Jul 14 2016,negative,aykroyd spends over a decade to get a real sequel made only to get ignored and bill wont answer his phone until after we lose harold  some asshat makes a joke about this team and its rushed into production in under six months these women arent even funny yet are treated as hip hilarious and hot when they are far from it loud and screeching does not equal funny id rather watch cr4pt4stic on loop for a week straight clockwork orange style than watch this dreck
Jul 14 2016,negative,bab bad bad bad bad dont waste your money or more preciously your time too many ways to count how bad this really is
Jul 14 2016,negative,who and i mean who sat at a board room table and said this script and actors should make this film sad pathetic non humorous why the original was creative and not only that but allowed the imagination to flow the original characters were thought out and strategically picked not this crap of hey lets get most of saturday nights lineup as the original was lucky to have two great players as main characters cause of their ingenious ability this new rendition of we wish we could be like the original fell as far in the depths of the grand canyon as it could first im sorry to say but the creators could have placed men and women on the ghostbusters team 2x2 not 4 women and a super hero actor trying to play a secretary  the story was more like the studio trying to prove women are equal and the world already knows we all want equal in rights this not only let down the generation that loved ghostbusters but destroyed the chance of the new generation to like them kids will not be reaching out to buy toys like years past and halloween will not make costumes big again nor will anyone be asking for toys from this so call stand alone sequel for christmas  until next time only the bad shal fear my name
Jul 14 2016,positive,just sensational funny witty and clever and the sad part is that so many people are determined to hate it truly tragic
Jul 14 2016,neutral,neither terrible nor awesome it just exists and that is more upsetting than a bad film
Jul 14 2016,negative,didnt see it just know its bad
Jul 14 2016,positive,loved this movie so much despite all the harsh critics it got online i went to see it hoping it wouldnt be too bad well i was pleasently surprised altough i am a fan of the originals i grew up with them i found this so much fun laughed the whole way through loved the humour and all the references to the original movies great way to relaunch the franchise for a younger audience too
Jul 14 2016,negative,a shame i cant understand anyone liked it  manbashing movie not funny no chemical magic between characters dick jokes shitty cgwhy 74 why  this is outrageous to the 7th art 
Jul 14 2016,neutral,ok so im just gonna say it its not completely terrible its also not particularly good either like a really girly love letter to the original ghostbusters is funny in parts with some pretty cool bustin scenes but just feels all kinds of wrong with the amount of nods to the originals i just cant understand why a rebootrehash was the way to go because i think the franchise is done now
Jul 14 2016,negative,steaming pile of manure the jokes are poor and characters have no personality whatsoever you can do ghostbusters with women in it as illustrated by the cartoon network series this could have been a serious movie but they chose to make it completely garbage
Jul 14 2016,negative,as a kid ghostbusters was one of my favourite movies it was extremely well written with some lines that still stand out as being genius even today it had some of the best comedians of our generation acting in it as well as a fantastic supporting cast including sigourney weaver and rick moranis its special effects for the time were state of the art and really brought it all together i loved this movie    paul feig just shat all over this    what i watched today was not the ghostbusters that i grew up loving it was the same old rot that hollywood have been shilling for the past number of years as action comedy whoever wrote the script to this movie is a hack and should be ashamed of themselves it comprised of nothing more than fart they went to great pains to point out that it was a front fart poo and other bodily function jokes there was no intelligence in the writing whatsoever this movie was written for 14 year old boys    melissa mccarthy was landed with a running gag of her takeaway order always being wrong do you get it shes fat so its funny hahahahahahahah are we seriously supposed to have to put up with this sort of shit as comedy    why is the pke meter shaped like a neon pink vulva can somebody please explain that to me what is the purpose of this other than the ghostbusters being an all female team why was this even included in the movie    all of the characters in the 80s original had character and personality you cared about them i came out of the cinema not being able to even name the members of the team theres somebody holtzhausen and theres patty somebodyorother i cant even think of the other 2 members names that shows how little i cared for them    what was with the holtzhausen character why was she dressed like a dirty homeless hobo is that what is supposed to pass as quirky or kooky these days    oh look slimer has a girlfriend now why what extra did this bring to the movie    the new theme song by fallout boy and missy elliott can only be described as a an all out assault on my auditory senses and not in a good way music should not be about somebody shouting at me ray parker jr must be shaking his head about now and yes i know the original melody was ripped off a huey lewis song    the only good thing about this movie was chris hemsworth as kevin he was the only shining light in an otherwise turgid unoriginal lazy unfunny excuse for a movie    fuck you paul feig you just ruined ghostbusters
Jul 14 2016,positive,with so many people already having made their minds up about this movie its rather difficult to write a review objectively but i will do my best the cast is great they all do a great job however i found kate mckinnons character grating and obnoxious  believe they were going for humorous the gags with the dumb male secretary were not as funny as the filmmakers thought they were neither were the gags about the delivery guy getting the soup wrong the first twothirds of the movie is completely watchable there are some funny parts and some parts where the jokes fall flat and theres more than one joke about youtubers posting mean comments on their videos which sounded pretty defensive the final third of the movie is pretty bad though some sort of pseudo action film that lifts its ending directly from the first avengers movie substitute ghosts from another dimension for aliens from another dimension like i said its not a bad movie kristen wiig and melissa mccarthy have a lot of chemistry i just wish the writing had been better
Jul 14 2016,negative,crappy plot not worth it
Jul 14 2016,positive,loses its way a bit but still really fun
Jul 14 2016,negative,im simply flabbergasted that anyone would rate this film anything over 1 star  in my opinion its easily the worst movie of the year i cringed my way through it its more like a bad extended sketch that has been thrown together with some decent fx  the actors are as ghastly as the dialogue only wiig has the ability to act  feig convinced most of the original cast to cameo for an easy buck but the cameos are empty and pointless its embarrasing to watch and somehow cheapens the original characters i watch a lot of movies week in week out and id rank this with the turkeys awful just awful
Jul 14 2016,positive,truly special refreshing girls being a team of friends no ass kicking men smart girls being heroic no love interest crap fun fun funny the best 3d since the first new age 3d film i saw that fight scene though
Jul 14 2016,positive,this is the citizen kane of movies
Jul 14 2016,positive,if youre smart enough to know that a fricking reboot is not going to destroy your precious childhood this new version is worth seeing if whats here doesnt quite measure up to its predecessor its more fun than youd expect from a movie unfairly saddled with so many expectations
Jul 14 2016,positive,really enjoyed the movie really fun loved the chemistry between the the actresses kate mckinnon stole the damn show in this movie
Jul 14 2016,negative,if these are your daughters role models i feel sorry for your daughters
Jul 14 2016,positive,one of the best films ive seen all year real funny and appropriately scary dont believe the haters and naysayers that judged this film before even seeing it because of its female cast the cast are perfection as the ghostbusters maybe in the sequel they will widen their busting net to getting rid of internet trolls id give it higher stars but physically cant
Jul 14 2016,positive,kate mckinnon was amazing  so funny  loved it
Jul 14 2016,positive,great fun  my sister and i enjoyed this much more than my husband so it may be sort of an empowered female type movie
Jul 14 2016,positive,it wasnt because the cast was all female which is awesome btw  it was because the script was weak and the i think the movie was too concerned with paying homage that it missed the mark in both departments
Jul 14 2016,negative,bad script bad acting bad effects bad musicbad directing bad editing its your typical sony pictures film no wonder the playstation division is they only thing keeping sony afloat their film division been making garbage for years and ghostbusters in no exception
Jul 14 2016,negative,mediocrity has never been more apt of a word in describing a movie as a whole
Jul 14 2016,negative,should be called manbashers instead horrible
Jul 14 2016,negative,they stop the marshmallow man by shooting at his crotch there now dont go see this agendaforcing cashgrab that does the originals no justice hijacking a beloved series like this is completely reprehensible and nobody involved with this movie should be allowed to work in hollywood ever again disgusting
Jul 14 2016,negative,rip time from my life 
Jul 14 2016,negative,thinly veiled feminist propaganda that ironically borrows most of its jokes from classic man made movies such as jaws and rocky a story about female empowerment that lacks originality that makes the black female character into the exact stereotype feminists fight against loud obnoxious the chemistry between the actresses is abysmal and even though hemsworth was supposed to play the dumb male eye candy stole the show every time he was on screen
Jul 14 2016,positive,everyone was on the bandwagon of hate even before the movie was out   ive followed the busters since i was a 5 and i didnt lose my nutslike those socalled fans  and boy did the movie deliver  imax 3d review below    the cast was actually funny obviously not on a jump street 21 level more of judd apatowyoull enjoy hemsworths character   the cameos of the original cast were a great surprise but they were kinda miscast and underused  the music retained the old theme song so thats a plus  the visuals were amazing with vibrant colors and candylike saturation its been a while since ive seen a 3d movie thats actually popping out like this one did   do yourself a favor and watch it in imax 3d you wont regret it
Jul 14 2016,negative,as hard as they keep trying to push this movie it was terrible the cast was a poor choice it was nothing but crappy one liners strung together if i have to hear another mccarthy fat joke ill lose it its not funny
Jul 14 2016,positive,really enjoyed this one what a fun movie especially in 3d kristin wiig and melissa mccarthy make such a good comedic duo and their schtick is just as hilarious as it was in bridesmaids and chris hemsworth was really funny too playing the terribly nottoobright but great to look at secretarythe reverse of the office gender roles
Jul 14 2016,positive,a hilarious blend of new story  throw backs to the original loved it
Jul 14 2016,neutral,jesus christ im boggled that this movie has a 73 on rotten tomatoes its should have gotten at most a 53 this movie didnt even come close to the original shitty humor no real climatic event
Jul 14 2016,positive,seriously what the hell was all that hate about i was disgusted by all the sexist backlash this film got before it was even released but funnily enough it was all that controversy that made me want to see it    those girls were actually very funny particularly melissa mccarthy and leslie jones and i laughed out loud at more than a few points although i have to say that kate mckinnons character got a bit annoying at times but thats a minor gripe    chris hemsworths character was also very funny a lot of hateful reviews seem to claim he was the only funny thing in a manhating movie which is quite ironic considering the character is essentially a male version of the dumb blonde secretary stereotype next to the smart funny buttkicking women considering hes not a comedian he did a great job in that role and he was clearly having a great time there    but what do i think of it compared to the original both versions are very good films this remake is a great movie in its own right but its almost a shame that its a ghostbusters film because no matter how good it is it will always be unfavourably compared to the original not because of that small but very vocal sexist minority but because its a widely beloved classic and part of many peoples childhoods and they will be naturally very apprehensive about a remake male or female    i personally would love to see more completely original films with funny intelligent buttkicking women in it then that would prove those sexists to be completely wrong because this film was pretty much guaranteed since day one to make a lot of money and being a remake i would imagine some people perceiving it as riding in on the coattails of an already successful franchise which probably didnt do it any favours in terms of public perception regardless of gender    so verdict a very funny and enjoyable film in its own right even fans of the classic could enjoy it so dont try and turn it into a classic vs remake or a male vs female war because theyre both very good films go see this this film and enjoy it for what it is a fun movie that deserves 35 out of 5 stars
Jul 14 2016,positive,amazingly watched laughed and loved it and when i awoke the next morning my blu rays of the original hadnt burst into flame of been stolen by that evil wizard paul feig     dont compare it to the original and dont prejudge it the women are hilarious the jokes are more hit than miss it gives great fan service and was genuinely enjoyable from the opening setup and ray parker jr original song to the closing post credits tease    im a massive ghost head and i bloody loved it
Jul 14 2016,negative,well i saw the movie with my girlfriend it was absolutely terrible it was exactly what the trailer made it look like but 2 hours of it it brought nothing new to the table and stole 100 of its content from the first two movies it wasnt creative the humor was lowbrow and just as everyone suspected it was a feminist soapbox film all the male characters were portrayed as idiots or evil and all the female characters were portrayed as superintelligent and good simply put it was a terrible sexist unoriginal film that does not deserve any attention     it was as bad as movie 43
Jul 14 2016,positive,not bad liked it alot didnt watch the original ghost busters so i cant compare the 2 but i would say the storyline was good really funny throughout they did great balancing the humor and the scaryseriouseww scenes spoiler alert im glad that they gave chris hemsworth two different characters to do that showed off a bit more of his acting cant believe they actually killed off the debunker guy thought that that was meant to be a funny scene not a death scene the first ghost was my favourite gorgeous looked like a celestial being until they turned her face into the skull
Jul 14 2016,positive,haters gonna hate but this was a fun movie that didnt force itself onto the original all the kids in the movie theatreloved it and thats pretty much what its all aboutinspiring the next generation
Jul 14 2016,negative,for someone like the director calling the haters misogynistic and sexist you have cast all the men in the movie as idiots or jerks  and the final kill is a groin shot
Jul 14 2016,positive,an extremely fun fresh new take on the popular 1984 film paul feigs daring reboot is full of terrific nods to the original but still has the ability to set itself apart and not use the first film as a crutch the four actresses are uniformly marvellous constantly spontaneous and completely entertaining and engaging while chris hemsworth is a surprising standout feig confidently navigates the special effects heavy scenes orchestrating some great sequences including one in particular where kate mckinnons character really kicks ass believe me youve never seen ghostbusting like this before
Jul 14 2016,positive,our family of all ages 8 loved it hilarious exciting tons of action lovable cast great summer movie
Jul 14 2016,positive,such a fun movie despite the bad reaction it got even before it was released not sure based on what this was a lot of fun and a very respectful reboot to the original franchise awesome
Jul 14 2016,positive,beat my expectations thats mostly because it was very unlike the original contrary to what the trailers lead you to think
Jul 14 2016,positive,its not what i typically choose to watch but this reboot certainly did put a smile on my face ghostbusters serves as an appropriate update to the 1984 classic without compromising its original charm and humour its definitely not the best film ive ever seen but its not the worst either its a solid film and i recommend it to anyone whos willing to give it a chance to prove the haters wrong about the female cast and dodgy looking trailer girlpower
Jul 14 2016,negative,trying too hard to be funny and coming up shorter than your pinky toe      the story starts off with a phenomenon that hits an old house that has become a tourist attraction once a ghost emerges from the basement of the house the man in charge seeks out help from erin gilbert kristen wiig who wrote a book on ghost she has not recognized her work in years and has tried to put that part of her life behind her she has now been forced to seek out her old friend abby yates melissa mccarthy that partnered with her on that book to investigate the paranormal case of the house along with jillian holztmann kate mckinnon who is a genius engineer that has been working with abby for quite some time they later acquire a location for their work and end up recruiting patty tolan leslie jones to start some real ghost hunting as they discover a much bigger phenomenon then they hoped forâ       abby yates melissa mccarthy was the ray stantz dan aykroyd kind of character except trying hard to be funny erin gilbert kristen wiig had to be the egon spengler harold ramis of the group but an extra quirky version    leslie jones patty tolan was obviously the ernie hudson winston zeddmore of the group but just plain extra    jillian holztmann kate mckinnon is definitely suppose to be the peter venkman bill murray of the group but a really bad caricature version of him its like she was a child on some bad flintstone vitamins or something the facial expressions and things she was doing were very weird and unsettling it looked like she wanted to laugh at herself the whole movie as a matter of fact everyone was a caricature of the original characters    chris hemsworths character was the dumbest character for no reason he was of course the jeanine melnitz annie potts version in this movie but stupid his whole introduction was just a waste of space in the movie the scene was such a pain to watch and was not funny at all its like they went out of their way ridiculously to make him and men in general look stupid i mean he was unnecessarily dee dumbest    moving on the graphics were cool and their gadgets were pretty tight the tightest scene in the whole movie is with kate mckinnon as she wields the new proton whips to attack the ghosts bill murray was in it but was not at all reprising or connected in anyway to the original i was really hoping there was some kind of connection to the original product but it was its own thing nothing wrong at all with being your own thing but with such a big demand for this to be at least a decent movie you would think they would use the momentum of the originals through something connectingâ  when i say demand im not talking about people actually wanting this remake but merely referring to the concept of if you are going to do it do it right annie potts sigourney weaver ernie hudson dan aykroyd mr stay puft and slimer also gave us cameos which was a pleasure to see    the plot of the movie wasnt a bad one but it could have been done much much better it was honestly a reiteration of the originals plot from the first movie i called the subvillain or rather who would be used as the subvillain before the movie even came out the sad thing is this movie had no theme song or montage music to even get you more into the story music plays a huge part in most of these classic movies the originals had music that got you somewhat pumped to see the ghostbusters do their thing the original had good music that fit the situation and feel like cleanin up the town by the bus boys savin the day by alessi magic by mickey smiley danas theme by elmer bernstein and of course the classic ghostbusters by ray parker jr lets not mention the second movie that had such greatness like bobby browns on our own if that song is played now you would most likely see someone stop just to jam for a bit to it these songs gave the movie more life and made it much more memorable it wasnt trying to be this comedy sensation and as a result it became known as a classic it was not just a comedy but just an all around good movie i frankly never saw it as strictly a comedy because of the nature of the film and how they presented it this remake played a version of the original theme song but only small portions of it at times    now the villain when i read that the villain was going to be the ghost from the emblem i thought that was probably the laziest thing they could do the way they defeat it was unquestionably another screw you shot to men just like the movie was doing the whole time i read one review that said this project was a man bashing project making all men useless and idiots there was absolutely no useful man in this movie and indeed was that    this film also felt like it was just a fun one shot project to play on tv or to be a straight to dvd special never to be added to i really hope they dont add to this but judging from the end credit scene it looks like they are trying to keep hope alive they should let hope die with this one what made the originals good was that the actors were all about subtlety no one was trying hard to be funny but was giving you comedy through simple timely delivery the original also gave you eerie and creepy without huge amounts of cgi that really take you out of the element instead of bringing you in take for instance the scene in the library from the original that ghost was creepy and eerie because of the simplicity of it it didnt need extra energy all around it no extra goo dripping from it no exaggerated look on the face to creep you out or any of that theâ subtlety helped fuel your imagination and helped you enjoy the atmosphere the movie was setting all the more    i hope they learn from this for the other spin offs they want to make
Jul 14 2016,positive,good film pales in to comparison to original but still managed to be fun and funny but biggest let down is tho cameos of original cast which felt shoe horned extremely telegraphed
Jul 14 2016,neutral,the ghosts are very well executed culminating in a fun final reel but unfortunately you have to sit through 90 minutes of flat comedy and dull exposition to get there despite being set in the modern day the fashion and music also gives it a vey dated 89s vibe perhaps they were attempting to appeal to the hipsters someone must have slipped a hallucinogenic substance in the water or piped through nitrous oxide at the press screenings even the cameos are squandered
Jul 14 2016,positive,good fun  only worked as a reboot because of an all female cast a good few laughs and the cameos from the original was a nice touch i hope it does well at the box office as id like to see a sequel i wasnt a fan of the new slimer though
Jul 14 2016,negative,quite possibly one of the worst movies ive ever seen    really really bad i didnt go into it with high expectations but thought id at least get a laugh i barely smirked during the whole thing chris hemsworth came close to making me laugh but even his funny moments fell flat directing felt like a straight to dvd movie characters had zero chemistry story was just lame    special effects were cartoonish felt like i was watching a scoobydoo movie almost    cameos were too frequent and ruined the pace of the movie    villain was just awful story was lame    cant believe this movie scored so high from the critics that is just insane batman vs superman didnt even come close to breaking 50 and it was actually entertaining it wasnt great but it was enjoyable but this over 70 are you kidding me this should have been like an hour long straighttodvd christmas special or something    the half star goes entirely to chris hemsworth who was midly interesting but unfortunately also fell flat in this god awful piece of crap
Jul 14 2016,positive,personally enjoyed film but it has a very particular taste if you hated this film before this isnt going to change your mind
Jul 14 2016,positive,this years ghostbusters is a tame version compared to the original  safe for families with young kids some scary ghosts notwithstanding  things i liked  leslie jones chris hemsworth and staypuft  things i didnt  not many laughoutloud funny moments  special effects just ok but not what i expected given the 30 years of time to improve on the original  overall enjoyable but could have been better
Jul 14 2016,negative,this movie sucks it takes a shit all over the original which was a classic the second was ok nothing great but still a good watch the remake is an atrocity feig as well as everyone in the cast should be drug out into the street and shot for making this abomination     on the plus side you can tell which critics were paid heftily by sony to give this movie a good rating seriously take a look at the reviews youll see so much bullshit its pathetic
Jul 14 2016,negative,full review here     a missed opportunity filled with excrement jokes forced cameos lack of chemistry and some genuinely decent ideas fall flat
Jul 14 2016,negative,so much man hate over this movie female or not the movie is not worthy of your dollars there are plenty of new scripts out there stop digging thru the past
Jul 14 2016,positive,the film at its core is a fun and enjoyable film however while most of the cast is spot on the characters abby  jillian spend most of the film engaged in jokes that had just had people shaking their heads while i think leslie jones was fantastic and id see the inevitable sequel just for her character the character played by chris hemsworth was funsilly but would have feminists up in arms if the roles were reversed so what gives    all in all a great film for parents to take their kids to enjoyable enough to watch but comes nowhere close to the originals and needs far more intelligent writingdelivery
Jul 14 2016,negative,honestly the worst movie ive seen all year i wish it was better as i loved the originals is a pity in all honesty
Jul 14 2016,positive,this is a really good reboot for the franchise all the leads do a great job in the laughs and really embrace the silliness of the whole thing     the trailers dont show off the film very well at all it embraces what has come before it while also being something new and enjoyable its not a perfect film and sometimes there are moments that dont get the payoff they deserve     this film has also managed to keep its roots firmly in the horror comedy genre this is not a film for little kids trust me saw at least two families leave about 30 mins in with some very scared little kids no genuine scares for adults but the playfully sinister nature of the original is there a fun film that im more than happy to see a sequel from
Jul 14 2016,positive,loved every second big fun with a great cast
Jul 14 2016,positive,an 80s icon reimagined quite creatively and hilariously i loved the female egon and ladies would appreciate the eyecandy receptionist all in all a fun reboot with cute cameos by the surviving cast
Jul 14 2016,negative,stop the female empowerment crap  it makes life sad
Jul 14 2016,negative,a few cheap jokes yet the whole thing just felt like it specifically made as feminist propaganda as opposed to an intellectual and captivating film that just happened to have a female cast very disappointing and cheaply put together doesnt help womens place in hollywood at all if this is the only thing directors see that they can do with a cast
Jul 14 2016,negative,this movie is nothing more then a huge bad manhatting unfunny knockoff bits of shit that i will never see its an big mess that sony had done and this a message for you feminfascists out there
Jul 14 2016,positive,everything was funny from 4 crazy women to the wanton soup to c hemsworth
Jul 14 2016,positive,feig yet again defies expectations and delivers one of the most entertaining films of the summer season
Jul 14 2016,positive,do not listen to the naysayers and detractors this is awesome a fabulous funny romp of a movie a refreshing take on the ghostbusters world treat this movie as an elseworld title rather than as a straight comparison and you will not be disappointed this is ghostbusters in a parallel universe and is way more fun than i thought it would be like most movies its not perfect but give it a chance with an open mind and you will not be disappointed great nods to the original films and cameos that are fun without ever feeling like they are squeezed in apart from sigourney and wait until the very end of the credits for one final nod
Jul 14 2016,negative,certified fresh on rotten tomatoes 75 out of 100 that is good for everyone playing at home 95127 reviews say this is a good movie oh boy well buckle up and get ready for this     three parapsychologists mellissa mccarthy kristen wigg and kate mckinnon begin a paranormal pest control business unaware that an evil threat threatens to destroy the city and the world yeah exactly the same as the original and yes it is a reboot not a sequel    i went into this wanting to enjoy it and not think of the original whilst watching it but it just constantly throws you reminders of the first one to the point where you cant help it     of all the movies to reboot why do we need a ghostbusters reboot answer we dont now before anyone says your sexist because you dont like that the ghostbusters are all woman now ha not true in fact kate mckinnon and leslie jones are the best thing in this movie wigg and mccarthy are basically copies of murray and akroyd but are fine and chris hemsworth well he is annie potts and rick moranis combined together as their idiotic assistant which is fine  this should have been the third ghostbusters movie and ill some it up with what was planned years ago when harold ramis was still alive the ghostbusters are getting on and decided to pass on the torch to a younger generation of new ghostbusters easy done everyone is happy the original cast get their cameos which they do in this excluding ramis and moranis and we move the story into the twenty first century     but no we get a direct copy of the original which includes the finale spoilers causing a total plutonic reversal closing the door way into another dimension i wont even go into how it uses a moment from casper meets wendy in the finale although i think in that the green screen was way better   it is an insult to the fans of the original movie that have waited years for another theatrical release the pacing is terrible some of the scenes and jokes go on way to long and the songsthe original theme is usedfor twenty seconds then we get three that is right three re done versions of the song anyone remember on facebook how i posted about the fall out boy version that is the best one serious    the cgi is great but just because you have it doesnt mean the movie will be better for it look at a nightmare on elm street and its remake for the comparison     but i will give at a chance if they do a sequel they need to focus on these girls and their characters more and do a different story to what we have seen before the new gear is pretty cool the car not so much but mckinnon and jones make it a bit easier to watch
Jul 14 2016,positive,i have always dismissed the idea of a remake or a reboot of a successful franchise seriously why fix something which is not broken sonys main mistake was a rather unfunny first trailer that suggested that paul feig and melissa mccarthys team up magic had finally spluttered out the second trailer was much better but once the naysayers had grabbed on to the first they were not letting go no sir but knowing director paul feig is the man behind the camera i decided to keep my mind open mainly if you all remember the trailer of spy 2015 kinda sucked too and we all know how that turned out growing up i did watch the original films  the animated series but being more of a superhero geek i would not call myself a huge fan of the ivan reitman film or the franchise in general walking into the special screening of this all female led cast film i kept a skeptical mind and now i can assure you this reboot is not the childhood crushing disaster that some feared after less than seller trailers but a colorful extremely fun very funny romp of a re take on a classic the good news for feig fans is that this film is almost as enjoyable as the original a definite reboot and not a sequel it nonetheless acknowledges the original with some nice touches and a few well placed cameos that serve to pass the baton one that spends just the right amount of time paying sometimes cheeky but always respectful homage to the original with fantastic cameos from all of the living original cast without being a slave to it it cheerfully moves with its own style and its own brand of humour which is consistently delightful thanks to the very genuine chemistry of the four leads each character is distinctive and quirky and the ghosts are purposefully stylized in a way that lends itself well to the bombastic tone of the movie there are gadgets and techie jargon to satisfy the nerdiest of fans and a surprising amount of scares everyone was well aware that they had some pretty huge shows to fill and obviously put a lot of work in with the end result a well acted well written and technically impressive whole it saddens me deeply that this film has been surrounded by such blind hate from people who refuse to let go of the original 1984 film and act like its mandatory to be offensive about this one the movie kept me entertained for the full duration there were even some moments that left me surprised by their brilliance and there is plenty of fan service to be enjoyed including some familiar faces thrown in to the mix as cameos but enough said about that the story follows erin kristen wiig a scientist who finds out that her paranormal investigation book written by her younger self and her childhood friend fellow scientist abby melissa mccarthy has been released onto the internet afraid that this fantastical book will ruin her reputation erin hunts down abby and her colleague jillian kate mckinnon who are paranormal scientists while investigating a haunting in order to secure funding the trio find out that someone is amplifying paranormal activity in new york in order to break the barrier between the living and the dead after some successful public attempts the trio form an independent organisation to catch and study ghosts when the trio look into a subway haunting they meet patty tolan leslie jones possibly the friendliest and most helpful mta employee ever whose vast knowledge of new york city history makes her a clear choice to round out the team joining them is also their all brawn no brain assistant kevin chris hemsworth the rest of the story doesnt slavishly remake ghostbusters so much as respectfully riff on it with nods to the original both big and small things start well enough characters are built plots are set in motion but the whole business of catching ghosts feels like it comes incredibly easy in fact once the team busts their first ghost it feels like maybe 30 minutes of the plot have been cut out and were right near the end of the movie thats how quickly things happen remember the montage in the first movie where we see the ghostbusters learning to do their job this movie doesnt have that type of scene what there is instead is a bunch of tech jargon and gadgetry all throughout the movie most of the gadgets are incredibly cool but the proton packs seem to have a bigger arc than many of the characters theres also plenty of quasiscientific gobbledygook to appease hardcore fans andor executive producer dan aykroyd and yet after all that the movie is simply fun youd think saying the movies story and main villain arent very good would really be damning but everything else feig and his cast are doing is electric and makes up for it the cataclysmic escalation of the third act must be seen to be believed set pieces before that are dripping with humour and beautiful effects and the 3d this is a movie you have to see in 3d as feig has the slime and proton charges exploding off the edges of the frame its a visceral delight is the humour as sophisticated as the originals probably not being honest but thats not to say it isnt funny the humour is just different drawn from modern pop culture and is slightly feminine in nature with a bit of the old kids will laugh but the adults will really get it thrown in i genuinely also found parts of this film scary there is a lot of camp and comedy but theres a couple of bits that are somewhat harrowing some of the ghosts are creepylooking and although we as an audience know theres no risk to any of the main characters its still a bit scary i like that the balance of horror and comedy is very palatable it doesnt stray into territory that is too dark or unforgiving but horror does help the narrative there are moments where the continuity seems a bit iffy and the ghosts arent uberrealistic looking theyre more resemblant of mid2000s scooby dooitis but thats okay lets be frank were not looking for a ghostbusters movie to be gritty its a comedy horror not any sort of paranormal activity nonsense of my few complaints one would be that the villain is noticeably underdeveloped in a way that is detrimental to the plot while this complaint could also be levied at the original too it feels more noticeable here this also creates pacing issues which are problem from act 2 onwards and the emotional climax of the movie as well as the weight the stakes hold for the ghostbusters personally suffer for it is this movie perfect no not at all the cameos were forced ozzy and there was some dialogue and scenes which werent great i didnt really like the shooting in the crotch or buddy saving scenes but i still think this film is solid and entertaining the four women share a palpable enjoyment of each others company and feig may love his cast and characters more than reitman who ceded much of the 1984 movie to bill murray as one does when bill murray is around the filmmakers obvious affection and the central quartets nearinstant rapport makes up for the abbyerin relationship not fully providing the kind of emotional grounding that dippold and feig obviously intend the performances were pretty solid from every department and the chemistry worked fairly well melissa mccarthy and kristen wiig might not have been standouts but they were certainly solid leads mccarthy toned down the mccarthy most people associate with her and we get a good team leader leslie jones character added good humour i could tell from the scene in her subway booth she was going to be good hemsworth in a relatively small and simple role is absolutely hilarious every time hes on screen its a performance that goes way beyond the bounds of anything hes done before but he makes what would normally be a pretty repetitive role playing the brain dead receptionist hugely funny adding an extra level of humour to the film beyond the four leading ladies but the person who was even funnier than hemsworth was kate mckinnon throughout the film im certain that she accounted for 90 of the biggest laugh she plays the bizarre but brilliant scientist to absolute perfection with an onpoint balance between purely bizarre humour and sidesplitting physical comedy making her the brightest spot at the centre of this hugely funny movie andy garcia is passable as the mayor the film triumphed over the prerelease criticisms that this was pandering to feminism the issue didnt cross my mind at all the characters and the actors were enjoyable there was a decent explanation to all the ghostbusters reasons for being part of the team youd have to enter the cinema wanting to be annoyed at this for it to actually be an issue on the whole ghostbusters may not be a perfect film but it sure is a fun energetic and visually awesome take on the franchise and id happily sit through it again a sequel though seemingly doubtful wouldnt be so bad in my books
Jul 14 2016,negative,i enjoyed the ow my balls reboot     wait this was a different reboot     oh
Jul 14 2016,positive,dont listen to the whiners who dismissed it sight unseen so much fun
Jul 14 2016,positive,great reboot loved the cast writing and directing the 3d is an absolute must
Jul 14 2016,negative,it starts really well then quickly the nostalgia charm and story fade away    the 4 leads work well and have several funny moment throughout its run time its just a shame that they were all in the trailer  chris hemsworths commitment as the dum blonde receptionist is admirable and at times a real delight they just push the jokes that one step too far on every occasion    a lovely score with hints of the predecessor history but ultimately forgettable    what really lets ghostbusters down is the editing and nonsensical story the film never outlines any clear ramifications or reasons for the main villains attempt to destroy new york   at several times you have the feeling that a good film is waiting to burst out from paul feig only for it to get the chop in the editing room  one very obvious moment is clearly started and then never truly realised only to be reduced to the credit reel which is a shame as it could have brought real joy and laughter to a film lacking in its final third  on the other hand the cameos are handled very well and never feel forced shame the film doesnt display this ability in any other way    over the top cartoon cgi and awful 3d effects also hinder this franchise reboot aimed at young adults  if you have to watch this film make sure its in 2d otherwise prepare to have you senses beaten into submission  its worth a watch one day just maybe not on the big screen
Jul 14 2016,positive,while this is nowhere near the excellence of the original film this still has some stunning visual effects a great sense of humor an entertaining story and a good cast
Jul 14 2016,negative,i was sickened to my corecomparable to sitting through a 2 hour trump rally
Jul 14 2016,positive,movie was the berst movie ive ever seen in my life the jokes are funny and good and i do not like the 1985 ghostbusters movie and that was not funny and plus sure be rented r because there was a sex seem and you saying males are better than females if you said this then youre dumb because you dont know history of ghostbusters and there was a female ghostbuster and now youre saying that their never been a female ghostbuster and so im giving my review for ghostbusters 2016 1010  and plus if youre thinking i got pay to this do this and going to say no i do not get pay to do this review
Jul 14 2016,positive,the performance of all the actors was phenomenal and the movie had great satire they could have improved on minor things such as the way the presented all the jokes and the dialogue itself
Jul 13 2016,negative,my eyes have never been more violated in a very long time
Jul 13 2016,negative,it was terrible i didnt laugh a single time because the humor was so dry the actors should have been better ladies than this
Jul 13 2016,negative,the screenplay is poor the direction is lackluster the performances of kristen wiig and melissa mccarthy ranges from bland to annoying a terrible movie not worth spending any money on
Jul 13 2016,negative,stop insulting the fans almost no one has a problem with the cast i is the horrible script and directing that are the reasons for the disdain for the movie  it is sexist to falsly accuse people of sexism
Jul 13 2016,negative,the good reviews for this movie are funnier than the actual movie  a terrible attempt at a reboot where the only idea behind it was lets make ghostbusters women because women its not fresh its not innovative and the black character is one hell of a racist stereotype  do not give money to this film or it might encourage them to make a sequel
Jul 13 2016,positive,growing up with the franchise in the 80s i can honestly say i enjoyed this movie it kept me entertained the whole time it was slap stick comedy at times and some of the jokes fell flat but the special effects were awesome especially the finale fight scene leslie jones and chris hemsworth were the stand outs for me they were both hilarious all the surviving cast did a cameo with the exception of rick moranis bill murray was awesome and i almost didnt recognize dan aykroyd there were lots of nods to the original the staypuftt marshmallow man makes an appearance overall a solid movie i think if you go into it with an open mind you will enjoy it
Jul 13 2016,negative,warned my parents not to see it and they ignored me      after they saw it they called and told me it was boring and not very funny    all of you rotten tomatoes critics have lost your reputation in having taste for films            certified fresh for a below average movie  the jokes are not even that funny and the story is horrible and predictable  n    no one is going to pay attention to you anymore
Jul 13 2016,positive,really enjoyed thisfunny as and nice to see some girl power
Jul 13 2016,negative,shit movie which i wont see not even worth renting or watching on tv when it gets its garbage ass on there
Jul 13 2016,negative,how is it empowering to women to be surrounded by morons ask yourself this question and you will find the real sorce of crap known as this movie helmsworth the only funny part of this flick is like that friend of a friend at a party who seems cool at first but then you wanna bash his skull when you realize hes a douche jokes were not funny wasnt enough seriousness in the film to balance the one note jokes strewen about
Jul 13 2016,negative,it wasnt funny the story was horrid and the acting even worse i need brain bleach to forget about this garbage
Jul 13 2016,negative,how is this getting a fresh rating payoffs maybe backing up a pc culture no matter what i dunno but this was terrible massively predictable storyline sour and forced jokes and zero real characteristics i honestly feel bad for the cameo actors just so bad
Jul 13 2016,positive,i have the opportunity to see the new ghostbusters last night i have to tell you i really enjoyed it i didnt know what to expect other then people bustin ghost    i think it was a nice homage to the original with a fresh take i laughed and all the right places and i jumped a few times  these movies are not being made for deep intellectual thinking just grab your popcorn go inside and have a good time aka fun popcorn movie
Jul 13 2016,positive,easily as funny as the original enjoyable  the actors deliver solid performances with leslie jones getting the most laughs from me the special effects are up to date  smooth  donâtmt deter from the rest of the film the overall story could have been flushed out more perhaps with the villain especially but itâtms definitely worth a watch and thereâtms a scene after the credits so make sure you stay to the end
Jul 13 2016,negative,cats and dogs living together   mass hysteria
Jul 13 2016,positive,awesome ghostbusters film 2016
Jul 13 2016,neutral,a few funny moments the action at the end was pretty badass
Jul 13 2016,positive,visual thrills a few twists and easter eggs and comedic chemistry amongst the cast is highly enjoyable though this ghostbusters is ultimately too similar to the original
Jul 13 2016,positive,this was better than part 2
Jul 13 2016,positive,hating this movie is such a dumb sexist cliche
Jul 13 2016,positive,if you watched the original as a kid and enjoyed the goofy humor this is a fun reboot no need to take it seriously and lots of laughs
Jul 13 2016,positive,the movie had featured a lot of backlash because of its female protagonist however they were some of the funniest comedies of recently and so the main cast was the main reason i wanted to watch this movie since i wasnt a fan of the original nor did i watch it before that being said the previous that came out werent that good the jokes werent very effective and so i was curious to see if the movie would actually be good and funny thus the cast was really good as expected however not all of the jokes really worked although there were some very good moments not everything worked as a whole the movie was good but it wasnt in the level of bridesmaids and spy those were far superior movies still it had some good visual effects and few jump scares and if a second movie is eventually made hopefully it could improve   july 29 2016
Jul 13 2016,negative,big budget ghostbusters spoof movie
Jul 13 2016,negative,if you super glued my testicles to a cannonball and fired me into the theater i still wouldnt watch this ridiculous crap
Jul 13 2016,positive,great cast very funny definitely go see it
Jul 13 2016,positive,i like how well it tells the story so you dont know what is going to happen next  each character gets some good oneliners but kate mccinnon and chris helmsworth steal the show
Jul 13 2016,positive,i really loved this movie i was 14 when the original came out and as an adult ive watched it over and over this one hit all the right nostalgic notes and then added its own twist i thought the cast had great chemistry and it made me so happy to see women busting ghosts  this version felt like it had more actions and maybe the stakes were a bit higher if what you want is a funny comedy with lots of action i highly recommend this for an afternoon of fun
Jul 13 2016,positive,nothing will ever beat what bill murray harold ramis dan aykroyd and ernie hudson did however this new cast does a decent job of pulling their own kate mckinnon being my favorite out of the 4 its a fun time at the movies and nothing more give it a chance before you give it hate please
Jul 13 2016,positive,great ride that had me laughing like crazy the effects were mind blowing  what a time to be alive i couldnt be more pleased by this film
Jul 13 2016,negative,acting storyline as well as special effects i use that term loosely are pretty much garbage it definitely holds to the typical rebootremake quality of this decadetotal crap     so tired of the overdone and over the top cgi effectsevery movie has to appear epicjust isnt necessary try writing a good story and maybe have it be original hollywood has no new ideas anymore
Jul 13 2016,positive,great movie lots of laughs being a ghostbusters fan i was cautiously optimistic i am glad i gave it a chance and would recommend and have recommended that people go and see this movie
Jul 13 2016,negative,this movie is a poor excuse to called it self a ghostbusters movie what a joke period
Jul 13 2016,positive,despite the rage from fans of the original ghostbusters franchise the film was a pretty fun ride tons of homages to the original film from shots to cameos to one liners paul feige pulled it off despite the many early criticism
Jul 13 2016,negative,same as the old movie
Jul 13 2016,negative,this movie has a bumbling dunce of a black character and a sexually harassed male character equality im glad we spent so much money on this steaming slimmer turd 
Jul 13 2016,positive,took a while to get therebut still enjoyable
Jul 13 2016,negative,avoid this boring unfunny movie tired lines like say hello to my little friend predictableslow boring and unoriginal this movie rates with kevin smiths tusk as one of the worst films ever total garbage is there a rating below zero everyone involved in this train wreck should be made to do community service for the next twenty years
Jul 13 2016,negative,not as bad as i thought it would be but still pretty terrible cameos were cringeworthy jokes were lacklustre with only chris hemsworths character arising a chuckle from me antagonist was shallow and uninteresting while the protagonists were hollow and stiff   this film suffered from a lack of self worth with the already appalling pacing being ground to a halt every 15mins to reference the original film  parts of this film were cringeworthy at best especially in regards to early interactions between the team and their male buff but dim secretary there was virtually no busting and the visual effects are scooby doo monsters island bad   i actually didnt pay to see this blatant cash grab by sony as i payed ticket price for another film so i wasnt unfairly inflating the movies gross profit and im glad i didnt if you want ghost busters watch the original or gb2 or play the ghost busters game from a few years back because even the game had better visuals acting and comedy and is true to its source material
Jul 13 2016,positive,really excited for the new ghostbusters movie
Jul 13 2016,negative,this movie is so bad i dont even have anything to add to it the humor or lack very of is very very dry and unoriginal the special effects are at least comparable to the original i dont think thats exactly a good thing either
Jul 13 2016,positive,nothing to original nor entertaining nor deserving the ghostbusters name herealthough the ladies surprisingly are kinda funny at times and the movie is surprisingly well cast
Jul 13 2016,positive,this is three and a half stars really its pretty very good to be honest its funny though a bit more zany improv feel and not as dry as the original its exciting the cast work really well together gillian holtzman in particular played by kate mckinnon is a great new character id watch a sequel id watch it again its just solid entertainment if i was nitpicking the cameos are a bit crap and they turn the action up a bit too high on the end fight but overall its definitely worth watching and it really is very funny
Jul 13 2016,negative,i love the original ghostbusters  mostly like ghostbusters 2 this film just doesnt compare favourably with either if youre going to do a reboot then do a reboot  this is just a bit confused as to what it wants to be there are too many cameos from the original cast which are largely awful  unfunny  it would have been better to have them playing their original characters if only for a short while to pass on the torch as a continuation from the other films there are some funny moments but these are too infrequent to be effective most of the cast are okay but the character of holtzman is a little annoying chris hemsworths character is just too stupid to be believable and becomes unfunny after a while not a fan of this reboot im afraid
Jul 13 2016,positive,this movie was amazing dont give a crap of what anybody says
Jul 13 2016,negative,this is what you call death at the box officethis is gonna bomb like the engola gay over japan
Jul 13 2016,positive,from the moment the first trailer was released for the new ghostbusters reboot the film was facing an uphill battle quickly becoming one of the most downvoted videos on youtube it was surprising how great the vitriol was from the internet claiming that the four female leads were an affront to everything that ghostbusters stood for    so when i finally got a chance to see the film i was curious to see if the movie was going to crash and burn like most of the internet was predicting or whether shock horror the internet was just overreacting to a piece of marketing    starting off pretty much like the original film ghostbusters introduces us to the titular crew before they start on their paranormal crusade following them on their journey as they slowly build up their supernatural knowhow and take it upon themselves to kick ghostly butt and just in time too as theres something strange afoot causing an increase in ghostly occurrences in new york city    so by and large the story doesnt bring anything new to the table there are more than a few nods to the 1984 film with cameos from the original stars and direct callbacks to the catchphrases we all know so well but the chemistry of the four leads playing off each other does help breathe some fresh air into the script    playing scientists erin gilbert and abby yates respectively kristen wiig and melissa mccarthy have a real life friendship that carries through into the film coupled with subway worker patty tolans leslie jones larger than life personality and kate mckinnons overthetop antics as engineer jillian holtzmann and you have a group of protagonists that are easy to hang around with and ultimately root for    but the real scenestealer of the movie has to be chris hemsworth as the dimwitted but ever so goodlooking kevin hemsworth really commits to kevins simplemindedness and whenever he was onscreen he had the audience just bursting into laughter    watching the formation of the ghostbusters and the steps they go through to eventually form the team we know and love was a fun experience the pacing was brisk and the story beats kept the momentum going the banter of the leads ensuring there wasnt really a dull moment sure there was a lot of hokey science terms being thrown about but i dont think anyone went to watch the film for its hard science the ghost effects themselves were well done with some of the apparitions truly being spooky and yet at the same time oddly mesmerising    things started to falter a bit in the films third act the movie had been building to the showdown with the films big bad but when the climactic battle did eventually arrive it felt oddly uneventful even though there were a few action setpieces they didnt really have the impact they needed and everything seemed to resolve itself rather quickly    in fact you could tell that some bits had been cut of the final scene in order to save time and you sort of get to see some of the scenes that were cut out in the end credits seeing those cut out clips made me wish that they had left the sequence in the main film but i understand why it was removed    i think its telling that the most memorable part of this movie for me was the ghostbusters theme song from the original film 32 years ago all in all the ghostbusters reboot is a fun watch but its not anything that is going to really stick around in the public consciousness it lays the foundation for a new franchise and i dare say that its going to make enough money at the box office to warrant a sequel    i give ghostbusters a 35 out of 5 and oh do stick around until the end of the credits
Jul 13 2016,negative,truly horrid the best example yet even surpassing resurgence of hollywood greed
Jul 13 2016,positive,it really surprised me
Jul 13 2016,positive,turns out girls can ghostbust and did it very well thank you very much  while i dont believe in ghosts  i do see dead people  i really need to stop taking methadone
Jul 13 2016,negative,its not about guys or girls its about horrible writing this cast had potential to kill it but it seemed as if they were prisoners of a bad script with horribly underwhelming comedic hooks it was not innovative or edgy in any way just lukewarm caged and vanilla they need to remake this remake and get some better writers on board feel bad for all these amazing women actresses being stripped of their opportunity to make a gender leveling statement
Jul 13 2016,negative,never should have been made
Jul 13 2016,positive,some of th enonghostbusting scenes could do with being snappier especially kevin scenes mr hemsworths agent demanding more screentime perhaps but the ghostbusting scenes alone more than make up for the occasional lack of pace lots of subtle humour for the adults erins slightly creepy infatuation with kevin and so forth in amongst the slapstick and great cast well worth the big screen money the 3d is fantastic and makes good use of the fx work great film very promising potential for any sequels
Jul 13 2016,negative,i walk out at 20 minutes ugh
Jul 13 2016,positive,i know its going to be good
Jul 13 2016,positive,this was alot more fun then watching four 50 year old men that wasnt even that funny to begin with and face it there would be less critic if it was not four women melissa mccarthy rocks
Jul 13 2016,positive,is it hilariousno is it action packed no is it a really good watchindeed
Jul 13 2016,positive,she who laughs last laughs best  i am so glad to report that this movie is proving all those throwing temper tantrums over girls in ghostbusters  are wrong  i caught this movie last night in a packed house from the start we were all caught up in a new ghostbusters story  it is funny it is scary but most importantly it is good solid performances by the main cast throughout the movie wonderful cameos by the original ghostbuster cast ernie hudson got a huge round of applause btw make this movie an enjoyable time for everyone  well except for the whiners who are probably crying themselves to sleep in their parents basement to quote one of the characters in the movie suck it losers girls rule cant wait for ghostbusters ii oh  stay for the cookies
Jul 13 2016,positive,love love love the reboot  pays great homage to the original and is as fresh as it gets for a modern audience  didnt take itself seriously at all  haters gonna hate  for those of you with kids my five year old daughter loves it
Jul 13 2016,negative,so a gorilla two dykes and melissa mccarthy walk into a bar
Jul 13 2016,positive,song was terrible should have kept the original
Jul 13 2016,positive,a reboot that stands by itself yet shows great love and respect for its source material made me nostalgic in a warm way bustin makes me feel good
Jul 13 2016,negative,dreadful from beginning to end
Jul 13 2016,positive,not bad quite funny and a blast from the past made it a film worth watching
Jul 13 2016,negative,if i could rate this travesty any lower i would
Jul 13 2016,positive,loved it very entertaining
Jul 13 2016,positive,wow people were really hard on this movie eh it was okay i would watch it again on tv the ending was an obvious setup for a sequel it would be silly at this point if they didnt follow through with it since the ending sort of promised one hopefully the next one is ten times funnier    update had to bump this up from 25 to 30 it has become one of my favorite films to click on if i see it on the tv guide extremely rewatchable
Jul 13 2016,positive,if you go into this film thinking ghostbusters 3 then youre not going to enjoy it  treat it as a totally new film and you shall get some satisfaction  i watched in 4dx and it was most definately watchable  not much of a storyline but some great effects  good characters and funny moments a few more jumpy moments would have been good overall i enjoyed the film a strong 3 stars
Jul 13 2016,positive,hilarious no reboot is quite as good as the original but its very entertaining none the less
Jul 13 2016,positive,not perfect but was actually much better than i was expecting and im proud that it has the name ghostbusters attached to it
Jul 13 2016,positive,it could have been worse  cameos were nice
Jul 13 2016,positive,very funny movie internet got it wrong see the movie assholes
Jul 13 2016,positive,absolutely phenomenal
Jul 13 2016,negative,garbage movie that only possitive aspect is the fact that the commercials telegraphed the quality that i expected
Jul 13 2016,positive,doesnt deserve the internet hate it got its a fun summer pop corn flick
Jul 13 2016,negative,a bland forgettable comedy thatss on par with a bad adam sandler film blatant product placements poop jokes and lots of predictable humor this film will be forgotten in a month its not even the good kind of bad avoid this film
Jul 13 2016,negative,terrible movie not only they ruined a classic but it was obvious that their only purpose of doing this movie was making an statement and not making a good movie
Jul 13 2016,negative,we have sacrificed an iconic brand upon the alter of mediocrity thats exactly what this new version does it shows that the powers that be know nothing of art and only what can be merchandised and repackaged until the original source material is so diluted that it has lost all joy and meaning this movie is an insult to not only the original but to its own comedic and talented cast evidence of this is when the extraordinarily gifted ms wiig is forced to rehash a line from another iconic movie in what has to be its trillionth use in an attempt to be funny it was painful for her and the audience the rest of the cast wander about in some mild attempt to recapture the spirit of the original but fail im not even sure what chris hemsworth was doing in this movie but thats okay because he doesnt seem to know either kate mckinnon as jillian is the bright shining spot in this movie and the reason it got one star from me
Jul 13 2016,positive,my suggestion to anyone who has never seen the original ghostbusters dont see it youll enjoy this one much more if you dont for those of us who were here 32 years ago you cant help but compare the new version with the classic original of course i like the original better theres only one bill murray theres only one ernie hudsontheres only one dan aykroyd  who by the way all appear in the 2016 version give the four leading ladies a chance i promise theyll win you over chris hemsworth is also good in a against type role the story is basically the same but the world of special effects has made vast improvements over the past three decades i say get a supersized bucket of popcorn a big dr pepper and sit back enjoy have a few laughs and tell your friends they too should see ghostbusters2016
Jul 13 2016,negative,nonspoiler review    first off id just like to get this right out the way i genuinely believe the majority of positive reviews are by paid shills or bots as almost all of them came the same day in a very narrow time period some before the movie was even released and yes i am being 100 serious in saying that when movies have to have huge profit margins this should be expected especially given the unprecedented negative reaction to the trailer i find it incredibly odd that professional reviewers have rated this movie an average of 6 stars when the average fan voting barely exceeds 2 only conclusion i can think of is the reviewers were either bribed or were too afraid of coming off as sexist    let me also say that i feel i am a rather open minded viewer with no real nostalgia to the original gb i have enjoyed female cast comedies before and bridesmaids is one of the dozen or so movies ive actually purchased in the past few years this is not bridesmaid however remember in middle school when everyone in the class had to do a presentation and the two weird girls who were overly sheltered and for some odd reason loved horses got grouped together and tried wayyyy to hard to make it funny this is that same feeling of cringe and secondhand embarrassment only for nearly two hours    im not even going to go into the blatant sexi err im sorry feminism countersexism or the incredibly awkward and played out racism where the one asian and one black character are literally walking caricatures and just stick to some of the laziest stereotypes i have ever seen but instead focus on the worst part of the movie it simply was not funny cheap and crude laughs are easy and annoying but they do occasionally at least make you smirk but i can say with absolute sincerity that this movie did not make me do anything but mildly smile once the cgi was terrible most of the actresses genuinely felt embarrassed to be there and the plot was beyond boring look we all knew what this was no one expected casanova or an oscar winner but if youre going to be crude at least own it    its not the worst movie ive ever seen but it was certainly one of the most boring and forgettable ones my only concern is when this movie flops horriblyand it will that people dont play the sexism card to excuse it and kill the possibility of the next bridesmaids this was just a bad movie and no actor no matter how funny they were could save it from its poor writing
Jul 13 2016,positive,funny and the characters were all great the ending  fell apart but overall i enjoyed the movie a ton
Jul 13 2016,negative,saw it last night at a special screening sony even set it up with imax 3d for the free screening the cameos were depressingly sad the story was nonexistent the movie had some real good funny moments followed by a ton of meh in the middle it was like a mediocre snl skit mckinnon was good but by the middle she acts like something off of a 10 year olds nickelodeon tv show and becomes annoying jones is good for a few lines at a time before you realize she cant act hemsworth is hemsworth and his cherecter is done so bad you cant figure out how he functions as a human being this version is a very empty shell of the original no depth in the story or characters and  the talent is nothing compared to the original at all and the movie is designed to set up this argument if you dont like this movie then you are a sexist sorry it fails all on its own without sexismand it even fails on its own not being compared to the original maybe they need to stop casting buddies together and write better the we hire everyone from snl stuff should stop
Jul 13 2016,negative,to save time and sanity i will keep this short  this movie is awful terrible humor shitty acting and the action is not believable there was a reason why in the original they dont do flips and thats because its not possible or smart to do such with a heavy pack of dangerous nuclear power  the reviews from the critics who think that this is better than the originals are on meth and should be forced to watch the original until they appreciate its genius
Jul 13 2016,negative,people in reality this movie is awful this movie deserves a zero stars
Jul 13 2016,positive,i saw it at a screening last night and i went in with lower expectations  the trailers didnt do it justice and i was a little sad the movie didnt continue with the original cast even if it was just to hand it off to a new generation  i generally dont like reboots like this  that being said within the first ten minutes it won me over  i was in a theater mixed between people who had never seen the original and fans who even came dressed in character   while we waited in line i heard several people express their doubts about this movie  everyone left happy  it is funny  it is reverent to the original  it has several moments where the crowd cheered  i dont know what else to say  give it a chance go in with an open mind and i think you wont leave disappointed  it is a worthy entry into the ghostbusters mythology  and stay after the credits for a stinger that got the biggest cheer from the crowd all night
Jul 13 2016,neutral,by relying too much on the nostalgia factor and playing too safe with the formula paul feigs allfemale ghostbusters reboot ends up more like a glossy but uninspired supernaturalcomedy blockbuster    read full review 
Jul 13 2016,negative,cant help but think they stirred up the controversy to mask a mediocre production the movie was not horrible but i feel as if ive fallen prey to a pretty cynical marketing strategy i feel fooled and cheated and i regret supporting this film   without the lingering guilt of being tricked this movie would have gotten 253 stars very middleoftheroad not even close to the spirit of the original cast did ok with what they were given tho hemsworth felt the most dynamic which was strange given the leads
Jul 13 2016,positive,funny but predictable at times still a really good movie loved all the nods to the original
Jul 13 2016,negative,there are so many problems with the movie i cant even decide where to begin to list them so i rather dont do it at all
Jul 13 2016,positive,the new ghostbusters is definitely more out there with its humour than the original and while the film itself was pretty unnecessary it is still an enjoyable watch
Jul 13 2016,negative,this is a total waste of time very flimsy storyline and a total joke
Jul 13 2016,positive,its a competent funny movie the characters are interesting and work well together kate is wonderful to watch plenty of laughs most of the ghost busting stuff is where i lost interest the third act is so forgetful and cliche
Jul 13 2016,positive,this was the perfect reboot  as a reboot or sequel was inevitably going to be made because there was potential for profit this was the perfect way to do it  it was a great homage and had respect for the originals and had plenty of originality and humour
Jul 13 2016,negative,this movie fails on so many levels and just feels forced it is a cash grab and a disgrace dont waste your money
Jul 13 2016,negative,ok firstly i just want to say that yes i am a massive fan of the original movies but this is in no way a fanboy over reaction as some critics have shoutedthis has nothing to do with the fact that 4 females play the lead and nor am i a troll this is my genuine review of my experience of ghostbusters 2016 there will be comparisons to gb84 but what do you expect when you remake a movie    the movie actually starts off ok within the first 10  15 minutes i thought that this could have promise but that sharp fizzled out i went into the cinema with low expectations after seeing the trailers however i was open minded and hopeful after reading an early review reviews at this stage are mostly favorable well i can tell you now in my eyes and most others they are wrong    despite a relatively strong cast on paper with the exception of melissa mccarthy who plays well melissa mccarthy in every movie the movie was poorly written no character development with a villain straight out of scooby doo beethoven the 8th home alone 57 yes that bad and cgi that rivals it kristen wiig who i have found funny in other movies just didnt seem convincing and her ogling over the dumb but hot secretary was funny at first but grew old kate mckinnon was ok but again probably just over done leslie jones served a purpose as the knowledge of the city and with the exception of a few bad lines wasnt too bad but id say the acting overall was below par and the comedy was well not that funny it seemed like a dress rehearsal there was no chemistry it was forcedand seemed as though they hopelessly fishing for laughs to distract from such a mediocre script    the beauty of 1984 gb is that the comedy was subtle sharp and relevant you believed in the characters and they clicked 2016 had no direction we had no straight character to bring them all together such as egon it was 4 people fighting for screen time to delivery terrible jokes que the dumb but hot secretary  chris hemsworth  who raised the odd smile but this was overdone too    the villain was ridiculous the kind of villain that belongs in the spy kids worldcompletely unconvincing we knew nothing about him other than he didnt like people and wanted to cleanse the earth     i was looking forward to the odd nod towards the original but that was overdone the cameos for me didnt really work and served no other purpose than to try and appease the fans it took away any originality that it could have had    when i first seen the cgi in the trailers i actually thought that looked like the best part but in truth again this is something that was overdone common pattern i get that feig doesnt have experience with cgi and was probably a little overzealous with it    the movie just didnt have the feel good factor of the originals part of the romance with the conclusions of these was the sense of coming together and almost wartime spirit which i think in this day  age would have been great they certainly missed a trick but instead we had chris hemsworth dance us out which my 4 year old enjoyed but in truth was just as cringeworthy as the rest of the movie     ive read up how people have said that it is sexist and possibly racist i didnt get that feel to be honest certainly no more than other movies i have seen yes it is probably directed more towards the female audience but that wasnt the issue here itll be easy for feig and co to hide behind the you want it to fail because its women tag the problem is that it is just a bad movie badly directed with a bad script kids may like it fans of the original will hate it and anyone who is a fan of cinema will most likely just be disappointed     i give it a 15
Jul 13 2016,positive,pros  action sequences were breathtaking  gave me images ive longed for that 80s tech and cartoons just couldnt achieve   sound track brought a tear to my eye in its tribute   team left me feeling love and appreciation for their family dynamic  just enough character development to make you like and want to know more about each character  walked in teamgilbert  walked out teampatty    laugh out loud hilarious at times   equipment and evolution of gear was remarkable if not rushed   kids and adults were screaming in terror at the first couple of haunts  it worked well at first  credit and post credit scenes gave one a great sense of closure and anticipation of things to come     cons  the sense of terror established early on seemed to apparate away by the end when the threat was no longer obscured and had become overt  fear turned to desperation   some cameos were contrived and a waste especially murrays   some continuity errors with gear and uniforms   some characters seemed to do things way out of character at times   the dancing and girls just want to have fun silliness didnt quite work for me but i bet the ladies loved it   no sense of how much time passed in this movie  hours or weeks could have passed between some cuts  the equipment seems to suggest the latter but it didnt really feel as such  it seems like too much was sacrificed for the extended edition  there are huge blanks that needed filling  this is probably why uniforms suddenly changed minutes after they were just dirty coveralls in seemingly the same scene   id like to have seen more evidence of collateral damage after busts   i missed the business aspect of this team  theyre more of a research group than a business but it did seem intentional to do so especially by the end thats a fresh approach that may really pan out if a sequel happens      summary  i walked out elated and wanting more  i walked out in love with this team and each character for what they represented  i am not one to repeat view much but this i saw twice and want to see again and again its my cup of tea
Jul 13 2016,negative,2 hrs of my life i will never get back
Jul 13 2016,negative,this movie is rotten all the critics are paid shills and the fact that this is a soul less cynical attempt at feminism is just disappointing do not watch this movie do not pay for the dvd do not pirate it it is that bad
Jul 13 2016,positive,alright it was alright not bad just alright i think i need to watch it again first though
Jul 13 2016,negative,movie sucks no plot really graphics not very good movie really never got to the point poor acting overall a person could fall asleep easy in this crap you call a movie
Jul 13 2016,positive,omg this film is amazing its so funny has some proper laugh out loud moments different enough from the original to be a stand alone movie but still paying homage to the original
Jul 13 2016,positive,ghostbusters 2016 after thoughts spoiler alert very very well done kept expectations at a medium  actually was feeling quite nervous for the cast of what they would bring to the slime game the entire cast brought the true meaning of beys song run the world girls melissa m abby kristen w erik kate m jillian  leslie j patty the devil is a liar were all instrumental in bringing the house down with their mix of perfected comedic timing  a smart storyline that kept me following from start to finish memorable performances chris h kevin made me  many others lol zach w tour guide was nice start  seeing charles d is welcomed truly loved all the cameos that true gb followers will appreciate refresh or watch originals highly recommended must see 80s peep  of 5 5 of 5
Jul 13 2016,negative,this is a master pieceof shit  the critics and reviewers who blew smoke up this movies ass need a swift kick in the land down under  this movie is a sexist racist unfunny not clever man hating joke and not a funny one and you should all be ashamed of yourself for creating this hateful hypocritical steaming pile of dog shit i dont hate women and im not an uber fan of ghostbusters but this film offends everyone my ears and eyes have never been raped so badly
Jul 13 2016,negative,this was not ghostbusters the humour was way off seemed like a tv parody of the original
Jul 13 2016,positive,big fan of ghost buster
Jul 13 2016,negative,a badly edited film with most of the characters feeling like nonentities mckinnon is the exception low brow humour mixed with lingering selfreferetial jokes and moments that make this whole thing view more as a spoof on the original than something to be taken seriously    full review 
Jul 13 2016,negative,this flatulent turd can barely stand on itself as expected itll surely stand the test of time though  forever remembered as one of the objectively worst movies ever made period
Jul 13 2016,negative,ghostbusters 2016 attempts to bring in a new generation of fans by pandering to the feminist market paul feigs disastrous reboot of a 1980s classic will have you beg for mercy as it quite literally is a torture to sit through     awful cast severely dated special effects and truly terrible script to boot ghostbusters 2016 is like a bastard child that shouldve been aborted
Jul 13 2016,positive,absolutely fantastic comedy laughed all the way through and had a few scares i saw it in the bfi imax every one was laughing and we all gave it a round of applause when it ended go and see this film
Jul 13 2016,negative,didnt expect much so i wasnt disappointed even 3d and cool special effects and cameos couldnt save it should have been rated r and funny
Jul 13 2016,positive,is it good nois it horrible or bad nonot eitherits and okay movie wich doesnt deserve the hate it getssome of the jokes were funnysome not that funnyactresses were finei felt chemistry between themthe special effects were nice too 610 overall
Jul 13 2016,negative,disappointing specifically given the hype around the all female cast it became obvious on viewing that product placement and virtue signalling were more important than actually making a decent film its sad especially as i find some of the cast wiig and mckinnon especially to be adept at their craft but this film is adage that the crafts person is only as good as their materials and  sony and feig gave them shit to work with ultimately the political message is secondary to the entertainment value a fact i feel was neglected on writing this drivel sincerely hope the talk about having women and minority characters producers and directors dies in the near future to be replaced by a determination to reward true raconteurs whose craft is the determination of their success not their race nor gender
Jul 13 2016,positive,this movie was fantastic people that are hating on it are sexist or they are going along with the internet this movie is actually fantastic
Jul 13 2016,positive,i really liked it  they did a great homage to the original movie without relying on it  to create their story  the special effects were great too  the chemistry between the actresses was tremendous and chris hemsworths comedic timing sold even the most ridiculous of his jokes  some of the scenes did take jokes a little too far but not so much so that it turned me off  i dont get the hate being spewed at the film and particularly the individuals involved
Jul 13 2016,negative,this movie was trash it is an insult to the fans like feig and mccarthy insulted the fans lame plot cgi mess all over green screen death copies multiple things from the original and portrays every single man as idiotic or evil avoid this abomination
Jul 13 2016,negative,mediocre at best this movie will receive praise for blessing movie goers with girl power yet underneath its shallow premise lies a lackluster movie with constant stereotypes and the usual mccarthy jokes more suited for tammy and not this beloved franchise
Jul 13 2016,negative,with a complete lack of chemistry between the actresses poor slapstick comedy lines and a borderline racist black stereotype this movie seemed like a trainwreck from the start the plot seems to lose a great and vital feature of the original ghostbusters film  the way the actors were never in on the joke it seems to me as if the characters are trying to appear funny instead of acting naturally and allowing the comedy to flow   overall im saddened by this movie due to waste of brilliant individual female talent to create a sloppy mess of a movie
Jul 13 2016,positive,i wanted  an edgy dark kind of scary  ghostbusters  but what we got was light and fluffy with lots of laughsover  all  its not a classic but good enough  4 out of 5
Jul 13 2016,positive,i dont care what they say lifelong fan and i loved it  my little girl 6 loves the first two and said it was better than both of them     i wont go that far but thoroughly thoroughly a worthy reboot 
Jul 13 2016,negative,73 fresh are you kidding me are the reviewers paid by sony this movie is awful the script writers were there any and everyone else involved should hang their heads in shame after producing this lazy cashin
Jul 13 2016,positive,saw this last night its funny and lighthearted and the kickass moments are pretty kickass
Jul 13 2016,positive,solidly entertaining wonderfully cast full of good cheer and genuinely funny in places  let down by a few flat purile bodily function gags and some uneven editing but i enjoyed it  a lot  oh and the game of spot the cameo is good fun too 
Jul 13 2016,positive,people have clearly rated this film before theyve even seen it  the original has a special place in our hearts theres never been a film like it as a kid they were awesome  from my childrens point of view the originals are great but the evil dog gargoyles look fake so they thought this was far better never seen my kids scared and in fits of laughter during one movie proton packs for christmas  for me the film was great funny all the way through the women ghostbusters were excellent  there were genuinely really cool moments during ghost battles too  its the best reboot since mad max  what let it down for me was the original cast being included as extras  that pissed me off leave them out of it or make a sequel there was no need for that  also slimer looked a bit shit great film for all the family go see it support it  i want more
Jul 13 2016,negative,ruined the ghostbusters series
Jul 13 2016,negative,an unsuccessful parody of a successful comedy  shameful moneygrab attempt  snlcast doesnt get it
Jul 13 2016,positive,exactly what you would expect from a ghostbusters film hilarious entertaining just all around fun movie 
Jul 13 2016,negative,worst cgi ever shit cast and shit acting
Jul 13 2016,positive,this is the best thing ive seen at the cinema since mad max fury road and its great to see an early uk release    this film somehow seems to be both fresh and innovative while also being reverential of and an homage to the original witty dialogue and perfect comedic timing mesh beautifully with just the right amount of slapstick and slime tank humour which will take anyone of the right age right back to their childhood cant wait for the sequel
Jul 13 2016,positive,the beginning was so much fun but the ending was kinda ridiculous
Jul 13 2016,positive,i was just looking for something to make me laugh and this movie did the trick maybe not a perfect movie but a ton of fun and a great homage to the original loved it
Jul 12 2016,negative,so glad this movie didnt make a profit now all you dumb feminist have to admit we were right online reviews dont mean anything if the movie failed to make money
Jul 12 2016,negative,quite the bad movie the characters are unlikable the jokes had the theatre quiet and the plot felt rushed and left me uninterested
Jul 12 2016,negative,i just called but the movie does not answer
Jul 12 2016,negative,more like scooby doo than ghostbusters
Jul 12 2016,positive,way better than gb 2 at least as good in different ways than the original could have used some sharper editing and is occasionally too metacute for its own good but great performances and pretty funny irony bill murray is the worst thing in it
Jul 12 2016,neutral,the special fx were amazing the movie itself was ok i felt their was too many cringe humor moments that broke it for me also too many sod breaking moments of dumb actions by the characters
Jul 12 2016,neutral,well there are many nay sayers concerning the release of this filmi had read the negative comments on imdb and after seeing the film and rereading the   comments many who rated this film never watched it granted considering   this is a summer popcorn movie it doesnt have a stellar plot the ghosts are   much less interesting than the previous films and the acting is just so so the film at times can be funny and then there are the times where it is  just plain   stupid  even insulting but it is what it is a summer popcorn type film that tags   on to the wings of the previous ghostbusters blockbuster box office success stories the film has its moments just not enough of them  i cant agree with   those one or even four out of ten star imdb critics and i dont want to give out   any spoilers including who you might see in the film  there are some noteable   cameos i am giving it 2 and a half and its better than two it certainly not better than average yes a very average film with the usual gags the writing is just   so so and there is nothing stellar about this movie however it is not what   some are calling the worst film ever i went to the previews so i did not have to   pay to see this it may be worth waiting for netflix lets put it this way if i had   a large family and had to shell out   i wouldnt  do it so if you have nothing   better to do and you have already seen the infiltrator which is a much better   film opening at the same time then go for it it will give you a few laughs
Jul 12 2016,negative,not the worst film ive ever seen but its a mess  a few funny bits but overall i was hoping for a much better and enjoyable film
Jul 12 2016,negative,as a huge fan of the original growing up i was always excited about the prospect of ghostbusters 3 that was eventually converted into a video game then i heard a new movie was coming out but that itd be a reboot and i was disappointed then the trailers were released and they were just horrible way over the top and nothing like the originals i just got back from the advanced screening the movie is slightly better than the trailers but not by much    we see the new ghostbusters in their various roles in academia before they have to survive on their own so they start investigating the paranormal and build a business out of that it starts off incredibly slow and has very infantile dick and fart jokes or vaj and fart jokes including a vaj  fart joke it just is finally all over the place sometimes it is simple humor other times it is a bad sandler movie and other times it just wants to be a normal movie it doesnt juggle these well at all hemsworth is the star thankfully the over the top chris farley stuff which just doesnt play well anymore isnt as prominent as the trailers make you believe the remaining humor outside of a few bits and hemsworth just fall completely flat the whole mayor storyline feels incredibly shoehorned in and doesnt jive with the film at all not to mention they humanized how the ghosts came to be     i will give them credit for a few things they did at least make the overall story interesting and gave more groundedness and believability to the gb tools instead of them just popping up in the originals it has moments when this could have been really good but it never really achieves that the actressesactors arent bad the writing is just a mess    shame i really wanted a new ghostbusters movie for people like me this is a pass or perhaps just go see it in the hopes the franchise doesnt die like this
Jul 12 2016,negative,proof that the entire entertainment world has completely lost their minds is by the score given to this movie which is the absolute worst movie every made
Jul 12 2016,negative,straight trash corny jokes fall flat worst choice of actors visual effects are kind of cool but are overshadowed by terrible actors and writing
Jul 12 2016,positive,notice how 34 of the bad ratings are from people who havent actually seen this movie dont let butthurt people deter you from going to see a genuinely funny movie no one would be trashing the fact that this was a unneeded reboot if it was an all male cast im a male i love the original movie the original snl alums and i loved this movie
Jul 12 2016,neutral,granted i went into this movie being a huge fan of the original and expecting to be disappointed  i sat through the first 40 minutes and wondered what people were laughing at  it wasnt funny  there was a good line here and there but on the whole it just does not compete with the original  the special effects are very good  all of the surviving original cast members made cameo appearances except rick moranis  my advise is wait for cable or video or if you really must see it go to a matinee with a discount
Jul 12 2016,positive,it was funny better than the second and dont not see the movie because of the trailer
Jul 12 2016,negative,no chance in hell il be watching this disaster
Jul 12 2016,negative,to sum this movie in one word that word would be grabage 
Jul 12 2016,positive,so funny action comedy a tad bit of spook what lore could you ask for this foursome is dare i say it even funnier than the original cast it was exciting to see the cameos of the original cast too this is going down as one of my favorites from 2016
Jul 12 2016,positive,dont go by the trailers or the bad publicity this was an entertainingly funny reboot well worth watching
Jul 12 2016,positive,i went i saw i laughed   a huge fan of the originals i set those to one side and walked in with an open mind i didnt like the trailers so i waited with baited breath andi liked it i liked it a lot infact  the comedy timing of these 4 amazing comedians is golden chris hemsworth is hilarious as kevin the useless secretary the story flows along nicely with enough laughs slime and ghosts to keep you thoroughly entertained throughout   i loved kate mckinnons character and leslie jones patty was a total joy to watch my favourite line was about the movie eat pray lovewhich im not a huge fan of but the comment had me laughing out loud   this movie is filmed with cameos galore and when the credits role you may be surprised to see that many from the original movies had involvement and slimera wonderful cameo   the only thing i didnt like was rowan his character was a little bit too angry with no real reason for my liking but apart from that i enjoyed every single second twice for that fact   go in with an open mind and you will see that this movie was only made with love and upmost respect for what came before it   a worthy reboot that i hope has many sequels
Jul 12 2016,negative,complete and total garbage
Jul 12 2016,positive,how does that saying go oh yeah haters gonna hate there isnt a bigger fan of the original than me the second movie wasnt that great at all in my opinion but it was ok this movie is freaking great and the sad part is that people arent giving this movie a chance to stand on its own theres a lot of heart that went to making this film and i appreciate the final product dont listen to bitter angry people who have already judged this film without even seeing it sad part is that when they come around 10 or so years from now they will see they missed out on a good film i hope they make more 
Jul 12 2016,negative,ok so tonight i saw ghostbusters answer the call  and for the bargain price of 250 yes at a cinema    so here is my review opinion but remember people opinions are like as everyone has one    so i went in with an open mind and even wore a 30th anniversary tshirt to get me in the zone and i tried hard to watch it as a stand alone movie and not compare it to the original    so things i liked    the cameos were for the most part quite good annie potts was great and i really liked how they tastefully paid tribute to harold ramis dan aykroyd though a little on the nose for my liking and i aint afraid of no ghost    holtzman kate mckinnon would of liked for her to have had a bigger role she was just on the right side of eccentric brilliant and quite funny kooky but not too goofy     slimer taking the car for a joyride    the car although not as sexy as the ecto 1 from the first movie still a good effort check out the lego set it will look great next to the original one remember that the car used in the first two films is incredibly rare now so this was a close enough substitute    so we move on to things i didnt like     too many things borrowed stolen from the first two films some will call these easter eggs or nods i call it lazy lots of dialogue ripped off and the mayors assistant must have been related to the assistant from the second film but somehow more annoying    the chemistry or lack there of between two childhood friends erin gilbert kristen wiig and abby yates melissa mccarthy their history and whole relationship just wasnt convincing wiig was wooden at best she seemed to force her lines out as if she didnt believe a word she was saying and mccarthy played her character way too goofy removing any sense that she could be a credible scientist    patty oh patty why oh why did they write you as a 70s stereotype why not take the time and effort to make you an equal to the rest of the team 3 scientists and patty is more than a little insulting    rowan well no substance at all little to no character development just some badly dressed emo without the skinny jeans and guy liner seriously what was the point   and what was the cartoon ghost that he turned into some vague attempt to reference the animated series     kevin chris hemsworth what a waste of screen time i mean cmon you have thor reduced to an imbecile yes others in the cinema laughed at his utter stupidity however i barely cracked a snigger it was a joke that wore thin very quickly    the cgi wouldnt have been out of place in a straight to tv scooby doo movie i have seen the behind the scenes docs and while i commend the film makers for trying to use practical effects to then cover them up with cgi defeats the purpose surely cmon guys you can do better than that look at what they did with the force awakens    some of the continuity annoyed me too the proton packs did the job well at the beginning but in the big battle go from containing the ghosts to killing them without explanation some of the new gadgets are cool holtzmans twin pistols for example but a handheld wood chipper style ghost vacuum thing maybe not    the fall out boy song im not afraid i really didnt care for based on the ray parker jr song but its like coke zero its like coke but you know something is missing    too much of the plot and gags were used in the trailers making it far too predictable but like others have said it felt like a lot was cut out    i honestly didnt have an issue with the ghostbusters team being women as i said before mckinnons performance stood out for me   what i didnt much like is the unnecessary vulgarity that was part of the script disguised as feminism probably why it got a pg13 in the us a male receptionist that was dumber than a bag of spanners every man is either a complete jerk or just an ass and how do they defeat the big bad shoot him in the balls    did it ruin the first film no  did it ruin my childhood memories no  will i be buying it on dvd  blu ray  digital download no    this movie did get laughs from the people sat around me but i really felt like it had been dumbed down  a problem that seems to be a theme coming from hollywood at the moment it was in no way the complete disaster that many fans have thought it would be but is it the revival to the franchise many wanted im sorry to say that i dont think so     many will enjoy it and it will bring many new fans to discover the original which we can all agree is a good thing but that is where i think it needs to stop producers have been rumoured to be saying that the franchise will now be never ending and the scene at the   end of the credits backs this up but i implore them please no more     so if its raining outside on a sunday afternoon and there is nothing else to watch on tv then yeah give it a watch rush out and buy it the moment it is realised properly not    35  10
Jul 12 2016,negative,the first joke was a queef joke and that was the funniest most memorable line in the movie screw this movie
Jul 12 2016,positive,best film of the year
Jul 12 2016,positive,if its looked at as a seperate entity from the originals  it really is a brilliant movie  had me smiling and laughing from start to end  so much better than i had expected alsochris hemsworth is excellent in it 
Jul 12 2016,neutral,it is an adequate movie  lots of fun  kate mckinnon is working hard to deliver a lot of silliness and chris hemsworth made me chuckle every time he spoke  but once the lackluster villain of the movie possesses hemsworths character the movie devolves into a thirty odd minute race to the big baddie fight scene and its all very lacking in spirit    but by all means if you have a little girl bring her to see this  it is family friendly and shell get a kick out of the girl power action
Jul 12 2016,negative,what an abysmal messthe writing was substandard the jokes fell flat every character was a one dimensional trope every man was depicted as either an asshole or an idiot there is no girl power in a world where men are retarded or asses  not to mention the girls themselves are portrayed as rather idiotic themselves    this was more or less a hatefilm against men a slap in the face to true ghostbusters fans and a waste of perfectly good money  i sincerely hope that hollywood learns from this fiasco and ups their gamebecause if this is what theyre serving up its hardly a wonder that the entertainment industry as far as television and movies is going is suffering  the internet can offer so much more and with passionate people who actually care about the content they produce  if three guys in their garage can produce more original content than hollywood can with millions of dollarsthen it might be time for that change
Jul 12 2016,negative,disappointing film filled with sexist stereotypes and sexist jokes definitely not in the spirit of normal ghostbusters and one i will not be recommending to others to see every time a film gets given free reign to use female characters they seem to go full sexism and the result is this film definitely not recommended
Jul 12 2016,positive,this is the citizen kane of movies
Jul 12 2016,positive,reading these reviews i can only   assume there are just a lot more misogynists out there who dont think women should be funny great movie
Jul 12 2016,negative,its a disgrace to the original franchise
Jul 12 2016,negative,judging by the movie it was a decent script these guys were afraid of the ensemble show promise but are badly let down by a weak and stuttering story which staggers along and a poor array of supporting characters
Jul 12 2016,negative,this movie doesnt even deserve one star nothing like the original the jokes are not even funny please dont go see this film
Jul 12 2016,positive,a fun movie that hits all of the right notes  the story is familiar which makes it easy to follow  this is definitely a ghostbusters movie    the film references the 1984 ghostbusters film often which holds it back from truly standing on its own  despite that this movie has a unique identity that makes it more than a mirror image of the original    this film seems larger than its predecessors both in scale and danger  this makes the movies threat seem more real and believable    the effects in ghostbusters are good  modern cgi coupled with practical effects adds a degree of realism that makes the cgi easier to accept                  dan aykroyd was spoton when he said that this film has more scares and laughs than the original  there are a handful of make you jump moments in this movie and despite the films serious story the jokes keep things moving and grounds this film in comedy    the trailers dont do this film justice  because they show bits of the film out of context the trailers dont make a lot of sense and they dont accurately convey how the film plays out    ghostbusters answer the call is a fun movie  it has everything that youd expect from a ghostbusters film and it does a good job of giving us a new team  a team that echoes but that is distinctly different from the original
Jul 12 2016,positive,loved it and laughed from start to finish
Jul 12 2016,negative,cucked like american politics
Jul 12 2016,positive,first 20 minutes had me really worried the next 90 were a great ride though
Jul 12 2016,positive,although not as good as the original the new ghostbusters is an enjoyale and fun movie that seems to be able to stand on its own it may not become as timeless as the 1984 film but its visually stunning and full of a good amount of humour dont believe the hate is all i say just go and see it for yourself and you may be surprised
Jul 12 2016,positive,this movie was really good i like the jokes and cg and i love the characters go see it
Jul 12 2016,negative,relies too much on its name and not enough on quality content  actresss are boring and lack any sort of chemistry  jokes they only joke was the film
Jul 12 2016,negative,more like a cheap spoof or a live action scooby doo movie awful
Jul 12 2016,neutral,kate mckinnon and chris hemsworth try to pull up this extremely average movie out of the crap pound that its advertisement had put it into unfortunately the direction turns so childish that you will wonder how you paid for this in the first place
Jul 12 2016,positive,great family movie kids really loved it and to be fair i came out fully enjoying the film     could it do more yes and thats for ghostbusters 4     cast was well out together and cameos well spaced
Jul 12 2016,positive,had fun it was cheesy like the previous two movies and the cartoon series as kid having seen both originals in the theaters it was nice to see the original character makes cameos knowing full well of their support to the making of this film it wasnt the greatest movie but neither were the originals it was fun and entertaining
Jul 12 2016,negative,it is a horrible movie men hater directorscreenwriter made a terrible mess out of this beloved franchise good actors who werent able to raise this script from the hell it was hopefully this is the last ghostbusters film we see from the director
Jul 12 2016,negative,what an awful movie where do i start    1 its not funny i thought this was meant to be a comedy i laughed onceand that was at how bad this movie is by the end i had face palmed myself several times it really is that bad  2 its sexist all the male actors in this movie are either plain stupid or bad guys  3its also racist the one black person in it is loud in your face and street wise   3 the story is like a scooby doo cartoon  4 its full of pointless cameos from the original actors  5 slimer has a girlfriendi mean what the hell  basically this movie is a dumb down mess from start to finish save your money and ignore all the positive reviews that are either by those with a warped feminist agenda or those who have been paid by the studio
Jul 12 2016,negative,as expected its very bad paul feig is a sore excuse of a man like in every of his movies men in this one are either stupid or cowards hey paul feig what about you try to make a movie that doesnt bash on men   now about the story well its basically ghostbuster 1 but ugly looking the special effects are horrible you can tell this movie was made to bank on the name
Jul 12 2016,neutral,not terrible but it does have a number of issues the thing that bothers me most here is that the movie feels inclined to make some really painful and unnecessary references to the 84 ghostbusters when it should just speak for itself
Jul 12 2016,positive,enjoyed this film a lot more than expected would certainly watch again
Jul 12 2016,negative,what a steaming pile of garbage
Jul 12 2016,positive,very talented cast and wonderful director  amazing and funny movie
Jul 12 2016,negative,mess of a movie only one real jump in it and not very funny it cant decide if its being its own thing or a homage and fails at both lacks the wit soul and cleverness of even the second movie and instead goes for low brow american teen movie comedy  rather than the dry wit that akroydramis and co gave the originals
Jul 12 2016,negative,it was absolutely horrible  i want my money back    it was not funny and i feel dumber having watched it
Jul 12 2016,positive,i know theres a lot a bru ha ha about this movie but damnit its fun quite a few laugh out loud moments and in general its a good time  i think its important to just think of it as a self contained movie and not compare it to the original
Jul 12 2016,negative,i really wanted to like this i truly did for many reasons the first of which is that this is a film with ghostbusters in the title and i thought id at least get a giggle out of it and another reason is that i dont want any power given to these over grown misogynist man babies that have created possibly the most ugly and disturbing internet backlash in a long time seriously read some of the comments or if you would like to continue having what little faith you have in humanity dont i was open minded about this reboot of one of the pinnacle maybe the pinnacle films of my childhood i mean look at the pedigree you got some of america and the worlds funniest ladies and youve also got paul feig whos comedy directing credentials were reaching almost john landis esc quality bridesmaids the heat spy but alas after a slightly promising start we get what i would hope to be but probably wont be the moment when all this 80s pop culture cannibalizing and endless rehashing finally hits that wall its not quite a nadir but its just so pointless so effectless that its existence is just a little baffling really the amazingly perfect balance between saturday night live esc irreverence and scary stuff that dips into outright horror movie level freakage the bit with the couch and the demon arms the library ghost the hellhounds this brilliantly pitched harmony of scary and funny is here replaced with relentlessly silly knockabout stupidity and sometimes almost toddler style vulgarity theres a fart joke  and add wackiness the dry natural comedy of the first mostly supplied by the deadpan genius of the great bill murray is long gone on its own terms its probably a decent enough supernatural blockbuster comedy but hey this is ghostbusters and frankly im not feeling too forgiving this actually plays more like the haunted mansion at times which should fill you with horror to hear i dont even know if its really awful or not it just has no showmanship no balls nothing new nothing at all to justify its existence except for thor himself chris hemsworth hes fucking hilarious thats the other problem the characters i like mellisa mccarthy but shes just doing a lesser version of her usual shtick ditto kristen wiig shes funny hell they all are but up to a point the improve here is the worst kind of random lets keep going till we eventually say something thats funny  comedy stuff and theres not a venkman among them its just tired lazy and sad
Jul 12 2016,positive,despite fall out boys atrocious im not afraid and a very weak villain this movie was funny throughout with good effects great performances and exciting action sequences this movie does not reflect its terrible trailer and is a blast from start to finish
Jul 12 2016,positive,after all the hype and internet drama about this movie i really just had to go see it and wow i wasnt disappointed far from taking anything away from the original ghostbusters movie this is a faithful and brilliant continuation of the series the four leads are fantastic the plot moves along apace and the gags  both smart ones and dumb ones  keep coming forget the internet whinings of a bunch of manbabies when would you ever pay any attention to them about anything else anyway go see this movie on its own merits filled with charm and humour and respectful to the original in too many ways to count just great
Jul 12 2016,negative,bad bad bad bad and way bad just a complete mess 
Jul 12 2016,positive,really good movie my kids also loved it which is the point of a family comedy    very funny movie and im loving all the haters on the internet who predicted it would be bad are all wrong  the posts im reading from them saying its a hollywood conspiracy that its getting good reviews are making me laugh my head off   shocker a comedy movie about ghosts thats actually really funny and has ghosts in it   go see it its great entertainment and helmsworth is hilarious in it   great effects great characters chemistry and much better than gb2
Jul 12 2016,negative,this is my first review im not a massive fan of first two parts so i  was not crazy about upcoming reboot it happens that i was on early  screening and i must say that as for a reboot this movie was so  sexiestso feminist with plenty cameos with slappy jokes i will  come with some small spoilers just to give some best example including  part of ending     spoiler    why does it happen to be that all guys in this movie are idiotsmayor  delivery guy hemsworth was funny but they make him play idiot the  only guy who was smart it was a villaineven in a final fight thy shot  that bad guy in his nutsits like this movie is promoting girl power  and feminism also cameosit is not just with actors but things from  previous movies for example words like i aint afraid of no ghosts  was said by dan aykroyd cameo    spoiler    instead of some cheap jokes this movie should have some adult sense of  humor more connection between girls because it was missing first two  parts i was watching 20years ago and i still remember them but this  movie will be forgettable     overall as for me movie is only worth to watch on tv screen with kids  on sunday morning after scooby doo
Jul 12 2016,negative,this movie hurt my eyes and ears  just loud and overly bright movie that was not humorous  my mom enjoyed it
Jul 12 2016,positive,its really fun to watch the cast together cant really say the laughs are very clever though or the story is interesting but the dynamics between all 4 works well and at the very least is a smart gender rolereversal film that thematically puts hollywood in their place on the tropes that are used on women in most mainstream comedies and action films
Jul 12 2016,negative,this is paul feigs failure he needs to own it
Jul 12 2016,positive,ghostbusters 2016 its a cartoon world more like the real ghostbusters cartoon the movie and nothing like the original it doesnt take itself seriously but my god it knows how to press the fun buttons patty and holtzman you girls fucking rule i willl happily see more tales in this universe haters can go suck it also post credits awesomeness
Jul 12 2016,negative,if you want to ruin a classic movie with social justice why not tell it from the perspective of the oppressed ghosts who are trapped in a basement in new york in some strange world egon cooked up
Jul 12 2016,negative,it seems like the producers and everyone involved were so caught up in making an all female ghostbusters movie they forgot to make a ghostbusters movie that just happened to have an all female cast    let me get this straight the female cast is not my problem when it comes to this flick there have been female ghostbusters almost 20 years before this movie came along and no one has complained about them now that we have this out of the way lets get to the actual content     ghostbusters 2016 isnt terrible but it still sucks what did i like about it kate mckinnons character was interesting and funny and chris hemsworth was downright hilarious i also guess that kristen wiig did a good job though i have already forgotten most of the things her character said and the villain was ok yeah thats pretty much it     melissa mccarthys character was downright annoying like most of the movie in itself and leslie joness was the loud and obnoxious token black woman joness character was one of the most disappointing features of the film and this has absolutely nothing to do with the actress but how her character was written almost every joke she makes is centred about race and being streetwise its hilarious that the original ghostbusters did a better job at writing a black character over 32 years ago that character was winston zeddemore and he was great in the films they never make him out to be a moron just some guy that needs a job if theres a steady paycheck in it ill believe anything he joins the crew and one of the beautiful things about ghostbusters especially in such a tumultuous time as in the us is its never even important that hes black hes just another member of the team and as a team they set a great example for teamwork in general heres a line of dialogue from winston in the original          winston zeddemore hey ray do you remember something in the bible about the last days when the dead would rise from the grave    dr ray stantz i remember revelations 712and i looked and he opened the sixth seal and behold there was a great earthquake and the sun became as black as sack cloth and the moon became as blood    winston zeddemore and the seas boiled and the skies fell    dr ray stantz judgement day    winston zeddemore judgement day    dr ray stantz every ancient religion has its own myth about the end of the world    winston zeddemore myth ray has it ever occurred to you that maybe the reason weve been so busy lately is cause the dead have been rising from the grave    dr ray stantz pause  how bout a little music    winston zeddemore yeah         can you see what was done here this scene hints winston while aloof and nonchalant is a lot smarter than he lets on winston brings up a deep thought thats been bothering him ray responds with a memorized verse from the bible and winston finishes it winston was thinking of that verse when he brought it up then he is a little frustrated that ray hasnt already come to the conclusion that is obvious to him while his exprofessor bosses are excited to be running around catching ghosts winston is thinking of the big picture here he is an averagejoe but a smart one    leslie joness character however is nothing but stereotypical comedy relief which couldve jumped straight out of an chappelles show scetch    what made the ghostbusters work was that the actors played it straight and this has been mentioned before werent in on the joke one of the major elements which make the 84 ghostbusters good is the casual  nothing to lose flippant attitude of the ghostbusters team combined with the smart humor  in ghostbusters 2016 everyone is in on the joke and its what takes away from the experience       so much for the characters lets finish this    ghostbusters 2016 is hypocritically sexist towards men despite the producers its director and parts of the cast having constantly called every voice of concern and everyone who wasnt being positive about this sexist manchildren it tries to promote women in leading roles in movies by completely shitting all over men every man featured in this movie is either creepy stupid an asshole or villainous and all of this comes to a climax of epic proportions during the finale when the ghostbusters shoot the villain in the dick with their proton beams yes that is how the villain is defeated he gets shot in the dick i am still talking about ghostbusters this is not an adam sandler or friedberg and seltzer flick     the effects oh my god the effects theyre somewhat okay throughout certain parts of the movie but the closer you get to the finale the worse it gets and at some points it turns into a horrible looking cgi  greenscreen mess due to a complete overload of crappy looking cgi on the screen the great practical effects of the originals which were combined with visual effects are nowhere to be found here i was already expecting this after the first trailer but it was still sad to see this sad expectation in its full length the cgi looks like it escaped from eddie murphys haunted mansion and the scoobydoo films too colourful too cartoony and at some point way too dominant on the screen     the humour is mostly lowbrow and not smart at all the dialogue is forgettable the whole movie feels mishandled from the very start and looks like nobody involved revered the 80s ghostbusters films at all i could not have cared less about the cameos most of them were completely unnecessary     i dont see this movie being big with the fans of the franchise i dont see any scenes sticking with people i dont see people still loving it 32 years after its release i dont see myself watching it ever again     the only reason this isnt a one star movie is because mckinnon and especially hemsworth made me laugh a few times
Jul 12 2016,neutral,pale knockoff or the original that tries to hard to lampshade its allfemale cast instead of just doing their own thing
Jul 12 2016,positive,ghostbuster 2016 both a remake and some what different that can stand on its own with comedy great performance by all the actresses
Jul 12 2016,negative,disgusting social justice liberal pandering bs
Jul 12 2016,positive,ultimate an ok film not worth the hate its getting online not the best thing ive ever seen battle in times square towards the end is visually impressive
Jul 12 2016,negative,terrible movie awful cgi and and its outdated jokes and stereotypes just arent funny
Jul 12 2016,negative,dogshit film feig did a shitty job directing this film we never needed this fucking film
Jul 12 2016,positive,great fun  much better than expected with mckinnon stealing the show
Jul 12 2016,negative,the funniest character in the movieis kevin
Jul 12 2016,positive,way better than any of you are expecting  it was never going to live up to the original but then again i dont think that was ever possible but it has a damn good go the trailers were terrible yes but the film was good
Jul 12 2016,positive,this is what you want to see when they remake a movie a new twist with classic elements and nods the cast mostly snl and ucb alums is great the vibe is fun the bright colors and effects are fun however the editing seems rushed im positive they butchered this movie out of fear of the shitty backlash then i feel like the humor wasnt as good as the original nothing made me laugh out loud though i had a few hearty chuckles for sure i dont know all in all i loved the changes they made and i enjoyed the film the controversy was unfounded and it was great to see an all female main cast was it better than the original nah but is the original a perfect film hell no its totally flawed and the remake fixed some of that
Jul 12 2016,negative,obvious paid critic reviews crap film
Jul 12 2016,negative,you would get better fun out of reading the back of cereal boxes
Jul 12 2016,negative,oh heeeeeeeellllllll nooooooooo mmmmmmmmmmhhhhhhhhhhhmmmmmmmmmmm c leslie jones this movie is horrible burn it and everyone who involved with it
Jul 12 2016,positive,neither as bad as predicted nor outstanding but good fun and funny nevertheless
Jul 12 2016,negative,terrible filmnot funny or entertaining
Jul 12 2016,positive,ghostbusters its not like the original but its a great movie yeah it aint better that the original and some of the ghost cgi is a bit bad true but who cares also some of the cast make cameos in this movie and slimer is in it with a female slimer yeah thats weird but its a good movie
Jul 12 2016,positive,it does a good job standing on its own as a movie i know how some people think its a recycle it had its own story with a villain that went a different way with his intelligence even showing charisma and the affinity for dancing but otherwise the only similarities between the 1985 film and this year was there was a huge somewhat adorable yet destructive gigantoghost   3 white nerds and an africanamerican wisecracking badass   slimer   slime   i cant think of anything else that is similar to the original so haters shut up take out the d from your fat a and stay seated under the basement doubters see the movie its worth your time even a day before you have to go to work its good enough to get a shoulderpat from the original film even dan akroyd himself
Jul 12 2016,negative,not sure why were remaking classics then femwashing them  or why we keep remaking any film over and over  are we really out of new ideas  its a shame because this cast could and may be very funny just turned off by hollywoods recent lack of creativity and new scripts
Jul 12 2016,negative,5 star very very bad
Jul 12 2016,positive,teens loved it laugh out loud
Jul 12 2016,positive,the film does well to stand on its on even with the ghostbusters name fun characters and some memorable moments this film is the perfect summer flick
Jul 12 2016,positive,melissa mccarthy is the funniest woman in comedy the movie was good
Jul 12 2016,negative,if you dont like this movie youre sexist and a virgin
Jul 12 2016,positive,really funny laughed a lot during it
Jul 12 2016,neutral,the 4 female leads do a great job and there are some laughes but they deserved a more cohesive scripteven movie
Jul 12 2016,negative,i saw an early preview    did    not     like
Jul 12 2016,positive,a really fun movie with amazing cameos and great weapons just shut off your brains and enjoy the ride
Jul 12 2016,positive,hilarious and well written  all around amazing
Jul 12 2016,negative,reboot with no real acting nor real storyits a fake boob job
Jul 12 2016,positive,trust in the talent involved and you will rarely be disappointed all of the women deliver and paul feig knows what he is doing this isnt some halfassed remake its a completely new story and its pretty great well done
Jul 12 2016,positive,this ghostbusters is as innovative and exciting as original though in new ways here we have four women being their own geeky crass unapologetic selves having fun together and kicking ass the ghostbusters are allowed to be flawed and in some cases downright immoral as were their hearsedriving forefathers    some of the humor is targeted toward women as in the original ghostbusters it was targeted toward men chris hemsworth is objectified in the same playful ways that women were in the original series and he revels in it his performance stood out to me as did kate mckinnons as the egon character shell be an inspiration to mad scientists for years to come    fans of the original series will enjoy seeing cameos from all the living members of the 1984 cast along with many winks and nods to the first movies as far as summer flicks go i give ghostbusters the nod over the comparable jurassic world     nothing delighted me more than the villain hes the same kind of bitter manchild who created five youtube accounts to downvote the ghostbuster preview trailers five different times at one point he wines to the team you have no idea what its like to be disrespected    actually we do the women say firing up the plasma cannons were shit on pretty much every day
Jul 12 2016,positive,went to watch this film last night thought it was brilliant and the 3d literally falls out of the screen
Jul 12 2016,positive,i went into this not expecting much and was totally thrown off my guard  the movie was actually quite enjoyable  the humor which in some very brief moments felt a little much was very balanced with the story and the creepiness of the ghosts   anyone who judges this movie based on what they think they know or what they saw just in trailers will really miss out on a good movie  it was a lot of fun the story was actually good and the little bit of fan service and self deprecating humor were well placed  it is definitely worth checking out
Jul 12 2016,negative,i liked the simple and honest original this is a franchise cashgrab and a decidedly unfunny one at that
Jul 12 2016,negative,i went and saw this as an early premier and i walked out halfway through this movie is insulting to your intelligence whether youre a man or woman the acting is bland at best and you can see that there really is no chemistry between the actors and the characters are given no real time to show any kind relationship building this remake tries to blind you with its winks to the originals that only remind you that youre watching a vastly inferior knock off    this movie was a complete waste of talent the actors paul is just a hack and time and money dont waste your money on this fever dream of a moron
Jul 12 2016,positive,enjoyable good enough i have an appetite for more
Jul 12 2016,negative,just saw the new ghostbusters and yes it was actually pretty good the overall story wasnt great and the cameos of the original cast didnt work at all in fact one made me cringe and it just reminded you that this sadly isnt ghostbusters 3 but i laughed in some places and the ghost action was exciting enough if not a little scooby dooish i missed the simplicity and charm of the original and for me theyll always be only one ghostbusters but overall it was good popcorn fun and the four lead actresses were all likable enough not as bad as its made out to be yet not as good as it thinks it is the children loved it and i guess thats all that matters surprise surprise a reboot that actually worked just aboutsort ofbetter than most anyway 
Jul 12 2016,negative,bad movie period run away as fast as you can near master of disguise levels of bad cgi nightmare that has advertisements in the dialog weak cameos and the movie is a man bashing mess
Jul 12 2016,negative,watched this recently and i have to say it was as bad as i was expecting it would be i went in hoping to be surprised and enjoy it but really the trailer is a good yard stick to rate the movie on flat unfunny poorly written jokes poor casting choices bad cgi and a not that great plot     the thing it had the worst going for it was the fact its a reboot and a reboot of a movie franchise as love cherished and adored by generations     its at best a parody of the original i felt at every poor punchline and poor attempt to recapture even the coolness left behind by the shadow of the original was a swift slap in the face to those who have such fondness for the originals     i genuinely hope they lost enough money on this flop that they dont try again    its not that its an all female lead reboot either if done properly it could have been great what was its undoing was the hubris of the director and writer of this film for letting it sink so low     i also feel women of color should be insulted by this trash also as they used typical stereotyping for the black lead all the white girls are well to do and smart with good educations and the black woman if as thick as a brick working for bottom dollar
Jul 12 2016,positive,entertaining and a step in the right direction for a remake series but there something missing a lot left to he desired given the obvious nod to potential sequels its possible this film is just holding back for what is to come entertaining and fun and funny nonetheless
Jul 12 2016,negative,this film is a boring chore to watch
Jul 12 2016,positive,fun phantoms and funny just what i expect from ghostbusters
Jul 12 2016,negative,rotten tomatoes had lost all credibility on this  the interwebs had told a far different tale and this movie is as horrid as the director that filmed it  and in every way as limp  sony your david manning version 2 ratings will do you no good
Jul 12 2016,positive,i am thankful in a way to the petty meninist ghostbro douchebags for giving me perspective and allowing me to realise that my own feelings about remakes  that the very notion of remaking a good movie is fundamentally wrong  were actually kind of excessive sure the cynic in me still rolls my eyes when the next one comes around because im aware enough to understand that most remakes are an attempt on the part of studios to make some easy cash by exploiting peoples nostalgia for properties they already own and because ive sat through my fair share of terrible terrible remakes but that doesnt mean that they have to be terrible or that the very fact that they are remakes is what makes them terrible if its a fun movie remake or not it can be enjoyable    anyway when i heard they were remaking ghostbusters one of my alltime favourite movies i was displeased even though they handed the job to paul feig of whom i am a big fan i thought how can they possibly improve on it and if they cant improve on it why bother remaking it when feig announced he was making it with an allfemale cast i figured it made sense hes paul feig its what he does i also thought it would provide an interesting point of difference they werent the same characters so it wasnt a strict remake at all but i still didnt like the idea of them doing it its ghostbusters leave it alone    it wasnt because it was destroying my childhood it wasnt even because i thought it was an insult so why was it    enter douchebags crying misandry and childhood rape libtard feminazi agenda pc insanity these apes had actual hate for this thing the sort of hate that starts wars about a silly fantasy film feig was womanwashing their favourite dude movie about dudes he was casting aside the dude ghostbusters with their dude parts and supplanting them with lady ghostbusters with  eww  lady parts and this was the worst thing in the history of remakes apparently in the history of cinema in the history of the world worse than casting marky mark in roles originated by michael caine charlton heston and cary grant worse than sticking a random threebreasted hooker in an otherwise mutantless joyless suspenseless and oddly phillip k dickless total recall their baffling level of vitriol made me realise that i had no valid reason for hating a ghostbusters remake whatever form it took i still have the original movie and the sequel on dvd to watch whenever i like i still have my memory of going to the movies with my dad when i was 6 to see it and being petrified by the library ghost and danas lovely singing voice the existence of a new ghostbusters movie in no way negates the original another sequel may have sullied it  though probably not  but this is a new origin story possibly the first film in a series    the douchebags made me change my tune and actually want this movie to be great just so those morons would shut the hell up    so is it great    eh its better than ghostbusters ii    i would like to state categorically that jones mccarthy mckinnon and wiig do not number among the problems the film has their characters are great and they inhabit them well there is clear chemistry between the actors and the dynamic between the characters is well crafted  you can see friendships being createdrestored being female their camaraderie is different than between the dudes but that is not a bad thing at all  again it sets the film apart the characters are all interesting as individuals too id had minimal exposure to the work of mckinnon and jones but now consider myself a fan of both mckinnons nutty holtzmann is probably the best thing in the movie and her assorted ghostbusting gadgets are great fun a nice original touch plus i loved seeing the evolution of the proton pack jones is a shouty powerhouse mccarthys a bit more restrained than in past feig roles but does fine wiig has dorkiness down to a t    but i do get the impression everyones holding back a bit seemingly in order to secure the allimportant kidfriendly rating its pretty much free of swear words and adult references apart from holtzmanns from the front line which if i ate popcorn might have made me choke on my popcorn then again the original had more swearwords and and adult references than this and was deemed kidfriendly a sign of the times dunno    kevin is my biggest problem with the movie i get that theyre subverting the hot ditzy secretary trope and i dont have a problem with them portraying a man as dumb but kevin is too dumb or dumb is unbelievable ways for instance its unlikely an adult without a severe developmental disorder would be unaware which organ is responsible for hearing or not understand the correlation between wearing spectacles and being able to see clearly i was reminded of dinner for schmucks which went to such ridiculous lengths to demonstrate what an idiot steve carells character was that it exceeded reasonable suspension of disbelief it seems as though when writing kevin the only thought was whats the absolute dumbest way a human might react to this situation ok now lets go five times dumber its just weak writing    one of the things i liked about the original ghostbusters  that i didnt even realise until i saw this one  was the scale through montages and big crowd shots we really got the impression that they were part of new york and that everyone was counting on them to save the day that sense of scale of stakes isnt really there in this one at least not to the same degree    so i didnt hate the new ghostbusters nor did i dislike it for obnoxious misogynist reasons but despite some awesome effects great performances and clearly the best intentions it did disappoint me somewhat 35 stars    update    the extended edition not only fills out the story and the climactic battle making the film clearer fuller and more satisfying but also swaps alternative takes into certain existing scenes sometimes but not always adding those welcome swear words or adult references making the movie funnier as well a reference to crossing the streams may annoy the ghostbros but i kinda like it overall while there are still mostly kevinrelated niggles this version deserves a solid 4 stars
Jul 12 2016,positive,forget about the old ghostbusters  this is in its own goodness so dont judge by the change u will love it
Jul 12 2016,positive,this movie is phenomenal and its now one of  my favorite movies ever i cant wait to see it again
Jul 12 2016,negative,if you dont like this youre sexist  that was the marketing for this movie the song is more personal taste but this pop remix crap is too common and it will be forgotten within days unlike the original which people would join in on even in public  but lets get to the actual review    serious problems with pacing scenes cut after the negative reaction to the trailers flat characters that are little more then their race and gender a scene specially shoehorned in to insult internet commentators the marshmallow man being a complete insult the constant stops for another reference or cameo towards the original the cgi was sickeningly bad jokes that fall flat on their face using the same old tropes   when i saw the cast i got excited but this it absolute garbage the reaction from the cast towards criticism is only more shameful    what made the original great was that it was taken as a serious movie this entire movie was a joke trying to ride on the original playing the woman card constantly i regret seeing this more then gods of egypt and i suggest you dont waste your time watching this
Jul 12 2016,negative,save your money and avoid this disappointment went in with a couple of friends on a double date to see this excepts a few laughs this is overall terrible movie not worth it
Jul 12 2016,negative,not sure how people can find this funny i found it so cringeworthy i had to leave before it ended
Jul 12 2016,positive,not totally without merit but it feels like a sub standard remake rather than a bold fresh reboot
Jul 12 2016,negative,its just bad    what upsets me more than anything about this movie is that while watching it just for the first time i was surprised to notice several continuity errors in the edition it felt like the rushed work of a film student    but thats just one thing among many others that are simply wrong with this product where do i start well the toilet humor and slapstick comedy dont help    i couldnt find any creativity at all lots of things have been taken directly from the previous ghostbusters movies but made in a sloppy and disappointing way the ghost designs are poor and unoriginal they are obscene copies of the ghosts from the original movies i havent seen not even one interesting monster or ghost in the entire movie    it doesnt feel like a ghostbusters movie it feels like a parody sketch of a ghostbusters movie in a tv show especially because its just a sequence of clichés one after another without coherence or purpose just for putting an example at some point of the movie theres a matrix scene just out of nothing it doesnt go with the tone of the ghostbusters franchise we also have a the mask scene with the police dancing these are not only things weve already seen in cinema theyre things weve seen in cinema more than 10 years ago    i cant understand how a work of such poor quality can cost millions of dollars i wish i could say these people dont know how to make a ghostbusters movie but instead my thought is these people dont know how to make a movie    im giving only 1 star and the whole star is for kate mckinnon the only genuinely funny moments belong to her it requires real talent to shine even in a really bad movie
Jul 12 2016,positive,a fantastic reboot of the franchise that everyone should get behind references galore fantastic new gear extremely funny catering to both young and old
Jul 12 2016,positive,i was glad to see that this was made as a total reboot without any of the original characters apart from the stay puft marshmellow man and slimer otherwise it may not have worked the four ghostbusters are perfectly cast and wear the overalls well watching them with their proton packs zapping ghosts looked as iconic as the original the special effects are in abundance and updated with some great cgi work     the story was a basic origin story building up with a few sightings and then wallop new york city becomes overrun with cgi ghosts so who ygonna call big showdown and the start of a franchise hopefully the next movie will have more depth in terms of story all in all though a success
Jul 12 2016,negative,while its not as bad as i had been expecting ott cgi and forced low brow comedy ruin this movie
Jul 12 2016,positive,if you must see this film kate mckinnons character should make watching the film worth it i didnt mind that the ghostbusters were female but the film seemed like it couldnt get a flow going to it
Jul 12 2016,positive,refreshing clever the change of gender roles is not in your face the crossover island story line does not centre around the sex of the cast  clever and funny in a brilliant way    lots of nostalgic moments and the way i see it  if the older cast didnt give their blessing why would they do what they did
Jul 12 2016,positive,such a hilarious movie go see it
Jul 12 2016,negative,the opening is good  sets the tone nicely but its as if a completely different director made the rest of the movie it loses all scariness  goes for the fart  slapstick jokes that you see in the trailers     the 4 female leads were fine especially mccarthy  mckinnon yet she was a bit too random  overthetop but they never really felt like a team  more like they were just waiting their turn for the next joke delivery the whole film felt very cartoonish  unrealistic    apart from the scene showing the destructive power of the proton packs in all later scenes the proton streams had no weight  they had no trouble aiming those wandering streams over other ghostbusters heads  no fear of their consequences    editing was weird  characters all of a sudden having snacks in their hands or being on a phone call slamming the same ghost around 3 times from different angles   proton packs kill ghosts now the rumoured song  dance routine that was in the leaked script  emails has been edited out but it leaves a weird setup that goes nowhere just a lot of police  military personnel standing pointing     the development of their ghostbusting technology was bizarre  unrealistic  they seemed to invent  develop a whole range of unrelated equipment gloves to punch ghosts a wood chipper ghostkiller machine over the space of a couple of days     the script had glimmers of potential in places but was mostly bad most of the jokes fell flat  the 9 people in the theatre with me barely chuckled throughout the entire movie the ending was terrible and very anticlimactic    while nice to see ghostbusters back on the big screen this movie was a very scoobydoo cartoony movie that really wasnt that funny not a terrible movie but nowhere near as good as it could have been its the type of movie  that is on tv on a saturday morning during school holidays
Jul 11 2016,negative,wow this was an odd one pretty much all the plot leaks have been true and you can tell this movie has been edited to remove things like a massive dance number that would upset fans it is still in the credits i went in to this one with a very open mind however very early on in my i realised that they were just chucking out jokes and hoping they would land   the movie follows most of the original plot points from the first movie with a few tweaks here and there form a shooting perspective it looks like it has been shot from a comedy perspective rather then in a horror styling which was the style of the original    lets not keep comparing it to the original does it stand up as its own thing well no because it references the original more then i just have and man do i hope you like the ghostbusters theme because they are going to keep playing that tune over and over again     there has been a lot of people who have been looking at the gender issue and honestly i really didnt care at all until seeing the movie heck the extreme ghostbusters had a lady and a guy in a wheelchair so equality is nothing new to the ghostbusters however i just want to know if a studio made a movie where a guy was looking for any possible excuse to fondle his female secretary and she was so unintelligent that she may have a possible learning difficulty would this be offensive well this happens a lot just with the gender roles reversed and it is very very awkward     chris hemsworth is the highlight of the movie playing the aforementioned secretary named kevin  and has displayed a sense of comedy timing and humor we have not seen from him before     the other ghostbusters are ok but really dont bring a lot to the roles apart from stereotypes really and to be honest we really struggled to name them with the exception on patty after coming out of the cinema     the main villain is also in it for a bit and then is removed to posses another cast membermembers and i am assuming that is because he is quite forgettable    i think there is a market for this movie unfortunately that market isnt me or a lot of ghostbusters fans also some of the jokes are very dated ozzy shouting sharon is this the early 2000s
Jul 11 2016,positive,chris hemsworth playing against type was a pleasant entertaining surprise
Jul 11 2016,negative,i want my money back
Jul 11 2016,negative,even if there was no classic ghostbusters this would be a bad movie with a cool idea hemsworth steels the movie a not very funny poorly executed meh fest
Jul 11 2016,negative,what a disappointment all the best bits were in the trailers it just wasnt funny
Jul 11 2016,negative,seriously im appaulled at anyone giving this a good review really  if i had a labotomy and were a girl 1416 years old id understand  this movies had poor low brow obvious jokes i was waiting for a drum roll and symbol crash on these forced jokes throughout the movie the tried to make references to the original throughout the movie we get we get it for the love of god we get it   every man was evil a coward or  as stupid as a brick  all women were the smart and brave people in the movie  spoiler  they shoot the bad guy in the end in the crotch kate has a device called the nut cracker  no joke   but lets ignore all of that the editing in the movie was atrocious it cut scenes that seem unfinished then started in others where you are wondering what happened they go from  a proton pack that you can wheel around to proton packs whips guns  oh and even though they created a tank to capture ghosts they now just kill ghosts no explanation nothing      what they could have done get guillermo del toro to direct it had thee old ghostbusters be reluctant retirees have the new group interview the old and get some interesting and unfinished facts about 1984 have bill murry go down into a library basement with them and see a ghost with its back turned have bill murray freak out and the ghost turn around and say shhhh but have it be egon  bill reacts to the ghost screaming thats not funny the ghost disappears and drops the book to a page  the book  tobins spirit guide     now that could have been an intro to a fantastic and great movie paying homage to the old still provide real scares and have sooo much better writing  but no this had to be a leftist bridesmaids with proton pack movie by feig  ughhh
Jul 11 2016,negative,rotten tomatoes critics are liars false  gave this a 73  but gave tarzan xmen and warcraft below 50    rotten tomatoe critics treat us like we are idiots    i think we can all stop paying attention to these critics on every movie they critique there are better ones in other places online  they lost reputation and respect  it is over for them
Jul 11 2016,negative,went to small premier very disappointed i had hopes for this film but  the comedy was weak at best and even tho this film was controversial because of the female cast the funniest character was by far chris hemsworth
Jul 11 2016,neutral,its average not great not terrible just average its really a popcorn movie if you ask me the hate that this movie gets is understandable but it is really unnecessary as the people say their childhood is ruined when in reality the original ghostbusters are still there and great as usual
Jul 11 2016,negative,this movie was sooooo awful take away all the hate for women and everything and its still a terrible movie story is rushed and its not that funny
Jul 11 2016,negative,so terrible it gave me cancer
Jul 11 2016,negative,wtf were they thinking
Jul 11 2016,positive,a brilliant and sympathetic reboot got the balance just right the girls were great
Jul 11 2016,negative,terrible movie my god its terrible just as expected
Jul 11 2016,positive,looking forward to seeing it soon
Jul 11 2016,positive,currently rated at 77 take that doubters  whoyagonnacall
Jul 11 2016,neutral,ghostbusters      who ya gonna call hmmm you will have to make up your mind     
Jul 11 2016,negative,all the places to shoot  rowan why the hell did it have to be the crotch was it supposed to be funny
Jul 11 2016,negative,this movie was a blatant cash grab and should never have been made horrible in every way
Jul 11 2016,positive,just saw a preview screening it was actually pretty good and sweet i say give it a chance i enjoyed it and would see it again kate is definitely the best ghostbuster and stay til after the credits
Jul 11 2016,neutral,had much excitement to watch this given all the funny ladies i love in it but perhaps too much of a good thing isnt a good thing the cheesy humour matched the original but the plot shouldnt have followed so closely the ghosts werent as iconic or scary the cameos of all the original cast didnt much help they just made me miss the original
Jul 11 2016,positive,best thing about going into a film with low expectations is that if it even marginally delights it is deemed a success this was a fun  cute rebranding of the original with some great cameos by the original cast but these women make it their own and succeed with what will be a successful summer hit
Jul 11 2016,negative,this is an abomination that plays on your nostalgia just to get money out of your pockets if you give these idiots your money the back to the future remake will be your fault
Jul 11 2016,negative,i just have to say it is not about an all female cast it is about this cast you guys just dont look funny now if it were a class act cast say tina fey aubrey plaza ellie kemper niecy nash now that is a cast you and the rest of this bunch meh
Jul 11 2016,positive,this movie was all i hoped it would be it was hilarious had its own thing happening while still being ghostbusters it was funny throughout i loved it the whole cast was hilarious and i just had a blast watching this movie i hope theres more in the future because i want a ghostbusters my son can grow up with and i can take him to see the movies when he is older and have more fun solid movie will definitely be buying it on bluray
Jul 11 2016,negative,oh my g not worth you time or your money i could not imagine who would like this movie  i honestly feel bad for every single actor that is in this movie
Jul 11 2016,positive,when i saw the first trailer i was pretty excited for this movie i was looking forward to it but at the same time i was a tiny bit skeptical i liked the movie it wasnt nearly as good as the original obviously but way better than the second one some parts were unfunny and some parts were childish and ridiculous especially that shitty fart joke no pun intended some of the second and third act was a bit slow but the final fight scene was a very entertaining sucks that theres no sequel i think that a sequel was confirmed not to come out paul feig couldve learned from the mistakes he made from this one
Jul 11 2016,positive,i am an original ghostbusters fan had a ton of the toys when i was little and everything all of the haters that are tearing this film to shreds are just being dicks  the film was funny had a fun story and the fx were top drawer i took my 5 year old son to see it and seeing the look on his face while he watched it reminded me of why i loved the original ghostbusters in the first place just go enjoy it and dont be a dick i hope they make a sequel
Jul 11 2016,negative,honestly i wasnt expecting much going into this movie but man was i blown away by how bad it was the entire movie was basically just one big take a shit on menfest every male character was an unlikable asshole and the female leads were flat and unfunny rather than railing on government regulation while delivering hours of laughs like the original this reboot seems to be some terrible feminist circlejerk with little substance beyond lol men vagina power
Jul 11 2016,positive,this film was genuinely funny the effects were great  the proton pack combat and new weapons in the film were amazing and a nod to the outstanding 2009 ghostbusters video game that served as the third and final installment of the original series and what the creators originally intended proton pack combat to look like if they had the money to do it originally these old fanboys wouldnt know anything about that though because they are not real ghostbusters fans  this movie is a great starting point for a new trilogy and the fact that they are women does not take away or add  they are comedians and the individual characters were amazing and powerful in their performances  i definitely recommend for old and new alike unless you are a cave man in which case back into your hole
Jul 11 2016,negative,ghostbusters 2016    its a movie that spends more time referring to the original than standing on its own how was sony supposed to identify this movie as its own when its constantly referring to the original and the original cast comes back as random character    every single joke is forced its like they have to end every line with a joke and it made me angry im not kidding when i say they do that throughout the entire movie    i liked seeing slimer but that was just another quick reference to the original    the cgi is toopretty by that i mean all of the ghosts look very bright and colorful though they dont look real at all theyre not remotely scary theres a lot of detail but the bright colors didnt help and there was an overuse of cg    the new ghostbusters team did okay with what they were given and what they were given was crap leslie jones character was one note and stereotypical why couldnt she be as smart as the others     this movie is so sexist its not even funny it depicts most men as either jerks or idiots chris hemsworths character was unrealistically stupid some of that made me chuckle i couldnt believe some of that was in the script     and the villains motivation was that he got bullied and he just explains that in a sentence    conclusion    i cant recommend this movie it tries to teach the younger generation false information about our culture   sexism and stereotypes its the same movie as the original and it doesnt add anything even to those that actually laughed because a lot did at my screening i doubt theyll remember this movie in a year
Jul 11 2016,negative,its rated 38 on imdb for a fucking reason the jews own this site and it is terrible very sad
Jul 11 2016,negative,absolutely horrendous   the actors have no chemistry with each other  the actors themselves did an awful job  and the stereotypical loud black girl really  the effects were absolutely horrible  laughable really   and they contradicted their own facts in the movie  the rays couldnt kill the ghost but only subdue them until they could store them away but in the big fighting scene they were killing ghosts left and right  every man in this movie was an idiot this film was clearly sexist towards men  with the fight boss fight they killed him by shrinking his manhood really    this film was awful it doesnt even deserve half a star  if you didnt laugh at the trailer dont go and see it  because those are literally the bestfunniest parts throughout the entire movie and those were even awful
Jul 11 2016,negative,not too funny some of the scenes that tried to be funny where not
Jul 11 2016,negative,horrible story horrible plot  terrible infantile humor  makes every man look either evil a jerk or weak or even stupid  the 4 ladies would make great ghostbusters but this is not the movie that should have been
Jul 11 2016,negative,the very first time i fell asleep in the theater not funny not scary just boring
Jul 11 2016,positive,very funny and entertaining  doesnt hold a candle to the original but i thought it was way better than ghostbusters 2
Jul 11 2016,positive,it does start out a bit slow but picks up as the movie goes along great cameos from the cast of the original the ghosts look much better in the movie then in the trailers which do not do the movie justice had lots of laughs this was an entertaining movie
Jul 11 2016,negative,this is the worst movie i have ever seen do not waste your time or money to watch this it is absolute garbage
Jul 11 2016,negative,in an ironic twist of fate this movie is one of the most sexist and misogynistic movies i have ever seen the characters are constantly insulting men and all of the men in this movie are portrayed as morons one of the jokes literally has the ghostbusters logo being shot in the dick it perfectly sums up this train wreck of a movie and was the queef joke at the beginning of the film supposed to be empowering fucking really its the same as a bad fart joke fuck this sexist film it hinders women instead of empowering them and before you assume shit im a girl and dont give me this internalized misogyny bullshit either it doesnt exist
Jul 11 2016,negative,complete s and full of obvious feminist propaganda
Jul 11 2016,negative,ghostbusters is a horror from start to finish
Jul 11 2016,negative,there might have been worse movies but im not sure ive seen them  seriously i shelled out 20 plus popcorn for this  this was horrible and the creators should feel bad
Jul 11 2016,negative,it is a bad movie of that there can be no doubt the cast do try and thats evident but the story line is so weak even the best in the world could save it i went to see it to review it for a local paper and frankly im glad i didnt pay to see it vastly underwhelming and fully deserving to bomb for its poor attempt at humour and weak plot worst still it cant seem to deside what age group its aimed at the best part of it is chris hemsworth who ends up being the funniest of the lot the film is sexist towards men with all male charecters being portrayed as either stupid or evil its just as well the cast is female because if this had been gender swaped with the women in the male roles of the movie this would be derided as the most sexist film ever made
Jul 11 2016,negative,i laughed at few times but it was still at best 4510 movie  at times i was really hoping the movie would end  15
Jul 11 2016,negative,awful movie  pathetic story poor humor and just plain dull
Jul 11 2016,positive,goodfungood vfx it has all 3 and well good but litle bit dual
Jul 11 2016,positive,i was fortunate enough to be invited to the premier in la on saturday and the movie was fabulous funny and scary supporting a great script with these four talented female comedians makes this reboot a whacky slimy ride worth the price admissiona must see that will inspire young girls for sure
Jul 11 2016,negative,someone had better call the real ghostbusters because we obviously have a problem here  this film made a number of big mistakes the biggest was pretending in the first trailer to be a sequel it should have been even if it were a lame sequel that would have been easier to forgive than this terrible reboot  sexist jokes that fall flat especially against the backdrop of accusations of fam sexism somethings rotten in denmark and its this film if you feel that you must see it wait til it hits netflix   youll still be disappointed but at least youll save money
Jul 11 2016,positive,the movie may not live up to its full potential but its still a lot of fun
Jul 11 2016,positive,saw this last night with my little sister and would like to say it was absolutely brilliant laughed so much our asthma kicked in definitely would watch again it has a mix of horror and comedic scenes with sweet visuals please go and see you wont regret it
Jul 11 2016,negative,unfunny women that turned the ghostbuster franchise into a dirty vagina joke paul feig has a lot to answer for in the making of this film
Jul 11 2016,positive,i went into this movie expecting to be disappointed surprisingly the film is not bad i would certainly not compare it to the 1984 masterpiece as they are very different but i dont think any ghostbusters film will beat the first there is a great deal of humor the cast is strong together especially kate mckinnon and chris hemsworth although the film has its campy and corny moments and there are plenty of areas where a little more tender loving care could have made this better overall it surpassed what i expected from the trailers i hope there is the opportunity to have a sequel because i kind of want to see what happens next with this gang id also like to see feig have the opportunity to correct a few missteps its not the ghostbusters we remember but thats okay 4 stars
Jul 11 2016,negative,didnt really care for the old ghostbusters movie was too young to this was just a bad movie all controversial issues aside on each side nothing meshed everything felt disjointed and rushed  and horrible cgi it wasnt a good movie
Jul 11 2016,negative,too much political trash trying to cover up a bad movie trailer    1 opening scene is a tour of a haunted mansion  the history involves a lords daughter that was born crazy and murdered all the servants in their sleep  shes been locked up in a room and even the officials have never opened the door because stupid  still hundreds of years later they havent checked if shes dead yet  we can assume shes a dead but who da fuk cares about the law right    2 man dies because she wakes up finally queue the old school gb music best part of the movie and title appears    3 cuts to university girl1 i still dont know what her name is practicing speech like a retard that has no idea about math or science  owner of haunted mansion shows up asking for help  cut to game of thrones tywin lannister bad as leader of the university  were gonna review you for tenure tomorrow dont let us find out that you did anything bad in the past  like said the word nigger as a child  were irrational and stupid enough to fire a good professor for nothing and keep the bad ones  i have no idea why tywin would say a sexist thing and about your clothes  i really didnt get the joke  is she too sexy or not slutty enough to be a professor  maybe shes just too nerdy  some people have no clue what real professors of science look like      4 ah erin holtsman bla bla stupid joke about soup being too much water and wow  really bad queef joke  really bad  no seriously  really bad    4a  queef joke  hey have you heard of the new cvf machine we made  it can record the deads voices  she answers no did you actually make it work  they go over to the recording machine  then press play and the display goes and all you hear is static  she moves her face closer to the speaker trying to hear anything  then you hear a loud shocking fart sound blaaaaaffp  everyone is shocked and then laughter ensues  ha ha ha you fell for it  would it be funnier if we told you it was from the front    ok that was the first 10 minutes of the movie  you know its bad when the positive reviews are 100 wrong and the negative reviews are 100 right within the first 10 minutes  this movie is making history the discovery of a new type of bad movie  using sexism racism and any political correctness to sell a complete shit of a movie    edit after thinking about it i think i figured out what went wrong with this movie  the movie was originally made for young children and this would have been a fairly good movie if they didnt make all those last minute changes  you can tell because all fun moments were cut out and half the plot in the movie makes sense when you piece it together  for example the thriller moment when the main bad guy makes the entire us army dance  in the movie it doesnt make sense because they cut it out  why is everyone frozen with their arms up and why the strange cut  well in the credits after the movie is over they were suppose to be dancing and it would have been better to just leave that in  also some of the trailer scenes were added as a response  its bad when the trailer scenes were not even in the movie  they were in the end credit scenes after the movie is over  clearly added in as a response to the bad 1st trailer  it almost seems like the movie was rushed and they didnt have time to cut edit and paste the scenes together properly  instead they were like fuck it and released an unfinished product  oh well  as long as people still pay for shit this thing will sell
Jul 11 2016,positive,hilarious well written even with 3 specific bumps in the road that i just did not enjoy i loved this movie if youre skeptical its worth giving a shot you cant even compare this to the original so there is no worries of it tainting your precious memories with several homages paid to the original you should definitely keep your eyes open great effects with the exception of 1 specific moment especially if youre seeing this in 3d the force awakens is far more similar to a new hope than gb 2016 is to the 1984 original give this film a shot and you wont regret it i had an incredibly good time at this film i gave it five stars because i couldnt stop grinning the entire time it was just a blast
Jul 11 2016,negative,leslie jones character is terrible stereotype they could have done something entirely different for that character but they chose to stick with the most racial stereotype the plot didnt work the chemistry didnt work even tho the acting wasnt bad and holy hell the end boss fight managed to take this movie down to a new level of terrible
Jul 11 2016,negative,not horrible not great its just there and not very funny either
Jul 11 2016,positive,i was lucky enough to see this film 5 days early in new york and i was not let down as a matter of fact i was completely not ready for the amazing film i had just saw i loved there use of old items people that we loved spread tastefully threw out the film dont judge until you have seen as you may be eating your own words
Jul 11 2016,negative,one of the worst movies ever single handily killed a franchise shares nothing in tone or character with the originals avoid at all costs
Jul 11 2016,negative,no worth it simple cash in movie and god forbid they try a second
Jul 11 2016,positive,loved it kate mckinnon stole the the show would happily watch this again  locations and characters were great and the plot was a lot better than the trailers let on to
Jul 11 2016,negative,dont believe the anything higher than 2 and up stars     i watch the advance screening and read the novel and boy it was awful from start to finish    force humor i wont spoil this joke from the movie but i find this joke not funny and it does happen in real life    rehashing scenes from ghostbusters 1 and 2     cameos fell flat but the rest is a train wreck      12 is for chris hemsworth and i always think as you as thor      this movie is pretty much like dragonball evolutionthe last airbender and fantastic 4 reboot for ghostbusters fans but with a bigger budget      and im pretty sure the extended edition dvd is not worth the price too    im very disappointed and  feel sorry for ivan reitman who agreed to take part in this movie and the rest of the crew     paul feig i enjoyed you as tim from heavyweights but im sorry this movie is not good     parents i recommend not take youre kids to go see this movie and go take them to the secret life of pets or finding dory instead    to ivan reighman and dan akyord when making the new cartoon do us a favor have it connected to the original ghostbusters movie not this reboot  ghost corps needs a reboot and have it connected to original ghostbusters instead
Jul 11 2016,positive,well  hard to say but interesting
Jul 11 2016,negative,just a waste of money
Jul 11 2016,negative,most of the reviewers who are giving this a good rating bash most of it in their reviews
Jul 11 2016,negative,a group of humorless movie would have been better with tina fey and amy palmer
Jul 11 2016,positive,ignore the haters just got back from seeing this and really enjoyed it the first 10 mins is really slow and had me worried but it got going after that  if you love the original  which i do by the way  you will love this    ps i have not been paid by sony for this review
Jul 11 2016,positive,i give this 3 stars it doesnt deserve the hate its getting but its not the greatest movie either its a good movie but i prefer the original movie
Jul 11 2016,negative,the movie started ok but then went in left field  the jokes were not that funny  it was nice to see the cameos of the original cast though
Jul 11 2016,positive,heard that theres actual social media campaign to sink this movie because wait for it the ghostbusters are gurrlllzz thats right there are people so sexist out there that they are even upset about women being things that are imaginary and going on about having reverence for the original which if you watched it was one long and glorious celebration of irreverence probably why
Jul 11 2016,positive,i managed to see an early showing of this and have to say that i was thoroughly impressed ive been buzzing for this movie since it was first announced so i already had high hopes the original ghostbusters were among my favourite movies growing up and i found myself concerned that the feel of the originals would be lost nonetheless id have likely still enjoyed it as a separate entity carrying the familiar title    as the movie began it became very clear that it certainly lives up to its namesake it has a similar atmosphere to the originals with the right mixture of horror and comedy the opening scene is certainly on par with the opening of the first movie in the 80s a big smile came across my face as the first scene ended and i instantly knew that this was a ghostbusters movie and it was going to be great    the trailer would have you believe that the comedy in the movie is mostly slapstick and screamy which is a shame because actually there is very little of this kind of behaviour in the film it retains the iconic subtle clever humour of the originals while expanding on it and including other types of humour    all 5 of the main stars were fabulous on screen chris hemsworth is the highlight as the ditsy keving and i really dont think the stupidity of this character was over worked hes just loveable     all of the women were brilliant and id hate to drag on discussing their performances but i think the most notable were lesley jones and kate mckinnon kate is literally hypnotic to watch on screen a delicate blend of zany intellectual hyper and sassy all rolled into one cute bundle of blonde bombshell    my only real issue with the movie is the ending seemed a little rushed the final battle was expected to be a huge showdown but it was over before it even really started id have enjoyed a little more danger however this is not enough to lose a star     i feel biased because im a huge ghosthead but this has been my favourite movie this year in my humble opinion thats even taking civil war into consideration my previous favourite    if you have even a passing interest in this movie i highly suggest you head over and see it at the cinema ignore the internet hate and make your mind up for yourself i assure you you will have fun and youll be glad you went in    final note stay until after the credits 
Jul 11 2016,negative,take ghostbusters  add in slapstick grossout humor and look at fatty be so fat jokes      the result looks like a wayans bros genrespoof series
Jul 11 2016,positive,forget about the past this is a fantastic new reincarnation of the franchise it sets up all the characters with a brilliant cast and tells a fun story go see it to escape reality its funny too 
Jul 11 2016,positive,this film is better than ghostbusters ii i went to see this film as it received a lot of hate before it had come out i didnt think the trailers looked too bad im neither an sjw nor a nerd i do love the original ghostbusters some of my favourite films are classics jaws jurassic park etc this isnt a classic but its good its funny and its better than the other tent pole summer hits in 2016 im looking at you independence day and you xmen apocalypse     the bad the cameos are awful they are clunky they kill the scenes and stop the movie some of the jokes fall flat very occasionally some of the acting isnt great chris hemsworth maybe played it a little to dumb    the god the jokes this film will make you laugh all the way through theres a few belly laughs and lots of chuckles the effects nb i saw this in 2d are great the ghosts are cartoony yet scary people said they look bad they dont and personally i am a fan of practical effect work this looks better than most because the ghosts are other worldly they dont look odd the plot is functional different enough not to be boring there are also a couple of stand out scenes that will impress you where the film finds it feet my other half enjoyed the dynamic of the girls and how they handled power tools     summary i enjoyed it it made me laugh it was different i wasnt bored like in some other effects driven films id scene recently i would heartily recommend this to anyone who wants to go and see a fun movie who enjoyed the original ghostbusters     and yes it is better than ghostbusters ii which i recently rewatched which had far more clunky acting poor script choices and actors dialling in their lines     give this film a chance its an underdog that didnt deserve the preemptive backlash and when you give it a chance youll find its actually fun funny and different yes its not perfect but its better than many other summer blockbusters heres to more in the franchise when its unshackled from the crushing cameos and the herd mind
Jul 11 2016,negative,you cannot reboot with a all women cast it is like rebooting wonder woman as a male cross dresser   be more original hollywood or make them be the daughters of the original ghostbusters
Jul 11 2016,negative,nobody asked for this stupid movie
Jul 11 2016,positive,i missed out on a lot of the controversy before but this was simply brilliant gags spot on they even kept the scienceculture humor that made the first one so special even the cameos actually worked
Jul 11 2016,negative,released today and ireland and went to see what all the fuss was about    unfortunately mostly a negative experience for me    barely any of the jokes hit for me the fan service was awful i didnt see enough chemistry amongst the main cast the villain was one dimensional and nothing he did made sense the set up for more movies was dumb the plot drove the movie too much and many turns in the plot didnt make sense to me motivations etc the lead characters relationship wasnt convincing to me and was bored when they were on screen together i also do not understand the love for mckinnons character i found her goofy and off the walls in a bad way    some things save this from being a big fat f from me hemsworth was funny most of the time although they did push his dumbness too far i actually really liked jones character as she grew on me through the movie although a couple of her jokes fell flat the aldridge mansion sequence was great including the ghost     it gets an even d from me escaping an f i would tell others to wait until its on tv or something not worth your time    i have more specific issues but wont spoil for everyone    my opinion
Jul 11 2016,positive,not perfect by any means but a hilarious film that makes great use of a near perfect cast dont believe the negativity that built up before this just people who cant accept change
Jul 11 2016,positive,fresh and funny with a little nostalgia made this film thoroughly enjoyable
Jul 11 2016,negative,holtzmann your a brilliant engineer  erin no one is better than quantum phyics than you  and i am melissa mccarthy queen bitch watch my movie      the stories from the original movies were much better  this movie lacks creativity
Jul 11 2016,positive,absolutely loved this film loved the humor and cameos and it stands alone it is its own thing i love the original and i love this
Jul 11 2016,positive,i liked it way better than i thought i would the trailer made it seem more ridiculous that it needed to be
Jul 11 2016,negative,special effects modern feminism and a copy of the 1984 movie  nothing else
Jul 11 2016,negative,hoped for better paul feig amy pascal along with sony should be ashamed
Jul 11 2016,positive,great film  the first trailer wasnt good and generated a tidal wave of hate  but the movie was ace
Jul 11 2016,positive,rebooted with an all female lead cast ghostbusters is a remake of the 1984 original and is about a group of scientists who believe in ghosts and use their intellect to stop someone from unleashing the paranormal world upon the human world now we all saw the trailers we all saw that dislike ratio the most disliked trailer on youtube and we all saw the negative comments i cant lie i did walk into this film hoping it was going to be badbut it wasnt not only was it good it was actually the most fun ive had this whole summer season of blockbusters straight up this is a great cast the ghostbusting team have such great chemistry especially kristen wiig who i am a massive fan of and kate mckinnon chris hemsworth was surprisingly funny and even the many cameos from the original speaking of cameos there are a lot of easter eggs in this film that link to the original which many fans will enjoy ive now come to realise anything director paul feig bridesmaids and spy does its just going to be great the direction was great the script was funny and the characters had depth the visuals for the paranormal entities looked superb and the effects for the proton guns looked very similar to the original which was a nice touch the villain in the film was underdeveloped and weak but this is only a minor setback overall this is a solid entertaining reboot with a great cast and a funny script that will delight newcomers and fans alike     review at 
Jul 11 2016,negative,cant believe i wasted my money on this shit never again
Jul 11 2016,negative,do not watch this piece of garbage
Jul 11 2016,negative,i finally caved in and watched the movie i wasnt expecting much to be honest  and by that i mean ive set the bar so low that even an earthworm couldnt limbo under it    and this movie still managed to disappoint me its a bad movie bad in every respect its the driest comedy the cartooniest scifi flick the most snooze inducing action movie and the least investing piece of cinematography ive ever seen in my life i thought its gonna be b movie bad or even so bad its good but nope none of that and that comes from a guy that watches b movies and straighttovideos for fun i couldnt crack even the faintest smile even at the things that could be considered so bad that its funny if ireally tried theres nothing but an incoherent mess    i could go on about character development the representation of men and black people the flat elementary school level jokes or just the whole idea overall but im actually so deflated that i cant muster the willpower to do it that dedication to harold ramis was just the final slap in the face followed by the humiliating cameos    certified fresh is a cruel joke
Jul 11 2016,positive,very fun very funny in many ways extremely respectful of the original material wish id seen it in theaters
Jul 11 2016,negative,i am very frustrated  this movie was horrible i went due to reviews on this site now after reading redditit appears there are fake reviews on youtube and here to get people to go to the movie latest case on youtube is a paid youtuber by feig to give the movie a good review really then if you look on imdb it has not been shown in the uk but two people form the uk have given it 10 starshow is that possible further proof i saw this movie and it is nothing but male bashing geared toward women that hate men and this garbage movie is not funny read the reviews on imdb and avoid the reviews form the paid scammers form the uk wait for this movie to come out on cable and watch it free or wait for pbs or netflix this movie is  a waste of money
Jul 11 2016,positive,all the fuss was for nothing its a good movie no its not perfect neither was the original and there are some slow scenes but i laughed out loud several times and overall really enjoyed it
Jul 11 2016,positive,i thought the new ghostbusters movie was great im not going to give out any spoilers just a quick review overall it was funny and action packed there were some amazing special effects with the exception of a few very minor roles the acting was great the characters were well developed and unique not just a rehash of the original cast in comparing it to the original movies the plot was actually a bit different sure there were four characters seeking to bust ghosts but the incentive development and methods were totally different there was more emphasis on the development of the tools more comedy or maybe just more of my type of humor and definitely more action there was less of a focus on book research and no real romance in the story it was definitely scarier than the original for you parents it is rated pg13 i will be taking my 7 and 8 year old children to see it but i will have a talk with them first about how it is just a movie and the peril is not real im pretty sure the pg13 rating is due to some smoking seen on screen which i totally missed the use of the middle finger as a crude gesture some mild language and violence it was not at all bloody or gory but there were implied off screen deaths i laughed out loud several times jumped a few times in surprise and was cheering by the end those who are fans of the original will likely appreciate that the new movie had several jokes nods and references to the originals i emerged from the theater with my childhood intact a smile on my face and a desire to build myself a new proton pack
Jul 11 2016,negative,i hate this remake i am gonna wait for the next remake but its okay but i still hate it
Jul 11 2016,positive,i think the same people who hate this movie also joined the dixie chicks backlash hate 10 years ago just because they have no original thoughts of their own and suffer group think     when the world is as it is today so much hate due to a divided country worldwide terrorist attacks etc its nice to see movies that empowers individuality intelligence and still sticks to legacy thematic traditions eg big govt is no bueno go get smart and nerdy and slimer     the movie had all plenty of character development it was able to actually be funnyscarypersonable at the same time  i also really appreciated it antibullying theme wish there were more movies like this
Jul 11 2016,negative,this was one of the most terrible movies ive ever seen its an insult to the original
Jul 11 2016,negative,the biggest pile of sh1t ive ever seen truly awful
Jul 11 2016,negative,just awful marketing budget apparently goes along way to pay for positive reviews
Jul 11 2016,negative,boring and mediocre a waste of the potential from the brand
Jul 11 2016,negative,another reboot flop
Jul 11 2016,positive,ghostbusters is a satisfying film that works more often then it doesnt and as far as unnecessary remakes of classic films it is among the better ones the cast is game with each lead delivering strong performances with plenty of jokes that land despite a few running gags that got obnoxious after a while paul fieg improved how he directs action with this film which was a pleasant surprise that ghosts in the film look impressive more often then notwith some creative designs on display in places it captures the same mix of horror and comedy that made the original film a classic but it never quite reaches those heights its a worth while film that does what it set out to do with amiable aplomb that it proves by the end it deserves
Jul 11 2016,negative,so many fake reviews here i had to set the record straight this movie sucks period
Jul 11 2016,negative,for a reboot it relies on too many callbacks to the original series
Jul 11 2016,negative,not as funny as ghostbusters ii    is what i would say unfortunately the film was just boring it felt rushed with no real payoff     its so pathetic and sad to see a film thats become this socialpolitical movie save your money and give your money to charity instead of a corporation thats selling you this guiltridden movie
Jul 11 2016,positive,so just back from seeing ghostbusters it was actually pleasantly surprising obviously this is not a 21st century make on a classic it has its own flavour the comedy was spot on with some absolutely cracking one liners ok so of the action is a bit cheesy and the ending needed polishing but overall defiantly worth seeing dont judge it just because you love the classic this is good and deserves merit
Jul 11 2016,negative,this should never had been attempted some things are best left in the past
Jul 11 2016,positive,genuinely more exciting thrilling scary and funnier than the original never thought it was possible
Jul 11 2016,negative,a shockingly bad movie
Jul 11 2016,positive,funny clever brilliantly written the women of the 21st century ghostbusters almost outshine their male predecessors
Jul 11 2016,negative,other than the special effects the movie was terrible
Jul 11 2016,positive,not bad   chris hemsworth was good
Jul 11 2016,positive,this movie has a an excellent blend of horror science fiction and comedy im surprised to say it but feigs humor works well to this beloved franchise
Jul 11 2016,negative,on the scale of 1 to 10 this is mariah careys glitter bad    i havent walked out of the movie in such a long time believe me when i say that i wanted to give this movie a chance i left work an hour early to see this and 30 minutes in i was disappointed so that i wanted to rip off my arm and throw at the screen said arm has venkman tattooed on it i waited until bill murray showed up and the great man himself could not save it for me     i need a weekend in amsterdam to forget that i watched this the best part were the trailers before the movie
Jul 11 2016,positive,89 the classic remains superior but on its own this movie is a hilarious exciting and entertaining reboot of the franchise that took the world by storm
Jul 11 2016,positive,the first half of the movie is fun but the rest just derails into confusion it was good to see the feminine version though
Jul 11 2016,negative,meh clearly not meant for fans of the original why they used the franchise is not quite clear but not an atrocious watch either as the trailer might initially have suggested
Jul 11 2016,positive,this film was a revelation it was not only very funny but for the most very exciting the four leads were amazing and chris as the dumb guy was surprisingly good and fun this movie will show not only women but also men that all different groups can be ghostbusters
Jul 11 2016,negative,whos the stiff dont mess with the original man theyre scientists  why did they ever agree on a reboot hollywood egos need lancing every once in awhile and its clearly time again for them to be reminded that they cant deficate on silver and turn it into gold you cant take an iconic irreverent comedy like ghostbusters assign an irrelevant artiste of a director who has no grasp whatsoever of what made the original great to film a remake of it and expect to get your money back may as well assign sam taylorjohnson to film a reboot of animal house starting adam sandler rob schneider kevin james will ferrell and david spade and expect a warm reception or in an effort to appear edgy  turning society on its ear make it a sorority instead of fraternity ugh morons in hollywood
Jul 11 2016,positive,this reboot got people how bad it was but watching it was wrong     this reboot not only surpass the sequal     but started in a diffrent cottanunity so i say check it out you will have fun with it
Jul 11 2016,positive,the first part is almost boring some late humor almost saves it here kristen wiig is just annoiyng
Jul 11 2016,negative,kate mckinnon puts some effort in but im already struggling to remember it
Jul 11 2016,positive,this was such an amazing movie loved the comedy action and most of all the actors chemistry cannot wait to see it again
Jul 11 2016,negative,lame jokes best part was catching the cameos
Jul 11 2016,negative,i like to say upfront that the remixed version of the ghost busters theme is actually good the graphics are excellent and thats where it stops being good    id like to begin with the main female leads of the story with the exception of two there are cardboard cutouts of stereotypes that have zero characterisation to them they are there simply because of the plot demands they are there while the other two have some characterisation into their motives most of the film revolves around these two characters being childish with each other you left me for your career and im going to rub your face in it  the other noticeable thing is that there are many jokes aimed at men their receptionist is just a male version of the blonde ditz to the point that the main characters have to tell him to pick up a phone and not immediately put it back down again    whether this is supposed to be comedic seems a good case of trying to hard when the actor gets a bit of time to actually act later on in the film he steals the show    the plot itself is poorly planned out with more homages to the original the sad fact of seeing bill murray act out a role that was just his role reversal form the first movie and then exited out of the movie it tries ti best to honour the original and ends up walking all over it    all in all it seemed rather much like any other film that based on action much like mad max fury road all action and nothing of substance it was a reboot that was neither warranted nor needed its a sad fact to say that ghost busters 2 actually did a better job of being more entertained  peace
Jul 11 2016,positive,i went into this movie with no expectations as the trailers made the movie look like a cheap gag that would leave everyone in the theatre with a bad taste in their mouths  i am very happy to say that this movie is excellent and i encourage everyone to go give this movie support as i feel it deserves all the money it can possibly get btw the marketing for this movie has to be the worst yet as this movie is rad
Jul 11 2016,neutral,90 of the jokes just fell flat for me it had lots of silly kids jokes mixed with blatant sex jokes particularly in the first half of the film the second half however was a lot more fun really made the ticket price worthwhile   a lot of people complained about how the ghosts looked in the trailers but didnt have a problem with them i particularly liked the large pagent balloon ones  i also enjoyed all the cameos but i just cant bring this movie to fresh 295
Jul 11 2016,negative,terrible terrible movie
Jul 11 2016,positive,fun reimagining tone in line with the animated series from the late 80s fun effects kate mckinnon is amazing
Jul 11 2016,negative,if you want to save yourself the ticket price go watch the original 1984 ghostbusters film
Jul 11 2016,negative,was absolutely terrible
Jul 11 2016,positive,i am not a top movie critic however i can say this film was 100 worth going to see the misogyny and sexism that plaugued the initial reaction to the film has been destroyed by the female cast in the film who proved that yes women can be funny and can be kickass ghostbusters
Jul 11 2016,negative,i tried to like it i really did but this felt more like a parody than an actual reboot or ode to the original the jokes were poorly done and relied too much on toilet humor almost felt like i was watching family guy for a second there
Jul 11 2016,negative,terrible movie forced jokes racial stereotypes in the main characters generic and bland story there is nothing redeeming about this movie other than its ghostbusters but somehow it managed to mess even that up
Jul 11 2016,positive,as a tshirt owning box set at christmas ghostbuster fan i am sadded by the men folk trying to spam a low score  redit report today this isnt a remake it is a hip hip horray love letter to find the next male replacements for our ghosting 4 someone would have been far more hainous a crime   so the pace is great plenty of laughs a classy use of cameos even into the end credits and helmsworth steals the show maybe im reading too deeply but thor and andy garcia as the haplass damsels in destress is a nice 21st  twist on the super hero buddy film at no stage are the girls trying to be men they accept their short comings and work together to save the day oh and they didnt try to change the theme tune too much class
Jul 11 2016,negative,this movie lacks the soul that the original ghostbusters movie had the unfortunate thing is that the sjws behind this movie decided to use the beloved ghostbusters ip for their movement
Jul 11 2016,positive,great summer movie with highlight performances from melissa mccarthy and chris hemsworth
Jul 11 2016,positive,it was a nice mixture of  new and nostalgia the comedy was rich and reoccurring even if a bit childish the cameos were appropriate and pleasent who else caught the bust of harold ramis outside of erins office at the university i will most definately go see this film again i love kevin and holtzman
Jul 11 2016,negative,there is little to say that hasnt been said one of the greatest missed opportunities in modern cinema
Jul 11 2016,negative,this movie is full of forced humor geared towards children or people with bad sense of humor the ghosts are too neonlooking and there is no lore that the previous ghostbusters movies tried to implement about the villian  every cameo was a cheesy attempt to provide a nostalgia factor into the movie all while turning away any nostalgic person wanting to see a continuation of the original      to add to the confusion none of the sciency stuff was ever truly explained  for example they go from trying to lasso ghosts using the neutrino wand and trapping themto straight up destroying the ghosts with pistolpunching and sideflipping antics  to call this a ghostbusters movie is a travesty because this movie is just a grab for money due of the popularity of the original
Jul 11 2016,negative,ive had dental procedures that were more entertaining
Jul 11 2016,negative,this movie is an insult to the original   its length of disgust and act is pathetic pathetic
Jul 11 2016,negative,was not goot at all
Jul 11 2016,neutral,not as bad as i thought it would be gave me some laughs but the forced cameos felt like they were being thrown at us every 15 mins stars of the movie have to be hemsworth  mckinnon they were hilarious
Jul 11 2016,negative,let to me tell you right off the bat i grew up on ghostbusters  i love the original the cartoon series the comic book even the sequel which has its faults so when i heard that the series was getting a reboot i was a little apprentious not because of the cast i am a big fan kristen wiig but because of the director  i enjoyed bridesmaids but found spy unfunny and reliant on improvisation over a decent script  these fears werent eased by terrible trailers marketing and not to mention that awful fall out boy song  but positive reviews made me think there was a glimmer hope that maybe i was wrong  sadly  i wasnt  it fails not only as a ghostbusters movie but also as a comedy  the first 5 minutes or so you think youre in safe hands when that classic ray parker jnr song sparks up and the ghostbusters title appears on screen but its all down hill from there  not only are the jokes obvious they are also mostly nonsense  theres a continued joke about soup for crying out loud soup  it even pokes fun at the fraction of mysognists on youtube who claimed that women cant be ghostbusters which i guess is paul feigs way of saying fyou to the audiance which i dont think we needed and further prevents this ghostbusters from standing up as a film in its own right      its been claimed that paul feig made this political by making all the ghostbusters female however i do feel that most of the humour was patronising towards women  theres several boob jokes in there and it doesnt take the film 10 minutes before we get a fanny fart gag  what this film lacks is balance  all the male characters are portrayed as idiots especially chris hemsworth who is a a moron of the highest order and for some reason has gone his whole life without know how to answer the telephone  incidentally theres also a joke which was featured in the trailer about a phone in the fish tank  a fish tank  why is a phone in a fish tank  fck knows    enough about the jokes what about the story  well youve already seen it before   in 1984 in a film called ghostbusters  beat for beat its the same from start to finish  this seems to be a common trend with reboots and sequels  star wars managed to do successfully as it introduced new interesting characters  the recent independence day resergence failed miserable with a retread of the first minus the charisma and fun  this takes the jurassic world route of making the least of suble references to its precessors which only makes you want to go back and watch them as a reminder of how its done properly  bill murray dan aykroyd annie potts and sigourney weaver all return in brief camoes which seemed shoehorned in to appease the audiance of the original but basically seem like little side sketches that bring the film to a holt and reek of desperation  at one point i was expecting kermit the frog to appear on screen and say welcome to the ghostbusters show and our special guest this week is bill murray     the cgi is very cartoonish with bright neon colours which is more reminiscent of the real ghostbusters cartoon and because its all cgi it wasnt particually scary    i think we definitely wont be seeing these ghostbusters call again  if we do i wont be seeing it
Jul 11 2016,negative,one word  disappointing i was willing to give it the benefit of doubt having sat through the pain today i can honestly say i shouldnt have bothered there is zero chemistry between the central characters the humour is not funny and the lines delivered in a way that seems forced i expected so much more from some established actresses but it looked as though they were reading from autocue on every line hemsworth is mildly funny but the character verges to far on comic book daft for me the only saving grace  the chi is amazing take out the comparison to the original as this doesnt hold a candle to it and judge it for what it is  poor should they attempt to do more i hope they go back to the first step and start again
Jul 11 2016,positive,loved it fun and entertaining great performances on all female characters
Jul 11 2016,positive,although it lacks a lot of big laughs ghostbusters is a surprisingly fun film with great chemistry between the four leads
Jul 11 2016,positive,pretty fun kate mckinnon and chris hemsworth completely kill it
Jul 11 2016,negative,this film lacked humour chemistry and the shock factor everything felt so forced it was like i was watching that scooby doo film with the monsters and ghosts on the island the only good thing was the original casts 2 min cameos
Jul 11 2016,positive,actually fairly good while not as good as the original it is better than ghostbusters 2 fans of the original will enjoy the cameos and little and not so little easter egg nods to the original
Jul 11 2016,positive,it was a shame that the screenplay seemed underwritten the editing appeared occasionally sloppy and the characters were surprisingly flat however if theres one area in which the movie truly succeeds it must be the phantasmagorical and uninhibited playground that it provides the talented cast to thrive in its glaringly obvious that the actors had loads of fun making the film and that reads well during oneliners improvised moments and especially the hilarious end credits which were the best part and that may sound like an insult but it is anything but lets forgive the films manifold flaws theres more than enough on the positive end of the scale to make up for them
Jul 11 2016,positive,the movie made me laugh out loud a couple times so easily worth the time and money  i watched it in 3d  it was fun
Jul 11 2016,positive,saw it today really enjoyed it could have done without some of the original cast being it in as cameos but hey ho maybe a bit longslow in places too but overall it was good fun
Jul 11 2016,negative,whatr do you call a movie with bad comedy cgi a stupid male character trope and an obvious villain    shit even bvs is better than this reboot watch the original
Jul 11 2016,negative,glad i got my money back but i will never get the time wasted on this hogwash back this movie tried to be the action movie equivalent of bridesmaids while dragging a beloved franchise down with its terrible jokes and acting melissa mcarthy could have done so much better in this movie by not having been in it its just fitting for her typecast and only served to drag down the other characters who had to bow to her big fat funny one jokes the whole time
Jul 11 2016,negative,the film that divided the internet from sony is a negative star anticlassic
Jul 11 2016,positive,the 2016 reboot ghostbusters is amazing i partly remember most of the original ghostbusters but not all of it cause i didnt watch it all the way  this film had a kinda same story to the original but most of it looked original very nicely done music funny jokes  amazing cgi in the mixed  my only downside is that i didnt catch the jokes until after i heard them  some scenes felt predictable  but other than that this movie is amazing id recommend it to any fan of the old ghostbusters and fans of movies and cgi oh and wait after the credits youll know why  anyways i give ghostbusters 2016 a 90 out of 10 an amazing film that shouldnt have had hate from the first trailer came out
Jul 11 2016,negative,a remake that is just a complete embarrassment to big budget a movies this movie is nothing more than a political driven flick hence the good reviews that say the movie is badaverage but end up giving it a positive rating anyway its all due to the political stuff sony and the crew of this movie have used scare tactics to get good reviews because if you hate this film you must be a sexist im a girl does hating this make me sexist with literally no intention of being original weve seen everything in this before in movies like the original ghostbusters duh men in black and ripd or an actual good movie weve heard every single joke in here before in the scary movie films its that bad and anything with adam sandler in it    the only good thing about this entire mess is chris hemsworth his parts are legit the only ones i laughed at but at the same time i felt sorry for him because like every other male in this movie he is made to look like a complete and utter moron the main villain is smart but a total ahole the entire movie in its attempt to be all antisexist girl porwer ends up being completely sexist towards men and is just a slap in the face to fans of the original movies     the special effects are terrible and look like something youd see in the live action scooby doo movies from 20022004 the final battle being the worst looking thing in the entire movie the new ghostbusters have literally zero chemistry with each other and every single one of their jokes comes off  as try hard and just falls flat they new gbs are nothing more than youre typical typecast roles female or male you have the cool one the awkward one the quirky one and the loud token black one  literally nothing about the new characters is original good or funny    this movie is awful and comes off more as scary movie 6 instead of a new ghostbusters film seriously this is more like a spoof movie than a big budget blockbuster save your cash and avoid seeing this trash
Jul 11 2016,negative,very bland and a ripoff of the 1980 original characters have no real emotions nor profession through the plot and are carbon copies of the original would stay away from at all costs
Jul 11 2016,positive,hugely entertaining fabulously fun smiled through the entire movie busting still makes me feel good all these years on only weak points being a brief slow down of pace after the initial scenes which quickly picks up again    great stuff
Jul 11 2016,negative,nice paid campaign to give positive reviews
Jul 11 2016,negative,worst nightmare ever and i cant believe sony paid for good ratings
Jul 11 2016,positive,way better than i expected comedy a little on the silly side but was to be expected from the trailer great to have gb back
Jul 11 2016,negative,truly truly awful  after a few initial laughs the weak script shines through  the chuckles disappear   it tries too hard to be funny with cultural references coming in every direction in an embarrassing attempt to look cool    acting is ok in parts but chris hemsworth may have the worst comic timing ive ever seen on the big screen to the point where you are cringing every time he appears    a very pale imitation of the original even the cameos cant help it    if your going to see it think of it as a bad version of bridesmaid with sfx  you wont be disappointed
Jul 11 2016,positive,this wasnt as silly and over the top as i thought it was going to be quite a few genuinely funny moments hemsworth is great at acting dumb having an all female crew stunned me at first i didnt think it would work but it did stop me from comparing them to the original cast some of which were in this movie as much as i may have if they were all male obviously being up to date the visual effects were really good very bright  colourful ghosties the main down point for me was the soundtrack not being as good as i was hoping though i still found myself tapping my foot when the main theme played   you can sit through the whole end credits as there is stuff to watch throughout and then there is a short post credit scene teasing a sequel 810
Jul 11 2016,negative,im more disenfranchised with the abject toxicity of the movies promoters than the actual film which i will admit is a rotten tomatos throw from my reaction to it i have not seen anyone so utterly disrespectful toward a generation of sci fi fans since the production of star wars episodes iiii yes the ones that sucked all that aside i honestly could care less how the movie does because the only source any of them truly care about wrote a scathing review even despite wanting to love it which if its any consolation has won my respect for maintaining their integrity im not naming names out of the utmost respect though ill give you a hint this outlet has nothing to prove
Jul 11 2016,positive,      for full review click here
Jul 11 2016,negative,bullshit no where near as good as the original it just isnt funny and no im not sexist
Jul 11 2016,positive,i loved it and want more of it     they approached it like the real ghostbusters cartoon which allowed it to expand a lot compared to if they did it like the movie     it also made some nice choices in regards to focusing on the emotional core of the film and how the team relates to the citys government really glad with those decisions     they could have put less focus on the villains individual scenes and used that time to put in some scenes of just miscillanious ghost catching that was my main gripe    but the ending really sealed it for me and made the whole thing worthwhile     sidenote am i just not seeing it or are there just no reviews titling themselves on a variation of bustin makes me feel good    it might just be that everyones avoiding doing it because its too obvious
Jul 11 2016,positive,ok im a big fan of the original its one of my favourite 80s films that being said this film is entertaining and has a great cast islots of fun and has some very amusing moments is it a masterpiece no is it a damn decent reboot with a cast who have a lot of chemistry together that also has some affectionate  callbacks to the original it is indeed look its not a masterpiece but the original never was either is it an entertaining film about four individuals hunting down ghosts it sure is
Jul 11 2016,negative,ghostbuster 2016 is a sloppy mess with no respect to the original source material paul feig and co have no idea what they are doing and the plot script special effects and jokes fall flat and cannot compare to the original 1984 comedy save your hardearned money and see the secret life of pets or star trek beyond instead
Jul 11 2016,positive,holy shit well this may just be the biggest turnaround of the year fuck it of the decade i have been shitting on this movie for ages and for good reason no not because the ghostbusters are female the morons who complain about that are absolute scum but because every trailer and every piece of promotional material has reeked of desperation been completely unfunny and had me believing this was going to be one of the worst movies of the year and then after walking out of this screening i could not believe that the movie that had been advertised like shit all year i actually liked i was so convinced from the promotional material that this was going to suck i hoped it would be good but lets be real here i had absolutely no faith in this film but despite all that this reboot prevailed it was very funny had very likeable characters a serviceable plot that dropped out a couple times but was still decent and stands on its own quite well     my biggest worry going into this film was that the humour was going to suck as every damn joke in the trailers was unfunny stupid and sighworthy now in the film almost all of those jokes still did not work but some were slightly more effective once put in context but they really did throw the worst jokes from the film into the trailers was that intentional or not was is a good thing or not two questions we may never get the answer to but who cares the final product was successful in terms of comedy all of the main characters were funny yes even leslie jones who looked terrible in the trailers did fine and shit melissa mccarthy was funny too this coming from someone who doesnt find her funny in the slightest even some of the supporting characters get jokes in here and there that are also quite funny but for me kate mckinnon and chris hemsworth steal the show in terms of humour and both with different kinds of humour kevin chris hemsworth was more of a purely comic relief caricature that was there just for the laughs and plenty of laughs there were whereas holtzmann kate mckinnon was just a very fun quirky hilarious character that brightened up almost every scene she was in with her bouncing energy tip for ghostbusters 2 more holtzmann    the comedy also stays very consistent throughout the film it drops the ball a little in the beginning of the third act but overall there are plenty of jokes to get you through the film there were a good amount of misses but jokes are fired at you every second scene so you barely notice the unfunny ones there were some cool yet brief supernatural horror elements in the film which i really appreciated and was very effective in terms of the plot of the film i thought it paced itself quite well it doesnt necessarily slow down and maintains a steady relatively fast pace the whole way through the beginning of the third act was a little average it looked like it was starting to delve into the film we had seen in the trailers but then it finishes off quite strong the film does have a villain of sorts whose main purpose is just to propel the plot forward and get us to the end but really he did get too much screen time he didnt get a lot of screen time but considering he was an uninteresting character he didnt add to the humour at all and he contributed to the most uninteresting parts of the film you could have cut his 2 minute long scenes down to 30 seconds its all we needed     so in the end much to my surprise this was a very enjoyable movie suck it haters wait thats me the characters are very likeable and very funny the supernatural elements were quite cool to see and it was an all round very positive film it touches on the nostalgic elements set by the 1984 classic but also paves the way for a new ghostbusters franchise and one that i do want to see paul feig directed this film really well and got the most out of his main cast which was good to see and dont forget to look out for cameos from a majority of the original ghostbusters cast some very good ones also there is a post credits scene if you know the original ghostbusters film well then it is worth staying for but if you dont know the original film then you wont get much out of it so when this film comes out this week have some hope it isnt bad as you may think it is i was wrong and you may be too gotta have hope     74
Jul 11 2016,positive,i didnt get the whole trolling about the ghostbusters reboot enjoyed the movie  it was frothy fun fast dialogue between the leads and chris hemsworth with his lensless glasses because they got dirty was icing on the cake  it does not try to top or remake the original 1984 it paid respectful homage to the original  the cameos were all a hoot and i cheered every one of them including the bust of dr egon spengler rip harold ramis  love the leads kate mckinnon channelling a tank girl vibe is my new favouirite  she is screwball slightly disturbing yet loveable enough and the side characters are funny too   there is a running gag about a prawn dumpling to soup ratio
Jul 11 2016,negative,this movie was a disjointed mess ghostbusters 2016 lacks the originality and heart of the movies that came before it
Jul 11 2016,positive,loved it wasnt amazing like the original but it brings its own kick to this franchise and it was well executed 
Jul 11 2016,negative,this version of ghostbusters is anything but equal they trash on men so much throughout the entire film chris hemsworth is the only main male guy and hes a stereotypical idiot useless and he is constantly harassed by the women its disgusting to see this double standard exist     the cgi is horrible in this day and age you youd think by now we could have some awesome looking cgi ghosts this movie feels like it went with the lowest bidder    leslie jones is portraying a racist and stereotypical black woman the reason the original was so great was it was four men coming together to fight ghosts it was about fighting ghosts in a serious sense and humor was secondary this one is just a slapstick humor with forced ghost elements that make no sense    im ashamed i went to an early premiere im ashamed at the film industry for producing this forced reboot and im ashamed at these sjw and politically correct reviewers who are too afraid to voice their real opinions or are being paid by sony to say something positive which has happened before this is disgrace
Jul 11 2016,negative,i dont understand how critics gave it any type of favorable review
Jul 11 2016,negative,weak plot weak characters ruined one of my favorite movies
Jul 11 2016,negative,movie was clunky and unorganized all the jokes seemed forced and nothing clicked with the cast the script seemed to have rehashed some of the most lame jokes in cinema from the past 20 years also the cgi was done in a way of a cartoon the cgi looked like pixels i would stay away from this dud
Jul 11 2016,positive,laughoutloud funny throughout thanks to an amazing ensemble cast the new ghostbusters is more a paul feigstyle comedy about busting ghosts than a ghostbusters movie directed by paul feig still the result is solid entertainment
Jul 11 2016,negative,garbage reboot am i the only one that is sick of melissa mccarthys shtick
Jul 11 2016,negative,strangely i thought the actresses was the problem theyre great to be honest the problem is almost everything else bad writing last minute editing useless cameos many scenes use as filler and many many others minors but plotholish problems
Jul 11 2016,positive,i will give this shit 5 stars just for you ro see that this is not a good font
Jul 11 2016,positive,completely surpassed my expectations not a weak link in the cast and no one tries to overshadow anyone else still laughing to myself nearly 24 hours later special effects are beautiful too kate mckinnon was my personal highlight what a hidden gem   only criticism is the villain needs to be stronger but will expect that in the sequel  already planning when to go back and watch again
Jul 11 2016,positive,this movie was great im not a fan of melissa mccarthy but even she was funny in this leslie jones was great and her character has some of the best lines  kate mckinnon and chris hemsworth stole the show the ghosts were well done but its definitely better in 3d or imax     its a bit scary for young kids though    dont let the trolls decide for you this movie breathes life into one of my favorite franchises
Jul 11 2016,negative,saw 3d version  did not laugh once  sad day
Jul 11 2016,negative,this movie was terrible it is a failed attempt of a comedy that is not funny or has any charm not even once i laughed     i did not like the characters neither the women in this movie dont act like real human beings for example they see a ghost apparition that attacks one of them yet they dont run like normal people do when attacked by an unknown foe  in the attempt to make the women in this movie appear as super brave they ended up portraying them unrealistically stupid      three of the main characters fell flat and boring they lack any story arc or coherent motivation for do what they do patty played by leslie jones was for me the only character who acted like a real person and the only likable character in this boring neon plagued disaster of a movie however her character also lacks motivation    the movie fails in every level as a comedy movie as a science fiction movie as a horror movie where it excels is in bashing men and in portraying them as either idiots incompetent or evil people     the villain is a flat cartoon without any real motivation later in the movie he acquires powers of a demigod for no reason other than emulate the original 1984 ghostbusters  villain gozer    this movie is very bad i lost 2 hours of my life watching this garbage i will never watch this movie again
Jul 11 2016,negative,painful in short segments agony at nearly 2 hours if history cites a movie that became a political statement just to see hopefully this one is not remembered so future generations dont sit back and wonder how on earth such an unfunny movie could be made
Jul 11 2016,positive,dont be fooled by those low score reviews from people who didnt watch the movie in the first place or grudgewatched it determined to hate it a lot of people invested a lot of themselves in the idea that this movie would be terrible enough to justify their misogynistic backlash against it the fact that the artificially low audience score has been climbing steadily since the movies been out and people who actually took the time to watch it are rating it tells the real story    this retelling and thats the best word for it its a different take on the same premise of 1984s allmale version of ghostbusters is fresh and new and powerful i saw it in a packed theater we booked early and were glad as it was nearly sold out an hour before showtime    the humor is a mix of the same sometimes lowbrow sometimes clever jokes and wordplay that made the original sparkle the characters are not just genderflipped versions of anything though they are original creations and while the characterization is sometimes broader its often deeper    this is a great movie to take your kids to see while its unfortunate that the studio tied the directors hands on making the orientation of kate mckinnons breakout character jillian holtzmann clear its particularly good for queer youth who are looking to see themselves in the world    it is more of an action movie than the original but the action is wellhandled and it doesnt fall into any of the more annoying action movie tropes characterization never disappears or is sacrificed because a big fx fight scene is happening it also follows a trend that was present in the most recent star wars movie of basically everybody is equally the hero no ones the damsel to be rescued the cast takes turns saving each other     while two of the characters are at odds over old hurts at the beginning throughout the length of the film they hold each other up and watch each others backs its really inspiring    also and this matters because it is still a comedy at heart the movie is laughoutloud hilarious
Jul 11 2016,negative,wont go down as a classic just felt lika a run of the mill film it is its own film though with nice cameos
Jul 11 2016,negative,despite what you hear from a few movie critics that are notorious for selling payolla their reviews to the highest studio bidder to sum up the new ghostbusters is probably the worst movie as of 2016 and it feels almost like adam sandlers pixals another terrible movie
Jul 11 2016,positive,loved it cast great leslie jones so funny mckinon great its all new and fresh with lots of nods to the original plus fun cameos and awesome effects  it was totally fun and hemsworth is super hot and wait through the credits which are loaded with stuff    ps it didnt ruin my childhood at all its the rare reboot that i can enjoy both
Jul 11 2016,negative,a disappointing nofun borderline boring ghostbustin comedy that does no justice to the 1984 original and is complete waste of great comedic talent melissa mccarthy kirsten wiig paul feig to name a few the best bits are between mccarthys character and bennie the chinese food delivery guy and an übercool ghostfighting bit by mckinnon in the movies finale
Jul 11 2016,negative,falls flat on so many levels the main cast seems to have no chemistry the overall feel reminds me of when a new cartoon would come out in the 80s or 90s to sell toys to people who love the original for its clever wit tied around lovable characters  and genuine charm i must advise to not waist time or money on this movie    disappointed in what i had hoped could bring life back into a classic but i am left with the feeling of stopping into a cheep gas station heating up a gas station burger when what i have been craving for a year is steak
Jul 11 2016,positive,solid action comedy with lots of laugh out loud moments and plenty of nods to the original including cameos from the original cast chris hemsworth is surprisingly good in his comedic role
Jul 11 2016,negative,terrible racist sexist and not funny kate mckinnon does a good job with a bad part though time and money wasted overall would have given 1 star if it was possible
Jul 11 2016,positive,awesome film cant wait to see it again  cgi anazing 
Jul 11 2016,positive,this movie was unexpectedly good i cant wait to see peoples reactions those who have trashed it since the first trailer 
Jul 11 2016,positive,i loved the originals after the whole shebang that this movie was horrid i went to a preview and was surprised that it wasnt half as bad in fact it was funny and full of nods to the old ones including cameos of most of the stars that are still around you need to stay until the very end of the credits as otherwise you will miss a big deal of laughs and the afore mentioned cameos i would say dont read the reviews  buy a ticket have a laugh or two and make up your own mind ps it is about 2 hours long  but worth giving it a shot old style 80s summer movie silly feeling that has been missing for a while
Jul 11 2016,negative,this was actually worse than travoltas battlefield earth give me my 15 hours back
Jul 11 2016,negative,so  certified fresh officially means nothing
Jul 11 2016,negative,saw a screener of this film the jokes fall flat most of the times special effects just look cheesy i just dont get what they were trying to do here it just doesnt work i had high hopes for this with mccarthy and wiig in the cast but to no avail this is a major disappointment
Jul 11 2016,positive,was entertaining   funniest scenes were in trailers  goofy scenes   some eye candy  nothing special so gave it 3 12  stay for post credit scenes
Jul 11 2016,positive,making a cover of a legendary 80s comedy classic is an ambitious task changing the main ingredient of what made this classic an unforgettable movie is pretty much an audacious move yet the remake of ghostbusters succeeds to surprise the initially negative expectations and to deliver a decently good entertainment even if it cannot match the level of the original chaotic funny and nicely balancing between modernity and the 80s paul feigs remake overcomes its week story and provides a passable comedy experience even if you are not a fan of the original movie    abby melissa mccarthy and erin kristen wiig are two estranged friends and scientists who start working together after erin loses her position as an associated professor at a prestigious college the pickup from where their relationship turned soar in the past namely a research on the paranormal with not much options left the ydecide to startup a business as ghostbusters joined by the weirdo jillian kat mckinnon only to get involved pretty soon in a mission to save the world  the first and most important question for everyone prior to seeing the movie especially if you have seen the original is does the female cast manage to deliver the same level or performance and funny moments as the original male cast the answer is pretty positive mccarthy wiig and mckinnon are fresh in their own way while the ridiculous support of chris hemsworth adds up moments of sweet reference though genderreversed to the original movie the presence of some of the old ghostbusters participants as bill murray dan aykroyd and sigourney weaver add up another layer of nice connection to the original of course the magnetic performance of murray is dearly missed but the hyperactive and loud mccarthy is capable to deliver decent amounts of fun  where the paul feigs movie fails to match the original is the story and the effects back then in the 80s the effects used were quite impressive bud unfortunately this time you could feel as if they fail to impress despite the effort to make them a central part of the movie the second minor issue is the story it is true that the first movie was not something special either but the remake feels just a bit more artificial than its predecessor  nevertheless considering the initial low expectations and dissatisfied reaction from casting ladies for the roles the 2016 ghostbusters is a nicely surprising and decently entertaining supernatural comedyhorror it will not reach the cult status of the original but it is surely a good choice for an evening of home cinema entertainment
Jul 11 2016,negative,terrible story with no sense
Jul 11 2016,negative,do not support this garbageworst cinema experience i can rememberlaughably bad film
Jul 11 2016,positive,fun fast scary great action scenes but the ending just fails to be engaging enough
Jul 11 2016,negative,i went in this trying to be optimistic and i will say this movie is an absolute abomination and insult to the original from top to bottom the script is horrible the lame fart jokes take away from the class the original one had the ghosts look more like disneys haunted mansion than ghostbusters i can go on and on but theres absolutely no need if you find this movie entertaining than that says more about your lack of good taste then how good this movie is this movie is absolute garbage even if you stripped everything away from it that resembles ghostbusters this movie is still garbage the best part was leslie jones and she was just stereotyped through the whole movie you can see in bill murrays roll that he was not impressed with this movie and that he was just there going through the motions dan aykroyd looked just happy that something ghostbusters is being made i guarantee if you get any of these guys away from the camera away from the recorder and ask them theyre opinion i guarantee you itll be the same as mine i will say i will never watch this movie again
Jul 11 2016,negative,terrible terrible terrible its a movie that just bashes men for 90 minutes in the hope people will find it funny    lots of stockpuppet feminist accounts are giving this 5 stars but even they know the movie is bad
Jul 11 2016,positive,ignore the sexist basement nerd haters this is truly funny reimagining that could easily stand on its own without any knowledge of the previous films  hemsworth nearly steals the show but the whole cast are clearly having a ball
Jul 10 2016,negative,this movie falls flat on everything every joke is a cringe every single line of leslie jones is your generic aw hell nah or mmmhmmmm gurl the entire cast is lacking chemistry the preformances are all forced all of the men in this movie are made into either idiots or jerks and it says screw the men and original fans basically every other line of the film    the thing that made the original movie work is how they played it seriously the actors played it like this was a serious thing even when the ridiculous was happening this movie has it where they are making sure you know they are in a movie it comes off much like batman and robin they play it so over the top and badly that its not immersive speaking of immersive the effects wouldnt pass in the 90s in the second half of the film    there was a review embargo for a reason this movie sucks this movie is a slap in the face to men women minorities and the fans of the original movies do not go see this movie its beyond bad id rather go watch foodfight again the animation is better there    they reference so many movies yet none are good i mean at one point hemsworth makes a peter pan joke flies up in the peter pan pose as hes showered in glitter and a sounds plays ugh    theres a 20 second scenemaybe longer where they just say the cats out of the bag and the other one goes well its out now how do we get it in its aweful
Jul 10 2016,positive,it was ok the lines were great but performance was week mr hemsworth was the worst sorry
Jul 10 2016,positive,a solid movie if youre a real ghostbusters fan it is akin more to the cartoon than the original movies which is not necessarily a bad thing i love ghostbusters 2 as much as the original and i still think this movie is slightly better its a fun original story with tons of humor which depending on your sense of humor may not be for you dont expect the style or humor of the originals and you might actually enjoy yourself
Jul 10 2016,negative,not scary not funny story line is cliche and poorly executed
Jul 10 2016,positive,cutting 10 or 15 minutes would have made it even better but its an enjoyable film
Jul 10 2016,positive,didnt have an issue with a remake didnt have an issue with a female cast all i cared was if it was a good movie to watch  it was recommended
Jul 10 2016,positive,wow ghostbusters is brilliant hilarious and punching the air exhilarating definitely see it on the big screen
Jul 10 2016,negative,scoobydoo 3 gets a star just cause i love nyc
Jul 10 2016,neutral,mixed feelings about this movie
Jul 10 2016,negative,just as i thought bad movie with poor acting and another movie that made men look stupid wait for netflix or torrent and save your money
Jul 10 2016,negative,when considering rebootsremakes you should consider 1 does it add anything new to the franchise 2 does it expand on the universe in any meaningful way and 3 does it improve upon or fix something lacking in the original story     well ghostbusters 2016 rehashes old territory with a gender swap not really original  it is a hard reset of the franchise and considering gb 1984 was a game changer  the new version is widely held as not being as good as the original even if half of the top critics rate it as wildly amazing to passable the other half panning it of course    you would absolutely be justified waiting for netflix to see it based on the reviews we have seen so far  but i will be seeing it with a fandango gift card as sony doesnt deserve my money  so if the film is at least decent i will amend this review      make me a believer sony
Jul 10 2016,positive,i loved it its a perfect blend of new with lots of nods to the old
Jul 10 2016,negative,shitty movie dont waste your money
Jul 10 2016,negative,yes it really is that bad  wait for it to be on netflix in a month or 2 if you really want to see the film  visual effects look like plastic and the main problem is that the 4 leads just arent that funny  they are trying to be really hard to be funny which is the problem the original cast took paranormal activity super serious which is why they were funny in the first place
Jul 10 2016,positive,watched the premier in hollywood and want to watch it again
Jul 10 2016,negative,aborts everything that make the original ghostbusters great
Jul 10 2016,negative,the resen im giving this movie 1 star is because paul fig turn the ghostbusters reboot  into feministgirlpowerracsiest  movie and that is why i gave it 1 star and i wont be seeing it
Jul 10 2016,negative,not worth the price of admission even with a free ticket
Jul 10 2016,negative,compared to the original ghostbusters falls flat in about every aspect character design is stereotypical the plot is like a bad rehash of the original and the comedy simply falls flat over and over and over again    while sony took a brave move in attempting an all female ghostbuster team they failed to mention that in doing so amy pascal and paul feig would then make every male in the movie incompetent lazy or stupid     the original cast of the first ghostbusters is present but not in any of their beloved roles rather they seemed to have been strong armed to be inserted into roles that have absolutely no connection with their previous roles and simply serve to break up the monotony of the tone deaf jokes and chemistrylacking female leads     while the villain does alright the rehash plot device of the original ghostbusters is even worse here as while feigs ghostbusters has been bashing males throughout this entire film they proceed to end the final boss by shooting it in the genitals as if this is somehow a statement for feminism or redemption for women it is not     overall this movie fails to show the slightest respect for the original the theme has also been altered in a very unfortunate manner and the result is simply atrocious     do yourself a favor avoid this movie and just go read the 30 year old original and sequel instead
Jul 10 2016,positive,first things first its not as good as the original  however if you dont try to put it in the same league as the 84 flick there is a highly engaging fun movie to be had here    kate mckinnon and chris hemsworth stole the show and they were by far the funniest characters  speaking of funny the comedy is very different from the original  a lot less one lines and witty banter a whole lot of slapstick and gags  its funny just a different kind of funny    the main cast works very well together and each of them bring some thing different to the table  i found all of them to be likable and performed their role well    my main knocks against the film are the weak villain in the form of rowan and the mayor who is pretty weak  also not a fan of the new ecto1 it pales in comparison to the original    however the new gear which i didnt like when i saw the pictures first pop up online actually looks pretty good in action  wasnt a big fan of the sidearms and the action sequence with them but it was okay    some people have knocked the effects i actually enjoyed them and thought they added a lot of the ghosts  there were also a few genuinely scary scenes maybe even more so than the original      overall ghostbusters answer the call works its funny as far as reboots goes ive seen a lot worse  its not force awakens or jurassic world good but its definitely not star trek bad  i give it 35 stars out of 5
Jul 10 2016,positive,i just saw it it was awesome i might like it even better than the old movies this film almost made me cry and the post credits scene amazing definetly glad i supported this movie from the start paul feig once again delivers a great and entertaining movie hope it gets a sequel
Jul 10 2016,negative,wow i wanted to be a ghost myself half way through this mess
Jul 10 2016,negative,just completely ruined everything hope this movie fucking flops
Jul 10 2016,neutral,fun but not special it did not do a disservice to the franchise honestly if you were going to have the original cast show up then let them show up it would have been cool if there was a hint that something had gone down in the past or even a found device in the station there was no need to make it overdone but there was also no need for a complete reboot the ladies themselves were ok i think jones actually was the best mckinnon became totally obnoxious by the end of the 2nd act her antics were actually a distraction and it took away from the movie as good summer entertainment it is fine my kids saw it and they enjoyed it there may be a few scary spots for those under 13
Jul 10 2016,positive,some places try to hard to either force it to be like the 1984 version or does a great job at it the ending was pretty much predicable in some sense and could have been done better job of making the team have a legacy if a 2nd one follows
Jul 10 2016,positive,got to see it last night at the world premier as a long time ghostbuster fan i was wary but im glad i gave it a chance i loved the film it took about 10 min to find its stride and then takes off really worth seeing in 3d it was a fun take on the franchise and i plan to see it several more times
Jul 10 2016,neutral,i was hoping for a bit more funny but i definitely appreciate a femaleled action comedy
Jul 10 2016,negative,who on earth would ever want to see this terrible monstrosity of a film absolute garbage
Jul 10 2016,negative,dont waste your money on this
Jul 10 2016,negative,that was not ghostbusters that was what everpaul want it to be but not ghostbusters it was the robot busters
Jul 10 2016,positive,it was a fun film if youre looking for a few laughs with some cool action this is a solid choice for an evening at the theater
Jul 10 2016,negative,pales in comparison to the original
Jul 10 2016,positive,lots of action more ghostbusting than the first two its definitely not better than the original
Jul 10 2016,positive,the pacing is a tad faster than i would like i wish there had been more time to develop characters other than that this is a great way to breath life into the franchise     its funny it has heart and is enjoyable to watch
Jul 10 2016,negative,if you want to see an unoriginal script which is just a remake of the first film with the only difference is that its a female cast and nothing else creative going on please queue to watch this was bored by the level of predictability and failed stereotype jokes
Jul 10 2016,positive,this movie was surprisingly better than i thought  it doesnt try to be the original while at the same time somewhat respecting the source material  overall its fun actionadventure anyone can enjoy im looking forward to a sequel
Jul 10 2016,negative,worst movie ever original much better this is just a ripoff of the name fk feminism
Jul 10 2016,negative,while visually pretty appealing the movie as a whole falls flat having a few laughs towards the beginning the film just does not live up to the giant that is the original the story was weak and the villain is even weaker than the story i can see the appeal that some fans will have but i can safely say that to me paul feig has delivered a subpar adaptation of an 80s classic kate mckinnon felt like she was just there to make weird faces and voices without delivering any real comedy to the film chris hemsworth was used poorly and had no chemistry with the other cast members the other three played well together but were still handcuffed to a poor script and a poor directing effort by feig all in all this is a forgettable movie that has me crying out who thought this was a good idea
Jul 10 2016,negative,this has to be the biggest joke every played on the fans this movie is utter garbage from start to finish none of the jokes work there is zero chemistry between the actors and the cgi was pure shit paul feig should never work in hollywood again after this disaster
Jul 10 2016,positive,i saw a prescreening earlier this week and laughed a lot during the movie despite the fact that chris hemsworth might have been the character that made me laugh the most and the fact that the third act fell apart a bit i still thought this movie was great id definitely see it again
Jul 10 2016,negative,please do not listen to any of these politically correct shill reviewers im a gender egalitarian and im all for women rights but this ghostbusters movie is anything but equal this ghostbusters trash on men so much like holy hell chris hemsworth is the only main male guy and hes a dunce hes useless and he is constantly harrassed by the women about his looks and brains its disgusting to see this double standard exist f this movie f paul feig the cgi is garbage kate mckinnon is great christ gemsworth is great in a bad role leslie jones is portraying a racist and stereotypical black woman no different than the crap we saw a hundred times on snl its all the talent she has  i cant vent enough about how much this movie sucked and how racist clicheridden disgusting disrespectful and just downright unjust to men and women it is sorry i had to vent honestly the worst movie ive ever gone to see im ashamed i went to an early premiere and funded this turd i am ashamed at the film industry for producing this piece of crap  and i am ashamed at these wanna be social justice warriors and politically correct reviewers who are too afraid to voice their real opinions or are being paid by sony to say something positive which has happened before this is a disgrace do not support this movie my apologies for doing so just wait and pirate it to be let down  its not helping women or men i dont care that its an all female lead cast but dont go bashing guys the whole time and f  king creating stereotypes of men and women youre not helping the situation youre making it worse making crap like this
Jul 10 2016,positive,extremely fun and had me smiling like an idiot throughout
Jul 10 2016,negative,they clearly didnt understand what made the original funny  the humor was just wrong  why would you ruin a good movie with this kind of junk
Jul 10 2016,negative,not going to see this garbage because of the comments of the cast and crew
Jul 10 2016,negative,disappointed with the script and lazy cgi
Jul 10 2016,negative,avoided the clash of the titans reboot  same with poltergeist remake  and psycho remake  will be avoiding this trash along with wargames the birds and time bandits remakes  no remakereboot of a very good and beloved film to me will ever see one more cent of my hardearned money  this dumpsterfire falls right into that category
Jul 10 2016,positive,i have to say i was pretty excited seeing this movieand its everything i hoped for i was worried about the scary content but the laughter dancing and music really diminished the scare level for me all of the women were superb kate mckinnon is a star i expect to see more from her in the future the effects i went to the 3d version really come at you the credits at the end are spectacular dont listen to the bullies and bashersthis is one ride i will see over and over againghostbusters
Jul 10 2016,negative,movie critics are useless
Jul 10 2016,positive,sooo funny whole theater was laughing throughout the whole thing
Jul 10 2016,negative,theres no way in hell im going to see this movie
Jul 10 2016,negative,the movie ends by them shooting the ghost on his privates my eyes rolled so far into the back of my head that i think im blind
Jul 10 2016,negative,bit overly sexist for my taste
Jul 10 2016,positive,a delightful success the 2016 ghostbusters rises above its tedious detractors to show its true worth as a warm and lively comedy treat its leading ladies are superb it mixes admittedly broad humour with a surprising dedication to wordplay and excellentlysetup jokes and its heart is most definitely in the right place if it pays a little too much homage to the original and has an underwhelming villain this is more then compensated for by those whom the movie is really concerned with its four original lead characters its director is clearly best at comedy but that is perfectly fitting as this is more of a direct comedy then the original deserves success
Jul 10 2016,positive,the acting can be cringeworthy at times but the movie makes up for it with funny moments and nostalgic moments
Jul 10 2016,positive,i know everyone raved about the allfemale cast but chris hemsworth was my favorite followed closely by kate mckinnon
Jul 10 2016,negative,this movie is the worst pile of garbage ive ever ever seen these critics must have been paid a lot to promote this crap
Jul 10 2016,negative,will not see or buy this sony reboot
Jul 10 2016,positive,after months of the most hate i have ever seen thrust upon a movie did it deserve it not at all even if it is not as great or as groundbreaking as the original it still was a lot of fun it wasnt the funniest i was chuckling through most of it but rarely laughing hard but to me there are two types of good comedies those that make you laugh hard airplane blazing saddles ect and those that are just a ton of fun the cornetto trilogy men in black ect this definitely comes closer to the latter category but as i said it is not great but it comes close the ghost designs didnt get interesting until the end and the end was a lot of fun especially with the big ghost they had to fight without spoiling anything it is as good as the stay puff marshmallow man and the statue of liberty i just realized ghostbusters the original kind of cemented my favorite subgenre of comedy the over the top action camp com and this is another almost great addition to it 7510
Jul 10 2016,positive,i was prepared to dislike this movie i loved the original and despise reboots but i am happy to say i actually enjoyed it  cast does a great job even if the villain is pretty meh there a definitely some cringeworthy cornball moments the movie spends too much time paying homage to the original and not enough time innovating  all and all harmless fun worth the trip for the wantons
Jul 10 2016,positive,outstanding movie hilarious  solid performances all around perfect blend of comedy scares  action paul feig did a great job directing the wonderfully talented cast it is so much fun  so worth seeing multiple times  im a huge fan of the originals but i laughed so much more with this 1 its definitely a different animal than the originals to compare this to the originals is like comparing a particle physicist to a marine biologist sure theyre both scientists but theyre different in pretty much every other aspect
Jul 10 2016,positive,ghostbusters was a lot more funny than i thought it would be
Jul 10 2016,negative,this movie was suppose to be a reboot of the original ghostbusters that we all know and love however they were so focused on making an all woman team they forgot to make a ghostbusters movie leslie jones is a great comedian and it bothered me that not only was her dialogue written as a stereotypical black woman in the original ghostbusters movie ernie hudson was my favorite character and what made him even more special was that they didnt care that he was black it was a team not four white dudes and a black guy like it is in this movie just four and theyre women
Jul 10 2016,negative,worthless reboot full of cunts
Jul 10 2016,positive,an amazing take on the 80s classic its not a copy with a gender swap so fanboys calm down its a well written fun time with laughs and a shock here and there i just wish they spent some time on the villains backstory its nice to see the franchise an breathe new life with paul fieg time to grow up and embrace the new ghostbusters they bust ghosts and guts with laughs
Jul 10 2016,negative,2016s ghostbuster is almost impressively bad the jokes are all but exclusively one liners even seth macfarlane  would be ashamed of while the women are clearly talented this film does nothing to help any of their careers instead showing off all of their flaws the character of kevin is insultingly dumb lacking any charm the editing is so poorly done the timeframe is unclear and the love of gadgets created to bust ghosts come across less impressive and felt like a toy advertisement lacking the whit and charm of the original ghostbusters 2016 is yet another pointless remake
Jul 10 2016,negative,super lame i didnt laugh at anything in this movie not to mention this is a really ugly cast thats alot of ugly to sit through
Jul 10 2016,positive,i loved it all of the women were very funny but kate mckinnon stole the show
Jul 10 2016,negative,unnecessary remake took the intelligence out of ghostbusters proton packs kill ghosts now sigh
Jul 10 2016,neutral,paul feig manages to bounce back at the frosty reception of the ghostbusters trailers with a fairly positively mediocre reboot of a 1984 comedy masterpiece this latest installment of the ghostbusters franchise does however have some extremely cheesy and silly acting that came from mainly the female lineup of the ghostbusters themselves while watching this film i noticed that one of them was trying way too hard to the point where it wasnt that amusing this actress was kate mckinnon she was trying to be cartoonish and quite frankly it didnt work onscreen overall 2016s ghostbusters isnt terrible it isnt amazing its just okay ghostbusters  255 stars
Jul 10 2016,negative,the jokes were childish and pedestrian chris hemsworths character was offensive in the sense that i was expected to find that funny oh he out the phone in the fish tank ha ha  this movie will be forgotten
Jul 10 2016,negative,although i was optimistic about this film it dissatisfied my feels about it with cartoony female characters that are now the new ghostbusters they must protect the city by weird cgi ghost and a dorky villian alot of media is saying fans dont like the reboot because the ghostbusters are all females thats not the point its the weak humor put in this film that makes it soooo annoying did i say that every character in this movie is a stereotype thank you mr feige for making one of my childhood movies get a forgettable reboot
Jul 10 2016,negative,an agenda pushing overtly sexist spoofy genderswap typical paul feig but instead of an original he did it to ghostbusters shame on sony for not taking ghostbusters in an inclusive direction and instead making what amounts to a girl version     12 star
Jul 10 2016,positive,ghostbusters is a fresh take on one of the most beloved comedies of all time but still stays true to the original the acting is good from all involved kate mckinnon steals every scene shes in as does chris hemsworth overall this movie is a bunch of fun from start to finish
Jul 10 2016,negative,this movie was straight garbage
Jul 10 2016,negative,is the ghostbusters remake any good smart or as funny as the original far from it and standing on its on this is far from a good film and is a meandering unfunny and cringingly awkward flick which will hopefully be quickly forgotten in time its true what they say the best bits are in the trailer and when the trailer is bad the movie can only be worse
Jul 10 2016,positive,ghostbusters 2016 is not the original and its not trying to be from very early on in the film it is clear that the cast and crew were going for a different tone and approach and for the most part they nailed it this film really shines when the actors are given the most room to breathe both mckinnon and hemsworth commit fully to their absurd characters and they are incredibly fun to watch on screen   the good  the main cast is at the top of their game  great special effects  genuinely threatening ghosts  great actionoriented fourth act    the bad  the pacing and editing in the first act detracts overall from the film  lackluster supporting cast and ultimately forgettable big bad    verdict  unless you are one of the folks out there that are totally opposed to this new take on the beloved franchise you will find the new ghostbusters to be a fun revamp of the series although it does not quite live up to the originals both hardcore fans and casual moviegoers should be able to appreciate ghostbusters
Jul 10 2016,negative,disappointed at best
Jul 10 2016,negative,i wanted to like it but this film is little more than a minstrel show leslie jones character is a especially in poor taste considering the stereotypical portrayal of people of color in other media
Jul 10 2016,positive,the internet and ghostbros are all wrong  this movie is amazing fun and the start of something bigger  trying to compare anything to the original is a cop out  this movie does a great job in tribute to the original while at the same time standing alone  nothing will beat the classic but this is a good start to the reboot of the franchise   go see ghostbusters
Jul 10 2016,negative,had high hopes for the film as i love melissa mccarthy and kirsten wig leslie jones and kate mckinnon ive not really seen   i felt there was a real lack of chemistry between the characters the storyline made very little sense and the cameos were disappointing   there was no real thought put into making this film
Jul 10 2016,negative,should have continued the venkman universe even without all characters alive and even introducing the same women preferably with a director who takes danger somewhat seriously and one who doesnt disparage the audience it might have made another 150 million domestic if they respected the fans instead we get a light show that prides itself on gadgets and a moreisbetter philosophy about throwers  feig didnt want technology handed to the new crew but proper passing of the torch was good enough for creed or force awakens even if the women have funny moments it isnt worth losing what future ghost corps films could have been too dumb
Jul 10 2016,positive,well i wasnt expecting to enjoy this as much as i did with the original being one of my favourite films i wasnt expecting to like this much because generally speaking i hate reboots but paul feig made this a film that doesnt try to be the original and trys to be something new and he succeeds the cast were honestly great i loved kate mckinnon and chris hemsworth the most the 3d was the best 3d ive seen since avatar the 3d literally goes outside of the aspect ratio the film had very spooky scenes as well which i was not expecting one bit also the cameos apart from dan aykroyds which was spoilt in a tv spot were genuinely great my favourite being ernie hudsons the film does have flaws though with some jokes falling flat and just being unfunny and some scenes that feel forced the dialogue isnt the greatest but that doesnt knock off to many points for me on the last note the new equipment was kinda cool but a few things were quite pointless eg the proton bomb not a big fan of how they changed the pke meter either but overall despite the flaws ghostbusters 2016 is a fun entertaining time and everyone should see it
Jul 10 2016,negative,saw the screening in la this film sucks it is worse then i though dont go see it its not worth any form of money i wont be getting this film or see this in theaters this movie is so bad that it made adam sandlers pixels look like oscar material
Jul 10 2016,positive,i new approach for a new era ghostbusters is charming clever and very well executed once more the director paul feig proves to be one of the most versatile directors of this generation and the ensemble cast with melissa mccarthy kristen wiig kate mckinnon and leslie jones are excellent in her respectives roles  45
Jul 10 2016,negative,uninspired and unfunny  the call backs to the original just remind you how subpar this movie is  i was hoping for at least a passable effort but was left disappointed
Jul 10 2016,negative,ruined my childhood  not funny  sad
Jul 10 2016,negative,this film failed to spook me
Jul 10 2016,positive,saw a prescreening and loved it i laughed i had tears of joy  pride lots of nods to real ghost heads  gb cosplayers cameos were awesome lots of yess yes this happened yes they said this yes clever nod etc  great action scenes great tech  gadgetsdamned near perfect  going again tomorrow for imax
Jul 10 2016,negative,my wifes son duquan was very eager to watch this movie having loved the original ones i was more than happy to take him big mistake    have you ever seen the room by tommy wiseau this movie seems like it was written by him the plot is disjointed the dialogue is terrible dont get me started on the acting its like they were reading their lines off of cue cards having never even read through the script nothing about it was funny duquan was a big fan of the thick white bch i believe in reference to melissa mccarthy    this movie might become a cult classic in the same vein as the room or plan 9 from outer space but if youre hoping for it to live up to the originals i would pass
Jul 10 2016,negative,ghostbusters2016 was an enjoyable film likeable characters that had impeccable chemistry with one another comedy that was mostly worked for me fun action sequences that featured inventive ghostbusting technology only problems i encountered were     poorly written villain   similar plot to the original  references and cameos to the original films were forced and awkward  a lot more focus on humour rather than story or characters   610
Jul 10 2016,negative,this movie brings shame to the ghostbusters name this reboot was absolutely unnecessary nothing more then a cash grab all of the supporters that are calling the haters sexist make them seem like complete hypocrites after seeing the movie all of the comedy is forced and not funny unlike the original 2 most of the actors are loud and annoying and make the movie unbearable to watch this movie is nowhere near a kid friendly movie then what they have intended and advertised it to be with all the sex and racial jokes and is an absolute fail when trying to pass the torch to the next generation is it too much just to go to your local walmart and buy the original movie on dvd or something sony and hollywood are screwing themselves over with making these reboots because no one there is original enough to make something new
Jul 10 2016,negative,well the jokes dont land the dialogue and story are just terrible the characters are all just  exaggerated clichã cs and stereotypes the villain is barely even a character at all the cgi ghosts who seemed to be made more comical than scary  were by far the worst of all just garbage dont be pressured into saying this is a good movie
Jul 10 2016,negative,i dont even want to give this crap half a star dont waste the money
Jul 10 2016,negative,this film is full of antimale propaganda where every male character is either a socially inept jerk or a complete idiot also they felt the need to include a stereotypical load black woman how anyone can consider this film progressive is laughable save your money folks
Jul 10 2016,negative,not only is this adaptation of ghostbusters full of horrific cliche snl style comedy but i now am forced to agree with millions of others who classified the special effects as scooby doo quality  it becomes overwhelmingly clear that shoving some of the beloved cast of the original two films into this mess with if i may be blundt cameos that make no sense quickly gives a vibe that even having the original cast appear was nothing more than a rushed afterthought to beg fans to support the tragedy that is this movie     as for direction goes paul feig succeeds in only one thing  proving that he cares absolutely nothing about the first two ghostbusters filmsnor the hardcore fans  its as if hes taken the entire franchise dumped every part out on the ground like an old box of legosand then simply walks away from it like it never existed    horrible jokes horrible story horrible cast  speaking of whichif it werent enough that mccarthy does not feel connected to the other cast members and continues to puke out some of the worst acting i use that term loosely ever put on the silver screen the real shame lies within leslie jones jones is without a doubt one of the weakest links and worst parts of whats shamefully being called ghostbusters   her performance is embarrassing to watch on every level and leaves you exiting the theater wishing sony had paid you to sit through the movie        i wont even waste time on feigs ecto1  lets just say that all of the haters comments about how idiotic it lookswere absolutely on point      i cant imagine this honest review will be allowed to show for long so i will be taking steps to ensure as many people see it as possible    as a ghostbusters fan first and foremost i can say this film is nothing more than a poorly throwntogether tool to put money into aykroyd and feigs pockets  and as someone who has tried to keep an open mind and has a few personal connections to the original films even i can not be bought  any serious fan of ghostbustersshould not waste their time or money on this
Jul 10 2016,negative,the most unimaginative and unnecessary reboot ever made
Jul 10 2016,negative,theres a tree on my house
Jul 10 2016,positive,a  solid  good movie that  could have been better
Jul 10 2016,negative,garbage has a new name
Jul 10 2016,positive,i have just attended the uk media premiere of the ghostbusters reboot overall i would say it isnt an essential watch but there is some funny lines in the film with it having quite a comedic tone but is as cheesy as a packet of cheetos a lot of the time the special effects  and camera shots our fairly average and what youd expect from the film also there are some interesting references from the original film that can be fun to spot out throughout the film in conclusion i would give it a 5 or 6 out of 10 simply because with it been such a high budget film it could have been better having seeing the film early i believe there will be mixed opinions with some people enjoying the fun aspects and some people labelling the film corny
Jul 10 2016,negative,i saw it and waste of money forgettable and passable
Jul 10 2016,positive,i dont understand why the audience score is so low for this movie its a very silly film that does a great job with bringing a new tone and style to the franchise  a great reboot for a film its the best rebootremake since evil dead
Jul 10 2016,positive,i enjoyed it ill take the original any day though but it has its problems    jokes were forcefully thrown at almost every opportunity    the characters needed a lot more development i seriously liked leslie jones character the most despite being underdeveloped as well  relied on onedimensional stereotypes    chris hemsworths character was aggravating seriously why would you make him so cartoonishly idioitic    the plot needed a bit more work the animated series fanboy in me wishes they would have used samhain for this movie if they wanted to use the ghostly leader  invasion idea if youve watched the animated series youll know who that is     the villain was a joke i admired however how beautifully they animated the logo ghost form he takes in 2d first  how amazingly well rendered his giant form is which is not easy to do given how cartoony it was  some loser noname played by some actor no one really cares about trying to take over the world because society calls him a freak and rightfully so isnt the best way to create a villain again my fanboy wanted samhain because he would have been more appropriate as well as different for this type of plot but the villain here was a joke to out it nicely    other than that i still enjoyed it especially the soundtrack some of the jokes were funny  the story stands on its own the most impressive parts of the film were the action sequences as that was the highlights of the movie as well as the actresses he script indeed needed work but it wasnt too terrible    i do agree with someone who said that it would have been best to create a third sequel where the original guys actually want to retire  end up hiring the new girls with it eventually leading it into a new series hopefully the sequel replaces the director as much as i like feig    but as is typical with the internet when the word remake reboot or readaption there is a difference between them is mentioned or even a new adaption of some booktvcomic the internets biggest idiots flood right in  start flipping their shit over it  start whining over how holleewoodz iz nut originalz aneemooorone11111eleven because hollywood certainly wasnt doing that since the beginning of fucking cinema so because of this adrenaline of stupid rushes into their brain they go in  hate whatever it is with that bias rushing through in which of course you wont enjoy it makes me feel good that im one of the few who actually has an open mind in cinema  will watch a movie  hatelike it based on whether its any good or not  whether its a remake or not hell i despised that poltergeist remake let that sink in take into mind i didnt even say you had to like this movie
Jul 10 2016,negative,i was really looking forward to this movie it was a really big letdown
Jul 10 2016,negative,its trying to hard to be like the old one
Jul 10 2016,positive,i loved the original ghostbusters movies and so was very keen to see this somewhat disappointing trailers had me lower my expectations but the movie comfortably exceeded them i was grinning through the entire thing im very keen to see the cast return for a sequel
Jul 10 2016,negative,worst movie of the summer
Jul 10 2016,positive,ghostbusters is a funny film that you can take a group of friends to see and have a lot of fun at the theater there are some pretty cool easter eggs in the movie some are better than others but there is a lot to like about this film all the actors are great but the one who stood out the most was chris hemsworth he can do some amazing comedy and aside from his thor roll that should be all he does top notch on his part the ghost at the beginning of the film are beautiful filled with so much color and are just wonderful to look at ive seen this film twice and i cant wait to go back if you want fun and funny with a great cast this is a movie that can make you happy
Jul 10 2016,negative,horrible bossesactorled waffle ghostbusters with vaginas is naff nothing to do with vaginas its just not funny mind you never liked the original either with willies so its a fair match special effects are very good but theres also a toecurling absence of logic cant believe i sat through it
Jul 10 2016,negative,why remake an iconic and classic film from the ground up this could have been all men all women or all water buffalo but remaking an iconic classic that still holds the test of time today is just a horrid idea from the get go     this new film has none of the sly dry humor tone wit or charm that made the original a beloved classic all we get is extreme slapstick poop jokes fart jokes vomit jokes and shooting ghosts in the genital jokes that are not only crude and unfunny but have zero place in the ghostbusters franchise i was really hoping i was just having a nightmare but i will never be able to scrub some of the garbage on screen from my head not only is it more sexist than the studio and creative talents were towards all the naysayers its also plays the race card as well really in a ghostbusters movie absolutely dreadful from start to finish    my favorite film of alltime is now tainted in that it has to reside in history with a remake of the same exact name truly a sad time for ghostbusters fans
Jul 10 2016,positive,a lot of people want this movie to be a lot of things but at its core ghostbusters 2016 is more concerned with being hilarious through and through this is a true ghostbusters film where the characters and their rapport draw you in the ghost can scare you  see it in imax 3d if you can it was incredible and overall will just make you feel good leaving the theatre
Jul 10 2016,negative,this movie fucking sucks
Jul 10 2016,positive,if you like melissa mccarthy you will enjoy the humour in this film great cast and enjoyed the cgi on the most part people hating on it just from a trailer need to chiiilllllllll
Jul 10 2016,negative,bad movie  bad jokes bad acting there should be a law that prohibits shitty remakes
Jul 10 2016,negative,was invited to an advanced screening by a friend who had tickets probably shouldnt have even wasted my time on a free movie the disappointment in the theater was palpable  mostly sighs and moans at some pretty cringeworthy humor it did have a few chuckles  like when erin wiig meets kevin helmsworth there were little bits of mannerisms  subtle cues that came off great and genuine but any good will that is earned by these moments is derailed by patty jones  in what is almost blacksplotation or mccarthy shooting a giant ghostbusters logo in the crotch and then dry humping her proton gun the humor falls mostly flat the plot is a mess and the soundtrack atrocious as big of a fan as i am of wiig mckinnon and even some of feigs earlier work in the end this feels like another souless hollywood cash grab
Jul 10 2016,negative,not funny not one good joke and the story was just bad
Jul 10 2016,positive,enjoyed every second the haters and crybabies can suck my dick
Jul 10 2016,negative,the movie is a complete disaster the jokes arent funny the cgi is terrible still scratching my head as to why they made a reboot when no one wanted one dont waste your time or money watching this pile of crap film
Jul 10 2016,positive,thoroughly enjoyed the movie see it in imax 3d if you can  i think that tech was made for ghosts really pleased with how the movie turned out
Jul 10 2016,positive,the original is the original and its always difficult to beat the innovators this movie does a tremendous job of standing alone and standing up to the original with great lines character development props every fan watching saying thats going to be a pain to build and effects that may seem overused yet fit in with the arc great nods to the original and a wonderful use of the cast had fans cheering throughout  will be seeing this one again
Jul 10 2016,negative,this movie is so beyond bad its ridiculous its not the all women cast its just so unfunny and uninspired youre run of the mill jokes and plotting with not even a dash of creativity in the story it takes the ghostbuster name and drags it through the mud when these actors could have just made their own movie out of something else no competent person can actually sit through this whole movie and actually say that it was good praying to my lucky stars that theyre isnt a sequel but thats unlikely given the desperate state of hollywood franchises this movie is a skid mark
Jul 10 2016,negative,i took my wifes son and daughter to see this movie hoping to relive my memories of the first two ghostbusters films unfortunately very disappointing the jokes are very lame the all female cast never seemed to be sold on their rolls and the dialogue is clumsy and awkward for the most part avoid this trainwreck
Jul 10 2016,negative,this movie is utter garbage poorly written unfunny dialogue coupled with an underwhelming finale anyone giving this a good review should be looked at with suspicion
Jul 10 2016,positive,very funny movie all my worries are left behind me
Jul 10 2016,positive,ghostbusters is a wellmade film with a smart cast and a good director is not the movie of the year but pleasantly surprised with a film that likes the current generation
Jul 10 2016,negative,amongst all the remakes that have emerged in the last 20 years  ghostbusters stands out as being the one that missed the mark the most  the comedy falls flat the directing is atrocious the special effects were outdated in 1992 and the score is lazy and uninspired  the only upside to this movie is its cast that will hopefully go on to do better projects with much better directors and stories
Jul 10 2016,positive,not as good as the original but thats not a bad thing
Jul 10 2016,negative,is it just me or is leslie jones not able to talk without moving her head
Jul 10 2016,negative,if you want a movie focused on fauxgirl power and manbashing this is the movie for you  paul fieg is at his worst and melissa mccarthy her unfunniest in a film that entirely misses the point of the original or the franchise structurally and thematically with massive plotholes unfunny jokes and not only the misandry many expected from such a film given the record of those on it every guy is unjustly an idiot or asshole which is not a balanced way to present such in a movie that many see as a progressive step forward into a world where ones gender should not matter but reducing the female roles to little more than stereotypes with sexist and racist tinges to them  the original movies and spinoff material didnt care about your age race background or gender anyone could be a ghostbuster and thats what many wanted to see out of this  here its the girls thing to exclusion of all others  its a womens movie thats insutling to men women and fandom  they beat the boss by shooting him in the dick  that is crass and easily symbolic of wanting to kick in the dick of the patriarchy but they chose the wrong target  as the underlying joke to the rest of the franchise isnt about any form of elitism but theyre in over their head in a job thats comparable to specialized bluecollar work not unlike pest control whereas here its we can do this we can be better than everyone because we do this and we have all the answers so well prove ourselves right in an elitist manner  chris hemsworth is easily the funniest thing in the film but most of that is entirely unintentional comedy versus the jokes intended by the filmmakers  if anything this film is worse than the trailers  coupled with feig and the casts blatant insulting of past fans in their promotion of the film who had concerns with the project not the sexist harrassing assholes who are everywhere and in every fandom i mean those that got lumped in wholesale with those assholes and were dismissed entirely ala james rolfe and the various behindthescenes details weve been privy to that beforehand its not unexpacted that this was going to be a trainwreck but one that will be reliant on personal opinion and tastes in humor to decide if the bad is worth sitting through for the jokes  and in my opinion its a film i never want to see hide nor hair of again
Jul 10 2016,negative,terrible movie hollywood needs to stop rebootingremaking great films and re work the bad ones this was an utter failure
Jul 10 2016,positive,it was like watching a love letter to ghostbusters fans there were enough respectful nods to the original to keep fans happy while still having enough new material ideas and jokes to enable it to stand on its own feet  a nice mix of comic styles both mirroring the style of the originals comedy while introducing some modern contemporary comedic elements as well  exciting funny and scary enough although it did get a bit silly in places as did the original to be honest  the silliness is fine in this context however we are talking about supernatural fiction afterall and just added to the blast of an experience that this movie is  will be seeing it in the cinema again tonight and the bluray will be in my collection when it comes out
Jul 10 2016,neutral,ghostbusters lacks any originality to make it a worthwhile watch still it does make a fair effort lets start with the positives the cast is very impressive kristen wiig melissa mccarthy kate mckinnon and leslie jones all shine in their roles they are all funny comedians and are my favorite parts of the film chris hemsworth also does a fine job in his role unfortunately the film doesnt allow any of these actors to fully succeed the script is too reliant on nostalgia from the original film it doesnt try hard enough to just make a good movie also the film isnt as funny as it shouldve been i chuckled a couple of times but i was hoping that i wouldve been laughing out loud the film doesnt justify why it exists it is just a cash grab overall this isnt as bad as the internet trolls have it to be still the film isnt good enough to justify a recommendation
Jul 10 2016,negative,not at all worth the hype
Jul 10 2016,negative,its a 310 film a bunch of sitcom level actresses in a blockbuster level film isnt going to go well the special effects were great the cameos were nice the harold ramis bust was a nice touch the product placement was shamless even if the acting had been any good it would have been awful no plot and the film was pretty much advert advert cameo from someone from the he original advert advert cameo advert advert cameo i think they only set it in times square so they could max out the adverts
Jul 10 2016,negative,this movie was very meh it wasnt worth all the hoopla the movie plays out like a horrendously edited cartoon that starts off good but becomes boring and all over the place in the middle and end the jokes seemed forced and were very hit and miss the villain was weak and had very poor motivation wiig and mccarthy were just there and dialed down from their usual fare mckinnon provided a chuckle or two but was annoying overall what made her stand out in the trailers didnt work in the context of the movie it felt like she was in another movie hemsworth and jones were the only standouts only thing is hemsworths character became annoying after they beat you over the head with his idiocy the special effects were good also but thats where the praise ends feig and company should be embarrassed
Jul 10 2016,negative,the constant callbacks to the original do this uninspired product no favours nostalgia is not a crutch for lazy filmmaking simply put ghostbusters 2016 doesnt do enough to justify its own existence that the people involved are so much better than this makes it all the more disappointing
Jul 10 2016,neutral,if we call this a comedy science fiction film they did a great job in providing comedic characters and situations  and up to a certain point that makes this a fun film to watch but when comedy finally has to be put aside to let science fiction save the city then the experience becomes weaker and somewhat tiring to watch watch this film without letting go of  low expectations for the climax
Jul 10 2016,negative,mediocre movie bad writing mostly forced and bad jokes nothing special
Jul 10 2016,negative,a dick punch to defeat the main ghost is just an example of the poor writing
Jul 10 2016,negative,filled with racial stereotyping and sexist manbashing this film isnt even a shadow of its original source material
Jul 10 2016,negative,unfortunately this movie is a hot pile of garbage  and yet again proves professional critics are completely out of touch with their jobs
Jul 10 2016,negative,so certified fresh is 75 or higher yet this movie at 73 is certified fresh guess a little kickback from the studio fixed that
Jul 10 2016,negative,terrible movie just watch the original again
Jul 10 2016,negative,this movie is bad i do not have to see it i know the hole story of the movie of the ending how its make
Jul 10 2016,negative,travesty of the movie feminists and sjws raped the ghostbusters franchise with low brow toilet humor and characters with zero depth what a man hating mess and critics applaud them for it such a joke the fresh rating proves that rotten tomatoes cant be trusted the fact that intelligentwell written entertaining movie like batman vssuperman has the 27 rating and this abamination has 73 makes me sick
Jul 10 2016,negative,it was difficult to get away to watch this having two kids and a hosting popular morning zoo radio show but i managed i sniffed and burped my way through this and i was howling the entire time dey had good chemustree
Jul 10 2016,negative,pure garbage as in a badly written snl sketchif you hate men and enjoy jokes about all men beeing idiots then this is a movie for youdisgusting how this trash can abuse the ghostbuster ip
Jul 10 2016,positive,its amazing to see a movie that finally shows young girls we as women can be anything we put our mind to and that woman can kickass
Jul 10 2016,positive,i loved every minute of it very entertaining and hilariously funny highly recommended
Jul 10 2016,negative,i dont know why they made this after seeing it its awful there is nothing wrong with the female actors but the script they give them made me not like there fictional characters
Jul 10 2016,positive,aside from  the somewhat underwhelming climax this was an excellent film with a couple of scares and a whole lot of laughs
Jul 10 2016,positive,for once listen to the critic meter on this one and not the sad mras who are too busy crying instead of just watching a fun silly movie
Jul 10 2016,positive,i had high hopes going in i was not disapointed very funny it was a stand alone movie and did not ruin the original for me felt very fresh and fun
Jul 10 2016,positive,incredibly funny with an allstar cast that give fantastic performances great supernatural action and adapted the original perfectly while not doing the same thing and by adapting enough so it has no relation whatsoever this is must watch for everyone kids will love it diehard ghostbusters fans will love it and occasional audience members will also enjoy the time
Jul 10 2016,negative,how this has a certified fresh rating when this garbage flick has only a 52 percent here with one positive more than negative of top critics a flurry of them are utterly bought and paid bloggers who were going to praise this piece of shit no matter how bad it was and it has barely more than that when all critics are accounted for how this shlock got more positive reviews than so many other films is indicative of how many virtue signally shills there are this movie is start to finish garbage its loud its obnoxious it makes obvious low brow humor it mocks men relentlessly going well beyond good natured ribbing and veering way into the flat out mean spirited it goes out of its way to spite the original and on top of it it utterly fails to capture the tone of the original in any way its not ghostbusters
Jul 10 2016,negative,only thing worth watching for was chris hemsworth and even his character was just painfully stupid female leads are all good actors but by god even they can not but any light to these characters the plot makes little sense and the simple male hate throughout the movie was enough for me to want my money back this movie should not exist there is no reason to make it other than easy money from people who are interested in fart jokes and it is a slap on your face no matter what your gender is go watch ice age
Jul 10 2016,positive,it was a fun movie for a hot summer afternoon
Jul 10 2016,negative,they came  they saw they failed
Jul 10 2016,positive,really want to see shame its not in 4dx
Jul 10 2016,negative,lol how the fuck do 91 want to see this shit
Jul 10 2016,negative,they used the same plot formula as the amazing spiderman tmnt avengers etc
Jul 10 2016,positive,its gunna be one hell of a movie
Jul 9 2016,negative,embargo on reviews  you know what this means this movie is crap  just like trailers tell you do not go see it before reviews come out teach greedy idiots a lesson
Jul 9 2016,negative,hahahhaha a total box office floppc failure at its finest
Jul 9 2016,positive,brians movie review ghostbusters     tonight i just watch the most debated reboot in cinemas history done by paul fieg who is know for his r rated comedies stared by mostly women the key word here is reboot and not remake because this film is nothing like the original in the aspect of story i will now discuss the good and the bad of this film    the good this film is a total different film than the original and it does well standing on its own as a new ghostbuster film the biggest stand out for this film is kate mckinnon as jillian holtzman she is off the wall and just fits so well in the world of ghostbusters i could have totally seen her character as someone who could have appeared in maybe the cartoons or even the first film chris hemsworth is also hilarious and overall the whole cast does well carrying laughs scares and even deep moments all the characters in this didnt feel like copies of old ones and i liked that because maybe one day if they do this expanded universe maybe there would be room for even more original characters i dont see why people say the effects are bad when some of the worst effects ive ever seen is actually in recent films are from the 3rd hobbit film the thing prequel or also shall we look up the rock in the mummy returns i know not super recent but there is always worst  the effects didnt bother me at all though i also thought the 3rd act was just fun and entertaining and made me think back to the 2009 video game the villian in this film and his plot felt really fresh the villians of the first 2 were pretty much the same thing and this felt like a more high risk situation because spoiler alert people actually die i also didnt feel like this film was an attack on men whats ever like everyone seems to think it is plus there was alot of science in this film like they actually sounded like they knew what they were talking about even patty who is not a racial stereotype at all in this she actually brings ideas to the team and provides alot of knowledge of the city for them and even comes up big for the team in the end fthe cameos felt fun and every one is the theatre enjoyed them even harold ramis had 2 nods towards him which i felt were very fitting and it showed much appreciation but i enjoyed this film alot i laughed alot and i would defiantly watch this fun summer movie again    the bad while watching the film i actually didnt find alot i hated there were maybe 2 jokes i feel were in bad taste which is already a scene revealed in alot of teasers and its when rownan gets hit in the crotch with a proton stream its really one of the only jokes i felt were in bad taste this movie is also no masterpiece it is fun and entertaining like the original film was in its day another small issue i had is something i stated i liked and it was the motive of rownan yes i thought he was a good and new different villian but you find out his lust to destroy the world is because to some it up he is bullied which kind of is like well then ok     overall  this is the new ghostbusters and they are fun and smart and have alot of room to grow  it isnt a perfect film with some issues but it doesnt nearly deserve the amount of hate it has received by many of people kate mckinnon stole the show for me and i loved meeting these new members of a hopefully growing universe i dont recommend this film to children under the age of well about 11 there are a couple adult themed jokes but nothing more than they have probably already have seen or heard in a marvel film the cameos are fun the humor is fun the action is fun and this is a true summer movie but most importantly it is also a ghostbusters film that stands on its own i will gladly see it again and look forward for its blu ray release     brians movie grade 355    bonus round     here are the many insults id like to address and shed light on about this film that ive herd for months    no on wants to see bridesmaids 2    this film is nothing like bridesmaids and it doesnt even shad close to the same plot as bridesmaids and you calling it bridesmaids is like me calling aliens a terminator sequel because it shares the same director and some cast members big whoop directors been using same actors in multiple films for years    there goes my childhood just getting destroyed    grow up this movie doesnt hurt the original and it doesnt try to replace it it is a reboot and it is bringing a series many love to a new generation it isnt marty mcfly asking his mom to the enchantment under the sea dance it isnt erasing your childhood    this movie is just a man hate film    yeah sure okay because this film is like the heman woman haters club from the little rascals this film does no such things to bring men down kevins character does not represent every man in this movie its 4 women who are ghostbusters deal with it      why couldnt they just make ghostbusters 3 instead of this garbage    the movie isnt garbage and the original cast is old now i love those guys but murray wasnt going to do it ramis died it wouldnt have been right the closest to 3 we got was the game im satisfied with the game and this film    they are just going to nag at the ghost until it goes away    just stop    ghostbusters filmreview review
Jul 9 2016,negative,definitely not good please dont be suckered in to believing the score above my review there is no way this movie is fresh even if the original never happened
Jul 9 2016,negative,absolutely terrible
Jul 9 2016,positive,good act i  act iii plus best credits sequence i have ever seen  different from the originals only in how comedy has changed over the past 30 years from antiestablishment to the random bizarre  the best part comes from kate mckinnons character in act iii when one of her actions is accompanied by an instrumental version of the classic theme  make sure you stay after the credits
Jul 9 2016,positive,enjoyed every minute of it original storyline that still pays homage to the original mixed with some great jokes and some great talent
Jul 9 2016,negative,sad attempt at a reboot that wasnt needed dont waste your money to see it in theaters
Jul 9 2016,negative,i really honestly wanted to give this movie a chance i am a huge fan of the original and its sequel and i had hoped that i would be pleasantly surprised with this i was pleasantly disgusted this movie is filled with negative stereotypes terrible overused cliches jokes that are too obvious and fall flat and overthetop acting fail fail fail all around the board
Jul 9 2016,positive,i saw the original ghostbusters and they were okay  this remake looks interesting and it will probably be funny im glad melissa mccarthy is in this
Jul 9 2016,negative,saw an early screening its just not ghostbusters at all  i like the actors individually but they just dont click like the original cast did  chris hemsworth was the only one that was truly funny  the jokes just fell flat otherwise  the film feels like a cartoon more than a ghostbusters movie with the cheesy effects that are blatantly cgi  dont pay money for this
Jul 9 2016,negative,the previews look awful and to be honest after reading the backstory of this movie its as if the writers wanted to destroy the franchise    im all for female leads but the way this was done was vindictive to to point of ruining the film    sony can keep this hot load to themselves
Jul 9 2016,negative,was able to watch this at prescreening in private residence the director was there but he knew what we were all thinking  i enjoy each one of these actresses in other movies and tv shows but for some reason their overall screen presence suffered perhaps because of the large personalities all in one room  there was no real chemistry and the story line went more with the cartoon than it did the previous two movies  the only shining light in this movie was the overlyfunny male receptionist kevin patty was written in as a very loud annoying person which she clearly is not in real life  the entire time i felt like this movie went with more of an agenda than it wanted to tell an actual story we are woman hear us roar is great but there has to be substance to go along with it  this movie is lacking in both plot and storylines and for that i rate it a 1 star
Jul 9 2016,negative,the new ghostbusters had some good parts but lacked a cohesive whole sadly i didnt hear anybody laughing in the theater but me and i didnt laugh very often thats just sad as a female ghost hunter i really wanted to love this movie although mckinnon and jones really gave their all wiig and mccarthys performances were pretty vanilla that said surprisingly the movie doled out some serious food for thought the suggestion that people with real paranormal experiences are often left without reputable help could have been developed to greater poignancy the allegation that americans are easily snowed because they so quickly forget the past would have been better placed as a more substantial part of the script ideas like these only fleetingly mentioned could have led to more meaningful exploration and authentic jokes to work this movie needed extensive script rewrites and more distinctive less silly art direction
Jul 9 2016,positive,this movie is top to bottom fun its not just a redo of the original with women in it its a new movie based on the comedic strengths of the great women at the helm lots of cameos and fun stuff   cant believe how great the four leads are  recommend to anyone who likes fun
Jul 9 2016,positive,like bridesmaids the heat to a lesser extent and spy this is simply a funny well crafted film with a great core cast the four ghostbusters  kevin chris hemsworth is a revelation as a comic actor i know he gets to do fun stuff as thor but this is just class and its a great story    sure if you have to view it against others rather than a stand alone film its probably the 2nd best ghostbusters film but not by too much it does some things better it is very innovative has some clever action beats very clever action and yes again the cast is fantastic to get 5 actors that have such great chemistry in whichever grouping you put them is good work ill be watching it again ill be hoping those waging a campaign against it for whatever reason benign or hate related dont stop people going and making their own minds up because i want to see these characters again if id never heard of the first film if it never existed this would have done more than enough to stand omits own two feet and start a new series    but as some of you know i was at the cinema opening weekend for the first film recorded it on itv on christmas day bought the vhs i bought the dvd i bought the bluray so im what you could call a fan of the original film the blasphemy of reversing the gender of 5 of the original characters turns out ot be what many   of us thought it was irrelevant to the film itself and cool for the film industry yes there still arent enough films that star women as lead characters and strong intelligent ones at that but the most important thing is did they make a good film yes yes they did    go see for yourself people comedy is subjective but odds are youll have a good time
Jul 9 2016,neutral,looking back this really was the first shot fired in the trend of updated for modern times tellings of beloved franchises but as a stand alone i dont think its as bad as it gets credit for
Jul 9 2016,negative,truly awful i watched this at a prerelease screening and spent far more time cringing than smiling and i never laughed not even once sjws need only apply    however from what ive seen from professional reviewers the fix is on theyre speaking about it in glowing terms to keep from being labeled a sexist or misogynist placing their careers in jeopardy and thats truly sad free speech even among the press is dying
Jul 9 2016,neutral,um well this was just okay  they relied heavily on slapsticklike humor and that never tickles my fancy  i love the four leading ladies but kate mckinnon and leslie jones were basically playing themselves in gray jumper suits  the biggest flop of this movie was chris hemsworth who was totally unfunny and completely unnecessary  still there were a few moments i enjoyed and i still live for any collaboration with kristen wiig and melissa mccarthy  better luck next time
Jul 9 2016,negative,top critics  give this 46 rotten should be more  no issues at all with female ghostbusters but   1 trailers and all 40 yes 40 tv spots look unfunny and like a cheap scooby doo movie  2 the movie does not follow on from the first 2 classic films  3 the jokes are not funny at all  4 all men in the film are apparently assholes or bimbos  5 paul feig insulted the whole fan base including myself   this piece of cinematic crap belongs in the rubbish bin
Jul 9 2016,negative,unfunny not scary just another bland remake to cash grab
Jul 9 2016,negative,my problem was not the fact that it was a ladys film instead my issue was with the cheap jokes and the awful out run gags that sony tries to present as funny that being said what else can you expect from a remake of a timeless classic
Jul 9 2016,negative,do not see this film    ghostbusters 2016 review  the worst movie of summer 2016    man do i feel bad for everyone else who attended their early screening of ghostbusters 2016  i expected the movie to bomb after the first trailer dropped  ultimately it doesnt bomb it freakin sinks to the bottom and explodes never to be seen or remembered again  never have i seen a reboot be soooo disrespectful to its source material until today  i feel sick to my stomach knowing that people tried to defend this film to the point of pulling out the gender card for every argument made    the writing is ultimately basic and flat resulting in a boring if not irritating experience  jokes are forced into the script and slapstick humor is present through the entire film  speaking of slapstick there is literally a slap scene that just makes the entire film worse than it already was  the tall chick i forgot who she was because of how stereotypical her character was was so stereotypical of a black woman that i was really disgusted by the very stereotype  whats worse is that their chemistry is next to nonexistant  theres no real bond between them just done awkward jokes and really bad oneliners    this movie also managed to be sexist itself  this film portrays most men as stupid people or rude assholes  chris hemsworths character is not only the funniest character in the whole movie hes also the dumbest in the movie  literally  his intelligence level is next to almost 0 and yet he manages to be the funniest character in the whole film  not only that but the final ghost is defeated the fembusters shoot him in his ghost dick  yeah thats how hes defeated  shooting him in his ghost junk  facepalm ghostbusters fans are pissed and now i know why this film is garbage    dont expect to be crossing streams or feeling attached to tge new group its next to impossible  bad writting reverse sexism horrid cast performance bad cgi disrespectful fanservice and terribly executed forcedhumor haunt this film from being at least a decent one  ladies and gentlemen this one busted
Jul 9 2016,negative,saw an early screening of this movie and let me tell you  probably the worst film ive seen since green lantern absolute mess of terribly done implausible cgi and complete failure to make 4 loveable ghostbusters like in the originals i wept for one of my favorite classic films because this reboot is a disgrace to the franchise  do not go waste your time and money on it
Jul 9 2016,negative,went to see an early premiere of this movie and let me tell you its on of the worst movie if not the worse of all time its bad its just plain bad movie its nothing like the original let me tell you spoilers  1 they kill ghosts in the movie you heard me kill makes me even wonder why its called ghostbusters  2 they kill the boss if you call it by shooting him in the dick fucking hell just end my life this sounds like the type of ending that someone will jokingly write what the fuck mate  obviously theres more than this shit but im not gonna write the entire thing because honestly i dont fuckin care this movie is shite dont watch it if you see this review or any other review but still proceed to watch the film go fuck yourself mate have a gday 
Jul 9 2016,negative,jokes fall flat and the cg was bad dont waste your money on this one
Jul 9 2016,positive,its not as bad as some make out its not as good as it could be a solid movie but holding back from its full potential
Jul 9 2016,positive,not as bad as the trailersstill not quite as good as the original
Jul 9 2016,negative,dont forget sony has paid critics to rate it higher than it is
Jul 9 2016,negative,very disappointing  as a stand alone film its average at best but as a ghostbusters film its not good comedy is good in places and the female cast are good but should be a stand alone film not linked to ghostbusters
Jul 9 2016,negative,looks terrible reviews given reflect this
Jul 9 2016,negative,i am a feminist and have no dick and this movie is shit
Jul 9 2016,positive,you can beat the original ghostbuster its not bad but they just could make a different movie with different title instead of trying to gain extra attention from audience by riding on old classic movie success a few cameo appearances of actors from the classic ghostbusters and quite funny joke about the fire station for rent do not justify calling this movie ghostbuster again imho besides that and the most cheesy villain you have ever seen this movie is not bad and lead actings are superb
Jul 8 2016,positive,give woman a chance you might be very surprised
Jul 8 2016,neutral,its honestly not horrible and its not great its okay the best thing about the movie is the special effects its a little over hated but i could see why people dont really like it
Jul 8 2016,negative,it just plain sucks
Jul 8 2016,negative,shallow and pedantic
Jul 8 2016,positive,love the trailer and the clips
Jul 8 2016,positive,amazing much better than the trailers very funny and worth every penny
Jul 8 2016,negative,i will review the film but based on the trailer this is how i feel the movie may surprise me especially since i do believe these women are funny based off of what i have seen on snl  but i do not care for their petty attacks calling people who dislike what they have seen sexist the film just does not look visually great and most of the jokes didnt land
Jul 8 2016,positive,great show good to see them back
Jul 8 2016,positive,a slow start that relies too much on the comedic stars ends with an upbeat coming out party for kate mckinnon and leslie jones  the additional scenes and the music reward you for sticking around to watch the credits
Jul 8 2016,negative,lets face it the box office is already screwed because of this disaster of a movie
Jul 8 2016,negative,check out this review of the movie at youtube its worse than people think it is lmao 
Jul 8 2016,negative,awful so god awful that the it should never be shown anywhere ever again dont waste your time its that bad its awful i could go on and on 
Jul 7 2016,negative,this film was rape     writing an actual broken down review of this shit fest will involve using both halves of my brain which is more brain power they should have used to realize that using similar types of dry slapstick humor like spy and bridesmaids which are great movies doesnt work for a movie like ghostbusters that is why i find this movie so fucking offensive     all women cast was a great idea in my opinion but the execution was safe and unoriginal to put it straight forward who ever was a part of this production should be ashamed
Jul 7 2016,negative,the casting of leslie jones as the racial stereotype of a loudmouthed roughntough urbanblack woman left me feeling a bit dirty it isnt funny its racist i dont find racism very funny this is one of the major problems the blackactor community has with hollywood she states in the film that she knows the streets of new york this phrase makes me think of a hood persona  another identifying stereotyped trait thats perpetuated by the music and movie industry working between yelp a gps and a few social connections  anyone can get to know the streets this overused and frankly offensive racial stereotype was far from necessary but feig isnt new to using stereotypes go back to bridesmaids and rewatch the brazilian bbq scene teehee haha brazilians are dirty and their food is too now were all sick thanks for the subtle racism feig you keep right up with it    leslie could have been a smart and reserved scientist too it wouldnt have broken the movie any more than the lame script already did sorry it wasnt funny or entertaining by my standards this film was not very progressive all the while trying to break some sort of barrier  arguably a manufactured barrier if this was supposed to represent equality what a horrendous attempt a movie who casts men as misogynists or idiots black people are cast as racial stereotypes and promotes the use of female violence to retort to anything they disagree with sounds familiar when reading studies done of the united states population where white women do receive significantly higher amounts of all degrees compared to any other racial or gender category females score higher than males in grade school disparity in educational scoring in the black community always has been a major problem and the fact that women make up half of domestic abuse perpetrators way to turn those depressing realities into a joke go ahead and see the movie for yourself if you pay attention youll notice how truly progressive this film really is the original film was far more progressive than this attempt was  and it wasnt even trying to be
Jul 7 2016,negative,had potential but really blew it on every turn was not enjoyable to me  and i really wanted to like it  very disappointing as i normally enjoy 34 of the female cast in what they do not a fan of mccarthy in general  i havent watched the extended edition as of yet but i really cant bring myself to pay money for that p
Jul 7 2016,negative,this movie sucked it tried so hard to make the audience laugh that it was a major fail special effects were cool but everything else sucked
Jul 7 2016,negative,the worst kind of hollywood crap  take a good movie and remake it into what they believe the american people should want  if people dont like it they will rig the system to say that its a great movie  i used to come to rotten tomatoes because i believed them to be unbiased no more they have sunk to a new low in protecting dog crap like the new ghostbusters movie from the hurtful words of honest critics  i am greatly disappointed with this movie if this qualifies as a movie and with rotten tomatoes for tricking the audience with a score of 73 pitiful
Jul 7 2016,positive,want to see looks funny
Jul 7 2016,negative,garbage collage of snl skits thrown together that is insulting to the original  it was terrible
Jul 7 2016,positive,awesome movie nice one really enjoyed it laughed a lot hope they make another
Jul 7 2016,negative,not really entertaining at all the camos were the only thing that excited me but bill murrays role was quite poor
Jul 7 2016,negative,is this the most racist film of the new millennium     whitey and whitey are ivy league professors one is even a published author the other whitey is a nuclear engineer but blackie works in a subway     secondly ms jones is it seems to me always standing on the outside of the group because she is black and thus less even look at the poster she is hardly included with the other three women     while perhaps viewing this film will prove me wrong and i will see that ms jones is given a commanding position or certainly one equal to her white costars this remains to be seen      welcome to the 1950s errrrrybody casual racism is alive n kickin
Jul 6 2016,negative,you dont remake a classic maybe continuing on with the story line i predict a trainwreak of a movie
Jul 6 2016,neutral,couple of laughs but why did they even make it in the first place
Jul 6 2016,negative,sony please just stop  we get it you hate men  now go home youre drunk
Jul 6 2016,negative,fool me twice sony the trailer is widely regarded as the raunchiest turd in the history of greenbands no way am i going to waste two hours of my life on this movie then as if ghostbusters has been brought back from the dead the critics gave it a cumulative fresh rating holy crap could ghostbusters be good to compound my confusion the user rating was significantly below the critics which is pretty rare in these circles so who got it right had to rent it to find out  this movie should earn an award for biggest fraud in hollywood  dont know if the critics were paid off or perhaps the trailer lowered their expectations so significantly that the score was inflated by their surprise with its mediocrity but what a waste of the genre im convinced there was no script they just sat there and said hey funny ladies be funny well just keep rolling and find something worth sticking in there  the result 4 improv actors competing for the joke what made the original ghostbusters so magical was that it pretended to be an actual ghost story the cast gave it that gravitas and the comedy was woven in to create levity as needed instead with 2016 its just bad joke after bad joke hey look at how loud i can be heres a fart reference feig has made some real gems but this stinks of studio interference if you havent seen this movie yet you probably should if only to renew your affection for the source material
Jul 6 2016,negative,this excerpt from a 2002 review of scooby doo sums up this film better and more honestly than anything ive seen or read    the acting is stiff the story lacks all trace of wit the sets look like they were borrowed from gilligans island  and the cgi scooby might well be the worst specialeffects creation of the year  richard roeper    just replace scooby with slimermrs slimerghostseffects et all
Jul 6 2016,negative,its been 27 years and this is the best ghostbusters they could give us each of the female gbs in this film are extremely talented  none of this was their fault it was a terrible script  a well meaning but totally wrong director cowriter  his writing partner a complete misfire in every way imaginable oh and the dance sequencesmy god the many many dance sequences ugh
Jul 6 2016,positive,a rarity a retelling that stands on its own with four of the funniest women on screen battling some freaky ghosts some fantastic spectacle and suspense to be had as well highly recommended
Jul 6 2016,negative,absolutely horrific paul feig said this had no link to the originals what so ever clearly a lie as it has slimer the symbol marshmallow man proton packs    its just money making off the back of the originals its nothing but scooby doo meets bridesmaids the film is insulting to the originals    how melissas mcarthy is still getting work is beyond me if your expecting this to be anything like the originals your in for a massive shock unfunny jokes that are stereotypical female jokes that are in all female focused movies save your money
Jul 6 2016,negative,for all the internet arguments this movie was just incredibly forgettable the trailer was horrible and while the movie was better there wasnt too much different the funniest part of the movie is the awkward silence from the audience for about 90 of the jokes which is unfortunate for the actresses they at least obviously gave a lot of effort in their performance but they had terrible writing to work with there are several points in the movie that seemed to come from nowhere or lead nowhere all in all the talents of four very funny women could save the recycled plot the horrible writing and terrible comedy
Jul 6 2016,positive,thumbs up for me a good funny movie with horror and a lot of attention as well as mystery when i saw this movie in the theater i was laughing a lot best ghostbusters movie i would have to say im all about this movie and there was a post credit in the movie witch i hope that means they make a sql with the same actors and actresses they rocked in this movie nothing was bad about theme at all now i know some people did not like this movie well that made me go bananas i dont know why some people where not interested in the movie or they did not like it but hay im all about this movie like i said theres a post credit scene witch means they should make a sql
Jul 6 2016,negative,doesnt look funny at all some movies just shouldnt be remade
Jul 6 2016,positive,great job at a remake of an iconic movie  refreshing  funny these ladies are hilarious and chris hemsworthwell hey its chris hemsworth he was awesome
Jul 6 2016,positive,ghostbusters will be remembered for some cool things the return of the villain you hate most villains in movies this day are too cool to hate the effects both the visual and 3d lastly the comedy it has in it especially chris hemsworth who is a pleasant surprise in the film due to his comedic timing i had fun the two times ive seen it thus far and plan on going a third time    negative while rowan is cool i wish he had more back story they kind of rushed his character to focus on the girls and kevin
Jul 6 2016,negative,after see all the trailers and tv spots and none of them has interested me what so ever and when the director you and sexist or asswhole when you dont like his film
Jul 6 2016,negative,saw an advance screeningits terriblethe ghostbusters have zero chemistry there are few laughs the movie just loathes the male half of the species and the black cliche represented by leslie jones sets racial harmony back 50 years
Jul 6 2016,positive,brilliant forget the politics the haters and the bellyaching about the original and go see it this movie is its own thing  stellar cast interesting work with tropes and kristen wiigs signature brand of heartfelt serious with disarming comedy
Jul 5 2016,negative,what a load of tijuana rat crap
Jul 5 2016,negative,this move was horrible every comedy seen fell flat the cgi looked like it was created back in the 90s dont waste your money wait until its 99 cents on the discount shelf
Jul 5 2016,positive,i cannot wait for number 2 more kevin
Jul 5 2016,positive,im truly surprised this didnt get better reviews the movie was great i loved how every character from the original was in this remake i loved chris hemsworth and kate mckinnon their roles were the best if you remember the original you cant miss this one
Jul 5 2016,positive,movie was much better than i expected lots of funny scenes that kept me laughing movie kept to original feel but with current twist so happy to see original cast cameoed throughout cast members were perfect for the new today version of a classic
Jul 5 2016,positive,after seeing the movie i dont really understand what all the hate is about its actually a really funny movie and really smarter than i thought it would be while it may lose it some focus in the third act
Jul 5 2016,positive, feels like it was using the franchise far too much for its own benefit    there were 4 renditions of the main theme tune which sure it is a catchy song but it wasnt overkill in the original   why was the lead girl so okay with giving up her career on merging general relativity and quantum theory that would be the biggest breakthrough in physics in ages   why did we not see the professor of the university again like shocked or rejecting the evidence of ghosts and what the lead girl was up to i feel that would have made it funny   the lead girl said there was no science in her book at all so how did abby and jillian create the technology how did jillian even develop the technology to be so portable so easily   bill murray wasnt used well enough in the film at all it felt more like he was poking fun at the film  more specifically the girls in it   now that rowan is dead and there arent any more devices why does the town even need the ghostbusters anymore unless someone else starts making similar devices but that would basically be a repeat of the same film    a lot of the jokes werent funny and the scenes were edited together so closely to make it really fast paced but left no time for the jokes to sink in it felt like they were cranking jokes in at every opportunity a lot of the jokes were very childish as well like the fart joke and jillians general responses this isnt an avengers movie you cant do the hulkgroot thing with a human    the nuclear reactor on the top of the car was a major plot device that was not explained for being there definitely deus ex machina   the cgi was very mixed  the proton packs and streams looked excellent but the ghosts werent all great   sigourney weaver could have been used better   feels like the roles were better suited to men really and chris hemsworth was the dumb blonde receptionist and his role change later in the film makes no reflection on him alone   generally did not get what they were talking about sometimes not the scifi technobabble but even the jokes too
Jul 5 2016,negative,an embarrassment to the world of film a spit in the face of cultural staples a setback for women worldwide this should be illegal beneath the geneva convention to expose to a public
Jul 5 2016,negative,was it supposed to be a comedy
Jul 5 2016,positive,not as bad as all the fanboys insisted it would be but also not as good as it could have been    it is first and foremost a comedy in fact that is my primary gripe it almost feels like a series of drug out snl sketches with very little deviation in the comedic writing almost all the characters have to throw in a goofy quip or two in every scene some jokes even feel awkward and cutting room floor material    speaking of which there is also lots of cutting which translates to an abundance of short scenes that dont really progress the story so much as fill time with goofy jokes as a result the movie itself feels way too long     maybe paul feig wasnt the best choice to head this reboot up especially after he proclaimed he wasnt even a fan and insulted the actual fans on numerous occasions     all the cons aside i still feel it is a fun faithful and worthy addition to the franchise i would most definitely recommend it to fans of the original movies or the cartoons
Jul 5 2016,negative,like paul feigs previous movie the heat this appears to be nothing more than a comedy with all the comedy taken out no jokes no discernible plot to speak of no memorable or likable characters terrible cgi possibly the worst theme song ever penned
Jul 5 2016,positive,short ghostbusters is not a bad movie leave the bad marketing aside the acting is not all that bad the cast has a lot of chemistry and overall the movie works lets keep talking about the positive aspects of this movie visually for the most parts it is gorgeous both the special and pracitcal effects are beautiful to look at and do not contrast at all the sets are cool and paul feig manages to give us a lot of classic gb weapons and tools with an updated look now this movie does have a ton of missed oportunities the appearances of the original cast member fall totally flat some action scenes lack well action and the story of the villain lacks all imagination all men in this movie are either stupid or assholes or both and there are no big laughs in a movie that should be a comedy the movie is not painfully unfunny just no big laughs there i think overall it did sursprise me but it has so much more potential maybe feig was a good choice for a director but ging for a pg13 rating was a bad decision or maybe the idea wasnt all that bad they just got the wrong writers and director im not here to judge im here to leave a rating and that will be slightly fresh 35 stars for gb
Jul 5 2016,positive,hey what do you know   its actually good  the effects are great   the main characters are hilarious jeslie jones and kate mckinnon being my favorites  my one problem is that its still got similarities to the last 2 movies  this movies great and i really hope that there isnt gonna be a sequel to this
Jul 4 2016,positive,this was a fun movie in my opinion not as good as the original but definitely not deserving of all the bad press it was getting before opening an enjoyable summer movie and stay till all the credits are finished or you will miss something
Jul 4 2016,positive,a really great reboot with a stellar funny cast and hilarious jokes throughout the effects are stellar and each ghost encounter is a lot of fun especially in 3dsee this thing in imax 3d if you can even if the story is a bit simplistic at times
Jul 4 2016,negative,good character selection and actors is the only thing this film got right horrible story line its the ghostbusters a 2 year old could of wrote a better story a sequel could work but please use different writers
Jul 4 2016,positive,the peopleactually lets be honest here the sexist menwho are trying to push this movies rating down are either cinematically illiterate or lying the new ghostbusters film is fantastic and kate mckinnon is a national treasure who deserves to be as big as her role here should make her
Jul 4 2016,negative,wow even worse than expected 
Jul 4 2016,negative,terrible from the start snore fest
Jul 4 2016,negative,this movie is getting a lot of unfair hate from trolls but its just not good the final product is sloppy the humor relies on the riffing between the cast and its okay
Jul 4 2016,neutral,no this film is not the disaster that everyone thought it would be no its no where as good as the original or the sequel but this new ghostbusters is still a funny wellcasted film that still has the essence of the original without ever feeling like a cynical retread of the originals if you think that the feminazissjws have ruined your franchise youve already made up your mind on this film and wont see it but i dont think its worth the amount of defensedisowning of critical opinion that the awful trailers got from both feminist and biased news media outlets have been giving people
Jul 4 2016,negative,if you were like me when you saw the first trailer and thought it looked terrible then i am here to tell you we were spot on this movie is shit even not taking the original into it its just a bad movie it isnt funny nor is it entertaining   kristen wiig is playing her normal likeable self and is the best of the bunch but i just felt she needed something more then what she was giving here melissa mccarthy is okay and thankfully doesnt go off on her improve here too much this is the first time i have seen leslie jones in anything and she was also okay not as annoying as i thought she was going to be the line they give her when she jumps into the crowd is so stupid we know she is black why have the race line in it stupid and sad in a way i thought kate mckinnon looked the best from the trailer and would be the best part of the movie but she disappoints it is also the first time i have seen her in anything her character just comes off as awkward that is probably down to her lack of acting in movies then we have chris hemsworth who plays the dumb guy i didnt say dumb funny guy because he isnt his character is just stupid and not funny  the effects are for kids dont even get me started on the end credits when you watch it you will understand think the director loves hemsworth   im sure there is more crap i can talk about this but cant be bothered so go watch it and we can talk about how bad it is
Jul 4 2016,positive,this was really funny such a good movie
Jul 4 2016,neutral,today i did the unspeakable and watched the film everyone seems to have hated since the day the trailer has been released and i watched ghostbusters assuming to hate it right away but im going to be completely honest it wasnt as bad as people assumed it was going to be ghostbusters is an entertaining film that was much better than i thought it was going to be the reason ghostbusters turned out to be as entertaining as it was is because of director paul feig and its cast of kristen wiig melissa mccarthy kate mckinnon and leslie jones and to they all do a good job with their roles however though i am a big fan of melissa mccarthy and kristen wiig this was not their best film in fact if it werent for kate mckinnons performance as holtzman the film would not have been as goodshe definitely stole the show and even though leslie jones had some funny moments in her role as patty she still was not as funny as mckinnon paul feig is also one of my favorite directors but this definitely wasnt his best film if you want a better paul feig film give spy 2015 the heat 2013 and bridesmaids 2011 a try even though ghostbusters wasnt the best film of the year it definitely was not the worst and it didnt deserve any of the hate it got from the internet if you want a fun entertaining film with some laughs than i suggest you give ghostbusters a try
Jul 4 2016,negative,20 minutes of footages extracted from trailers show how bad it is
Jul 4 2016,negative,replacing blade with a white character is considered racist but replacing male cast of ghostbusters with females is not considered sexist because i guess male lives dont matter
Jul 4 2016,positive,ghostbusters is a success thanks to the incredibly dynamic and exciting four female leads who revitalise the franchise and bring new life and a new generation to it furthered by the visual effects and magic it is all presented through    review     i dont think its a 55 film but somebody has to balance out the unsolicited low marks trolls have been giving it
Jul 4 2016,positive,it does not capture the excitement of the original but it will still be fun for those who have seen the original much in the way of jurassic world
Jul 4 2016,positive,i loved it  i thought in many ways it was superior to the original  i thought the story flowed throughout and the action sequences supported to overall narrative  im with the majority of reviewers in that mckinnon and hemsworth steal the movie  wiig is great in her role and her on screen relationship with mccarthy worked very well  jones was fine    more this wednesday on my podcast 
Jul 4 2016,negative,the reboot part of the new ghostbusters movie is the problem not the female cast     there are a few cherished classics like ghostbusters back to the future etc that  i feel should not mess with now if this was a new ghostbusters movie and these ladies who i like by the way were opening up their own franchise maybe in a different city i would like with that i hate how people are spinning it so if you dont like the movie then you are sexist or a hurt fanboy i love the kick butt female rey character from the new star wars the force awakens moviebecause she is a new kick butt female character but i would have been upset if the say made luke a lisa in a star wars reboot      please make some new female characters and new female heroes not recycled male roles there are many awesome female actresses some of which are in this movie who deserve new roles they can make their own giving them old male roles puts them in a box thats nearly impossible to break free of
Jul 3 2016,positive,this was good  certainly worth the trip not sure what it was about the first that made it so good and so rewatchable but this doesnt quite do it bloody good though 
Jul 3 2016,positive,great writing just different enough from the original fun cameos amazing cast
Jul 3 2016,negative,im sorry but it looks like its going to suck horribly not cause of what others are saying it doesnt look funny    im sorry but not even a free ticket will have me go see this
Jul 3 2016,negative,wish i could give no stars
Jul 3 2016,negative,dear lordim not sure what to say   the opening of this movie is good its spooky and feels real after that is a nose dive into this dumpsterfire im not sure whats worsethe actingthe script the effects or just directing and editing  all jokes fall flat the product placement is in your face anyone that claims this film is mediocre good movie is insane  go watch a proper movie like the secret life of pets you will get more out of it
Jul 3 2016,positive,very fun movie with lots of laughs great cameos from the original cast  decent plot yeah its not the original but its something new  fun mckinnon stole the movie
Jul 3 2016,positive,great movie these woman are among the best comedians on the planet
Jul 3 2016,negative,quite disappointed found a few parts funny but otherwise storyline was poorz
Jul 3 2016,negative,this movie was horrible the main characters were bland really bad jokes made me want to leave the theater in disgust and there was at least 10 fart jokes for the sake of you dont see this movie
Jul 3 2016,positive,loved it very good movie great 3d scary at times funny but as funny as expected
Jul 3 2016,negative,could not believe how awful this movie was
Jul 3 2016,negative,theres a fucking dance scene in the moviewhy do you have a dance scene in ghostbusters they didnt even introduce the containment until the credits what the fuck they use the trap in the movie one time and they only trap one ghost in the entire movie they use the blasters like guns the proton pack blasters is not a gun its simply contains the ghost until they trap in the fucking trap you cannot disintegrate a ghost by simply hitting it with a proton pack blaster this movie is not funny dont waste your money on it  why does the ghostbusters ekg meter look like a cotton candy machine theyre not trying to make candy theyre trying to find ghost its like this director and writers decided to take everything that was great about the two movies and just flush it down the drain yay i love pg 2016 world
Jul 3 2016,negative,saw this film in a test screening its much worse than we all may have feared its without question the worst movie i have ever seen an absolute disgrace what was sony thinking
Jul 3 2016,negative,so let me make sure i understandyou remake ghostbusters with women because that will somehow help advance the cause of equality for all but then you replace africanamerican zeddemore whose character was a blue collar practical voice of reason with token streetwise and sassy black woman 672   she could have been a scientist but insteadhell they should have just had martin lawrence do the role in dragpleaseplease deliver some hilarious line about breaking your foot off in their behinds gold
Jul 3 2016,neutral,expectations was that it was going to be funny wasnt funny and tried to hard acting wise 
Jul 3 2016,positive,what ghostbusters offers is a fun energetic and positive ride starring some of the funniest people on earth a love letter to fans of the original the film doesnt let up with the laughs and is visually stunning
Jul 3 2016,positive,haters gonna hate very funnyrecommend 2 any1 with a funny bone
Jul 2 2016,negative,this movie looks like itll  be the lowest tier adam sandler style piece of shit money grubbing fanbaiting agendapushing trash well get this year    so in short its probably gonna be ass
Jul 2 2016,negative,ok but not the as adult geared as original
Jul 2 2016,positive,i cant decide which of these ladies amused me the most because they were all great and for the purists or there there was plenty of nostalgia from the originals without being a duplicate
Jul 2 2016,negative,i didnt like this that much i wasnt one of those arrogant assholes who judged this without even seeing it i went into the movie with an open mind and took me a while to process all my thoughts  positives  kristen wiig kate mckinnon and leslie jones also the 3d effects cause i saw it in 3d were pretty good and the cgi and visual effects were great  negatives   melissa mccarthy out of everyone in the movie she just looked so damn robotic and just looked like she didnt care and her running joke about wonton soup got old it was funny the first time but it kept getting repetitive and irritated me also chris hemsworth was bad i dont really care too much for him as an actor why he has the weakest films in the mcu to me he just was so dumb and annoying his character has been played out so many damn times and my biggest negatives terrible writing cause the movies fucking boring as hell a 2 hour movie that felt like 4 hours and the movie at times is a fucking disgrace to the original one that i absolutely love   if your curious check this out if not just dont watch it  my rating 410
Jul 2 2016,negative,not the abysmal abortion internet trolls touted it to be but it was still horrible the writing was incredibly weak
Jul 2 2016,positive,i see that a lot of people are rating it before they see the movie i just saw the movie and have to say it was amazing
Jul 2 2016,positive,totally what i expected    my 11 year old sons most anticipated summer movie and i found it easy to watch and enjoyable  does not deserve all the social media hate by any means  a perfect summer friday night movie
Jul 2 2016,negative,i love it when a female character leads a strong supporting cast in a great story like in alien and the force awakens unfortunately the new ghostbusters fails on all three accounts i feel this is going to be used as a reason females cant be leads in the future
Jul 2 2016,positive,funny and has its own toe of flow with the balance of obvious dimwitted joke to the hilarious one for the books kick
Jul 2 2016,positive,fun enough summer movie with some very cool cameos
Jul 2 2016,negative,cheap humor paralyzing story overacted wacky drama
Jul 2 2016,positive,ghostbusters drags its feet a little too much in its first act but that doesnt transcend its laughoutloud starpower or zany ghostbusting climax
Jul 2 2016,positive,its not as funny or as good as the original but this reboot has a lot of humour and charm that creates an infectiously fun experience dont listen to internet haters this is a great experience that holds lots of respect for its roots and certainly as good as a ghostbusters reboot was ever going to get its four leads are fun to watch and this comedy capet provides a modern team of ghostbusters for a new generation
Jul 2 2016,positive,this new ghostbusters relies just enough on the old material to make this new generation not totally worthless
Jul 1 2016,negative,ghostbusters 2016 is nothing but a shameless cashin of the ghostbusters franchise whats the point of remaking ghostbusters but with women not saying that women arent better than men fck of you feminazis but ghostbusters only worked because of its specific cast of memorable and well known actors i know feminazis are going to eat this shit up saying that its better than the original and try to silence those who say otherwise the whole situation with james rolfe  countless others
Jul 1 2016,negative,i have not enjoyed this movie its not funnyits racist against men and it have to much camoe in it  if you love the orginal and the second ghostbusters movie close to your heart go see that instead  this 2016 shit remake is one big pile of shit dont see this
Jul 1 2016,positive,although this is movie has some problems its going to become an instant classic
Jul 1 2016,negative,youll pretty much get what the trailer showed which isnt pretty or impressive     this will simply go down as a flop and a bad idea with poor execution
Jul 1 2016,positive,very good it gave its props to the original
Jul 1 2016,positive,i loved this movie was just like how i felt during the original movie this was extremely funny and exciting every moment was pure joy  clearly the bad ratings are from the gender bias issue going on right now with online bullies please see the truth and see it for yourself it has to be the best movie ive seen this year all that negativity was from before the movie was even made so sad the worst thing of all is that some people wont know about that and will assume the ratings were from people who saw the movie  if only they knew just how good this movie is these ghostbusters are very entertaining and i was blown away so was my dad everyone in the theater clapped and screamed at the end havent seen that much enthusiasm for a movie im a long while  everyone there loved it
Jul 1 2016,positive,funny but not too funny
Jul 1 2016,positive,the new ghostbusters freshfunny new take on classic kate mckinnon and kristen wig are the funniest ghostbusters and they great cameos from original movie pretty good special effects are pretty good
Jul 1 2016,negative,it is a feat in itself to make a movie based in the ghostbusters universe that boring and aggressively unfunny    the movie opens up with a joke that just absolutely falls flat and somehow goes downhill from there it was like improv gone horribly wrong melissa mcarthy was insufferable and thor was unforgivable    didnt the director say he couldnt wait to explore the ghostbuster universe so so so so much he could have done and all he did was take ideas from the real ghostbusters reference old movies and add some horrible looking special effects monsters    do you remember the old ghostbusters where the main villain was zuul the babylonian god well the main villain in this is just a bully victim out for revenge its 2016 why wouldnt it be    every character in the movie is an absolute goofball no one was serious and when no one is serious you cant take a movie seriously thus you do not get enveloped and thus its boring as shit    the black woman was such a stereotype i was offended and im a white male    im glad harold ramis wasnt subjected to that    6 all for bill murrays first cameo and the guy from mad tvs scream
Jul 1 2016,positive,girls can bust ghost as well as the boys
Jul 1 2016,positive,this movie is funny
Jul 1 2016,positive,around the film was one negative all did not accept the fact that the main characters have become the girls but i do not understand why after watching all of this negative opinion  the movie is not bad  although there is the stupid jokes and annoying kevin type characters  but the film is not so as he is criticized 
Jul 1 2016,positive,we loved it very funny and a great take with the female cast
Jul 1 2016,negative,harold ramis would be very ashamed of you if you think this movie was better than the original
Jul 1 2016,negative,absurd movie that panders to social justice warriors good acting and a decent script was secondary to a ridiculous womens rights agenda
Jun 30 2016,positive,kept the whole theater laughing for alot of the movie i thought it was hilarious
Jun 30 2016,negative,this movie is going to be fucking garbage
Jun 30 2016,positive,was a cool funny movie love the cameos of the original stars
Jun 30 2016,positive,the cast visual effects and action were great but the jokes were terrible and sometime it got boring
Jun 30 2016,positive,it was exactly what i expected some good laughs and some ghosts if youre looking for a movie with a great story line you probably dont want to see this one but if you just want to relax and be entertained this is a good one to see
Jun 30 2016,positive,the best paul feig movie ive seen yet
Jun 30 2016,negative,too much comedy  original was way better
Jun 29 2016,negative,although it had some genuinely funny moments the vast majority of the humor fell completely flat for me the kyle character was painful to watch in every scene and the villain damn near put me to sleep i think my main problem with the movie is not a single one of the characters felt like they could be a real person
Jun 29 2016,positive,dont listen to the negative reviews this movie was fantastic from start to finish and i couldnt stop laughing kate mckinnon stole the show and my heart and i cant wait to see it again
Jun 29 2016,positive,amazing this movie at least in my opinion is way better than the original
Jun 29 2016,negative,i dont mind an all female cast i was excited about it excited for this movie even finally seeing it with an openmind and without comparing to the original this movie suffersa lot the story is flawed the humor was mediocre and the cgi was terrible absolutely terrible the entire movie is equal to the scoobydoo live action films i was hoping for a slightly good film i found it just okay
Jun 29 2016,positive,a lot of fun amazing effects great ensemble with kate mckinnon stealing every scene that shes in  plenty of throwbacks to the original including key plot points actors ghosts music and more with enough new to make it fresh and not just a sentimental rehash  really funny for the most part with a few decent scares as well  no need to be afraid  catch this one on the big screen and stay after the credits 
Jun 29 2016,negative,original ghostbusters had some scares this reboot had zero scares and dull comedy  if you think the boss was funny then this is for you      if your looking for a something like the original ghostbusters with some tasteful comedy and story then wait until someone else makes a sequel  sony is after your money and is nervous about this one flopping  but it deserves to a flop
Jun 29 2016,positive,haters gonna hate but honestly it was hilarious
Jun 29 2016,negative,with leads who have little to no chemistry a clearly feminist message by making all the men stupid and jokes that usually rely on a reference how loud a person can scream or how someone gets hit between the legs ghostbusters 2016 is nothing more than a crap sequel that will be quickly forgotten  get over it
Jun 29 2016,negative,the movie couldnt decide it it was a remake of the original a reboot of the franchise or a sequel to the scary movie series    the visuals were meh the ghosts could have been very scary had they not used that awful black light glow instead of being scary they look cheesy and like extras to the 2002 scoobydoo movie    the acting was a mix bag   melissa mccarthy and kristen wiig were half the time very good but the other half it felt like they knew they were in a bad movie and phoned in their performance   kate mckinnon who i thought i was going to love as she was the only one who looked like she belonged in the ghostbusters universe came off unfunny random and very very annoying  leslie jones was great the highlight of the movie  chris hemsworth while he funny he was also really dumb and that got old very quickly  everyone else eg mayor fbi school faculty awful they all felt like characters out of a spoof movie like scary movie or worst epicdisaster movie    the movie literally gave me a headache after the first 30mins  it was bad with no direction no build up no character development the chemistry between the characters was pretty much nonexisting and the movie felt like half of it was left of the cutting room floor it was just jumping all over the place    could this movie have been saved maybe unlikely maybe had sony and paul feig worked with the ivan reitman  dan aykroyd and listened to the fans instead of ignoring them and doing the whole fake sexist campaign against them maybe ghostbusters 2016 could have been a hit and rung in the return of a beloved series instead of tarnishing it and setting it back 10 years
Jun 29 2016,positive,the cast worked fine together and gave good laughs and the ghosts there great too  that set the movie down was the died spots like when they talked to kevin and martin in the office for the most part office times where boring
Jun 28 2016,negative,ghostbusters 2016 doesnt understand what made the original special and even fails to be entertaining on its own merits by constantly trying to emulate the original while failing wiigs and mccarthys characters come across as bland compared to their usual roles mckinnons is annoyingly weird jones character is a straight up racial stereotype the only character that works most of the time is hemsworths but its not enough to save this movie the plot weak and uninteresting something that seemed to have been haphazardly thrown together for the movie rather than something crafted with care so much so in fact that the movies own self contained logic gets thrown to the wind at points the original ghostbusters made the implausible seem plausible and took an absurd premise while playing it straight ghostbusters 2016 takes cartoonish characters and inserts them into a poorly written plot with lowest common denominator penisvaginafartpiss joke humor id be ashamed to show to my kid    verdict this movie is neither worth a watch at the theaters or even an eventual rent if you need ghostbusters stick to the original
Jun 28 2016,negative,horrible from beginning to end
Jun 27 2016,negative,a completely unnecessary remake much like the other failed attempt at a summer blockbuster in independence day resurgence   its hard to find one thing from the previews that would make me want to see this except chris hemsworth but i have to ask why is he in this  maybe its for the paycheck  i just hope the unnecessary and in some cases ridiculous remakes stop altogether
Jun 27 2016,negative,had really boring parts its your average action movie did not do anything different from the originals exept make it worse and switch the genders chris hemworth was funny but the rest of the movie was not funny
Jun 27 2016,positive,ghostbusters    well that was a huge surprise absolutely loved it ghostbusters 2016 was a total ride i have to be honest im a bit shocked on how good it actually was it absolutely has to be seen in 3d the whole experience is designed for 3d viewing with many effects of the spectres and ghostly apparitions coming out of the screen into the theatre the ghostbusters cast really have a good time and the film flows well from start to finish chris hemsworth is a revelation as kevin the dull but hot receptionist and is really quite funny the effects are superb with some great nods to the original film some superb cameos from the original cast and ghosts make sure the nostalgia button is firmly pressed the film captures the essence of the original and adds a fresh lick of paint on the whole thing the fx and visuals are flawless and combined with the 3d are a treat for the eyes great end of credits scene set things up for a sequel and if that happens ill be first in the line great fun
Jun 27 2016,positive,ghostbusters is a nostalgic treat and boasts a decent amount of laughs from the new crew the movie however just isnt fun or inventive enough to even come close to the original
Jun 26 2016,positive,funnier and more technical than the original slightly less climatic but still worth seeing
Jun 26 2016,positive,i actually really liked the ladies being the ghostbusters in this remake every single one of the ladies was hilarious
Jun 26 2016,positive,so far ghostbusters is my favorite movie of 2016 it was really funnygets really serious when it needs to and gives the entires team a chance to shine i liked the design of the ghoststhe chemistry between the girls and overall their personalities that may be really humorous but essential to the storythe first hour is good the last 35 minutes are totally badass ghostbusting and action sceneryghostbusters succeds in what it tries to be and coulndt have been made better thanks to paul feigkate mckinnonkristen wiigleslie jones and melissa macarthy
Jun 26 2016,negative,just watched this on tv thank god i didnt spend money to see it because its total garbage
Jun 26 2016,positive,very funny i dont understand why its getting such terrible reviews
Jun 26 2016,positive,screw all the haters whats wrong with putting women in the lead roles it wasnt as good as the 1st one but what is
Jun 25 2016,negative,was not too good should have put rihanna or mila kunis in it was very disappointed dont waste your money effects were okay bad acting though we almost fell asleep please dont see this movie
Jun 25 2016,positive,i wanted to see this while it was in theaters but didnt manage to so i got the dvd  it was ridiculous enough to be charming in its own way  not bad at all
Jun 25 2016,negative,i would say that the film was lame and i was to blame to watch it but the only reason i elected to see it was because of two things chris hemsworth and melissa mccarthy those two actors did not disappoint during the entire duration of the film the introduction of hemsowrths character when he first comes onscreen was hysterical  overall chris  melissa exhibited equallydevoted humor to the movie i was slightly disappointed that i did not laugh as much as i expected or wanted to the other 3 ghostbusters were funny but not nearly as funny as mccarthy the character of jillian was the next best funniest and then erinand finally patty in this order i cannot say anything more about the film but that i was not excited to see it but wanted to give it a chance it is entertaining mildly entertaining it keeps your attention but it lacks the power and illumination that the trailer had in conclusion i feel that this was on ok film it is not a movie that i would be rushing out to see it may be int he top 5 this opening weekend but i am certain that it will not sustain in the top 5 in the next week to come a sad truth that will haunt us forever lol
Jun 25 2016,negative,awesome loved it it made me remember that i love ghostbusters aintfraidofnoghost
Jun 25 2016,positive,its so dang good i saw it twice in one night its not the original and nothing will ever compare to it but this movie is a close 2nd and take it from a die hard ghostbusters fan that i am
Jun 25 2016,positive,i love this damn movie its so much fun
Jun 24 2016,positive,it was good d very funny
Jun 24 2016,positive,the cameos were the best part but no rick moranis the intro was actually kind of scary a nice change
Jun 24 2016,positive,funny great movie however i am surprised there was no recap or cameo appearances by the original cast other than bill murray
Jun 24 2016,positive,fun and new girlpower energy but doesnt quite live up to the spirit of the original thanks for the cameos though dont be afraid to enjoy it
Jun 24 2016,negative,absolutely cringeworthy jokes fell flat horrible writing and a horrid cast i really tried to like this but i guess it just wasnt my cup of tea when ya gonna call someone else
Jun 24 2016,negative,stupid fem bitch crap
Jun 24 2016,negative,the app wont let me put 0 stars in the films defense i did enter the theater with a negative attitude about the forced feminist remake and thought it would match up about as well as the wnba compares to the nba it definitely did not disappointboth fall extremely short of the original and are unwatchable
Jun 24 2016,negative,a pathetic attempt to remake a good movie that didnt need to be remade   trying to make a movie based off an actress who was good in one movie and an idea that was good 20 years ago leads to a huge flop
Jun 24 2016,positive,as a huge ghostbusters fan for as long as i can remember i was at first thrown off by the idea of a rebootbut this movie was awesome got to see it twice already this opening weekend and it made me feel like a little kid all over again this movie is a fantastic ghostbusters movie and the cast was just brilliantly hilarious cant wait to see it stand the test of time like the originals
Jun 24 2016,positive,im not sure where all the negative reviews are coming from this was hilarious
Jun 24 2016,positive,interesting characters cool technology and doesnt take things too seriously even when the sky opens up i hope they make a sequel
Jun 23 2016,negative,kate mckinnon and chris hemsworth are entertaining but this is an otherwise average film not that bad but not good either i guess i watched the extended version it felt too long  with unnecessary scenes whatever they cut out probably should have stayed out so many moments that turned out to be irrelevant to the plot how could they not tighten up a script thats been delayed this long
Jun 23 2016,positive,much better and funnier than expected
Jun 23 2016,negative,one of my friends wanted to go so i got dragged along to this i totally expected to hate this from the getgo  imagine my surprise     this movie is dumb in fact i found it to be incredibly stupid  there were many moments in this movie where i was scruched down in my seat cringing with how bad i found the plotscripthumoreffects to be  but kate mckinnon was entertaining as crazy as hell holtzman and chris hemsworth was surprisingly fun as the thick as a brick receptionist kevin  and unbelievably i didnt totally hate wiig or mccarthy but i cant recommend this film     although its not the total abomination the trailers make it out to be there are way too many lapses in fun or entertaining spots for me where this movie drags  and for me it dragged a lot  but judging by the laughter that surrounded me in the theatre there were enough people who liked it
Jun 23 2016,negative,your careers are ruined
Jun 23 2016,positive,loved it these girls were about to fill those big shoes the haters are going to still hate even without seeing it let em
Jun 23 2016,negative,really did not care for it i felt the humor was shallow compared to the original movie
Jun 22 2016,negative,nobody asked for this
Jun 22 2016,positive,funny and stands on its on
Jun 21 2016,positive,not terrible despite negative reaction from some but not anything special thought leslie jones and kate mckinnon were the better of the four was a real cgi love fest and again it wasnt anything spectacular i hope they dont try and do a second one as i dont think it is worth it leave it as is at this point also enjoyed seeing pretty much the entire old cast
Jun 21 2016,neutral,ghostbusters 2016 is actually more entertaining than i expected it to be loved all the cameos by the stars of the original movie and kate mckinnon is fabulous throughout the film as one of the new ghostbusters
Jun 21 2016,positive,i was very skeptical about this movie but was impressed with the story line and comedy of the girl ghostbusters they did a great job blending in cameos from all the former guys sprinkled from beginning to end     story line is different than original and special effects very improved  i enjoyed and laughed my ass off very glad i went
Jun 21 2016,positive,i liked that they did not try to copy the original script from script and the cameos were fantastic but ghosts not scary and boring
Jun 21 2016,positive,ill rather ghostbust the movie than the ghost itself
Jun 21 2016,negative,cannot believe what theyve done to one of my favorite films of all time even the shitty sequel is better than this poorly thought out cashcow you people fucking suck if you like this go watch the original and eat your own words
Jun 20 2016,positive,i really dont understand the hate for this movie i actually really enjoyed it not as good as the original but was a good add on to the franchise lots of good laughs
Jun 20 2016,negative,extremely disapointing and boring
Jun 20 2016,positive,ghostbusters is not as original as you would like it to be but it still has a hilarious cast and some marvelous ghostbusting action in the mix
Jun 19 2016,positive,such a great movie loved every minute
Jun 19 2016,negative,sadly the movie was worse than i thought it would be it was boring it wasnt funny and the effects were terrible plus the title is spot on ghost busters because they bust exactly one ghost in the entire movie
Jun 19 2016,positive,much better than the rumours and haters want you to believe has some real funny moments a few nods to the originals but mostly just a fun movie that doesnt take itself too seriously much like the original great movie very much worth 2 hours of your time
Jun 19 2016,negative,let me start off by saying that the idea of this movie is actually pretty interesting an all female ghostbusters crew continuing the legacy of the original team that sounds interesting sure it may not be necessary but it still sounds good so when sony takes that idea and executes it into a movie do they make it as good as i predicted absolutelynot sony decided to take a very important piece of my childhood and turns it into a generic stupid and at some points sexist piece of crap that comes complete with a rehashed story that relies more on mostly juvenile humor and unfunny gags and failed attempts at trying to be hip and cool with the young kids rather than actually telling a story visuals that are cheaply made and unrealistic and cast of characters where only one of them is likeable while the rest of them are just flat out unbearable and push the whole girl power sexism crap especially on chris hemsworth just watching this movie alone made me cringe so hard to the point where i was praying that the movie would just end to see these idiots turn something that i watched as a child into a cashgrabbing piece of crap is flat out insulting unless your a major fan of ghostbusters or a kid that would somehow enjoy it i highly advise that you stay as far away from this movie as possible if you choose to watch this i must warn you nothing will prepare you for the insanity that ensues the only things that i will remember from suffering through this god awful piece of torture is the agony and the feeling that i had been insulted congratulations sony youve once again successfully ruined a piece of my childhood and i hope you enjoy doing that for the next few years cause eventually youll get whats coming to you    story 110  visuals 410  characters 210    final score 210
Jun 19 2016,negative,10172016 a good cast but not a good movie this flick could have done better if it was a sequel instead of a remake doing a remake of the original was a horrible idea and very unnecessary i dont think i lold even once
Jun 18 2016,negative,when the best you can say of a film is that it was not as bad as the trailer suggested the production has two problems bad movie and bad trailer choices     the missus wanted to see it so i went it was not as dull as i was expecting it was just stupid the start of the story was ok the production values and cgi were superb but the rest of the story was crap hollywood is once again substituting effects for plot doesnt work good stories dont need great effects great effects do need a story    in addition this was not a comedy it was a drama in which a few of the characters attempted brief standup routines the jokes rarely had anything to do with the plot or the characters it looked like they were added afterwards
Jun 17 2016,negative,why would you wantn to kamje this movie  the gfierst one owas amaxizng ist is mgoing tio mbe rerrible   whom qould ever see thuis mioviiieeeee i saw the trauler and the acasting was terrible an d them joke werent funnty aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhbhh  ii wopulod evger reccommensx thwe mobvi3e to mmanuyone  why wouldm you do this1111 im listen to deatrhnote while doing this thuis movie is rasciost how come the only black woman is ther nopt swmart one thie actors aee annnoying i hate hater this mpcvier  wehyyyyyyyyy haqte haten tyhus movie

Jun 16 2016,positive,hilarious and original i dont see why people are hating it so much it was a good comedy with lots of laughs
Jun 16 2016,negative,this movie was 105 minutes of cringe terrible stereotypes are reinforced throughout and the dialogue is utterly disastrous
Jun 16 2016,negative,im still going to call bill murray if i see a ghost
Jun 16 2016,positive,entertainingmy 11yr old loved it
Jun 16 2016,positive,that is not the worst movie ever
Jun 16 2016,positive,better than the original
Jun 16 2016,negative,i really wanted to like it but this should have been 100x funnier felt like every joke landed flat poor writing for a talented cast sad
Jun 16 2016,negative,the trailers did not convinced me that this will be a good adaptation but i was really hoping that in the end i was wrong and the movie will be as entertaining as dan aykroyd said it is    but nope i might have chuckled a couple of time but i did not actually laugh  at the end of the day it was a chick flick
Jun 15 2016,negative,boring boring boring not funny and super estupid shame
Jun 15 2016,neutral,some laugh out loud moments but lets not get carried away by saying it compares to the original series on any level
Jun 15 2016,positive,a funny and enjoyable movie i havent laughed out loud at a movie for a while but i did so a fair few times with ghostbusters my kids thoroughly enjoyed it which is great  it means my kids get to understand what makes ghostbusters so special the movie provides nice and reverential nods to the original and i thought it was well balanced in that regard some of the set action pieces needed a bit more work and the finale was a little underwhelming but all in all a great movie that im so glad was enjoyed by all in my family
Jun 14 2016,positive,absolutely brilliant i loved it more than the original so funny
Jun 14 2016,negative,i cant wait to not see this movie
Jun 14 2016,positive,this was a great adaption of the classic movie and i loved it a lot great effects great plot line and overall great movie you sexist jerks are just mad that theyre girls and not boys women are funny deal with it
Jun 14 2016,neutral,an ok movie at best wait for the bluray to go on sale
Jun 14 2016,negative,so now its ghostbusters not ghostbusters 3  and ethan dabbs really needs hooked on phonics
Jun 14 2016,negative,my god this looks awful
Jun 14 2016,negative,this movie was a big queef
Jun 13 2016,negative,i outright refuse to see this movie of all the trends in hollywood these days sonys particular brand of scandal marketing is by far the worst films like the interview and the brothers grimsby have garnered extra publicity through false sociopolitical rumors   for this film sony took an uglier youre either with us or youre against us approach by playing on its allfemale lead cast as a sort of backhanded feminist statement innocents like cinemassacrecoms james rolfe have been lambasted and labeled sexist for making the simple declaration that they have intentions not to see the movie based on their initial reactions to the trailers  if this is how sony chooses to advertise their films then ill gladly share the labels and slander by avidly choosing not to see this or any other sony pictures release
Jun 13 2016,positive,this movie seems very interesting the first ghostbusters was good so maybe this one will be better
Jun 13 2016,negative,not even a rotten tomato review is enough to describe how awful this movie really is  its really that bad  i watched it to see if it proves me wrong but it didnt  full review coming soon
Jun 12 2016,positive,ghostbusters is better than the original ghostbusters it is more entertaining it has tons of more action and it is even more hilarious than the original ghostbusters i did like how all the original ghostbusters and the original receptionist made an appearance in the new movie also lets not forget chris hemsworth who played an hilarious receptionist amazing remake two thumbs up i would suggest this movie
Jun 12 2016,positive,fun great homage with some sharp comic timing from mccarthy and wiig
Jun 12 2016,negative,it didnt have the humor that the original movie had kevin is always hitting you in the face with how stupid he is to try and make you laugh when really it gets annoying the cast is good but some of the jokes come off bad
Jun 12 2016,negative,trailer just looks flat no humor to it  it the trailer is dull then the movies has to be even duller
Jun 11 2016,negative,i wish i could give the star a 1 but 12 star is as low as itll let me go
Jun 11 2016,negative,dont waste your time or money to go watch this movie
Jun 11 2016,positive,with the expectations being very high for a reboot on ghostbusters it comes to a main question on does it live up to the original the new casts with a female ragtag group like melissa mccarthy kristen wiig kate mckinnon and leslie jones taking over the ghostbusters seems like a risky move director paul feig who has helmed several comedic films and never failed at trying to make his movies entertaining took the control and handled ghostbusters just well ghostbusters is a lot of fun the cast is lovable and the films visual effect is pretty neat  the reboot may not live up to the original compared to the cast the humor it had for its time the new ghostbusters is quite entertaining in its own way it does pay homage to the original like having a few casts making a surprise cameo has some references like the main villain shaping into an idea someone was thinking about     i was skeptical about ghostbusters being rebooted with the new casts i think paul feig was able to transitioned the concept and making it a whole lot of fun of seeing these new characters the film knows that it is not trying to be better than the original it tries to be its own thing the humor has been updated and is quite hilarious especially seeing melissa mccarthy kristen wiig kate mckinnon and leslie jones bring everything to the table even there receptionists kevin chris hemsworth it is a small role seeing him playing an idiot of a character is comical and the highlight of the movie as well every time his character appears it is hilarious seeing him playing a fun character       the action and visual effects are also updated compared to the original the films third act does feel like they are trying to go with a bang with lots of visual effects being big and loud also including a little updated version of the ghostbusters theme was also a fun nod ghostbusters is a whole lot of fun a good start for a reboot on the franchise which it knows that it cant compete against the original but live on its own with a lovable cast
Jun 11 2016,negative,terrible film made only to sell ecto cooler and  twinkies 0 artistic integrity and not funny
Jun 10 2016,negative,this wasnt funny and it also wasnt scary  the effects were overdone  the characters were poorly written and then over acted  the gags were awkward juvenile and uncreative the story didnt flow very well  the cameos were tacky  overall it was just a bad movie  it is one of the worst movies ive ever watched
Jun 9 2016,positive,the movie was great ignore the internet rage rotten tomatoes might want to get rid of their audience reviews if so many people are going to abuse the privilege
Jun 9 2016,negative,saw this movie early and it is not that bad at all like people are claiming to be shit although it does have its flaws with a few underdeveloped plot lines and insight behind the 3rd act overall it sure as hell beats the original
Jun 9 2016,negative,a movie studio manufactured its own sexist propaganda with either an already existing agenda set in place or in a panic to cover an embarrassing blunder of a film but either way the movie itself falls completely flat feeling phoned in on every front
Jun 8 2016,negative,big steamy pile of poooooo
Jun 8 2016,positive,fun movie of course it wasnt as good as the original but id watch a part 2 loved the nods to the originals
Jun 8 2016,negative,pretty big disappointment some occasional laughs but a pretty big failure
Jun 8 2016,positive,rick moranis is in it  that alone is worth 5 
Jun 7 2016,negative,second worst movie of all time worst remake ever 
Jun 7 2016,positive,best ghostbusters movie
Jun 7 2016,negative,this literally was not funny at all  unfortunately  they chose to actually just redo the original movie  why not do some sort of sequel  just terrible on so many levels
Jun 6 2016,positive,people are judging the movie before they even see it are u kidding me the real story is that the movie has an entertaining story with great actors and charming characters
Jun 6 2016,negative,its a tough thing to reboot retool reimagine or whatever they call it these days a franchise especially one as beloved as ghostbusters even though lets be honest it really was only one great movie one pretty crap one and a topnotch animated series so franchise is a term i use loosely  i admired the balls to not only make another ghostbusters but to make them all women its truly inspired its a shame then that the movie feels so lazy are you a reboot is this the same movie but with different dressing how things come about are very similar to the original but this occasion the events are caused by a sad little man who is apparently smart as fuck and quite the doodler  i really liked the first 1015 minutes or so it had a ghost some smart humor some low brow humor gave us some character stuff the after that it grabs you by the hand and says oh is that the time here is a bunch of stuff happening dont question it just go with it hi kevin nope dont ask about the equipment were just that good well holtzmann is never mind and heres slimer  oh yes kevin he was funny sort of a bit hit and miss with the stupid at some point you think how are you alive funny moments are had with the way the ghostbusters act around him sort of but they are also somewhat contradictory    the idea was good the casting soso the trailers were terrible the marketing was poor the movie pretty bad oh but i wanted to like it soso much really i was rooting for this movie to be at the very least bags of fun a joyride a funfilled special effects bonanza that took advantage of this opportunity to put women front and center its not really fun or funny enough the effects are somewhat cartoonish as for this being female led that was fine i was hoping this would be a game changer but its just fine they did ok its not the female casts fault the movie is a tad bland its the director and editors in my opinion holtzmann had moments that should have been funny but seemed to happen at the wrong moments in the scene i wish a bit more care and attention was spent tightening up the effects and jokes its on the precipice of being an enjoyable romp but i cant do it i didnt hate it which is weird im just disappointing  i give it one start for balls and another for the 3d
Jun 6 2016,positive,saw a screening last night not as amazing as the original but better than ghostbusters 2 my god this movie was so entertaining
Jun 6 2016,positive,funny enterntaining and good at many moments of this movie but as a reboot the movie is less than it was better than the original one
Jun 6 2016,positive,this movie is great these ladies deliver on every level
Jun 5 2016,positive,i cant all of you are a bunch of hater this looks like a good movie
Jun 5 2016,positive,really enjoyed this especially the cameos 
Jun 5 2016,positive,this film could have been improved on for example the cgi and the comedy could have been better and the chemistry between chris hemsworths character and the ghostbusters could have been closer but this is a fine fun time at the movies
Jun 5 2016,negative,its a reboot of original an thats not worth the seeing it should have been a future versions and the original ghost busters the fathers and grandfathers title ghost busters the next generation
Jun 5 2016,positive,i really enjoyed this movie it paid homage to the original and was a fun movie to see i thought it was too scary for the little kids one parents brought it was lots of fun for me and my group though
Jun 5 2016,negative,why would they even make this film im sorry for all involved
Jun 4 2016,positive,glides by on the chemistry of its leads very very funny and good enough to be remembered on its own merits
Jun 3 2016,positive,talented cast and some very funny moments i liked this film i enjoyed most of the characters and i loved the humor but it had an awful plot and some stupid lines i know that this film was a little bit corny but i enjoyed it despite its flaws i recommend this film and it will entertain you for a few hours
Jun 3 2016,negative,bad writing coupled with lackluster acting wth did the critics see in this film or were they paid to give it decent reviews dont waste your money folks its worth a rental at best
Jun 3 2016,positive,absolutely loved this movie as a kid i grew up with the original movies and the cartoons this movie managed to incorporate elements from both as well as a few thing from the recent comic books which i highly recommend   this is a great film to just have some fun for two hours
Jun 3 2016,negative,why on earth is this even a movie why was this even madeseriously easily one of the worst reboots of all time i dont hate it because female leads i hate it because it sucks
Jun 3 2016,negative,i was really hoping this movie would exceed my expectations but unfortunately it met them so poorly written and executed this ruined the franchise for me one good note cgi and cameos were cool the characters were well cast except for chris hemsworth
Jun 2 2016,negative,kate mckinnon is the jar jar binks she is much worse than jesse eisenberg as luthor wiig has no emotion or expressions the entire movie and mccarthys voice is nails on a chalkboard they have no chemistry character development and a big case of green screen blues leslie jones is perfectly fine and chris hemsworth is funny the villain is really lazy and uninteresting and the ghosts are generic and lame awful hiding behind the term misogyny is a cop out this movie sucks
Jun 1 2016,negative,the movie has left an ugly mark on the ghostbusters franchise similar to when a dog drags its bum across the floor
Jun 1 2016,neutral,i was not expecting much at all from this movie while it is not a great or even a good movie the four leads do well and keep it from being the complete disaster i expected  the trailers do them no justice at all   the failures of this version of ghostbusters does not fall upon their shoulders that lays in the arrogant uncompromising  ones of paul fieg and his co writer    they chose to remake a classic without any input from the previous creative minds of the original  fieg shows in this film he is more suited for smaller parody movies and not a large scifi effects film as this the direction of the large set pieces toward the end show this  the pacing throughput is mixed the editing seems choppy and the rhythm of the jokes is just odd there is no pause for an emotional connection with the characters we dont really know these people and the two main leads are supposed to have bee best friends who split apart but we dont ever feel that connection    this was the failure of the script way too many jokes and most of them fall flat not to mention the pitiful attempt of a villain   best reasons to see the film are the four leads a very funny chris hemsworth and a few cameos by the original cast i wish they all could have been in a much better project
May 31 2016,positive,i thought it was really cute seemed a little long but loved the cameos
May 31 2016,positive,i liked it fun and funny give you the nostalgic feel of the classic movie but not better than the classic
May 31 2016,negative,huge wast of time even the extended cut could not save this film    bad jokes cast that no one can connect with and unwanted nostalgia rammed down your throats proving this film can not stand on its own two feet
May 30 2016,positive,so freaking hilarious
May 30 2016,positive,wow what an effort and challenge to tackle such a cult movie with such precision and creativity it was a perfect balance of staying true to the original story and personality and making it something a little different like the original the humor is spot on and corky i was not aware of the cameos and believe they added a beautiful element and a unique layer of humor go see it
May 30 2016,neutral,paul feig made a good movie and had a superb cast and plenty of money to do it we just wish he had been more inclusive to the originators it cost everyone as it is unlikely kristen leslie melissa and kate will ever reprise their roles as ghostbusters which is sad
May 30 2016,positive,omg the new ghostbusters movie was so awesome and hysterical and so much better than the original one
May 30 2016,negative,no egon spengler it just wont be the same 
May 29 2016,negative,the trailer gave me cancer
May 29 2016,negative,the classic movie old ones are way better
May 28 2016,negative,these reviews are bought and paid for
May 28 2016,positive,i thought it was hilarious i was happy to see the original ghostbusters make cameos i missed rick moranis the story line was fun
May 28 2016,positive,i thought it was a good movie great remake
May 28 2016,negative,i recently saw the trailer and i gotta say its going to be terrible i mean come on you replaced the original cast with girls thats disgusting also the acting is terrible and the jokes arent funny it looks like a movie made for feminists because the woman never helped on a single movie ugh
May 28 2016,neutral,warning a few spoilers ahead where to begin   oh my what a mediocrity let me start by saying this film wasnt a complete train wreck it just wasnt  anywhere near as good as it could have been     casting 45 pretty well done i dont think there was a character i particularly felt was out of place the cameos of the old ghostbusters actors were wasted however     storyline 255 distinctly average and predictable i still think a passing the torch storyline from old to the new would have made far far more sense instead we have a film that makes constant call backs to the old giving a painful reminder of just how good the original was  i hardly laughed maybe im just too hard to please but it just wasnt funny  the biggest slap in the face for me though came towards the end of the film when the ghostbusters went from using proton packs to capture ghosts in traps to full on laser weapons capable of blowing them up    cgi and special effects 25 these were up and down like a yoyo with no consistent standard which is a shame as this should have been an easy win    music 255 the revamped theme is tastefully done but the remixed fall out boy effort was awful other themes over the course of the movie were nice tho    all in all the film was average it got somethings very right and others very wrong  its not a bad film just not a great film  i wouldnt rush to see it again but id be tempted to see a sequel if it improved on what was here
May 28 2016,negative,horrible movie  theres not many movies i go to were one guys snoring and 2 random guys walk out halfway through movie lmao
May 27 2016,positive,i actually freaking love this movie kate mckinnon and leslie jones are everything
May 27 2016,negative,im more excited to see this movie flop than to ever watch this pos
May 27 2016,neutral,funny not as good as the original ghostsbusters
May 27 2016,negative,every time one watches a movie or trailer to anything simply ask why why is this happening hopefully one should get their answer
May 27 2016,negative,this movie was so bad
May 26 2016,negative,absolute garbage a travesty
May 26 2016,neutral,the film isnt horribly bad nor particularly good its just mediocre
May 26 2016,positive,i thought it was pretty good  a lot better than i thought it would be  kate mckinnon stole the show and i think she  is who made it enjoyable  i only wish they would have made it a sequel instead of a reboot somehow tied it to the original maybe those who were in it from the first actually play the people they were in the first one overall i thought it was good
May 26 2016,positive,idk why this movie got such poor ratings it was so funny and they did a great job with it i loved the surprises they threw in i would go see this again in a heartbeat 
May 25 2016,positive,everyone from the original makes a cameo except for egon
May 25 2016,negative,i kind of want to see it but i dont like the big black lady and i really dont understand why there girlsi wanted it to be the sons of the original cast sucks  childhood messed up if your going to do a remake do it right 
May 24 2016,positive,omg ghostbusters was amazing to anyone who has not seen it as of yet or might have mixed feelings about it its well worth seeing pacing worked the chemistry is great i was laughing from start to finish i was even giggling at certain other points of the film oh and the cameos  references were not overbearing at all and the villain was not mediocre either hes kind of creepy in his own right best of all are the ghostbusters themselves i give the official nextgen ghostbusters an 8 out 10 go see it guys and bring on the next one please and thank you
May 24 2016,negative,i didnt think that it was god awful but i also didnt think it deserves praise i guess i am just split down the middle my favorite part of the movie was leslie jones character i thought she was the funniest thing of the movie and the part of the movie that i absolutely hated was the villain he was so bland with no redeeming values at all
May 24 2016,negative,this movie is awful not because they are women but because of the fact that it is written horribly the jokes are unfunny the effects look terrible and to top it all off every non female character is a moron dont support this download it for free if you really want to see it just dont waste your money
May 24 2016,negative,this is a train wreak from the start i wanted to give it a shot but this is hands down the worst movie in the world wow was a better movie if you want to waste money just go see world of warcraft movie
May 24 2016,positive,melissa mccarthy shines in every role she takes shes like the meryl streep of comedies
May 23 2016,negative,this ghostbusters is an insult to the hit original that inspired a sequel and a reboot what you should do is dont answer the call find whoever started the idea of this reboot and bring it down to the ocean these women are already fine in their own majorleading movies but bringing them together to star in this ghostbusters movie insults the originals main stars at least some of them made a cameo in this film for once this movie didnt even try to surprise me and it didnt even made me feel like im in the fun compared to the original at least the original movie is filled of fun unlike this wannabejolly reboot dont even bother watching it now i know what you might be thinking why didnt you give this a 6 why thats a very good question everything lovable about the original ghostbusters are either cameos or got taken away from this movie like paper mario sticker star except its worse than that game the game scored a 5 by me everyone is not as lovable as they seem to be in the original movie at least just give men some respect jeez its not like they must be dumb and uncomfortable throughout most of the movie having the most disliked trailer on youtube its only a matter of time before this film gets flamed by a lot of users sorry critics you cant stop me from hating on it saving the world takes melissa mccarthy corny jokes no respect and a lot of fire come on paul feig you produced the peanuts movie and you gave us this thats a big shame of you have at it paul feig and give us a new movie to watch thats great and watchable
May 23 2016,negative,please someone kill me had to walk out of this garbage the only good part was mckinnon who approved this poop way too much cgi could have spent less on cgi on good writers this movie needs to be burned and buried
May 23 2016,positive,effing awesome i just had to mentally block out the papa johns thing why is this in business do people not understand pizza and it was perf
May 23 2016,positive,its just fine nothing more nothing less
May 23 2016,positive,it was an interesting choice to include all of the characters from the first movie as cameos and not acknowledge this happened once before  great movie
May 22 2016,negative,ghostbusters 2016 is a souless remake of the original ghostbusters 1984 movie that attempt to reboot the franchise into a wacky action film with cg effects that fit more at home on a nickelodeon kid game show the attempted adlib acting and jokes feels forced and has no break or change in tempo that makes you part of the ghostbusters world the director has made public statements saying that men are unfunny which shows its flaws in the film as the ensemble cast fails to deliver a memorable comedy film too many actors trying to be comedians jokes made in the original films were complete in character the films high points come when you just forget that its a ghostbusters film which begs the question why they attached an iconic property to this script
May 22 2016,positive,so much fun we loved it
May 22 2016,negative,what a stereotypical money grabber dint waste your money
May 22 2016,negative,as kristen wiig says i thought we could have an adult conversation but apparently we cant so much of the lead up to this films release was posturing from neckbeards and sjws alike is it misandrist not really is it racist no more so than the original is it funny well i didnt think so but if you removed a queef joke and some cursing it would be a great kids movie the cg looks like it came from a pirates of the caribbean video game it didnt seem like any of the actors took the film seriously and that actually works to its benefit paul feig could have cut out all of the useless technobabble and it would have been a decent comedy because so much of it drags behind in obviously unscripted unfunny moments or unnecessarily technical jargon that attempts to fill in for plot details in particular leslie jones could have been funny if they had written any dialogue for her character instead of relying on halfassed nonquips but if you nixed the pop culture references there would be about 10 jokes chris hemsworth steals every scene hes in not that it was too difficult to do despite the fact that he is written as a moron finally some of the shoehorned pandering to the original film and lackluster cameos were just lost in the midst of a seemingly unrefined script overall it was better than ghostbusters 2 because this actually had jokes i cant help but warn you your time would be better spent watching the original ghostbusters or even bridesmaids for that matter
May 22 2016,positive,whats with all the hate yes it is a cash grab every marvel movie is also a cash grab so it has a bunch of feminism doesnt mean everybody has to insult the movie and the people that like it this movie is a troll minefield a lot of people didnt see the movie because of the trailer and they still said it was a bad movie you cant know it is a bad or good movie until you see it if a bad movie can have a good trailer then a good movie can have a bad trailer and what is wrong      with feminism i have a sister so i find it annoying that people are so sexist a bunch of people hate this movie because the ghostbusters are women i dont see anything wrong with that it doesnt even matter     i thought the movie was funny i havent laughed that much since central intelligence watch the movie before saying its terrible
May 21 2016,positive,i really enjoyed this movie for its nostalgia and fun  i loved the original cast was happy most showed up for a cameo but love the ladies almost as much there is another scene at the end of the credits so wait  my daughter and i were the only ones left in the theater to see it i wish theyd used the original gb song instead of the updated version but the movie was fun and they even dedicated it to the late harold ramis which was a touching end
May 21 2016,negative,after seeing the previews who would even want to waste their time or money on this garbage  next
May 21 2016,negative,rt used to actually be a respected review site now it is beholden to corporate money and sjw robots
May 21 2016,negative,saw it at an advance screening its basically an politically driven agenda movie that spews hatred of men the acting is fair to midland but leslie jones ruins every scene shes in she plays a stereotype in a movie thats not supposed to have stereotypes mccarthy is just her usual self no surprise there kristen wig was somewhat ok but nothing special    kate mckinnon and chris hemsworth are the saving grace of this movie but not by much aside from the acting the cgi ischeesy cheap ineffective and of poor quality eddie murphys haunted house movies were of better quality than this    but the ending is where it get s really bad rowanthe male turned ghost turned main villain gets defeated by a nut shot in a film that cries and screams equality its a shame that the underlining message in this fil is that all men are bad and only women are superior    do not waste your time with this film ghostbusters 2016 deserves to be the bomb of 2016 shame on paul feig amy pascal and sony pictures for greenlighting this horrible movie
May 21 2016,positive,cant compare to original but it was very entertaining great cast funny nods to the original and left me looking forward to another it was well worth seeing
May 21 2016,positive,this ghostbusters reboot was actually a lot of fun  much better than we were expecting  its definitely not the same as the originals but i actually count that as a good thing  new story similar theme  also the effects were also quite impressive and kept it fun and exciting to watch  i have to mention that this is the first movie in a very long time that actually has nice looking 3d
May 21 2016,positive,so much fun actually way better than the original well done
May 21 2016,negative,the only good thing about it was when they played the song from the original movie
May 20 2016,positive,i like that they didnt just try to completely redo the original and instead did a little different story line in places and still paid respect to the original  it was humorous and an enjoyable movie
May 20 2016,positive,this movie turned out much better than i expected still definitely not as good as the original because of weaker humor but any ghostbusters fan can try it out but dont expect it to be as good as the original
May 20 2016,positive,this movie is fun there are some good laughs the 4 leads have very good chemistry with one another and there are some cool action scenes worth giving a shot
May 19 2016,negative,i thought it was unfunny so did my gf the racist stereotyping was not funny
May 18 2016,positive,exactly what i was looking for in a ghostbusters movie
May 18 2016,negative,this tomatometer score is so obviously bullshit this reaks of paid reviews
May 17 2016,positive,funniest movie i have seen this year
May 17 2016,negative,nice try sony go back to making terrible paul blart movies
May 17 2016,negative,gets a half star simply because flixster will not allow zero star or negative star ratings  never has there been a movie that deserved to be a flop more than this abomination  had low expectations going in and it was worse than i possibly thought it could be  the studio must have shelled out enormous amounts of money to get the actors from the original to make cameos particularly bill murray  obviously this left them with little money in the budget for writers and special effects  the only time i laughed during the entire film was at how bad the special effects were think directtovideo scoobydoo movie quality effects  do yourself a favor watch the original again and pretend that this reboot never happened
May 17 2016,negative,no im not a big fan of the original ive only seen it once so i think i can give an unbiased review this movie fine in idea is poorly executed the funny version of the ghostbusters lead to being an unfunny mess with a prowomen agenda every male is treated horribly in this movie and some would say that is payback  but it seems to be very noticeable as every males character is unrealistic there are many female characters that are not stupid maybe not helpful but certainly never made one of the assistants dumber than a sloth the movie relies on a lot of humor that i didnt care much about any of these characters even the outsider felt too much for me the most important thing to a movie is the villian the plot and that is a throwaway when you see he isnt very interesting you can sum him up in one word forgettable the battle at the end reminiscent of the original the cameos were crap this idea could of worked if done right but its wasted on the unfunny writing
May 16 2016,negative,practically unwatchable a series of cringe inducing moments one after the other for two straight hours i dont want to jump straight onto the band wagon of hate here i tried to fairly judge the movie for what it is forget the franchise forget the cast this was just a really baaaaaaaaad movie im actually in shock by how utterly horrid it was
May 16 2016,negative,funniest scenes were in the trailers those scenes werent even funny in the trailers
May 16 2016,negative,pretty bad some funny moments but the characters are dull and irritating and the whole story is pretty flat
May 16 2016,positive,it was better than the first 2
May 15 2016,positive,movie is great it has a good story and interesting characters the movie is funny and somewhat scary as well though from the trailers it looks as if it is more or less the same story from the original movie it is not it really isnt which was a good surprise for me i wouldnt pay attention to much of the negative reviews from users here since most of which i have seen have been from people who have not seen the movie and are just angry that the movie got made the movie feels like a ghostbusters movie just not the same ghostbusters that we know just because it is different and it is a reboot does not mean it is not good and should be trashed some reboots and remakes fail miserably and others triumph in my opinion this one triumphs only reason i did not give it the full 5 stars is because i felt the final battle was a bit rushed but just a little if you decide to watch the movie stay all the way through the credits
May 15 2016,positive,just seen this movie i didnt think it was as bad as everyone was thinking it was going to be they had a lot of funny moments the story of how they got started wasnt bad the ghost fighting scenes were pretty awesome i know we all love the original but come on give it a real chance i think you might like it the cameos from the original movie was a nice touch
May 14 2016,positive,special fx were awesome  it was actually pretty scary  some great oneliners  chris hemsworth is fantastic  melissa mccarthy should have been allowed more freedom      i bet the unrated version is going to be better because all of these ladies can get pretty raw and id love to see it
May 14 2016,positive,ghostbusters  i loved the way this movie approach modern audiences and still respecting the previous films nature ghostbusters 2016 is a highly amusing comedy film and a big success of ghostbusters saga brave reboot
May 13 2016,negative,the only funny thing about this movie is that dan akroyd and bill murray signed off on iti guess the living costs in nyc really are so high they needed the cash that bad apart from the bad storyline and poor quality jokes only okay as a purely kids moviein the same league as scooby doo not even the first one but one of the later sequelsa steaming pile of echtoplasmit was a good idea just not planned out in a way to produce a good film im guessing that they just thought making a new ghostbusters film was good enoughwithout giving it any real thought most of the rejuvenation films are like thatremember colin farrells remake of total recallthat film is a war crime and the director should have gone to the hague for trial
May 13 2016,negative,sony needs to get hacked again before this is released so all the copies can be destroyed heads need to roll at sony
May 12 2016,positive,not as much a comedy as youd think  its a decent standalone ghostbusters movie with comedians as the main roles
May 10 2016,positive,this was so much better than i thought it was going to be  i loved it not going to spoil anything but i laughed very hard and it was a great nod to the series  great job hope they do a sequel
May 8 2016,positive,its an ok moviebut because it brought me back to 20 years ago i loved it cool gadgets and some nice cgi scenes plus almost all the original cast made cameos except poor egon spengler
May 7 2016,positive,hilarious the haters are unsurprisingly wrong in my opinion this outing is way more focused and fun than the original i was even able to stand kristen wiig this time never been a fan a couple of scenes jokes dont hit but kate mckinnon and leslie jones steal every scene theyre in be sure to stay through and after the credits
May 7 2016,positive,this movie looked like it was going to be disastrous but it actually was better than i had anticipated in no way shape or form did it live up yo expectations of the original but it was still pretty funny and a lot of fun if you can look passed it being compared to the original it didnt lean too much on feminist jokes and was actually quite clever and funny it just didnt live up to the hype and was a little longer than need be
May 6 2016,positive,this movie was very funny but not that entertaining if you really enjoyed the old ghostbusters
May 6 2016,positive,a worthy addition to the franchise but not as good as the original at least as good as the first sequel
May 6 2016,negative,was hoping this wasnt going to be horrible sadly it was what many expected to be cant really blame the actors as what they had to work with wasnt that great to start the plot was pretty bad and did we really need all that explaination of the logo creation i wouldnt recommend seeng this in theaters but its probably redbox worthy def not worth what they charge for movies now a days watch at your own risk
May 5 2016,positive,fuck haters this movie was awesome went from not even wanting to see it to it being one of the best movies this year
May 5 2016,negative,we waited 30 years for a movie aimed at teenage girls not happy
May 5 2016,negative,lame as i thought it would be it is neither creative or innovative plot was predictable and all the best seems were in trailer you know when that happens it is a crappie movie
May 5 2016,negative,its a mediocre piece of crap just another awful remakereboot
May 4 2016,neutral,would have received a higher rating if the funniest parts werent in the previews  not a bad movie worth watching but dont expect surprises
May 4 2016,positive,this is a super fun movie it gets bogged down a couple times trying to pay homage to the first movie it would move a long even better anyway the leafs are hilarious the writers bring the funny and kate mckinnon sp is a revelation good times all the way around
May 3 2016,negative,looks like a low sad attempt aimed at only making money screw this
May 2 2016,negative,do yourself a favor wait till this comes out on ondemand
May 2 2016,negative,this time i hope the ghosts win
May 2 2016,positive,with a few tweeking here and there  this could be an awesome movie hoping there will be a sequel
May 2 2016,negative,watched the trailer in purplerain movie last weekthis movie is a dud  will not be watching casting is off as is the writing only character that is holding the movie together is melissamccarthy  id suggest pulling trailer and starting over this is not going to do wellstraight to dvd if even that may not help disappointing
May 1 2016,negative,biggest waste of film ever made  theres nothing redeeming to this film at all  all the men are either evil or stupid  no sexism there at all  avoid this movie at all costs
May 1 2016,negative,this looks like its going to be another movie with a huge discrepancy between the critics or at least all critics and audiences i honestly didnt know what to expect from this movie the trailers were awful but it seemed to receive positiveish reviews ultimately the story was lame and the characters didnt have the same chemistry as the characters in the 1984 version funny moments are few and far between and the sfx arent much better than in the trailer the villain is literally the ghostbusters logo metaphor
May 1 2016,negative,wish i could give it less
May 1 2016,positive,way better than i expected
Apr 30 2016,positive,ghostbusters is alot of fun exceeded my expectations
Apr 30 2016,negative,just finished watching this turd   it was nice seeing the original cast members make cameos but thats just putting makeup on a pig   this movie was dreadful an embarrassment
Apr 29 2016,positive,ill admit i love the classic ghostbusters but i loved this one too i couldnt help but smile and laugh and i hope they make a second
Apr 29 2016,negative,honestly i was one of the ones that said wait till it comes out i did see it and it was worse than the trailers all the characters where stereotypes the story was a crap retelling and the jokes didnt land put simply this is a cash grab the actors are talented but this has got to be there worst performance
Apr 29 2016,negative,poor excuse of a reboot the idea behind it was sound but sadly lacks the quality of the first ghostbusters movie the lead roles are not only flimsy but just down right rubbish if this film is to target the next generation of followers at least give the actors  actresses the ability to not convey some reality to this clichã c riddled script     if hemsworth was a woman womens rights group would be up in arms    id add how the film concluded but following the rock concert i decided to save myself from anymore rubbish    i hope those who disagree with me enjoyed the film but if you want to save yourself more than 2 hours watch another film with these actorsactresses where theyll do a better job
Apr 27 2016,positive,love it its hilarious
Apr 27 2016,positive,the movie is okay 710 c
Apr 27 2016,positive,funny movie my kids and i love it
Apr 26 2016,positive,i thought this movie was hilarious loved the cast n it was cool that they brought back the old cast as well i liked this one way better than the original dont listen to the haters
Apr 26 2016,negative,such a pandering movie i would prefer to have aids rather then watch this film
Apr 26 2016,positive,fun  funny the characters are great and the cameos of the original cast are hilarious of the effects are great holds up well to the original
Apr 25 2016,negative,only thing enjoyable about this film was the name  it reminded me if a much better film  but i guess that was the point
Apr 25 2016,positive,loved this movie  so many laughs  it was its own type of movie it had good memories of the first ghostbuster series but it is more funny than serious  i really enjoyed it  i want to watch it again
Apr 25 2016,positive,hilarious great movie would watch again
Apr 23 2016,positive,way better than the youtube trailer rating made it out to be  this film paid homage to the original  the 4 leads were amazing and they even had cameos from 4 of the 6 main actors from the original  highly entertaining and a great addition to the franchise
Apr 23 2016,negative,might a well make a sex and the city with men
Apr 23 2016,positive,i thought this movie was funny and had an awesome cast i enjoyed the new storyline surprised it hasnt been rated higher
Apr 23 2016,positive,nothing will ever surpass the first one but this movie holds all the working components of what makes ghostbusters fun  the cast really vibes well and the special effects are top notch  i think the biggest problem facing this movie was that once audiences saw it wouldnt be starring the original cast and wouldnt be happening within the same continuity as the characters we all grew up loving a lot of people checked out  but this movie continues the tradition of ghostbusters very well  would it have been more fun to see them picking up where the guys left off 30 years earlier  absolutely but this movie was still fun and delivered a decent result  definitely worth a watch if youre a true ghostbusters fan
Apr 23 2016,positive,an incredibly fun film to see one of the very few i would watch more than once this film entices me to see the original ghostbusters
Apr 23 2016,positive,very funny movie i highly enjoyed it i really dont see why everybody hates it
Apr 22 2016,positive,very entertaining great cameos really stepped up the action and effects
Apr 22 2016,positive,fun silly   love melissa mccarthy
Apr 21 2016,positive,good for a standalone ghostbusters
Apr 21 2016,negative,2012 is 4 years old this year in 2016
Apr 21 2016,positive,i loved this film really funny and really sweet fabulous special effects cant fault it
Apr 20 2016,positive,wasnt bad not the same as the original but good in its own way
Apr 20 2016,positive,despite some overly juvenile jokes early on and some cheesy gags at the end this movie is a worthy successor to the original ghostbusters franchise the science is on point the characters are fairly well rounded the majority of the humor is appropriate for all ages there are plenty of nods to the original including cameos by all of the cast of the first film but the thing that really wowed me was the special effects and character designs the ghosts are beautifully designed and walk the perfect line between frightening and funny they are everything i would expect from a modern ghostbusters movie all in all i thoroughly enjoyed this movie
Apr 19 2016,positive,good fun movie cameos and extra scenes in credits and after credits too
Apr 18 2016,neutral,the movie isnt funny until after all the ghosts get out so youll have to wade through about half the movie before anything funny comes up basically all of the funny parts have to do with chris hemsworth
Apr 18 2016,positive,director paul fieg teams up yet again with melissa mccarthy and a saturday night live line up cast which follows trend of the original 1984 cult classic being a female reboot you try to figure out whos respectably who is mccarthy ramis and wiig murray each character having similarities while still oozing something new     the person who stole the show was snl regular and tv comedy personality kate mckinnon who resembles ackroyds ray only a little more crazier and somewhat crankier to full comedy effect another snl regular joins the team the giant leslie jones who i reckon would make a great celebrity death match for game of thrones gwendoline christie     andy garcia plays the mayor but is nothing like david marguiles mayor from the first and chris hemsworths kevin as an answer for annie potts janine playing a dumber than dumb partially blind and deaf receptionist i think they actually doped him up before takes neil casey yup another writer from saturday night live plays the bad guy nut job whos going around waking all the spooks up i think i preferred it when gozer came to town     its a very similar story with some interesting tweaks for background paying respect to the originals the old famous hook  ladder company 8 building makes an appearance along with ecto1 though missing the annoying yet lovable siren slimer and his nasty appetite and the usual protonpacks with upgrades the stay puff marshmellow man gets a facelift and the cameos are brilliantly placed but no moranis    theodore shapiro does the score but gets sounded out by the soundtrack which is actually a lack of and its been reported ray parker jr isnt happy with missy elliot and fall out boys rehash version theres no mick smileys magic or laura branigans hot tonight     same premise as the original possibly playing to fresh fans this might do what the 84 classic did for us oldies middleaged and should it matter if its an all female cast its funny with some very good moments but unfortunately theres plenty of mediocre comedy that just doesnt hit home its a little longer than the original and it does feel it in parts and the effects are what you would expect theyre good but nothing really mindblowing that we havent already seen before     seeing a lot of hate and low scores and to be honest being apprehensive and a big fan of the originals its a good reboot its a carbon copy yes but how else would anyone expect to make a reboot and the fact the film pays so much respect to the originals and especially with the cameos i find it hard to hate it haters gonna hate and they need to let go its more than 30 years on and yes i was around when the original came out so come on its a not a bad fresh start to the franchise     as bill murray might say yes its true they have no dick     running time 7  the cast 8  performance 7  direction 8  story 6  script 6  creativity 8   soundtrack 5  job description 6  the extra bonus points 5 for the nice little touches nods and cameos paying respect to the originals     66 710    twitter spoileralertrv
Apr 17 2016,positive,pretty great movie not a full 5 blown out of the park but i did find it funny and was entertained throughout the movie
Apr 17 2016,negative,they should have done the movie the way everyone was asking for the original ghostbusters train a new team and pass the torch to them not this steaming pile of shit
Apr 16 2016,negative,as a fan of the original ghostbusters i feel insulted when watching this movie now the idea for an allfemale ghostbusters isnt bad its the execution of the final product that makes it bad the comedy fails the ideas make no sense the product placement is out of this world and it takes the original ghostbusters and it pees all over it with cameos from the original cast and denying anything doing with the original one positive i can give the movie is that the ghosts do kind of realistic but hey it could be worse it couldve been jem and the holograms
Apr 16 2016,positive,very funny with lots of cameos  references to the original film
Apr 14 2016,positive,loved the original ghostbuster cameos
Apr 14 2016,positive,was funny as you would expect really liked the fact that all the original cast has a cameo in the new film
Apr 13 2016,positive,refreshing funny and  brought be back to my youth well done
Apr 13 2016,neutral,captured some of the feel but not quite enough decent flick though
Apr 12 2016,positive,all the parts of the trailer that i hated must have ended up on the cutting room floor  i thought the movie was damn funny with my kind of snark and some witty dialog only complaint is that the ghosts looked like the under lighting of a cholos low rider
Apr 9 2016,positive,wonderful well done comedy somewhat lacking on the horror side in a sense of feeling the creepiness but there were more laughs than the originals
Apr 9 2016,neutral,its a different sort of story wonderful special effects but the story could be better
Apr 9 2016,negative,havent even watched it but got me cancer already
Apr 9 2016,negative,hasnt even come out yet and i already got cancer
Apr 9 2016,neutral,i chuckled twice and that was on the extended cut i suppose thats better than i expected but my expectations were low
Apr 9 2016,negative,you must like this movie or you are a sexist the establishment has spoken
Apr 9 2016,positive,it wasnt as good as the original
Apr 9 2016,positive,ghostbusters 2016 is probably going to go down as the most hated film of my generation from announcing an all female cast to bad marketing fans were tearing this apart from the beginning without giving it a chance there was an unnecessary uproar and many people believed it would ruin their childhood making this reboot somehow an abomination to the franchise even when the film started to gain positive reviews from well respected critics the unnecessary hate continued to get worse see im not the biggest fan of the ghostbusters franchise i do believe its a good film and its a classic but after watching ghostbusters 2 and you still think this franchise is untouchable and too timelessly for remakes or reimaginings i cant agree with you there the film is directed by paul feig one of the better directors of comedy right now and it stars melissa mccarthy kristen wiig leslie jones kate mckinnon and chris hemsworth after years of not exploring the paranormal erin gilbert kristen wiig is a professor at columbia university where one day her book is discovered and she gets kicked out of the academy because of a recent ghost finding at a haunted hotel her interest in ghost as peaked once again letting her reunite with her former partner abby yates melissa mccarthy jillian hotlzmann kate mckinnon and patty tolan lesile jones ghosts start to invade new york once again and its up to the new ghostbusters to save the day   one of the best things for me when they announced the reboot was the cast the cast is an ensemble of some of the funniest comedians working today and they had some great chemistry together together they were smart tough and hilarious even thor himself chris hemsworth was hilarious the jokes were spot on even when the jokes started to fizzle out by the third act the story flows together and visually it is some of the best of the year the ghost look actually scary and they were unique in their own paranormal way the cameos were pretty good besides bill murrays which felt a bit forced   i did have a few problems with the film everything was going great until the third act the third act wasnt bad but the story does fall apart and it drags on a bit even some moments where the story was dull the villain rowan had a very clique motivation and was very tedious until he took over chris hemsworths body i also felt like most of the male characters were either jerks or stupid characters like kevin even when he was hilarious he was an idiot the dean of the school was a complete jerk to the women throwing them the bird from left to right hell the mayor was a jerk to them even after saving the people from the hard metal concert i believe these characters will just add fuel to a burning fire for the people that are against this film and it will just give them more excuses to hate on this film   other than these set of problems i had with the film i believe that we finally have a reboot where it respects the original source material but it also can stand on its own two feet remember to go into this film with an open mind and forget about the naysayers i give this film three and a half stars out of five
Apr 9 2016,negative,it had a few funny parts but i wish i had spent my money to see the bfg instead
Apr 8 2016,positive,funny and my kids loved it as well   all i want from a family film
Apr 7 2016,neutral,i have loved the ghostbusters since i was a very small child egon ray peter and winston were some of my heroes growing up so i hated the thought of this movie i have to admit it is funny and it is a good movie but it is not ghostbusters this is a modern comedy with a candy coating of ghostbusters on it my issue with this movie is that it doesnt continue the story and doesnt restart the story it just makes a whole new movie and pretends its ghostbusters
Apr 7 2016,negative,this movie is horrible not funny at all they should have never rebooted ghostbusters save your hard earned money this movie is not worth the 10 you pay for tickets trust me
Apr 6 2016,positive,very funny movie the hylight for me is kristen wigg and leslie jones comic performances
Apr 6 2016,positive,really funny movie the whole theater was loling
Apr 4 2016,positive,after 2 movies that did not live up to all the hype batman and superman and independence day resurgence finally there is a movie that does ghostbusters was awesome and a great summer movie great cast effects cameos and story
Apr 3 2016,negative,a complete genderbend of the characters we    ok let me say this it would be great to see female actors that play roles that make you speechless warm hearted honored scared when being the villain being funny is joan riverss job every movie that has an actress playing comedy roles that sets them up in the joke makes them the joke not in a positive way this movie only proves and shall say it wont get pass the 30 marker 4 unattractive women with one hot bod male actor only says there is a standard of what women want peks only difference for the original weavers character was more covered     its a complete redo rather then a learning from your peers that will run every fan to walmart to just but the original movie
Apr 2 2016,negative,do you like nut shots failed jokes in every line of dialogue a rushed story with a cast that doesnt gel how about black stereotypes do you like men to be ridiculed and made fun of do you like nods to a classic that reminds you how good it is and how bad the remake is do you like wasting your time and money then this is for you to sum it up in one word it would probably be meh
Apr 1 2016,negative,well this remake happened
Apr 1 2016,positive,fantastic from start to finish the reboot has its own identity while still paying homage to the original i hope they make more
Mar 31 2016,positive,a solid remake of a beloved movie  the ladies are funny the ghosts look great and the story premise and setting will remind you of the original film  the cameos are all fun from the old cast
Mar 31 2016,negative,a cash grab genderpolitics movie and all around not funny if the trailor is to be believed and with the producer and director behind it
Mar 30 2016,negative,what a disappointing remake they should not have bothered
Mar 30 2016,positive,umm i am a huge ghostbuster fan however this isnt a bad movie and its not a good one either it had a lot of chance but the scripts was lackluster to say the least it was just another recycled movie made to make a buck effects were extremely colorful and i enjoyed them acting was fine character hit in some missed in others and thr laughs were sporadic but they were there it couldve been good but instead it was average and in comparison to the first it missed
Mar 29 2016,positive,i totally loved it  the crudeness was dialed down to a decent level and had me in stitches  these ladies are funny
Mar 29 2016,positive,actually really funny
Mar 29 2016,negative,not even comparable to the real ghostbusters no chemistry between the girls boring  not believable
Mar 29 2016,negative,never going to see this again dont pay to watch this  one good thing did come out of this movie it made me  appreciate the original even more 
Mar 29 2016,negative,dont waste your money
Mar 29 2016,negative,they spent how much on this
Mar 29 2016,positive,absolutely hilarious ignore the bad reviews and go see it really enjoyed it and would see it again
Mar 29 2016,negative,real review here by angry joe   
Mar 28 2016,positive,while i was initially skeptical about a new ghostbusters movie i went into this with an open mind and the intent to judge it based on its own merit im pleased to say that i enjoyed it
Mar 28 2016,positive,pretty good though not as funny as expected
Mar 28 2016,negative,not interested at all bet it will blow big time
Mar 28 2016,positive,not a cool reboot though
Mar 28 2016,positive,it does have bill murray dan akroyd and pattys uncle is winstin zedmore
Mar 27 2016,negative,saw the trailer and it looks like all style no substance  still hoping for the bestfoiled again
Mar 27 2016,negative,i tried i really did try to give this movie a chance despite how bad the commercials made it look the movie was just as bad as the commercials if not worse the movie isnt funny unless you think fart jokes are funny this movie completely trashes the original ghostbusters  dont go see this movie dont go waste your money
Mar 26 2016,positive,possibly the best reboot of a classic 80s movie ever and worth every moment hardly a misstep in the whole thing lots of laughter and fun
Mar 26 2016,neutral,i havent seen melissa mccarthy in anything that i have liked i am hit and miss on kristen wiig     to me this film looks like an attempt to over cgi an excellent source material and attempt to improve it with crude humor     from what i have seen in the trailers this film is a complete pass
Mar 25 2016,positive,same heart as the original
Mar 25 2016,negative,wow is all i can say about this trash  thanks for ruining a great childhood movie
Mar 25 2016,negative,women ghostbusters  get real  way to ruin the ghostbusters franchise
Mar 24 2016,positive,better then the original the theater laughed from beginning to end relationship between the women was wonderful  villain was basically an angry youtube commenter come to life if fact i bet the people who dont like this movie are the angry youtube commenters who either cant relate to a group of women havent see the movie and are hoping it will fail or dont understand a different type of humor my one nick pick was kevin could of had something going for him others then looks but hes like a puppy  dumb but cute hope a second one is coming
Mar 22 2016,positive,not perfect but very very funny and even scary on occasion this reboot doesnt trample on the memory of the original films but exists in its own right and is best when the four superb leads bounce off each other
Mar 21 2016,positive,enjoyable film lots of funny moments and appearances by familiar gaces looking forward to more adventures with this group
Mar 19 2016,positive,i want to be kate mckinnons jill holtzmann like a lot melissa mccarthy leads has her trademark rants  inspirational speeches kirstin wiig keeps it real  is a sport about lots of gross slapstick leslie jones is the expert on nyc  its historyhence its ghosts chris helmsworth is a statueque ditz the villain is another kind of geek who chooses resentment instead of lovethe embodiment of the misogynist gamer but let me stress kate mckinnon her gadgets her cool her winks her daredevilry owns this movie
Mar 19 2016,positive,very funny but some of the ghosts were the same as the previous movie so the storyline could have been more original
Mar 18 2016,negative,everything youre doing is bad we want you to know this  janosz poha
Mar 18 2016,neutral,it wasnt bad but i didnt laugh a lot i thought that the ending was strong the humor just seemed a little repressed considering the people involved also fyi there are scenes throughout most of the credits and one at the end which were pretty good
Mar 18 2016,negative,what a disgrace to the original should have left this alone 
Mar 18 2016,positive,it wasnt that bad different story but its entertaining the original still best  give it a chance     its not boring
Mar 17 2016,negative,one of the things i liked about the original ghostbusters was that the black guy was the sane one the one that was there to react to the other nuts on the team so basically not a stereotype not here here the black girl is a complete walking stereotype its 2016 can we please stop with the racial stereotypes in films already
Mar 17 2016,negative,there are better movies to watch than this heap of garbage ignore it
Mar 17 2016,neutral,i was looking forward to this movie seeing how it had all female cast but was disappointed  funny in parts absurd in others especially the character played by chris hemsworth
Mar 17 2016,negative,i cant believe i sat through this tripe the worst movie ive seen this year without a doubt the critics rating this positively must be mental
Mar 17 2016,positive,funny movie the cast was engaging and hilarious holtzmann is one of the best characters that i have seen in a while the movie has a joyful vibe
Mar 16 2016,negative,it was awful rubbish
Mar 16 2016,negative,if this was a jokeit isnt funny
Mar 15 2016,negative,very disappointing saw it in 3d and was not impressed its not hard to see the decline of hollywood old school style film making and endless remakes due to lack of new and good plots i give it one star for chris hemsworth
Mar 15 2016,positive,the best 3d hell even the best imax ive ever seen take that star wars
Mar 15 2016,positive,loved smiled ear to ear the 3d is some of the best ive seen in a long time i also saw it in dbox and it was worth every penny
Mar 15 2016,negative,complete and utter garbage this is entertainment and i use that term lightly of the lowest denominator the fact that it seems to be bombing restores my faith in humanity
Mar 14 2016,negative,boring unimaginative typical hollywood out of originality corporate garbage
Mar 14 2016,negative,probably the worst slap in the face to a franchise from your childhood ever the jokes are unfunny most of the cgi looks corny and the characters do not hold up to the original im sorry but i do have a real problem with it
Mar 14 2016,positive,its a solid comedy unfortunately just solid it doesnt improve anyway on original and propably will be forgotten in a year
Mar 14 2016,positive,this movie is awesome these ladies have amazing chemistry kate mckinnon and leslie jones need their own gb movie it kills me that this will be the only adventure with this very worthy team of ghost busting badasses
Mar 13 2016,negative,horrible movie the best parts were the original cast cameos and they were terrible
Mar 13 2016,positive,very funny and i loved the cameos and references to the original movie
Mar 12 2016,negative,ghostbusters review reboot alert sorry women you cant do it better just different the script skittered near the original but only at a distance cameo alert as well the references to gremlins poltergeist and nightmare before christmas distracted me the script was not great the acting was horrible the sound and cinematography were exceptional this was the best 3d movie yet not sure what they were trying to prove kinda funny though so ill give it a 35 out of 10
Mar 12 2016,negative,i had no intention of seeing this movie but im glad i did go see it i heard it was horrible the way people were talking about it you would think it was the worst thing ever made it was not it was actually funny i feel like everyone is trying to hard to compare it to the original if you go in and watch it and just dont think of the original i feel like youll have a fun time watching it i actually thought this was better than ghostbusters 2 but thats just my opinion
Mar 11 2016,neutral,when a comedy fails to make you laugh even once you know you failed to set out what you were supposed to do by no means awful it simply isnt a good movie and all the 4 and 5 stars are mostly critics to afraid to say its bad in fear of the feminist attack but im not i will say it proudly this movie is bad not horrible but definitely not good the on screen chemistry is ok and these actors can be funny but they simply dont have the right script here the movie just seems to be in an awkward state of trying to make you laugh but failing to do so wouldnt recommend just rewatch the first or even the second movie to see how to do this premise better 255
Mar 11 2016,positive,it was fun the girls were great  3d worth seeing
Mar 11 2016,positive,in the immortal words of doug e fresh the ghostbusters are back and all brand new
Mar 10 2016,negative,just not funny spent too much time with cgi ghosts and not enough time making jokes
Mar 10 2016,positive,a very enjoyable experience throughout some jokes fell completely flat and pacing was off at some points definitely not the same ghostbusters we all love but still a fun ride
Mar 10 2016,positive,i thought it was hilarious and well made all the actresses were perfect for the part
Mar 9 2016,positive,its hard not to have a great time watching this crew though it does move at a very rapid pace and could definitely benefit from an extended directors cut
Mar 8 2016,neutral,kate mckinnon  leslie jones are horrible in this film either by script or preformances hated parts of the film while i loved some other parts chris hemsworth did an ok job at comedy the smiler ghost scene was good i was glad to see him get the proper special effects treatment the villain was also horrible
Mar 8 2016,positive,it probably helped that id never seen the original ghostbusters upon seeing this one but honestly i just havent laughed this hard at a movie in a while such funny badass ladies and chris hemsworth dancing gives me life
Mar 8 2016,negative,wow killed the franchise with that mess of a trailer   harold ramis just rolled over in his grave rip  please no cameos please no cameos please no cameos
Mar 8 2016,positive,its still incredibly funny even if it lacks the laserlike focus of the original im order to meander down other amusing paths wonton soup anyone 
Mar 8 2016,positive,brilliant absolutely brilliant every aspect was great cast script it was awesome
Mar 7 2016,negative,honestly just utterly disappointing but it was expected i went in with an open mind though maybe just the trailers missed the best parts maybe the leaked script wasnt real maybe maybe maybe but nope its a pointless cashin movie no relationship building pointlessly throwing them all together saying 2 are friends that fell out as if we are supposed to get latched onto them for that reason but between the slapstick and the fanny fart joke i just cringed throughout the movie the cameos where wasted honestly leslie jones was the only actor that felt like she fit her role in the ghostbusters the other 3 where just terrible in this film maybe they are funny and it was just the script and direction but i would know having not seen them outside of this film the cgi was on par with scooby doo over the top and too bright it feels like paul feig watched an episode or two of the animated series and then decided to copy as much of the popular stuff from the overall series into the film for the sake of nostalgia but missed what was actually nostalgic about the film over the top unfunny badly written and cgi that belongs on a low budget kids tv show
Mar 7 2016,negative,ghostbusters provides quite a few laughs and two surprisingly fresh performances by kate mckinnon and leslie jones in contrast the pacing often drags theres too much techno babble and a lot of the jokes fell flat most notably ghostbusters fails to justify its existence instead of doing something different with its very fun premise it tries to recreate the original film with few tweaks here and there while borrowing many elements from it much of the human and ghost cast is here in uninspired cameos ultimately the new rebooted ghostbusters isnt offensively bad the same cant be said about much of the controversy surrounding the film its rather a disposable and largely unimaginative comedy thats not nearly as fun as it should
Mar 7 2016,negative,the only good thing about this movie is the visual effects the story the acting the scripts are crap way to ruin a classic
Mar 7 2016,negative,this is a very mediocre film that honesty is kinda boring and the best part of the whole movie was chris hemsworth
Mar 6 2016,negative,after ignoring the haters and my usual distrust of anything that comes from a critics mouth i went into this movie with as much of an open mind as i could possibly could ivan reitman produced this movie so how bad could it actually be and the low score im giving this isnt because it was bad its because it was meaningless    if sony wanted to reboot one of the treasures of the 80s and lets face it there really werent that many of them then they should ensure that the essence of what made it special is captured for the new generation weve seen this work with star wars the force awakens jurassic world and im told star trek weve seen this fail with anything zack snyder dwayne johnsons hercules the lone ranger and now ghostbusters    the original ghostbusters blended heart humor and action to a degree that wove an intricate pattern of thrills and laughs it was brilliantly cast wonderfully directed and stands the test of time  the new version is brilliantly cast its everything else that goes to crap while you have 4 truly funny women they didnt make me crack a smile once how is that possible how can they have left the funny so far away that kristen wiig couldnt make me chuckle inconceivable    then we take the role of kevin played by chris hemsworth if the gender roles were reversed this would be called misogyny but since its a guy its hilarious right pretty faced dimwit blonde  comedy gold the two main female roles in the original ghostbusters featured strong female characters in fact the only idiots in that movie were men combine that with the desperate attempt to make us laugh by resorting to one of the worst fart jokes of all time and ridiculing internet trolls and you know youre going nowhere near my funny bone    the heart portion is absolutely forced there was no heart girls got made fun of in high school tell each other ghost stories drift apart and come back im not leaving you again is the closest we get to heart and it feels like it wasnt genuine this whole process felt like a rush to get to the exit rather than creating the interpersonal relationships that make me believe the characters truly care about each other ok ok you had a very awkward toast at the end thats supposed to melt me right or was it supposed to be funny im really not sure    lets look at the villain for a moment weaksauce ghostbusters had gozer the destructor ghostbusters ii scourge of carpathia ghostbusters light had rowan the bullied who apparently is dangerous because he can make people dance badly if thats villainous then im terrifying    i dont put this at the feet of the cast even though the best performances were by the original cast during their all too brief cameos i put this squarely on paul feig as the writer and director you delivered us a lifeless corpse filled with glued together equipment that is more reminiscent of my bad halloween robot costume in 1983 than something that carries the name proton pack    once again critics are foolish they pan tarzan but give this a fresh rating dan aykroyds praise is understandable he needs the money and has a producers credit  sony dont haunt us with another specter of past glory
Mar 6 2016,negative,terrible utterly awful reboot
Mar 6 2016,neutral,a controversial movie for the most unfair and stupid reasons that at the ends have nothing to do with the movie itself i really wanted to like it mostly to support the cast that i thought were pretty spoton it wasnt good the story is not interesting the characters take more time telling jokes than trying to be memorable or relatable and since there are four of them doing that it gets quickly tiring   i find some visuals pretty creative one of the best ghost designs from the franchise im sorry for a movie telling from a woman perspective chris hemsworth was the best thing in it having all the memorable jokes with perfect timing i do love kate in it just for her quirky presence as jillian    i also found some jokes kind of bad taste like killing one of the original actors with absolutely no concerns from the characters
Mar 6 2016,negative,did ony put its minions to work to get this up to 97 want to see 
Mar 6 2016,negative,the chemistry between the 4 leading ladies was good their characters and backstories were great and the technology they used was cool but this movie lacked the most important element in a ghostbusters movie comedy personally i chuckled 89 times throughout the film thats it i never broke out into a full laugh wiig mccarthy mckinnon and jones shine when they improvise dialogue it seemed like there was little to no space in this movie where these talented comedic actors could flesh out the funny the humor in the script was juvenile and fell flat which is the main reason why this film didnt work for me but the good thing about film is that its subjective go and see the film to form your own opinion
Mar 5 2016,positive,it wasnt the original but so what fantastic cast and such an entertaining movie which is what i was looking for holtsman is my absolute favourite
Mar 5 2016,positive,very funny great in 3d
Mar 5 2016,positive,im gonna say it    it beats the original
Mar 4 2016,positive,want to watch this now lol have to wait till summer seen the trailer and it looks awesome
Mar 4 2016,negative,the worst movie ever
Mar 4 2016,negative,phantom menace level disappointment awful in every way it should never have been remade as a slap stick comedy im trying very hard to find a silver lining but am coming up blank  i sniggered a couple of time at hemsworth
Mar 4 2016,negative,one of the most unfunny films i have seen all year i only giggled 3 times the whole movie is almost like it was edited together with all of the bad takes and all the good jokes were misplaced horrible improve jokes and run on gags that dont work its a shame since this director and this cast can make something probably good but it isnt lots of drawn out and over explained jokes if you go in not looking at it as a comedy its just a mediocre action movie unfortunately i tried to not think about the 1984 film and look at this as its own thing but the film constantly reminds me there is a funnier and better made film sitting on my shelf at home with the same name the cameos really threw me out of the movie and was distracting also they were wasted and incredibly unfunny cameos from original ghostbusters the villain rowan is forgetable and completely terrible also the credits make you stay to watch more scenes that add nothing and a deleted scene from the movie there is even a stupid after credit scene to set up a sequel  i really did want to like this but none of the jokes land it was bland and pretty boring big misstep for paul feig id rather watch bridesmaids the heat or spy go see those and avoid this not worth it
Mar 3 2016,positive,i actually really enjoyed this one a lot more than i even thought i would i will admit i was one of the naysayers when i heard the new ghostbusters film was a reboot and not a sequel to the original films of the 80s i enjoy paul feigs previous films so i had no doubt he would handle the comedy well and i had no issue with it being a female led cast i am glad i was proven wrong and what we have here is the start of hopefully another great franchise the film pays homage to the original film in many great ways that i think a lot of the previous fans will enjoy erin gilbert kristen wiig teams up with her ex best friend abby yates melissa mccarthy when she finds out abby published a book they wrote together many years back on amazon erin and abby took separate career paths but after the reports of a haunting at a local mansion the two along with abbys engineering partner jillian holtzmann kate mckinnon who i must say steals every scene investigate the haunting soon enough they discover paranormal activity going on and decide after being fired from their jobs to form the ghostbusters along for the ride as well is patty tolan leslie jones the only one who isnt a scientist but knows the history of new york better than everyone else the ghostbusters soon realize the ghost attacks arent just random but are planned and its up to them to figure it out before all of new york city is overrun the film also stars chris hemsworth as kevin the ghostbusters receptionist who is literally the dumbest dude in the world but absolutely hilarious the movie works on several fronts the chemistry between the four leads is really well done and believable the bad guy is actually pretty decent in this one compared to the older two films also its got a great blend of horror and comedy the only gripe is that it does drag on just a bit about 34 of the way through it would have benefitted from being literally 10 minutes shorter overall as a fan of the originals i was pleasantly surprised by this one and would recommend giving this one a look
Mar 3 2016,positive,ghostbusters is back with a new installment thats more colorful and action packed but not as funny as the original it does a great job at trying to develop its own mythology while still paying tribute to the original film almost to a fault the cast and their chemistry is what allows this reboot to succeed at the end of the day    ps the extended version is slightly better and for the most part well structured
Mar 3 2016,negative,one of the worst movies i have everrrrrrrrr seen
Mar 3 2016,positive,i heard this movie wasnt good so i had low expectations but i wanted to see it anyway because i was a fan of the original and i was curious to see how it differed asides from the all woman cast  it turns out to be pretty good movie i enjoyed it  i thought it was just as good as the original  i thought the cameos by members of the original movies were terrific
Mar 3 2016,negative,the trailer sealed it recycled and boring
Mar 3 2016,positive,haters to the left this is a new spin on an older movie was it entirely successful not entirely name a successful remake seriously you cant still worth viewing still very enjoyable and funny loved all the cameos really hoping for a sequel because they still have a bit of catching up to do in the character development aspect
Mar 3 2016,positive,is it better than the original of course not but when you view it as its own movie its very entertaining and the cast is very funny especially kate mckinnon
Mar 3 2016,negative,what a shit show 110
Mar 2 2016,positive,the movie was awesome why the heck are people hating on it the ladies did an awesome job plenty of scares and laughs well put and scripted the cameos where very funny fine to watch with young kids ignore the racist idiots and haters because its a all women cast loved it made me feel like a kid again it was that fun
Feb 29 2016,negative,more nostalgia than there was a plot nice to see old actors make cameos but wish it hadnt been in such a dumb movie
Feb 29 2016,negative,it was okay i like the original one better
Feb 28 2016,positive,smart and funny   the team works together better than the original team   the fx are on point   and they dont waste all the jokes for the trailers     watch all the credits   all of them
Feb 27 2016,positive,it was decent enough but nothing compared to the original
Feb 27 2016,negative,i wont knock it till i see it that being said im going in with zero expectations of liking it that way my opinion can only get better
Feb 25 2016,positive,amazing movie loved it fabulous stay tell the end of credits 
Feb 25 2016,positive,this beat my expectations a excellent film
Feb 24 2016,positive,i dont understand the rating here its one of the best movie this year for sure
Feb 23 2016,positive,modernization that doesnt reach the potential set by the original taken down by some of the writing and not recognizing it is in fact a ghostbusters remake stale humor holds back an innovative idea
Feb 22 2016,positive,ghostbusters 2016 was never going to match the perfect hilarious brilliance of the original it pays homage to but it still has a very funny cast of actresses having a lot of vivid new fun with the premise of four scientists protecting new york city from ghosts while touching on many of the classics tropes yet whats truly missing is the original casts passion and fascination with paranormal phenomena replaced with their forced cameos
Feb 22 2016,negative,raw cheesy sluggish
Feb 22 2016,positive,not as bad as i heard it would be great casting with surprises
Feb 22 2016,positive,ghostbusters is a totally fun summer experience and i dont think it is looking to satisfy anything but that one of the best theatre experiences i have had in summer 2016 8010
Feb 21 2016,positive,not sure how i feel about this just yet will give it s shot though
Feb 20 2016,positive,standalone this is a fantastic and fun movie from start to finish
Feb 20 2016,negative,leslie jones blows donkey dick never heard of her before this movie never want to see that horrendous pos again
Feb 18 2016,positive,hey its a summer popcorn flick enjoy it for what it is
Feb 17 2016,positive,watched this film today its really good   i would watch it again
Feb 14 2016,positive,better than the original no but much better than the user reviews and previews let on had a lot of fun watching this and loved the cameos
Feb 14 2016,positive,this is how you remake an already great movie
Feb 14 2016,positive,entertaining enough to get by writing should have been better storyline fell apart lots of opportunity but didnt need to be made based on the final result
Feb 13 2016,positive,i thought it was a great movie with wasnt casual shout outs to the original and staying completely its own story the end credit teaser made me excited for the sequel and the comedy was spot on from start to finish highly recommended
Feb 13 2016,positive,definitely undeserving of all the crap it received prior to its release entertaining and funny though admittedly a few jokes did fall flat for me extra shout out here to mckinnon and hemsworth both of whom were particularly great in their roles
Feb 11 2016,negative,wait for it to be on cable then just go to bed its seriously not worth it such a letdown
Feb 10 2016,positive,where was rick moranis
Feb 9 2016,negative,movie was not funny only some giggles here and there overall the movie was choppy and just not fun
Feb 9 2016,negative,only sexist misandrist sjw would love this  no respect for the original source material crass offensive stapstick  the actors are not believable in anyway  need a lobotomy to suspend disbelief for this pile of excrement
Feb 9 2016,positive,not quite up to snuff to the original but still a fun film also lovin the cameos
Feb 8 2016,neutral,could be so much better  also could have been terrible  its just there
Feb 8 2016,positive,could have been a lot better worth a watch
Feb 7 2016,positive,surprisingly ok  not really sure why people are so upset  i have come to the realization that i am not a fan of melissa mccarthys comedy style but she was ok in this film  overall a pretty entertaining and fun flick
Feb 5 2016,negative,horrible  worst movie i have seen in years
Feb 5 2016,negative,i want to see a trailer before i give my thoughts and concerns
Feb 4 2016,negative,i wouldve liked to see less remember this from the original and more originality    ill start with the positives this movie is very funny not consistently not every joke but it is very funny secondly the 3d is the best 3d ive seen done this well since 3d movies have become so common but heres the problem much like chris hemsworths kevin theres not enough of the great things in this movie     much like last years jurassic world this rebootupdate on a classic from a few decades ago is 100 unnecessary many people had a problem with jurassic world saying it relied too much on nostalgia from the original movie well where jurassic world was somewhat subtle with their nostalgia ghostbusters relies heavily on taking material from the original and hoping to please the audience with things that make you go oh thats from the first one i honestly feel like the only reason its receiving positive reviews is because of the cameos lines like thats gonna leave a mark and say hello to my little friend really but dont worry between the paper thin plot line and the cameos theres also time to force in dialogue from the original as well which oddly enough feels like cameos in itself its an ok movie but  much like all the unnecessary reboots including finding dory its also forgettable
Feb 4 2016,positive,day tuesday  date 3 nov 2016  time 1030 pm  with no one  on hdtv
Feb 4 2016,positive,i dont get why people dumped all over this it wasnt the originals but it was fun
Feb 4 2016,positive,not the original but way better than the second
Feb 4 2016,negative,glad i didnt see it ill stick to the original films with bill murray
Feb 3 2016,positive,enjoyable entertaining funny awesome graphics  a lot of fun
Feb 2 2016,positive,i dont care what you aholes think i like this reboot
Jan 31 2016,positive,meh i like the cameos in the flick other than that not much of a lasting impression left a subpar remake
Jan 31 2016,negative,only trailer played during finding dory without 1 laugh lame jokeschemistry feels forcednot genuine some things are best left alone
Jan 31 2016,negative,so much wrong with this movie most of all it wasnt funny
Jan 31 2016,positive,ghostbusters is so great you guys trailers did not do it justice as many dont for paul feigs movies dont listen to people hating on this just because its a reboot its excellent on its own merits its very funny especially kate mckinnon and chris hemsworth theres some dumb fart jokes but those are outweighed by the smarter ones there good references to the original without being overwhelming they even made fun of internet trolls and the villain was basically an mra which was perfect for this movie at this time if you liked the original and arent a douchebag youll probably enjoy the new ghostbusters     45  excellent
Jan 30 2016,positive,i must say nowhere near as bad as i thought it would be the cast does an excellent job of making this stand on its own even as it pales in comparison to with the original was fun seeing the cameos
Jan 30 2016,positive,funny as f go watch this
Jan 29 2016,positive,i really dont know why this movie is getting so much hate it had some  really fun moments plus all the actors were great in their role so go see it and judge it by yourself
Jan 29 2016,neutral,even with a very talented cast ghostbusters cant spit out enough laughs to acknowledge its existence 
Jan 26 2016,negative,who thought it would be a great idea to make this
Jan 26 2016,positive,ghostbusters really is something ghostbusters is one of the best reboots i have ever seen its funny has a good plot and has good characters that dont feel paper thin ghostbusters keeps everything that made the original great and adds new things that the original didnt have ghostbusters gets an a for being a reboot that felt new 9510
Jan 26 2016,positive,wasnt that funny but wasnt really boring
Jan 24 2016,negative,ghostbusters was sad and more than a little pathetic they waste their mvps chris hemsworth and kate mckinnon and push them to the side in the last half of the film super misguided and mediocre c
Jan 24 2016,positive,it a mostly original story and it was fun sometimes too much but overall i had a good time
Jan 24 2016,negative,quite possibly one of the worst movies ive ever seen whether its the shameless product placement or the bland unfunny improv comedy it just flat fails one of the worst gags is about farting out the front a point to be made as to a movie thats being touted as a movie being devoid of sexism for casting females in the titular roles is its quite possibly one the most sexist offensive films ive ever seen men are treated as dimwitted assholes the villain is a nerd fanboy type its as if the studio and filmmakers just wanted to make a film that completely alienates the fanbase and pushes a feminist agenda instead of a message of equality sony and the filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves
Jan 24 2016,positive,yes great revisioning that highlights a great cast
Jan 24 2016,negative,just ok not as much fun as the original jokes were also flat
Jan 23 2016,positive,just like with feiges spy this is a ton of fun you really cant compare this with the original the plot deviates significantly and the humor is an entirely different style if you liked spy youll like this once the movie gets rolling its nonstop laughs frankly i still cant believe how much hate was thrown at this movie before anyone saw it for so many they obviously decided to hate it walking into a theater the simple fact that this movie currently has a lower audience rating than the latest purge movie is evidence enough of that in this case listen to the critics over the fanboy audience this movie may have been the most fun i had at the movies this summer
Jan 21 2016,positive,was not expecting it to be as good as the originals and it wasnt but still a good film in its own rights the characters are fun even if they get a little lost in the third act well worth a trip the cinema for a few laughs
Jan 20 2016,positive,i went to see this with a friend simply because it was a movie i wanted to see but thought i probably wouldnt want to watch again i was wrong it was hilarious left and right i couldnt stop laughing from a mix of stupid jokes slapstick comedy and witty comments sure it wasnt much different the original when it came to the plot but i dont think it was supposed to be super funny and overall a good movie
Jan 20 2016,negative,was really looking forward to seeing this movie until i learned that it was gonna be an all female group i forced myself to watch it anyway thinking it could sway me needless to say  it didnt disappointingly shit
Jan 20 2016,positive,excellent remake of a cult classic    the cast done justice to the film   thoroughly enjoyable would see it again  in fact ill see it just for chris h boogying at the end pop them moves my son
Jan 19 2016,positive,it was better than i expected it wasnt as bad as people said it was going to be the haters are wrong
Jan 18 2016,positive,solid fun funny and a totally worthwhile reboot
Jan 18 2016,positive,although ghostbusters would have benefited more with a brand new story instead of adapting much of the original the chemistry of the cast along with feigs eye for comedic details ultimately leaves us with a funny new iteration of a classic
Jan 18 2016,positive,not as bad as you think so at least give it a chance
Jan 17 2016,positive,fããking hilarious and awesome  gonna see it again
Jan 17 2016,negative,looks like sony has paid off flixter to give this a good review the movie is garbage not one joke is funny its terrible
Jan 17 2016,positive,a lot better than i thought i liked it
Jan 17 2016,positive,not exactly what i was expecting but still a good movie
Jan 16 2016,positive,a very good and enjoyable movie
Jan 16 2016,negative,this movie is going to be one of the biggest flops of all time
Jan 16 2016,positive,not bad not bad at all a little shaky at spots and you cannot help but compare it to the original but i enjoy it
Jan 16 2016,positive,it was cute not as good as the first one but still cute the acting was good the jokes were eh special effects were on key the old characters came back in new spots but it did lack that suspense that the first one had the  were all back but that couldnt even help this film watch at someones else house
Jan 15 2016,positive,lots of laughs but some jokes fall short and the story could of been better
Jan 15 2016,negative,one of the worst movies ever made
Jan 15 2016,positive,its no original but its still good
Jan 15 2016,positive,i enjoyed it really worth a watch some good action sequences with the right amount of humour
Jan 15 2016,positive,i have not seen the original ghostbusters but this remakereboot is pretty solid on its own this version tries to be itself by creating new characters plot and storyline while im sure original is a classic i would say to check this version out sometime
Jan 14 2016,positive,putting woman in doesnt change the fact that its still that ghostbusters is a little enjoyable
Jan 13 2016,positive,this was hilarious it cant have been easy to try this considering the source material is so great i think what people need to realize is that this is a supernatural comedy which is a different tone than the original the original was a supernatural drama with some comedy in it i dont care what the haters say this was an amazingly acted film headlined by brilliant comediennes
Jan 13 2016,positive,went in with low expectations  i was for the most part entertained some really funny moments  the laziest  bad 3d i have seen in years  main complaint was no real memorable ghosts and the possession scenes were meh  the cameos alone are worth going to see this movie
Jan 13 2016,positive,if you can get past all the negativity pre release you will find a really fun film that was able to ensemble a great main cast with kate mckinnon as a highlight and that find its own way to work well with the premises established by the originals a great watch
Jan 11 2016,negative,a bit disappointing i laughed twice tho maybe it was the wrong direction to try and push such a heavy comedic hand
Jan 11 2016,positive,well worth a watch and stay to the end
Jan 11 2016,positive,ghostbusters is an ok movie that most people will hate just for being a rebootthe movie is actually funny which if you saw the trailers is kind of surprising and the acting is quite goodbut unfortunately the movie has a a lot of cameos and when i say a lot i mean a lot of themthey all feel force out of place and badly actedand i almost forgot the movies villain why because he is a stupid and forgettablein the end ghostbusters is a funny entertaining movie that you might like but if you dont i wont blame you
Jan 10 2016,positive,surprised it was so good
Jan 10 2016,positive,surprisingly good
Jan 10 2016,positive,the treatment of men as dumb as a rock eye candy in this movie was rather refreshing
Jan 10 2016,positive,ghostbusters 2016 was very entertaining however as most films these days all the funniest parts are shown in the trailers although i enjoyed it it didnt stand up to the original close but it lacked something the original had which i cant quite put my finger on worth a watch
Jan 9 2016,positive,awesome reboot kind of setting up new franchise not many ghosts caught
Jan 9 2016,positive,all the whiners complaining about an all woman cast and that it wont hold a candle to the old moviesshut up this movie was great total reboot not sure why people flip out over a reboot lots of fun easter egg cameos that make it even cooler great acting music good special effects even better than the originals not surprising go see it
Jan 7 2016,neutral,i have mixed feelings but lets hope this is good
Jan 6 2016,positive,this all female led ghostbusters wont be as memorable as the original but its still a whole lot of fun
Jan 6 2016,positive,entertaining and very respectful of the original with great cameos funny actresses for sure
Jan 6 2016,positive,this movie isnt as bad as what the audience reviews make it out to be the plot is fresh while still having the feel of the original the references to the original movies are fun and well done definitely hope they make another one top it off with great effects
Jan 5 2016,neutral,ghostbusters is the latest of endless reboots to have come out and a film that has garnished unnecessary controversy yes why reboot a classic thats not the problem but choosing to go with a female cast instead is apparently the worst thing ever
Jan 5 2016,positive,after all the controversy and outrage it turns out this movie neither the worst thing ever nor is it as good as i hoped it would be but it definitely is one thing funny its a pretty standard paintbynumbers reboot the story is pretty nonsensical and predictable and a lot of the cameos and callbacks to the original movie fall flat but i love the new team and i really hope they do more of these
Jan 4 2016,positive,before this movie was released i was in the minority i was actually looking forward to this film and when i finally saw it i was very satisfied while it does start out a little slow it does get better and better as it goes along the script is funny and clever the cameos and callbacks to the first film work very well the action scenes are amazing especially in the climax and be sure to stay for the end credits you wont regret it all in all the new ghostbusters does exactly what a remakereboot is supposed to do it keeps the spirit no pun intended of the original without being a shotforshot retelling
Jan 3 2016,negative,i prefer the original 2 but the booey bomb at the end was cool
Jan 3 2016,positive,this movie was sooooooo funny
Jan 3 2016,neutral,did this movie need to exist no does it live up to the original absolutely not but its able to have a decent amount of laughs and some fun action even if the film is a bit forgettable
Jan 3 2016,positive,paul feigs ghostbusters does a splendid job in bringing the ghostbusters franchise back to life with a new talented and humorous cast creative ghost designs and winks and nudges to the original films while standing on its own as an entertaining summer actioncomedy blockbuster thats definitely worth the call
Jan 2 2016,positive,easily one of the most entertaining and funny movies of the year mccarthy wiig jones and mckinnon are all really really funny chris hemsworth is really good in a comedic role great script and fine action
Jan 2 2016,positive,very entertaining funny and excellent performances
Jan 2 2016,positive,i enjoyed the characters a great deal and thought the film was generally a lot of fun some jokes fell flat while others were hilarious i believe there is a lot of potential here  it wasnt as good as it could have been but a second installment could be amazing
Jan 1 2016,positive,i know that this movie sparked a lot of controversy due to its existence of being a reboot but im happy to say that its a great addition to the ghostbusters franchise this movie is funny fun and quite a spectacle all four leads give funny performances and have great chemistry chris hemsworth really stole the show for me every scene hes in is just hilarious also lets the talk about the scope and visuals for the tone of the movie the ghosts really look great the film just has this feeling of fun and adventure which is perfect for a summer blockbuster thank you paul feig lets see a sequel now
Jan 1 2016,negative,an insult to the original  never try to remake a classic 
Jan 1 2016,positive,excellent  3d and lots of fun
Jan 1 2016,negative,awful  absolutely awful even if youre new to this property its so horribly done if youre a fan of the original film youll want to walk out on it yet i love how hack critics falsely hype it up  its full of crappy writing forced acting bad editing forced scenarios unbelievably unrealistic characters crappy sound effects piss poor directing  to top it off this was pitched as a comedy i did not laugh let alone smile once the characters yell  shout a lot they gabbicker  a lot as though they sound smart but they really dont portray themselves as such  do not seem to put the effort in proving it the ghosts are from a scoobydoo film which is the only thing for kids to enjoyskip it
Dec 31 2015,positive,super fun it was a loving homage to the original and quite frankly not bad at all kate mckinnon def stole the show oh and chris hemsworth
Dec 31 2015,negative,huge fan of the old films this was awful male or female cast how on earth was this actually released new script new director better casting absolutely ruined what could have been a great film
Dec 29 2015,positive,ghostbusters does the original proud  great special effects good chemistry between the actresses and a very good popcorn movie  the jokes are for the adults but the kids will laugh without knowing the true joke and it pays homage over and over again to the original stars and movies  this time the critics got it right certified fresh
Dec 29 2015,positive,whos hollywood going to call when they need a new script 1980s of course   this time its the ghostbusters but gone are dan akroyd bill murray ernie hudson and the belated harold ramis and enter kristen wiig melissa mccarthy kate mckinnon and leslie jones   this movie was never given a fair chance as the internet feared someone attempting to make something new out of their childhoods and that is more or less what paul feig did however the worst thing this movie ultimately does is make you what to return to the original film to watch it and all of its nostalgia  ghostbusters 2016 does nothing to hurt the original it has many of the same beats of the original but does bring some modern day elements to a story we have seen before surprisingly ghostbusters makes for a fun time at the movies despite the extremely disappointing trailers ghostbusters is one of the better comedies we have gotten this year
Dec 28 2015,positive,too many people didnt give this movie a chance honestly i thought it was great if its your first ghostbusters movie youll love it go back and watch the old ones and youll notice whilst they are really good they arent spectacular
Dec 28 2015,negative,2 hours of my life ill never get back
Dec 27 2015,positive,not as good as the original but still really good
Dec 27 2015,negative,a poorly concieved ill timed nonsenical film that is only saved by its cast   grade d
Dec 27 2015,neutral,well that sucked it just goes to prove the original is always the best seriously though the only funny parts you saw in the trailer so consider movie seen save your money
Dec 27 2015,positive,i thought it was really funny i laughed out loud throughout the movie kind if a long setup but when they hit their stride its hilarious
Dec 27 2015,negative,meh thats all i can say  i feel what would have made the movie bettera continuation of the originalnot a complete retelling of an awesome and unique funny story  the only joy i got out of this movie was the search for cameos
Dec 26 2015,positive,definitely not as bad as critics say it is its fun and entertaining and there were some good throw backs to the original is it perfect no but what is
Dec 26 2015,negative,pure crap awful effects poor casting and lame jokes proves the internet was right save your money
Dec 26 2015,negative,i know a lot of people were labelled sexist or racist because they slated this film lets get one thing straight this film got slated because its shit no other reason
Dec 26 2015,positive,the funniest movie of the year the cameos are great the performances are spectacular the writing is superb and the visuals are marvelous one of the best of the year
Dec 26 2015,positive,great movie fun to watch right amount of laughs story and action
Dec 26 2015,negative,a horribly unfunny sloppy poorly conceived poorly written poorly made cashin scavenging the meat from a far mightier beast i did laughoutloud 3 times but at how cringingly awful it was the hilarious trash you and your mates dream up while drunk and then wake the next day to realise how fantastically lame you all are
Dec 25 2015,neutral,you better check your straight white male privilege before you see this movie or read this review women can be powerful female protagonists as well female characters do not need need love interests feminine humor can make you laugh lady driven sci fi movies can be cult classics this movie happened to be bad though the ending was terrible the logic of the universe this movie was filmed in was destroyed when the building started rebuilding itself and the 2 girls pulled the other 2 girls out of the building like they were pulling a bucket out of a well with no effort at all it wasnt the worst but i regret seeing it im also not a small child
Dec 23 2015,positive,ever since the trailers been out its been receiving a lot of hate from fans believe its ruining my childhood well the movie is out now and i went and saw it and ill be honest i was quite surprised of how good it was it kept the source material it kept the concept the cameos were awesome the actresses were cool and the visual effects were outstanding ill be honest there were some moments where i laughed a little bit however the pacing and editing were a bit off but if youre a fan of ghostbuster then go on right ahead and see this reboot but would i say its as good as the original film id say no but is it good as its own ghostbusters film in its universe absolutely
Dec 22 2015,positive,very very good movie prior to this films release i was very hyped for the reboot thanks to its stellar cast and phenomenal director upon the films release my hopes were certainly brought down due to the films poor box office reception and mixed reviews from audiences however the film turned out to be quite the entertaining experience yes a fair amount of the films jokesgags fall flat but the majority of them land and land well whether thanks to solid writing or great performances from the cast especially mckinnon jones and hemsworth in addition to some worthwhile jokes it also features some stellar visual effects and great direction from feig now though this certainly doesnt compare to the original it still holds up on its own and is much better than ghostbusters 2
Dec 21 2015,positive,awesome movielots of comedy compared to the first one
Dec 21 2015,positive,kate mckinnon is supernaturally good leslie jones is also a welcome addition the rest is about what youd expect from a paul feig  kristen wiiig  melissa mccarthy  collaboration with lots of fun cameos     definitely would go see a sequel which is about the best thing you can say about any movie and stay til thr end
Dec 19 2015,positive,actually really good really rather good better than i expected
Dec 19 2015,positive,i thought the old cast was going to appear on the new movie that sucks im still gonna why am i complaininglol but bill murray is awesome
Dec 19 2015,positive,no matter what your opinion is on this someone will be annoyed if i sat here and wrote about how much i actually enjoyed this
Dec 19 2015,neutral,entertaining  but corny
Dec 18 2015,positive,one of the best movie i have seen
Dec 18 2015,positive,c  the occasional laugh in ghostbusters isnt enough to make up for the lack of original ideas in this almost scene for scene remake of the 1984 classic
Dec 16 2015,positive,loved every minute so funny
Dec 15 2015,positive,is it the boobs you dont like    well what    ghostbusters is directed by paul feig bridesmaids spy and stars melissa mccarthy kate mckinnon leslie jones kristen wiig and chris hemsworth it is a reboot of the 1984 original and as you know has come under a lot of hate and controversy    now let me get this quickly out of the way i did not like the original ghostbusters i already said why in my previous review and wont spend a lot of time explaining why as itll come into comparison with this film    yes this is the better movie but not by a country mile    the good i think the thing i can appreciate most about this reboot is that paul feig has officially gone insane maybe it was the troll comments on his trailer or somethingbut he really did embrace ludicrous in this one there is a lot of immature childish things in this movie which work perfectly a lovely inclusion and explanation of the original films logo a 2d animated infusion and queef jokes is just the tip of the crisisberg    you heard mequeef jokes and it sort of set the tone for the stupidity this is a rare sort of fun that we dont see i think this is comparable to the really crappy live action scoobydoo movies you know the ones that know one liked the new ghostbusters is like that but with a shine of badassery and simply not giving a shit what people think kate mckinnon is by far the best character of this movie her quips attitude and style makes up the core of this movies existence to fuck with people im not being hyperbolic when you know your film will probably gain massive backlash from the choice of female casting and you shoot a ghost in the penis that take guts to perform holy shit    oh and the movie has about a 5545 hit to miss ratio of jokes when they landthey land with quite a punch a silly stupid punchthe ghosts like pretty nice as well a good special effect job i saw the movie in 3d and it combined nicely adding for some family jumps and surprises excellent    and now what youve been waiting forthe bad just like its original there are no characters in this film i did a little experiment to test and see if i could see a characters line working being said by another ghostbuster and it worked fine there isnt a defined split of personality and a united trait of family essence that brings these characters together its just annoying thats why i liked kate mckinnons character so much she seemed to want to be in a film with a bit more spice than the boring walkie talkie slate that melissa mccarthy brings to the table such a boring character there is no formidable antagonist in this film apart from white male im not exaggerating its the same apocalypse mumbo jumbo as the original as well just what the fuck was this movie and why does it exist    im so confused why remake this i have so many conflicting thoughts of anger and a weird sense of self respect to this movie for just doing as they please and having a good time doing so this movie is fun funny and will most certainly entertain the family but is it a good movie nooooooo no its not its shell is like ectoplasmflobby and conditioned to feel like i assumed a sketch from saturday night live im just impressed they got bill muarry to fucking cameo this is guilty pleasure of the year alongside id42except this one knew that the only people taking this one with eyes full of best movie ever awe would be young children and againi kinda liked that    c    58100    video review 
Dec 15 2015,negative,it has its moments but 2016s ghostbusters is another reboot misfire despite standout energetic performances from mckinnon and hemsworth the film simply stumbles through joke after joke and set piece after set piece trying to find its groove but never does
Dec 14 2015,positive,very enjoyable lots of nostalgic elements that are great but can also spoil the story slightly too long where some scenes could of been skipped overall welcome back and go see as your sure to have fun     do we need anymore though
Dec 14 2015,positive,lots of fun with a great cast worth seeing for reasons totally separate from the original i laughed out loud quite a few times and there were a surprising number of scenes that were genuinely scary a movie worthy of the name
Dec 13 2015,positive,a really funny movie
Dec 13 2015,positive,entertaining  on par with ghostbusters 2
Dec 12 2015,positive,good movie definitely not as bad as what people are making it out to be
Dec 12 2015,positive,it was a good movie not bad for a remake
Dec 11 2015,positive,misandry makes me feel good    the original 1984 ghostbusters is my alltime favorite movie i can remember being in preschool and discussing various plot details with my fellow classmates to this day i quote the movie daily and wear many a graphic tshirt feature the now classic logo i still have the firehouse play set not a doll house and a plastic proton pack from the real ghostbusters cartoon only a couple of years ago my wife surprised me with the ecto1 lego set i am now 34years old so yeah i guess you can say bustin makes me feel good that movie means a lot to me and i understand the desire to want to protect it    having said that fuck these assholes who are trying to mask their misogyny behind the argument that the new movie besmirches the original most havent even seen it nor will they because of their fucked up ideology see it and then judge if you dont like it then fine thats your prerogative otherwise get bent the original stands on its own regardless of any iteration that comes after nothing is going to ruin it they already tried that with ghostbusters ii    erin kristen wiig is a professor at columbia university about to get tenure things come to a head when an old book she cowrote on the paranormal comes back to haunt her you see what i did there it appears her old friend and colleague abby melissa mccarthy has republished the book as she continues her work trying to prove the existence of ghosts accompanied by the technologically savvy wildcard jillian kate mckinnon erin gets roped into going on a ghost hunt where they encounter a spirit which propels them down their ghostbusting path along the way former mta employee and nyc history expert patty leslie jones joins the team after her own encounter with a malevolent ghost they also hire a receptionist kevin chris hemsworth hes a dumbdumb it seems that someone is planting devices across new york city to enhance the ghosts abilities to crossover into our dimension for the purposes of bringing on the apocalypse and world domination and when that happens the question must be asked who ya gonna call  i really enjoyed this movie especially the new characters each of the actresses brings their own unique style to the table and hot damn if it doesnt work well its unfortunate that the overall story particularly the third act doesnt help them out much paul feig is great at comedy action not so much when the camera is pointed at these talented actors letting them riff on one another thats when the film is at its best the film suffers when the filmmakers try to do too much with the ghostbusting action taking it to john woolevels of slow motion ridiculousness the many callbacks and cameos are hit and miss i could see these being added to the script at the request of the studio to appease fans    the mvp is clearly mckinnon in what should be her breakout role i couldnt take my eyes off of her any time she was on screen because i didnt want to miss a single word or facial expression if you have to make a comparison she is the egon of the group if egon were spunky and unhinged    thats the beauty of these characters none of them are straight copies of the previous cast im glad they didnt just make them female venkman female stantz etc they let the characters and actors do their own thing and the movie is all the better for it    theres been a lot of debate leading up to this movie with sexist nerds trying their best to control the narrative others wanted to dismiss it as trivial bigger problems in the world and so forth but theyre wrong this movie is important the debate matters it means something when you have four female characters who are heroes in their story not victims not the heros girlfriend the fact that a major movie studio released a femalecentric summer popcorn movie is huge not mentioning the fact that they chose to do with a previously existing beloved franchise i want this movie to do well and spawn sequels theres a specific image thats been floating around on the internet of kristen wiig at the ghostbusters premiere in it shes clasping hands with a little girl dressed in full gb regalia the smile on the girls face and wiigs reaction are everything shut up youre crying     why stop there i want a good wonder woman movie that does well at the box office i want to see more movies with casts like black panther say what you want but theres no denying that the latest fast  furious movies sport some of the more diversified casts out there in one calendar year we get not one but two star wars movies with female leads these are all very good and promising steps towards a more diverse time at the movies     somewhere along the line i forgot i was reviewing a movie i give ghostbusters 2016 3  12 chemically castrated internet trolls out of a possible 5
Dec 11 2015,positive,trailer review  it sucked  actual movie  it wasnt that bad
Dec 10 2015,positive,good but worth waiting for dvd some acting is a little too animated thats all
Dec 10 2015,neutral,it was just ok had some funny parts but this was not my cup of tea
Dec 9 2015,positive,at least in my recent memory no film has elicited more controversy than the 2016 all female led remake  of the classic 1984 film ghostbusters firstly ill say the thing that absolutely did not bother me was that they were females these 4 women are incredibly talented and they were the least of the problems regarding the marketing of this film like most of you i hated the trailers they were just horrible and absolutely gave me no interest in the film however the very positive reception and the surprising strong word of mouth reignited my initial interest in the film before the trailers were released and i can say that ghostbusters was a very entertaining time at the movies while it most certainly doesnt even hold a candle to the 1984 ghostbusters then again what ever could the reboot is a surprisingly fun and immensely entertaining film i was occupied throughout its 2 hour runtime and never caught myself looking at my watch or anything i just sat back and had a good time unfortunately the jokes missed more than they hit while i chuckled at a few parts i never really laughed out loud like i wanted too the script is also a little bit of a problem the dialogue is pretty corny and very thinly written throughout melissa mccarthy and kristen wiig are wonderful here of course theyre two of the funniest people working today and they were wonderful in their roles here im not a huge fan of leslie jones but she was good here she fit in well and did good enough now kate mckinnon stole the show here she stole every scene she was in and was probably the funniest part of the whole film shes incredibly talented and she shines in every scene she was in look i had absolutely no expectations at all for this and i came out of it pleasantly surprised and i definitely had an enjoyable time dont judge it before you see it give it a chance who knows you might actually like it i certainly did
Dec 8 2015,neutral,memories yes of the original haunts this effort that bravely attempts to recreate the feel of times gone by the ladies have mucho huevos but wouldve been better served by fresh material i think an honorable effort but no more than that
Dec 5 2015,positive,acting was good but the music chosen for the movie  movie scenes was so bad it was distracting the fact that it did not at the very least piggy back off of the original ghostbusters was a bit annoying
Dec 5 2015,positive,a great funny movie jones mckinnon and hemsworth steal the movie from the still very funny wiig and mccarthy needs to be seen in the theater
Dec 4 2015,negative,it just wasnt good despite some genuinely funny people being involved
Dec 4 2015,negative,i tried to think of the most harmless thing something i loved from my childhood something that could never ever possibly destroy us this movie did for ghostbusters what gozer did for the stay puft marshmallow man
Nov 27 2015,negative,this film should have never been made so sick of melissa mccarthy harold ramis would be so disappointed
Nov 27 2015,positive,i still dont understand the hate surrounding this its funny fun and is a throwback to the original
Nov 27 2015,positive,good reboot cameo approved
Nov 26 2015,positive,there are a few laughs to be had but it doesnt even come close to the original 1984 film ghostbusters the problem isnt the cast but instead the film has a contrived plot the female leads do their best at what little they have to work with but the film really feels forced and the novelty wears off about half way through the movie reminding us that there was nothing original here to begin with there were even times when the film started to feel a bit like the real ghostbusters cartoon but the 1986 animated version was much more imaginative than this latest installment in the ghostbusters franchise
Nov 25 2015,positive,ghostbusters are back this time girl style
Nov 23 2015,positive,not bad at all i thought i wasnt gonna like this movie and i thought wrong it doesnt get anywhere near the original but we all knew that wasnt going to happen the cast did a great job and chris hemsworth was hilarious
Nov 23 2015,negative,why does this movie exist
Nov 21 2015,negative,wtf did i just watch
Nov 19 2015,positive,laughs throughout dont listen to the haters
Nov 18 2015,positive,i loved it i also love all these ladies on snl  such so i was familiar with their styles as an original ghostbusters fan i feel they covered all the bases of a good remake on this classic my 4 year old is now obsessed wthis song  movie thanks
Nov 15 2015,positive,a fun reboot please ignore the haters crapping on this movie the women are great together chris hemsworth is a show stealer and since the villain proves to be weak when the ladies shot him in the youknowwhere im sure screen junkies honest trailer for this reboot film will be this ghost has no dk please ignore the haters and see this movie we need women to succeed more in hollywood films these days
Nov 15 2015,positive,loved kate mckinnon she had me rolling and chris hemsworthid hire him in a heartbeat too
Nov 14 2015,neutral,way better than l thought itd be but it was often slow and dragging on and the cast was trying too hard to be funny and often wasnt
Nov 14 2015,positive,was really worried before i went but it really works on its own give it a chance
Nov 10 2015,positive,okay all you haters really need to step back this movie has done everything it could do to give the franchise a fresh reboot without hashing out the same jokes we saw back in 1984 the cast is wonderful and kate mckinnon shines and steals the show for me leslie jones is freaking great and mccarthy and wigg pull off a the slightly more straight laced characters of this new quartet no one is trying to copy murray ackroyd ramis or hudson and nor should they have to they all bring something new and lovely to this franchise so haters theres the door dont let it hit you where the lord split you
Nov 10 2015,positive,i went into this not really knowing how it would play outit was hilarious  i thought they did a great job of creating a new updated plot with it it feeling like a remake the lines were delivered with precision
Nov 8 2015,positive,i really loved the movie the cameos and callbacks to the originals were spot on and not overdone goosebumps came over me when the theme music played and the 4 main actresses are comic geniuses i also loved that fall out boy sang the ghostbusters song   i give it 10 stars because it was just brilliant in my opinion did the original justice while still being comedy gold and its own awesome movie  
Nov 8 2015,positive,does not warrant the bad reviews i thought it was excellent loved the holtzmann character she makes it
Nov 8 2015,positive,was in a bad movie they couldve been a lot better and wish it had more ghost capturing but still a very funny movie
Nov 8 2015,positive,enjoyable often amusing and chuckle enducing but not massively laugh out loud funny a good way to pass a couple of hours but ultimately forgettable unless you already have your underpants in a twist about it no it probably isnt as good as the original but this annoyed me less than the original
Nov 8 2015,negative,i gave it a shot it was bad
Nov 7 2015,positive,very glad to see how everyone was connected great movie
Nov 7 2015,negative,nice trip down memory lane and some decent fx in just not enough there to scare up any real laughs they shouldve gave the cast more to work with
Nov 7 2015,positive,way better than a lot of people are making it out to be
Nov 6 2015,positive,i really enjoyed this  i dont understand all of the bad reviews  this was actually real good with lots of humor action and ghostbusting
Nov 5 2015,positive,this was great it was like the original ghostbusters only instead of every line of dialogue making me laugh its every other line and they explain why all these ghosts are appearing all of a sudden
Nov 5 2015,positive,it was goodkids had a blastnothing like the original but good enough
Nov 4 2015,positive,i thought this movie would be a bust but was surprised that it was as good as it was  a lot of people keep downplaying it because it is a reboot with new characters  but the cast was good and the jokes were funny and the special effects were amazing  i really hope that they do sequels for this  it was a fun movie and thats all that matters to me  i would definitely see this again and wish i would have seen it in 3d
Nov 3 2015,positive,going into ghostbusters is a tricky thing when it shouldnt be since it had a poor advertising campaign in my opinion plus taking on the beloved franchise of yesteryear which seems to be the norm nowadays discounting the stupid fanboy hate of the all girl cast which is for the most part unwarranted feig brings in his reliable wig and mccarthy from his previous comedies most notably bridesmaids and ensuing films and introduces to most film audiences the explosively fun kate mckinnon as holtzmann as the team tech who is the most fun to watch and badass whipping out all the new hardware to drool over and leslie jones as the streetsmart buster who knows a chunk of the tobin guide like spook stories to connect the science with wig and mccarthy for me are just ok as their humour is just a tad meh for me but the other ladies more than make up for it and hemmsworth is having a lot of fun in the role reversal as ditzy secretary there are a few dragging moments but once they start gearing up for the jump scares and action sequences things defintelty think snap the way they do and feels like the ghostbusters we know as a kid just with new polish on it take out the dreaded remix theme song and we are go p
Nov 2 2015,positive,i enjoyed myself i can kinda see why people might not like this movie people forget that the original movies were also quirky and corny that exactly what i was expecting and thats what i got the cast was amazingly delightful
Oct 31 2015,positive,did not think this was going to work but turned out to be a fantastic film that showed so much respect for the originals the cameos where fantastic and i think a remake with male cast would not of worked as well now i seen this movie bravo
Oct 31 2015,negative,glad i didnt pay for that one lol
Oct 31 2015,positive,ghostbusters is directed and cowritten by paul feig and it stars kristen wiig melissa mccarthy kate mckinnon leslie jones and chris hemsworth in a supernatural comedy about a group of girls who have discovered a ghost and wanted to create a business of catching ghosts when i first saw the trailers i thought that they were fine even though it was blowing up with negatives stuff even when it has positive reviews i was still skeptical about it as it is a reboot and the audience were still not necessarily on board with it even after it was out as this is my own opinion and not anyone elses i can say that i really like the film even if it isnt perfect the acting is really good and the most laughs that i got from the film were from kate mckinnon and leslie jones surprisingly as they were having the most fun out of it even though kate mckinnon is the best part of the film for me the special effects look really good even though there were times that looked a bit obvious that they were computer animated and the action scenes are fun to watch as they are more entertaining than the original and sequel of ghostbusters in terms of character development jillian and patty are really good but there wasnt much variety for kristen wiig or melissa mccarthys characters most of the humor gives a laugh but there were some that really missed the mark to the point that i was rolling my eyes at times in all honestly the worst part of the film is not even the girls nor the humor its the villain because the villain is very grating in this that i really hate him in a bad way that affects the film in a weird way the villain reminded me of when jesse eisenberg played lex luthor in a way that it really doesnt seem fitting in this film the weird part about the film is that one of the problems that i have is the editing i didnt notice it in any other paul feigs other films but in this it really seem very erratic as it goes to a shot of the characters talking and it goes to the next shot of the other characters just looking at the same direction as the characters that were talking and it goes by quickly that i was like what was the point the cameos werent really necessary as it kept reminding me that i should just watch the original ghostbusters instead of this film and not only that they werent really important for the plot a film that does put in a cameo that was actually important to the plot was star trek and even star trek into darkness so while i dont think ghostbusters deserves the massive hate that it got i can see why people might not like it as this has major problems and is paul feigs weakest film so far but i enjoyed the film enough to say that its a really good movie and while its not the original its better than the sequel and if they make the sequel ill go see it
Oct 29 2015,positive,you can literally go for a bathroom break at any time and youre not missing anything but its still pretty entertaining probably better than tyler perrys boo a halloween but i cant be certain
Oct 28 2015,positive,ghostbusters was very stupid yet funny and having chris hemsworth as a helper made it funny because he acted like a sexy idiot the best part was near the end because the graphic detailing of the ghosts were awesome
Oct 27 2015,negative,this is about on par with number 2 and that was a horrible mess for a sequel these reboots just dont work the first film was a story with supernatural elements this is supernatural elements with a very weak plot i get sick of these films not acknowledging the original films they fail mostly because people have been there and done that why couldnt one of these be the daughter taking over the business they are too busy alienating the core audience which are big fans of the original which is an absolute classic reboots are just lazy and audiences are sick of them they just dont need to be here especially films from the 80s im most eager to see flatliners because it is a sequel that acknowledges the original these filmmakers and actors needed better material i only enjoyed two scenes probably in the movie and they were the character moments the second half of the film felt like the scooby doo movie and really forgot what the film franchise is about the characters i cant forgive such lazy filmmaking here sure it looks good but 140 million should look good a huge disappointment to say the least    ive been going through backlog of movies and reviewing them all over again with dates but a film like this i cannot waste my time 26032018    caught this again and my opinion hasnt changed reboot was not a wise choice they needed to ground this in the ghostbusters universe and that might have assisted with the wild storyline it fails due to it attempting too much the budget is excessive and the characters are not fitting im shocked mckinnon wasnt connected as egons daughter massive opportunity lost reboots are not the way to move forward 28012019
Oct 27 2015,negative,got forced into seeing this travesty if i could erase it from my memory i would
Oct 26 2015,positive,was so awesome  i hate to say it but i like this one versus the old version
Oct 25 2015,positive,ghostbusters is a fun continuationremake of the original franchise
Oct 25 2015,positive,it pays its homage to the originals while setting up a new feminine version of the series it works quite well but doesnt stray far from the trail following in the footsteps of the original i wish they would create adventures of their own
Oct 24 2015,negative,the jokes fell flat every time as a woman i did not like this movie i know im supposed to like it because of girl power or something but maybe girl power is really knowing when something sucks
Oct 23 2015,positive,funny but i still love the original two
Oct 23 2015,positive,this would be better without kristen wiig
Oct 23 2015,positive,solid funny entertaining yes not a patch on the first but fine all the same
Oct 22 2015,positive,good funny solid harmless yet about halfway through the movie i got a sinking feeling that i couldnt shake the entire thing felt completely unnecessary the movie doesnt quite justify its existence and thats a problem then again theres that picture going around of those two girls in costume talking with kristen wiig at the premiere if the film is in any way inspiring to them and others like them then the film probably did its job for everyone else its fine but its definitely a step down for feig
Oct 22 2015,positive,i laughed so much loved the movie really the perfect fun summertime movie
Oct 20 2015,negative,i really wanted to love this but the characters were all dreadful the story was weak and the jokes missed every spot  such a let down
Oct 20 2015,positive,i absolutely loved it one of the funniest movies of the year with a great cast and awesome special effects full of action and a good reboot of the original as a stand alone movie my favorite movie of the year so far
Oct 20 2015,positive,what a great movie hilariously funny and entertaining throughout
Oct 20 2015,neutral,meh    not the train wreck you expect but not good either   the opening act showed promise and kate mckinnon was great  but the rest of the movie just feels like a paint by numbers remake of the original with women instead of guys   there are cameos from the original cast  bill murray was obviously cashing a check  if youre a guy the finale definitely feels like a shot to the nether regions
Oct 19 2015,positive,the movie was fantastic everything i hoped it would be great gags the girls were hilarious and tough and the action was great must see
Oct 19 2015,positive,very well done loved how they worked original cast into the movie
Oct 19 2015,positive,love the reboot of ghostbusters cant wait for the next one
Oct 19 2015,negative,skip this hunk of crap and just watch the original
Oct 18 2015,positive,i dont get all the negativity i guess when comparing to one of the funniest most inventive and coolest movies ever thatll happen  the movie was good not great and very funny
Oct 18 2015,positive,great reboot of a classic series totally new story with lots of homage to the predecessors stinger during and after credits
Oct 18 2015,positive,saw ghostbusters tonight and guess what it didnt ruin my childhood in fact i thought it was hilarious and visually really cool the cast is made up of some of the funniest comedians working period go watch it girlscanbustghoststoo
Oct 17 2015,negative,terrible reboot dont waste your money on it and save it for next weekend when star trek beyond is out
Oct 17 2015,neutral,75 good reviews make ghostbusters probably the most overrated film of the year the movie just wasnt as memorable as the original i think ghostbusters got so many good reviews just to shut up people who said a ghostbusters reboot was a bad idea   i cant even say ghostbusters proves what paul feig wanted it to sorry but i only laughed hard during any chris hemsworth secretary scene hell i even can say my 13 year old niece just laughed hard during his scenes  kristen wiig is just playing the dopely dry humor character she always plays she gets slimed many times but none of those scenes are as funny as when bill murray got slimed once in the original melissa mccarthy is just a brainy version of the feisty character she always plays   kate mckinnon is trying something different at least rather than just phoning it in her character is more strange than she is funny though while leslie jones is basically just loud  the original was full of sharp dialogue paul feigs ghostbusters lacks that even since a lot of acres and jokes just drag on and on none of the cameos of the original stars werent even too memorable  paul feig at least showed us chris hemsworth is funny since he got all the best lines feig didnt write anything too great for the women to say as for the cgi it looked like it was stolen from scooby doo monsters unleashed
Oct 17 2015,negative,womp womp  exactly what you expected  not as bad as the trailer would make you believe but by no means great  its exactly mediocre
Oct 16 2015,neutral,loved ladies as ghostbusters but wish they got a better story
Oct 16 2015,positive,the movie is fun and worth a look but i found myself wishing a ghostbusters sequel had been done before this reboot was launched i respect the film on its own merits but it is tough to catch lightning in a bottle twice    in my opinion kate mckinnon totally steals the show as holtzmann also seeing chris hemsworth in a nonhero role as kevin was refreshing and had me laughing out loud a few times    the film is all you can ask of a summer fun flick and be sure to stick around after the credits
Oct 15 2015,positive,awesome i need a second one
Oct 14 2015,positive,i thought this was fun and funny  chris hemsworth and kate mckinnon were my favourite actors i wish they hadnt just rebootedremade ghostbusters and instead continued the story line like many years later the original ghostbusters are washed up etc
Oct 14 2015,positive,better than ghostbusters 2  not even close to ghostbusters 1
Oct 13 2015,negative,it wasnt very funny or clever  had a bad story but the fights were more interesting
Oct 13 2015,negative,garbage so remaking it with a female cast didnt sound horrible but the cast they choose was wiig is overrated and has never been funny mccarthy is hit or miss more miss in this film leslie is better then i thought she would be but she always plays the same stereotypical ny woman kate is the only great performance breakout role chris hemsworth is the second funniest person in the movie the cameos are nice too after the performances nothing else really works directing script editingnothing seems to be worthy of being such a high publicity movie but atleast they were able to use the name of the original movie to steal money from people want to see it wait to rent it at redbox or see it bootlegged then it might be worth the money spent
Oct 12 2015,positive,a weak plot and third act keep this from four stars but this is definitely an entertaining flick worthy of the ghostbusters name
Oct 11 2015,positive,was a really good film and they made it their own without copying the original
Oct 10 2015,positive,clunky in parts but still fun and funny
Oct 4 2015,positive,its funny make sure to stay after the credits and watch for cameos
Oct 4 2015,negative,pointless remake its sad to see a great group of talent in this mess
Oct 1 2015,positive,better than i expected cameos were awesome story was pretty good too 
Sep 30 2015,positive,to be honest this movie did not suck as much as people think this has a fun times especially in imax this movie was amazing and people need to see that
Sep 27 2015,positive,the key is to see this film as its own film without comparing it to its predecessors  on its own we really enjoyed it  the special effects were great and it had some good gags and funny moments
Sep 26 2015,neutral,entertains but forgettable kind of like the original ghostbusters 2 movie
Sep 24 2015,positive,judging after what i saw in the god awful trailers this movie was a pleasant surprise  but it is still not a great film by any means  and it is better than ghostbusters ii  b
Sep 24 2015,negative,this new one felt like such a bad retread and lacked new ideas just watch the original its way better in every way
Sep 23 2015,positive,i really really enjoyed it
Sep 21 2015,positive,this movie was great fun obviously a different type of comedy compared to the original but still very funny effects looks great great cameos as well
Sep 20 2015,positive,dont understand why people were hating this movie before it came out i was happy to get anything on the big screen again with ghostbusters i was laughing a lot watching this and i enjoyed the new song it was time to change it up to see the cameos of the original cast was good to
Sep 19 2015,positive,absolutely hilarious all the cameos worked well in this movie as well
Sep 12 2015,positive,better than expected but also could have been way better
Sep 11 2015,positive,good film entertaining and some break out laugh moments but dont compare to old ones as plot is different still fun film to watch
Sep 10 2015,neutral,the ghosts looked great and the new ghostbusting traps were awesome i enjoyed watching them take down the ghosts this film felt like watching the live action scooby doos
Sep 9 2015,negative,just dontso badi wanted it to be good it just wasnt
Sep 9 2015,negative,there was no way this was going to compare to the original i feel sorry for chris hemsworth having to be in a horrible movie
Sep 8 2015,positive,hilarious i had 0 expectations but i was pleasantly surprised
Sep 6 2015,negative,the truth is the movie is hamstrung by the original ghostbusters movie you can help but compare and this film doesnt know what it wants to be it certainly is nowhere near the level of the original     as a stand alone movie it might have worked but its a really ghostbusters movie the tone is wrong  the cgi is jarring     cast are mostly fine  especially wiig mccarthy not so much
Sep 5 2015,negative,wow unspeakably bad on so many levels   bad writing casting acting  only redeeming point was all surviving cast from the real movie got cameos  save it for a netflix movie night
Sep 4 2015,positive,very impressed by the vision of these movie its funny scary sad and it has it moments of nostalgia ignore the critics and the haters saying this is a bad film just because feminism the humor used here is not man against women its women vs women histericall
Sep 4 2015,positive,much better than everyone said pleasantly surprised its not the original but it didnt try to be heck of a lot better than ghostbusters 2 i would watch it again good for its own merits and a funny movie with a good story love the pop ins from original cast
Sep 2 2015,negative,well i liked the effectsmovie was dumb though tried to hard to be funny and just wasnt
Aug 31 2015,positive,kate mckinnon was so funny
Aug 31 2015,positive,dont touch the originals  not bad but way too overhyped
Aug 30 2015,positive,visually one of the best 3d movies ive seen surprisingly funny  and i feared the worst would be a 5 start movie if it wasnt for leslie johnson being a stereotype who cant act  chris helmsworth who is showing other than thor he cant act  the awful cringe cameos and fall out boy theme song in middle of it
Aug 30 2015,positive,great movie i couldnt understand the initial bad reviews  the original one is still stronger as a film but this one is really funny very good jokes great acting the third act suffers from the modern hollywood approach of big explosions and fake drama it actually looks similar to the avengers ending but the gags are so funny it makes up for all the bad parts
Aug 29 2015,negative,if you were expecting anything with original humor like either of the tow originals youlol be sorely dissapointed  effects good humor sporadic at best  very formulaic copy and bad at that of the originals  i suspect most of the positive critics reviews were from family members of the production company
Aug 29 2015,neutral,not as good as the original
Aug 28 2015,negative,horrible simply horrible
Aug 28 2015,positive,girls suck white people only
Aug 27 2015,neutral,no horror and all puns
Aug 27 2015,negative,will never even watch it just based on the trailer
Aug 25 2015,positive,the movie was a lot of fun and the visuals were amazing dont listen to the haters give it a shot 
Aug 25 2015,negative,its mere existence is an insult to the original
Aug 25 2015,positive,funny and entertaining movie i can watch it over and over again and still laugh and enjoy it
Aug 25 2015,positive,this movies is fricken hilarious  i saw it during a customer appreciation week and everyone in the theater couldnt stop laughing  great performances from everyone  sure it cant beat the original but it is still good
Aug 23 2015,positive,actually a lot better than i thought it was going to be really funny in places 
Aug 22 2015,positive,not as good as the originals but i didnt expect it to be nor did i really want it to be  ghostbusters successfully sets up a brand new series and uses many successful call backs to the original  not as good a reboot as star trek but definitely one of the better reboots out there  these women will develop better chemistry together if given the opportunity
Aug 21 2015,positive,i dont see why people are ragging on this movie so hard i loved the original and i loved this one just as much and this movie is for fans and newcomers alike the cameos are great and theyve already set up a sequel lets just enjoy it
Aug 21 2015,positive,amazing visual and extremely funny
Aug 20 2015,positive,boring replacing the old classic crew who you gonna call a better director but i do have to add 3 stars because it was hilarious in smart clever funny moments
Aug 20 2015,positive,better than i expected the new cast is a bit different but give them a chance theyre not too bad looking forward to seeing part 2 just wish the old cast had more of a role in the movie
Aug 19 2015,positive,absolutely hilarious and original throughout this reconstruction of a loved franchise does the original 1984 movie justice
Aug 19 2015,neutral,it was sooooooo just flounderingly okay it has its charms but what a letdown considering the wonderful cast and property spoiler alert why oh why did they make it so you can kill ghosts now really awful
Aug 19 2015,positive,it really was a good movie and i loved all the special guest appearances
Aug 18 2015,positive,dont believe the negative hype ghostbusters is a lot of fun its hilarious  the leads have great chemistry together it is flawed but when a film expected to be this terrible turns out to be really solid you cant help but be excited please go see ghostbusters this weekend i need a sequel
Aug 16 2015,positive,excited for the movie to come out and i really want to see the new ghostbusters reboot
Aug 16 2015,positive,chris hemsworth makes this movie 
Aug 16 2015,positive,it goes without saying that it is pure pointless fluff  the original is and always will be superior  at times it even feels as if it is passive aggressively insulting fans of the original  however it does have a handful of big laughs and if it gives little girls a sense of empowerment im happy
Aug 14 2015,positive,i fully expected to hate this movie but ended up really enjoying it and developing a serious crush on kate mckinnon
Aug 13 2015,negative,a travesty leave theses iconic movie alone
Aug 13 2015,negative,terrible film never remake the ghostbusters again you have no idea what you are doing
Aug 13 2015,positive,a lot of people give this movie shit but its definitely worth the money to go see it had the best 3d interaction ive seen as of yet and i really loved the storyline all of your favorites come back even if hrs for quick cameos the jokes were great the new technology better and it was so cool seeing the new tricks they had up their sleeps the girls did a great job
Aug 12 2015,positive,so funny stay until the end credits for an extra scene 
Aug 12 2015,positive,feels refreshingly different amongst the onslaught of homogenous 12a blockbusters weve been getting these past couple of years part of that has to do with the fact that it wholeheartedly embraces the fact thats its a movie aimed at kids with adult humour cleverly littered in in the post dark knight era of darkgrittyviolent for no real reason 12a cinema part of it has to do with the fact that it is an all female cast bringing a different energy to standard hollywood fare
Aug 10 2015,neutral,good movie had fun watching it it can never add up to the original one
Aug 10 2015,positive,lots of laughs kms character was hilarious loved all the nods to the first show and the cameos
Aug 10 2015,positive,fun and light great summer movie
Aug 10 2015,negative,this is going to be awful
Aug 10 2015,negative,this is beyond a slap in the face to fans of the original nothing more than a shameless cash grab
Aug 9 2015,positive,this movie is really funny  i would have to wonder how a reasonable person would not find it funny    they kept the basic premiss of the original did enough to make it more than their own  paid homage to the original with some of the best use of cameo roles you could imagine  the only difference is the it was women in the main roles and they were funny  super funny i think the storyline was even better than the first one    i find it sad for all the haters out there and i would have to think it is not rated higher because of some misogynists that have not even seen the movie
Aug 9 2015,positive,a superb cast shine in this extremely likeable riff on ghostbusters which always tries to be its own film melissa mccarthy and kristin wiigs comedy genius is downplayed allowing newcomers kate mckinnon both broad and pleasurably weird and leslie jones to hit some of the best laughs much better than it is expected to be
Aug 9 2015,positive,ghostbusters is a story of missed opportunities the cast is fantastic and singlehandedly elevates the material but that only makes the viewer contemplate what could have been had they been given a better script in particular chris hemsworth and kate mckinnon steal the show however in the end while it is certainly tolerable ghostbusters is simply not funny enough to recommend
Aug 9 2015,positive,funny with lots of cameos  most of the actors pulled from well known personas but kate mckennon and chris hemsworth really went out of typecast  not just a remastered oldie but entirely different story with only a couple of elements locked in place  lots of easter eggs for those of us who saw the original release
Aug 8 2015,positive,the original still holds a place in my heart but this rebooted ghostbusters was very entertaining lots of laughs
Aug 8 2015,negative,its really sad that its not ok to believe that this isnt a good movie without being labeled something bad sony really ramped up their efforts to ram this awful movie down our throats as best they could but a bowtie on a turd is still a turd
Aug 7 2015,neutral,rating 53  though ghostbusters deserves credit for trying it ends up as a thinly written and formulaic reboot of the iconic supernaturalbusting team
Aug 6 2015,positive,entertaining but a few unanswered threads that i didnt like the cast has great chemistry though i still prefer the original
Aug 6 2015,positive,cant wait for a sequel
Aug 4 2015,neutral,didnt care for it much  some funny bits  the end credits were quite amusing
Aug 4 2015,positive,the movie is ok its a total popcorn flick definitely not cancerous but not glorious either if you wanted to love youll probably find it ok if you wanted to hate it boy oh boy youll find many reasons to hate it i thought it was semienjoyable best parts were the actual ghostbusing overall its a solid 35
Aug 4 2015,positive,funny writing peppers this movie but it lacked the charm and chemistry the original fab four had plus what the hell were they trying to prove by casting hemsworth
Aug 4 2015,negative,what a bullshit i saw some images about it there is no murray no original cast i think i will hate it
Aug 3 2015,negative,this is a remake that shouldnt have been made  rotten right through
Aug 2 2015,positive,i grew up watching the originals and had high hopes going into the film thankfully i wasnt disappointed  i found the film funny and a wonderful restart for the movie concepts  i love the fact that this film has women being the lead  my one critique would be that the odd behavior of city officials and the main antagonist  even with that i loved the movie
Aug 1 2015,neutral,its not as bad as trailers but not great either some chuckles but nothing new or amazing 3d was good though and love the look of ghosts
Jul 31 2015,positive,fun couldve been funnier many of the movies most engaging moments are in the trailer but it was entertaining and fun
Jul 31 2015,positive,pretty awesome effects also pretty funny entertainment for the hole family
Jul 30 2015,positive,i thought it was a  really great way to reboot the ghostbusters for the next generation but the only i really think that they have done in the movie but didnt was make it so the old ghostbusters were actually once ghostbusters in this world and maybe even have them help out somehow with the new ghostbusters
Jul 26 2015,positive,it was a really good movie
Jul 26 2015,negative,movie was so bad the original two are old and still ten times better than this garbage fell asleep during this movie
Jul 26 2015,negative,very cheesy still think the original was better
Jul 25 2015,positive,decent movie and im really pleased that hollywood is making movies that dont involve male leadshowever this wasnt good enough to mean were going to get more female driven movies you can do better hollywood
Jul 24 2015,positive,wellhere it is a film that despite its shortcomings and humongous controversy surrounding it has finally been released paul fiegs 2016 reboot ghostbusters and look guys i wanna just quickly talk about this film for a second because of its controversy did i want a reboot to this eh i would of preferred this being a sequel and if they force awakens it where the old cast passes the torch did i mind a female cast no i was willing to give them a chance did i hate the marketing for the film yeah it really poorly presented the film even after seeing it did i think it might suck yeah kind of sony and the fans were being mindless children on their respective parts and am i misogynist jesus no ok basically my point is with the controversy if you made up your mind on the film good for you i for one had no idea how to feel about this and there is literally no way i can retrospect this with a clear answer to whether we needed this or not so here is just what my thoughts were after seeing the film it was ok yeah its just ok call me whatever you want based off what i said but it was in all truth just a very forgettable but ok film sigh look lets just break down the good and bad already the good stuff was some of the jokes made were funnier than i expected them to be the cast did a decent job with the material given to them the characters were actually pretty decently written the direction by paul fieg is alright kevin played by chris hemsworth was a huge stand out and was hilarious in every scene he was in and i did admired when paul fieg was trying to make the film stand out on its own the negatives however are present still basically a lot of jokes missed the mark both from the script  main casr thei cant believe im about to say thisactually really offensive portrayal of the men as jerks or idiots and jabs it makes about the films controversy which i think it should of avoided so it could be timeless a very poorly developed villain a final act so silly it seriously makes the 2nd films statue of liberty climax look normal overused the gadgets of the original like the proton packs instead of using it sparingly sadly retreading too many elements of the first film the cgi making the new universe really really cartoonish and the cameos from the original cast were awful outside of sigourney weaver so overall it was a really forgettable but at the very least alright attempt to reboot ghostbusters i honestly wished it was going with trying to stand on its own but it ended up being a reboot that i think those who didnt watch the original or are little will enjoy plenty as for me it was alright and as from someone who recently saw the original i wish it was a sequel that passed the torch on to this talented female cast
Jul 24 2015,negative,no way this will be any good  it will be impossible for them to recreate the magic that is ghostbusters  while we desire the nostalgia of this movie we do not want anything reimagined that will undoubtedly be worse than the second movie
Jul 23 2015,positive,the girls were funny especially kate m and they were always fun to watch on the screen but every time they started fighting any ghosts it was just kind of blah none of the ghost parts really worked and was way more fun watching the group interact with each other and test their new weapons then when a ghost was on the screen the cast was great but rebooting ghostbusters didnt need to happen
Jul 23 2015,positive,it wasnt bad but it wasnt great i thought it had a perfect cast even though dialogue was a bit try hard im glad it was rebooted with women why not it was fun to see the cameos but where was rick moranis chris hemsworth was an adorable hunk of a man who knew thor could dance so well  the special effects were superb but it paled in comparison to the original
Jul 23 2015,positive,its definitely not the original but still a ghostly good time
Jul 22 2015,negative,special effects were cool only a couple parts were funny and most of the laughs involved hemsworth considering the actual female comedians in thiswhat a crock of shit horrible remake
Jul 21 2015,negative,it was fun in parts but the stars in the film as good as they were didnt seem comfortable in their parts as they tried to portray unbelievable characters  its a sad reboot that only has nostalgia to carry it shelving ghostbusters yet again for a few more decades    fans have waited so long to see the story continue not a politicly correct parade that sacrifices story and everything else for a girl power demonstration  it even fails on cool guy chris hemsworth making him a pointless bumbling idiot with garbage dialog and jokes for a 3yr old small spoiler  he did make a good bad guy though    i found myself forcing a laugh trying to enjoy it  i didnt hate it though and i wasnt board  just expected much more  and my expectations werent very high to begin with
Jul 20 2015,positive,this is a wonderfully funny movie  no its not as good as the original but its ok  its well done the cast is amazing and i laughed more than at any other comedy in recent years  i cant wait for the sequel
Jul 19 2015,positive,i always judge a movie of would i watch it again  i have to ask would i watch ghostbusters again i would have to to say yes      will i watch a sequel yes     should there be a sequel yes  judging by the after credits absolutely yes
Jul 19 2015,positive,ghostbusters reboot is fun more or less expecially for kate and chris performances  a good movie that make you laugh with easy jokes for everyone
Jul 18 2015,positive,its really an enjoyable film may not be as good as the original but the jokes are funny and frequent perfectly matching its equally hilarious cast especially kate mckinnon
Jul 16 2015,positive,i had been wanting to see this movie since it came out but i kept seeing bad reviews for this movie everywhere still went to go see it despite the reviews and it was amazing so hilarious a must watch
Jul 16 2015,positive,ghostbusters    two longtime friends with paranormal expertise team up with an awkward engineer and a wisecracking subway employee to quell a sudden uprising of ghosts in new york city     sigh     when attempts at a third ghostbusters with the original cast fell through multiple times a decision for a reboot was made infusing a top notch female cast with a director known for great comedies like spy and bridesmaids into a much beloved franchise sounded like a good idea much to the chagrin of misogynistic internet trolls but a very mild pg13 rating hamstrings the finished product in particular melissa mccarthy leslie jones and writerdirector paul feig are kept on a very short and disappointing leash but while half the jokes fall flat the upgraded special effects and cameos are much appreciated     grade  c    big al says if youre looking for some mideighties nostalgia then go see ghostbusters in the theatreotherwise its a renter
Jul 14 2015,positive,it was seriously a blast groin the past great movie just had some what the heck moments but it was good
Jul 14 2015,positive,with all the hype surrounding this film before its release it was always going to be difficult for it to be considered anything but a failure unless it was just as good as the original unfortunately this isnt the case it is so difficult to view this film pretending the original doesnt exist and therefore in comparison to the original it pales in comparison there are some genuinely funny moments from chris hemsworth but the majority of the other jokes feel forced as empowering as these films try to be i cant help but feel that by having a full female cast it means that the films flaws are aimed at the female cast i would have preferred a mixed gender team to really show that the genders can be equal and equally funny unfortunately this is not paul feigs way
Jul 13 2015,positive,was expecting this movie to be a total flop but i was wrong i loved this move actors played it well and i laughed my butt off
Jul 13 2015,negative,1st stop calling this ghostbusters 3 it is not a sequel it is a reboot 2nd its going to suck the big one  you need to separate this from the paul fieg one i am sure 90 of the want to see votes are from before this crazy change of director and actors happened
Jul 13 2015,positive,very funny  better if you didnt see previews because many jokes were already shown but still entertaining flick
Jul 13 2015,neutral,while not without its flaws i thought it was entertaining not bad but not good either cameos felt forced and there was no need to reference the originals every few minutes if it tried standing on its own it would have been better cgi was awful mckinnon stole the show for me    note it is ok to not like this movie just have legitimate reasons why
Jul 12 2015,positive,exceeded my expectations which were cautiously optimistic going in overall highly entertaining and there were plenty of solid laughs i quite enjoyed the actual ghosts as well they were creepy and fun in a way that is consistent with the series the production borrows from the original film in all the right ways without being a slave to the original plot or style this is its own movie in lots of meaningful ways one of my favorite gags was when they find the old fire station i wont spoil that here but that was clever overall i recommend it with a ba
Jul 11 2015,positive,surpassing my original expectations which were pretty high this movie adds new elements to ghostbusters but still has tie ins with the old the trailers so this movie do it no justice as the movie is hilarious and very well acted while it isnt perfect the fall out boy version is absolutely abysmal the movie does well enough to keep you entertained through out and i have high hopes for the next installment
Jul 11 2015,neutral,there were some elements i likedparticularly kate mckinnon and chris hemsworthbut it was pretty mediocre overall my biggest complaint is probably how reliant it was on cg rather than practical effects which made much of the movie look like a nauseating video game  not enough jokes landed which is too bad because there were a handful of really good ones and the plotting was really bad
Jul 11 2015,positive,would have gotten more but melissa mccarthy playing melissa mccarthy playing melissa mccarthy shame really
Jul 10 2015,negative,epic disaster whose idea was this  skip it
Jul 10 2015,positive,if you go in to this movie comparing it to the original ghostbusters then youll be disappointed i went in to this movie with no expectations at all the trailers and marketing for this film were atrocious yet this movie is a lot of fun a lot of easter eggs for those who loved the cartoon i enjoyed this movie a lot
Jul 10 2015,negative,sadly very poorly done
Jul 9 2015,positive,i thought it would be a remake of the old one with girls but it was funny
Jul 8 2015,negative,long and not very funny  will join the long list of pointless reboots remakes or reimaginings like  red dawn point break total recall robocop friday the 13th a nightmare on elm street  fright night
Jul 7 2015,positive,i was really worried that this movie was going to be really bad my fears were not warranted they did a tremendous job i loved it
Jul 6 2015,positive,a character driven comedy that stands alone from its predecessors yet has plenty of somewhat awkward yet still fun winks to the original packed with banter driven humour wonderful performances and gorgeous cgi ghostbustersanswer the call is suggested by a huge tumblr following destined for cult status
Jul 6 2015,positive,i loved this new school remake the visuals were great the cherry 4 this movie is the old school appearances great job ladies
Jul 5 2015,positive,a nice and funny movie they put there own spin on it there was cameos of the origins ghostbusters in the movie over all it was not bad for a remake
Jul 5 2015,negative,half a star is already too much
Jul 5 2015,negative,when will they stop casting melissa mccarthy okay bridesmaids was funny but a fat person falling isnt funny every single time she does it which is every movie shes in please scrap this before you ruin one of the best franchises ever
Jul 4 2015,positive,eh not as bad as everyone said not as good as i had hoped
Jul 4 2015,negative,weak dialogs could have been more effects were ok
Jul 4 2015,negative,i wanted to like this but unfortunately i couldnt it was just not funny has none of the charm that the original does even seeing the original cast in it didnt help just awful
Jul 3 2015,positive,you know what i was wrong about this one its an understatement to say this movie was slated for the dumpster before it came out however i actually enjoyed it as a different take on the classic franchise not bad
Jul 3 2015,negative,this movie is utter garbage the only way this movie could get a good review is if sony is paying for reviews which i suspect is happening
Jul 2 2015,negative,the movie is just sort of a mess in multiple ways i didnt really have many expectations of biases before i watched it since i have yet to see the 1984 original but i still didnt find much enjoyment i will say a few good things the movie has going for it before i get into what i didnt like about the movie though i think there are some moments that made me chuckle and i like all of the actresses in this movie i think they do the best job they can with this dialogue still i never laughed out loud not even once i thought some of the actions scenes were kind of cool and the final act is watchable however with a talented cast like this and a director like paul feig i was pretty let down hes made comedies that have shown that women can be insanely funny and none of it shows here i also thought the structure of the movie was boring and repetitivei felt the same thing kept happening for at least half of it the effects are also pretty corny and the movie is extremely over the top i mean i dont ask for a movie like this to be realistic but it just comes off as very silly im all for more movies with predominantly female casts but i look at it as kind of a cheap shot when every single male character is either an idiot or just a jerk there is so much that can be done with a cast like this and they choose to remake a classic it just doesnt make sense to me i think the movie has a few moments that showed potential but overall this is easily one of the worst movies ive seen in 2016
Jul 1 2015,negative,this movie is going to stink
Jun 30 2015,positive,amazing these ladies were so funny and holtz just stole the showhard thing to do with such an amazing cast
Jun 28 2015,positive,i loved the movie and i hope they make a 2nd movie and brought family members with me and both of the family members loved the movie also
Jun 28 2015,positive,not bad i actually like the cast the cameos the effects the ghosts  i think that they missed the comedy mark a bit   with that many talented comedic actors writers and paul fieg as the director how come no one noticed that some of the bits were falling flat   still i smiled and laughed and generally enjoyed it   my theory is that people who dont like the movie at all l just dont care for the cast but i liked them
Jun 27 2015,positive,movie was better then id thought itd be better definitely not in the same league as the originals
Jun 27 2015,positive,might not have needed to be done but this was a good way to do it 75
Jun 26 2015,negative,this film is simply not funny not smart not entertaining and not worth seeing the actors are fine but the direction is terrible and script even worse i could not finish it and im glad i didnt try to see it in cinemas
Jun 26 2015,neutral,though it was a tad disappointing i still had a few good laughs
Jun 26 2015,positive,this ghost busters kills the original love it  good fun
Jun 25 2015,positive,good movie and entertaining the cast was hilarious especially kate mckinnon  she made the movie
Jun 25 2015,negative,i had semi high hopes for this movie as a small child i remember watching the original ghostbusters and loving both of them this is nowhere near close to the two original films i am sadly dissappointed to say that even with four of the funniest women comedians this movie was still a trainwreck this will go down as the jaws 3 of the ghostbuster films
Jun 25 2015,negative,love all the ladies in this film but its hard to actually see the film beyond some of the huge personalities i feel like ive seen the same performance from melissa mccarthy in all her recent movies personally i think it would have been better with actresses who can do comedy rather than comediennes who act not a patch on the original ironic that chris hemsworth was the funniest thing about this
Jun 24 2015,negative, this is the story of what happened
Jun 23 2015,negative,pretty poor movie my 5 and 3 yr old were into it so maybe the target audience was for them unfortunately
Jun 23 2015,positive,way better than i expected lots of fun
Jun 23 2015,positive,another good feig movie
Jun 22 2015,negative,this movie isnt worth my time to write out everything wrong with it but this review covers most of what i felt was wrong with this film  
Jun 22 2015,positive,hoping for a new ghostbusters 2
Jun 22 2015,positive,chris hemsworth was very convincing as clumsy idiot and saved the movie for me
Jun 22 2015,positive,when i was a little boy growing up in the 80s  one of my favorite things was throwing on my proton pack and chasing imaginary  ghosts in the back yard personally  i went it skeptical not because of the controversial full female cast but the casting in particular  of all of them kate mckinnon was the only one that could make me laugh on snl  i was proved  wrong as i was the loudest one laughing in the theater  they all made me laugh but kate definitely  stole the show if not temporarily outshined by the bafoolary of chris hemsworths receptionist  character   the lines were clever and funny saving the film from a boring plot and an even more boring villain  the film is packed with cameo after cameo from the original 80s film with a few funny suprises mixed in
Jun 21 2015,positive,not a bad editionpretty good flick
Jun 21 2015,positive,i just love the comedy of this team  make as many movies as you can yall
Jun 21 2015,positive,masturfully crafted film like feig only knows how to do the build up is good second act launches the girls into action jokes were not as punchy as i would have liked but youll understand why by the end of the movie hemsworths character is hilarious the ending was good feig did a good job
Jun 20 2015,positive,loved it few cameos here  there from first one
Jun 20 2015,negative,horrible movie horrible remake no more bad remakes  
Jun 20 2015,positive,its actually a lot better than i expected its no where near as good as the original but it still has some laughs and pretty fun action  b
Jun 19 2015,negative,it was terrible all great individuals dont always make a great cast so many issues i cant find where to start why wasnt hemsworth the villain all along rather some stupid idiot not even leslie jones and kate mckinnon could save this on their own
Jun 18 2015,negative,a few funny moments but overall this movie sucks
Jun 17 2015,positive,it wasnt as bad as i was afraid it was going to be based on the trailers but it wasnt as good as i wanted it to be
Jun 17 2015,positive,a fun and funny popcorn flick nothing life changing just a very enjoyable couple of hours
Jun 15 2015,negative,i like all the characters chris hemsworth was hilarious as the receptionist the story just didnt make me feel anything it was neither good or bad it was just a movie
Jun 15 2015,positive,as long as it does not have four ladies as the ghostbusters i will go and watch it
Jun 14 2015,neutral,i have to admit this movie didnt come anywhere close to being as good as the original installments the super ghost in the end was even lame there were several funny moments in the movie that kept me interested but was a flop overall
Jun 14 2015,positive,i was  like many instantly against this however i went and saw it and yes in some places it was slow  they did show alot of the good comedic lines in the previews though it did have its own merit and great surprises i would go see 2 as well
Jun 13 2015,neutral,though i do love how they added the cast from the original movie i thought it was a disgrace to the original one
Jun 13 2015,positive,65 entertaining nicely done better rental i forgot all about the originals these girls had good chemistry except the cameos i laughed a few times it was funny at times
Jun 12 2015,positive,the humor is inconsistent and it begs comparison to the original but this ghostbusters reboot still mostly stands on its own thanks in no small part to a hilarious performance by kate mckinnon
Jun 12 2015,negative,i wanted that movie to be goodbut it just wasnt an unfunny comedy is kind of the worst not sure where the critics get off giving this movie a 75  it was bad
Jun 12 2015,positive,being a fan of the older version of ghostbusters i was skeptical of this one however it delivered well
Jun 12 2015,neutral,online trolls should quit complaining and accept the fact that we have female ghostbusters now its not the horror most people have feared but its still not any good  movie review ghostbusters 2016  date viewed july 15 2016  directed by paul feig bridesmaids spy and the heat  written by paul feig and katie dippold  based on the 1984 film ghostbusters created by dan aykroyd and harold ramis  starring melissa mccarthy kristen wiig kate mckinnon leslie jones cecily strong andy garcia neil casey charles dance michael k williams matt walsh ed begley jr and chris hemsworth    who you gonna call the new female ghostbusters of course and online trolls should quit complaining this movie has been the target of public and media scrutiny for months when the first trailer arrived online it became the most hated film trailer in youtubes history come on people there are trailers for movies that are far worse than ghostbusters 2016 if you think the trailers for furry vengeance the oogieloves jack  jill dirty grandpa thats my boy and fifty shades of black are better than the trailer for new ghostbusters you are obviously not a movie fan or just mentally insane    its fresh to have director paul feig bridesmaids the heat and spy and a female led cast take over the ghostbusters franchise and this movie does have a lot of nods to the original but its still not any good its not the horror most people have feared but it lacks the fun and creativity of the 1984 comedy classic which was directed by ivan reitman and written by dan aykroyd and the late harold ramis the four comedic female leads melissa mccarthy and saturday night live alums kristen wiig kate mckinnon and leslie jones are the perfect team to take over for aykroyd ramis bill murray and ernie hudson but the main problem with this movie is that only two of the women manage to suck in the laughs mckinnon and jones are the ghostbusters who really standout for me mccarthy despite toning down her usual loud persona gives a performance that ranges from meh to nah and wiig who was terrifically hilarious in feigs bridesmaids doesnt have a whole lot to work with here    another reason why those online trolls and ghostbusters fans are angry is that the new movie takes place in a different timeline rehashing all memories from the original ghostbusters out of new yorks minds before they became ghostbusters drs and best friends erin gilbert wiig and abby yates mccarthy were coauthors of a book that details the existence of ghosts and paranormal activity when the book became unpopular gilbert distanced herself away from the ghost life and became a physics professor at columbia university    years later the book resurfaces on ebay and university president harold filmore charles dance lets her go because she believed that ghosts were real now fired from her university tenure gilbert decides to reunite with yates and form a ghostbusting business known as the department of the metaphysical examination gilbert and yates along with her engineer jillian holtzmann mckinnon open their office above a chinese restaurant they hire a moronic but handsome receptionist named kevin chris hemsworth and they recruit mta worker patty tolan jones to the team after she witnessed a ghost on the subway    after testing and trying out their new ghostfighting technology they go to a rock concert where a ghost is possibly on the lam they capture the ghost and the ladies brand themselves as the ghostbusters but new york mayor bradley andy garcia and city officials want to keep their actions quiet and label them as frauds the boring villain of the piece is rowan north neil casey an occultist who wants to open a portal to the supernatural world and release hundreds of ghosts so he could unleash the apocalypse    all of the elements from the 1984 original are still in place and has several cameo appearances from original cast members bill murray ernie hudson dan aykroyd annie potts and sigourney weaver but the new ghostbusters is uneven and the screenplay by feig and katie dippold the heat and spy is clunky and mediocre its nice to see chris hemsworth doing comedy but did the movie really have to make him this dumb  as for the special effects theyre not visually impressive in any way theyre just averagelooking and kinda cheesy    does the ghostbusters reboot work as a big summer movie its enjoyable to a certain extent i think paul feig shouldve gone back to the drawing board and craft a better script thats tighter and more faithful to the original
Jun 11 2015,positive,i had my doubts about a reboot but this film built a merrily spooky momentum toward an exciting and unexpectedly moving conclusion  cast chemistry was on point the action was deftly choreographed and the cgi which annoyed me in the trailers never trust a feig trailer blended surprisingly well with the 3d offering up moments of dazzling ghoulishness  i agreed with some of the reviews that pointed to minor pacing issues and a few clunky jokes but disagreed that the cameos dragged anything down  fan service ftw  amiright  maybe thats just me    my biggest complaint was the letterbox format of the 3d presentation it was so distracting i initially assumed it was a projection mistake and tracked down an usher to complain lo siento marisol  despite those quibbles it all came together with affective charm  i saw this with my family  belly laughs were had actual tears were shed and we all the left the theater smiling and chattering  i couldnt have asked for more than that
Jun 11 2015,positive,watching the trailers i was still giving it a chance reading the leaked plot onlinehonestly the way it was worded made me give up on it for the most part in the end i saw it was getting some good reviews from critics went and watched it expecting just an okay not bad nor great movie i have to say after watching it id lean even past the okay expectation i initially thought id have andit was pretty good it was kind of really good i laughed quite a bit and isnt that just all there needed i mean this isnt strictly a comedy film sure the original had a lot of great jokes but in the end its ghostbusters you expect to have fun and i did have fun and there were moments that rly surprised me that when intially read in the leaked plot had me disappointed but watching themthey werent nearly as bad as i thought 810
Jun 10 2015,positive,so funny hope there is a 2
Jun 9 2015,positive,i really enjoyed this movie they brought 4 of funniest women we have today into this film and their chemistry was great plus chris hemsworth was also a laugh riot b
Jun 7 2015,neutral,nothing special but kinda funny not as good as the feminists think but not as bad as the antifeminists think
Jun 7 2015,negative,if i could give less than half a star i would i had to turn this movie off after about 30 minutes it was that bad the promising cast is not to blame as these are funny actresses the writing was horrible there were fart jokes and what can only be described as illtimed middle school humor throughout the 30 minutes i watched i chalk this up as 30 minutes i will never get back and i feel the writerdirector should be ashamed to put their name on such a horrible film at the same time they cant hold all the blame as sony has come to be known as putting out horrible movies lately which is really a shame when they used to really put a good product out to market hopefully future producersdirectors dont hold this against the funny actresses
Jun 7 2015,positive,enjoyed the original crew but loved the way in upbringing the new female cast and leslie jones short comments had me rolling bill didnt really get your part in the movie especially when ya didnt help nor explained that you were the original crew or the story didnt go towards that but other than that im excited for a sequel
Jun 7 2015,positive,it was good played at the same pace as the original lots of good laughs
Jun 6 2015,positive,good cast and solid effects are lots of reasons why this movie shines sadly its rushed plot and hit and miss script wont be enough for some people but for what it is a fun comedy the cast can also be hit and miss for some people but personally i loved them melissa mccarthy chris hemsworth leslie jones cecily strong and especially kate mckinnon are great in this movie i sometimes felt kristen wiig although she made me laugh felt like a snl character she would play i would be excited to see this cast in future ghostbusters movies but i think its for sure the 1984 movie will always be the best but in my personal opinion i found this more entertaining than ghostbusters 2 i enjoyed it but it couldve been more original
Jun 5 2015,positive,welcome to a new franchise
Jun 5 2015,negative,total shit only good thing is holtzman character
Jun 3 2015,positive,i â kate mckinnon  she was the best part of the movie  overall a good remakereboot
Jun 2 2015,positive,definitely had fun in this movie im appalled by peoples commentary about it    dont think so hard just enjoy the fun
Jun 2 2015,positive,thoroughly enjoyable just had a few cringed cameos but also some good ones   chris hemsworth is such a ham and its great all four of the leading ladies had me in stitches
Jun 1 2015,positive,that wasnt that bad  it is ghost busters  just enjoy the movie for what it is  dont over analyze it
Jun 1 2015,positive,folks  please ignore poor reviews from wannabe user critic wankers this is a solid movie great castvery funnyand it gives you enough tidbits of the original to make you smile throughout enjoy
May 31 2015,positive,good movie like the new girls
May 31 2015,positive,i was very surprised by this movie i was very reluctant to go see this at first but after hearing so much positive reviews about it i thought i might as well give it a shot i liked how original this movie was it really wasnt copying the other two films it made a few references and had almost the entire original cast doing bit cameos and it was really funny i highly recommend this movie
May 31 2015,negative,its a kids movie i couldnt wait for it to be over thumbs down
