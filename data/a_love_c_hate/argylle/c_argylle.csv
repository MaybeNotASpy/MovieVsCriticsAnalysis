Apr 12 2024,negative, argylle comes home to apple tv as one of 2024s most embattled films reportedly acquired by apple for 200 million the film  the first in a hopeful trilogy from director matthew vaughn the kingsman franchise kickass  tanked at the box office and was on the sharp end of a whole lotta bad reviews its only saving grace may have been madame web stepping in a couple weeks later and inspiring an even greater vitriolic barrage but is argylle really that bad or is it another case of hype eclipsing the truth lets find out the gist we meet argylle henry cavill as he does what he does best dancing with an attractive woman and shooting and carchasing his way out of a scrape his superspy adventures arent really happening and i dont say that because the cgi looks so fake  no this sequence illustrates whats in the latest bestselling argylle novel written by elly conway bryce dallas howard she does a reading to her adoring fans then goes home to her very nice house where she dotes on her cat one of those designer felines with giant eyes and goofy little ears and annoys us by talking to herself a lot while she writes the next book she sends the draft to her mother catherine ohara who gives her some notes and has elly hop the train to chicago so they can work on rewriting that troublesome ending  but what elly doesnt realize is her life is about to change forever a scruffy longhair named aidan sam rockwell plops next to her on the train and before you know it hes saving ellys ass from a bunch of damn ruthless killers see aidan is a spy and hes protecting her from a secret spy cadre who wants to murder her because her books have somehow been predicting the future of all this subsocietal skullduggery and here we are about 20 minutes into this thing ready to punch this premise in the nose for being annoying and for bringing us out of the movie because were wondering how theyre going to explain this further complicating things is how elly looks at rockwellasaidan in action but sees the far more suave cavillasargylle doing all the fighting and shooting prompting us to question her perception and our reality and wonder how we can escape being privy to this tortured concept may i suggest turning it off and meditating in front of a blank screen alas i cannot do that duty calls so i dug in my heels and tried so very hard to care as aidan and elly go on the run to london and france and the arabian peninsula getting into scrapes and navigating so many twists and doublecrosses the movie should be sponsored by dramamine we get scenes of bad guy leader ritter bryan cranston screaming orders inside a movie command center dropin roles from dua lipa ariana debose john cena sofia boutella and samuel l jackson and a bunch of niceelaboratesetitdbeashameifitgotallshotup moments after a bit youll realize this isnt a henry cavill movie  hes in maybe 15 percent of it  but a bryce dallas howardsam rockwell buddy movie in which the director repeatedly tries to upstage them with the cgi pet cat who travels through this thing peering out of a backpack with a little window on it i mean vaughn is really enamored with the comedic potential of this cat and less so for his stars who might want to consider firing their agents after this one what movies will it remind you of sandra bullock played a writer unwittingly swept up into ludicrous adventures in the lost city and it wasnt particularly good but it at least made sense and inspired a few honest laughs memorable dialogue we all shout amen when aidan is debriefed on one of the plots stupidass twists and he replies thats the dumbest thing ive ever heard in my life our take the difference between madame webs badness and argylles badness is significant madame web was fronttoback incompetent while argylle is visionary with vaughn leaning heavily into his distinct brand of virtuoso obnoxiousness and as grating and loud as the last couple kingsman movies were argylle takes it a step or three further ratcheting up the spoofy goofing until the film becomes a mess of mealy satire wrongheaded comedy cartoonish action and a samuel l jackson gurumonologue about grapes thats supposed to be profoundly metaphorical but is the movie in microcosm tedious pointless and far far too long that vaughn intends to shoehorn argylle into the kingsman cinematic universe is enough to send one into furious conniptions although the film underperformed to the point where any planned sequels are likely being tabled as we speak although the actual budget of the film has been debated it feels like blankcheck filmmaking at its worst vaughns every indulgent whim seems to have been entertained the cgi is rampant and chintzy nobody bothered to edit the screenplay down to something coherent a small legion of talented actors is asked to do borderlineembarrassing things and the overall tone is irritatingly selfsatisfied vaughn concocts two thirdact action sequences that are simultaneously original and godawful showing us things weve never seen before and never want to see again within a relentlessly artificial antiseptic visual palette its easy to get upset when lovable talented actors like rockwell and howard are asked to do stupid things in the name of a misguided directorial vision theyre stuck playing phony characters who apparently are designed to be plot devices in a grandiose satire of spymovie tropes why else would the plot deploy so many ludicrous twists that deem to separate us from being emotionally involved with these people but its not particularly witty or observant and it leaves us feeling bewildered frustrated and bored argylle has the uneasy feel of a movie that seemed great in theory but just doesnt work in execution despite his insistence on style style style  albeit without the stylishness that would render it artful instead of egregious clowning  vaughns goto shot is of the cat reacting as all cats do to nearly everything withering ennui with a fringe of annoyance at least we can relate to that feeling
Apr 12 2024,positive, tv lovers seem to be eating good this month as sugar began its first season run over at appletv and both ripley and fallout have dropped their entire first seasons on netflix and amazon respectively the raves keep coming in so why did i choose sugar to watch first review below because i was able to binge it via the press site i no longer have an attention span thats able to wait two months to finish a show while also watching close to forty movies and other shows concurrently its too much information so the choice was more about beating the curve watching the show that i cant get spoiled on because no one else has watched it yet than anything else now i can hopefully settle into one of the other two before my social media feeds run rampant with memes clips and impressions that ive trained my brain to mostly ignore i take a mental snapshot of posts first and discern whether the title or an actor is included before deciding to actually read it its served me well so far the past few years a big true detective night country spoiler snuck through a few weeks ago but not having context made me think it was a joke  until i arrived at the episode and discovered it was true im thinking ripley is next maybe ill do a rewatch of the talented mr ripley first as its been over two decades since ive last seen it i enjoyed that film but never saw any of the other adaptations or read any of the books im mostly just an andrew scott fan and the same goes for fallout never played the game have zero clue about what its about but i love walton goggins and the tone seems like it should be a blast i barely have time to watch these i havent even begun shogun yet since im waiting to binge it upon completion so how could i ever find more to engage with source material too for fifteen years paul nicolas cage has kept his sons safe unlike most parents however that job isnt merely protecting them eating poison or running into traffic no paul has raised his boys in a postapocalyptic world wherein survival demands barricading oneself in for the night to avoid runins with violent creatures that hunt from dusk til dawn joseph jaeden martell and thomas maxwell jenkins are now at an age where they can help their father secure the farmhouse they now call home  and unleash a rebellious independent streak that just might risk all of their lives screenwriter michael nilon and director benjamin brewer have a decent premise with arcadian yes its pretty much a less successful a quiet place ripoff that sacrifices our investment in the characters for our enjoyment of action setpieces but theres still enough to grab onto so the ride doesnt feel like a total superficial waste after all its tough to toe that line and even tougher to do it correctly with less than ninetyminutes of runway rather than spend time with pauls family were meant to turn a prologue with him running to protect his twin babies beneath an underpass as all the love necessary for their present selves while its enough to earn pauls call to action when thomas doesnt come home the way his heroics play out is less about love than duty he must protect them even if it means risking his own life hell run out into the night and fend off as many beasts as he can to find his son and bring him back alive we believe it because paul is a stock character whose personality is dad cage does his best to make it more but hes mostly just going through the determined motions of a man whose life is expendable when compared to his kids it leads to some badass moments but very little emotion you could pretty much say that about the entire film all the interesting bits josephs analytical brain creating traps to study the monsters teases some cool potential only to be usurped by a generic sibling squabble serve the overall conceititself so bythenumbers and direct that it almost buckles in on itself before it can even attempt to hold up any weight because arcadian is all setup its an introduction to a world explained away by a childrens game guessing how the end of the world occurred hoping well stop wondering about the truth if were under the impression that the truth neither matters nor exists in that regard the film works martell jenkins and sadie soverall who plays charlotte thomass crush who lives with her parents in a community that doesnt trust paul carry the drama well as teens growing up fast and needing to implement everything their parents taught them onthefly to survive and the monsters are effective if also super weird gorillalike in movement with a sock puppet head that claps obnoxiously fast at its jaw hinge before attacking with a goo sack that dissolves and absorbs its prey their volatility match by humor when they latch together into a giant wheel rolling down the road by the end i found myself more excited about whats next than what i just witnessedthe opposite of a quiet place that one sets up a world through the eyes of a family while this sets up a family trapped inside a world and while nilon and brewer think theyve also done the former to make us care about paul and companys survival i just saw that trio as ancillary to the unknown they want us to enjoy the effects action and gore so much that they forgot to make the people engaged in those things more than twodimensional stereotypes of a demanding father good son industrious and bad son romantic an accident sparks a conflict all hell breaks loose the dust settles and we go home while argylle might be the dumbest of matthew vaughns films it still remains a lot of funsomething i cannot say for kingsman the golden circle i didnt even bother with the kings man the cast is game the music is good and the action toes that line between exciting and farcical to keep the audience engaged even if the motives and plot are as simple as simple can be because while the premise is great jason fuchs creates a writer who writes her spy novels so well that real spies want to use her to help them solve a mystery eerily similar to her fiction the almost twoandahalfhour runtime is mostly gags and redundancies attempting to trick us into thinking theres more than meets the eye the macguffin isnt even nuclear codes or an apocalyptic virus its just a dossier of the bad guys because the good guys wont believe they exist without one so just make one yourself since you already know all the information it contains i really liked the first fight scene with bryce dallas howards elly constantly blinking between henry cavills argylle dispatching villains with a calm smile and sam rockwells wilde doing so with much less grace howard and rockwells rapport is fun every iteration since they shift between allies and enemies multiple times and the driving force for the entire film considering the spy stuff is so onedimensional beyond its not so twisty twists the supporting cast is great too whether large roles catherine ohara and bryan cranston or small john cena and samuel l jackson but the special effects leave a lot to be desired the climactic snow patrol battle run as sung by leona lewis is laughably badand not because of the overthetop dance choreography the whole thing is shrouded in colored smoke created by awful cgi both in its visual authenticity and ability to interact with the actors thankfully an oil spill scene proves a tad better even if its iceskating finale is a literal cartoon as for the final shot and that midcredits sequence absurdly silly both in content and the intent to lazily retrofit this movie into a completely different franchise i cannot tell if its meant as a joke or truly a tease for more the most precious thing linda mélinée leclerc and her mother clotilde hesmes paulette have to remember her late father by is a green ring its been years since his death and the young girl still tries to sneak into her moms room to wear it to school on this day however paulette is at the end of her rope she orders linda to put it away so they can leave and when she returns home to find it missing she assumes the girl stole it anyway angry that her daughter lied and misplaced the jewelry paulette takes her to her sisters laetitia doschs astrid as a punishment only upon returning does she discover linda didnt take it after all sébastien laudenbach and chiara malta chicken for linda therefore truly begins with a display of mortifying guilt yes theres a prologue of lindas dad dying and an expository scene introducing the neighborhood and characters well soon spend a wild day with but its paulettes apology and promise to give linda anything she wants as redress that sparks the ensuing adventure because while the girls request of chicken and peppers her fathers famous dish should be simple besides the obvious emotions conjured paris happens to have begun a general strike shutting down all grocery stores so paulette must improvise what follows unfolds as one would assume before logical realism gets replacement by unbridled absurdity theres chicken theft an unmonitored oven ready to burn down an apartment complex a naked police officer and a watermelon delivery driver patrick pineaus jeanmichel who might just save the day with a little romance  if he survives not having an epipen linda and her young friends soon hijack the narrative with a willingness to do anything and everything to make this dish while the adults find themselves running around clueless about what to do half the time jeanmichels mother is passed out and astrid angrily binging candy beyond the humor and grounded fantasy so many people would be dead if this were real life though is a heartfelt story about two women struggling to connect in the present because of their inability to talk about the past because linda loving that ring as much as paulette has nothing to do with the ring all this girl wants is to remember a man she was too young to remember and while everything could be solved with a good motherdaughter chat a wholesome criminal romp has the potential to solidify their bond too because their undying love for serge should be what gives them the strength to move forward together its a wonderful message told with a bottomless wealth of entertainment and gorgeous animation the latter consists of mostly simple line drawings filled with solid colors to differentiate characters linda is yellow her friend green the police blue etc when the camera is pulled back the people become circles of those colors with their figures centered in the middle when the sun goes down everything switches to night mode with the line drawings becoming those colors so the black of their bodies can move against the black of the background add a couple songs making it a quasimusical and chicken for linda proves a compact lightningpaced and resonant lark the film starts with a scene of a young woman ramesha nawals mariam looking through the narrow crack of an opened door before it slams shut in her face we know some sort of violence is occurring on the other side by the sounds and her expressionjust not the who what or when of the event we can infer it has something to do with her mother bakhtawar mazhars fariha and grandfather since we cut to the latters funeral maybe she killed him maybe it was a scene from the past maybe theres no connection beyond the reality of pakistans widespread patriarchal oppression writerdirector zarrar kahn supplies that ambiguity with intent as his film in flames continues through a series of examples depicting just how insidious this malignant force of societal regulation is to the culture upbringing and existence of women in the country this is done overtly a man throwing a brick through mariams car window to try and grab her in the street or a man getting her attention before starting to masturbate in front of her and subtly fariha not marrying her daughter off so she can finish her medical degree or mariams hunch that her great uncle has only taken an interest in them because he wants to take everything his brother left them upon his death it also arrives via hallucination and nightmare where the aforementioned examples give us the unfortunate truth of the gendered dynamic at play in karachi kahn never forgets his opening and the trauma seeing such inferred abuse can inflict upon a viewer the result is an uncertainty towards what were watching onscreen and whether its real or imagined we see mariam imagining whiteeyed specters of men like her father in the distance before they disappear so does that mean other figures are all in her head too maybe the masturbator was an illusion maybe the fear that comes from always being seen as someone who can be exploited and duped has turned paranoia into delusion except reality doesnt lie kahn jams so many instances into the narrative that we know this paranoiaif it is paranoiais justified even if something isnt real it doesnt mean it hasnt happened before or wont happen later its a survival mechanism to keep mariams head on a swivel when uncle nasir adnan shah talks about documents that need to be signed or when asad omar javaid invites her on a beach date she must constantly weigh happiness against horror is her blossoming love for asad worth the risk that he might be hiding his true nature and if tragedy strikes leaving her alone to answer accusatory questions by men who will never listen to what she is saying anyway is it better to flee thats where in flames is most potent the blurred line between morality and selfpreservation if youre trapped in a system that treats you like the enemy you must resign yourself to the fact that no one else will save you you must save yourself even if it means exploiting the system exploiting you committing a crime or living with the ghosts of guilt and regret that result from refusing to become that ghost yourself it leads to some powerful moments of psychological distress that nawal performs to perfection as her mariam attempts to traverse this landscape of lustful and entitled men and it eventually gives mazhar the spotlight to shine during the second half as her farihas experience reminds her of her own power to seek justice outside the law what starts as a familiar tale of young love in the shadows of a domineering mother who does not approve soon reveals itself to be the nightmarish effect of how the rule often prevents us from pursuing the exceptions because we cannot afford to be wrong fariha isnt domineering she merely knows what awaits her daughter in this city and mariam isnt naive to want to feel the joy of asads company even if it means doing so in secret and at risk of their lives generational trauma is on full display as these women seek to succeed within the parameters their oppressors have set while proving the lengths theyll go to protect themselves and ultimately add to that heirloom of pain ray john magaro suspects nothing literally his wife megan stevensons stacylynn leaves almost every night without inviting him his brother matthew del negros junior is constantly buying new and expense things despite saying their company doesnt have the resources to give him a raise everyone he loves is screwing him and hes too much of a pushover to even consider the truth let alone do something about it if not for a joke of a private detective steve zahns skip recognizing stacylynn while staking out someone else at a seedy motel ray would have simply continued sleepwalking through his life skips decision to be a good samaritan and provide ray the unsolicited photos he took is the spark that gets shane atkinsons laroy texas going and its truly as mindboggling and funny a scenario as it sounds considering ray has no clue who skip is despite the latter believing they had a connection via school and his brother years prior ray wishes skip would have just minded his own business and not told him not that hes going to actually confront stacylynn about it hes too much of a coward for that so he buys a gun instead hoping to kill himself in the motel parking lot before she exits her room thats when fate intervenes in the form of a bag of cash you see someone has hired a hitman dylan bakers harry to take out a lawyer so he can steal the quarter of a million dollars in his safe believing that ray is the man he hired tiller brannon cross gives him the payment and address instead and since ray is at a crossroads of identity he takes both to force himself to see what hes really made of can he kill a man can he standup and honor his promise to get the money stacylynn needs to open a salon can he win her back cue the avalanche while laroy texass almost twohour runtime is a lot and the pacing does tend to drag when the melodrama of a delusional man who still thinks he can put his life back together takes over it does remain entertaining throughout credit magaro and zahns rapport for maintaining that interest because their odd couple pairing gets unhinged once they unintentionally fall into good copbad cop shenanigans stevenson and a supporting cast that includes brad leland and darcy shean shine in the overthetop caricature nature of their performances and baker really rounds everything out via a quietly menacing turn and i must admit that i enjoyed atkinsons decision to never fully lean into the humor when fleshing out his conclusion the film might not get as dark as it potentially should after a very effective prologue but the bleak nature of the finales justice does what it can to provide closure for the characters and the tone the comedy is mostly born from the actors and smalltown buffoonery of their roles rather than the scenario itself anyway so its nice that the cost of doing violent business stays as high as it must the end result wont necessary wow anyone or alter the genre but its a worthwhile ride to take on a rainy day the first two episodes of sugar are fantastic series creator mark protosevich is an obvious lover of film noir and he imbues his lead character john sugar colin farrell with that same romantic affinity this private detective is constantly thinking about movies to either help process his current predicament enthrall his latest audience or crack his next clue so not even sugars inner monologue can conceal the excitement of discovering that his next client is hollywood royalty in producer jonathan siegel james cromwellwhose granddaughter sydney chandlers olivia has disappeared its a cool premise with the enjoyable stylistic choice of splicing in scenes from classic cinema like the third man double indemnity and night of the hunter sugar is as nerdy as any cinephile gushing over his proximity to a legend and constantly trying to share his love for the medium later regaling his doctor with a description of the chest cavity scene from the thing its an obsession that complements his more general eccentricitiesincluding a level of empathy for the less fortunate so earnest that only a man of his physical prowess can get away with it because while sugar doesnt like to hurt people he will the noir beats sweetly quiet performance from farrell and intrigue of the case make the shows start utterly enthralling the hollywood types are pitchperfect jonathans stature and respect from the world makes him a flawed figure at home dennis boutsikaris as his son bernie is a mediocre facsimile producing third rate titles while keeping his junkie daughter and spoiled son out of the tabloids and said son david played by nate corddry is an entitled rich kid who never learned better yet doesnt earn our sympathy to use it as an excuse so when bernie and david actively try to sabotage sugar via their indifference to olivias plight we wonder if theyre somehow involved i love sugars code of moralitya stark contrast to the siegel clanthat goes further than just nonviolence he doesnt merely seek to do no harm hell go out of his way to fix the harm others have done he always remembers the names of those who serve him never pretends to be above another soul and always pays his wealth accrued from finding missing persons for powerful often dangerous people forward to those in need it leads to some genuinely heartfelt exchanges and commendable acts its no surprise everyone enjoys his company whether his equal or the help besides bernie and david of course sugar has an easy charm and honest demeanor hes a protector through and through and while he never wavers from this personality the show does soon muddy that charm a bit by giving us a reason for why sugar is the way he is first it starts with the tease of a bigger conspiracy at play one that forces us to question allegiances with people like kirby howellbatistes now credited simply as kirby handler ruby and then a fullblown table toss of a genrebending reveal that cant help overshadowing the simpler noir nature of the main plot thats not to say it doesnt all work or that the explanations are convenient rather than relevant protosevich and his team know what theyre doingits just a lot to process and a big shift in scope its also completely unnecessary this twist adds nothing to the whole beyond a reveal for viewers to talk about at the water cooler because its not a twist at all its crucial information about sugar and the world in which he lives that has simply been kept from us id argue the show would prove much better if protosevich led with this detail and let us enjoy the character choices through that motivation if i watched the season again right now knowing what i do im almost one hundred percent certain ill enjoy it more because i wont be forced to reconcile a rug pull that does more to halt momentum in its faux profundity than it does to add to it by allowing me to engage with the smaller focus and truly cherish it as a salve to the very dark places this case goes only to then widen the aperture to the point where olivia becomes a macguffin instead of the key to the puzzle you ensure im kept at arms length you have me feeling disappointed rather than energizedlike the show bit off more than it could chew when its really the decision to hide context hamstringing the whole from just being allowed to be itself i do therefore hope a second season is on the horizon because id like to know where things go without any cheap narrative manipulations in a bid to trend on social media regardless i still really enjoyed sugar and farrells work within step back from that structural misstep and theres a ton to like from the production value classic cinema angle and impressive cast amy ryan steals the show for me as melanie the one member of the extended siegel family with a heart because she effortlessly matches farrells performance beat for beat to foster a wonderful rapport and trust boutsikaris earns a memorable scene in the penultimate episode to steal some thunder for himself and the supporting cast that includes anna gunn eric lange playing a heavy with welcome humor and jason butler harner never falters its truly a solid season of television with the potential to get even better careful what you wish for because you just might get it is the sentiment that carries through ena sendijarevics darkly funny sweet dreams the cause and effect at play onscreen is never quite what the characters anticipate or hope for when they willingly allow themselves to be put into exploitative situations that they believe they can turn the tables on siti hayati azis embraces the midnight advances of her sugar plantations dutch owner hans dagelets jan because having his child rio kaj den haass karel means shell be untouchable in comparison to her fellow indonesian laborers agathe renée soutendijk lets her husband die because removing him from the picture will provide retribution for his infidelities and perhaps more control over the operation cornelis florian myjer and josefien lisa zweerman accept the formers mothers invitation to run the factory because being onsite should make it easier to sell everything off the dominoes therefore fall right from the first frame with jan teaching karel how to shoot a tiger and abuse the employees of which he resembles a lot more than his european father heres an indonesian boy being raised like hes white whose father the reason everyone allows it suddenly dies that leaves both wife and mistress in the lurchalthough agathe has the means to attempt solidifying power because of her position while siti doesnt quite know how much power she holds until the will is read and oh how sweet it is for cornelis to discover his father considers the illegitimate brother he didnt know existed to be his real son what ensues cant help being humorous because the ego and selfishness of the main characters demands we never get in their corner we want them to fall on their faces and fail to achieve their goals we want their preconceptions prejudices and fears to steer their actions towards selfdestruction rather than salvation because they deserve it only reza muhammad khan earns our empathy as a man perfectly positioned to understand the state of the world he laughs at the europeans mocks them to their faces and gets beatup for the trouble and all he wants is to take siti and karel somewhere else to be free if only thats what she truly wanted too instead of money and influence we do have pity for these tragic souls though pity for what money and status did to cornelis and josefienstunting their humanity at birth pity for siti only wanting whats best for her child despite her admitting in notsomanywords that having karel was a means to secure what was best for her and pity for agathe considering shes been stuck in a horrible marriage and hoped jans death might bring her calm comfort in the volatile place she now calls home despite everyone telling her she must return for europe before things get worse we pity them because they lost themselves to a system that ensured their demise this is colonialism and the horrible fingerprints left upon the conquered land and people by its hubris and totalitarian rule how sweet it is then that the familial chaos of jans death leads to financial chaos too once the scales tip via strikes and social unrest watching cornelis and josefien squirm is a delight because they know they need to sell now despite the means to be able to do so being too insidious even for them how then will it all end will reza find a way to save those worth saving will siti get cajoled into helping this family to ultimately help herself or will all their lofty dreams turn into a fiery nightmare this weekend sees brick lane 2008 mamas boy 2007 superhero movie 2008 three to

Mar 27 2024,negative, as a cartoonish riff on metafiction and absurdist action hijinks matthew vaughns argylle isnt halfbad it begins in spectacularly lousy fashion though with a calculated action sequence involving the titular british superspy henry cavill and his partner and tech operator wyatt john cena trying to get a macguffin of some kind from a sultry counteragent in gold lamé sofia boutella on a greek island the whole thing is calculated to feel contrived mixing and matching tired james bond cliches with overthetop digital action that doesnt even make sense within the world of 1s and 0s but then it is revealed that argylle doesnt really exist but is actually the fictional creation of megabestselling author elly conway bryce dallas howard whose series of superagent books currently numbers four and she is well on her way to finishing number five but something funny happens on the way to the final chapter as the reclusive introverted elly gets shanghaied on a train trip to visit her mother catherine ohara by a reallife spy or so he says named aidan sam rockwell who informs her that her books bear a striking resemblance to reallife spy shenanigans especially a supersecret organization headed by a man named ritter bryan cranston who really really wants her dead so in romancing the stone fashion elly finds herself drawn into a world of spy action that her books seem to have predicted at a meettheauthor event a fan asks if she is an actual spy like john le carré or frederick forsyth  bryce dallas howard taking a break from the jurassic world franchise plays the incredulous straight woman with good spirit and she is aided and abetted by the consistently amusing image of her carrying around her beloved cat alfie in a plaid backpack with a bubble window that ensures the wideeyed feline face plays for maximum comic effect ellys created world and the real world constantly collide as we see the absurdly squarecoifed argylle in action from time to time reminding us that there is some kind of deeper link between what elly types on her laptop and what actually unfolds in the clandestine spy world there are questions within questions and everything is eventually given some kind of answer with the only one really left wanting is how john cena could be wasted in such a minor role vaughn has in recent years dedicated almost all of his time to the everexpanding kingsman action movie series outside of his directorial debut the gritty crime drama layer cake 2004 which starred a pre007 daniel craig i have never really taken to his hyperkinetic style which is somehow overly slick and hammy at the same time it worked well enough on the superhero parody kickass 2010 if only because the ridiculousness of the material matched vaughns penchant for overkill he dials things back a bit here and some of the best moments are the screwball backandforth dialogue between elly and aidan the latter of whom never seems entirely trustworthy and at one point appears to be a secret enemy screenwriter jason fuchs i still see you certainly knows his way around genre conventions and he has fun with expected twists and turns and revelations including the timely appearance of samuel l jackson although it ultimately feels so airy and goofy that it loses it steam by the end  james kendrick offers exclusively on qnetwork over 2500 reviews on a wide range of films all films have a star rating and you can search in a variety of ways for the type of movie you want if youre just looking for a good movie then feel free to browse our library of movie reviews
Mar 24 2024,negative, argylle 2024 is about an unassuming author elly conway bryce dallas howard who writes spy novels about agent argyle henry cavill and is suffering from writers block as she approaches the book series end conways novels are renowned for correctly predicting future international events thus attracting unwanted attention from reallife spies which is why rogue agent aidan wilde sam rockwell intervenes to protect her and her scottish fold cat alfie chip from the division why is conway so prophetic with a runtime of two hours nineteen minutes avid moviegoers should be able to figure it out in the first five minutes which makes the movie one hour sixteen minutes too long the plot sounds reminiscent of sandra bullocks the lost city 2022 but i never got around to watching that flick writer jason fuchs claim to fame is creating the story behind wonder woman 2017 which was beloved but far from perfect director matthew vaughn had more success with some nice independent films like layer cake 2004 starring a young daniel craig stardust 2007 an underrated fairy tale which deserved more success and kickass 2010 a brutal reimagining of comic book movies before he settled into the commercial success but artistically vacant kingsman franchise which vary widely in quality after watching argylle you will wish that he continued building on the prequel the kings man 2021 regardless of how disturbing of vaughns alternate vision of historic world events are all the characters in argylle are archetypes which explains why so much money seems to be sunk into the film so viewers will not notice how boring it is elly is a retiring homebody who prefers to cuddle with her cat and facetime her mom than go out with a hot guy during melees in the blink of an eye she sees argylle instead of aidan fighting howard did some of her best work in this film but that is after being relegated to stinkers like the lesser works of lars von trier as a nicole kidman understudy in manderlay 2005 m night shyamalan in the village 2004 or lady in the water 2006 and the jurassic world franchise when she is memorable it is not work that one wants on their lifetime achievement montage a random vampire victoria in the twilight series or a racist villain in the help 2011 being a nepo baby may pay the bills but it does not feel rewarding if being a protagonist in a vaughn film is the zenith of over two decades of work it is nice to see rockwell take a break from playing loveable racists three billboards outside ebbing missouri 2017 woman walks ahead 2017 the best of enemies 2019 aidan is a version of rockwell from confessions of a dangerous mind 2002 a wisecracking dancing irreverent version of a spy rougher than the smooth talker british versions later in argylle he is a good sport for participating wholeheartedly in sly visual digs at his height in comparison to howard which makes him more affable the charm meter is off the charts and if the film works it is only because howard and rockwell have chemistry as players in the fighters to lovers trope argylle is overflowing with talent one standout is the delightful catherine ohara as ellys mom bryan cranstron plays a great villain as director ritter but the casting may spoil the twist also it is unfortunate that his conway novel equivalent director fowler richard e grant appears before ritter because he is a born scene stealer and simmers as a more magnificent bastard than ritter i ended up wishing grant had more screentime on behalf of cavill may i plead with future filmmakers to stop messing with his hair this buzz cut his mustache in mission impossible let the man be attractive ariana debose appears at bookends of the film as keira argylles q and is so criminally underutilized probably because she was giving too much butch sexiness in the final scenes that everyone would have forgotten that she was not the star sofia boutella as the keeper of secrets saba albadr was a waste boutella can fight so for a spy movie to just have her delivering lines should be illegal her chemistry with another spy was off the charts argylle was subconsciously a heavily queer movie and if its filmmakers were braver and less heteronormative they could have embraced it and put a cheeky twist on the spy film as opposed to the dour but gorgeous atomic blonde 2017 i preferred argylle the first time that i saw it when it was called a long kiss goodnight 1996 with a dash of keanu 2016 elly is agent rachel kylle when a mission goes wrong she lost her memory and the division brainwashed her she created argylle in a subconscious attempt to remember who she was wyatt john cenawas aidans fictional counterpart and aidan has been watching over her i did not love the mixed visual metaphor that argylle played in ellys real life she disassociates and hallucinates because of the traumatic accident and brainwashing she sees aidan as argylle but when she looks in the mirror she sees argylle as her reflection for the films premise to stick the landing she should be seeing cena in real life when she sees aidan the filmmakers made that creative choice because argylle is the ideal and they want the viewer to equate aidan with argylles mystique it is a case of having ones cake and eating it too they want the big twist for rachel to be the bad ass but fuchs and vaughn are not great at relating to or writing women so their sympathy and admiration fall more easily on aidan in the denouement the cliffhanger is whether rachel will betray and kill aidan at their core women cannot be fully trusted rachel and aidan were allegedly in love yet in ellys books argylle is only attracted to women and wyatt is his business partner ie there are no scenes where argylle and wyatt show any attraction let cavill and cena make out they never dosorry which lends credence to the idea that rachel was not into aidan there are two times when elly tries to kill kyle without any outside interference egging her on in the train during the first fight scene she aims the gun at him then she throws the grenade at him in bakunins hideout im not saying that rachel was not going to expose the division her cats namesake is alfred solomon samuel l jackson the former cia deputy director i just think that she was inclined to do it because of keira im not saying that they were an item but they could have been it felt as if rachel and the keeper of secrets were an item if argylle had any redeeming factors it was because rachel was a badass when she finally appears and it was nice to see a regular sized woman kick ass every rachel fight scene was top notch especially the combo of figure and speed skating on crude oil while bayoneting and slicing the bad guys i loved the technicolor smoke grenade fight sequence which is a convincing argument in favor of rachel and aidan being in love it was very james gunnesque also just a superficial side note i get the symbolism of hair color but can movies stop with making the warm nice character into redhead and the cold calculating killer into a blonde it is tiresome and howard looked better with red hair
Mar 21 2024,neutral,argylle is a charming and sometimes stunning action comedy with solid central performances and some memorable set pieces but the pacing and connective tissue dont work as well as it needs to
Mar 14 2024,negative, an actionpacked selfaware spy spoof from matthew vaughn sign me up or so i and perhaps you thought after directing the surprisingly funny and fresh kingsman the secret service i was hopeful that argylle would be a return to form with a similarly spytinged plot sadly for you and star bryce dallas howard argylle is a total bust howard stars as spy novelist elly conway who having just completed the fourth book in her argylle series is about to wrap up the spys next outing needing some help with the ending of her next book elly packs her beloved cat into an argyle backpack and takes a train to her parents house after her mother catherine ohara suggests a brainstorming session on the train she meets aiden sam rockwell who claims to not only be a spy but warns that a dark organization known as the division has put a target on her after her novels uncannily predict realworld events in the espionage world the film alternates between the imaginary world of ellys argylle novels with the fantastical realworld events here henry cavill with a haircut reminiscent of dolph lundgren in rocky iii stars in her daydreams as a super spy whose antics would make james bond jealous aided by a crack team that includes john cena and ariana debose ellys argylle daydreams seem to mesh with her new realworld predicament indicated through the obnoxious overuse of ellys point of view as shown through her blinking eyes cutting between ellys world and that of agent argylle at an exhaustingly frenetic pace the film feels as though it was created as a marketing campaign built on flashy visuals with brightlycolours and an overreliance on cgi argylle wears its welcome out quickly there is nothing of substance here and nothing for audiences to latch onto when whats at stake seems to change at breakneck speed plot twists give viewers whiplash as were thrust from one ridiculous scenario to another ellys realworld bears such little resemblance to our actual real world that tension never really builds into anything meaningful convoluted story threads eventually come together in a meaningless way as the film cant pick a genre or tone and stick with it tropes are stretched far too thin in jason fuchs script that by the time the movie begins to embrace its absurdity in its third act its far too late as aiden rockwell flits between austin powersesque zaniness and 007 stoicism and while its great to see howard land a lead role conway is such a bland wet blanket built on hapless writer cliches that viewers have seen before there was an opportunity here to send up these very cliches or turn a freneticallypaced spy movie into the new bullet train but argylle drops the ball at every turn its impossible to delve further into the many perplexing plot problems with argylle without giving several plot twists away equally baffling is that for a film that changes track so quickly the final product clocks in at an overlong 140 minutes dont be fooled by the films poster or trailer which boasts a bevy of alist stars like cavill cena and dua lipa their combined screen time amounts to less than five minutes of the film while other stars including ohara and bryan cranston are underused the story behind argylle is only mildly more interesting perpetual rumours swirled that elly conway the real mystery writer behind the actual book the movie is based on is actually taylor swift its utterly preposterous to believe that this pseudonym is anything other than a marketing ploy and not even a clever one at that and what of the marketing campaigns real star conways beloved pet cat alfie alfie is played by chip director vaughn and wife claudia schiffers cat yes thats right vaughn made an entire movie featuring his cat the cat is only featured in a few scenes and the rest of the time is replaced with an awful cgi cat that is so distracting when on screen its impossible to look anywhere else when its weirdly rendered paws are on screen seriously ive seen many cat paws and that is not what they look like all you need is death is the latest in the celtic folk horror genre that will appeal to fans of you are not my mother a hole in the ground and men in this unboxing video jason gorber checks out the joni mitchell archives volume 3 on vinyl and covers just what you get with this latest release
Mar 11 2024,negative, theres a current trend in new movies now showing in theaters and it appears to be on the rise call these early 2024 releases supercute cinema while awardsseason heavy hitters continue to open in south florida ahead of the 96th academy awards on sunday march 10 major studio offerings from the first several weeks of the new year have opted to double down on the silly let there be levity these filmmakers proclaim following a fall and early winter filled with prestige biopics sobering indie dramas and acclaimed european imports this critic is all for this change of pace a trio of new comedies run the gamut between teen angst fueled by macabre laughs globetrotting espionage with tongue placed firmly in cheek and a musical reimagining of a beloved high school satire from the mid2000s good intentions meet spotty execution lets dig in lisa frankenstein for her debut feature behind the camera zelda williams daughter of robin attempts to walk a tightrope between campy nostalgiadriven laughs and ghoulish romance the filmmaker is intent on putting a smiley face on pretty disturbing subject matter but the results come across as a jumble of underdeveloped ideas a rough draft for a better film especially to those who like me are totally on its happydark wavelength it helps that williams has entrusted screenwriting duties to diablo cody the oscarwinning scribe behind juno young adult and the underappreciated jennifers body the movie starts promisingly enough with our sullen protagonist lisa swallows big little lies kathryn newton fixated on a gifted 19thcentury pianist who met an untimely demise and is buried in the abandoned bachelors grove cemetery its not exactly a fake courtship since love isnt really part of lisas current headspace but her morbid interest certainly beats the dire situation that awaits her at home the year is 1989 and lisas dad dale joe chrest essentially recycling his stranger things role has remarried and moved in with his new wife the selfish and materialistic janet a game but underused carla gugino and her daughter taffy liza soberano in janets thoroughly pink suburban abode where is lisas mom hacked up to pieces by a masked psycho who broke into their home a piece of information that taffy lisas sole ally in this dysfunctional household casually discloses to her classmates at school the lingering trauma coupled with janets open hostility is too much for lisa to bear a fervent wish appears to align with a freak greenhued thunderstorm that brings the longdead musician from the dilapidated cemetery back to life sort of whats lisa to do when the lumbering undead creature riverdales cole sprouse who rose from his grave literally smashes into her home a shower and a makeover of course cue the fashion montage the results play as if desperately seeking susan director susan seidelman had remade tim burtons corpse bride with the genders reversed it sounds amusing but just when the movie should be kicking into gear you realize its running on fumes the fun quickly turns murderous for the pair as if heathers had been reimagined as a goosebumps episode but williams and cody are unable to mesh the body count and body horror elements with their pg13 rated sendup of teen comedies from the 80s also while newton shines whenever lisa is rediscovering her confidence its too much of a stretch to buy her as a socially inept outsider the filmmakers want to show you a good time but they havent really ironed out the story details beyond a grab bag of genre tropes and pop culture references so what were left with is 80s dressup with a committed cast occasionally clever production design and not much else going for it other than a winsome disposition the period details alternate between lazy taffys red yugo to onpoint lisas peachy keen wardrobe including a tshirt with the titular character of the comic strip cathy whats missing is more of a narrative glue holding these ideas together lisa frankenstein serves up cotton candy thing is i was really craving a strawberry milkshake  mean girls speaking of pink theres another teen comedy out there that leans heavily into nostalgia and is another feature directing debut tina fey has resurrected her thoroughly quotable foray into high school cliques and backstabbing maneuvers not only rebooting the 2004 hit for a new generation but integrating the songs from the broadway musical based on the original film if the resulting frankenstein monster stitched together from all these sources is not quite the misfire some would have you believe it still falls considerably short of the standard set by the older mark watersdirected film itself inspired by rosalind wisemans selfhelp book queen bees and wannabes first lets point out what works directors samantha jayne and arturo perez jr working from a screenplay by fey have ingeniously structured the film to make it unfold not unlike a theme park ride beginning and ending with a garage jam session by supporting charactersnarrators damian tony nominee jaquel spivey and janis moanas aulii cravalho in other words a film already brimming with queer appeal is frequently told from the point of view of the two queer characters as for this mean girls queen bee the vicious regina george pop star reneé rapp capably takes over the part made iconic by rachel mcadams as for her exboyfriend the dreamy aaron samuels cutie patootie christopher briney is as good as and even better looking than the original aaron jonathan bennett but as in the 2004 movie this remakeremix rises and falls by the ability of its lead actress to carry it and this is where the new mean girls doesnt make fetch happen on paper amy adams lookalike angourie rice hbos mare of easttown seems to be the perfect fit to breathe new life into cady heron north shore high schools newest student memorably played by lindsay lohan but rice wholesome but unremarkable alternates between adequate and nondescript it doesnt take long for the australian actress to slide into blandness its a shame because cady homeschooled and brainy is an engaging character and the contrast between her blankslate naiveté and the rigid social rules practiced by the plastics the trio of popular girls who take her under their wing is a combustible mix that draws blood in the original film alas not so much in its 2024 incarnation which amounts to a pale facsimile what does it say about a movie that casts jon hamm as the gym teacher and sexed teacher then gives him nothing to do argylle with these two underachievers fumbling the ball will director matthew vaughn come riding to the rescue dont count on it the bad boy behind kingsman and kickass has assembled a fearsome allstar cast featuring the likes of bryce dallas howard sam rockwell henry cavill samuel l jackson bryan cranston and catherine ohara but he has stuck them in an insouciant spy tale thats too convoluted and not nearly ridiculous enough to be much fun if only vaughn had bottled the cheerful absurdity of the films opening sequence argylle would have easily been a gas picture this a swanky nightclub a vivacious dua lipa as a dangerous dame and cavill as the titular secret agent wowing the crowd with their outrageous dance moves as barry whites raspy vocals hit just the right kitschy note a mission turns into an ambush an ambush leads to a daring escape and then we realize what were seeing is the closing chapter in a book by bestselling novelist elly conway howard whos out peddling her pageturner but is struggling to finish the next book as she starts thinking the time is coming for her suave yet wooden leading man to hang up his hat ruth ohara ellys momeditor is less than thrilled with the latest draft so she suggests a visit home so they can brainstorm neither elly nor alfie her fluffy predominantly cgi kitty make it home because on the train ride there they comes face to face with actual spy aidan wilde rockwell and vaughn working from an aggressively twisty screenplay by jason fuchs reveals what appears to be the movies central conceit that a reallife version of the evil syndicate elly depicts in her novels led by the dastardly director ritter cranston actually exists and the events she conjures up on the page turn out to predict what actually transpires in the web of intrigue where she now finds herself tangled up but as argylle careens from competently staged fisticuffs to oddcouple banter between elly and aidan the film moves farther and farther away from the freewheeling irreverence of its exhilarating beginning the plot rather than functioning as an engine to move things along grows so elaborate that it takes about as long to explain whats going on than it does to take the movie from one setpiece to the next it starts feeling like dead weight when something like this happens to a movie that initially shows promise i start looking for stuff on the edges and argyle does have a handful of incidental pleasures like oharas scenery chewing vaughns tendency to shoot the fight sequences like musical numbers coincidentally one of his future projects is reportedly a musical scripted by la la land auteur damien chazelle and hottie tomás paredes punching above his weight as one of ritters henchmen but these few bright spots only delay coming to terms with the sad reality that argylle while not nearly as lousy as you may have heard squanders enough potential to fill a john le carré novel it jettisons its pleasures in favor of an endlessly mutating brick wall of a plot the relentless rug pulling loses its capacity to excite or surprise lisa frankenstein mean girls and argylle are now showing throughout south florida in wide release including at regal south beach amc aventura silverspot cinema in downtown miami and cmx brickell city centre  theater the actor nominated for a tony award for his portrayal as mrs doubtfire in the broadway musical comes to fort lauderdale in the national tour michelle f solomon has the review
Feb 27 2024,neutral, outsized overdone and illconceived argylle takes what could have been a fun concept about mistaken identity amid hidden identity into a convoluted mess which consistently undercuts itself  is it a lighthearted spy film about james bondian superagent a metafiction comedy about real life and fantasy becoming mixed together  an action fable about both  yes no all of the above none of the above  no one can decide or seems to want to decide leaving nothing but an incoherent blob which stays far past its welcome and cant even make up its mind about an ending the beginning is pretty solid  not the starstudded action set piece it wants everyone to think the story is but the introduction to bestselling novelist elly conway howard creator of the ubiquitous agent argylle despite being a notorious agoraphobe who never flies or travels without her cat alfie and an overbearing nitpicking mother ohara she has nourished a global fanbase waiting breathlessly for her next spy epic  when some of those fans turn out to be real spies willing to kidnap elly to discover the plot of her next novel which seem to predict real world events with great accuracy  her only hope against the sudden terrors she has spent her life protecting herself from is rambling eccentric former agent aidan rockwell who needs what she knows as well and if it just stopped there that would be fine  howard and rockwell have strong chemistry and real comedic rapport  when nefarious agents of the directorate attempt to abduct elly from a train aidans sudden rescue attempt becomes a ragtag ballet of misunderstanding bullets and screams  the more confusing the situation gets and the more elly attempts to escape the better argylle is  if it stayed that way throughout slowly seeking out clues amid confusion and repartee that would be enough  but no one knows to leave well enough alone no sooner has elly escaped one confusing situation than she finds herself in the middle of more double crosses rescued by her own meddling parents creating the brilliant paring of cranston and ohara and intermittently hallucinating her own creation cavill trying to give her advice how to survive her increasingly dire situation  its all a hat on top of a hat on top of a hat  vaughn seems to have no faith in how long any situation can keep his audiences attention preferring instead to keep whipping the story around into new directions and then doing so again just as were getting used to the new status quo  its all built on the idea of reveal rather than revelation and forgets the law of diminishing returns the idea of howard in an actioncomedy gunning down evil doers is a good one but its so covered in meaningless twists and turns it loses its power and becomes a chore  eventually one that wont end as ever more secrets are added on even to the last moment  no one seems to know what it should be so everything is thrown at the wall desperately hoping for the final form to spontaneously manifest itself  its a waste of its main characters its a waste of its imaginary characters and ultimately its a waste of our time
Feb 27 2024,negative, there are a lot of questions swirling around the book argylle and its creation for starters its firsttime author elly conway is a mystery with rumors continuing to swirl that shes actually taylor swift the story of its publication and how deeply connected it was to director matthew vaughn remains unknown though within the first few minutes of watching the film version of argylle it seems pretty clear that vaughn had to be a key player in it being written in the first place its one of the first truly bizarre elements in watching argylle which tells the story of mildmannered author elly conway bryce dallas howard author of the book series on which the film is based elly is a loner who in spite of her fame and success enjoys spending her days living on the lake working in her pajamas and being a cat mom to the darling alfie but while on a train to visit her parents elly meets aidan sam rockwell a spy who tells elly the stories in her books are true and that people are trying to kill her  to say anymore is truly difficult because of how many different turns argylle takes in its nearly twoandahalf hour runtime the book version of argylle out now actually has a plot focused on its titled character played onscreen by henry cavill in a severe haircut whereas this film only uses the character as a launchpad to showcase a fictional  version of conways life howard is so charming and magnetic onscreen as elly a kindhearted if very shy and anxious author who is so committed to her work she tells a handsome guy to sit in a different area of the train  but once elly meets aidan the film turns into typical vaughndirected fare albeit with a more subdued pg13 rating rockwell and howard have great chemistry particularly in the third act when ellys backstory is properly revealed the pair dance and fight with one needle drop  to leona lewis version of run  easily making its way into this writers best moments of 2024 howard especially gets to have a strong leading role as the movie goes on with numerous opportunities for both comedy and drama its almost enough to make you forget that cavill himself is on the poster of this movie as the lead outside of rockwell howard bryan cranston and catherine ohara as ellys parents the other alist actors are given only a few brief scenes cavill john cena and ariana debose open the film as the characters elly writes about but are as flat as they are on the page cavill though at least has fun with the character throughout the film elly sees argylle in moments where aidan is fighting in a fun expectation vs reality twist where aidan is sweating and being thrown around argylle is fixing his hair and acting like bond  though as the film goes on  with a runtime that feels at least 30 minutes too long  cavill goes away leaving howard and rockwell to go on a series of globehopping adventures to find a shadowy master key containing the agents of an equally shadowy rogue entity known as the directorate there are several needless moments of whos zooming who that gets repetitive but again its great to see howard get a meaty leading role even if she spends the first half whining and crying  argylle though is just too convoluted for its own good in order to avoid backing itself into a corner the second half of the movie takes a sharp turn by explaining something about ellys past that undoes everything if elly has such a dark history how did she obtain a fivebook deal with a publisher especially if what she knows is so dangerous why allow her to become a huge star with a massive social media following  that is only used as a gods machine to find her in certain instances there are also far too many scenes of elly switching allegiances some based on miscommunications and others based on contrived plot devices and the assumption that this is part one of a series of films seems a tad confusing is this a series of argylle adventures the adventures of elly conway some hodgepodge of both because if this film is a proof of concept the argylle conceit has more possibility than ellys story no matter how good howard is in the role  argylle is fun in spurts with a strong cast of characters that help you get through the overly exaggerated runtime but the script boxes itself into a corner too often and falls into repetition howard and rockwell have fun but they carry the movie leaving little meat to work with for future adventures 
Feb 26 2024,positive, matthew vaughns latest action comedy follows bryce dallas howards elly conway a writer who found success with her argylle novels her five books detail the titular agent argylles search for a very important master file and the books scenes come to life on screen with henry cavill playing the dashing agent argylle  but  plot  when ellys books start to mimic real life a bit too closely sam rockwells slightly lessdashing agent comes to the rescue and sweeps elly and her cat alfie on a globetrotting adventure that keeps getting more and more ridiculous from the off there is a boldness to vaughns film a boldness to be silly unserious and most importantly dumb argylle more than anything is peculiarly endearingly stupid in good and bad ways that said the biggest mistake vaughn and screenwriter jason fuchs make is to assume their audience isnt able to figure out the twists and turns of the story approximately 35 minutes before they happen  argylle seems to want to be a film that is able to pull the rug from under you several times during its bloated unnecessary 139 minute runtime none of the surprises feel that surprising vaughn handles them all with a heavy hand and too many visual clues argylle is the cinematic equivalent of being hit in the head with a hammer then someone checking youre okay then hitting you again  thankfully vaughns cast is very much in on the joke sam rockwell is great fun as aidan the spy who swoops in to save elly as a bunch of bad guys try to kill her on a train bryan cranston is always dead good as a villain and henry cavill a very underrated comedic actor proves that he would have made an excellent james bond  yet argylle is supposedly ellys story unfortunately though howard isnt awarded much to do or to work with while some of it is by design elly is such a blank canvas of a character that its near impossible to be attached to her all of the films female characters theres five in total either have only a couple of minutes of screentime or are reduced to damsels in distress  howard is a sympathetic lead but the problem lies to my eyes within the script argylle is largely marketed as a henry cavill vehicle even though the man of steel actor plays a supporting character yet this is very much ellys story of finding her own courage and breaking free from her timid anxious personality and embracing her role in this massive espionage conspiracy  argylle has an awful lot of plot but very little story the universe never feels properly lived in and the characters lack a lot of history argylle is much like christopher nolans tenet both films were forced to constantly explain what was happening to the audience because there was more plot than the respective directors knew what to do with  like tenet represented christopher nolan at both his worst and his most ambitious argylle is a bit of an enigma for vaughn the film directed with maximalism by vaughn includes some of his worst instincts as well as his best argylle has a frustratingly formulaic plot and thin characters but theres also excellent fight choreography and a riotously fun dream ballet of violence argylle clearly designed for the sanitised masses also suffers greatly from the lack of gore in fact its a completely bloodless and thus toothless affair  theres a great film somewhere in argylle but on this occasion vaughn hasnt been able to draw it out its a chaotic thrill ride with truly terrible cgi that gets exceedingly dumb as our patience wears thin but id be lying if i said i didnt have a good time  to provide the best experiences we and our partners use technologies like cookies to store andor access device information consenting to these technologies will allow us and our partners to process personal data such as browsing behavior or unique ids on this site and show non personalized ads not consenting or withdrawing consent may adversely affect certain features and functions click below to consent to the above or make granular choices your choices will be applied to this site only you can change your settings at any time including withdrawing your consent by using the toggles on the cookie policy or by clicking on the manage consent button at the bottom of the screen
Feb 24 2024,positive,goes overboard towards the end but it is a fun trip up till then
Feb 23 2024,negative, a certain subsection of taylor swift fans spent this past january advancing the theory that she had written the script for argylle theres some reason to think this  apple films drummed up publicity for the movie this past fall by publishing  a real novel under the name of its main character elly conway and created some fake social media profiles for her when the trailer went public fans noted the resemblance between the short red hairdo on elly bryce dallas howard and the wig that swift wore in  her all too well video swift does have a pretty funny history of working under pseudonyms and she resembles elly in being a devoted cat owner all this was enough for some people but i never believed it just as i never believed the nfl rigged the super bowl for swift or that she was secretly gay or that paul mccartney has been dead for 50 years or that stevie wonder has been able to see this whole time if i do find out that im wrong and she wrote this ill be very disappointed because this comic spy thriller is tedious and a lot less clever than it thinks it is elly lives quietly with her cat in a cabin in colorado where she writes a successful series of spy novels about the dashing agent argylle henry cavill who repeatedly saves the world from mad scientists and nefarious billionaires while shes traveling by train to visit her mother catherine ohara a stranger named aiden wilde sam rockwell comes up to her dressed like a homeless man identifies himself as a spy and proves it by killing an autograph seeker along with a bunch of other armed people on the train who are evidently after her the first sign that all isnt as it seems is during the fight when elly keeps hallucinating argylle doing the fighting instead of aidan the film starts promisingly enough with aidan pulling a terrified elly through the streets of london to a villa in the south of france while she demands to know why theyre being shot at the problem is that director matthew vaughn and actual screenwriter jason fuchs  he also portrays the moderator at one of ellys book signings  are too much in love with their plot revelations ellys entire life turns out to be a lie a plot devised by the former cia director bryan cranston whos employing one or more of her allies and may be a pawn himself argylle also continues to appear to elly to give her advice on how to get out of her jam a spy named keira ariana debose is a character in ellys novels but then turns up in her real life as well then comes the point when aidan without warning throws a punch at ellys face and shes more surprised than anyone when she sidesteps the blow and judoflips him over her shoulder some fans are touting this as a new meta way of telling a story yet i kept feeling touches derivative of better spy movies before this vaughn has shown the abilities to be darkly funny and orchestrate an action sequence but here the mix is entirely off the comedy intrudes when the movie needs gravity and the movie takes itself too seriously when it needs to be funny the climax just piles set piece on top of set piece and while some of them might have had an impact in a more judicious movie they add up to too much of the same thing here the supporting cast is stacked  john cena as argylles tech guy dua lipa as a femme fatale samuel l jackson and sofia boutella as people who know argylles real identity  but the movie makes poor use of all this star power even the great rockwell is off his game which is how you know its all gone very wrong on paper this film probably looked like a blast of thrills and meta comedy but on the screen it fails comprehensively on every score
Feb 22 2024,neutral, bear with me on this one bryce dallas howard plays elly conway a successful author whose espionage series argylle has captured the imagination of america in the book series agent argylle and his partner wyatt  played by henry cavill and john cena respectively in dramatizations of ellys novels  are on a spy mission to track down a masterkey were getting lazy with the macguffin naming eh to expose the division the de facto bad guy organization that does nondescript bad guy things as elly struggles with writers block to complete the fifth book she takes a train to see her parents and meets aidan sam rockwell a good guy spy in the real world who informs her that her books have inexplicably mirrored actual events the good guy spies and the division have been tracking elly down to find out how agent argylles mission concludes and therefore how their mission concludes the entirety of the movie plays out like a bad spy novel from the dialogue to the fight scenes to the mugging for the camera with director matthew vaughn and writer jason fuchs presumably taking the piss out of the genre  and to their credit a lot of the stupidity of the premise is explained in a decently fun way theres no question that vaughn understands the genre and can create a properly entertaining spy movie amusingly his actual abilities as a filmmaker inhibit his ability to make argylle what it so desperately tries to be an unserious romp stupid movies are a grand cinematic tradition some of the most enduring and endearing stupid films drown themselves in brilliant stupidity but to do so requires careful crafting and ingenuity argylle rests on a b movie idea that requires so much setup and explanation it muddles the stupid for two hours we agonizingly try to parse through the drivel and the competent internal pleadings for the film to mercifully end go unanswered and another pointless sequence begins by the time we reach the films ridiculous conclusion little fun is to be had and patience is incredibly thin not for nothing the entire ensemble knows exactly what kind of film theyre in and go for broke playing up their stereotypes it almost makes matters worse how talented the cast is given what a fruitless endeavour vaughn tasks them with howard rockwell cranston ohara and cavill approach the film with a broad simplicity that vaughn lacks and the movie sorely needs what made the kingsman films the first one in particular so successful was vaughns unwavering commitment to the bit and perhaps argylle couldve come out on top had he done the same here commit to the stupid
Feb 20 2024,positive, the movie is about taking down an evil organization bent on taking over the world through violent means but in the long run its hard to say that the movie has any deeper meaning elly starts out somewhat helpless but eventually finds her strength and her agency but even the heroes including elly are spies who lie and kill people of the nine most prominentfamiliar actors in the cast one is a black man samuel l jackson one is a woman of puerto rican and african american descent ariana debose one is an english and albanian woman dua lipa two are white women bryce dallas howard and catherine ohara and the other four are white men the main character is howards elly conway whos slightly bigger than most ultrathin female action heroes elly starts out somewhat helpless but eventually finds her strength and her agency and is able to save the day lots of peril martial arts fighting shooting and explosions but very little blood or injury shown fights with knivesblades many secondary characters are killed a character takes poison and dies by suicide person tied to chair and punched repeatedly vehicle chase with lots of crashes man grabs woman off the back of motorcycle a character is taught how to crush a human skull with a foot a cat is thrown off the roof of a building it lands safely brief kissing a character uses the phrase pop that cherry a woman calls a man a pervert characters do a dance move called the whirlybird initially a man lifts a woman up so that her legs are on his shoulders and his face is close to her crotch then whirls her around in circles in a later scene she lifts him up a use of fk plus sporadic use of st bullst ahole son of a bitch goddamn ass dk friggin scumbag crap hell exclamatory use of jesus and god several bottlesglasses of alcohol on display in offices in nightclubs on a plane on desks etc but very little actual drinking one character encourages another whos nervous about flying to try alcohol it helps parents need to know that argylle is a lightweight but fun and twisty spy thriller with comicromantic moments about a novelist bryce dallas howard who becomes the target of rival spy organizations when her books start to mirror real life its from the director of the kingsman movies but is much less graphic than those films still there are lots of scenes of peril largely bloodless fighting and shooting attacks with knives and blades explosions and a vehicle chase with crashes a character is tied to a chair and pummeled another dies by suicide and a cat is sometimes in danger theres brief kissing mild sexrelated dialogue and some sexy dance moves sporadic language includes one use of fk plus st bullst son of a bitch goddamn ass dk etc bottles and glasses of alcohol are seen throughout in clubs offices planes and more but theres very little actual drinking sam rockwell and henry cavill costar to stay in the loop on more movies like this you can sign up for weekly family movie night emails as argylle opens superspy argylle henry cavill is on another exciting mission tangling with the deadly lagrange dua lipa with help from his stalwart colleagues wyatt john cena and keira ariana debose but it turns out that theyre all characters created by elly conway bryce dallas howard a neurotic but successful novelist who spends virtually all of her time alone with her cat alfie on a train to visit her mother elly meets aidan sam rockwell who at first professes to be a fan but is actually a reallife spy when an attempt is made on ellys life aidan dispatches an army of attackers and saves her from the train she learns that shes being hunted by an evil organization called the division which is led by director ritter bryan cranston because her books have come a little too close to the details of reallife spy operations as a result both aidan and the division believe that elly might know something about an important file thats gone missing simultaneously cleverly complex and gleefully shallow this slick twisty spy movie borrows bits and pieces from earlier movies but links them together in a surprising and entertaining way after his three ultraviolent kingsman movies director matthew vaughn working from a screenplay by jason fuchs finds a slightly gentler less gruesome tone with argylle few innocents die here other than minions working for the evil organization and vaughn doesnt try for breakneck speed but rather spends time on characters and downtime trying to come up with the next move for a long movie 139 minutes argylle has a nice pace and its not exhausting theres also a striking contrast between the perfect sculpted fictional characters in ellys books and the more flawed reallife characters that feels right and while it seems to have sprung from the seeds of romancing the stone its more progressive giving elly more to do and to ponder than simply falling in love with the hero maybe argylle isnt about much of anythingeven the kingsman movies tried to tackle subjects like war drugs and climate changebut its an appealing ride that checks all the right boxes and goes well with a bucket of popcorn families can talk about argylles violence how did it make you feel was it exciting shocking what did the movie show or not show to achieve this effect why is that important do you consider elly a role model how does she change over

Feb 20 2024,positive, matthew vaughn is a visionary director who has contributed immensely to the superhero film genre xmen first class reinvigorated the franchise and kickass is easily one of the best superhero movies of all time however his latest in argylle fails to live up to those other films and despite some typical vaughnisms the movie is very disappointing  vaughn is also responsible for the kingsman movies the first film in that spy universe launched the career of taron egerton who has gone on to become one of the most interesting actors in the industry but vaughn followed it up with additional kingsman sequels that were never as good as the original vaughn tries something new with argylle but despite a fun cinematic experience the movie is pretty disappointing  argylle starts as one of those meta movies where a fiction writer becomes involved in a reallife adventure like the ones she writes about its meant to invoke movies like romancing the stone or the more recent sandra bullock movie the lost city however theres a big twist in argylle where it separates itself from those movies but dont look to me to spoil what the twist is in this argylle review  argylle on its own is an enjoyable cinematic experience vaughn is good at innovative action great camera work amazing cinematography and effective use of appropriate needledrop moments its a riproaring good time of explosions humor and goodlooking people doing cool things but outside of that the movie doesnt offer much else  the story is engaging enough to keep you hooked for most of the film the big twist and reveal are interesting albeit a little convoluted the third act of the movie is completely unnecessary and loses the audience add to this some plot points that get an explanation immediately after we see it for example without spoilers a good supporting character turns bad and we get an immediate flashback revealing why and how so audiences cant even begin to process the twist before any tension from it is defused and we move on to the next unnecessarily complicated plot point and this happens a lot argylle has a stacked cast but id be remiss in this argylle review if i didnt point out that many of them do absolutely nothing the main leads of the movie are bryce dallas howard and sam rockwell and this is the thing that makes argylle engaging and keeps you interested its all howard howard is the gem in argylle that makes you want to keep watching she is charming effortless and the heart of the movie and when she is with rockwell its dynamite while the pairing is good rockwell feels like hes phoning it in dont get me wrong its a lot of fun seeing rockwell do typical leading man things smashing through a floor and taking out bad guys in one fell swoop but in the quieter moments rockwells performance seems disconnected from anything going on when theyre together howard feels like shes in the moment whereas rockwell feels like he wants to leave the chase scenes and action sequences with rockwell and howard are a lot of fun but without major stakes it feels like theyre just going through the motions in the story and thats where the movie loses me completely  ultimately all these problems wouldnt be as big of an issue if the main story of the movie had a point if the emotional arc and journey of the protagonist convey some sense of danger or risk if the main plot was big enough to rationalize all the craziness that precedes it or had consequences that felt enough important enough for us to care but ultimately none of those things happen in argylle the macguffin that drives most of the plot and the subsequent consequences of it are so insidebaseball specific to this world of spies that its difficult for audiences outside of it to care about it and there are so many plot twists happening so often that even after everything has a resolution were left with a sense of wondering if this is even real to begin with the convoluted plot is the movies downfall  argylle is fun enough to watch in theatres the grand spectacle of vaughns stylized action sequences is a lot of fun to watch on the big screen even after its soontobe streaming release on apple tv it will be an enjoyable group movie with family or friends but looking for anything beyond a superficial good time isnt recommended  argylle is now playing in theatres what did you think of argylle let me know in the comments below and follow me on x twitter at theshahshahid for more new movie reviews   when the plots of reclusive author elly conways fictional espionage novels begin to mirror the covert actions of a reallife spy organization quiet evenings at home become a thing of the past accompanied by her cat alfie and aiden a catallergic spy elly races across the world to stay one step ahead of the killers as the line between conways fictional world and her real one begins to blur

Feb 15 2024,positive, most critics dont seem to be fans of matthew vaughns new action comedy argylle but luckily im in the minority of those who had a blast with it the film is about an introverted spy novelist played by bryce dallas howard who is drawn into the activities of a sinister underground organization its best not to reveal too much about the plot because there are so many great twists and turns and audiences might even be surprised by the direction of the film from the beginning what i can reveal is that this movie is a silly and outlandish adventure that pokes fun at the spy genre much like the kings man films which this romp may or may not be connected to vaughn doesnt always hit his targets and though this film is long and could easily have 30 minutes trimmed from it argylle is a creative screenplay that is elevated by its allstar cast which along with howard includes sam rockwell henry cavill dua lipa and samuel l jackson  some may argue the film doesnt feature enough of cavill but i am all about the incredible chemistry between howard and rockwell the two emotionally and literally light up the screen with their comical banter they provide an unexpected romantic comedy element that enhances the story and forgives any flaws its best to not take this film too seriously just allow yourself to enjoy the ridiculous ride argylle is a fastpaced witty and actionpacked spy comedy thats well worth seeing on the big screen susan kamyab is a dallasbased television and online film critic producer reporter and writer since 2010 shes been reviewing for irving television ictn and online at thischixflixcom
Feb 15 2024,neutral, from the uberviolent uberbritish kingsman to the remarkably prescient but similarly bloody kickass matthew vaughn has carved a clear niche for himself as the goto director for ridiculous highoctane action comedies his latest effort argylle bears the same stylistic signatures as his earlier works cranked to elevenmore twists more gags more ridiculous fight scenes but while a starstudded cast may do their best to bring heart and humor to this meta spy mystery argylle ultimately buckles under the weight of its own ambition and the end result is a messy overlong if entertaining romp  starring bryce dallas howard and sam rockwell argylle follows elly conway howard the reclusive ultrasuccessful author behind the argylle novelsa series of spy mysteries following a debonair secret agent henry cavill when ellys novels begin to inexplicably mirror the highstakes lives of a real espionage organization shes thrown into the middle of a dangerous power play with the mysterious rougharoundtheedges aidan rockwell and her cat alfie as her only allies previously vaughns particular brand of guffawinducing humor and gravitydefying action scenes have yielded some gems striking the perfect balance between ridiculous and selfaware but in its desperation to get ahead of the viewer and deliver a colorful twistfilled joyride argylle gets lost in the tide of its own plot contrivances at a whopping two hours and 20 minutes argylle assaults the viewer with twist after twistby the time the films last finale rolls around any novelty or goodwill the first hour inspired is completely gone its a shame too because the first act sets up a silly but simple premise with a pair of extremely likable characterselly and aidan are a perfect oldschool oppositesattract duo made all the more electric through rockwell and howards chemistry the early beats of argylle also use a dream sequence mechanic to weave cavills agent agylle into the story through a series of clever editing choices but somewhere around the halfway point argylle begins grinding its gearsthe action sequences begin to overstay their welcome the dream sequence mechanic is all but forgotten and the ellyaidan dynamic is disrupted by a twist that seems to exist purely to pull one over on the audience though the bones of argylle are undoubtedly intriguing vaughns overindulgence puts form over function resulting in an entertaining but ultimately misguided actioncomedy pg13 139 min

Feb 13 2024,negative, bryce dallas howard from the jurassic world franchise is elly conway the author of a series of bestselling spy novels her books center on secret agent argylle henry cavill and his mission to unravel a global spy syndicate the film gets interesting when elly is traveling by train with her cat alfie she meets aidan sam rockwell a real spy and the fantasy adventure begins director matthew vaughn of the kingsman movies creates a new chapter to his spy genre and his kingsman the secret service films the latest spy character argylle henry cavill is excellent and lots of fun hes the archetypal spy with his gallant good looks british accent and the ability to of course conquer all his team is ready to help behind the scenes to aid in his escape plan john cena and ariana debose play them he can escape any situation as he has for four different adventures that elly conway wrote shes out promoting her fourth novel while putting the finishing touches on the fifth book ellys books have oddly predicted what happens in the real espionage world getting back to aidan the spy is dressed like a homeless person he tries to warn her shes in grave danger and that an evil group is out to use her to predict where some dangerous codes and files could be located yes shes way over her head as life imitates art and she has no one to trust except her cat alfie going into survival mode her action scenes are incredible to watch as she fights for her life by robot kicking and punching her way out of each situation unfortunately the main problem is the action scenes need to be shorter causing the movie to become boring theres potential for the film to become a franchise as argylle does keep you guessing until the very end although the less is more approach would garner better results here i did enjoy watching bryce dallas howard and sam rockwell together although they couldnt save the film the movie also stars john cena catherine ohara bryan cranston samuel l jackson ariana debose and dua lipa
Feb 13 2024,negative, the main character is elly bryce dallas howard a bestselling novelist who writes about espionage she lives alone with her scottish fold cat named alfie who joins her when she travels for presentations to her adoring fans she is afraid of flying so when she encounters writers block as she tries to end her latest book she takes a train to visit her mother catherine ohara another passenger named aidan sam rockwell takes the seat across from her hes reading argylle her latest book thats also the name of the spy played by henry cavill she created and whom she sees throughout her adventures with all of its twists and turns and every cliché ever included in a spy movie youd think this would be exciting its not just because its references other movies doesnt mean this screenplay is funny or clever although there are some entertaining comical moments most of the attempts at humor fall with a thud imitation without wit does not a parody make the whole movie appears to have been produced by ai and cgi  even the cat which i imagine was supposed to relieve the tedium looks like its a cgi creation in nearly every scene to have a successful garden you need to know when it is the best time to plant here are the best plants to start in may
Feb 12 2024,neutral, this is paul salfen with your klak movie minute in theaters now is argylle a fun starstudded little spy romp about a fictional spy named argylle played by henry cavill thats a figment of an authors imagination who gets swept up into a real life spy novel situation when characters try to track her down and extract whats going to happen next to get ahead by forcing her to write its a pretty creative romp from director matthew vaughn with some funny hammy performances from bryan cranston sam rockwell bryce dallas howard and cavill its lighthearted but somehow a little too long and not as sharp as vaughns previous work and certainly no bond movie but it is a pretty good big screen adventure throw in dua lipa john cena samuel l jackson and a few other surprises for good measure and some romance some action and a few laughs so basically its got a little something for everyone but probably not enough of one thing for most people thats it for this week join me next week and every week for another movie minute right here on 975 klak amfm magazine and recrd
Feb 12 2024,negative,argylle is bloated full of cliches and quickly becomes selfindulgent  while twists and turns come early and often highlighted by a strong first act the film ends up overly manic and outlandish to find any footing just a bit too convoluted
Feb 12 2024,positive,in 1020 years it will make sense but for now this overlong oddity is a flawed minor joy
Feb 10 2024,negative, elly conway bryce dallas howard holding her cat alfie chip has to dodge bad guys like those of her fictional spy character in the action comedy argylle photo courtesy of universal pictures apple original films and marv if youre familiar with director matthew vaughns work  in particular his spydriven action comedy kingsman and its lessinspired sequels  you know everything that argylle is or ever hopes to be loud fast sometimes audacious in its stylized violence but also a little exhausting the opening is a stunner introducing the supersuave spy argylle henry cavill on his latest mission he is infiltrating a den of villains to apprehend the villain lagrange dua lipa  but first some hot dancing and some gunplay then argylle and his techsavvy sidekick wyatt john cena capture lagrange and get a clue on information that will bring down argylles compromised agency and its director richard e grant elly calls her mom catherine ohara for her notes on her next installment in the argylle series and mom thinks elly needs one more chapter to finish the story elly decides to take the train she hates to fly to meet mom in chicago and its on the train that she meets aidan wilde sam rockwell a scraggly guy who says hes a big fan of ellys books aidan also tells elly that hes works in espionage  and to prove it he beats up the trainload of men trying to kill elly aidan fills elly in on a big secret her books are closer to reality than she knows the shadowy agency does exist and the director ritter bryan cranston has been compromised aidan needs ellys help to find a missing thumb drive that will help take down ritter  if aidan can get elly to overcome her squeamishness and get the drive to ritters nemesis the former cia director alfred solomon samuel l jackson  the biggest secret in jason fuchs script  the one the studio is begging critics and early moviegoers not to divulge  is the identity of the real spy on which argylle is modeled im not planning to give anything away though it doesnt take a lot of mental agility to figure it out the action sequences are expertly handled and loaded with almost comical levels of violence they feel after a few of them like a kingsman greatest hits reel if you liked colin firths dispatching of ruffians in that movie theres a sequence of rockwell doing something similar here if you liked the cartoonishly choreographed heads exploding there youll like the colorful ballet through tear gas here and so on the plot manages to be both convoluted and simplistic at the same time  with a lot of moving parts but all of them pointing in the same inevitable direction  the cast provides some pleasures along the way cavill is having fun as the debonair fictional spy and possibly auditioning for james bond while ohara makes the most of a surprising role and rockwell adds his own scruffy charms as aidan but the most delight in the uneven argylle is watching bryce dallas howard revel in the sort of actionpacked leading lady role shes never been given  and it turns out shes better at it than some of the male leads to whom shes had to play second fiddle
Feb 9 2024,negative, his career got off to a promising start with several action films including layer cake the kingsmen and kickass but it feels as if vaughn has been spinning his wheels as of late with the kingsmen turning into a somewhat profitable franchise for the filmmaker argylle arrives as essentially more of the same disguised as something original its an overstuffed action flick that really feels the weight of its massive 139 minute run time  hindered by a story that grows more uninteresting with every plot twist in argylle bryce dallas howard plays elly a reclusive writer who has just finished the fifth book in her popular series about a spy named argylle while on a train to visit her family elly is saved from an ambush by a reallife spy named aiden sam rockwell he then informs elly that her novel series has drawn the attention of a secret spy organization because her novels have mirrored actual events  even predicting the future at first elly is reluctant to believe aiden but as more and more people keep targeting her the more she realizes that she is really in danger  with aiden perhaps the only person capable of helping her find out who is targeting her argylle is a film that takes many twists and turns with some major developments that the studio has asked to keep a secret for the audience that creates a big problem when discussing the film because a lot of what doesnt work involves these secrets some of the plot twists only make it obvious that certain cast members are completely miscast while jason fuchs screenplay seems more intent on piling up those plot twists much of which are rather easy to see coming and pretty eyerolling instead of actually creating characters the audience can invest in the film features a loaded cast that includes henry cavill bryan cranston ariana debose and samuel l jackson but this cast is mostly wasted with only rockwell given much time to truly shine then there is vaughns direction which is more of that the same frenetically paced mayhem that has become a staple in his recent films these sequences that should be the highlights of the film quickly become repetitive with some creative decisions that only distract from the action argylle is one giant cinematic mess an action film that completely misfires from start to finish perhaps it is time vaughn tries something new a romantic comedy perhaps
Feb 9 2024,negative, no wait dont answer that of course im going crazy we all are but i mean specifically in the case of argylle this new action alleged comedy because i startled myself awake the morning after my screening the evening before with the shocking realization that nothing in the trailer  which has been ubiquitous and inescapable at cinemas for months now  is actually in the damn movie or is it maybe some of it is the movie itself had already faded from memory mere hours later its that blah though its frantic not to be taken as so but the trailer is alas more seared into my brain than the movie it wanted to sell me to the point that less than half a day later i wasnt quite able to separate the two its like how you cant be quite sure whether you genuinely remember something from your early childhood or if youre just recalling people talking about it because you know what whether my memory is accurate on a granular level doesnt matter many movie trailers include scenes that dont end up in the final film  trailers are often cut before production has even wrapped  but even then those trailers are usually broadly representative of what youll see in the cinema there is a new and worrying trend in which trailers for movie musicals hide the fact that theyre musicals but thats a rant for another day that argylle trailer though i dont think ive seen a more deceptive tease for a movie ever never fear argylle is not a musical argylle is absolutely not no matter how much the trailer insists a cheeky henry cavillkindasortaasjames bond chunk of delightfully winking spy nonsense cavill is barely in the film and when he is the film does him no favors also barely appearing john cena the suicide squad fighting with my family as his muscly sidekick which is downright criminal given cenas nowproven comedic chops pop star dua lipa as their slinkyladyvillain opponent is also barely in the film so any of her fans  and why cast her if not to draw in her fans  hoping for a more meaty performance after her brief screen debut in barbie will be disappointed also here for the paycheck bryan cranston isle of dogs the disaster artist catherine ohara when marnie was there frankenweenie ariana debose iss and samuel l jackson the hitmans wifes bodyguard star wars the rise of skywalker the latter fully embracing his phoningitinbecausehecan status what we get instead is a sadsack bryce dallas howard rocketman jurassic world fallen kingdom  honestly director matthew vaughn does not flatter any of his cast  as spynovel writer elly conway who gets caught up in supposedly reallife espionage shenanigans as a tagalong to sam rockwells aidan wilde a reallife spy stuff shes invented for her hugely bestselling books turns out to be actually real aidan informs her as he shanghais her into adventures n shit to the chagrin of the bad guys somebodys worried anyway its all a bit of a muddle even rockwells the bad guys trolls world tour trademarked impudence is smothered in between unconvincing cgi bullshit and frenetic fight scenes that seem to exist merely as a showcase for vaughns kingsman the golden circle xmen first class overstuffed manic style were asked to ponder whats real and what isnt elly keeps seeing in the midst of the frenzy flashes of cavills agent argylle but is there a real argylle and if so who could it be the marketing for the film implores us not to let the cat out of the bag once we know the secret theres a running joke about ellys pet cat which is along for the shenanigans in one of those appalling petcarrier backpacks that you should never ever put a cat in the movie leans hard into it and its the most cynical kind of distraction a desperate attempt to i dunno create internet memes perhaps without having the teensiest understanding of what makes cat content or anything else go viral online but the secret is simultaneously completely obvious and utterly ridiculous along multiple vectors talking about it once were beyond the worry over spoilers wont even be any fun just a tedious moppingup task the marketing for the film also wants to get us excited by how this is from the twisted mind of matthew vaughn spoiler there is nothing in the least bit twisted about argylle unless the word twisted is being deployed here as a strange catchall for crass confused and charmless in which case this may be the matthew vaughnest movie yet the inept script by jason fuchs wonder woman ice age continental drift makes zero distinction between the fictional spy malarkey of the adventures of cavills justice league mission impossible  fallout argylle and the real exploits that elly finds herself in the midst of surely good fun entertaining comedy perhaps even some bittersweet pathos could be mined from the contrast between overthetop cinematic depictions of spy stuff  the movie opens with a wannabebondian scene of cavills argylle in action before revealing to us that this is merely an excerpt from the book elly is writing  and the downtoearth reality of authentic unexciting spycraft that rockwells real spy would be muddling through its not just that vaughn stages every single thing that happens here with his usual goesto11 hyperactive vulgarity though he does its that a story about the difference between fiction and reality has decided that reality is just as monotonously cartoonish as ahem a blockbuster movie that is rumored to have cost 200 million to produce and yet somehow looks cheap as hell if ellys real life is as much cinematic balderdash as the fiction she invents what happens if we come up another level of the argylle inception yup vaughn fumbles the smug meta he brings into the realrealworld level too his movie is purportedly inspired by a novel by a writer called elly conway by book four in a series of spy thrillers although the first book has only just been published in conjunction with the films release as with trailers that feature scenes not in the movie the yearslong schedules of hollywood productions certainly can and do culminate in movies based on books that have not yet been published  movie rights are often shopped by publishing houses as soon as manuscripts are acquired which is typically 18 months or more before publication but it seems vanishingly unlikely that a book four from a completely unknown author would even be written at this point in the entire process never mind snagging such a sweet and lucrative deal is the author unknown though theres a conspiracy theory that taylor swift wrote the book theres another that the first version of the films script was written by jk rowling and that the plot was about jk rowling discovering that the wizarding world actually exists this seems to have grown out of the fact that the director stated a while back that he was inspired by that concept vaughn has been insisting that the book is the real deal but as with every single other aspect of this movie it doesnt matter even now that the identity of elly conway has been revealed and its as underwhelming as the secret of argylle there is nothing behind this vacuous multitentacled exercise in popculture marketing but flatulent hot air but as for the twisted mind stuff perhaps its like duncan jones describing moon as hard science fiction it really isnt there are all sorts of scientific errors and ways the company could do things differently that would break the plot and be cheaper for them but it doesnt have laser battles and spaceships that go whizz boom so by hollyword standards that makes it hard sf when mainstream film is doggedly straightforward and offers no surprises at all maybe a brief moment of confusion counts as twisted
Feb 9 2024,negative, director matthew vaughn is capable of some pretty incredible work kickass the first kingsman movie xmen first class and hes amassed a fun collection of regular actors who support his visions no matter how twisted or misguided they may be his latest work argylle is maybe his most ambitious film to date but size isnt everything in fact its the sheer excess of plot that ultimately crushes his tale of spies both real and imagined in this tale of author elly conway bryce dallas howard whose spy novels and their alarming accuracy get her into a heap of trouble  borrowing heavily from everything from romancing the stone to sandra bullocks the lost city argylle finds elly imagining a world of spies that look like henry cavill as the titular fictional character john cena as the trusted sidekick ariana debose as their person in the chair and even dua lipa as the latest books villain who is also a great dancer as shes on tour with her latest work elly lets it slip that her next book in the series is arriving sooner than her fans think in fact its basically done but her mother catherine ohara thinks the new books cliffhanger ending is a copout and demands she wrap things up more neatly by writing one more chapter it turns out that there are a lot of interested parties in the next chapter of her justfinished work because her stories tend to predict or mirror reallife events going on in the spy world a whole host of intelligence agents begins hunting her down to find out the location of a certain thumbdrive of information because where her agent argylle goes the real world apparently follows one of these spies supposedly on the side of good is aidan sam rockwell whose primary objective is protecting elly and her cat in a suitcase alfie that she cant go anywhere without and helping complete her novel so he can find out where this data is hidden there are a few decent action sequences here and there and rockwell is doing some of his finest sam rockwellstyle acting but for most of the film howard is a screeching dud who would rather yell at rockwell than do anything productive in order to save her own life to make matters worse director vaughn uses a visual gag that basically amounts to rockwell and cavill changing places every time elly blinks because she cant imagine that a schlub like aidan could possibly be the kind of spy she dreamed up in the character of argylle its visually jarring and takes us out of the moment every time he uses it which is in many of the early action sequences also turning up for a little supporting color are bryan cranston as the head of a global spy syndicate sofia boutella as a point of contact known as the keeper of secrets she doesnt get to fight so i barely cared she was in this and samuel l jackson as the former cia head and aidans boss there comes a certain point in the plot where i cant really talk about any of the twists and turns and there are thousands of them but after a while i stopped caring its all too much all in the service of doing little more than letting the film spin its wheels extending its running time this thing runs damn near two hours and 20 minutes and attempting to turn howard into an action star explain something to me why is this approach to the spy genre better than simply telling a skillful tale of espionage how does that extra layer of story make argylle a better movie the truth is it doesnt and a part of me thinks screenwriter jason fuchs knows that instead it makes it unnecessarily complex full of secrets that only seem to be secrets to elly which i think is done in service of the comedic elements of the movie very few of which are actually funny with the exception of a few likely improvised zingers from rockwell who is the only performer that got me through this movie at best the film is a showcase for rockwell at its worst argylle is an overblown action movie that gives us very little we havent seen before with the exception of the cat most of the time its aggressively mediocre  to cap it all off theres a midcredits scene that unexpectedly and pointlessly ties the movie to another franchise you wont have to bend

Feb 9 2024,neutral, you know theres a problem when the selling point of argylle is henry cavill and dua lipa when it should be the films major players bryce dallas howard and sam rockwell director matthew vaughn kingsman franchise kickass and writer jason fuchs i still see you deliver an overblown cgiladen spy film that makes the last few fast  furious movies seem like conceivable dramas that includes tej and roman driving a car in space the convoluted storyline gets better after the twist but boredom sets in despite the barrage of alist antics offkey musical interludes and that darn cat swifties love a good conspiracy theory fortunately this one doesnt pan out argylle is the story of author and cat lady elly conway bryce dallas howard whose novels are centered on dashing super spy argylle played by henry cavill who trades in the superman look for a vanilla ice haircut his latest antagonist is the exotic villain and femme fatal lagrange could have used some zz top on the soundtrack played by pop star dua lipa who is actually very good argylles team includes tech whiz wyatt john cena and field agent keira ariana debose who engage in a carmotorcycle chase through the narrow and winding streets of greece leading to some of the worst cgi effects since birdemic shock and terror her latest book in the series still unpublished needs an ending according to her mom ruth catherine ohara so elly jumps on a train with her cat alfie in a backpack and leaves colorado for a visit with the parental units in chicago fyi alfie is played by claudia schiffers cat chip the supermodel is married to director vaughn but its evident that chip is only in a handful of scenes after bad cgi rears its ugly head several times inserting a digital cat into most of the film in one scene alfie is being stroked by a character whose hands on occasion dont make contact with the feline cena usually brings the laughs but not here the comedy comes from sam rockwell as a real spy named aidan who rescues elly from a handful of assassins on the chicagobound train he tells elly that her novels are very close to actual events in the espionage world real spies consider her a fortune teller bryan cranston plays the villainous ritter who runs the division a spy organization out to get elly so they can read her next chapter which reportedly contains a file with the names of various secret spies sure its fiction but remember her novels shadow realworld events meaning a real file with possible real names the plot is convoluted and gets worse as imaginary characters and real ones collide the twist in the story helps make sense of all these shenanigans but then theres a whacky finale that resembles a music video with plumes of colorful smoke oil skating think ice skating minus ice with oil and music selections from the beatles patrick cowley with sylvester barry white and a new song by ariana debose boy george  nile rodgers argylle drags on for two hours and 19 minutes and in that time we get more stars including samuel l jackson as a wineloving excia director sofia boutella as a mysterious character from the past and richard e grant as a spy director character in ellys books all who are just passing the time and getting paid bryce dallas howard looks uninspired but at least sam rockwell is entertaining mailing address 2003 8th ave 300 fort worth tx 76110phone 8174059318email hellofortworthreportorgour missionwe pledge to produce highquality objective local journalism that informs public decisionmaking addresses the quality of life of our communitys citizens holds our policymakers accountable and tells our readers stories by listening to them and making sure they are valued and understood in all that we do earning the trust and respect of our audience is paramount our reporting will be free to all who access our primary digital channels
Feb 9 2024,negative,if i was taylor swift and i wrote argylle i too would deny the whole thing
Feb 9 2024,negative, a spy caper filtered through the lens of an authors existential crisis argylle is either too clever or not clever enough for its own good either way style overwhelms substance throughout the latest twisty saga from british director matthew vaughn the kingsman trilogy which struggles to generate consistent intrigue or suspense as a satire it indulges in many of the same genre tropes it seeks to subvert the opening sequence sets an appropriate visually extravagant tone as debonair agent argylle henry cavill flirts with an alluring woman dua lipa to barry whites youre the first the last my everything before the two wind up on opposite sides of a perilous chase through urban greece soon after we learn that their showdown never happened at all but was rather invented by elly bryce dallas howard a reclusive writer on the verge of completing her latest globetrotting espionage novel yet her mother catherine ohara argues the ending is incomplete perhaps its because elly is almost impossibly timid and averse to adventure  shes never even been on a plane  and she doesnt really know her subject so she hops a train home only to encounter the disheveled aidan sam rockwell who claims to be a spy himself with a connection to the characters in her books no less the convoluted screenplay by jason fuchs pan gradually reveals details of its multilayered mythology and the characters with varying motives and agendas entangled in a complex web of deception and betrayal shifting loyalties and mistaken identities we meet other enigmatic figures including argylles colleagues john cena and ariana debose a mysterious bureaucratic official bryan cranston and a philosophical excia officer samuel l jackson with various levels of involvement in a hightech conspiracy the film is most appealing while unspooling vaughns cheeky if ostentatious set pieces which are sharply choreographed and accompanied by the requisite cool retro soundtrack and exotic scenery meanwhile the eclectic ensemble cast does its best to inject emotional depth into a headscratching story thats more about secrets than sympathy and nobody is a clearcut hero or villain as reality and fantasy begin to blend together argylle doesnt provide sufficient incentive for moviegoers to care about which is which  or who prevails in the final chapter
Feb 9 2024,negative, theres a lot of tv out there we want to help every week well tell you the best and most urgent shows to stream so you can stay on top of the everexpanding heap of peak tv frankly if any movie is worth seeing on the big screen its the ufcthemed remake of an 80s cult hit from the director responsible for the bourne identity and edge of tomorrow ill project road house on the side of my apartment building if i have to but limans public dustup with amazon is also emblematic of the bigpicture anxieties around the future of cinemas in the streaming age to that end netflix is so adamant on prioritizing streaming that the companys head of film scott stuber is leaving after seven years at the helma decision influenced in part by coceo ted sarandoss refusal to give any of netflixs films a full theatrical release but in the past year one streamer has pulled a 180 and embraced the theatrical experience for now at least apple has emerged as an unlikely haven for auteurdriven blockbusters since launching in november 2019 apple tv has prioritized quality over quantity when it comes to its original programming the companys success rate is far from perfect but in essence apple is trying to build its reputation the same way hbo did that sentiment extends to the apple original films banner which made history in 2022 when the comingofage drama coda became the first movie distributed by a streamer to win best picture but if it feels like coda almost immediately vanished from the cultural conversation it might have something to do with the films nonexistent theatrical push in fact coda had such a limited run in cinemas that apple didnt disclose its box office numbers deadline estimates that the movie grossed as little as 500000 prior to its big oscar win  apples film strategy was meant to entice people to sign up for the streamer but the downside is that even a best picture winner will barely make a ripple in the zeitgeist without a meaningful presence in cinemas especially when all data points to apple tv having far fewer subscribers than its competitors did you know tom hanks wrote and starred in greyhound apples wellreceived dad blockbuster about a navy commander tasked with defending allied ships from german uboats exactly now apple is leaning in the opposite direction like amazon the company has pledged to spend 1 billion annually on movies that will be released in theaters and if you want to show people you mean business on the big screen theres no better statement of intent than footing the bill for martin scorseses latest masterpiece  in killers of the flower moon based on david granns nonfiction book of the same name scorsese covers a harrowing period in american history known as the reign of terror during which members of the osage nation were systematically killed by perpetrators seeking to inherit their wealth its the kind of movie you rarely see from a major studio these days least of all when it comes with an eyepopping budget of 200 million killers of the flower moon was originally set up at paramount but soaring production costs led apple to finance the project while killers of the flower moon ended up grossing just north of 155 million apple has a different metric for success that isnt reliant on box office receipts and for what its worth earning more than 155 million is no small feat for a film covering such grim subject matter over a 206minute running time killers of the flower moon has since been nominated for 10 oscars including best picture while demonstrating how apple can fill the void for filmmakers who may struggle to get certain kinds of movies made in the current studio landscape  in that spirit apples next major theatrical release was napoleon ridley scotts historical epic about the infamous french emperor as played by joaquin phoenix while the critical reception to napoleon was more mixed the film ended up crossing the 200 million threshold at the box office an impressive achievement in and of itself the movie also scored three oscar nominations with the release of napoleon apple added to its burgeoning reputation as an auteurfriendly streamer that treats theatrical distribution as an essential part of its strategy which leads us to apples third blockbuster heading to cinemas argylle  at the same time its important to remember that apple isnt doing all of this out of the goodness of its heart the company is in the business of promoting a streaming service and ensuring blockbusters get a proper run in cinemas is a great way to attract top talent theres no guarantee that apple will stick to this strategy in the long run or that the company wont butt heads with creatives the way amazon has but in the meantime apple has transformed into a viable alternative to hollywoods major studiosand is taking a bite out of its competition rachel and callie discuss the bravo news of the week and dive into some recent episodes then jodi hops on to talk the valley and vanderpump rules

Feb 8 2024,negative, synopsis a reclusive author who writes espionage novels about a secret agent and a global spy syndicate realizes the plot of the new book shes writing starts to mirror realworld events in real time i imagine that during the studio pitch director matthew vaughn and scribe jason fuchs sold argylle as a fun spy adventure with twists at every turn im almost certain that the words spectacular stunning and remarkable were never uttered and were intentionally left out because there is simply nothing surprising about any of the curveballs it tries to throw at the audience any spy cliche or trope you can think of argylle has it in spades the result is a jampacked film overstuffed with so much utter nonsense that you could call it an attack on the senses with diphenhydramine and thats a shame because anyone who loves a good spy novel or movie should love argylle you have a great cast where bryce dallas howard plays a socially reclusive author elly conway who spends too much time with her cat argylle and not enough trying to find someone to share her life with thats her mother the irreplaceable catherine ohara talking who also adds the fifth book in the agent argylle series which doesnt have an ending that will appease her fans however her novels have hit too close to home at least thats what a stranger on a train named aiden sam rockwell tells her before defending her against a couple of dozen armed assassins confusingly howards elly keeps trying to run away from aiden the one man not trying to kill her but we will get into that later aiden helps her escape and then tells her about a secret rogue organization called the division led by director ritter bryan cranston who wants to abduct elly and not her cat to find out how she unwittingly knows so much about their dirty deeds that she puts to paper the film slogs along at 134 minutes to put that in perspective thats on par with the last three of the fast  furious franchise and some of the things that happen in argylle are just as ludicrous its hard to tell you just how much thats true with facts because we cannot ruin it with spoilers as much as i try to keep things cautious most of this involves laying parallel narratives with ellys previous four argylle novels the current one she is trying to write and the reallife mystery that places it all together frankly fuchss script thinks its smarter than it is much of the films plot relies on red herrings or implausible commonsense connections not to mention the endless montages of a onenote joke comparing henry cavills argylle to sam rockwells aiden when the film makes its big reveals its more of a cheap trick where if you look back significant character decisions feel like filler and vain attempts to move the story forward vaughn tries to distract most of this with big names handsome faces the charm of its leads and a cute cat and to his credit he nearly does rockwell brings the type of mixed lunacy and folksy charm that has made him a household name i could see the pairing of henry cavill and john cena in a reallife buddy action comedy i will admit the films best scene involving a ridiculously goofy song and dance ballet of bullets did put a wicked grin on my face its so out of place but so entertaining that i almost forgave everything that came before it  samuel l jacksons cameo is a headscratcher he plays a former head of the cia with a man cave filled with sports memorabilia a ticker for stocks and sports betting and a moviesized screen for espionage and lakers games personally i was hoping this was jacksons reallife office and he made the filmmakers bring the cameras to his doorstep in a power move built off his legendary hollywood swagger and gravitas and thats how distracted i was with the relentless onslaught of hollywood nothingness that argylle is or maybe thats just my crippling case of adhd even the final scene and midcredits scene are headscratching while i enjoyed the endless charm of rockwell youll be asking yourself who cares until the final credits roll
Feb 8 2024,negative, kget  director matthew vaughn created an engaging and fun film a decade ago with the spy tale kingsman the secret service he blended the quirks of an everyday bloke  played by taron egerton  with the cool sophistication of a classic spy story that original kingsman  from story to acting  worked to near perfection his latest spycivilian tale argylle is nearly perfectly awful from story to acting it is not smart enough to be intriguing and not enough of a spoof to be funny it falls into that deadly zone of being a film that should have opened in more than one thousand paper shredders rather than theaters elly conway bryce dallas howard is a successful writer of spy novels she enjoys staying at home to write and hang out with her cat alfie the hero of her stories is agent argylle  played in hunky fashion by henry cavill her latest book has argylle ready to expose an evil spy organization thats when conway learns that her books have so closely mirrored the real spy world that she is being tracked down to reveal what is to happen in chapters she has not written only the appearance of oddball aidan sam rockwell  who falls somewhere between inspector clouseau and james bond  saves her it also puts her on the run for her life with her cat riding in the carrier on her back argylle immediately has problems as it comes across as being too close to the 2022 sandra bullock film the lost city bullock played a romance novelist whose life is in danger when her research for her latest book gets the attention of a ruthless billionaire vaughns film varies from that path because of the jumbled script by jason fuchs wonder woman the story goes from the writers reality that drifts into fiction to a tale of fiction where the good and bad guys change sides more than a onesided tennis match theres reality fictionalized reality fictionalized fiction and then mass confusion the film drags on and on that comes as a surprise because the opening number with dua lipa cavill and john cena could be attached to the start of any james bond movie and gets the film off to a flying start when lipas brief time ends the film settles into the flailing attempts to be funny dramatic romantic political and intriguing there is no concern that time elements medical plot twists or even the entire basis of the story makes no sense fuchs does a masterful job of making it all so incoherent that it becomes a lump of writing failure magnifying all the writing problems is vaugns indecision as to how to tell the story all the advertising focuses on conways cat that at times is so poorly created through computer graphics a stick figure would have been more believable but the cat is nothing more than a story furball that is overly annoying the crowning moment of cinematic defeat comes in a massive shootout near the much welcomed ending two characters must fight their way down a hallway filled with at least 100 guards firing at them they use colorful smoke to shoot the guards and not get hit vaughns staging is so far into the realm of silliness that nothing could help it he drives ahead by turning the scene into something so goofy that it would have created cringing in a cheesy romantic comedy and the scene just cant find an ending much like the entire movie howard does her best but never sells any of the alternative versions of her from the novelist rockwell tries to pick up the energy but even an oscarwinner cant raise the dead argylle is supposed to be the spark to get the zombielike 2024 movie season going it is also a major gamble from the streaming service apple tv this masterful mess should not be counted on for any good news on either front to have a successful garden you need to know when it is the best time to plant here are the best plants to start in may

Feb 7 2024,negative, with kingsman the secret service and kickass english filmmaker matthew vaughn has twice shaken up stiff action subgenres with explosive energy and irreverence these movies not only delivered gonzo violence cascades of cursing and bawdy sex jokes but also launched sequels with the actioncomedy argylle vaughn seems to be at it again but this time hes surrendered the hardr rating thats long served him well instead presenting audiences with a pg13 spy tale that regrettably pulls its punches  its not just a matter of a high body count with virtually no blood a trick christopher nolans dark knight trilogy pulled as well its that without the rrating vaughn is constrained to do something tamer and for him that means making a movie for women where danger romance and hilarious hijinks  well not so much collide as bump into each other awkwardly see vaughn has no idea what women want turning in a tedious espionage adventure that is too much in all the wrong ways  the premise of argylle has echoes of the 1984 comedy romancing the stone in which kathleen turner stars as a romance novelist named joan who gets swept up in an adventure that seems ripped from her books pages see also the sandra bullock romp the lost city along the way joan fights and then falls in love with a rugged rogue named jack michael douglas argylle screenwriter jason fuchs contorts this setup slightly bryce dallas howard stars as elly conway a heralded author of spy novels who finds herself caught up in a web of intrigue along the way elly becomes entangled with a real spy named aiden sam rockwell who promises survival  and maybe romance  however the archetypes here have shifted elly is no sharptongued kathleen turner heroine and rockwell doesnt have the swagger of 80s douglas hes less rugged and more worldweary playing a spy who is less bond and more beach bum rockwell frequently looks like hes sleepwalking or desperately bored while howard is often reduced to wideeyed alarm and tiresome whining as an author plunged into a world shes only experienced behind her laptop the pair dont have any sexual chemistry so when the plot inevitably throws elly and aiden together into a sultry dance number something crucial is missing  as demanded of spy movies vaughns latest will take audiences around the globe to exotic and gorgeous locations wreaking carnage along the way but in the wake of truly gonzo action movies like the mission impossible and fast and furious franchises vaughns opening gambit of spy schtick  as seen in the trailer  feels a pale imitation even if it is bolstered by big stars like henry cavill dua lipa and john cena you see argylle not only shows us ellys actual adventure with scruffy spy aiden but also the imagined adventures of her titular fictional spy the debonair agent argylle played by the witcher star wearing the worst haircut weve seen him in yet  a strangely square buzz cut that looks like he pissed off his barber  it should be fun to watch the rumpled world of rockwells realworld spy intercut with ellys glossier argylle facing similar version of events as they unfold with cavill and rockwell enacting the very same stunts in their different styles but the bit gets old fast in part because the argylle character is woefully onenote hes all swagger oneliners and winks whereas rockwells aiden seems bored and beleaguered whether hes taking down assassins or delivering a tutorial about how to crush a human skull its a superficial though solid contrast but its impact dulls in repetition  as elly gets into the action theres promise for a new turn but frankly what should be argylles most bonkers bits feel woefully underwhelming blame the lack of chemistry between its leads blame the fact that vaughn rips off birds of prey from a colorful smokebombed raid to cheeky danceinspired action blame a soundtrack that favors 70s disco and slow love songs to score fight scenes seemingly aiming for guardians of the galaxy or kingsmen but actually undercutting their stakes and energy but most of all blame that vaughn has no concept of what women want in action heroines  the premise of an everywoman getting swept into espionage intrigue and romance is a trusted formula for thrilling female audiences however elly is less everywoman and more infantilized she freaks out at any spylevel action her only friend is her mom an underused catherine ohara and her only loves are her writing and her cat alfie mostly confined to ellys backpack the scottish fold fur baby is basically a disney princess sidekick cute and cuddly and  on rare occasions  relevant to the plot perhaps this is by design with the pg13 rating aiming to appeal to the many young women who contributed to making barbie a blockbuster but barbie was more than a dazzling fantasy and argylle isnt even dazzling  the fashion fantasy that barbie the lost city and even the tom cruise movies offer women is woefully missed here the fancy costumes in argylle feel cartoonish more than glamorous and in the real world when elly strives to live up to her fantasy on a mission the result is an evening dress that fits like a dream but with a color that feels juvenile along with an inexplicable haircut she seems uncomfortable in it as if shes in costume rather than living her dream so when she begins pulling off big action moves its missing the thrill of harley quinn cutting loose in cool clothes that are made to move  and kick ass  in  the only time argylle comes close to working is when it embraces the absurdities of spies dancing specifically the whirly bird is superb here one dancer hoists his partner into the air her legs outstretched over his shoulders her crotch at his face and they spin gracefully defying physics and slyly simulating cunnilingus this is as close as argylle gets to a sex joke and its also the closest it gets to realizing its own potential to be silly and sexy elsewhere dance is bonded to violence but it doesnt stick the landing the way this running gag does  argylle is not fun enough to pull this off instead it offers romance ruined by a lack of sex appeal jokes that hit as hard as an infant might and action doubly undermined by bewildering music choices and pulled punches  possibly because of the restraints of pg13 notably the killer doll slasher m3gan managed to be jawdroppingly violent with such a rating and worst of all it is unforgivably long belabored by plot twists  many of these turns and doublecrosses are telegraphed so intensely that it feels wrong to call them a twist others involve barely established characters and so carry all the emotional weight of a wiffle ball still others seem to exist to just drag out the third act for another action sequence the actual runtime of this movie is two hours and 19 minutes but midway through i began to wonder how long id been in the theater waiting  pining  to laugh or feel a thrill had it been three hours four a thousand  vaughns other crime is in casting on paper this supporting lineup is stellar in addition to the aforementioned cavill cena lipa and ohara the cast includes ariana debose bryan cranston rob delaney and samuel l jackson but in execution its a disaster fuchss script gives cranston criminally cliched bad guy speeches which the breaking bad star growls through with nowhere to go ohara is wasted in a role without punchlines as is delaney and the rest of the cast from lipas glitzy lagrange to cenas tough guy wyatt are handed onenote characters who offer little more than the opportunity to cameo  while there are some fun bits in argylle the whole is far less than the sum of its parts so in the end much like the flash this action movie feels less fun and more like a punishment kristy

Feb 7 2024,negative,  orion and the dark is an animated kids movie penned by charlie kaufman who is known for writing offbeat dramas like being john malkovich and adaptation based on the book of the same name by emma yarlett kaufmans script follows a boy named orion jacob tremblay who is afraid of everything the night before a school field trip orion meets his biggest fear the dark paul walter hauser who joins him on a journey that forces orion to face and learn from his fears while orion and the dark is kiddie fare kaufman does manage to squeeze in some jokes aimed at adults children likely wont understand the nods to david foster wallace and werner herzog while director sean charmatz brings kaufmans script to life in colorful ways including when orions drawings of his fears come flying off the pages of his sketchbook some of the characters facial animations look dated but charmatzs stylistic choices are enjoyable overall orion and the dark is no inside out or soul but its still an entertaining exploration of orions vivid inner life tvy7 daniel rester netflix  in japanese director hirokazu koreedas 2018 masterpiece shoplifters a father tells his son all men like boobs its a cringey declaration but hardly evidence of bigotry the father a scrappy shoplifter doesnt hate gay people he just isnt worldly enough to consider that his son might be one in retrospect the moment plays like a prelude to monster in which koreeda crafts an exquisite portrait of queer love that gradually comes into focus a timeshifting tale of anguished parents desperate teachers and

the film is outright spectacular but director matthew vaughn kingsman xmen first class and screenwriter jason fuchs seem incapable of picking just one tone tangent or trajectory to follow the film starts as romancing the stone meets the bourne identity as mildmannered spyfi novelist elly conway bryce dallas howard becomes the target of actual secret agents when her latest manuscript reads too much like an active blackops case theres fun to be had with the contrast between ellys cleancut protagonist agent argylle henry cavill and the uncouth spy who protects her aidan wilde sam rockwell but a midpoint twist upends the whole excursion and sends elly on a divergent emotional journey that easily could have taken up the whole runtime vaughn cant decide if hes making another twisted james bond spoof like kingsman or a sincere ode to bombastic 80s thrillers but he remains unimpeachable as an action director delivering fight scenes that range from the creative to the ludicrous all while howard and rockwell share fabulous romcom rapport argylle strains under the weight of its ambitions but if vaughns irreverent charm is your thing itll leave you shaken and stirred pg13 morgan

Feb 7 2024,negative, matthew vaughn is back with wouldbe action franchise starter argylle all the ingredients for a fun time are here but its far too long and convoluted for its own good writes travis johnson inside director matthew vaughns argylle theres a fun brisk romantic action comedy screaming to get out you might have to listen carefully though theres a lot of bloat in the way some of that is down to the bête noire of modern filmmaking which is franchisefirst thinkingargylle is supposed to set up a sprawling espionage shared universe that encompasses itself vaughns kingsman series and a third secret thing but in trying to tip the first domino in the line vaughn and screenwriter jason fuchs pan succumb to selfindulgence argylle has moments scenes little bits of business that really pop but theyre mired in a plodding script that often comes across as smug rather than sly all other considerations aside the 139minute running time is a big asksome emergency surgery to get this thing down to a tight 100 would work wonders which is a shame because all the ingredients for a fun time are here a riff on romancing the stone which already serviced as inspo for the recent the lost city argylle sees a dowdieddown bryce dallas howard as elly conway spy thriller novelist and doting furmama to her cat alfie her hit series follows the exploits of superspy argylle henry cavill and making a welcome return to the screen schwarzeneggers haircut from commando essentially a james bond dropped into a mission impossible story in real life however shes anxious lonely and under the thumb of her cheerfully domineering mother catherine ohara who can do this stock role in her sleep things change however when she encounters a real spy sam rockwells aiden on an interstate train trip and hes nowhere near as suave as ol argylle hes a dab hand at fighting off the wave of assassins that show up though and so elly is now on a jetsetting jaunt with the affable aiden with alfie along for the ride why her good question shame about the answer far too convoluted for its own good argylle lurches from set piece to set piece and while the action is generally very good and the chemistry between our two leads is palpable its hard to really care about whats going on the mi films have taught us that plot can be largely irrelevant but stakes still matterethan hunt is out to save the world argylle is low stakes but lacks the dexterity to still be engaging you can see rockwell struggling to elevate the material hes been given to work with while howard is stuck with a deerintheheadlights expression for most of her screen time until later developments which we wont spoil see her thrust directly into the action theres a lot going on in argylle but perhaps too much a good actioner should leave us breathless not exhausted theres fun to be had sure the supporting cast including bryan cranston as ellys dad and john cena dua lipa and richard e grant as various characters in the fictional argylle universe plus samuel l jackson and sofia boutella briefly cropping up in the real world are pretty great but sparsely used theres a scattering of genuinely surprising and impressive action gagsvaughn loves and respects action choreography and thats readily apparent here but at the end of the day argylle feels like an overly long example of the sort of big budget but instantly forgettable action fodder that netflix cranks out on the reg and not the foundation of a new and exciting cinematic universe it barely functions as a standalone movie it should be noted that this is an apple tv production and your best course of action might be to check it out when it eventually drops there

Feb 7 2024,negative, one of the big stories from the world of cinema is the disastrous opening for argylle the spy comedy from the director of the kingsman films and xmen first class despite an allstar cast mega budget and huge advertising push the film has flopped at the box office and is predicted by many to sustain a ninefigure loss  not even the entirely false suggestion that the spy novel its based upon was written by taylor swift was enough to convince people to visit cinemas so is it as bad as the numbers suggest bryce dallas howard grins and bears it as elly conway the author of a popular series of spy novels featuring the suave protagonist agent argylle henry cavill fact and fiction intersect when elly is attacked on a train and rescued by a real spy sam rockwell who reveals that her books are actually predicting real life incidents making her the target of an evil terrorist organisation  following a similar pattern to kingman outsider enters a secretive spy world the film sadly becomes more tedious as the time rolls on the viewer is beaten into submission with pointless twists that over complicate the story and make the mission feel like a chore the high production values are undermined by elements that dont particularly work such as cavill appearing in ellys subconscious or numerous gags involving her cat nothing comes together in a satisfying way and at around two hours twenty minutes those weaknesses add up  rockwell and howard are fun as the odd couple outrunning bullets while bryan cranston is over the top as the villain ritter the characters who exist in ellys books are great to watch but it feels like a waste of big stars such as cavill and john cena given they only appear sporadically the highly publicised appearance of a certain pop star not that one is even more confusing given its barely more than a glamorous cameo  there are worse films than argylle but few that were more costly to produce the proposed beginning of a trilogy its difficult to see what would make the few people who have seen this in cinemas come back for more in the world of action theres no bigger crime than being dull
Feb 7 2024,negative, argylle with bryce dallas howard sam rockwell henry cavill bryan cranston samuel l jackson written by jason fuchs directed by matthew vaughn rated pg13 for strong violence and action and some strong language 139 minutes in theaters a 200 million budget and they couldnt spring for an actual cat as most readers have probably ascertained from the maddeningly ubiquitous marketing campaign matthew vaughns enervating espionage romp argylle costars a fuzzy grey feline named alfie who spends the film primarily consigned to a backpack worn by bryce dallas howard the carrier has a little plastic porthole so the filmmakers can keep cutting to cat reaction shots that arent nearly as cute as the movie seems to think they are it should go without saying that no animals were harmed in the making of the movie as i dont think any animals were photographed alfie is a janky cgi creation out of cheapo kids films like garfield a tale of two kitties and a fitting mascot for a movie in which everything appears disconcertingly artificial filmed in 2021 argylle is the most covidlooking of covid era movies there are seldom more than two performers in any given scene usually standing in front of cavernously empty backgrounds that all seem to share the same eerily still plasticky sheen the volume screen production model might be a technical miracle yet it remains incapable of convincingly depicting people being outside this uncanny valley effect works strangely in the movies favor during the opening sequence which cheekily parodies the popular spy novels penned by the protagonist with henry cavill and dua lipa spouting selfconsciously cliched lines like you and i are not so different before taking part in absurd stunts that defy all known laws of physics cavills agent argylle is the signature creation of howards shy selfeffacing cat lady elly conway a former figure skater who started a second career as a spy novelist after suffering a nasty bump on the head the thing about ellys books is that theyre full of top secret shenanigans that keep actually happening which has got not just the cia but also assorted other shady characters extremely interested in what shes cooked up for the next installment weirdly her novels are numbered like movie sequels ie argylle 5 which bears no resemblance to how actual books are published imagine sitting down to read jack reacher 42 or james bond 316 shes rescuedslashabducted by an irritable operative played by sam rockwell in a performance that initially makes no sense whatsoever in an action scene that feels like a knockoff of the already bad movie bullet train except twice as long the first hour or so of argylle is dreadful building to a shocking reveal that should already be obvious to anyone whos seen a movie before especially anyone whos seen a certain 90s action movie scripted by shane black right down to the ice skates but since the ads implore us not to let the cat out of the bag ill play along and avoid specifics safe to say that the film improves considerably after the midmovie revelation of the real agent argylle with rockwell allowed to evince an endearing lovesick charm once hes no longer burdened with having to con the audience he and howard come to have such terrific chemistry you resent the reels wasted on their bickering most of the movies problems could have been solved by tossing the extraneous trickery and moving the twist  which is where the story actually starts  to the front this also would have gotten me home before midnight argylle gets better the more it embraces the cartoonishness of its premise as the pervasive unreality of the films visual design lends itself to the outlandish action scenes that are director vaughns forte the extreme laddishness and rude boy excesses of his kickass and kingsman pictures have been toned down to pg13 levels but vaughn still racks up quite the body count during a wild skating extravaganza rockwell remains one of the best dancers in movies  the joy he takes in movement is infectious  and lord knows the lousy movie musicals weve been seeing lately could use someone like him but i guess well have to settle for a balletically lethal display of his dance prowess the moment in this movie when i finally surrendered and started smiling too bad it doesnt arrive until the third act in a choice that can only be described as bizarre the love theme to argylle is now and then the aiassisted zombie beatles cashgrab single released in november 2023 that made everybody kind of uncomfortable for a few minutes before we all went back to listening to abbey road two characters in the film who havent seen each other for five years talk about how they used to dance to the tune way back when they were stationed in mogadishu which is a weird thing to say about a song that didnt exist yet when the scene was shot the melody  what little there is of it  has been incorporated into lorne balfes score throughout the film  over the past two decades sean burns reviews interviews and essays have appeared in wburs the artery philadelphia weekly the improper bostonian metro the village voice nashville scene and rogerebertcom he stashes them all at spliced personality

Feb 6 2024,negative,argylle takes all the spyespionage tropes and supercharges it for this movie its predictable but fun  up to the third act where certain gags and scenes took longer than necessary and lost steam sam rockwell is the one to watch in this 
Feb 6 2024,negative, in 2006 will ferrell gave a bravura performance his best in stranger than fiction playing an unwitting unwilling character in a novel being written by another person here director matthew vaughn takes a thenunpublished manuscript by elly conway apparently changes it substantially turning it into a vague comedic imitation of ferrells movie bryce dallas howard plays conway a publicity shy author of a series of successful espionage books who suddenly becomes involved in real life events mirroring her novels unfortunately unlike ferrells fiction vaughns movie written by jason fuchs is convoluted and absurd its like slapstick or probably unintended satire conway gets involved in fights between protagonists aidin sam rockwell and others who are out to do no good and to kill her to her puzzlement the fights are confusing and even more bizarre than most of the silly fights in todays hollywood as the combatants interchange between conways fictional hero argylle henry cavill to aidin in the blink of an eye back and forth its enough to make one dizzy after they ask whaaaat if you hang around to the end of this far too long movie which i dont advise the convolution is explained but not before more fights and a final segue onto a mega tanker ship that is so clumsy it boggles and befuddles the mind howard is woefully miscast as a martial arts heroine as her zaftig physique 57 139 makes her fighting scenes unintentionally laughable the supporting cast is impressive for such a disappointing movie including bryan cranston catherine ohara john cena and the always entertaining samuel l jackson in a cameo tony medley is a columnist and mpaaaccredited film critic his reviews are published in the larchmont chronicle telicom magazine the tolucan times cwebcom robinhoodnewscom on rottentomatoescom the movie review query engine and at  tony medley holds the rank of silver life master is an american contract bridge league club director and has won regional and sectional titles an attorney he received his bs from ucla where he was sports editor of uclas daily bruin and his jd from the university of virginia school of law cwebcom is an american multinational media news company cweb digital provides worldwide news content cweb reports breaking news celebrity entertainment sports politics finance stock market and business news 
Feb 6 2024,positive,this is the most fun a matthew vaughn film has been for a very long time 
Feb 6 2024,negative, from the jump director matthew vaughns kingsman kickass argylle explodes into a fizzbang ball of inanity but as juvenile humor and groanworthy puns coat every spitshined surface and plot points reach for spy tropes over and over againnot for the sake of spoofing but as devices laying around for vaughn and writer jason fuchs to pluck and rehashthe movie feels lazily written almost incidental a downloading bar stuck at 94 check a speedboat getaway check main leads trapped on a rooftop memory loss and mind control check check and check this isnt satire folks its just painfully predictable with a meandering plot that feels about as intentional as a series of improv sketches argylle whirls with empty theatrics a campy handheld camera that dizzyingly moves around is supposed to make up for blocky uninteresting fight choreographya surprising disappointment given the exciting action vaughns become known for nor can argylle boast visual splendor fakelooking backdrops seem to place actors into a permanent green room while obvious 3d renderings of cars explosions and sometimes people add to the sense of watching a cheap live action cartoon finally a toolong runtime woefully sags in the middle eliciting drooping eyelids and midmovie yawns without anything to sink your teeth into theres just not a great reason to watch argylle at home much less in theaters although the film does have a female lead spy novelist elly conway bryce dallas howard elly spends most of the film utterly powerlesswhimpering scared and anxious passing out multiple times  she does eventually scrabble together a bit of agency but for the most part shes a hollow vessel who listens wideeyed to the people around her in particular love interest aidan sam rockwell drags elly into his chaotic life of espionage teaching her to become the best version of herself cue groan furthermore hollywood consistently pairs significantly older men with younger women and argylle falls into that cliche with howard 42 13 years younger than rockwell 55 at the time of the films release neither does elly have any real connections with other women her mother played by scenestealer catherine ohara is at first supportive of her daughter but later reveals herself to be unreliable in minor roles sofia boutella reprises her usual slinky talldarkandsexy persona see kingsman the secret service the mummy playing an underworld mercenary who trades intel for power and in the films most depressing role for a woman dua lipas forced to lean into the demeaning bond girl trope to be fair the campy character is intentionally ridiculous crafted as an empty assemblage of comehither stares and innuendolaced lines but theres nothing empowering or even funny about watching a hypersexualized woman ramped up to a hundred it just feels gross the film cedes its screentime to almost entirely white actors such as howard rockwell henry cavill as ellys fictional hero argylle ohara and bryan cranston as a bland villain in minor roles samuel l jackson plays a seldomseen cia director reminiscent of so many other tokenized black characters in supposed positions of power who defer to white protagonists to save the day french algerian actor boutella appears in the generically labeled arabian peninsula scenesa contrast to other regions labeled by their country greece or city london ariana debose gets positive but scant scenes as a techsavvy spy and londonborn albanian singer dua lipa has the aforementioned lackluster role as a sexpot caricature the racial diversity is present just not in any meaningful way the only area of inclusion where argylle succeeds is with the centering of a female action hero elly who doesnt fit the cookiecutter mold of being thin as a rail see atomic blondes charlize theron red sparrows jennifer lawrence jennifer garner in tv series aliasthe list goes on the movie does undercut its own positive casting by having every other nameless guntoting female spy fall into this exact body shape but the slightly bigger elly gets by far the most screen time its refreshing to watch as elly confidently runs jumps andmemorablyspins around on deadly makeshift ice skates and its even more empowering to know that prior to the movies production howard advocated for herself she says to time i straight up said to matthew vaughn i just want you to know that this is my body and if you want my body to be smaller i think you should hire someone else its dispiriting that someone as beautiful and thin as howard even needs to have that conversation but nonetheless vaughn made the right decisionhowards casting is one of the films few bright spots even if argylle does have a female lead who has a slightly bigger body than the usual female action hero it fails in almost every other area of inclusiveness and well general merit with writing and direction you could easily mistake for a 10yearold boys fever dream the film hypersexualizes most of its female spies and barely remembers to include characters of color all of them tokenized sure plenty of people may well enjoy this lighthearted dontyoudaretakemeseriously fare but it couldve been silly and inclusive without much effort at all
Feb 6 2024,positive,the adept actors add gusto as they hang on to the wildly gyrating plot so even if its not particularly inventive theres fun to be had along the way

Feb 6 2024,negative, when argylle first released its trailer internet sleuths went into overdrive with suspicions that taylor swift was despite her impossibly busy schedule somehow involved in the project elly conway the author of the book upon which the film is based has no media presence and no photo online anywhere she has given no interviews and generally appears to be a burner persona the trailer revealed other small details like the leads scottish fold the same breed of cat owned by swift and the argyle pattern itself shes used before that drew many swifties to the belief that tay tay was actually elly conway if you want to read more about it heres one article covering the speculation i have seen the film and no there does not appear to be any relation between the film and taylor swift apart from those few random signifiers hate to break it to you swifties but the multihyphenate billionaire hasnt had the time to write and produce a spyactioncomedy in the middle of her world tour and headlinemaking romance lucky for her she dodged a bullet because argylle despite a few good twists is not nearly as clever or fun as it tries so hard to project itself to be bryce dallas howard stars as elly conway a hermit spy novelist thrown into a whirlwind of espionage she rarely vacates the writing desk in her remote cabin but she and her cat alfie a semicgi abomination that mews from the window of her cat pack are in for an epic adventure her successful series of books featuring a dashing clever spy named argylle henry cavill has the eery tendency to portray the real outcomes of actual missions by top secret intelligence agencies as such elly is a wanted woman so she heads to the train to visit her mother catherine ohara in an attempt to rid herself of writers block when she meets aidan sam rockwell who quickly proves to be the only thing keeping her alive aidan acts as her bodyguard whose mission is to keep elly out of the hands of a malevolent crime syndicate overseen by the fearsome bryan cranston i read recently that cranston has spoken publicly about using steve carells gru from the despicable me series as inspiration for this character if nothing tells you that argylle is grotesquely overthetop it is certainly its lead villain modeling his performance after an animated antagonist from a childrens film series this cloakanddagger agency known simply as the division does not have a clearcut mission except to be generally evil and malicious maligned against everything good and right both parties  the division and aidans undisclosed affiliation  are vying for the same thumb drive that contains the identity of every member in the division with the extra help of samuel l jackson elly unwittingly follows the imaginary breadcrumbs that result in the elusive files as well as the truth about her past  at least 30 minutes too long argylle was hit by a few bullets itself and the various holes in its plot were often too frustrating to avoid traveling from colorado to london to france the film moves fast in theory in reality most scenes creep along by far the films greatest adversary is its uneven tone and the confusion of its bottom line if the film is trying to be a satire on the spy thriller it isnt silly enough to make its point if its an earnest attempt to create a film that stands up to the many other wellloved action flicks in that category it isnt taking itself serious enough to cement its intent with audiences howards general likability as an actress is unparalleled but her glaringly absent screen chemistry with rockwell tips the ship enough that with time 139 minutes to be exact full submersion is inevitable if you enjoyed the previous films by director matthew vaughn known for xman first class and the kingsman series then there is likely something for you here he has a very particular look that prefers stylized action sequences lots of camera movements interesting camera angles and a propensity for cgi his brand of british action learned from previous collaborator guy ritchie is thrilling with an unrivaled sense of humor  there are pockets of that fun in argylle but pockets do not make a shirt except for the one big twist that you may not see coming the others youll likely spot through a moving train there are some nifty action sequences but by the films end the camp is nearly intolerable the story becomes lost to its ludicrous mission and the completely preposterous requirements for the characters to succeed one such example is elly figure skating around her foes with the mock skates she made by sticking knives in her shoes instead of ice there is a highly flammable layer of liquid crude oil that somehow acts as the perfect alternative to frozen water she skates around her enemies taking them out one by one in the end gunfire erupts anyway without any explosive reaction by the incendiary substance covering the scene which makes the audience wonder what was the point of that again this isnt to say the film isnt for someone it has a handful of great scenes and a novel twist if anything we can all agree the marketing campaign was topnotch would i sit through argylle again no the older couple next to me didnt even make it halfway through the runtime before vacating their seats but maybe its just not our cup of poison
Feb 6 2024,neutral, english director matthew vaughn is best known for making high concept high octane action movies like kickass and the kingsman series his new pg13 rated spy spoof argylle now playing in theatres features his trademarked busy stylistic action but feels like a toneddownie less violent and less provocativeversion of his previous work the chaotic story begins with bryce dallas howard as bestselling but reclusive author elly conway her life is as sedate as the spy novels she writes are exciting by day she sends her main character globetrotting superspy argylle henry cavill and sidekicks wyatt john cena and kiera ariana debose off on adventures to do battle with femme fatale lagrange dua lipa in hopes of taking down a global spy syndicate called the directorate after work  she spends quiet time at home with a hot date her beloved cat alfie best spy movie cat since blofelds solomon by her side turns out there is a real agent argylle some very bad people who are after her and ritter bryan cranston an unhinged spy master who thinks her books are too close to reality for comfort drawn into realworld espionage she aiden and the cat are thrust into a world wilder and certainly more dangerous than anything in any of her books a mixandmatch of mission impossible the james bond franchise and buddy comedies argylle is a jumbled confusing bit of semifun cartoonish and convoluted the movie is stuffed with overthetop spy action a stacked alisty cast and a wisecracking scenestealing performance from rockwell but never quite comes together loose ends strangle the storys forward motion vaughn occasionally falls into the movies deep plot holes and there are so many twists not even chubby checker could keep up it isnt until the films last half hour of an overlong 139minute running time that vaughn stages two eyepopping action sequences a deadly dance number and an untraditional figure skating routine are fun and have the kind of overthetop energy you expect from vaughn both sequences entertain the eye but also highlight what the rest of the movie so desperately lacks rockwells livewire performance provides most of the films laughs but they are few and far between as for the rest of the cast most are underused and you have to wonder why some of themincluding samuel l jackson and richard e granteven bothered to show up argylle is errs on the side of pg13 it is an outrageous twistyturny idea trapped in a movie that is afraid to really cut loose richard crouse shares a toast with celebrity guests and entertainment pundits every week on ctvs exciting talk show pop lifesaturdays at 830 on ctv newschannel midnight on ctv
Feb 6 2024,negative, elly conway bryce dallas howard is the author of the successful argylle spy novel series while promoting her fourth novel elly gets writers block and is trying to figure out how to end her fifth  with her pet cat alfie in tow elly takes a train to the city where she intends to iron out the finale with her mother ruth catherine ohara on the train elly meets a devoted argylle fan named aidan sam rockwell who also claims to be an actual spy as aidan takes out the passengers on the entire train elly goes back and forth between reality and her imposing and muscular interpretation of agent argylle henry cavill now the stories elly has been writing are coming true as an organization known as the division led by director ritter bryan cranston is searching for the very same master file that agent argylle is tracking in ellys books directed by matthew vaughn kingsman kickass xmen days of future past and written by jason fuchs ice age continental drift wonder woman argylle somehow provides everything you love about matthew vaughn films while also long overstaying its welcome vaughn has described the film as an homage to 80s action films such as die hard and lethal weapon and thats understandable the chemistry between bryce dallas howard and sam rockwell is very lethal weaponesque and is on par with more recent films such as knight and day or mr and mrs smith howards ability to cry on command brings the anxious aspect of her character to life and rockwells palpable charisma is always entertaining but argylle falls apart from the first action sequence overloaded with awkward green screen effects and shoddy cgi alfie is noticeably added digitally for the majority of the film while this makes sense from a no animals were harmed in the making of this film perspective its still a floating cat head slapped onto a backpack for most of the film the film also goes back and forth between the story elly is writing and what is happening in real life these two universes eventually collide and start telling the same story but at first the argylle universe is anchored by only actors standing in front of a green screen to a certain extent this makes sense since elly is consistently changing her mind and were seeing her work it out in realtime unfortunately this is also horrendously ugly theres the kingsman sequence of everyones head exploding near the end of the film and it was enjoyable because the use of special effects matched the longevity of the sequence in other words it wasnt incredibly exaggerated or maybe it was but only for a short duration argylle is that kingsman exploding head sequence stretched out for 139 minutes the film drags exponentially especially in its second half the dialogue and storyline extend far beyond their means anyway ellys writing seems purposely bad at first almost like a stephanie meyer novel but you slowly realize thats how jason fuchs writes the dialogue seems to be written by mojo jojo from the powerpuff girls  repeatedly verbalizing the same point using similar but slightly different words that hammer a point home one that was well comprehended by the audience the first go around while the action is impressive enough at first it quickly becomes redundant until its just completely ridiculous the train sequence feels like a throwback to the freebird church sequence from the first kingsman film without seemingly being done in one take  its a fight sequence done to licensed music with some slowmotion injected at times this formula is repeated later on in the movie with more guns and explosions the films end has a multicolored gas dance sequence between bryce dallas howard and sam rockwell which somehow sees them shooting enemies and dodging bullets without missing a step or getting shot the gas also becomes heartshaped as the two leads get more intimate later howard slaps some knife blades to her boots and ice skates on crude oil for an absurd sequence that is as weak and wobbly as it sounds argylle teases alfie doing something the entire film you either expect the feline to attack with its catlike agility or whip out a gun from its primordial pouch and start blasting making matters even worse this film has to be the most effortless payday samuel l jackson has ever had he eats a grape watches basketball and sits in front of a giant monitor for the extent of his brief appearance argylle is an action thriller that willingly wallows in goofy cringey nonsense its writing is immature and its action is overloaded with sloppy cgi and outrageous concepts that are preposterously frustrating 
Feb 5 2024,negative, matthew vaughn definitely has a brand with the kingsman franchise and kick ass the british director mostly makes movies that thumb their nose at authority decency and restraint these are loud overthetop films with style and bravado they may not be everyones cup of tea especially with diminishing returns for the kingsman series but its tough to argue that theyre a weak brew so even with all of the twists in argylle the spy action movies biggest surprise may be how utterly bland it is it isnt just that vaughn has made his first pg13 film in over a decade though argylle does feel oddly defanged or declawed if you will given that a cat gets more screen time than most of the famous actors on the poster theres just a single use of the fword nonsexual of course rather than the gleefully foulmouthed dialogue in vaughns adaptations of mark millars comics argylles script from jason fuchs pan features so so many deaths but the violence is bloodless and boring it all feels like vaughn is pulling his punches as much as the characters on screen  yet argylles larger sin isnt its neutered content the kingsman films have a growing number of detractors with each release but they at least feel like they were made by a person that person was probably an asshole but at least they were an asshole with a point of view and a knack for worldbuilding or building out millars world on screen those movies were smug but full of verve in both dialogue and visuals and this is just  there for almost twoandahalf hours  but i digress there are other things to be mad about in this movie and in the world as a whole than just cavills ludicrous coif like now and then the new awful song by  the beatles that vaughn plays multiple times or the onslaught of jokes that are lucky to get a chuckle or wasting a host of talented actorsjohn cena samuel l jackson bryan cranston catherine ohara ariana debose sofia boutella rob delaneyin small roles or parts that dont showcase what they can do also the effects look like shit at first the subpar cgi feels like part of the conceit our first big action scene is set in ellys book and its easy to give the filmmakers the benefit of the doubt shes writing a cheesy spy novel maybe its supposed to look like this but as the film progresses and were in what is meant to pass for the real world that bears no resemblance to reality the effects are cheap and unconvincing yet the biggest issue is that argylles various elements have all been done better before even by vaughn himself the kingsman movies or at least the first one were more entertaining takes on the world of espionage the lost city and of course romancing the stone both did the story of a hapless writer caught up in a real adventure in a far more fun way this is theoretically an original story wild marketing schemes and conspiratorial nonsense aside but so little of it feels fresh  argylle does have its moments coasting on the charms of rockwell and howard and a few solid sequences gets it far more mileage than it probably deserves for all its problems this should be a worse movie but various elements buoy it from being an absolute drag rockwell is a wild card an ace up the films sleeve but he isnt enough to eke out a winning hand for argylle 
Feb 5 2024,negative, you probably shouldnt listen to me in general and you really shouldnt when it comes to movies consider the fact that im no expert im not a director i dont have a degree in film studies im just some guy whos done some screenwriting and is extremely into movies and bear in mind that this isnt an impromptu pity party im throwing on my behalf theres something more to it i used to think that some movies and some tiers of filmmakers were objectively good akira kurosawa is a genius and if you feel otherwise thats a you problem not a kurosawa problem but you and i both know thats wrong the three most subjective things in this world are food love and art to return to kurosawa for a second i adore seven samurai youre not into it thats cool  i mention all of this because its important you understand when im not in sync with an audience were going to talk about mathhew vaughns spycomedy argyll if you want to enjoy yourself and have a nice time at the movies id skip reading literally everything beyond the next two sentences just know that the odds are good youll have a good time with this one and youll leave with a nice endorphin rush we could all use a little of that these days still here were introduced towell not just a man more the platonic ideal of a man the kind of man that men want to be and that women want to be with when donald trump tells his deeply hilarious and one hundred percent full of shit sir stories about strong men crying in front of him this can only be the kind of man he meant i am of course talking about the worlds greatest spy argylle henry cavill  hes on a mission in one of those preposterously scenic greek towns his objective to infiltrate a shadowy rogue intelligence agency to do that hell have to extract information from enemy operative lagrange dua lipa argylle only has his tech guy wyatt john cena his zero point eight percent body fat and his precisiontrimmed flattop to rely on theres also the fact that argylle isnt real hes the subject of a series of spy novels created by elly conway bryce dallas howard it helps that elly is a damn good writer she meticulously researches intelligence agencies languages regions all in an attempt to create verisimilitude elly wants to get it right with or without the help of her annoying mother ruth catherine ohara and with the help of her cuteasabutton scottish fold cat alfie what doesnt help is that elly might bewell too good a writer shes close to finishing her fifth book at her picturesque colorado home and while on a train trip to meet with ruth she meets aidan sam rockwell instead turns out the grungy aiden is a real spy and it turns out that ellys books have an alarming ability to predict the future the bad guys yes thats what aiden calls them want elly dead or alive so elly aiden and an extremely uncomfortablelooking alfie embark on a globetrotting adventure that all sounds like fun right it is and heres the thing about that director matthew vaughn has a welldeserved reputation for making ahem kickass action movies his creative blend of choreography color usage editing and cinematography has created numerous memorable action sequences hes shown us magneto slaughtering south american nazis a blue collar londoner thrown into a bondian world and a tween rampaging through a group of luckless mobsters theres a reason vaughn is one of the best in the business with argylle vaughn has made a sunnier though sloppier version of kingsman its not as edgelordadjacent as kickass and in fact his tone is breezy and light so light that everything feels somewhat inconsequential but well get to that whats frustrating to me is that as cleverly shot and staged as the action sequences are the pacing constantly drags things down  this being a matthew vaughn joining theres no surprise that the action sequences are clever such as a danceshootout with multicolored clouds of smoke and an ice skating sequence without ice i enjoyed the moments where we see elly watching aiden dispatch legions of goons and her perspective keeps shifting between seeing aiden and seeing argylle heavy handed and obvious yes entertaining sure sort of unfortunately the film drags quite a bit particularly in the first half theres no reason on gods green earth for a spy comedy to be close to two and a half hours long a film like this should move like a souped up aston martin too often argylle moves like roger moore in a view to a kill the screenplay by jason fuchs telegraphs a twist then another then another its not bad writing at all but fuchs seems more interested in yanking the rug out from under the audience than he is at telling a strong story sixty percent less twists would have been good in this case theres also the problem of repetition where over and over elly and aiden have to do a thing elly doesnt want to do the thing aiden attempts to persuade her then he forces her to do the thing its frustrating because when fuchs occasionally digs into the characters or the ridiculousness of the world that elly has been flung into its fun another couple of drafts spent tightening up the story  going for more interesting approaches would have been an improvement  the last ten thousand words i wrote though none of it really matters because as i walked out of the screening i overheard a group of women talking to a publicist about argylle they loved it adored it and were singing the films praises argylle is too long sort of dumb and less clever than it is clever if you treat it as a fleeting friday night trifle and if you definitely ignore me on this one youll be happier perhaps the most unbelievable detail is that colorado could actually have a statewide rail system thats clean and inexpensive who do you people think we are europe
Feb 5 2024,negative, theres style over substance and then theres argylle a film that makes michael bay look restrained argylle is a rowdy ridiculously overthetop joy ride that only exists to look cool in other words its a film from matthew vaughn kickass kingsman the secret service  the directors latest has enough bullets to stock a gun store and enough fireworks to supply a fourth of july extravaganza not to mention enough stars to fill an oscar party the cast includes henry cavill as a secret agent dua lipa as a bond girl bryce dallas howard as a novelist john cena as a wingman sam rockwell as a hitman samuel l jackson as a cool man and bryan cranston as a mustache twirling villain and the action takes place in a number of breezy locales from glamorous disco halls to glitzy mansions to glorious beaches that will have audiences planning their next vacations theres so much on screen you arent sure where to look but sometimes a movie can have too much going on which is where vaughns latest comes up short weve all seen movies that feel like multiple movies in one argylle is even worse it feels like an entire season of television crammed into two hours of screen time when we first meet argylle cavill hes on the dance floor with a woman lipa in a sparkling gold dress her eyes fixated on his flattop hair the two get down to some funky music but she has undercover agents with her leading to a shootout that builds to a car chase through a coastal village in a stunning conclusion argylles wingman cena snatches the suspect off her motorcycle as if catching a frisbee its an incredibly thrilling moment but then vaughn drains all momentum from his screenplay he cuts to elly conway howard author of the popular argylle series as she types the story we were just watching on screen she isnt sure how she wants to end her latest novel so she decides to take some time off and hops on a train where she meets a real life spy on board aiden rockwell tells her of a shady organization not unlike the one she writes about which is the first of many meta ideas on display reality and fiction begin to collide for elly often within the same scene as she gets swept up in a conspiracy thats based on her adrenalinefueled novels vaughn keeps the action coming at a frenetic pace too tossing various obstacles at his muscular stars the main appeal of argylle is seeing these stars take on numerous villains and like clockwork we get to see cavill and rockwell take on hundreds of extras all at once all the while catchy music blares from the speakers bullets fly in slowmotion bodies pile up like firewood and one liners fly like ammo anyone who has seen vaughns kingsman franchise knows what to expect but something is missing from his latest spy capersomething along the lines of coherence the vivid color palette and the light vibe is a nice change of pace from the dreary blockbusters of late were not sure why action movies have been covered in a haze of self seriousness as if the genre wasnt made to give audiences a fun escape from their daily lives but the meta tone and layered script wears thin fast and eventually you cant keep up with all the plot twists being thrown your way as the story unfoldsboth the novel being written by elly and the characters real life rompit becomes increasingly hard to follow argylle a spy pastiche that lacks any sort of substance
Feb 5 2024,negative, when does a filmmaker run out of something to say thats a question worth asking while watching argylle a new spy movie by matthew vaughn that feels like another blender of a thousand other movies what is most curious about this overcooked extravaganza is how it begins with a very enticing premise the authors of famous bestsellers rarely have an actual reallife connection to the thriller fantasies they concoct what if one of them was suddenly yanked into one of their scenarios vaughns movie begins with that charming premise and a convincing bryce dallas howard before turning into another shootout fest that becomes a parody of itself  the agent argylle of the title is played by henry cavill and opens the movie with a hilariously selfmocking miniadventure in greece also involving another buffed agent john cena a tech guru named keira ariana debose and a steamy dance number with a mysterious woman lagrange dua lipa these turn out to be characters in a series of spy novels by elly conway howard who lives a pretty comfortable life at home with her cat fans are clamoring for the next book which shes busy writing while on a train ride to visit her mother catherine ohara elly bumps into a scruffy weirdo aidan sam rockwell who claims to be a fan to ellys shock he soon takes down a squad of goons before revealing that the writer is being sought by a nefarious organization the division led by director ritter bryan cranston who wants to extract classified information elly apparently has in her mind its not just a case of a good authors overactive imagination after starting off with measured satirical fare like kickass vaughn became a bigbudget name with the xmen and kingsman franchises argylle is a big red blinking warning sign that he needs to return to his roots surely there must be some passion project gathering dust in his desk some of the old fire is almost there in the first act which plays around with the idea of comparing the exaggerated world and look of ellys books with the supposedly rougher reallife action involving aidan who has a normal haircut compared to cavills overdone stylings one of the best jokes in the entire movie has aidan trying to convince elly theres nothing to the old move of crushing a bad guys head with a good foot twist the material also pokes fun at those daring rooftop jumps all action movies feature cavill and john cena are perfectly paired as spoofs of muscular action clichés dua lipa is barely used but would have been great as well in satirizing further the supermodel assassins recycled to death then argylle makes the fatal mistake of giving itself a twist that turns it precisely into just another generic action flick where all the satirical humor is lost boring cgiheavy sequences take over and you feel the movies 2 hours and 19 minutes the screenplay by jason fuchs becomes so convoluted you easily lose track of what the spies are even after a skating gag over spilled oil falls flat because it arrives during an endlessly dragging chase with few good jokes samuel l jackson drops in as the good counter to bryan cranstons sleepy villain both great actors are left with little to do the only other funny wink that lasts is how a coveted notebook belongs to an anarchist named bakunin after marxs anarchic rival in the international vaughns needle drops are also pretty weak the use of the new beatles song released last year now and then is so calculated its almost insulting it turns into the movies love theme but for a romance that never works because howard and dallas lack the necessary chemistry and build up its even more unconvincing when the movie tries hard with a sequence involving guns and heartshaped smoke matthew vaughn is usually a director of colorful style yet lately hes been making movies where the plot gets lost after a good opening his 2021 the kings man had the same issue with good actors and a superb villain who gets killed 20 minutes in then the whole operation goes off the rails its as if he only liked the concept and following studio dogma sapped all enthusiasm argylle has the same problem it opens strongly with an idea we want to see play out all the way to the end why did it need to become the very thing it starts off mocking this movie feels sluggish and timid because it tries too hard to be a blockbuster as the last few months have shown audiences are growing tired of the same old formulas a filmmaker with this much talent shouldnt shy away from turning the rules upside down
Feb 5 2024,positive, with more plot twists than a tartan has squares argylle combines romancing the stone with  well lets not completely give the game away well say it starts out as one of those movies where a woman author unexpectedly finds herself living out one of her novels in argylle writer elly conway bryce dallas howard pens espionage tales rather than romance this immediately raises our hopes as while its always possible to bring something new to a subgenre a lot of the romcom versions of this retread the notion of making fun of romance tropes while simultaneously wanting us to buy into them here readers are impressed with ellys details about spycraft even if her main character argylle henry cavill tends to dress more like 007 than a real undercover agent would elly likes doing book signings and qas and normally she has a good flow but writers block has struck mom catherine ohara suggests that elly visit her parents for the weekend mom will help elly brainstorm so elly  who is phobic about airplanes  packs up her laptop and her beloved cat alfie and takes the train to see the folks instead of reaching her intended destination she finds herself in the middle of some real knives flashing guns blazing spy vs spy action the script by jason fuchs spins us around so successfully that like elly were not sure who to trust either there are so many reveals and reversals that we wind up anticipating more even once theyve effectively stopped director matthew vaughn loves his speeding sparking circling smokeexploding chases and fights with literal dance moves incorporated into some of them this is bond and mission impossible slightly on helium theres a lot to enjoy here including some great scenery plenty of fun surprises and a cast where everybody knows what theyre doing howard displays great versatility and appeal as the protagonist sam rockwell as a shaggy stranger who approaches elly on the train has a role that lets him exhibit charisma and soul which he does with apparent effortlessness one minor gripe is that argylle is occasionally too convinced of its own charm and wit theres an air of selfcongratulation that pops up here and there keeping us at a bit of a remove still overall argylle is clever and fun  probably even worth watching again just to see what clues can be picked up along the way to hint at all the crucial switchbacks once its over its also worth comparing to a certain other spy series and imagining how much livelier that could be with just a touch of argylles spirit
Feb 5 2024,neutral,argylle is a lot matthew vaughn thrives when focusing on these insane yet beautifully shot action sequences but this specific story is all over the place the biggest twists are obvious and certain characters are wasted
Feb 5 2024,negative, across its extensive gimmicky marketing campaign matthew vaughns argylle repeatedly asks one eponymous question who is agent argylle its an enticing almost hitchcockian ask that beckons viewers into uncovering a secret so shocking it threatens to redefine everything they thought they knew about the film but upon its conclusion audiences are left with another important question why should we care its a query that ends up being much more practical especially because vaughns insipid spyaction satire manifests as little more than an amalgamation of all the halfbaked tropes it seeks to make light of in attempting to deconstruct its bondian influences with a winking highconcept plot it retains none of the charm and wit that made them so memorable and most of all enjoyableoften becoming the butt of the joke it aims to deliver at the center of argylle lies novelist elly conway bryce dallas howard who on the heels of her successful 5th entry in the argylle spy novel series hits a creative block drafting the next instalment while on route to visit her mother catherine ohara she runs into the scruffy bumbling aiden sam rockwell in the films sole good performance a reallife operative who informs her that the plot of her latest novel has inadvertently aligned with and exposed the shady activities of a rogue spy organization led by the merciless ritter bryan cranston with a gaggle of evil henchman hunting her she must rely on aiden to not only survive but uncover the conspiracy she finds herself embroiled in argylle hopes to insert a metatextual wrinkle into its globetrotting adventure by having ellys literary creation secret agent argylle henry cavill flicker on screen as a double for aiden but the effect intended to parody spy movies falls flat at each turn particularly because its fictional sequences full of the intentionally corny platitudes 007 might spoutunfold exactly like their real life counterparts neither elly or aiden resemble genuine people sharing more in common with the plasticky caricatures vaughn and company make fun of than anything else cranstons ritter is the walking embodiment of every cliched super villain committed to paper from his menacing grin to his violent treatment of subordinates as a result argylle becomes the very shoddy thinly written caper it clambers to poke holes in repeatedly bobbing for the lowest hanging fruit with groaninducing dialogue like it seems we serve the same master or even worse let the lamb roar what makes matters worse is that argylle thinks were laughing with it during these moments when were really laughing at it any chance of argylles smug metanarrative hitting its target is dashed by the overpolished filmmaking which zaps the experience of any identity and personalitysomething its apparent influences could never be accused of lacking the flatly lit cinematography gives way to a flurry of choppy action sequences that are defined by their overreliance on cheesy slowmotion and reaction shots that moreorless consist of ellys computergenerated feline giving a disgruntled stare vaughns insistence on underpinning these scenes with a steady stream of eyerolling needle dropsthe most soulless of which being the beatles recently recovered now and thenputs an emphatic stamp on how trite and banal argylle feels with each easily predictable and confoundingly convenient twist the films central mystery continues to lack a noticeable bite an unfortunate effect the ceaselessly grating monochromatic flashbacks only serve to heighten the more argylle explains its convoluted plot the less interested we become especially as each revelation forces these already skindeep characters to shift gears and radically alter how they react to one another the result is both jarring and lifeless culminating in a climactic hallway action sequence that aims for the operatic and the idiosyncratic but rings hollow with each feigned maneuver at its best argylle is the cinematic equivalent of a very very dull escape room what could have been a sly satire of the muchadored spy genre is undone by the very foibles and failings that plague them vaughns haphazard attempt to connect it to the kingsman franchise and tease a supposed sequel serves as a final forgettable nail in films coffin if nothing else argylle will make viewers appreciate the spirit of those cheesy overthetop spy movies that much morejust not in the way it intended all of our content is free if you would like to subscribe to our newsletter or even make a small donation click the button below  2024 our culture mag limited all rights reserved use of this site constitutes acceptance of our user agreement updated 1712024 and privacy policy and cookie statement updated 1712024 the material on this site may not be reproduced distributed transmitted cached or otherwise used except with the prior written permission of our culture mag limited
Feb 5 2024,positive, matthew vaughns films dont always hit the target and theyre often accused of being tonally misjudged but theres no denying that he knows how to craft an exciting adrenalised action film full of wit invention and often ludicrous spectacle hes done it again with argylle a witty and clever spy thriller from a script by jason fuchs that constantly surprises with the ingenious twists and turns of a plot that borders on the ridiculous yet never quite topples into extreme parody argylle confounds its audiences expectations from the off in a highenergy action scene clearly intended as a parody of oldschool bond as superspy argylle henry cavill pursues the sultry lagrange dua lipa around vertiginous coastal roads in greece and its as corny as hell then we discover that what were watching is a sequence from the latest spy thriller novel written by bryce dallas howards slightly mousy catloving author elly conway being read to a breathless audience at a book launch reading elly has had huge success with a series of books based on her imaginary spy argylle and when she finds herself facing writers block trying to find a suitable ending for her fifth book she takes a train trip to visit her parents in chicago in search of inspiration but on the train she meets up  coincidentally  with aidan sam rockwell an actual spy who quickly and creatively saves her from being attacked by a group of assassins from a criminal organisation known as the division it turns out that her novels have uncannily predicted the future of their operations and theyre keen to find out what she knows and whats going to happen next the subsequent twoplus hours are a dizzying helterskelter thrill ride of increasingly absurd and frankly impossible action scenes and wild globetrotting wound tightly around a plot that gives a new meaning to farfetched and yet is irresistibly enjoyable because it all works and comes together inside the world the film has created for it howard and rockwell are having a great time and its clear that the rest of the cast are indulging themselves too there are great turns from bryan cranston samuel l jackson catherine ohara and chip the cat and while audiences may have been led to believe that henry cavills the star of the show here his brief twinkling cameos are terrific fun undoubtedly some might find argylles knowingness insufferable and a bit smug and become exasperated by the overuse of cgigreen screen another example of the film playing with its own sense of unreality but if youre in the mood for some fastpaced nonstop irreverent action that turns its own genre inside out then argylles the one for you vaughns plans to launch a new franchise off the back of the film might not fly if early box office is any measure but cest la vie perhaps the campaign to get vaughn on board to direct the next bond film if there ever is one should start here  based on argylle he clearly knows just what it would take to shake 007 out of his doldrums and launch him back into the centre of action cinema again but for now if nothing else argylle is guaranteed to blow away those february blues
Feb 5 2024,neutral, argylle opens with a much promoted premise that many filmgoers will find intriguing if not familiar something supposedly fictional an author is writing may in fact be true in this case could the spy hijinks involving the films titular character henry cavill and written about by author elly conway bryce dallas howard somehow actually be describing real organizations people and threats if yes how exactly is that possible if no whats wrong with conway to be fair trailers for argylle and the film itself quickly discard that second question what matthew vaughns latest film does try to keep closer to the vest is whether conways connection with the events she writes has a perfectly logical explanation as with sandra bullocks loretta sage in the lost city or lies more in a realm of the supernatural think the control emma thompsons karen eiffel has over her characters in stranger than fiction by the time sam rockwells scruffy selfconfessed spy aidan enters and the nameless henchmen start dying its a question of how clever argylle will be and how much fun will we have watching another spyinfused stylish caper from the same director who gave us kingsman the secret service itself a fun romp through a bondadjacent playground unfortunately the answers are not very and not much though its certainly not for lack of trying  on the surface vaughns latest effort possesses an aggressively packaged charm the ensemble cast seems calculated to trip at least one fave from the widest possible population of potential viewers cavill john cena bryan cranston catherine ohara samuel l jackson ariana debose dua lipa a cat its a whos who of oh i like himhermovies with cats any one of which might convince someone to buy a ticket  but much as a beautifully wrapped box can disappoint with whats inside any initial excitement engendered by argylles cast and premise wears away as the supposed ensemble proves more a semblance the twists become tedious and the film suffers from a gradual decay of the many realities needed to undergird any story that wants to tread the fantastic despite an opening sequence featuring cavill cena debose and lipa and richard e grant in an appearance shorter than this parenthetical took to type most of argylles runtime rests on the shoulders of howard and rockwell theyre game but rockwells henchhomicidingso many nameless henchmanand howards extended eek im helpless riff get tiring as does alfie the cat whose presence i suppose is deemed necessary to sell conway as the socially inept cat lady and give the unnecessary cgi crew a paycheck then there are the twists a good twist doesnt just surprise it surprises in a way that in hindsight makes perfect sensethe clues were there all along the twists in argylle feel less like surprises and more like inevitable roads the script has to go down because there are two hours and 20 minutes to kill in this baby as a result the film has barely more suspense than an old scoobydoo episode when a twist of note does happenellys antecedents are less bullocks sage and thompsons eiffel but more geena davis samantha cainewell by then the wheels of absurdity are so routinely flying off the narrative that its hard to enjoy whats left of the ride its too often ignored in genre films involving the fantastical but suspension of disbelief is a gift given by an audience to a storyteller on the condition that the story told will feel real despite all the stuff thats manifestly not true superman can fly but gravity still works on the normies theres a magic spigot that spews forth an endless supply of henchmen but bullets still abide by the laws of physics if you ignore too many of the realities in a movie it can come across as actively dismissive of your audience thats not to say vaughn and scriptwriter jason fuchs are trying to insult us but aidan and ellys henchmenholing holi festival for two and the crude oilcapades that follow come across as sequences that even a group of 10yearolds hopped up on mountain dew would wince at for a cool 200 million and this cast i would have gladly taken less marketing mystery on the front end and more rigor in the actual story
Feb 5 2024,neutral, argylle is so meta that it hurts the film throws thriller writer elly conway bryce dallas howard into a reallife espionage conspiracy that is somehow based on her fictional characters her two worlds collide in a story that piles reversals on top of reversals jason fuchs screenplay may be complex but it is not especially original movies love confounding authors by bringing their characters to life usually to teach lessons about appreciating the real world an actual argylle novel has been published although the book has only tangential connections to the movie one interesting twist here is that elly relates so much to argylle that she turns to him for advice even in the midst of shootouts and car chases and the agent will often interrupt his scenes to complain to her about his dialogue elly and aidan go from colorado in the united states to london the south of france and a palace on the arabian peninsula at each stop they gather clues and shoot their way out of traps then move on to the next cliffhanger detailing more of the plot means giving away its twists which is really all argylle has going for it despite careful engineering the double crosses and betrayals are too often predictable  maybe because they are based on genre clichés the cast includes old and new faces bryan cranston plays the head of an elite espionage agency catherine ohara is an overprotective mum and world wrestling entertainment champion john cena is an improbable computer expert some old friends from earlier vaughn films pop up like samuel l jackson who plays a selfprofessed very cool cat and sofia boutella as a keeper of secrets both singers make outstanding contributions to the soundtrack in fact the best elements of argylle may be its jukebox of pounding dance anthems notably electric energy it has been over 20 years since vaughn helped usher in an entire generation of action stars in films like lock stock and two smoking barrels which he produced and layer cake by comparison argylle feels glossy and overblown and watching it a way to pass time
Feb 5 2024,negative, argyllefor about the first half or so of this action comedy our heroine elly is pulled through chases and shootouts squealing in girlish fright played by bryce dallas howard elly is an author of popular spy thrillers featuring the flawlessly suave secret agent man argylle represented in her minds eye by henry cavill one day on an amtrak train shes accosted by aidan sam rockwell a scruffy obnoxious guy who tells her that shes in grave danger as her books are proving prophetic in realworld counterintelligence within seconds aidan is defending her and her putupon scottish fold cat alfie from countless assassins in extended cartoony handtohand and gun combat all the while dispensing reassurance and encouragement and shes swept off into a globetrotting adventure you may recall that this was the central gag in the lame 2010 comedy night and day with cameron diaz as the civilian and tom cruise as the hypercompetent and comically supportive secret agent man rockwells woebegone manner is funnier and more agreeable than that of cruise but even so too much of this film feels derivative of previous spy parodies both recent and vintage from 2022s bullet train to the mission impossible and bourne flicks and beyond as in many of those films the preposterously overchoreographed action scenes carry no real emotional weight and i found the first part of the movie pretty tedious it started to grow on me after a while though the stars help ive long been inclined to approve of howard with her lush pinup beauty and her sweetness and as elly delves deeper into the case and gains more confidence howard is able to overcome the condescending hysterical woman stereotype shes forced to play along with early on and she and the selfassured sad sack rockwell play off each other nicely and without phony bickering the supporting cast is also topnotch director matthew vaughn and screenwriter jason fuchs would have to work hard to prevent bryan cranston as the fedup evil kingpin or samuel l jackson as another spy boss or the great catherine ohara pestering elly to spend a weekend with mom from giving the audience any amusement along with cavills argylle the movie offers such overtly glamorous types as jon cena and dua lipa and sofia boutella and ariana debose and richard e grant and they add another layer of drollery but just about the time i was loosening up and starting to think that argylle was pretty good after all it overplays its hand in the way of so many contemporary action blockbusters shoveling one exhaustingly explosive finale after another at us at two hours and twenty minutes its at least thirty minutes too long after a while you might start wondering if the movie has ended and youre already a halfhour into argylle 2
Feb 5 2024,negative, matthew vaughn made his name by supercharging the comic book genre with a bit of the old ultraviolence in his adaptation of mark millars graphic novel kickass it wasnt his first film but it arguably launched him into the mainstream this was in 2010 right at the beginning of the superhero boom and a rude lewd rrated 15 in the uk actioncomedy that aped the blossoming earnest genre felt quite novel at the time he tried this schtick again in 2014 with kingsman his take on the british spy movie in which taron egerton plays a lovable oik recruited into a super secret spy organisation vaughn appears to have found his groove with the spy stuff after three kingsman films hes in similar territory with argylle centred around shy author elly conway bryce dallas howard who lives a reclusive life in colorado with her cat alfie played by vaughns wife claudia schiffers cat chip and spends all her time dreaming up adventures for the titular superspy henry cavill with an incredibly unflattering haircut and his partner wyatt a poefaced john cena things take a turn when elly is accosted on a train by aidan sam rockwell who claims to be a huge fan of her workand in the business of espionage himself aidan informs elly shes in grave danger setting in motion a spy caper across the world as the pair attempt to understand why the events of ellys spy series appear to happening in real life a pastiche of spy fodder such as james bond the avengers and the man from uncle there isnt much here in the way of original thought the lost city did the whole neurotic female author gets sucked into the world of her books with more charm back in 2022 and the clicheriddled dialogue feels so dated its as if jason fuchs script was found down the back of a sofa after ten years among the crumbs and lost pocket change speaking of dated  the final beatles song now and then features heavily in argylle perhaps in a synergy move between apple films and apple music whos to say now and then very famously was only released in november 2023 which makes it baffling that argylle attempts to pass off the song as an established classic this used to be our song aidan comments to elly reminiscing about their past argylle is a contemporary film samuel l jackson spends almost all of his screen time watching a lakers game on a giant television which makes this a particularly glaring anachronism that is at best lazy scripting and at worst painful product placement maybe its both at any rate it feels indicative of how slapdash and forced the whole thing is rockwell and howard bless their hearts really try their best with the awful script both are charismatic screen presences even if their characters dont exactly stretch them abilitywise at least howard gets a lot more to do in this film than she ever does in the jurassic world franchise shes been shackled to for a decade less charming is the charisma vacuum dua lipa who appears heavily in the films publicity materials but mercifully only turns up on screen for two short scenes shes a great pop star but no cher when it comes to line delivery there are a few decent action setpieces  notably one where elly skates around on a load of oil and another bafflingly set to xfactor winner leona lewiss cover of snow patrols run  but they lack the grim cartoonish edge of kickass or kingsman and by the time youve seen your second ooh theyre not really dead fakeout of the film the stakes start to shrink dramatically throw into the mix a bloated runtime at once overcomplicated and generic plot and a shockingly cheaplooking aesthetic for a film that supposedly cost 200 million and theres not a whole lot to really enjoy here to vaughns credit at least argylle isnt as gleefully misogynistic as the kingsman films but thats a bit like saying well at least the pigeon shit didnt get in my mouth after a pigeon has shat on your face most ominous of all a midcredit sequence ties the film into the kingsman franchise setting up some sort of horrifying matthew vaughn extended universe what timing just as everyones losing patience with marvel and dc argylle book one  the movie  coming soon a title card

Feb 5 2024,negative, a bestselling spy novelist named elly conway bryce dallas howard looking painfully ill at ease in the role finds herself caught in the middle of a reallife espionage adventure when she is targeted along with her permanently disgruntled pet scottish fold cat by a shadowy syndicate with nefarious intentions dishevelled stranger aidan sam rockwell seems to be protecting her but is he who he says he is is she is anyone do we care and what was dua lipa thinking when she agreed to the dancefloor scene the latest picture from director matthew vaughn is a colossal cumbersome dud structured as a cross between a matryoshka doll full of shock reveals and a partially unravelled piece of knitting it resembles the rejected incoherent offcuts from the kingsman series for all its generic spy movie glitz  we zip between locations in the us london rural france and an aircraft carrier  it has an impoverished synthetic feel in particular the special effects seem shoddy and unfinished and the screenplay struggles to keep up with its own twists and turns the film is apparently the first in a threatened argylle trilogy but i wont hold my breath for parts two and three
Feb 5 2024,negative, stylish smartly edited and bursting with energy the trailer for argylle is fantastic thats about the only thing related to this movie the superlative could be used to describe the actual production is a polar opposite overlong tedious and bursting with idiot plot contrivances there are obvious story holes so big that a 747 flown by a chimpanzee could make it through all the pleasure hinted at by the trailer is illusory  the movies twotier structure is less convoluted than it initially seems or than the trailer makes it appear to be essentially theres a real world setup focusing on bestselling author elly conway bryce dallas howard her cat and her fussy mother ruth catherine ohara then there are enactments of sections of ellys books or phantasms of her imagination featuring her hero the suave superagent argylle henry cavill with an outrageous flattop haircut and his dour sidekick wyatt john cena  ellys life takes a turn for the stranger when while riding a train she meets aidan sam rockwell a fan who claims to be a spy moments later shes dodging knives and bullets in a fight for her life  all while carrying her feline alfie in her backpack soon she and aidan are jetting across the atlantic to keep one step ahead of the shady agents from a shadowy organization run by director ritter bryan cranston who think she has insider knowledge because her books seem to predict the future  argylle gets worse the longer its on screen it opens with a degree of promise vaguely reminiscent of the underrated 2006 romcom stranger than fiction in which a character and his author interact but quickly abandons the quirkier aspects of the narrative to proceed in a more straightforward fashion there are some early warning signs the action is pedestrian theres a lack of energy and the tone is inconsistent by the 90minute mark argylles tongue has become dislodged from its cheek as it devolves into a jason bournemission impossible ripoff those are more applicable comps than bond with a lot of pointless action and lackluster stunts but none of this adequately prepares the viewer for the mindnumbing final act wherein those previously mentioned gaping plot holes appear one related to a convoluted identity issue and one involving the inexplicable decision not to kill two characters as the plot goes into a corkscrew nosedive from which it never recovers not even a multihued smoke massacre set to a pop tune can save this movie from a complete implosion  theres less henry cavill than one might expect or hope for he makes occasional appearances in recreations of scenes from ellys books and occasionally appears to her during fight scenes when he and rockwell are spliced together as the lead bryce dallas howard is fine in the first half and miscast during the second despite getting a lot of screen time in the trailer dua lipa has virtually none in the movie pretty much all of her material is used in the trailer qualifying her appearance as a cameo ditto for richard e grant and ariana debose john cena and samuel l jackson get more onscreen time but have little to do beyond collecting paychecks as for bryan cranston as the villain  his frothing at the mouth seems oddly halfhearted hes not necessarily more grounded than a generic bond megalomaniac but isnt any more interesting and im still not entirely sure what his motives are  director matthew vaughn has an uneven resume but until he became mired in the kingsman universe the first film was good the other two not so much he was a solid bet for a good time his early films  layer cake kickass and kingsman the secret service  were enjoyable romps argylle represents his first outandout failure indications are that vaughn isnt done with the kingsman movies  a postcredits scene offers a tangible connection between argylle and that series  vaughn is apparently going for something thats one part cartoonish action and one part tongueincheek parody it misfires on all cylinders even if one takes nothing seriously which is really the only way to approach argylle the action fails to excite and the comedy is flaccid i didnt laugh once and the movies stylized and satirical tone defused any connection i might have felt for the characters perhaps if the proceedings hadnt dragged on well past the twohour mark it wouldnt have seemed like such a chore to sit through the films failure stands as a stark reminder that no matter how seductive a trailer might be february releases should always be approached with caution this is the month when hollywood jettisons its refuse and this particular sampling belongs buried deep in a landfill
Feb 5 2024,negative, the end credits for matthew vaughns 200 million flop argylle contain a scene linking this misguided venture into another doa franchise the dormantforareason kingsman series vaughn clearly anticipates an endless porridge pot of funding for films he clearly loves to make but audiences hate to watch paying customers are right to feel aggrieved billed as an allstar ensemble thriller this apple tv production features three line cameos from john cena and ariana debose about ten minutes of a hammy henry cavill failing his bond audition badly and pop singer dua lipa wisely exits before the six minute mark youd do well to do the same as her although not going to see this at all is a far better move reverse word of mouth will stop argylle making half its budget back although apple wont care since were picking up the tab buying their overpriced cables after a resistible cgi cartoon opening set in greece to a barry white soundtrack were off to a subromancing the stonelost city adventure with jk rowlinglevel authoress elly conway bryce dallas howard a successful spy novelist with gasp no man in her life whats wrong with her  theres a reason i write about spies not romance she explains but where does elly get her ideas from superspy aidan sam rockwell engineers a meeting cute on an amtrak train after a booksigning but their first encounter turns into the usual hyperkinetic brawl while a remix of sylvesters do you wanna funk plays pointlessly over the fakey action then were off to london then arabia then an oiltanker somewhere but were never more than a few feet from cheapo greenscreen with phonedin performances to match why does this keep happening asks elly and shes got a point vaughns been plugging this line for ten years despite collapsing public interest this is bs is another line from elly that answers her own question precisely jason fuchs script throws out such exhausted subsitcom zingers as french people give me the crepes namechecks include steve jobs twice jeffrey dahmer once product placement for the savoy hotel three unwanted plays for the beatles now and then and a phonedin monologue from samuel l jackson about the quality of pinot noir its hard to imagine why snow patrol would licence a cover of their song light up for a scene of elly stabbing multiple soldiers through their ribcages but i guess money talks it just doesnt say anything coherent in vaughns hands argylle is a hot mess theres some ramblings about mk ultra on steroids to justify a series of ungainly plottwists but its also just smug aggressive garbage featuring offensive racist and sexist stereotypes girls cant land a punch while boys kill dozens with ease and a late plot twist doesnt diffuse notions firmly in line with vaughns similarly misogynist kingsman films and the trip to arabia is less than culturally enlightening or sensitive so why are apple putting their sainted branding on this we understand the importance of inimitable behaviour in movies so whats funny about characters dropping cats or even throwing them off buildings to see how they land even the poster image of a cat in a backpack is irresponsible you simply cant just pick up an unsuspecting animal and use it as a fashion accessory without causing it considerable distress despite mugging support from catherine ohara and bryan cranston argylle sucks and blows simultaneously for 139 minutes the february dumping ground for broken unwanted product is an old cinematic tradition whats surprising is seeing apple cheerfully adding their brand to the bonfire of outmoded and unwanted product and suckering universal into releasing it sure maybe the cast emerge with nice apple gear and a fat paycheck but audiences may well never want to see their smug irritating faces in any context after this enduring this lump of freshly dumped barry white i wouldnt go so far as to call it that bad argylle just needed more focus and a better direction for its few creative action sequences the constant plot twists are really what started to go overboard for me along with ripping off a certain 90s action movie that happened to costar samuel l jackson as well traffic bad got cold waiting on the roof for you even in my argyle sweater have to change it to a jump from the roof of fraggles shed the number one movie last week sounds like you might have missed something perhaps time for a rewatch if cavill is only in it for 10 minutes why does he have pole position on the poster id also like to know whats not funny about throwing cats off buildings i think you know the answers to both of these questions deep down in your heart of hearts but instead ill say 1 why is the films actual female protagonist sandwiched in a row of actors do you can barely notice her well he never listens to me when i tell him to stop watching bad movies just like holmes never listened to watson about his coke habit so id say the similarities are pretty similar on that front as for you and mrs hudson im pretty sure she was a widow so sorry fraggle phils just gotta go this demo site is only for demonstration purposes all images are copyrighted to their respective

Feb 4 2024,positive, it was evident from the moment the trailers released that matthew vaughns argylle would be a film that doesnt take itself too seriously its outlandish all over the place and bonkers in the best way stacked with a fantastic cast who undoubtedly had a blast while filming the joy in argylle is infectious once a viewer releases any preconceived notions of what it should be and chooses to fully embrace all the firstrate tropes it throws into a delicious mixing pot a large part of the problem with the films unfavorable critical reception is that people are taking it way too seriously this movie isnt meant to be the next bond franchise nor does it ever market itself to be its also a little comedic that vaughns unique style of filmmaking isnt a bold giveaway for the kind of narrative thatll unfold when the kingsman movies exist a movie doesnt always have to be a profound character study with a complex theme to be greatsometimes movies can and should just be fun and this one surely is the most hilarious thing about argylle is that the twist was revealed years ago in a press release but even with the knowledge of who the real agent is its loads of fun to watch it all unfold the premise is already eccentric but its worth noting that jason fuchs screenplay is sharp enough to never border on cringeworthy territory theres plenty of meat in the character dynamics to sell something that will be indelible especially for the romance genre girlies with that said yes argylle is a romance through and through which is entirely where its appeal comes from with this critic films are so often afraid of pushing romance because prestigious genres consistently disregard anything with an unapologetic happy ending the idea of bond getting the girl in the end so often translates to but later bond also loses the girl we seldom get happy endings in spy dramas which quite frankly then just makes them overly formulaic yet whos out there calling it that when its dark and gritty enough to meet the standards the expectations set very few ultimately argylle thus does something different by placing love at the centerfold sprinkling it with the right amount of nuance to make every beat feel earned even while you cant believe whats unraveling in front of you because its so wildly chaotic no storyteller is getting right when it comes to espionage in film and televisionthats part of the appeal because most filmmakers arent actual spies and so much of what we know is embellished no matter how accurate it tries to be so its a little ironic not to admit that the dramatization is part of the appeal anyone who watched and adored nbcs chuck will tell you that the eccentric twist is part of its charm and in some ways the romance in argylle is ultimately how i imagine chuck could continue if it ever does as a leading lady bryce dallas howards elly conway is a fantastic character to follow along with the journey she goes on is pretty darn rewarding no matter how predictable and the shifts between elly and rachel give howard meaty material to work withskating through a gas leak with knives under her boots iconic who wouldnt want to do that the film ensures that the characters arc toward unlocking her memories feels earned which is part of the reason why its so gripping when you let it play along as it wants to pair bryce dallas howard with a chameleon actor like sam rockwell and youve got yourself the kind of duo worth investing in for multiple films as an avid romance reader i initially assumed the two would fall in love along the way but to learn that they were in love is a detail i didnt know i needed until it was revealed tying it all back to henry cavills agent argylle and john cenas wyatt is just icing on the top of the cake we might not get their initial meet cute but the chemistry is enough to make their relationship worth investing in rockwell is so genuinely vulnerable when he confesses it all that the butterflies are bound to start a frenzy for anyone whos into adorable affirmations cavill fully leans into every stereotype of a suave spy despite the absurd hairstyle working against him dua lipa shouldve had more screen time catherine ohara is as brilliant as ever bryan cranston is delightfully sinister ariana debose effectively steals every scene shes in samuel l jackson works his magic through and through and despite cgi shenanigans alfie the cat wins all the brownie points
Feb 4 2024,negative, argylle finds successful spy novelist elly conway bryce dallas howard in the midst of a writers block even though she has written four novels about james bondesque super spy agent argylle henry cavill hes suave cool and never breaks a sweat even as he finds out he can no longer trust anyone its the cliffhanger that causes elly to find herself stuck she seeks guidance from her cat alfie but he proves less than helpful ellys mom catherine ohara offers to help brainstorm so elly hops on a train with alfie in tow its on this journey where she meets reallife spy aidan sam rockwell who tells her that her life is in danger ellys novels have somehow managed to predict geopolitical events and real spy activities a secret organization wants to kidnap elly and force her to write the next chapter aidan is her only chance at survival director matthew vaughn is most known for kingsman the secret service its a slick stylistic spy flick that spurred a sequel and a prequel although neither reached the same heights as the first movie the same can be said for argylle vaughns latest is torn between being a romantic adventure comedy and a twistturny spy caper what made kingsman come alive were the action sequences the sharply written dialogue and the use of music to elevate the fight scenes argylle is trying to capture that same lightninginabottle essence but its missing the almost manic sensibility the argylle trailer claims that the film comes from the twisted mind of vaughn but its fairly reserved after the kingsman scene of colin firth fighting an entire church set to free bird the bar is quite high argylle tries to create some of that magic again with a ballet and iceskating fight scene for the climax but it comes across very stilted its as though someone is trying to replicate the thrill of vaughns previous works without fully understanding how to go about doing that its not just the fight sequences either theres a distinct lack of chemistry among the characters the script doesnt offer anything interesting for elly and aidan to banter playfully about other than alfie the cat and aidans allergies even then both are quickly forgotten when they dont service the plot its their central relationship that the film hinges on but theres no spark between them to keep argylle on the rails what goodwill argylle does manage to garner in the beginning is fully undone by all the twists the film throws at the audience the main one was actually spoiled years ago when the movie was initially announced and another is revealed in the trailer fear not more fairly obvious twists are sprinkled throughout and vaughn tosses out one in the final scene and a very last one midcredits by the end of argylle the audience is left feeling as though the movie was made by someone attempting to emulate the style of kingsman or john wick but never fully committing theres also an undercurrent of romance that grows as the film progresses but it seems that argylle doesnt want to lean into an action romance what a shame that ends up being for the film tonally argylle cannot find its groove it falters as it desperately tries to oneup itself with a new twist every few minutes this is not a plea for simplicity but to streamline the plot so that argylle could have been wackier stranger and goofier there are glimpses of that version but the cat came a little too far out of the bag

Feb 4 2024,neutral, reviewed by dennis schwartzbrit filmmaker matthew vaughn kingsman trilogykickass directs this plodding preposterous and laborious spy actioncomedy thriller the misfire is performed by a fine starstudded ensemble cast that tries but cant save this convoluted mess its written with more twists than a fork full of spaghetti by jason fuchs it offers a satirical riff on james bond the story is taken from the one that featured kathleen turner in the 1984 romancing the stone its comedy is not funny its cgi is of an inferior quality its length is too long and its nutty unoriginal story lacks intrigue  elly conway bryce dallas howard a cat loving pet owner residing in a cabin in the isolated mountains of colorado is almost finished with her latest novel but needs some help she discovers after giving it a public reading thereby shes on a train bound for chicago to get help on the last chapter from her mother catherine ohara shes traveling with alfie her computer generated scottish fold cat in her backpack that has a porthole to see the cata  passenger is seated near her who tells her that shes in grave danger that person is the rogue agent aidan wilde sam rockville he further tells her that her plot in the latest serial edition about her hero protagonist the superspy aubrey argylle henry cavill the brit actor who played superman is similar to whats actually happening in the real world that the bad guys have the same plotline she does in her novel as it involves a similar covert government organization called the directorate thats headed by the corrupt madman ritter bryan cranston the criminal group think elly has inside information about a flash drive that could expose their evil deedsthereby the bad guys are after elly on the train who is helped by aidan to elude thembut nothing in the story is what it seems as there are numerous plot changes and doublecrosses atop of doublecrosses the pic is so illogical that even the fictional agent argylle shows his face to help elly bring down the bad guys by subbing for aidan during his fight sequencesthe film is visually stylish and delivers its violent mayhem with cartoonish pizzazz as in one fight elly is trapped in the bathroom and we only see whats happening by who flies past the bathroom door in a better fight sequence theres a shootout amid gorgeous plumes of brightlycolored smoke pop singer dua lipa plays a murderous femme fatale working for the directorate while the miscast bryce dallas howard shows no talent for the comedy her role requires only rockvilles quirky performance is entertaining this ridiculous escapist movie was filmed with no restraint for its excesses its so poorly edited that you couldnt escape from its nonsense without exiting the movie theater 
Feb 4 2024,negative,argylle is written terribly in certain spots when it came to getting these characters out of dangerous situations they always had a lazy lastminute save that didnt make any sense 
Feb 4 2024,negative, argylle is exhausting there is plenty of terrific stuff including a charmingly bubbly performance by star bryce dallas howard thats reminiscent or maybe a crafty amalgamation  of what kathleen turner brought to the screen in 1984s romancing the stone or deborah kerr achieved in 1950s king solomons mines theres also an unsurprising and effortlessly amiable turn from sam rockwell if someone made an adultoriented 90minute romcom with the pair id be first in line to give it a look but at nearly 140 minutes this actionmysterythrillercomedy hybrid doesnt know when to quit the film showcases all of director matthew vaughns best and worst tendencies with a truly great scene immediately followed by two or three more that frequently ran the gamut from unnecessarily pointless to adolescently puerile to outright unredeemable i was offended and enthralled in almost equal measure and if not for the fact that the final 30 minutes left me cold id almost recommend watching this catastrophically outlandish adventure if only because the experience is so bewilderingly  and at times agonizingly  unique like some sort of adolescent remix of ideas covered by any number of authors but most notably james thurber philip k dick richard condon and robert ludlum screenwriter jason fuchs wonder woman pan delivers a convoluted story involving a popular writer of espionage fiction and perky catlover elly conway howard who suddenly finds herself living out one of her own adventures shes delivered four books revolving around an unstoppable secret agent named argylle and all of them have been massive hits problems arise when elly is on the threshold of delivering her eagerly anticipated fifth entry in the series but before she can finish the final chapters a bevy of actual spies show up on a train trying to kidnap her shes saved by aidan wilde rockwell and in between fists bullets some shattered glass and even a bona fide explosion he explains to elly why her life is inexplicably in danger her agent argylle stories really happened vaughn leans into the same sort of visual aesthetic he utilized for his kingsman trilogy only this time he blurs fantasy and reality several steps past that the reason is that elly has trouble differentiating between the dream world of her fictional characters portrayed by the likes of john cena dua lipa ariana debose richard e grant and henry cavill as agent argylle himself and the suddenly chaotic real ones led by rockwell bryan cranston as the powermad director ritter head of a rogue intelligence agency samuel l jackson as the retired former head of the cia and a sublime catherine ohara as ruth ellys cheerfully domineering mother its a solid idea and vaughn does get some decent mileage out of playing with it the first largescale action sequence has rockwell and cavill continually switching places as every time elly blinks she imagines her suave classically attractive fictional hero throwing the punches the foulmouthed comically unkempt aidan is actually trading with a neverending cadre of lethal adversaries a few visual glitches notwithstanding the entire set piece is marvelously shot by cinematographer george richmond free guy and edited by the team of tom harrisonread tomb raider and lee smith dunkirk and the films talented stunt team is deserving of applause but vaughn doesnt know when to quit his cartoonish presentations and rapid cuts between elly and aidan on the run agent argylles imaginary domain director ritters secret lair which is more reminiscent of austin powers than james bond and a tranquil picturesque french winery gave me whiplash the noticeably cgheavy sets and locations are garish like something out of a playstation or xbox video game and not a recent one there is a repetitiveness to the action thats sadly obnoxious and dont get me started on the running gags involving ellys adorable cat alphie who spends most of the narrative being carted around in a designer petfriendly backpack then there are the twists and turns without giving any hints vaughn and fuchs take far too long to finally spill beans about their biggest mystery and by the time they do id long since figured it out so their revelation hit with a resounding thud worse once the truth is revealed this gives vaughn license to play to his baser instincts reveling in acts of cruelty and violence that feel like sensationalism for its own sake a trait that also afflicted kingsman the golden circle and the kings man and in my opinion made both borderline unwatchable there are a pair of insane sequences inside director ritters headquarters  one with multicolored gas bombs and another involving macgyvered ice skates and a floor covered in crude oil  that come tantalizingly close to being as fun as they are obviously meant to be but much like everything else in this picture vaughn lets them run on far too long each goes from being goofily amusing to annoyingly tiresome and thats too bad if only because howard is just so goshdarn wonderful as the films plucky protagonist i really do want to cut argylle some slack but so much of it is far too bludgeoning by the time the climax rolls around theres so little differentiation between ellys imaginative literary domain and the supposedly real lifeordeath one that my emotional investment in anyones survival  including hers  was

Feb 4 2024,positive, the loopy spy caper argylle has more plot twists and jackknifes than the fast  furious franchise tug on any thread and youll get a hole yet with director matthew vaughn best known for kickass and the kingsman films one expects foolishness this isnt tinker tailor soldier spyor even the spy who loved me argylle is preposterous and messy but ive seen worse and without the good cheer of bryce dallas howard and sam rockwell its pitched at a heightened reality with cartoonish stunts overthetop action zany dance choreography and disco music i doubt ill see another sequence this year with someone on jerryrigged knifeblade ice skates slaying enemies in a sitspin or people twirling in a gunfight among smoke canisters that bloom into technicolor hearts the cockamamie setup sees howard jurassic world dominion as elly conway a wildly successful author drawn into some real lifeordeath stuff its like romancing the stone or any of its 1980s imitators except instead of romance elly writes espionage novels about secret agent argylle henry cavill the witcher sporting a green velvet suit and a flattop haircut on the trail of a rogue spy agency on the cusp of her latest novels release a real rogue agency wants to kill or capture elly because her books mirror their hunt for a flash drive containing the goods to expose their evildoings we never learn what those are and this agency hasnt been able to lay its hands on this device in five years so they dont exactly inspire fear bryan cranston asteroid city tries scowling and barking at underlings clacking on keyboards when theyre not pursuing elly enter sam rockwell see how they run as aiden a rogue operative from said agency who rides to ellys rescue to reach the widget first hes in league with samuel l jackson the marvels as an excia guy jackson has a hideout at a french winery where he spends part of the movie watching basketball like a low key nick fury rockwells shaggydog screwball demeanor and his penchant for dancing inspire much of the comedy literally butting up against ellys idea of a suave superspy in an early fight scene editors tom harrisonread and lee smith cut between rockwell kicking butt and getting his handed to him while ellys brain toggles between this roughandtumble fellow and cavill winking dodging and decking aiden has his own particular set of skills though he leaps up through wooden floorboards and takes out operatives better than trinity in the matrix then demonstrates how to smash a skull while doing a little soft shoe elly grated on me at first she has an overbearing mother catherine ohara pain hustlers nagging her to find a date wears pajamas while working talks to and snuggles her cat and runs and squeals once the trouble starts howard has a natural warmth and an endearing charm that helps smooth over this but i thought the accomplished director dads the mandalorian deserved better happily elly evolves but couldnt screenwriter jason fuchs i still see you avoid such creaky sexist stereotypes knowing argylles biggest twist the film couldve been a lot wackier especially in the relationships between cavill and the underused john cena and ariana de bose as the fictional spys backup that said its fun enough if you let the lunacy roll valerie kalfrin is an awardwinning crime journalist turned freelance film writer whose work appears at rogerebertcom in their own league script the hollywood reporter and other outlets also a screenwriter and script consultant shes passionate about challenging stereotypes about gender and disability lets tell better stories and tell stories better
Feb 4 2024,positive, matthew vaughn is back with his weird director self in argylle and im not mad about it wondering if argylle is kid friendly this comedic spy thriller is appropriately rated pg13 but there are some things to watch for if younger viewers want to get in on this action heres what parents need to know in this argylle parents guide bryce dallas howard stars as elly conway the reclusive author of a series of bestselling espionage novels who just wants to hang at home with her computer and cat alfie but when the plots of ellys fictional books and the characters seemingly come to life she realizes they may want her dead her fictional secret agent argylle and his mission to unravel a global spy syndicate isnt so fictional after all  there is a lot of language in argylle including uses of sht bullsht a ahole damn bich and fck there are also uses of deity including gd jesus and gddamn there is no nudity in argylle however there are a couple of sexual innuendos and characters are seen kissing there is also some provocative dancing sexual content is kept pg13  as far as content is concerned argylle is kid friendly for ages 13 and older a lot of vaughns movies are usually rated r so we do get toned down blood and gore language is heavy argylle is a ton of fun but also chaotic and bizarre its the ridiculousness that makes me laugh and thats whats so entertaining im not sure why it doesnt annoy me like other movies do when they go off the rails but if youre not into weird then you probably wont be into it packed with plenty of star power argylle doesnt quite utilize them to their full potential and the cgi well its a little messy i love a good globetrotting adventure when i can at least ogle the scenery but i wasnt ogling too much here will teens be into argylle if they are into the kingsman franchise then theyll appreciate the cheesiness and humor and if you really dug the epic fight scene in the kings man then get ready for another one  argylle will give you action romance comedy intrigue twists turns and wackiness what more could you ask for besides a bit of a stronger plot restraint better cgi and cohesion psh tomato tomahto 
Feb 4 2024,negative,there are some jokes that land and a few fun action scenes but overall the writing is not good the cgi is terrible the amount of plot twists is going to give you whiplash and the movie is way too long
Feb 3 2024,negative, argylle has been so heavily promoted in the uk that people have been joking that the only safe space from the trailer was in the movie itself the reason its being pushed so heavily has on the surface to do with the director matthew vaughn trying to reestablish his credibility after the kingsman movies have skidded off the rails the reason this critic wanted to see it was because of the hype suggested it was an appreciation of the works of a woman writer but thats not the case its propaganda in service of claiming art created by artificial intelligence is as good as the real thing theres even several scenes featuring now and then the beatles song built in a sound deck and released in 2023 while pretending to have vocals sung by john lennon the whole experience is not even a triumph of bad taste argylle is a test balloon sent up by a major movie studio to see if well accept ai in movies the way weve come to accept cgi do not fall for it if you have been lucky enough to be spared seeing the trailer author elly bryce dallas howard has enjoyed enough success with her series of thrillers about a spy named argylle henry cavill who by taking this part has accepted hell never be playing james bond that she owns a colossal lakeside house in remote colorado shes finishing the fourth in the series though her mother catherine ohara doesnt like the ending so elly puts her cat in one of those stupid pet backpacks and gets on a train to go see her a chatty man named aidan sam rockwell plops himself across from her and then proceeds to kill about a dozen people who are trying to kill elly first its all so cleanly choreographed and with such bad cgi that theres nothing to be felt watching it but since were supposed to pretend elly and aidan end up on the run together pursued by a secret agency led by bryan cranston that thinks the argylle books are a secret predictive spy code or something mostly youll wonder why they went to all the trouble of having the cat be a cgi creation though the fact aidan is able to spirit elly over multiple international borders without her having a passport is a headscratcher too thats enough of the plot which contains enough fakeouts gratuitous death underuse of really interesting actresses namely ariana debose dua lipa and sofia boutella and bad guys with such bad aim they couldnt hit the side of a barn if they were strapped to it to not be interesting on any level the only fresh sequence   of combat ice skating done in an engine room slick with spilled oil by someone using knives strapped to shoes as adhoc blades  loses all its intrigue thanks to enough digital fakery to completely remove any sense of threat but the plot is driven by the sense that ellys imagination is a predictive resource for reallife spy intrigue while the intrigue itself is a pastiche of approximately a thousand other thrillers with modern surveillance culture thrown in on top  which brings us back to the movies main purpose to treat ellys brain as the ultimate ai machine where hints from her mother plot suggestions over email from socalled fans and copious oldfashioned book research combine by some magical mysterious process thats never called talent to enable elly to write her smash hits well ignore the fact that the plot as written plays a ludicrously slow long game surely they could just have had elly discussing her book ideas on tiktok instead of actually writing anything which also seems to be the present literary way but even as the movie goes on and on and on about what a clever genius she is jason fuchs screenplay is also very keenly like the notorious tweet where someone called writers ideas landlords didnt you know artists have no right to keep their own idea to themselves when there are other people who want to profit from them  so this is where we are in the current moment ideas are such valuable currency that dozens of faceless henchmen die to keep elly and her ideas alive but at the same time ellys ideas really belong to the people who suggested them to her and that explains why they had to push the trailer so hard without this being forced down our throats wed never choose to swallow it people who really love art dont want it made by machines they want art made by people irritating demanding sparky people unpredictable people if argylle becomes a success thats what well lose
Feb 3 2024,neutral, when i first saw argylles trailer it reminded me of sandra bullocks 2022 comedy the lost city where she too played a reclusive romance author who got swept up in an adventure with her novels cover model well the plot of matthew vaughns latest movie centers on elly conway an introverted female author of a very popular spy book series starring secret agent argylle somehow her novel hits too close to reality involving a sinister global spy syndicate the trailer makes it out to be a wishfulfillment fantasy for henry cavills fans who desperately want to see him as james bond though the british super spy wouldnt ever be caught dead sporting such a goofy haircut cavill basically acts like suave 007 in the opening scene with dua lipa doing her best bond girl audition in a slinky gold dress the nod to bond movies is obvious think of roger moores tongueincheek version but ten times sillier speaking of bond while goldfingers got pussy galore argylle has an actual pussycat ellys scottish fold alfie that she carries in her argyle backpack its amusing to see bryce dallas howard in an action comedy shes no stranger to action flicks with the jurassic world franchise i mean who could forget her running away from a trex in high heels but here she gets to flex her comedic muscles as well though shes often relegated to looking discombobulated as she gets dragged kicking and screaming into a highoctane action adventure the first meetup on the train of elly and aidan wilde sam rockwell who claims to be a real spy is a mix between the train scene in casino royale where bond trade banters with vesper and the insane fight scenes of bullet train howard and rockwell are fun to watch together with the latter being the clear mvp just for his smooth dance moves alone now as the adventure kicks into high gear with ceaseless twists and turns along the way the movie practically veers into the fastpaced screwball comedy genre a la naked gun hot shots or johnny english so your enjoyment of the movie depends on how you feel about those movies i kind of had an inkling what kind of movie this was going to be when i watched bryan cranstons interview with stephen colbert where he said his inspiration for his villain character ritter is steve carrells gru from the minion franchise nuf said known for his rrated action movies ie layer cake kickass and the kingsman franchise vaughn certainly has a thing for clandestine societyorganization the movies tagline once you know the secret dont let the cat out of the bag seems to be a hint for early viewers not to worry you wont find spoilers here what i can say is vaughns brand of spy actioner looks to have diminishing returns x men first class is one of my favorites in the xmen franchise definitely one of the smartest superhero movies to date i love the first kingsman movie kingsman the secret service its stylish edgy witty and fun that makes a star out of taron egerton but the last two lack the ingenuity of the original the third kingsman movie aims for a clever revisionist history but the result is an uneven tonallyoff action thriller argylle has the potential to be a clever spin on the spy genre but despite the dynamic action sequences the movie is bogged down by the overly elaborate plot and cartoonish humor the script by jason fuchs who got a story credit for wonder woman keeps the movie in constant topsyturvy mode attempting to be one step ahead of viewers expectations vaughn doubles down on the ridiculous action scenes accompanied by retro 80s pop music electric energy a disco pop song featuring boy george and ariana debose who has a small role in the movie is catchy and i have to admit some of the bombastic actions are amusing theres the lovers danceshootout amidst rainbowcolored smoke bombs iceskating followed by ellys ludicrous ice er oilskating sequence by attaching knives to her shoes as she gleefully takes out multiple baddies as imaginative as vaughn is with the casting ie catherine ohara as ellys mother who akin to every character here is much more than meets the eye this brainless caper also wastes the immense talent of so many oscar winnersnominees samuel l jackson is basically just having a good time playing his mischievous self but i wish there were more john cena as hes got more charisma than pretty boy cavill the movies scene stealer is alfie the cat whose real name is chip the gray feline who reminds me of the bond franchises blofelds persian cat actually belongs to vaughns wife claudia schiffer argylle gets exhausting after a while and the jokes become repetitive and less funny as the movie goes on and on needlessly for 2 hours and 19 minutes i kind of tuned out by the climactic fight scene lets just say some elements remind me of a major plot in marvels captain america movies if you stick around long enough for the postcredit scene youll find out that vaughn has plans to expand his spythemed universe by mixing argylle with his kingsman franchise with potential crossover later on cant say im clamoring for more of this type of risible spy thriller thats absurdly expensive to make it costs 200 million to make before marketing with not much to show for it no wonder the movie is released on the dumping ground month before it heads for streaming on apple tv what i do want to see more of is sam rockwell in more action comedies hopefully in something with much better material worthy of his talent when i saw trailer of this i thought it was some sort of perfume commercial and not a real movie lol i dont know if i want to waste my time on watching this after seeing two terrible action comedies that apple tv produced ghosted and the family plan a perfume commercial mwahahaha well cavill wont ever get a job in any perfume commercial with that haircut ahah its even dumber than the movie yeah i dodged the bullet w ghosted and the family plan thanks to you sorry ted this film is getting some lukewarm reviews as i think it tries to do too much  yes that is a terrible haircut for henry cavill only made 18 million in its opening weekend against a 200 million budget   unless word of mouth is good like elemental did when it flopped in its first weekend only to come back because of word of mouth  this film is fucked film is in my blood love movies of all genres from jane austen to james bond official blogger for the twin cities film fest tcff ive written and produced my first short film  hearts want in 2017 and currently working on developing the full story as a feature film
Feb 3 2024,positive,despite the narrative and lengthwise excesses it achieves the mission of dazzling your senses and detonating laughter full review in spanish
Feb 3 2024,positive, a loose genre id call starstudded fun is making a comeback and boy does it not mix with our sarcastic unimpressed times serious film critics in reality we are not a serious lot always turned their noses up at these movies theyre too obviously lowbrow too winky at the audience regular filmgoers who have always turned up for these movies dont need them as much either they have regular access to even the biggest celebrities so seeing them all smooshed together onscreen whether at awards shows or in castdriven movies doesnt carry the same thrill it used to and yet were getting a new round of hercule poirot movies and the bevy of straighttostreaming larks like red notice and the gray man and now argylle argylles fleetfooted spy hijinks are more of a kind with red notice and it will stream on apple tv shortly but first the behemoth gets a theatrical release which begs the question what are its aspirations like so many red notices before it its not worth the price of a movie ticket but a lazy afternoon stream in a few months sure so why the theatrical run argylle is convoluted but simple enough to be diverting it starts out with a stylish sexy spy mission where henry cavills argylle is sniffed out and everything devolves into a thrilling chase the cheese and poor cgi is so egregious that your hackles might rise but wait turns out this is an excerpt from the hit argylle books and everything youve seen comes from the mind of its author elly conway bryce dallas howard things settle into a more palatable level of absurd clichés in the films real world elly is a single anxious cat lady living through the adventures she creates but then shes pulled into the real world of espionage by sam rockwells aidan who says her books are so on point that shes calling out real spy world events and on and on and on the twists come none are overly surprising and some veer into tiresome but none are rested on too long to grind things to a halt the twists mean a huge cast of characters come and go a perfect setup for your favorite stars to come to set for a few days and churn out a couple scenes the main joy or at least curiosity of seeing argylle with other people is hearing everyone react to their favorites my heart though belongs to the films main duo to be clear i love sam rockwell theres a running joke about how unimpressive rockwells aiden is compared to the suaveness of cavills argylle but give me a scruffy goof over suave any day every one of rockwells head tilts elevate the thoroughly meh argylle and without him the movie wouldve been a loss bryce dallas howard is comfortably pleasant here as well and together the pair strike tones and poses that have more personality than the bythenumbers script deserves proving that theyre the ones making the material and not the other way around the film gives both a late glowup intending to make them look and act more like glamorous spies and i almost revolted i mean whatever poofing they did to rockwells hair was bad enough but making howard a blonde no this plot twist marks the beginning of the end of argylles fun not only does it start thoroughly wasting the charm of its two leads but it spins the tone too far into director matthew vaughns endless attempt to recapture kingsmans glory the first kingsman to be clear neither the sequel nor prequel lived up to the zany energy of the original and neither does the climax of argylle as much as it wants to these sequences feel like theyre from an entirely different movie than argylle not just unnecessary but jarring and deflating the rest of the movie had zipped by with a pleasantly medium level of energy its sudden reach for wacky elaborate action is not what a lazy afternoon movie needs if argylle had peppered in this energy earlier it wouldve felt of a piece and perhaps the film wouldve earned its bigscreen release as is all that money and all those stars only add up to a mildly entertaining romp its not enough of a mess to be mad at maybe because i cant be mad at this much sam rockwell goodness but i was certainly left wanting a better ending and more sam rockwell
Feb 3 2024,positive, matthew vaughn put a fresh spin on the spy genre with his film kingsman the secret service hes back at with a new spy character who is full of surprises in argylle henry cavill makes for the quintessential spy with his dashing good looks british accent and the ability to take anyone down hes got his team ready to help behind the scenes to aid in his escape plan theyre played by john cena and ariana debose  he can get out of any situation as he has for four different adventures see theyre characters in a spy novel series written by elly conway whose played by bryce dallas howard shes out promoting her fourth novel while putting the finishing touches on the fifth book ellys books have oddly predicted what happens in the real espionage world she finds herself caught up in a real spy adventure when she meets sam rockwells character on a train who tells her shes in grave danger and that a sinister group is out to use her to predict where some dangerous codes and files could be located she finds herself in way over her head as life imitates art and she has no one to trust except her cat alfie matthew vaughns argylle is meant to be taken as a wild twisty nod to the spy genre that acknowledges all the tropes and silly characters along the way vaughn certainly leans into this from the beginning with its bombastic fast and the furiousstyle chase sequences that defy any sense of logic every actor seems in on the style and is clearly having a blast leaning into the heightened acting that comes with the genre vaughn lets them play into what they do best from bryan cranston leaning into the evil leader type catherine ohara gets to add her quirks as the overbearing mother and sam rockwell brings his usual brand of wackiness the first half of argylle works well as i was still piecing this all together director matthew vaughn lets his own ego get in the way in the second half which comes with one too many twists and a completely bonkers climax its almost as if he wanted to see how many surprises and reveals he could throw out some of them work but it often just meant additional shoot outs and action sequences which makes for a bloated runtime vaughn has a fun voice for the spy genre as weve seen with his kingsman movies and now argylle theres potential for this to be a franchise as argylle will certainly keep you guessing until the very end vaughn needs to remember that less is more in the meta approach he gave this film  aunjanue ellistaylor gives a deeply moving performance for the in origin which should not be missed writerdirector ava duvernay has frequently tackled the subjects of racism politics and the systems at play with films and series like selma 13th and when they see us now shes tackling the life of pulitzer prize winning author isabel wilkerson whose played by aunjanue ellistaylor duvernay sets her film in the backdrop of the murder of trayvon martin by george zimmerman isabel is approached to write about the murder but she feels conflicted as its not where she feels her career is at after writing her first book the warmth of other suns that won her the pulitzer she wants to have the answers and feel a part of the story instead of asking the questions within a short time she is faced with unimaginable grief after the death of two loved ones its a time when she feels like she has no one left in life and pours her grief into her work she starts to probe into the differences between racism and caste and the connection she finds between jim crow laws and nazi germany ava duvernay takes a unique approach in adapting wilkersons book caste which became a massive bestseller in 2020 after the death of george floyd this isnt a direct adaptation of the wilkersons concepts but rather takes us into the personal journey she had during this tumultuous time in her life this angle allows the audience to see inside the authors mindset when it seems like theres nothing left to offer the world and to then trying to understand something so monumental the first three quarters of the film dives into her research but duvernay knows the audience will have a greater impact by understanding the visuals as part of her history lesson she makes isabels research come alive as she takes the audience into nazi conference rooms concentration camps and life in india under their caste systems aunjanue ellistaylor commands the screen at every point giving isabel a hard outer shell despite that personal pain and heartbreak shes feeling in the inside  origin is reminder that no matter where we are at in life theres always room for growing and understanding this is a history lesson by way of one persons learning versus an academic history book approach mean girls became a cult classic after its release in 2004 it lead to a hit broadway musical that is currently being performed by high schools across the country the plastics are back at it as now its been adapted as a movie musical tina fey wrote the original film and is back again penning the screenplay for the new movie which takes the same plot and characters we love but places them in present day instead of 2004 angourie rice plays cady a new transplant to north shore high school after her mom moves them to the us from kenya cady makes friends with janice and damian theyre the two outcasts at school who introduce her to all the cliques at school one clique is the plastics three mean girls led by the queen bee regina george shes played by renee rapp who also played the part on broadway janice and damian convince cady to infiltrate the plastics and at the same time she starts to fall for aaron samuels who happens to be reginas ex there will be a lot of comparisons to the original film but directors samantha jayne and arturo perez jr and their cast have really tried to make this their own version of this story if you dont know the music you may find yourself grooving to the songs even if they seem a bit shortened than their original broadway versions they feel a bit tightened up much like i felt about the songs in the color purple samantha jayne and arturo perez jr treat the numbers like altered realities dream sequences like in chicago where the lighting dims and the ensemble comes alive in different ways tina feys script captures the snark she wrote in the first film plays with some of the iconic lines and uses social media as a big part of the story when that wasnt as prevalent back in 2004 theres a reginachallenge that goes viral mean girls is an entertaining pop movie musical that doesnt need the audience to have seen the original film or know the broadway musical to appreciate what this cast brings to the material the quirky characters and high school lessons should appeal to a new generation
Feb 3 2024,negative, argylle promised a slick quickwitted spy adventure helmed by henry cavills smooth operator to its audiences  but sadly that is not what it delivers despite a starstudded supporting cast featuring the likes of samuel l jackson john cena and dua lipa and filmmaker matthew vaughns own cat chip these are also things that the 200million 158m film fails to deliver vaughn has a lot of fans of his work in this genre thanks to the popularity of the kingsman franchise but its not a bar he reaches near with a stab at his own original story in argylle the concept has such promise with cavills agent argylle the fictional creation of introverted author elly conway bryce dallas howard whose uncanny knack for mirroring the actions of a reallife spy organisation in her books gets her into trouble in real life rescuing her and her cat alfie the aforementioned chip from a case of writers block and a train full of bad guys then kicks off a globetrotting adventure into a covert world where nothing and no one are what they seem however argylle has somewhat hoodwinked its expectant fan base with its cavillheavy marketing campaign as well as that argyleprinted cat backpack carrier they are determined will have its moment yes the superman star is in the film but its very much not his film hes a fictional creation that acts and speaks in the manner of meek homely ellys writing and yes its a clever idea but one vaughn could have and should have had a lot more fun with and with regards to the muchhyped nepo cat nothing is exciting there other than the distracting amount of time he spends in his carrier vaughn has utterly wasted the teased opportunity to deliver his cat character to feline fame and fortune there are other red herrings too with whos important in the cast as some actors are just rocking up for glorified cameos not necessarily a bad thing in dua lipas case im sorry to say samuel l jackson has played variations on his character here so many times its dizzying and certainly more famously in the marvel movies argylles leads are really howard and rockwell delivering a sort of watereddown version of romancing the stones odd couple pairing which was one of vaughns inspirations the actors themselves do a decent job with what theyre given  especially the everenjoyable rockwell  but its not a double act to rival the likes of michael douglas and kathleen turner a lot of this is down to vaughns overreliance on big stunt scenes and set pieces these are of course an integral part of the genre but its offputting overreliance on cgi enhancement is clear from just minutes in when dua lipa dashes down a windy road on a motorbike with uncanny ease there are some standout moments including an imaginative use of skating but theres also a lot of the same bullet spraying head kicking and legsplaying on the dancefloor throughout one bright spot is the welcome inclusion of catherine ohara as ellys mother ruth and bryan cranston as argylles baddie they both seem the most aware of the type of film theyre in amping it up to 11 at every opportunity ohara doesnt necessarily have the snappiest of dialogue a problem for all of them but she is determined youll chortle nonetheless in what is her action film debut it works as an entertaining piece of escapism but nothing beyond that with the way its been crafted the suggestion that this could be a fresh take on spy films is proven unfulfilled when argylle had the potential to do what it did much better if youve got a celebrity story video or pictures get in touch with the metrocouk entertainment team by emailing us celebtipsmetrocouk calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our submit stuff page  wed love to hear from you
Feb 3 2024,negative,its long loud lousy and brazenly absurd after a somewhat seductive start
Feb 3 2024,negative, looking back at all the marketing materials for argylle the very concept of the movie is a bait and switch rewind back to july 2021 when apple films first announced the movie the project was described as a novel that follows the exploits of a globetrotting superspy named argylle from a book written by ellie conway at the time director matthew vaughn claimed that this movie was going to reinvent the spy genre well argylle fails to do that on every level additionally argylle fails to exist as a halfwaydecent movie in dissecting that original story the whole concept of argylle as a movie and franchise is built around the author elly conway who is a character in the film the real author behind the books written for the film remains anonymous in the world of the motion picture writer elly conway portrayed by bryce dallas howard in the film is a worldrenowned author famous for writing a spy novel series based around its eponymous hero agent argylle cavill agent argylle is a character in a world within the world of the actual film elly conway is a fictional concoction probably built as part of a transmedia campaign to enable argylle to break into multiple markets an actual argylle novel about the character referenced in the film has been published its similar to literal books published by the fictional author richard castle from the abc television series castle  the film opens with conway touring her latest spy novel in the argylle series followed by an imaginary prologue depicting henry cavill as a 007wannabe looking utterly ridiculous with a flattop arnold schwarzenegger haircut together with his trusted partner wyatt cena they apprehend the terrorist lagrange dua lipa but they discover that their organization has gone rogue conway is a celebrated successful writer for her books and shes already hard at work on her next installment but as shes taking a road trip via train home to visit her mother ruth ohara to rework the final act she meets a scruffy passenger aidan rockwell who turns out to be a master spy rescuing conway from a group of vicious unruly thugs disguised as train riders the duo makes an epic escape it turns out that the fiction of conways novels becomes real and there is a rogue spy network out there with bad intentions aidan seeks ellys help to expose the directorate and its megalomaniacal leader ritter cranston unfortunately elly struggles as the fiction of the world she created starts blending with reality in more ways than one  from the top down argylle has an impressive cast but fuchs script is a badly cliched hackneyed mess vaughn fails to use his actors to the best of their exceptional talents the script is full of twists and turns but all the major plot twists are poorly executed and thought out none of them make any sense the portrayal of cranston as an unhinged villain and the head of a rogue spy network should be fun instead vaughn depicts cranston as a twodimensional uninteresting character bordering on selfparody sam rockwell valiantly tries to elevate the material with his unique charisma and dry delivery but his character must deliver copious amounts of banal exposition the most unfortunate aspect is that rockwell and howard share next to no chemistry as the films designated pairing both howard and rockwell are great actors and the movie significantly hinges on their two character arcs however they cant ignite the screen with what should be a compelling whirlwind romance  creating a story where an author becomes embroiled in a reallife crisis is not exactly a novel concept argylle fails to do anything new or different from that concept other than a parade of nonsensical plot twists that add little actual intrigue not to mention most of the plot twists play as ideas cut and pasted from more recent works  whats worse about argylle despite a reported budget of 200 million is that its look and visual style reek of cheapness every major action and set piece looks heavily layered under bad cgi and digital trickery not the least of which are multiple stunts involving alfie the cat portrayed partially by vaughns reallife pet feline chip alfie becomes an active player in the plot and action which means significant amounts of execrable computergenerated feline imagery vaughn has always had a penchant for going over the top with his action scenes and he does so again here the problem is that the two crazy synthetic action sequences that happen late in the film only add to its flaws the action scenes couldve been salvaged had they looked more authentic but they crush the immersion of the films hyperrealized world  combined with the fictionalized concept behind the premise the movie heavily pushes the new song by the beatles now and then and vaughn extensively and shoddily rehashes his previous work argylle symbolically encompasses what a movie built by ai and algorithms probably looks like a synthetic hodgepodge mess with zero charm or inner life however the most infuriating aspect of argylle is the ending sequence followed by a headscratching midcredit scene if the films goal was to push forth a new franchise or shared universe its one of the worst executed attempts in recent memory with a runtime of about two hours and twenty minutes argylle is little more than a synthetic bloated mess to steal a quote from

Feb 3 2024,negative, columbus ohio wsyx  if you want to chill out this weekend take some time to watch some movies hope madden and george wolf of maddwolf share what you can catch and make a day out of it 
Feb 3 2024,negative, its the meh films that baffle me matthew vaughns argylle is a meh film the film centers around elly bryce dallas howard an introverted author of spy novels centered around an agent named argylle henry caville whose books have somehow become so accurate that theyre now predicting global spy events this attracts the attention of just about well everyone and its only her and a spy named aidan sam rockwell who can possibly save her while everyone tries to get their hands on her next novel  to be completely fair there are some impressive action sequences to be found in argylle and theres an impressive ensemble waiting around for the film they likely thought they signed up for to actually manifest in addition to our leading trio familiar faces like catherine ohara samuel l jackson john cena and bryan cranston are all here and obviously game for a good time ohara is the films highlight ellys mom she captures a tone that i wish everyone else had followed an inspired performance lost in a sea of bloated nothingness  the script by jason fuchs is trying way too hard with relentless twists and turns along the way and doublecrosses galore lets just say that john wick isnt looking over his should worried about this cinematic drivel the film lasts at least 30 minutes longer than it needs to be though i suppose if youre going to make a megabudgeted film you probably have to show something big on that big screen  listen theres no denying that matthew vaughn is a talented director however argylle simply isnt a good film and its barely a competent one heres hoping that argylle is vaughns cinematic lowpoint and he can get back to making stylish substantial motion pictures that are actually fun to watch 
Feb 3 2024,positive, argylle is an amusing fishoutofwater picture in which a writers life starts to imitate her art when shes ensnared in one of her espionage stories whether comedic or dramatic spy movies always have the potential to be very entertaining theres usually a mystery element to engage audiences and captivating personalities to hold their attention the hero is often put in impossible life and death situations forced to find ingenious solutions to survive the villain has certain stereotypical traits and a tendency to be overconfident that theyll successfully execute their scheme theres also a fair amount of action spread throughout the narrative as the opposing sides repeatedly confront each other argylle has all these things and more as a novelist becomes unexpectedly entangled in an espionage venture elly conway bryce dallas howard is the popular author of a series of spy books featuring the title character argylle henry cavill shes in the midst of completing her next novel but has yet to figure out its ending on route to work it out with her supportive mother catherine ohara shes intercepted by reallife spy aidan wilde sam rockwell and a group of men trying to kill her after aidan rescues elly and her cat alfie he explains that her novels have uncannily mirrored actual events making her a priority target for a cloakanddagger agency very similar to the one featured in her books and the only way to stop them is to finish her story since 2014 director matthew vaughn has helmed the kingsman franchise releasing a new adventure featuring the gentlemanly spy organization every few years although this movie doesnt appear to have a direct connection to the series a link is revealed by the end of the film that said it does share in all the fun audiences have come to expect from these films including entertaining fight sequences humorous character encounters and multiple plot twists the result is a fastpaced fun movie that doesnt feel like 139 minutes because theres never a dull moment and all the reveals make sense within the narrative even if some viewers find them predictable the cast is also impeccable howard plays an intelligent woman and burgeoning cat lady who also happens to be too terrified to practice anything shes conceived for her books rockwell is the charming rougharoundtheedges knight in shining armor that rescues the damsel in distress while repeatedly convincing her to push through deathdefying situations meanwhile cavill plays the fictitious suave secret agent supported by john cena and ariana debose and theres several other notable cast members including bryan cranston dua lipa richard e grant and samuel l jackson whos roles are best discovered by watching alfie the cat plays prominently in the narrative but the movie really does belong to the wonderful humans who bring the story to life and ensure the time audiences spend in theatre is not wasted  copyright  1998  2023 digital journal inc sitemaps xml  news  digital journal is not responsible for the content of external sites read more about our external linking 
Feb 3 2024,positive, i could write a negative review of argylle if i wanted to i could criticize the overstuffed preposterous story and the central plot twist thats ripped off from other spy stories i could complain that the 139minute running time is too long i could rage against a nonsensical action scene where a character ice skates on oil a lot of things about this movie could be faulted theres just one problem doing any of that would betray the fun i had watching the movie elly conway bryce dallas howard is the author of a bestselling book series about a spy named argylle while on a train bound for chicago to see her mother catherine ohara she meets aidan wilde sam rockwell a reallife spy who informs her that shes in great danger ellys most recent book has eerily mirrored actual events involving a covert government organization called the division thats run by madman ritter bryan cranston they think she has inside information about a flash drive that could expose their evil deeds aidan attempts to help elly locate the drive before they do henry cavill portrays a vision of the fictional argylle she routinely sees during their adventures thats a plot synopsis it does nothing to convey the tone of argylle nothing is quite what it seems the screenplay by jason fuchs tosses in at least half a dozen plot developments that completely change the direction of the story crosses doublecrosses and triplecrosses abound action scenes find characters doing stuff that defies the laws of gravity and physics agent argylle pops in to give elly advice and reassurance when necessary in other words nothing about the movie is linear or logical and yet that quality is precisely what makes argylle entertaining the film gives itself permission to do literally anything then takes advantage of that permission by throwing one wild insane unpredictable element after another at the audience were in an age where few movies have originality everything is based on a previously existing property heres a picture that writes its own rules devising outlandish scenarios left and right i found that refreshing director matthew vaughn kingsman the secret service is known for big overthetop action fare he delivers violent mayhem with awesome visual style a fight on a train is partially filmed from the pov of elly as shes trapped in the narrow bathroom we only know whats happening based on who flies past the door at any given second a later sequence  which is the best thing ive seen onscreen so far this year  is a shootout amid beautiful plumes of brightlycolored smoke that ice skating bit well its stupid but the film is sufficiently committed to its own outrageousness that the idea takes on a giddy quality there are no boundaries allowing for the freedom to go anywhere lots of other disparate pleasures can additionally be found from pop singer dua lipa as a femme fatale to the comedic hijinks of ellys cat to the appealingly quirky performances from rockwell and howard argylle wont be for everyone in fact it may be for a very small subset of people im among them though if you have a taste for movies that go for broke you too might appreciate vaughns playfully gonzo spy adventure 
Feb 3 2024,negative, argyllenote the second l pleaseshould be investigated for creative embezzlement theres just no way a film this stacked with idiosyncratic talent sam rockwell catherine ohara bryan cranston richard e grant can be so relentlessly thuddingly punishingly devoid of even the most fleeting molecule of amusement unless its all a puton i thought of the way the producers in uh the producers created a musical called springtime for hitler in an unsuccessful attempt to lose eyewatering sums of money winking hard enough to give itself an aneurysm this tediously selfaware spy comedy comes to us from the twisted mind ofper the films marketing materialsmatthew vaughn a brit with more than a few good movies under his belt his directing debut the 2004 crime flick layer cake more or less got its star daniel craig the role that would take him from being famous in the uk to famous all over the world vaughn also made 2011s xmen first class a swinging 60sset prequel that remains one of the two or three best entries in that wildly uneven superhero franchise more recently hes translated the espionagethemed comicbook series kingsman into three films finding them to be the ideal platform for a shockandawe sensibility that still feltat least somewhatsurprising when the first entry came out in 2014  but now several lifetimes and 200 comicbook movies later that sensibility is as played out as the 1970s slow jams vaughn drops over his new films bloodless consequencefree action sequences whenever he wants to signal to us that hes doing all of this ironicallyits not that hes actually out of ideas hes just mocking how uninspired his comicbook flickspy flick contemporaries are give me the earnestness of an impossible mission any daytheyre not just exponentially more thrilling than vaughns sardonic nihilism theyre funnier too the most interesting thing about argylle is its marketing campaign vaughn and screenwriter jason fuchs are pretending that this is an adaptation of a preexisting and beloved spy novel series created and written by actual genuine real life person elly conway the story theyre selling in the movies press notes and on its promotional campaign is that in the course of adapting conways book they hit upon the metafictional delight of making conway herself a central character in the movie like how meryl streep played susan orlean in adaptation its much more likely elly conway is the pen name of an author they commissioned to write a single argylle tiein novel which was published last month as part of the campaign for the movie the conway of argyllethemovie is promoting the fourth book in her series though in our world you can only purchase and read one the washington posts sophia nguyen did the gumshoe work of demonstrating that the existence of waitress turned bestselling novelist elly conway is almost certainly all swiftian nonsense although whether the swift in question is jonathan b 1667 or taylor b 1989 remains unsettled regardless of whoor ifelly conway actually is her argylle avatar is bryce dallas howard who is as blameless for the dreadful results here as she was in those three jurassic world movies those were bad but not this bad her fictionalorishe literary creation agent argylle is henry cavill given an unflattering flattop and shorn of the considerable charm and comic timing he showed in guy ritchies underseen the man from uncle just to compare cheeky british spy flicks to cheeky british spy flicks  cavill has been in good movies and bad ones but rockwellplaying the actual spy who informs elly that her bestselling novels are close enough to reality to make an international terrorist cabal want to kill heris usually a more astute judge of material than this vaughn loves the device of having elly think shes watching cavill do some cool spy shit only to blink and realize its really rockwell handling the action hero derringdo its a cgrade gag the first time vaughn does it and it does not get funnier or cleverer with repetition  remember when samuel l jackson was one of the most exciting performers in cinema he shows up for a few minutes too presumably lured by the promise of yet another spymaster part that doesnt require him to act leave his home or stand up if you happen to recall that he played the villain in the franchisestarting kingsman the secret service youll also recall how much better he was in that than in this vaughns habit of recycling gags and action sequences not just from his soso kingsman films but within this one movie pads this turkey to an unconscionable 139 minutesonly 10 minutes shorter than 2001 a space odyssey for crying out loud vaughn could shave that by half an hour just by showing us all his digitally glazed slomo pursuits and fights sequences at regular speed  we dont have one readers like you keep our work free for everyone to read if you think that its important to have high quality local reporting we hope youll support our work with a monthly contribution
Feb 3 2024,negative,  about a third of the way through matthew vaughns latest film argylle theres a scene in which catherine ohara as ruth conway talks on the phone with her daughter the scene stands out not for any particulars of the performance but for the lighting until this moment every scene has been lit like a pharmaceutical commercial no moody shadows no shades beyond the queasily bright in this scene however as ruth speaks with her daughter theres a rectangular block of light on her torso blazing in from an unseen window this blownout bright spot wouldnt matter if it werent the only moment in the film to have a bit of reality creeping in still it stands out for seeming to be the only time something real is happening beyond the stifling construction of the films execution   argylle is vaughns latest candycoated foray into the world of doubleidentities double and triplecrosses spycraft and general james bondery territory that hes found ample material in  like a kid finding a forgotten tonka in a sandbox  with the three kingsman films that have trickled out of the past few years the secret service 2014 the golden circle 2017 and the kings man 2021 with their share of ecstatic highs and direst of lows this trio of films largely served as a remedy to the forlorn brutishness of daniel craigs bond films vaughn embraced the childish glee of remote bases gimmickbased villains and plenty of action free bird anyone which are envisioned with a contemporary lust for hyperviolence and executed with technical implementation that could not have occurred during sean connerys sevenfilm turn as 007   after an introductory action sequence argylle begins in earnest with elly conway bryce dallas howard the writer of middlegrade spy fiction sitting at a table in front of an adoring audience elly has just finished her latest book in her argylle series about the titular spy portrayed in liveaction sequences involving henry cavill and his sexy globetrotting adventures  stories that she finishes writing by literally saying the end note theres no sense that elly has an editor she simply finishes a novel and the world receives it one eager audience member puts ellys name in conversation with fleming forsyth and le carré a comparison that should irk just about anyone who has read any of the three authors works especially in the latter case but this is still just the beginning   aside from the films questionable sense of literary merit and the narrowminded conception of what an author actually does argylle happily plods along sometime later elly boards a train shes headed to her vacation home with cat alfie in tow who sits plainfaced within one of those backpacks with an observational bubble a minor flirtation with a passerby later elly finds herself facetoface with the scraggly aidan sam rockwell who looks like anything but henry cavill despite appearances aidan tells elly theyll have to square off against a litany of adversaries in a few moments elly understandably confused finds herself in a situation like in her books   its not long before its revealed not really a spoiler that ellys novels have a prescient quality making her a seer of particular interest to the division headed up by the cantankerous cutthroat ritter bryan cranston the division is after a damning piece of evidence that threatens the organizations very existence unfortunately for them along with aidan and elly the files exact contents and whereabouts are a mystery because the answer lies in a chapter that elly has not yet written   without ruining the reveals theres enough in the films latter half to explain why this particular setup was used if one got the sense that this was just the wishfulfillment fantasy of an author who is described as a cat lady then they should rest assured it absolutely is that but theres also a reason behind it the problem however is in how much one has to endure to get to the quadruplecrossing second half and whether theres a reason to care by then by the time the secrets roll in the film has already spent most of its good faith   on paper argylle has an intriguing setup still its the sort of story that stokes the flames of imagination best when it remains an elevator pitch  unfettered with the problem of having to bring its ideas to life in the hands of someone like say john le carré the story couldve bore the weight of its initial intrigue with a spinningplate precision that argylle sorely lacks  but le carré this is not   its easy to forget that vaughn now farflung from the orbit of guy ritchie on whose lock stock and two smoking barrels and snatch vaughn produced  and his own ritchielite layer cake  used to be the type of filmmaker whose popsavvy style seemed to built to navigate a range of styles after his directorial debut shook off the burden of influence vaughn became unpredictable   stardust 2007 based on neil gaimans novel of the same name was a beguiling winkwinking fantasy kickass 2010 based on john romita jr and mark millars comic universe was a brutal vigilante film scratching the rrated antihero itch before it was all anyone could talk about xmen first class 2011 benefitted from having a shiny yellow veneer capturing the tone of its comic book namesake and graciously offering a brooding michael fassbender performance as a nazihunting magneto and of course there are the kingsman films which above all else had an undeniable joy even if they sometimes felt too absurd to fully get on board with see lenin linking up with hitler   with a body of work as eclectic as vaughns one cant help but feel that argylle is the director operating in cruise mode settling into a tone that demands very little and offers even less sure theres the allure of sam rockwell reintroducing some of his charlies angels 2000 dance moves and theres a cat spoiler its cgi but youve seen better versions of everything in this film before  even in vaughns previous work and if thats not enough those other films didnt have the terribly unsettling feeling they were trying to get you to buy a beatles song on apple music  hazbin hotel has introduced a host of amazing new characters for fans to meet but from husk to vaggie who deserves more in season 2
Feb 3 2024,positive,the spy spoof argylle is consistently clever frequently funny and highly entertaining
