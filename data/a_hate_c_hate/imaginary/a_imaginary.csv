Apr 14 2024,negative,omg this was just awful beyond what words can piece together whoever gave this movie the green light should seriously consider another line of work
Apr 14 2024,positive,absolutely  fantastic and just the right amount of scary  for a teenager 13 and a 10 year old great story too we all loved  it 1010
Apr 14 2024,positive,i really enjoyed it alote to me it was more r then pg13 and gave me conjuring vibes if god does get me to buy this i would definitely buy it but it was still a little unholy i just think it underrated
Apr 14 2024,negative,it was okay in the first halfish me and my friend jumped at one or two little scares but in the second half stuff got real goofy lmao the worldbuilding was ass and it was really funny when the old lady died cause the bear paw was so clearly a cheap prop and a cheap cliche death old ladys acting sucked too my friend and i and the couple in the back of the theater were laughing so hard it was so awful  two stars because sometimes a shitty horror movie can be fun to laugh at lol
Apr 14 2024,negative,the movie was horrible but in amidly hilarious way its entertainment i guess
Apr 14 2024,negative,acting was atrocious characters that were introduced that had zero impact on the story whatsoever the villain or antagonist of the story seemed to continually change was it chauncey  was it this entity that is connected to everyones imaginary  it was a bit confusing but overall mediocre at best
Apr 13 2024,negative,imaginary had a lot of potential even though that dumb bear was named chauncey imagine a movie that got scarier as it wentthats not this movie
Apr 13 2024,neutral,its decent i thought the story was pretty engaging but the ending was missing something for me didnt like how it was executed i thought it was kind of weird
Apr 12 2024,negative,i couldnt see anything during the lowlight parts of the movie so i turned it off after 20 minutes
Apr 12 2024,neutral,this might not be the bonechilling horror some critics are slamming it for but it delivers a campy creaturefeature charm that scratches a specific itch heres the thing if you go in expecting a modern annabelle or m3gan youll likely be disappointed but if you approach it with the mindset of a 90s goosebumps episode aimed at a slightly older audience then imaginary becomes a surprisingly fun ride    the plot is familiar a young girl befriends a creepycute stuffed bear named chauncey and things take a turn for the weird the scares are more jump scares and spooky atmosphere than genuine dread but theres a certain enjoyment in the cheese factor a winkwink nudgenudge to classic horror tropes    heres the comparison to goosebumps imaginary has that same blend of childish scares and genuine creepiness it wont terrify you but it might make you look twice at your own childhood toys  and isnt that part of the fun
Apr 12 2024,positive,enjoyed it not super scary but definitely family friendly my teens enjoyed it
Apr 10 2024,negative,there are plenty of movies featuring a family moving into a large home being affected by a paranormal occurrence a child is usually the affected party followed by an introduction to a psychiatrist psychic or knowledgeable 3rd party who quickly explains what ghost or demon is the culprit we then have parents who slowly learn the threat is real toss in some plot armor and end with the entity supposedly being extinguished and the house being destroyed other similar movies sinister poltergeist annabelle boogeyman etc at the end of the day you have another generic movie with a paranormal threat thats usually some ancient evil awakened to terrorize a small suburban family
Apr 10 2024,positive,the movie was ok i liked the plot twist and some of the classic practical effects some of the acting was not so good too really bad not something i would watch again
Apr 9 2024,positive,the pace was perfect and the anticipatory story kept you guessing
Apr 8 2024,positive,honestly i dont get why everyone is hating people who are hating must like the typical movie where they trip on air and end up dying this movie was unpredictable and infact did not still from the movie m3gan the plot was entirely different from m3gan and had huge orginality although the movie wasnt as scary as chucky or m3gan it definitely was the type of movie that u cant look at since ur afraid and notice how the people who are hating literaly have the most trashiest reasons to not like the movie everyone is focusing on a specific scene that had a flaw in it and decided to hate the entire movie because of it i also hate they compare m3gan to imaginary they are not in common the plots are entirely different although i think this movie couldve had more money and effort added towards it haters need to hop off this movie cause you all have trashy reasons to hate it i saw a comment that said imagine something better go imagine ur dadanyways i rate this movie a 910
Apr 7 2024,negative,family friendly horror movie with gooey soft ending  no real sense of danger or evil lurking only plus good to see betty buckley she awesome in as gym coach in carrie
Apr 6 2024,negative,this is the worst movie of the year for me  the script was horrible and the acting was just as bad if not worse  i cant imagine how anyone could read this script and think to green light it  definitely ruined my friday night
Apr 6 2024,positive,i mean i didnt hate it but considering the fact that it was made by the some director that made the five nights at freddys movie i was excited to see i did feel like it was just a little too predictable the acting was pretty good though and i did like the premise of the story i dont know if this was an original idea and it just wasnt executed that well or if this is from a novel and it wasnt executed that well just dont overhype yourself up going into this movie like i did
Apr 6 2024,neutral,imaginary is another bland and generic pg 13 horror movie while the cast does a decent job and theres a decent twist thrown in here it still doesnt do enough to stand out its an okay movie though i suppose so maybe check it out if you are really intrigued
Apr 5 2024,positive,very good scary movie
Apr 5 2024,negative,it started off okay but then just got dumb at the end i had high expectations for blumhouse as i always do but this missed the mark completely
Apr 4 2024,positive,i really enjoyed the movie it was fun had some scares and the story was intense i dont understand all the hate the horror characters were a little goofy tho
Apr 4 2024,negative,blumhouse with another huge miss
Apr 3 2024,positive,i enjoyed this movie had some lessons even though it wasnt too scary i think the overall theme of the movie was good i was fond of the world that the film introduced the audience with whoever made the chauncey song needs a raise
Apr 3 2024,negative,seemed like a good horror movie up until the last 45 min seemed like they didnt know how to finish it off and they just threw it together and put it out in theaters the book the step mom in the movie  wrote was probably better written than this movie 2510
Apr 3 2024,negative,this movie totally sucks in so many ways the acting from everyone is super whack anything thats supposed to be scary is ridiculous 
Apr 3 2024,negative,it was ok needs more scares
Apr 3 2024,positive,i dont know why a lot of people were saying negative things about this movie it was very enjoyable to my kids and i it was scary funny and suspenseful i dont take movies like this so serious just lay back and have fun with it id definitely say if you want to experience it in theatres do it
Apr 3 2024,positive,imaginary is another big miss from blumhouse  its basically a mixture of insidious and poltergeist rolled into one and it doesnt work     the cast do their best especially with what they were given the dialogue doesnt work and its not scary enough to call it a good horror movie     i know i was late to watching it but it just didnt work its the same generic formula that weve seen a million times before and the ending sets up a sequel but i think they should just leave it     35
Apr 3 2024,positive,this movie is very good i recommend watching it in a smaller room with less people this movie had a great story the many plot twists were great it all made sense and it was great definitely one that id recommend
Apr 2 2024,neutral,another mid movie by blumhouse the only remotely disturbing thing about this movie is the weird big bear that looks like a mix of an actual guy in a suit  some cgi
Apr 2 2024,negative,this is a worst horror movie of all time in 2024 
Apr 2 2024,negative,i really wanted to like this movie but they made it so hard to the concept of this film had me really excited i even enjoyed the lore they introduced in the film about the imaginary friends ive really been struggling to find things i liked about this film visually the film looked great and for the most part the acting was fine with standout performances by dewanda wise pyper braun and of course the legendary betty buckley besides that the film felt very hollow they could have done so much with this concept
Apr 2 2024,negative,imaginary is a flawed film that has so much potential in its ideas from the start the ambition was there but after all the story turned into a convoluted and rather annoying the ideas for an imagination based horror movies were endless but their execution was awful however the film is so bad it enters the so bad its good territory for me i had a good time with the film personally the film also isnt a horror film but rather a suspenseful film with unsettling imagery overall a flawed film with lost potential
Apr 2 2024,positive,overall i thought it was a fun film i absolutely love the practical effects probably the biggest selling point for me a lot of the jumpscares are predictable but that didnt really bother me since most horror movies nowadays are extremely formulaic i do hope this gets an over the top sequel that takes place primarily neverever
Apr 2 2024,negative,it was terrible acting was bad story is all over the place the premise of an imaginary friend could have been so much better blumhouse needs to be a little more careful on what movies to stand behind ugh
Apr 2 2024,negative,absolutely dreadful the plot had no purpose and made very little sense i was looking forward to the movie that changed quickly once the movie began
Apr 1 2024,negative,i feel like i have seen this move already its exactly like boogeyman from 2023
Apr 1 2024,positive,honestly it was a bit cheesy but it had my full attention the whole movie
Apr 1 2024,positive,my bf and i thought it was really good we hope it comes out with a part 2 to tell the little boys story
Apr 1 2024,neutral,first 80 of the movie was actually pretty good some scenes you knew what was next as to the general feeling of this movie other times some single one liners came across as a bit much in the face of acting wouldnt happen in real life i told my wife in the beginning of this movie it would quickly get worse as soon as they showed the entity monster in this case and it held very true it was almost humorous not a bad watch for  home but i wouldnt have spent the coin to take the family at the movies
Apr 1 2024,positive,started slow but ended good very good and very creatively freaky
Mar 31 2024,positive,when i watch the trailers  for upcoming horror movies  my expectations arent very high with that being said  it was pretty good i liked it
Mar 31 2024,negative,omg the worst horror movie of 2024 so far bad acting horrible villain bad plot twist the characters were not good   its just bad
Mar 31 2024,negative,most pointless movie of   the year so far
Mar 31 2024,positive,i saw this movie on march 30th 2024 and as a girl who once had an imaginary friend who oddly enough was a teddy bear i fount this phscopathic monster amusing i love the slow burn of this movie i will say i have alot of biases towards to concept but my sister who is more into the gore and shock horror still loved this movie we saw it in the same cinema at the same time at the same place
Mar 31 2024,positive,i really appreciated that it relied more heavily on the psychological buildup and less on cheap jump scares
Mar 31 2024,neutral,the cast and premise looked promising but the  bad acting editing pacing nonsensical storyplot terrible music score and overall end product gutted what could have been a great film
Mar 30 2024,negative,its annoying that they have to explain everything while its so obvious with imagination you could defeat it but they dont really use it it makes no sense  waste of time
Mar 30 2024,negative,also with a lot of benevolence boring tiring and not the least bit entertaining
Mar 30 2024,positive,the movie started a little slow but picked up and was intense i loved the premise of the movie this is one that id love to own
Mar 30 2024,negative,it was good until the complete foolish twist
Mar 30 2024,positive,this movie was so good i dont know why people hate but i want a sequel chauncey coming back at the end and his monstrous look plus the creepy music
Mar 30 2024,negative,the start off was good and certain parts of the film were really good and the concept was really good but the way they delivered in the film was just terrible and unfortunately a movie that with a good concept that could have been good turned into a mess of a movie and slowly just got worse and worse as the film went on
Mar 30 2024,positive,in a time where everything is a remake or based on a book i have to say i really appreciated the originality of the storyline it was entertaining and unpredictable allaround pyper braun does a great job in her role and its filled with surprises i will be watching it again when its released 
Mar 30 2024,negative,this film seems to take an aim at childhood trauma and how it carries through your life the protagonists never reach a conclusion you would think it would end with it facing her fear and overcoming her past trauma the ending almost leaves it open for a part two that should never be considered however the acting was okay and it did not become intolerable until the last 15 minutes of the movie
Mar 30 2024,negative,just bad started off okay and just spiraled
Mar 30 2024,positive,a alright movie that did some well and some bad but i do like a idea and villain design
Mar 29 2024,positive,i really liked it a little confusing at the end but overall pretty good hope they make a next movie showing them going to destroy the bear so it never harms anyone again
Mar 29 2024,positive,maybe im not enough of a horror fan because while i agree this wasnt particularly scary im fine with that the family issues offset the surrealism nicely for better or worse this is one of the few films i have watched a trailer of seen all the way though and then thought this is exactly what was advertised     pretty formulaic but what isnt these days    nothing about this movie makes want to watch it a second time but it was interesting enough to watch the whole way though which is more than i can say for some films
Mar 28 2024,negative,this is probably better suited to tweens and teens its not scary at all its goofy and reminds me of the are you afraid of the dark series on nickelodeon campy if anything
Mar 28 2024,negative,movie was slow and boring
Mar 28 2024,positive,not sure why there were so many bad reviews  i thought it was great  any flick that delivers things you could potentially miss such as quick flashes of something lurking in the background is exactly the sauce i would deliver if i had the means to make a horror  it encourages another viewing or finger on the rewind button  it wasnt overly scary nobut it was creative with a nice twist or two  i wouldnt have been disappointed seeing it in the theater
Mar 28 2024,negative,this film ripps off poppy playtime and fnaf
Mar 28 2024,positive,imaginary had the beginnings of a good concept let down by poorly explored back stories and several plot holes that said there were enough jumpy moments to keep us entertained and the young actress was very good my daughter enjoyed it in fact at certificate 15 it may have in fact censored itself from an ideal younger audience that would have probably made it a hit
Mar 28 2024,neutral,a few jumps and scares but not up to the usual bh and lionsgate standards for horror but for 2499 instead of a 1999 rental i now own this so theres that
Mar 27 2024,positive,it was an ok movie kind of predictable and not really built up to anything great i would say its a great scary movie for kids 12 and younger
Mar 27 2024,negative,one of the worst movies ive ever seen i cant believe blumhouse put their name on this
Mar 27 2024,positive,it was pretty good boring at some parts but besides that it was good
Mar 27 2024,negative,lack of horror films dialogues and acting lead you out of the vibes and the story overacting for a nice idea it feels like a parody or a scarymovie where the cuts are to strong from a logic dialogue and sequence
Mar 27 2024,negative,could be better the imaginary world doesnt work for me
Mar 27 2024,positive,generic yet entertaining imaginarys interesting ideas nice practical effects and cool villain make it a decent movie that couldve been really better had it been given the proper script
Mar 27 2024,negative,absolutly horrible movie i can not begiin to explain how trash this stinky movie was this movie was worse than a dhar man video i dont even know why i continuted to watch it because it was to trash absolutly no horror in this movie plot was disgraceful absouty disgracefull if i ever see anything about this movie i will literally throw my phone in the ocean do not watch this movie
Mar 27 2024,negative,imaginary is a passable horror which falters in execution of its interesting ideas
Mar 27 2024,neutral,edge of your seat jump scare filled film a basic physiology film with the effort of horror injected in the plot not a bad movie to kill time with or to actually enjoy ill leave that up to you the viewer 
Mar 27 2024,positive,better than i thought im not sure about the pg13 rate thoughit could be an r
Mar 27 2024,positive,from the very beginning imaginary 2024 grabs your attention with its intriguing concepts and mesmerizing effects the narrative takes you on a journey through uncharted territories of imagination exploring realms that defy logic and challenge conventional storytelling sure it may not be hailed as the most innovative piece of cinema but it doesnt need to be  what it offers is a refreshing take on familiar themes sprinkled with enough originality to keep you hooked  imaginary 2024 has gotten some hate but i really enjoyed it  its not the most original movie but its definitely interesting the way it mixes real life with imagination kept me entertained  and visually its awesome the special effects are really cool and make the movie feel like a wild ride  overall imaginary 2024 might not be everyones cup of tea but if youre up for a fun and imaginative journey give it a shot
Mar 27 2024,negative,dont waste your time or money i had more fun going to the gas station
Mar 27 2024,negative,absolutely terrible poor acting soo so cheesy
Mar 27 2024,negative,i liked blumhouses nightswim watched it twice and megan was fun but the studio is really ripping off movie goers now with movies like imaginary this is a bottom of the barrel movie it probably could have been made for a few thousand bucks as its full of unknown or budget actors and its mostly filmed in a house i know blumhouse makes cheap horror but this is a very low budget film with a desperate ridiculous premise they try to sell the only person who might enjoy this movie is someone who just crawled out from under a rock and is watching a horror movie for the first time
Mar 27 2024,neutral,blumhouse is going to blumhouse they come up with a interesting movie idea but they execute it poorly this movie isnt one of blumhouses worst movies but it certainly isnt one of their best its mediocre and generic
Mar 26 2024,negative,honestly the worst movie i have ever watchedspeachless
Mar 26 2024,positive,i loved it the theme was a learning experience i would invite my grandchildren to watch it
Mar 26 2024,positive,imaginary offers a mix of elements that keep the audience engaged from good scares to a unique twist albeit a bit cliché the combination of these factors seems to create an enjoyable and captivating experience for viewers
Mar 26 2024,positive,it was a great movie it was corny in the middle but it pulled through towards the ending
Mar 26 2024,positive,i enjoyed this movie had a nice twist to it
Mar 26 2024,positive,our entire group found imaginary to be a delightful experienceespecially from the horror genre  the movie had just the right amount of jump scares humor excellent performances by the cast and a well conceived and original plot  we loved it
Mar 26 2024,negative,it was a good concept not so good execution couple of jump scares thats about it
Mar 25 2024,positive,this movie slapped liam had me gigglinggg and chauncy killed those hoes slayfully 65 stars 
Mar 25 2024,positive,another great film by blumhouse lots of scary scenes and jumps more of an original story with some notable twists very entertaining
Mar 25 2024,negative,i want a refund  confusing plot corny effects and no resolution
Mar 25 2024,negative,this movie was a chore to sit through only one death in the whole movie and it happens offscreen behind a closed door a main cast member just goes away mid movie and is never mentioned or seen again the only scary moment is a jump scare toward the beginning of them movie this movie kinda felt like blumhouse had a leftover five nights at freddies costume and let a drunken chimp write a script to use it this movie was such a pain to sit through that at the first false ending the line the end of one story is the beginning of another i literally shouted in the theater please dont tell it ive eaten taco bell and been more terrified going to the bathroom than i was while watching this dud of a movie
Mar 25 2024,neutral,better than blumhouses first of the year night swim imaginary almost feels like it couldve been way better the production design on this went insane the one gory kill was great and the premise itself is also pretty good but this lacked with a pg13 rating the pacing in this is offbeat some of the writing was just not good and some creative decisions yeah not horrific this has some good moments but its very minimal definitely dug the coraline vibe though
Mar 25 2024,positive,ok hear me out going into this movie i was nervous that it wouldnt be a fun watch and i would be miserable watching this in the first 20 minutes or so yeah i was kinda i thought the acting was questionable the plot layout was weird and the effects of the bear was cw quality however by the middle of this movie my mind changed the plot layout was to me unique laying out a new kinda way of portraying a horror movie it had a ton of twist and turns and to me the imaginary worlds never evers cg and set was awesome as hell it scared me geniunely a couple of times without any blood guts or cheap scares there was a jumpscare which felt cheap in the beginning the second half scared me with none of that the practical effects were cool as hell especially when she started sinking through the paper floor slowly and the main characters struggles the acting was definitely stepped up everyone who hates on this movie all thry can say is its not as bad as night swim which i did not see because even the premise i thought was terrible however it is probably better than most of the new horror movies coming out lately better than knock at the cabin by far better than the boogeyman from stephen king even better than five nights at freddys which hurts because thats my childhood he had unique quality and plays into making you think your right about it being trash before in the middle flipping everything you thought and expected on its head yeah some of the plotting is eh but if thats not good cinema i dont know what is it left me surprised and entertained thats the most that matters
Mar 24 2024,negative,trailer was scarier than the movie lots of plot issues
Mar 24 2024,positive,its got a really interesting story and characters   i like the fact that the bear was also not real because it made me question everything   i really like when they go in the the door of imagination but i think it couldnt of been scarier because it only made me jump a little and a little uncomfortable but it wasnt scary in the sense of it was hard to weached which was kinda of what i was expecting
Mar 24 2024,neutral,great concept but not well executed wish they wouldve done more with the camera work with the never ever and went into the girls past with their bio mom
Mar 24 2024,positive,i went to see this movie with my daughter and both found it very entertaining the jump scares were excellent and better in a nice loud theater my only complaint would be the special effects and the scary creatures could have looked a little more realistic but my fiveyearold loves creepy things and i think she could handle this one which is excellent both my daughters now want a plush chauncey lol i would see it again and i cant wait till it is on streaming to watch with my whole family fingers crossed they make a sequel
Mar 24 2024,positive,too much story too little scares still great
Mar 24 2024,neutral,neat concept with some great potential but fell short it will keep you entertained and wanting more but never really fills those needs fully worth a watch if you like fun but cheesy horror
Mar 24 2024,positive,it was good didnt expect that from a pg13 movie jump scare dropped my popcorn
Mar 24 2024,negative,heavily mediocre and all the fun was in the trailer there definitely could have been more imagination put into the script and direction of the film     overall id give this a 410
Mar 24 2024,positive,it held my attention  it was unique  great acting great horror movie
Mar 23 2024,positive,good movie to pass the time
Mar 23 2024,negative,imaginary wasnt good and very dragged out and confusing
Mar 23 2024,positive,this was a good midday flick both in terms of the story and the performances it feels like some parts of the narrative were left on the cutting room floor and several minor character actors give fair performances with dialogue that feels like weve seen and heard it before yet the core concept and compelling performances of other actors give plenty of moments to make you believe in the imaginary yeah sounds like a pr person wrote that but its really me who saw the movie on saturday for 10 if you dont see it in theaters youll still feel satisfied watching it when it comes to one of those red boxes or hits a streaming service 
Mar 23 2024,positive,interesting plot more of a fantasy scifi genre i liked this movie 
Mar 23 2024,positive,i personally really liked the film i understand that it may not appeal to those looking for heavier horror but the film is good within its limitations
Mar 23 2024,positive,i thought it would be just like any other horror movie but it wasnt i am normally one who can detect plot twists and easily tell how a story will go but the two major plot twists in this movie really caught me off guard i was so amazed by them that i knew i was gonna rate this movie 5 stars i enjoyed the acting and over all creativity of this movie this is not just like any other horror movie it is definitely worth the watch
Mar 23 2024,neutral,a decent premise that didnt deliver on the scares  theres a bit of world building that is appreciated but its difficult not to chuckle every time the monster of the film comes on screen  theres a few twists and turns along the way but none of them are particularly unpredictable
Mar 23 2024,positive,loved this movie  good jump scares good twists
Mar 23 2024,positive,ngl theis movie was amazing some might say its to slow but idc it is still cool
Mar 22 2024,positive,the popcorn had a lot of butter would definitely recommend
Mar 22 2024,positive,major plot holes really good until the last 2030 minutes
Mar 22 2024,positive,it wasnt amazing but it wasnt terrible either somewhere in the middle the first portion of the movie was good but the climax was a bit underwhelming for my taste
Mar 22 2024,negative,yeaaaaa mf that what you get your freaking producer of m3gan stupit producers thats karma for ruineing the fnaf movie
Mar 21 2024,positive,decent movie the bear was pretty creepy not gonna lie i wish that they wouldve followed through with the jump scares and not just cut the scenes the deeper meaning behind it all made the movie a little scarycreepy but if you are looking for something that is visually scary this isnt it
Mar 21 2024,positive,the movie feels really flat but starts getting better getting close to the final act its not terrible but definitely worth a watch
Mar 21 2024,negative,this movie is a nightmare for a 2yearold child give me my money back an interesting idea with a terrible pitch
Mar 21 2024,positive,it was pretty good concept and the build ups were great
Mar 21 2024,positive,for a scary movie nowadays it was pretty good most scary movies suck so much now but this one wasnt too bad it wasnt scary but it was definitely good the editing  wasnt dumb like most movies when they add in a bunch of close up scenes that look dumb if you like scary movies that arent scary but have a great story then this is great for you although the whole concept was lost like others were saying   very interesting and not what u would expect but definitely a cool movie 
Mar 21 2024,positive,it was good worth the watch
Mar 20 2024,negative,honestly save your money and dont waste your time wait for it to come out on a streaming platform this movie was so boring
Mar 20 2024,negative,this review was the worst movie that i have ever seen and i go to the movies often the storyline made no sense and the acting was even worse this isnt even worth seeing at home for free
Mar 20 2024,positive,what i like about it is that it had many twist and turns throughout the story but i feel like they could have done a little bit more with the scares they played it tuesday
Mar 20 2024,negative,after seing the trailer i thought it was weirdbut the concept was actually coolin the opposite
Mar 20 2024,positive,good horror movie to watch with the kids
Mar 20 2024,neutral,this movie was hyped gave a few good scares
Mar 20 2024,positive,had me screaming and laughing really got psycological
Mar 20 2024,negative,i want my money back
Mar 20 2024,positive,i liked the twist to the movie
Mar 20 2024,positive,it was a new concept and its a switch from the same old movies
Mar 20 2024,neutral,i enjoyed the cast i didnt like the story all too well so many questions left unanswered leaving the movie room to twist anyway it that allowed a lot less thinking going into the writing of the script
Mar 19 2024,positive,good idea the actors are all very good especially the main dewanda wise a few solid scary moments i was invested in their fates overall fun watch nothing amazing but definitely not bad or the worst worth the 1hr30min
Mar 19 2024,negative,probably the worst horror movie ive seen this year so far so cheesy and not scary in the slightest would not call it a horror film at all for any horror fans like me dont even bother to waste your time
Mar 19 2024,positive,great movie fool me on what i thought was the and it wasnt
Mar 19 2024,negative,overall the concept of the film is good however much of the concept gets lost in the predictably of the executed product a lot of the twists are seen a mile a way along with this the trailer from the movie provides the same concept of the whole movie i will say that the performances from the actors and actresses was okay but it does get bogged down by poor story direction and poor dialogue between characters the special effects were below average and overall seemed like an afterthought in production the use of costumes instead of some cgi also made the film seem outdated at times along with this some scenes were dragged out and others way too short it seemed like directors seemed way to focused on world building rather then executing a good story if you see this dont go in with high hopes
Mar 19 2024,positive,i really enjoyed it there was a great story perfect pacing and great characters
Mar 19 2024,negative,not as scary as i thought itd be
Mar 18 2024,negative,hands down the worst movie of 2024 so far
Mar 18 2024,negative,one of the worst thing ive ever seen im feel sorry for the actors that had to go though the whole thing  everything was so obvious and bad scripted so slow on every aspect a pain to watch horrible colors and bad actors choice overall the father of alice had like ten years more than the actual daughter  i wish i didnt spend my money on this and i advise you dont spend yours
Mar 18 2024,positive,wasnt what i was expecting left you with alot of questions
Mar 18 2024,negative,the storyline had so much potential but it ultimately fell flat poor writing and acting didnt feel any connection to the characters a few very obvious plot holes that distracted you from the film a couple good jump scares but would not see this again and dont recommend
Mar 18 2024,positive,the plot was slow not a horrible film just a little confusing and drawn out the ending was off in my opinion
Mar 18 2024,positive,didnt love the end but liked the beginning and was scary 
Mar 18 2024,negative,kids wouldnt stop being loud and obnoxious to even hear and enjoy the movie got stuff thrown and others were very mad
Mar 18 2024,negative,there were some good scares and the first plot twist was good but overall the movie doesnt feel fulfilling theres something missing they also didnt know when to end it
Mar 18 2024,negative,this has to the worst horror in 2024 like the scenes wasnt even hitting like there was no jump scared the story at the end was this trash i give it a rating 0210
Mar 18 2024,positive,i like it a lot i do recommend it
Mar 18 2024,neutral,its okay just a tad bit boring and predictable the plot twist didnt hit as hard as i would have hoped and the switch of one of the characters was pretty much guaranteed also the characters were very surface level i did not feel any emotion towards them and they were just very meh
Mar 18 2024,negative,just bad though i did laugh out loud not what was intended im sure
Mar 18 2024,negative,hands down the worst movie ive ever seen in a theatre    no redeeming qualities not creepy not frightening not scary not interesting not well written or ironically imaginative    some of the actors do well with the little they are given to work with thats the best i can say
Mar 18 2024,negative,dewanda wise tries very hard but this movie falls a little flat and long story short theres not even a need for the teddy bear i love the lead actress in other projects and hoped this wouldve been better than it is
Mar 18 2024,positive,i thought it was super cute and a fun movie
Mar 17 2024,negative,it was cringe looks like a bootleg version of cocaine bear
Mar 17 2024,positive,i havent seen such a good horror movie in a long time this movie was very well executed with a very good script and an incredible plot
Mar 17 2024,neutral,it had some good jump scare but the narrative could have been better
Mar 17 2024,negative,a potentially good idea that falls flat due to lack of imagination  the film is technically sound it looks good on the big screen it has a polished look and the film is edited well  that being said the movie started with an awesome horror sequence that captivated but unfortunately the remainder of the story drags throughout the majority of the film until you hit the last act the pacing is terrible and weighs the movie down heavily  aside from the pacing the story becomes rather predictable and lazy and loses any mystique it had going for it youre left with too many questions left unanswered when the credits roll  the characters were simple uninteresting and underdeveloped the cast at least did a good job with the underwhelming characters that were created we spend very little time exploring the antagonist which is the most interesting aspect of this entire movie i still dont quite understand how the monster operates   theres no blood or gore in this one to save it from mediocrity its unfortunate because this movie started off rather scary but that quickly dwindled as the movie progressed the action picks up in the third act where we get more horror sequences that work and are effective the creature designs were neat and we needed to see more of that on screen this is where to movie shined and actually worked  what a disappointment i was not expecting anything grandiose but at least something entertaining the bear gimmick is short lived and not enough was done to properly and coherently expand this monster and how it works and lives this movie would have worked better in a short format at least the idea would  have been more focused
Mar 17 2024,negative,bland unflavorful  cliche
Mar 17 2024,positive,the movie was very suspenseful not many jump scares but lots of anticipation the acting was great from all the actors and actresses the only thing that i was disappointed was the actual monsters on the climax of the movie they werent scary enough once you saw them in its entirety but the actors expression towards them made them scarier than what they actually were again the actors were so convincing you felt the emotion they were portraying great for people who are starting to get into scary movies
Mar 17 2024,negative,there was a fight in the theatre that was more entertaining than this movie
Mar 17 2024,positive,good plot line and resolution
Mar 17 2024,positive,its a combination about some movies of horror while it trys to make a good story and it is cause it has some interesting elements and characters that make it great but some horror scenes doesnt help to much about it
Mar 17 2024,negative,even though the film has some well acted and even kind of disturbing moments that just makes it even more infuriating when the rest of it is just so clichéd jump scare heavy and stupid it had so much potential and the majority of it feels wasted
Mar 17 2024,negative,while the movie isnt 100 horrid it certainly was not good while it did have its moments and there was a good twist it suffers from annoying characters confusing and just plain bad writing and a villain that didnt come off as scary and was more goofy
Mar 17 2024,negative,i wish i had never watched this    the idea for the movie itself was interesting but i dont think they played it out well at all not to mention the acting itself was shocking and not in a good way
Mar 17 2024,neutral,was not scary and the plot could have been much more developed
Mar 17 2024,negative,this is your standard formulaic horror film  they stick to the formula because it works  its cheesy and relies mainly on jump scares  there are some moments of unsettling tension throughout  acting is okay but dialogue is flat and predictable  they spoon feed the lore to you which always comes across as forced  the movie is fine if youre looking for your standard horror movie experience  dont expect anything more from this one
Mar 17 2024,positive,i enjoyed the suspense but would have like them to more explaining on the mother and the old lady neighbor
Mar 17 2024,positive,it was fun not everything has to be some magnum opus just a fun weekend horror flick
Mar 17 2024,positive, lot of people are hating on it but it really isnt that bad its entertaining and different it is a bit cheezy at times but also have some creepy points to it and one of the jumpscares actually made me jump it couldve been better bit id say 710
Mar 17 2024,positive,i loved it the drugs i was on made it amazing if i was not on drugs i wouldve walked out
Mar 17 2024,positive,it was amazing me and my husband loved it for date night it wasnt scary scary but definitely something different to watch hope you all enjoy it like we did 
Mar 17 2024,negative,this was the worst movie i have ever seen how is it even possible for it to get funding
Mar 17 2024,negative,the movie was pretty bad was on my phone half of the time
Mar 17 2024,negative,decent concept but a poorlyacted snooze fest with unearned sequel baiting wont watch again
Mar 17 2024,negative, girl please lol
Mar 17 2024,positive,this movie was so funny u guys have to see it with friends i didnt see anything wrong with this movie
Mar 17 2024,negative,very boring and actually pretty stupid movie
Mar 16 2024,positive,this was a good movie hopefully there will be a sequel soon
Mar 16 2024,positive,this movie was really good i liked the acting in it especially the girl who played alice i hope they make a sequel too imaginary if they do i will see it
Mar 16 2024,positive,blumhouses imaginary turned out to be an okay horror movie i definitely didnt find the movie to be great nor did i find it to be terrible the biggest flaw i personally have with imaginary is the pacing some scenes did feel pretty slow and i feel like they sometimes go on for too long the story although decently written can actually be quite predictable at many points the movie does have its scary moments  jump scares but only one or maybe two i actually did find were somewhat effective and even caught me off guard at one point moving on to the positives imaginary has a really cool concept and it actually is pretty creative  the cinematography is also great along with some cool visual effects great acting was also present throughout the movie especially with dewanda wise as jessica taegen burns as taylor  of course pyper braun as alice the movie also packs a surprisingly interesting plot twist which i wont discuss for spoiler reasons overall blumhouses imaginary is an okay horror movie that definitely couldve been a lot better but also couldve been much worse for me as for my rating im going to rate imaginary a 610
Mar 16 2024,positive,i mean it sucked but it was fun
Mar 16 2024,positive,i was really excited to see this movie and it didnt disappoint in a way the final product was something i dont recommend watching in theaters but definitely something to watch with friends at your house in the dark the premise is really good i just wish they went a more darker and scarier way with it but overall a great watch
Mar 16 2024,positive,very captivating and suspensefulteenagers loved it too
Mar 16 2024,positive,took my 9 year old daughter to see it and she liked it there were a couple boys her age in the audience and it was tasteful viewing for their age imo for a pg13 film i found it kinda creepy couple jump scares does a good job on the main characters story and learning more as the movie progresses that explains whats going on a classic formula if youre a horror fan that likes a lot of gore and scares this wouldnt fit the bill
Mar 16 2024,negative,the plot line was ridiculous
Mar 16 2024,positive,imaginary is a cool film if you imagine it a 5110 for me its an interesting film that passes the time and an interesting story line about jessica and her sinister imaginary friend i guess time will tell if it deserves a sequel
Mar 16 2024,negative,that was one of the absolute worst movies i have ever seen the acting awful the plot ridiculous and awful the dialogue painfully awful in its entirety that was all together a disaster and never should have been made for a horror movie i sure did spend a lot of the time laughing at how terrible it was the supposed scary creature looked like a knock off chuck e cheese animatronic this movie should have never been filmed and the producers should be fired for approving this garbage dont waste your time and money i wish i could get that hour and a half of my life back 510 do not recommend
Mar 16 2024,negative,eh it was very basic not scary imo the bears monster form made me laugh lol the most interesting part was the lore on imaginary friends too bad it wasnt a big part of the movie i hated most of the characters
Mar 16 2024,positive,i like the teddy bear that was in it
Mar 16 2024,negative,the film was disappointing und very boring for horror fans it is not worth watching but maybe for easily scared people
Mar 16 2024,negative,not scary and lowkey cringe
Mar 16 2024,neutral,imaginary had its jump moments which the background suspense music helped realize but it felt like there were too many unrealized plot lines going on sometimes simple is best
Mar 16 2024,negative,watched it with my friend we laughed through half of it not because it was funny but mostly because the labyrinth has better cgi then this movie the acting was interesting and frankly it seemed basic and nothing 100 older movies havent done
Mar 16 2024,negative,it was ok until it got weird in the end
Mar 16 2024,positive,it is good but its not as scary as it looks
Mar 16 2024,negative,i thought this would be a good movie but it reminded me a lot of like a dar man video the acting wasnt good and it was hardly scary
Mar 16 2024,negative,unique but not something i will watch again
Mar 16 2024,negative,it felt like i was watching something cheaply made for the syfy channel
Mar 16 2024,negative,horrible movie the acting or lack of was hilarious  its like they were reading the script terrible dont waste your money ever
Mar 16 2024,positive,it was a fun movie cliche but fun
Mar 16 2024,positive,people are giving this movie terrible reviews but its not that horrible  the film is clearly not a horror film perhaps this disappointed some they made an effort to put in some jumpscares most of them were flawed however as the story progresses you become curious to understand the characters past the connections that the film brings it and when youre not expecting it boom another twist  for a lowbudget film it managed to exceed expectations  i dont think it deserves all these low reviews  again its quite flawed as a horror its more of a mystery and fantasy which doesnt necessarily make it bad
Mar 16 2024,negative,this movie lacks some originality and is a boring experience leading up to the ending a very forgettable movie in my opinion would not recommend watching
Mar 16 2024,positive,this movie had a good plot and some scary scenes
Mar 15 2024,negative,save your self the time dont watch it its boring and has some plot holes its just a waste of time
Mar 15 2024,negative,enough with the little kid horror movies that arent scary
Mar 15 2024,negative,yes i love horror movies did not love this one seemed to start out ok but once it went to another dimension that was it for me if there is a sequel i will not be going nothing scary about it
Mar 15 2024,positive,finally something that not only entertains but leaves you riveted to find out what is going to happen next the whole cast was awesome if you like betty buckley again and again she does not disappoint i would recommend imaginary
Mar 15 2024,positive,this is going to be an honest review the movie was good not great but certainly not terrible theres definitely some world building that theorists would love my and my wife spend the rest of the night just analyzing the movie after watching it     is it a perfect movie not even close theres a few plot holes inconsistencies things that could have been done better perhaps some better choice of actors but does the good make up for the bad for sure     personally i would recommend it if you have a nothing blamed and just want some good entertainment but i wouldnt tell you to drop everything and go see it     for me it is comparable to the conjuring movies its a solid peice of entertainment that is shallow enough for someone to jump in and enjoy it but also deep enough for theorists and lore enthusiasts to enjoy as well    i gave it a 5 out of 5 because it def doesnt deserve 50 audience score id like to see this thing at 7080 audience score it wasnt a bad movie at all  but i can see how it wouldnt be some peoples cup of tea i mean its a movie about an imaginary friend lets be honest theres a handful of people that were never going to like it but i think theres something here to enjoy and im excited for a sequel
Mar 15 2024,positive,i liked it because it was different type of movie i didnt dislike it
Mar 15 2024,negative,expect boredom two jump scares and a lot of bad bad acting  this movie was a cobbled together mess with absolute trash special effects and no direction  another lame attempt at horror by writer director jeff wadlow who should waddle his ass far away from making movies ie fantasy island and this movie  you know the story is bad when they have to intruduce a character in the third act who basically has alll the answers and explains the movie to the audience  oh yeah and whoever thought that using  tanning sunglassesblockers and silly putty on the actors eyes would be scary youre wrong it looks dumb
Mar 15 2024,negative,started off well in the first 2 minutes of the movie and then went flat  the acting from the whole cast was rigid and unbelievable  the story was generic and i honestly feel like this is one of the worst films ive ever seen  i expected much better from blumhouse
Mar 15 2024,positive,this movie is surprisingly better than the reviews would lead you to believe it was original and creepy with that said they flubbed the last 40 mins and totally changed directions but it was still a fun watch
Mar 15 2024,positive,its more of your typical horror fare will not exactly be memorable but its a fun watch
Mar 15 2024,positive,i dont understand why there is so many bad reviews for this movie its not scary at all the plot is great btw this will have spoilers   i didnt expect for taylor to say so many cuss words it was very funny and camila dies like theres blood coming from the door   but she deserves it my theater was clapping   anyway i would give this movie a different watch and i hope you enjoy imaginary like i did bye
Mar 15 2024,positive,i feel like this movie got way too much hate it was a good concept and personally the only thing i thought was bad about it was the fact that it wasnt horror and seemed more fantasy and suspense based besides that though the movie was good and i feel like people had too high of expectations for a movie that was pg13 the movie had a good plot made sense and i just dont see how some people dont understand certain aspects of the movie but thats just my opinion so i hope you found this helpful 
Mar 14 2024,negative,pyper braun merits praise imaginary otherwise falls flat    i was never locked into the story and i didnt really care for the characters at any point even brauns alice isnt all that interesting despite a rather great performance from the young actress dewanda wise is a bit dull while tom payne disappoints somewhat  i mean he only has a small role sure but his acting is unconvincing and i know he can actor far better as seen during his time on tvs the walking dead    the antagonists in this are poorly utilized the poster bear is prevalent but very boring it needed a chuckyesque portrayal rather than the blank stare we get every few minutes the ending also drags i thought it was going to end sooner a few times but it kept finding new ways to stick around nothing majorly grating granted the score is at least ok    it also amusingly took me ages to work out what the bears name was im not familiar with the name chauncey so genuinely for the longest time thought the name was either john c or shaun c it was only when i finally noticed it written down visually that i realised     in conclusion credit to braun but everyone else onscreen and off it couldve done better in my opinion
Mar 14 2024,positive,i took my wife and we enjoyed it she said it reminded her of her childhood
Mar 14 2024,positive,maybe this isnt a movie for horror fans who are obsessed with blood and gore but it is the right movie for those who want a good cheeky time and a whole lot of heart
Mar 14 2024,positive,not a bad popcorn movie for a weeknight i wish theyd kept the main character trapped in dreamworld longer with more of a chess match between her and the entity she should have entered dreamworld earlier in the movie and it would have had better flow
Mar 14 2024,positive,story kept me engaged and there were many twists some good cinematic shots and the acting was decent final 30min did feel a bit rushed not too many jumpscares or horror elements but pretty fun movie overall
Mar 14 2024,negative,the movie was extremely horrible all around
Mar 14 2024,neutral,i just imagine a good movie but came out with a bad one
Mar 14 2024,positive,imaginary had a good storyline plot and plenty of twists and turns along the way although it was not very scary the story and hidden monsters in the shadows brought chills and the ending was a masterpiece i would see this movie again
Mar 14 2024,positive,i thought it was a great balance of story and jump scares i liked it way more that the other blumhouse movies
Mar 14 2024,negative,worst movie ever acting was bad and so was the story
Mar 14 2024,positive,imaginary was pretty interesting it had some points that were reminiscent of other horror movies and the elements of spellcasting to open spaces for wicked entities to step in seemed a bit predictable at moments     however i still liked it i am sure that others who enjoy blumhouse movies particularly fans of fnaf and m3gan would definitely appreciate it but there were some things that i felt the writers couldve done a bit differently to make it flow with a bit more mystery to throw the audience off     all in all it was an enjoyable movie and had some decent jump scares
Mar 14 2024,positive,pretty good it was just very weird thats all kept me invested throughout the whole movie with some twists and turns some moments made me angry but thats a response that means the plot of the movie sticks with me overall pretty good but i liked night swim better
Mar 14 2024,positive,i thought it was thrilling and terrifying and its so much better than night swim
Mar 13 2024,positive,this was an amazing movie and it was an great story 
Mar 13 2024,negative,dont waste your time watching this movie it is one of the worse film i have seen in my entire lifetime
Mar 13 2024,positive,it was to me a pretty good suspense thriller movie  it kept me sitting on the edge of my seat while watching this movie  the creators and writers of this movie film script really created some imaginary characters
Mar 13 2024,positive,my 20 year old daughter and i share our love for horror movies and she wanted to see imaginary for her birthday at first we were skeptical due to the ratings but imaginary proved to be a fun idea and a decent movie there were a few twists and turns which werent necessarily mindbending but they suited the pg13 rating theres a few jumpscares and some leave you on the edge of the seat moments but over all it was decent worth a watch
Mar 13 2024,positive,very much a typical blumhouse horror movie not a super deep story no amazing character development but it passed the time
Mar 13 2024,neutral,it wasnt a horrible movie some parts felt misleading while other parts made me think it was an insidious movie it had a nice plot but failed to deliver during potential jumpscare opportunities once the movie climaxed all i wanted was for it to end
Mar 13 2024,positive,dewanda is the entire heart of this movie and as a giant scaredy cat  this is the perfect mix of comedy adventure mystic and a dash of horror
Mar 13 2024,positive,im sincerely belived they may do a better job with this movie  is kind slow and the movie story line is kind poor and afflicted the actors performances
Mar 13 2024,negative,starts off as an ok pg13 horror movie youve seen the previews  child being weirdly influenced by a toy bear that talks to her then theres a massive and unnecessary infodump complete with scholarly references and the movie spins into phantasmagorical mostly not scary badness
Mar 13 2024,positive,its was good the ending was a bit weird but trippy lol
Mar 13 2024,positive,contrary to the typical critics  i feel the movie is well paced well thought out and decently acted and directed  imo or if the better horror movie in the last few years 100x better than the nun
Mar 13 2024,negative,one of the worst movies ive seen belongs on tubi or something had to walk out after an hour
Mar 13 2024,positive,solid horror movie good date night tuesday cinemark movie type
Mar 13 2024,negative,save your money and time for a better movie
Mar 13 2024,negative,jeff wadlow needs to stop making horror movies and do other types of movies
Mar 13 2024,negative,the plot had too many unresolved problems and resulted in leaving you confused at the end of the story not too much horror overall
Mar 13 2024,positive,i loved it was fun good acting good story
Mar 13 2024,positive,great movie enjoyed it a lot
Mar 13 2024,negative,dont even bother wait for it to steam at home
Mar 13 2024,positive,not just another evil doll movie nor in this case evil teddy bear  at first i was bored as it seemed to concentrate too much on cloing little kids but they were good child actors  but later it became kinda interesting even if mystifying  confusing as it went into an other worldly sometimes escherlike landscape of fantastic peril things were not as they seemed giving it 3 stars as it passed the time well enuf tho i wouldnt rec it to everyone      saw it amc lerton 31224
Mar 13 2024,positive,a good watch much better than the rating
Mar 13 2024,positive,pretty great movie ill probably give it a 810
Mar 12 2024,negative,boring and very basic
Mar 12 2024,positive,this was a pretty decent offering  no gore the story line was good and suspenseful it could have used more jump scares but its hard to get me  we enjoyed it
Mar 12 2024,negative,betty buckley was insufferable lol
Mar 12 2024,negative,this movie was really stupid stupid
Mar 12 2024,positive,so i know a lot of people dislike this movie but i thought it was a fun time while the movie had flaws and some unexplained plot points i thought it was good overall and worth the watch i felt like the first half of the movie wasnt too slow and gave us plenty of small scares before the second half i thought all of the actors did a good job spoilers ahead skip to final sentence for spoilerfree final thoughts i thought it was a little bit cheesy when chauncey was talking and i think it would have been cooler if we only heard the little girl talk and not chauncey i did think it was awesome when it turned out that almost nobody else could see the teddy bear also i liked the scavenger hunt she had to do to get to the imaginary realm i loved it when chauncey was messing with the neighbors kid i think they did a good job of revealing jessicas backstory and explaining things you were confused on in the beginning if youre here for horror lets just say this is more of a suspenseful film the second half took a twist from light horror to a horroraction mix the imaginary realm was pretty creepy but i think that it could have been more colorful since it was representing a childs imagination i did love how they had to paint a door on the wall to get to the imaginary realm i thought it would have been a bigger twist if the old lady was actually one of the entities another thing i liked was the scene with taylor locked in the room with the sound and light projector i thought that was really creepy one thing i was confused on though were the entities there was the actualbear version of chauncey who looked much better in the film than the trailer a spider thing and a faceless human unless the faceless person and the spider were the same thing i believe they could have better explained their origins because i couldnt tell if chauncey was shapeshifting or they were 3 different monsters i did like the design of the monsters i did like the twist where it turns out jessica never left the imaginary realm but i thought the alieneyed people were a bit cheesy i think they should have had the same eyes as the ghost child who possessed foxy in fnaf the last thing i didnt like was the overusage of never ever which got old after about 3 times all of these were small things that didnt affect the overall film the ending with chauncey in the hotel was pretty cool and i loved how they played the chaunceytune at the beginning of the credits spoilers end here if you are a casual movie goer who isnt expecting to be terrified and can look over the minor flaws i believe you will enjoy this movie if you liked fnaf youll probably like this its better than anything disneys been putting out since 2020
Mar 12 2024,positive,i honestly really liked it sure some parts where not as interesting but the idea and consept of it his great i love chauncey and i even made a stuff animal of him and brought it to the movies when i went to watch it with a friend not going to lie but chauncey reminds me of five nights at freddys freddy
Mar 12 2024,positive,i thought the entire movie was well shot and a pretty good story was told just the ending seemed a bit rushed
Mar 12 2024,neutral,i had high hopes for the film the trailer made it look amazing the premise of a teddy bear imaginary friend was great but the fear factor never came from the film the husband in the film seemed peculiar it starts by making him seem central then he just gets in a car and leaves and comes back at the end of the film i would have preferred he was there for the whole film or they spent less time introducing him at the start the neighbours kid with the drugs completely pointless addition to the film because the climax to the scene was his mum coming and telling him off it would have been better to have something horrific happen to him and the elderly lady neighbour who babysat she was wooden unbelievable and seemed comedic in what was supposed to be a horror film another unnecessary distraction i did enjoy some of the twists but every time the suspense built up it seemed to deflate itself rather than peaking
Mar 12 2024,positive,the story was pretty good the acting was good and there are really good scares most of them sadly being spoiled in the trailer but that alright the ending was pretty crazy too
Mar 12 2024,negative,imaginarys trailer gets you interested because youre hoping for something more to the story at least i was the movie is a complete mess story is all over the place boring acting is subpar cast is predictable its really distracting while youre trying to enjoy it it brings the movie down the only part i enjoyed was the imaginary world if you can call it that i had some fun laughs but it was more like a goosebumps episode and the story was ehhhhh
Mar 12 2024,positive,it was a good movie with good acting and some really good jump scares the plot had some cliches and the fakeout ending was kind of weird but other than that it was a good movie to watch parts were funny others touching or horrifying and suspenseful the whole time
Mar 12 2024,negative,it was more for kids lol
Mar 12 2024,positive,i actually really liked this movie i think it was a nice twist and it had a lot of moments that really kept you at the edge of your seat not super scary but definitely had me jumping and closing my eyes i believe this movie was done well you could tell they really really went all in in making the graphics look as real as possible those eyes the thing at the end well done blumhouse cant wait to see what else you have to offer i love the creativity and twists too its not your typical scary movie and i love how much your movies are getting better and better at it
Mar 12 2024,negative,would have made more sense in the original unwokified script but still wasnt terrible not good but not the worst either
Mar 12 2024,negative,there was nothing to like it was boring and not scary the acting was subpar and disliked all the characters
Mar 12 2024,positive,it was good in my opinion
Mar 12 2024,negative,descends into a ridiculous mess
Mar 11 2024,negative,definitely not as good as any other blumhouse movie i watch everything from them i cant believe i actually paid to see thisin the theater it was terrible
Mar 11 2024,positive,original suspenseful story well acted perfect pg13 movie to make you jump 
Mar 11 2024,positive,thought it was pretty good    really enjoyable for my taste in horror films with good story
Mar 11 2024,positive,very very very good movie must see
Mar 11 2024,negative,well after seeing such there is a few parts that i can enjoy some of the jump scares do work from the beginning but they did dull down until the climax which the reveal of chauncy was disappointing  dewanda wise was the best out of the whole cast since she acted her best while the kids were just generic and the rest were just there being generic  well betty buckley was okay yet was falling out of place near the end  the way the imagery felt was decent but led right towards a disappointing ending  you could say this movie didnt imagine hard enough especially for a monster out of itself  310
Mar 11 2024,negative,no where as scary as i was hoping it would be just a bland okay movie
Mar 11 2024,positive,pretty good creepy movie with a couple intense momentsnot as scary as i expected
Mar 11 2024,positive,you dont expect this kind of movie to be nominated for an academy award but i do expect to have a great time watching it and a great time it was  good scares some great twists and turns and a lot of laughs
Mar 11 2024,neutral,the film wasnt bad but not as good as you can expect its a movie where you can guess whats gonna happen
Mar 11 2024,positive,i would give this movie an 80 because i was on the edge of my seat the whole time and i really enjoyed the plot it wasnt an oscar worthy movie but its worth to see in theaters for a fun time
Mar 11 2024,negative,its terrible yes but oh my god is it funny
Mar 11 2024,negative,a premise with some promise this film is really bad  mind you i was entertained the entire timelaughing and scoffing  some decent creepy visuals but never really any scares  when the worst actress perhaps of all time  the old neighbor who used to babysit the female lead enters into the fray this goes from ho hum to utter trash in no time  it has to be seen to be believed  ive never seen a single character derail an entire movie like this
Mar 11 2024,negative,i was so excited to see this movie and convinced a friend to go with me  i have never been so embarrassed so dreadfully flat and slow with halfrealized allusions to other horror classics the only success here was the marketing that tricked me into the theatre at least i had fun laughing with the stranger next to me while after my friend fell asleep
Mar 11 2024,positive,it was a half decent horror movie seems like the scariest scenes were all in the trailer not something id watch again but i dont regret seeing it
Mar 11 2024,neutral,there was some really good potential here but the direction they took most of the story is pretty nonsensical     spoiler warningish  i was hoping for the grandma to be like a red herring or someone who is just really interested in the supernaturalinner psych of children and their limitless imagination would have made the twist less cliche i add quotation marks because it really isnt a twist its so predictable     if this movie was animated or i fell like it would have given a better atmosphere with the whimsical features in the movie it felt like scooby doo imo    one more thing the actor that played jessicas dad did a phenomenal job
Mar 11 2024,negative,imaginary is the sum total of everything that is wrong with modernday horror cinema and blumhouse a terrible bombardment of clichés built on a completely calculated formula i almost had a heart attack while watching the movie    a cute daughter who sees ghosts a jerk big sister a sexy neighbor boy a stepmom ready to fight a busy father and a fake elise rainier seeing supernatural but moving on like nothing happened everyone becomes friends in the end     like cmon
Mar 11 2024,positive,im not a big fan of scary movies even though some would say this isnt a scary movie i do think it is quite ironic that this is like the scary juxtaposition of the upcoming movie if overall this movie still had a good storyline and was kind of funny at times
Mar 11 2024,negative,the story fell flat the acting and script needed work to force this to work unfortunately
Mar 11 2024,positive,this was a decent horror movie about imaginary friends as a child going into this i thought it would be average so i had low expectations but im glad that i had those because it tuned out to be better then i thought the family chemistry with the main actress and the kids was really well done and a few jumpscares here and there        spoilers       i wish that the final scenes werent really in this whole other dimension where the imaginary friends come from i would have liked it more if the final fightscenes took place just in the house would have been a little more realistic of sorts
Mar 11 2024,positive,the movie was great and enjoyable while it did have some scenes that fell flat overall its a good film it had a few unexpected plot twists that i didnt see coming in conclusion its a great movie and i highly recommend you watching it
Mar 11 2024,positive,it wasnt that scary
Mar 11 2024,positive,good movie took a while to get going but overall kept you guessing definitely seem worse movies from the same production company
Mar 11 2024,negative,slow start to a funny ending i hope blum house dont keep this up
Mar 11 2024,negative,too complicated of a set up  and the usual weak ending greatly diminished the films potential
Mar 11 2024,positive,i love this movie it pretty good it is thrilling and all of that recommend watching it
Mar 11 2024,positive,it was ok not great not the worst ive seen would recommend seeing for free on a streaming app rather than paying to see in theaters
Mar 11 2024,positive,my 13 year old son said that it was finally a movie that he didnt want to end so if he said that its definitely great to take your kid my son is not a big fan when it comes to any movie i also thought it was a different but a movie that had you mesmerized throughout i definitely think this was a five star movie
Mar 11 2024,positive,what usually is boring cliche and generic suprizingly scared me and drew me in definitely better than expected and left me leaving the theater satisfied well done
Mar 11 2024,negative,this is one of those movies where the concept was there but the overall execution fell flat the chemistry between the characters was non existent kind of like they accused the teddy bear of being  i will never ever watch this movie again
Mar 11 2024,positive,this movie was so good blumhouse never misses plot twist was crazy
Mar 11 2024,negative,jeff wadlow is the only director i know who can have a great idea and find a way to mess it up in the execution
Mar 11 2024,negative,the first part of the movie was actually pretty decent but it got worse and worse and monster looked so fake terrible movie
Mar 11 2024,positive,way better than average scary movie
Mar 11 2024,positive,its definitely different  but i enjoyed it i would recommend it 
Mar 11 2024,negative,it was a bore and a disappointment from the moment the lights went off in the theatre to when the credits rolled
Mar 11 2024,negative,just close your eyes and imagine the movie is good
Mar 11 2024,positive,it was good loved it
Mar 11 2024,positive,the acting was subpar i think i laughed a little bit more than jumped the main character i love her as an actress ive seen her in other stuff but dont waste your money wait til it comes out and watch it on a day when youre bored
Mar 11 2024,positive,great movie and story really creepy bear with awesome monsters too
Mar 11 2024,positive,an absolutely underrated film and while cheesy at times it delivers with twisted reveals and good horror
Mar 11 2024,positive,it has some nice jump scares but pretty slow in the beginning
Mar 11 2024,positive,good twist and very entertaining
Mar 11 2024,positive,characters were generally written and acted well  the story was neat with some good reveals  glad i watched
Mar 11 2024,positive,i did not have high hopes going into this movie do not get me wrong it wasnt a spectacular but it was a decent movie there was a lot that can be improved upon some of the imaginary characters were more comical than scary i liked the acting from alice played by pyper the little girl the concept was pretty original
Mar 11 2024,neutral,it was  okay movie nothing i would brag about but it wasnt a horrible movie
Mar 10 2024,neutral,from someone who hates horror movies and would prefer a cartoon fantasy or scifi i am glad it wasnt scary yes there were a few jump scares creepy toy music and a freaky bearbut the story behind it wasnt a horror as i would have more than likely hid the whole way through there was an interesting twist but besides that it was very slow and unfortunately it was wasnt very imaginable had the potential to be a terrifying movie but it definitely fell short even the demonic bear wasnt very scary looked more like a childrens idea of a scary bear with long claws and lots of teeth rather than an adults version
Mar 10 2024,neutral,more funny than scary creature design was ok
Mar 10 2024,positive,it was funny at the bear and the teen boy part
Mar 10 2024,positive,started a bit slow but the whole plot and graphics were really good  if youre a fan of horror or thrillers i recommend it
Mar 10 2024,negative,the first half of the movie is actually pretty goodbut then it just loses any and all control it turns into a comedy thats kind of funnythe problem is that its clear that isnt the intention which is what makes it awkward its hard to believe it has the same director throughout and they didnt switch off midway through the movie its like a plane ride that soars highand then justloses all engine power and nosedives straight to the ground into a fiery explosion
Mar 10 2024,positive,a wee bit underdeveloped but overall enjoyable pg13 horror fare with a few interesting twists and jump scares
Mar 10 2024,positive,really good went from a basic story to something no one would ever think of does have jumpscares and can get pretty scary
Mar 10 2024,negative,story was dumb and nothing was scary or interesting
Mar 10 2024,negative,boring and confusing
Mar 10 2024,negative,imaginary brings a lifeless tale with cliched sour and barley developed characters with the real show witnessing the horrendous writing and dialogue some characters holding the award for dumbest character in a feature length horror movie and coincidences along with scenes that contradict major points and twists in the movie as a plus doesnt shy to point out everything the directing and effects are solid along with pyper brauns acting and some notable scares other than that the imagination behind this film wasnt very inventive
Mar 10 2024,negative,first 40 minutes movie is good resf of the movie is junk waste of time and money
Mar 10 2024,positive,imaginary held a lot of potential but unfortunately it didnt deliver on its promises while the acting was decent and the characters were engaging at times the movie lacked the punch it needed to stand out the story had unique elements and creative setups for scares but it didnt deliver on them additionally the balance between horror and comedy was off which made it difficult to fully enjoy the film while some parts did make me chuckle it felt like it was trying too hard to be funny at times i would still recommend seeing it in theaters to get the full theater experience
Mar 10 2024,negative,i believe what makes great a horror movie is its ability to make you scared from thinking that could happen to me and get you to go home that night and turn on all the lights to make sure everythings ok this movie did well but just for the first half for the second half i started to ask myself what am i watching live action coraline
Mar 10 2024,positive,movie was enjoyable made me laugh more than it scared me though plenty of jump scares which im not a fan of i loved the concept i just think more could have been done with it or less it was worth one viewing for entertainment
Mar 10 2024,positive,overpowers its cliches which i guess is the best they can hope for
Mar 10 2024,positive,we really enjoyed the storyline cinematography and scare factor great for all ages too without gratuitous violence highly recommend
Mar 10 2024,neutral,this was just ok there is a lot  potential for this film but i feel it falls short in many areas i wouldnt say it was convoluted but rather an oversimplified plot that is reminiscent of a poor mans poltergeist with added elements of coraline
Mar 10 2024,positive,this movie was honestly super great there were things they could have done differently but the same con be said about any other movie im probably gonna buy it when it comes out because as someone who loves horror movies i thought this one was incredible and creative
Mar 10 2024,negative,first half not bad but the second half was all over the place grabbing storylines from other movies
Mar 10 2024,positive,honestly this movie was not that bad it was a fun experience to go watch in theaters i really hope it to have a sequel soon
Mar 10 2024,neutral,had an okay theme behind it with a mediocre story that the actors did their best with while there were moments of suspense i never got a real sense of fear or danger
Mar 10 2024,negative,spoiler alert ok so i did not like this movie for a number of reasons 1 the ending didnt make any sense at all  the bear is just some random werewolf thing that is haunting random kids childhoods and what about the dad i dont get what happened to him it doesnt add up and the grandma too she just turns against them and dies out of nowhere 2 the little girl had better acting than anyone else in the movie she literally carried the entire movie 3 i have a lot of questions that werent answered in the movie and that could just be the way its set up like a cliff hanger or something but its just not for me 4 lastly for a horror movie that mind as well be a disney movie i did not feel scared at all during the movie and i know it probably made for kids but it wasnt scary at all ok thanks for reading watch at your own risk  a very disappointed girl who thought this movie was gonna be good 
Mar 10 2024,positive,i thought the movie would be horrible but it wasnt bad it was a good way to pass time the lead actors were solid the jump scares were funny the entire theater was gasping and laughing the plot wasnt 100 predictable id say its a solid option to watch on a boring day just go into it lighthearted and dont take it so seriously
Mar 10 2024,positive,it was a slowburn film but when it hit the third act it was amazing
Mar 10 2024,positive,i almost fell out of my seat with all the twists and turns this movie threw at me loved it 
Mar 10 2024,positive,went into this movie not expecting much however i was pleasantly surprised with great performances from dewanda wise and pyper braun this movie exceeded my expectations
Mar 10 2024,positive,a child could probably write this movie better but it definitely stuck the landing
Mar 10 2024,positive,it wasnt bad not scary either overall just mediocre but still worth a watch if nothing else to do
Mar 10 2024,neutral,average thought it was going to be something but wasnt
Mar 10 2024,negative,omg this movie was the worse
Mar 10 2024,negative,it had a few good parts but wasnt what i was expecting from the trailers
Mar 10 2024,negative,super corny definitely not scary at all
Mar 10 2024,negative,too much going on plot was boring cute bear tho
Mar 10 2024,negative,it was starting good but then the story got dumb
Mar 10 2024,positive,great plot had me at the edge of my seat with unexpected scenes definitely recommend
Mar 10 2024,positive,i mean it was ok it has a solid premise  good acting and nice scares but beyond that it fell kinda flat   but the worst part chaunceys probably still hungry 
Mar 10 2024,positive,i feel like this could be a good series after they learn where they can improve from the first film and come up with an another twisted story line
Mar 10 2024,negative,terrible wasnt scary feel asleep
Mar 10 2024,positive,really enjoyed the movie dont trust the critics score thought it was a unique horror story with consistent suspense
Mar 10 2024,positive,this movie really brings teddy bears to life  otherworldly with hints of evil but not so scary that ill throw away my own toys after going home from the theatre
Mar 10 2024,positive,a great thriller kept me on the edge of my seat even through some of the cheesier moments
Mar 10 2024,positive,very great concept with a mess with your mind feel great for a casual horror movie watcher myself being someone who only likes certain horror movies such a as friday the 13th seriess footprintszombeavers and many more i enjoyed the story and the hints it dropped im a simple guy that doesnt like super crazy horror movies this was perfect
Mar 10 2024,neutral,written for kids good for the family
Mar 10 2024,positive,i have not watched to many movies that i cant predict and this was one that creeped me out and kept me on my toes
Mar 10 2024,positive,imaginary has fun practical effects and a simple storyline it doesnt tread any new ground and is exposition heavy at time but it was a fine matinee and im glad to have spent some time with it also little pyper braun delivers some of the best acting in the movie
Mar 10 2024,positive,i was skeptical because of the reviews but it was actually very good constant jump scares and twists and turns there wasnt much gore however i dont think it needed it my heart pounded out of my chest the whole time its no slasher but its amazing on its own
Mar 10 2024,positive,i absolutely loved this movie this movie has many jump scares would definitely recommend for 8 and older blood and scars are definitely not for kids movie scared some kids in my theater so bad that they straight up screamed 100 recommended 
Mar 10 2024,negative,so lame it was very over hipped just for the audience and movie to ruin it the plot was literally everywhere and then at the very end they decide to bring up a plot stupid if you wanna see a mid movie that you can watch to fall asleep then this one is for you
Mar 10 2024,positive,imaginary is one of my favorite movies blumhouse has ever made sure the pacing could have been work on a little bit but the delivery was great also sometimes you can see the scares from a mile away but it still gave a good scare out of me overall blumhouse cooked on this movie and that was good imaginary is a movie i would put on anytime
Mar 10 2024,neutral,got a couple scares out of me and the concept is there but the result was just something you can put on to pass the time
Mar 10 2024,positive,more people couldve died
Mar 10 2024,negative,wow its bad really bad like how on earth did this get made its so bad
Mar 10 2024,neutral,could have been scarier should have gotten an r rating and taken it a bit further
Mar 10 2024,positive,very solid and very silly horror flick with just the right amount of goofiness to keep you entertained the child actor did a fantastic job as both the daughter and the imaginary friend the story was well paced and despite it being somewhat lacking at times and over reliant on jump scares id definitely recommend it to anyone who loves silly horror like i do
Mar 10 2024,negative,corny just all over the place i was confused
Mar 10 2024,negative,it started out like it had some potential ànd a storythen i waited and waited for it to become a scary movie then the last 45 minutes or so which should have rewarded the wait just brought a bizarre mishmash of an ending that was so stupidly crafted that it actually had me laughing at scenes jokes on me they took my  and ran
Mar 10 2024,positive,loved the visuals everyone did a fantastic job on the movie and i adored it it was so awesome
Mar 10 2024,positive,it was ok thought it would be more of a horror movie
Mar 10 2024,neutral,it could have had more scary scenes and it really wasnt that scary not worth buying a movie ticket but maybe well find the movie when it comes out only reason i say it like that because you have to buy drinks and everything out at the theaters you can just buy the movie if you dont like it you dont allowed to watch it again but not a movie ticket waste of money
Mar 10 2024,positive,imaginary is a mediocre film though its filled with many moments that will surely give you a fright and the cast does a great job the movie falls short of cliché expectations and tropes the movie suffers by its smaller budgetlack of antagonist and blumhouses style and flare but its not a bad film at all its a film that should be enjoyed at home but is fun and watchable once in theaters
Mar 10 2024,negative,the premise of the flick is really interesting and theres some wonderful moments in it but the dialogue is absolutely atrocious and i felt bad for the actors having to try and pull a good performance from it it was hard to get through a lot of the cringeworthy writing excellent monster too though
Mar 10 2024,neutral,i know the budget is probably a lot more but this looked like it was made with 100k the main character was so good and so kind that even though the bratty teen needed to hear shes awful the mc only said it because it hurt her more to say like i must not be very kind because i wouldve said it long ago and everything was too easy and no one died well the person you expect died overall it felt like a made for tv movie that comes on at three am
Mar 10 2024,positive,wow what can i say this film has a great story very good acting and creepy jump scares i absolutely loved it the costumes were very well made and gave me a very heavy vibe on creature feature style monsters ofc the only problem i had was that there was only one proper death in the film but even though there was one it worked pretty well and it didnt really feel like the film needed to be a bloodshed thats as much as i can say hope this review was helpful
Mar 10 2024,neutral,it was what i expected it to be ok story with a few twists unfortunately it just didnt quite hit the mark for me i would say if you decide to wait until it hit streaming servicesit wouldnt hurt anything
Mar 10 2024,positive,imaginary takes the idea of a lonely kid using a coping mechanism to help themselves  turns it on its head the idea that a child could end up with something akin to a vampire when they just wanted a friend is so terrifying yet so believable imagination is a powerful thing who knew it had abomb kinda kick no wonder we lose it as we age
Mar 10 2024,positive,imaginary takes us on a journey into the eerie depths of childhood imagination jessica portrayed by the strongwilled dewanda wise revisits her childhood home with her family including her stepdaughter alice on discovering a teddy bear named chauncey alices behaviour takes a strange turn under his influence leading to very unsettling events jessica senses something is wrong and embarks on a frantic mission to rescue her daughter from the grip of this seemingly real imaginary companion    the film cleverly taps into a human fearthe hidden darkness that can reside within innocent childhood fantasies it reminded me of movies like the babadook 2014 where the boundary between fantasy and reality blurs evoking a sense of unease however imaginary falls short of reaching the same psychological depth of horror while it delivers some atmospheric moments the scares rely more on sudden jumps and noises than on sustained dread    the performances are strong with wise carrying the emotional weight as the determined mother young pyper braun skilfully portrays alices transition from innocence to something more unsettling effectively capturing her characters descent some of the side characters in the movie feel like they could use more depth and their reasons for doing things are a bit unclear    the visual style of the film is a bit mixed while the use of colours effectively sets a gloomy tone the special effects especially in later scenes start to look like unconvincing cgi the editing keeps things moving at a good pace but some transitions feel abrupt and disrupt the overall flow    what really stands out about imaginary is its sound design the music is a blend of twisted nursery rhymes and eerie strings that perfectly match the unsettling vibe the sound of alices panicked whispers while playing with chauncey gave me chills    imaginary is a film with a promising concept it doesnt quite reach its potential but it still manages to deliver some decent scares the performances are solid and the atmosphere is eerie the sound design is top notch however issues like underdeveloped characters inconsistent special effects and pacing problems prevent it from being truly terrifying    for fans of horror movies who enjoy exploring themes related to the darker side of childhood imaginary offers an entertaining popcorn flick experience it may not scare you to the point of hiding under the covers but it will certainly make you reconsider the makebelieve companions your children make friends with
Mar 10 2024,negative,it was horrible this is a horror for a four year old the monster bear just took me out good story line but awful in scary department this shouldve went straight to crackle
Mar 10 2024,negative,slow and dumb not scary at all and for some stupid reason there will be a part 2 dont waste your money

Mar 10 2024,positive,well acted story was decent great creature design and special effects
Mar 9 2024,negative,the plot i felt was dragged along there were some good scenes that hyped me up i feel all the good scenes were presented in the trailer of the movie
Mar 9 2024,negative,blumhouse let me down  i was not scared anxious or terrified or chair clingy at all  i  get the story line but i love scary im talking i wanted to be so scared that i came home and set my daughters stuff animals on fire      instead i got a movie scary for a 5 year old
Mar 9 2024,negative,i really did not like it at all horror movies should foreshadow not forespoil whats going to happen the scene with her talking to the bear under the covers all i could do was laugh horror  make me think the kid is there and not a little unscary teddy our cabbage patch was scarier than that my teens liked it
Mar 9 2024,negative,there were some good ideas in this movie but by the time they get there you dont care about any of it oddly overly suspenseful music felt out of place and the first hour is a slog disappointing
Mar 9 2024,positive,it so fuckin ass imaginary
Mar 9 2024,positive,i enjoy it my crush and me love that movie she got scared that i hold her
Mar 9 2024,negative,too childlike for adults too adult for children they didnt have a real plan for making this movie

Mar 9 2024,negative,not for children would like a refund

Mar 9 2024,positive,critics have the same opinion this movie is filled with more plot twists than i can even explain there are moments in the film where you still think about what could happen in a sequel even after the movies over fun jump scares and doesnt even have a good or bad ending it has a mysterious ending go watch this movie
Mar 9 2024,positive,wow i think this movie is great   every jumpscares always get me   from the beginning to the end the story gets even darker this is amazing chauncey is freaking creepy dayum 7910
Mar 9 2024,positive,well crafted slow burn story and character development keeps you engaged
Mar 9 2024,positive,an interesting twist on childhood  imaginary friends  of course dont let the kids watch it   definitely on the upper end of blumhouse productions
Mar 9 2024,negative,cash grab i have a better time watching scary cheesy 80s horror this was what it was like watching a bad low budget flick on hbo in 1995
Mar 9 2024,positive,it was had some scary sceens that would make you jump

Mar 9 2024,positive,its a good pg 13 movie not too scary but scary enough
Mar 9 2024,negative,this movie was a total waste of time and money there is no horror in that movie which had potential in the beginning but the story plot was so stupid and it was so long that we couldnt wait to get out of the theatre it is more of a fantasy movie than anything else
Mar 9 2024,positive,i really enjoyed this movie great horror
Mar 9 2024,positive,it was so real and kept you on the edge of your seat
Mar 9 2024,negative,the story had promise but it didnt realise its full potential the director built the tension but it failed to be truly scary
Mar 9 2024,positive,i dont know why this is getting hate by the critics i went it fully expecting it to be awful instead i was pleasantly surprised by the wild ride the movie was sure the writing isnt the best but its an all around fun watch
Mar 9 2024,positive,good in a switch off brain friday night movie way  not too scary and fun in places  it looked like the ideas were bigger than the budget with some budget effects and parts of the movie felt heavily borrowed from other horror movies  but still more enjoyable than recent blumhouse
Mar 9 2024,positive,not the worst horror movie out there definitely worth watching just for fun or to kill time dont expect great things from this movie tho
Mar 9 2024,negative,imaginary had potential to be a fun horror film but failed to execute many plot holes ridiculous jump scares that arent scary the practical and makeup effects were impressive the main actress and the little girl did a great time i enjoyed their relationship
Mar 9 2024,negative,its a horror movie that isnt the least bit scary most of the scares were in the trailers too many unnecessary characters who leave little to no impact on the story terrible writing wasted potential zero creativity
Mar 9 2024,negative,it was a great laugh not the best horror movie in a long shot
Mar 9 2024,positive,its a great movie more horror than fnaf but not to the point that you are shiting your pants if i was you i would go and watch it now i hope you have fun plus there is lore good bye
Mar 9 2024,positive,i wasnt expecting much from a generic concept but somehow everything was almost perfectly executed the suspense the pacing the scares etc were all super well done great job to blumhouse
Mar 9 2024,positive,my kids loved it better than i thought it was going to be kept me entertained
Mar 9 2024,neutral,easy to figure out was one step ahead of movie whole time not scary relied on jump scares plot and storyline was weak and acting not good ending was ok all the scary movies this year are disappointing and this one is no different but maybe a little better
Mar 9 2024,positive,i liked it it was part coraline part alice in wonderland and part poltergeist marvel could take notes on how to make a female lead action
Mar 9 2024,positive,great spin on an all to common childhood fear blumhouse did a great job
Mar 9 2024,negative,theater audience let out an audible sigh when it ended was relief from the pain of watching such a terrible movie awful acting dialogue was painful had potential but knew it was going to be bad from the jump with the acting

Mar 9 2024,negative,first 20 min were the scariest after that it was pretty poopoo
Mar 9 2024,negative,110 the worst ending of all time stupid stupud
Mar 9 2024,positive,i feel the film even though entertaining and scary in important spots it just doesnt keep a consistency maybe thats the point maybe a dark twist on alice and wonderland i dont know but if so its the fact it just couldnt decide on what movie it was trying to be and i think thats what hurt it the most in story telling 610
Mar 9 2024,positive,such a creative take on an old concept there are so many puzzle pieces that this movie beautifully connects together at the end definitely worth seeing again
Mar 9 2024,positive,blumhouses imaginary from writerdirector jeff wadlow is an uncannily offputting experience that provides real thrills despite not being scary
Mar 9 2024,negative,i think i wouldve enjoyed shooting myself in the foot more
Mar 9 2024,negative,more silly fun garbage from blumhouse
Mar 9 2024,positive,hands down best movie great twist
Mar 9 2024,positive,when jessica moves back into her childhood home with her family her youngest stepdaughter alice finds a stuffed bear named chauncey as alices behavior becomes more and more concerning jessica intervenes only to realize that chauncey is much more than the stuffed toy bear she believed him to be    if this one is anything it certainly is ambitious  the first half is formulaic  but the second half is a trip lots of twists and crazy imagery    the child actors and main actress do a very good job despite the hokey dialog one character in the movie is almost just there to provide exposition  i started calling her exposition granny also the film does explain quite a bit which kind of makes one feel alienated that they felt the audience was too dumb to comprehend everything     overall  a fun time at the cinema and worth the trip just dont set your standards super high    imaginary is imaginative     34    grade b
Mar 9 2024,positive,i liked it went with a friend to see a scary flick with no real lasting effect and it delivered sure the cgi is subpar and the ending sucks but its blumhouse come on now the overall story was good i always love the child innocence motif with the teddy bear the main child actor was great as alice it had some good jumpscares and though a lot of plot holes were left unexplained the ending did wrap up everything that was mainly important pretty good id recommend if youre bored and looking for a typical pg13 horror movie
Mar 9 2024,positive,just an absolute fun scary movie cheap scares with throwback 80s nods to horror classics hidden in there this movie is exactly what it should be a great time

Mar 9 2024,negative,wow this sucks characters are not recommend horror wasnt bad and could be more intense this is the second worst film by blumhouse this year the first being night swim jason blum is stupid the dialogue writing and story was my god that was awful jezz i would see cabrini more because that has better story dialogue character development and the writing the creature wasnt bad but would be more bloodier more scarier and more intense like a creature was stirring that was more entertaining the characters were forced and no one likes that the is the first film that universal pictures did not distribute this film lionsgate distribute this film this is a 025 there is so much stupidity and i wont watch this again
Mar 9 2024,negative,imaginary is a slog that doesnt amount to much more than a lazy combination of some of the most generic modern horror tropes its story is muddled and doesnt live up to its concept
Mar 9 2024,positive,the movie had a lot of corny and crazy moments to it it was a little jumpy but thats it

Mar 9 2024,positive,very good good story good movie
Mar 9 2024,positive,it was ok it was not like a big blockbuster horror film but it was fine
Mar 9 2024,negative,if you have seen insidious 2010 the boy 2016 or the boogeyman 2023 you have already seen this film imaginary is a horror film that ironically lacks imagination and creativity feeling like a mix of clichés that we have seen before in the genre this becomes just another ordinary supernatural horror film the only positive aspect that was well handled without giving spoilers was the plot twist related to the teddy bear it was a detail that i did not anticipate and gave a positive point to this film unfortunately when it comes to the script plot and acting these are average the lack of gore and scary moments was to be expected due to the pg13 rating this is not a movie for horror fans who have seen everything and expect a good scare instead it is more appropriate for people who want to watch a horror movie without being scared although of course there are better options for that
Mar 8 2024,positive,a classic a horror mystery film made for all with a very charming cinematographer
Mar 8 2024,positive,i thought the movie was awesome i loved it i would go back again to watch the movie ill give 1010

Mar 8 2024,positive,from what ive seen from critics expressing their honest opinion on this new horror it may not have been the best to some people but to me this movie still packs a bit of a punch in terms of creature features defo recommend if youre a fan of creature features
Mar 8 2024,positive,so fresh and creatively done very good movie if you love horror and mystery movies
Mar 8 2024,negative,teddy bear horror movie plays it too safe and toothless

Mar 8 2024,positive,its actually not awful with some good scares here and there and good running length with some ok twists at the end  i seen worst horror flicks
Mar 8 2024,positive,it was a great movie an was definitely unique only downfall was the jump scares they werent great and felt repetitive but i have to give it 4 stars because of the originality of this film and it felt fresh
Mar 8 2024,neutral,blumhouse has been churning out duds lately  there were good creepiness but very few and far between  the third act was a mess for me and the teen and child actors were pretty annoying
Mar 8 2024,positive,i love blum house movies great scary movie
Mar 8 2024,positive,imaginary is another blumhouse scary movie  not the usually tongue  in check dialogue  a few jumps scares  not a waste of time
Mar 8 2024,negative,other than the fact that it was very slow moving and very predictable my only wish is that i had imagined that i spent time watching it
Mar 8 2024,negative,expected better from blumhouse it was a mediocre horror film little to no jumpscares and the storyline was so predictable
Mar 8 2024,positive,this is what you want from a theatrical movie the humor horror but not too scary for those scaredy cats like myself storytelling double twists and just a good time great for dates and friends
Mar 8 2024,neutral,so much potential and love some of the ideas but overall this was meh the dialogue is the true imaginary because sheeesh
Mar 8 2024,negative,quite possible the worst horror movie ive ever watched it was boring not remotely scary and the acting was awful zero chemistry between the actors horrible writing casting and acting dont waste your time
Mar 8 2024,neutral,so boring and not scary at all like the concept but this is better than night swim
Mar 8 2024,neutral,imaginary is a predictable run of the mill horror movie that relies on jump scare to do the heavy lifting even as it toys with campiness before fully embracing it in its final act     full review    
Mar 8 2024,negative,terrible movie bad acting all around dont waste your time
Mar 8 2024,positive,was ok fell apart in third act the more it tried to weave a backstory the sillier it got audience was laughing at screaming i saw 
Mar 8 2024,negative,a thoroughly uncreative frightfest  ironically enough  imaginary is as rudimentary as pg13 horror gets
Mar 8 2024,positive,spoilers probably the most compelling horror movie i have ever seen and all for the wrong reasons this is a horror movie there isnt a lot of suspense and there is only one death in the movie but what really got me in love with the movie is the imaginary aspect the movie played and i got so attached to a lot of these characters and they killed their roles perfectly the girl really did catch me off guard at times especially at the nailed fence scene i was wideawake seeing so many twists coming the concept where imagination is hells creation really sets the theme of the story and had me on the edge of my seat i think there couldve been more but it was extremely welldone really the only flaw in this movie was the neighbor was pretty useless and he shouldve been replaced by the dad if i would rewatch many horror movies its this movie right next to m3gan because they did such a great job with character development and subtle twists
Mar 8 2024,positive,i had no idea what this movie was really about when i went to see it the story line develops well however i wish there had been more jump scares the concept was good as imaginary friends is a cool concept the end got more intense and had a nice twist to it when you thought it was ending its an enjoyable watch and kept me entertained but i probably wouldve been buoyed it just as much streaming
Mar 8 2024,positive,original suspensethriller with some tense moments although not particularly scary still a good overall movie that didnt resort to gore for shock value it started out tense and kept the interest high although it did devolve into more of a satirical campy ending not the best but worth a watch especially with the dearth of good movies out currently
Mar 8 2024,negative,not a good movie was expecting something different acting wasnt the best and the storyline was weird
Mar 8 2024,negative,i walk out of the theaterboring and lame
Mar 8 2024,positive,really great psychological horrorthriller type of movie i do think there couldve been a lot more animation of horrifying imaginary characters i found the actual horror aspect a little lackluster but overall is a good film if you go into this with more of the mentality of a psychological thriller youll love it i am just an avid horror fan so maybe this was just too mild for me i feel like there was a lot of missed opportunities because of this being made as a pg13 movie instead of rated r which sadly seems to be a common trend in horror now a days sadly worth a watch just wish more had been done to add to the scare factor
Mar 8 2024,positive,it was alright nothing special but somewhat engaging its a fun movie to see with friends and yell at the screen some of the performances left a lot to be desired
Mar 8 2024,negative,i didnt see the movie  the place was trashed up and it stink real bad
Mar 8 2024,neutral,this movie is a watchable but below average scary movie to me i found the scares to be just okay and the story line to be soso at best it also has an ending that was just unnecessary given the final results this is one that held more promise in the trailer than it really delivered
Mar 8 2024,positive,if you want a horror mix between coraline and drop dead fred go see this movie i took a star off because the final battle was kind of weak but the twists were kind of cool
Mar 8 2024,positive,very entertaining jumpscares pretty good plot all around good horror film
Mar 8 2024,positive,the plot twists in this movie
Mar 8 2024,positive,in imaginary a really good job was done with the characters and its lore the scares were not bad but couldve been better still i really enjoyed the story and the performances from dewanda wise and pyper braun were excellent
Mar 8 2024,positive,there are very good jump scares and the suspense to me is what took the cake but overall i would recommend this movie to anyone
Mar 8 2024,positive,i went in expecting a basic haunting movie but i ended up getting something totally unexpected the twist in the 2nd act was great
Mar 8 2024,positive,took a minute to get started good ending
Mar 8 2024,negative,terribly written  freddy fazbear meets alice in wonderland meets caroline yes caroline  well done for the actors but i cant say that for the prosthetic makeup that looked cheaply done blumhouse needs better story lines better writers snooze fest  come on blumhouse you can do much better 
Mar 8 2024,negative,the writing just makes no god damn sense it sticks out like the biggest sore thumb and really is to the films detriment the film otherwise has surprisingly funenough horror and tone it really is just such a shame the writing went to such waste      mixed
Mar 8 2024,negative,its a blumhouse film so the movie has to be fantastic right no its just bad maybe its the rockstar dad who serves no real purpose but to be the reason the kids are in the movie or the stereotypical teenstepmom storyline or maybe its the high hopes i had at the beginning of the movie that were crushed when i realized these were actually the main actors horror movies are a blumhouse specialty so how did it all go so wrong for starters the characters werent likable  at all it seemed more like a high school performance than an actual blumhouse movie the mother of the teen next who lived next door gave the best performance in her less than 30second role only to be overshadowed by the adorable maltipoo who pranced in and out a couple of times im so disappointed and really hope blumhouse learns from this flop
Mar 8 2024,negative,further proving blumhouse hasnt mastered the art of horror movies just yet imaginary is unoriginal and rarely scary
Mar 8 2024,positive,i bit predictable but a fun movie the scenes in the dark were a bit blurry but could have been our screen
Mar 8 2024,positive,great plot twist and story
Mar 8 2024,positive,this movie is very good it is the best blumhouse movie since halloween 2018
Mar 8 2024,positive,imaginary puts blumhouse back on the right track of horror    blumhouse has become synonymous with spinetingling tales that often leave audiences debating the fine line between fear and fascination their latest offering imaginary is no exception as one of my favorite studios known for hits and occasional misses this film captivated me from the start imaginary ventures into the realm of childhood imagination a territory both familiar and unnervingly surreal the concept of imaginary friends takes a chilling turn as the narrative unfolds it pushes the boundaries of its pg13 rating with creativity and finesse    the film excels in its ability to deliver heartstopping jump scares it also maintains a premise that is both fun and wildly imaginative the world imaginary builds is vibrant and whacky inviting viewers to immerse themselves fully in its eerie charm one standout element is the character of chauncey the bear whose unsettling presence lingers long after the credits roll rising star pyper braun delivers a standout performance as alice she effortlessly steals the show with her portrayal of a young girl caught in the grip of something sinister joining braun are dewanda wise and taegen burns they both shine in their respective roles contributing to the films overall sense of female empowerment and camaraderie    for firsttime horror watchers this blumhouse film is an excellent introduction to the genre  it expertly navigates the balance between suspense and spectacle the film offers a thrilling ride that keeps audiences on the edge of their seats at its core imaginary explores the eerie world of childhood imagination with a fresh perspective inviting viewers to reconsider the things that go bump in the night with its inventive premise and stellar performances this film deserves both a sequel and spinoff to explore its captivating universe further in a recent interview with imaginary stars veronica falcon and alix angelis the actresses shed light on the films production and their experiences bringing their characters to life    i give imaginary 4 out of 5 stars its a mustwatch for horror enthusiasts and casual viewers alike it offers a thrilling blend of scares and storytelling that will leave audiences eagerly anticipating what blumhouse has in store next
