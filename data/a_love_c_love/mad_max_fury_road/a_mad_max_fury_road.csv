Feb 6 2024,positive,a perfect movie and farandaway the best action of the decade so many original characters with underrated arcs all the more impressive with lack of dialogue and short runtime the awards speak for themselves when it comes to the editing and visual effects well worth the 37 year wait
Jan 29 2024,negative,worse then thunderdome  i watched when it came out and didnt like it  all this time later i keep seeing reviews on how great it is so i watched it again over the weekend  still dont see to merit the strong reviews  they should have ended with road warrior
Jan 27 2024,positive,the type of film you can just unplug your brain and enjoy the ride
Jan 27 2024,positive,visually stunning and well acted mad max fury road proves that hope can lie at the end of the difficult roads we most often travel
Jan 25 2024,positive,this is a great story in the mad max universe charleze theron shows shes willing to push her acting skills to the max and portrays the heroine in a superb fashion hardy is equally as fantastic respecting the rather dull scenery while applauding the cinematography it is what it is  postapocalypse world with everything going to hell
Jan 23 2024,positive,i enjoyed the original mad max trilogy and it was very entertaining but nothing compared to this one it was wall to wall action with no break its definitely worth the watch
Jan 22 2024,positive,absolute goat of a montage effects choreography
Jan 21 2024,positive,i like everything in this movie scenes music dynamic 
Jan 20 2024,positive,this is a story about girls help girls when these girls said to each other we are not things and we are not his measure i was moved so much
Jan 10 2024,positive,mad max fury road is one hell of a ride from beginning to end this film is heart pounding the actionchoreography is fantastic and leaves you with one very big adrenaline rush all due to its fast pace the pacing was very fast which worked well for this kind of story then there are the performances which are great charlize theron tom hardy and nicholas hoult where all great in this film with each one of seemingly becoming their characters rather than acting as them in terms of direction george miller shows off his abilities miller is amazing at making this steam punk dystopian world come to life the fact that most of the visuals are made via practical effects is crazy to add onto this the cinematography and colors are great as well mad max fury road is very fine filmmaking    with all that being said i do find flaws in this film the characters are pretty bland the film is mostly fast paced however it does slow down at certain points to focus on its characters characters like furiosa max and nux were explored but they werent explored enough to make them particularly strong characters they had the potential and when they were being explored it was great however they werent fully exploreddeveloped which is definitely the films biggest flaw the visual effects also looked a bit wacky and poor at times but that is more of a nitpick than an actual flaw     mad max fury road is from a visual and practical sense phenomenal with great themes and performances however its characters arent particularly its strong point regardless this is a fantastic film that ill highly recommend
Jan 6 2024,positive,greatest action movie of all time no debate
Jan 4 2024,positive,great reboot and a great film for action fans while i initially didnt care for tom hardys performance it kind of grew on me after a second watch he has very little dialogue but really does seem mad and haunted by his past i hope the upcoming furiosa movie is similar to this
Dec 29 2023,positive,i liked this so much more that i thought i would   see it on a big screen it is beautiful
Dec 26 2023,positive,tom hardy and charlize theron did a great job with this film great action good acting and very entertaining
Dec 26 2023,neutral,not really my thing i found the undercranking speeding up the frames annoying and hard to watch thank you
Dec 24 2023,positive,one of the best action movie in cinematic history  breathetaking third act   a widely immersive  a stunning experience
Dec 17 2023,positive,one of the best action movies of all time
Dec 14 2023,positive,the cinematography in this movie is beautiful the story is good the score is not to bad ether  over all it is worth a second watch
Dec 13 2023,positive,nothing short of a spectacular miracle it exceeds your expectations on every conceivable level and will likely remain the gold standard for action blockbuster filmmaking for decades to come that george miller could return to this franchise 30 years later and make a movie that could easily be the best mad max entry is not something anyone could have anticipated
Dec 1 2023,positive,maybe the greatest chase movie ever made
Nov 24 2023,positive,definitely has the feel of fallout new vegas for any fallout fans the cheesy humor in some parts is chefs kiss it made me feel nostalgia for a time yet to exist in our timeline
Nov 21 2023,positive,i was indifferent to the original mad max movie and i remember being disappointed by it on several attempts to watch it so i wasnt expecting much from this sequel was i wrong though this movie is almost non stop action and the story is both exciting and easy to follow the special effects are first rate and i soon became absorbed into the films world to be honest the characters dont have a lot to say and you mostly pick up the plot from riding with them on their journey thats not a bad thing in this case because the films pace is such that there is no time for the verbose narrative often found in other movies i highly recommend this movie to everyone who likes action movies because it is one of the best i have seen
Nov 21 2023,positive,this is a test review
Nov 18 2023,positive,all time classic pretty much everything about this is flawless the only minor complaints is there isnt much character development with max and dare i say it feels like hes not even the main character at certain points furiosa is incredible and the best thing in this she outshines max also the fact they go back the way they came makes it feel a little bit like the escape of the first half was pointless to an extent but who cares this is 2 hours of a straight adrenline rush and the most action packed of the franchise i will say this is a hair beneath mad max 2 for me because while hardy is really good as max gibson is better also max had more development and focus and while the chases in this are amazing and incredible the end of the second still i feel is slightly better however where the second can be a bit slow in the first half this floors it and never lets up the entire way its really just personal taste at that point comparing this and 2 watch it and decide for yourself
Nov 18 2023,positive,theres an early scene where a metal bard riffs on a flamethrowerguitar for no reason other than that he can already a highlight it only gets better from there and this actionpacked romp has loads of great character development to boot just stellar
Nov 17 2023,positive,absolutely phenomenal movie amazing action and amazing sound the entire movie

Sep 16 2023,positive,at first i hated it it was so overthetop stupid that i couldnt bring myself to finish it until i did the drinker and downed a bottle of jack while watching and now i cant get enough of this movie fury road is a masterpiece in its own right just dont take it too seriously and get yourself a drink while watching it
Aug 31 2023,positive,black and chrome edition     this may be the definitive version of mad max fury road
Aug 27 2023,negative,i dont understand the hype
Aug 23 2023,positive,the sheer originality and creative facets of the story and the action must be seen and charlize theron is a true badass

Aug 20 2023,positive,like a comic book come to life
Aug 16 2023,positive,mad max fury road is a mindbending thrill ride that feels like dune author frank herbert dropped acid and penned a contemporary action extravaganzasimply awesome the films relentless pace and imaginative worldbuilding leave audiences craving more of its adrenalinepumping energy however amidst the chaos the lack of chemistry between tom hardy and charlize theron is apparent and reading about their rumored offscreen discord adds a layer of intrigue to this explosive cinematic experience
Aug 15 2023,positive,one of the best theatre experiences of my life i almost immediately knew no home viewing could ever compare and i am grateful for having gone to see it this film is an actionpacked joyride from start to finish it is easy for franchises to fall short but fury road raises the bar to a new level
Aug 11 2023,positive,best action movie ever made with amazing shots characters universe ambiention and music this is a must see
Aug 10 2023,positive,i love this movie so much because it highlights how the world is like after a apocalyptic event it shows how humans adapt and how evil people can be it also displays the consequences of people all being in a sort of cult      i enjoyed it so much though i wish it would have shown more of a background on the wives i also wished it didnt kill off nux i truly saw a character redemption for him
Aug 10 2023,positive,one of the most entertainment and action packed post apocalyptic adventure that never feels like a snore 910
Aug 6 2023,positive,might be the best action movie ever made besides the opening narration and some quick plot starters the entire movie is one continuous twohourlong car chase across the lovely wasteland while watching you are completely transported to a new world and can see and feel the real stunt work the apocalyptic vehicles and you are just left to marvel at it all and live on the edge of your seat in the process its impeccably shot and edited and scored and the main protagonists in charlize theron imperator furiosa and tom hardy max rockatansky are just a badass pair you get the feeling george miller did everything he ever wanted in a mad max film with his imagination and love and maybe ended up making the best actionchase movie of all time    top genres  action adventure sci fi thriller fictionnonfiction  fiction runtime  200    genres rating action  10 adventure  10 sci fi  8 thriller  8    genre average score 9 directing 9 cinematographylighting 10 storynarrative 10 structure 9 dialogue 10 scoremusic 10 editing 10 acting 10 characterization 10 mise en scènevisual design 10 visual effects 10 costumesmakeup 10 lasting impact 10 originality 10    overall 927 467 rt     setting conflict character dialogue theme plot and climax a    audience engagement do you feel runtime no
Aug 3 2023,positive,some of the best action sequences put to the big screen are found in this movie the visuals and costumes are stunning and impossible to take your eyes off of the story is fun but not very deep or enthralling but thats not what you want to look for in this film
Jul 31 2023,negative,the worst film ive ever watched boring and horrible storyline
Jul 30 2023,positive,the film has a touch similar to zack snyders works but with greater cinematic maturity its a seventhart wonder with electrifying scenes and deep performances i dare say that it is somewhat feminist which i like very much i had the opportunity to see it recently in black and white and i was pleasantly surprised what a show
Jul 30 2023,positive,this is one of the best movies ive seen in the past 10 years
Jul 27 2023,positive,very far from the classic mad max the actor tom hardy was very good as max but the enviroment and story was horrible a lot of action ok cant disagree but unfortunelly i cannot recommend this movie could be a lot better
Jul 25 2023,positive,this movie its a lesson on cinematography and editing for action movies it is just masterful crafted
Jul 24 2023,positive,total insanity from start to finish awesome
Jul 24 2023,positive,a gripping visually stunning and laconic masterpiece
Jul 23 2023,positive,an average day in america
Jul 23 2023,negative,i would give this movie 0 stars if i could i wish it was never made so boring and whenever a character died i did not even care infact i wish every character in that movie died so i could finish it i had more enjoyment watching a clock change time than watch this moviei can describe this movie in 3 words trashy dusty nasty if you want to watch a movie about cars than watch fast and furius its dookie  the camrea angles wore horrible if you have bought this 20 doller movie i am sorry for you the worst part is that it costed 15461851 million to make somone could have used that for somthing good but no they used it for this horrible movie  the acting is cheesy and the script is as good as a baby talking into a microphone they filming looks like it is filmed from a dusty windsheild making a nasty looking film too i think you could have guesed that this movie sucks cause of its boxoffice making only 1300 i could make from a year of working at subway  every one tells me that this is a masterpeice but it is pure rotten eggs on a stick out of all movies that could have been made you hade to rip off of fast and furrius a real movie why could they have not made a movie about space or trains they made another poorly made ripof    3 do 2 not 1 watch
Jul 21 2023,positive,perhaps one of the best executed movies of all time very rare that a movie is able to be a visual feast great directing and practical effects
Jul 21 2023,positive,pure visual action mastery
Jul 18 2023,positive,how does this have an rt audience rating under 90    dont watch this if you plan on sleeping in the next 48 hours cause youll be too freakin pumped
Jul 11 2023,positive,the greatest action film ever made period
Jul 10 2023,positive,a blessed hellride from start to finish
Jul 7 2023,positive,the best action movie out there  it gives us visual thrills and momentous sequences without losing any of the flair or heart throughout a huge step up from the original mad max trilogy as well
Jul 5 2023,positive,gritty wellwritten wellcharacterized smartly designed and adventurously weird
Jun 28 2023,positive,while this movie may not be everyones cup of tea this is an action movie masterpiece in every way so much effort was put into the creation of the cars characters the music the wasteland not a scene felt wasted in any manner it just starts and gets straight to the point its amazing how they created every vehicle in this movie as well the effort matches the movie every actor and actress played their roles to the upmost of their ability amazing watch it
Jun 25 2023,positive,this movie is a masterpiece  george miller is the goat greatest of all time im looking forward eagerly to the prequel furiosa
Jun 19 2023,positive,one of the best movies of 2015 and one of the best action movies in years  george miller has given us an adrenaline fuelled nonstop dose of mayhem and action that is arguably better than the original
Jun 18 2023,neutral,good movie nice performances but nothing over the top the movie could easily be called george fury road and still be that movie what i mean is that they should leave max the character and introduce another one it was more of an action movie rather than a tense fils like the previous 3 were  the bad thing is that they are not revisiting the characters that were already introduced in the old movies and make a prequel that would show their stories 
Jun 15 2023,positive,spoilers this apocalyptic fiction follows max a man coping with the death of his wife and child who is captured by a group of survivors more like lunatics loyal to the tyrannical immortan joe when furiosa takes joes five wives in the war rig to bring them east to their liberty max is dragged along in an insane adventure full of monster trucks explosions fire death bullets gas gas and more gas     this is peak fiction the apocalyptic desert that is depicted the design of the war machines and costumes the character arcs fire explosions scale its an actionfuelled masterpiece the world miller has crafted is so erratic chaotic and octane filled  its insane and beautiful a wasteland where humans treat gas like a god completely obsessed with badasslooking vehicles and meeting their death on the road i wanted more when the credits rolled more time to explore this eccentric world and its characters for lack of a better term the shit in this movie is strait up cool like look at the concept art for vehicles the costumes and the landscape  and tell me its not fucking cool the production design reminds me of blade runner not because it is at all similar but because it is visually striking unique imaginative and captivating they have created a world here which is not ours a fictional world with nuances and touches that make it wonderful to get lost in     it was essentially nonstop action for two hours and it never got old or boring just high stakes over and over and over the war rig was practically a character in itself and the battles moving at high speed will be forever etched in my mind two hours of strait action and i could have done with two more there was some very credible and satisfying character arcs here as well amidst the explosions nux is absolutely the most notable at the start of the film i hated this man and his people for their octane filled delusions of valhalla and blatant insanity but by the end i saw nux as a man who put his life on the line for who he now considers friends he escaped from the lies and oppression joe was feeding his people it was a powerful character transition and death maxs relationship with furiosa and the wives is a pleasure to see unravel and become somewhat friendly at the end too     one thing i really like about this film too is how it doesnt give you any exposition or explanation for the wasteland factions people and how they came to be at first i was confused i havent seen the originals but i came to realize that them not opening the film up with some expedited narration or exposition from the characters  makes it so much more intriguing and enthralling the creators dont owe first time watchers an explanation as theres tons of previous movies and lore and i like how we are not babied into this world but simply taken along for the ride     overall mad max combines masterfully imaginative production design world building characters and gas to create one of the best action films ive ever seen
Jun 11 2023,positive,a great reboot of mad max franchise with ideas of cars and trucks demonstrating through desert thrilling and keep you engaged with this action film until the end
Jun 9 2023,positive,in a visually stunning and consistently fastpaced action film character development occurs through the depiction of their nature decisions and behaviours no explanation or dialogue is required as every detail of each character and the environment already tells a complete story
Jun 5 2023,negative,okay  so which version did all the positive reviewers watch  it cant have been this one  the movies plot was lets drive into the desert and then drive back again oh and car chase crash fire stupid heavy metal guitar charlise theron some ugly dude being dystopian or something and  well thats it  i was bored
Jun 5 2023,positive,one of the only ideologically driven movies made in the last 8 years that actually manages to stay entertaining  its a bit of a circus ride but thats kind of what you want in a mad max movie no
May 24 2023,positive,mad max fury road is one of my favorite films ever experienced depicting action and violence of a deadly highspeed chase throughout the wastelands dealing with survival over humanity feminism and an antihero haunted by visions of his deceased loved ones
May 23 2023,neutral,i am aware that they had to recast max due to mel being old but it still felt sacrilegious they didnt need to make this movie it has its scenes that look cool especially the early chase scenes but max is largely a background character in a movie named after him
May 10 2023,positive,the world building is brisk and vast and the action is just stunning this ones a must  see
May 8 2023,positive,simple yet complex i struggle to find the right words for this film
May 3 2023,positive,this is my favourite fing movie of all time
Apr 30 2023,positive,best movie ever  perfect action movie
Apr 21 2023,negative,i really dont get it such a bad movie boring just pure violence no real story behind and have such a rating it is totally nonunderstandable so much bllsht
Apr 20 2023,positive,an extremely fastpaced and adrenalinepumping action movie that you cant take your eyes off of a great watch
Apr 11 2023,positive,its bloody gorgeous in cinematography action pacing editing acting what more could be said every shot in this movie could be a desktop background tell you what its definitely on my desktop background slideshow they knew what they wanted to do with this movie the passion seeps through the screen in the most testosterone filled way ive ever seen few say that the plots too basic and the lore isnt explained at all yeh and the film makers are leaving it up to interpretation their showing glimpses rather than telling all its like drawing on dotted lines to complete the drawing its why were shown glimpses of maxs past we dont fully know what happened but its up to us to put the pieces together it says a lot without showing too much throughout this entire movie what else can i say that hasnt already been said this is a perfect action movie the best of the 2010s in my opinion
Apr 10 2023,positive,entertaining movie that does the franchise justice
Apr 8 2023,positive,good visuals lift up what is otherwise a series of action sequences loosely tied together with an illdefined protagonist im aware that is appealing to some but id rather have clear motivation for the plot to be progressed opposed to grunting and mumbling
Apr 6 2023,positive,a magnificent visceral dystopian post apocalyptic dark beauty mad max 2 was argueably the post nuclear action drama pinnacle purely for the impact it made by literally spawning the genre it was often copied but ironically only ever equalled once and that was by this its as though the pinnacle of the genre was given a massive dose of steroids and told you said its mother was a whore a true snarling angry spiritual successor that surpasses everything before it in terms of sheer spectacle utterly magnificent and easily sets a new gold standard in terms of live action carnage the cast all do their jobs superbly theron layers her performance beautifully and hardy provides a near monosalabic worldweary yet expressively wide physical performance  wonderful very close to the top of my all time favourite films list and bang at the top for post armageddon dystopia treat yourself watch mad max 2 and then this for the ride of your life  oh what a day what a lovely day
Apr 5 2023,positive,mad mix is an entertaining movie that delivers on both the action and comedy fronts the storyline is good
Mar 26 2023,positive,tom hardy and charlize theron in postapocalyptyc australia  non stop gruesome action and despair whats not to like
Mar 11 2023,neutral,tocky on a saturday night
Mar 4 2023,negative,if you liked this movie you are dumb
Feb 21 2023,positive,i feel like mad max fury road will grow on me more as time progresses  i thoroughly enjoyed it and i have it at an 88100 but i think that upon one or two rewatches it could make me greatest of all time list
Feb 6 2023,positive,one of the best action movie
Jan 22 2023,positive,i didnt what to make of this movie after knowing this was made by the same director as the previous films this movie was strongly hyped and regarded highly but i wanted to see the original films first within ten minutes i realized something this isnt a sequel but a reboot with a new mad max like the daniel craig bond movies replaced the previous bond movies    a dystopian world that ran low on resources had led max rockatansky to become a once respectable lawman into a road warrior in a postapocalyptic world who gets caught up in a fight for his life captured and used for resources gets involved in a violent warlords attempt to reclaim his offspring in five innocent expecting women taken from his care by a vicious but courageous female general known as furiosa max escapes from the warlord only to run afoul of furiosas mission but slowly but steadily gain each others trust but the warlord will not give up until he obtains his offspring as furiosa and mad max take the fight to the warlord    i got to say i loved the previous mad max movies with all my heart and just as sean connery will always be james bond to me mel gibson will always be mad max tom hardy is fine but he doesnt have mels intensity and charisma the real star of this movie is charlize theron who is amazing as an amazoniantype character furiosa not as feral as i heard described but smart and brave as well as strong george miller should make more movies with her all things considered a good movie but not as great as the previous movies
Jan 16 2023,positive,mad max fury road has always been that one blockbuster of the last 10 years that just looked like something that isnt for me and boy was i wrong mad max fury road follows a group of unknown people of each other trying to find a way to fulfill hopes and dreams while i have not seen the original 3 movies the story is still really understandable however i must say i definitely was a bit lost the first 1015 minutes mad max fury road has some of the most impressive practical effects ever put to screen combine that was sublime vfx and you get some of the most gripping action ever while mad max fury road has build its reputation of being an action movie the movie certainly has so much more to offer storywise george miller his direction is fantastic very stylisch editing and colors but still remaining it grounded the movie has some top notch makeup and hairstyling score and incredible sound design and mixing mad max fury road is definitely one i will be revisiting in the future however then i am going to check the older movies out as well
Jan 12 2023,positive,its a crazy and grand movie mad max fury road the 4th one a 2015 australian postapocalyptic action film cowritten coproduced and directed by george miller  ao    this stars tom hardy as the leading character mad and also charlize theron as the brilliant actress

Jan 8 2023,positive,just recently watched it for the first time it kept replaying on one channel it was pretty good i know about the original mad max films but ive never watched one the entire way through it piqued my interest in the franchise as a whole so i would call that a success
Jan 7 2023,positive,absolutely phenomenal
Jan 2 2023,positive,a spectacular and innovative addition to the mad max franchise easily the best of them with its larger and more dramatic look and plot
Dec 23 2022,positive,my absolute favorite movie of all time from the first shot to the last it is a bizarre in all the best ways highoctane chase scene which also effectively portrays character motivation and real bonding between the leads the most amazing part of the film is that all the stunts are practical effects  not cgi of course the dust storm scene has cgi but the motorcycles the monster trucks the explosions the running back and forth on the bigrig all of is done as real stunts and they look great best action movie best chase film ever made just sit back and enjoy and dont worry about understanding the dialog there isnt any

Nov 24 2022,positive,this movie was the best movie ive ever seen honestly im still shocked at what i watched amazing plot amazing cast amazing music it was absolutely amazing from start to finish i was captivated i couldnt take my eyes of the screen
Nov 17 2022,positive,with tight direction and a fresh story fury road brings mad max back in what is its most wellcrafted exciting and magnificent installment that goes mad in its action and never gives up
Nov 3 2022,positive,max max fury road was a thunderously engaging film including nonstop action and stunning aesthetics but although the film had so much potential it ultimately fell short i wanted the movie to work so much but it couldnt deliver a proper story in the end this picture could be seen as what happens in a childs imagination after watching the book of eli the characters lack adequate motivations and are somewhat restricted by the script we know very little of their stories or how things came to be but if you care little for understanding a film and would rather watch skullcrushing nonstop action with stunning editing and lord of the rings level costume and set design this is the picture for you
Oct 23 2022,positive,best action movie in the past 20 years
Oct 23 2022,negative,worst of the franchise was mad max even in it
Sep 24 2022,positive,great reboot of mad max it worked because of the george millers top notch cinematography and the stellar all star cast tom hardy charlize theron zoe kravitz riley keough if you didnt get to see this movie in the theaters you definitely missed out on a masterpiece because miller created special visualaudio effects that only works in theater
Sep 18 2022,negative,a pointless movie lots of car wrecks and blood and failed attempts at artistry
Sep 16 2022,negative,big on stunts and effects weak on acting dialogue world or character building simply watch for the stunts but if you are looking for something interesting seek life elsewhere
Sep 8 2022,neutral,i truly dont understand the acclaim for this one there is little to no exploration of the struggle the world is going through at this time not does it even hesitate to explore into any of the characters backstories were just thrown into the plot very quickly with balls to the walls action from start to finish the action was top notch and the scenery of the desolate world was cool i just didnt connect to the characters or any aspect of the plot leaving this one ringing hollow for me
Sep 5 2022,positive,ive never once seen a movie a second time in theatre let alone usually watch any movie a second time at any point but i saw this movie four times in theatre and have continued watching it more times on the small screen  this movie is truly a masterpiece from some of the gnarliest most amazing car crashes and stunts to a postapocalyptic world with so much lore and history of how things are somehow told so well despite absolute minimal dialogue the imagery and cinematography and the feeling of genuinely being left almost exhausted at the end of the movie flooded with adrenaline from such a persistent intense engaging chase that really does keep you at the edge of your seat the entire time a true 1010
Aug 30 2022,positive,spechless one of the best movies of all time
Aug 27 2022,positive,possibly my favorite movie of all time could not recommend more highly
Aug 19 2022,negative,fury road was completely divorced from the movies that created the franchise they turned max into a weak supporting character and revised the story into a woke revisionist story that didnt fit in at all with the other 3 mad max movies    this movie would have been better if they created it as a stand alone movie without max the movie was a disappointment that seemed to have nothing to do with the others and i cant even consider it a sequel
Aug 17 2022,positive,great sequel to inception really enjoyed eames performance here gollum looks all grown up cat woman needs to learn how to load a gun my only criticism of this film
Aug 9 2022,positive,a masterpiece from start to finish a simple plot that tells a thousand stories stuntwork unparalleled if you like action even a little bit you have to see this movie this movie has zero flaws
Jul 30 2022,positive,how the original mad max might have looked with a big budget and modern technology action scenes are great sound design and visuals are a however the soundtrack is very unmemorable and i dont know if hardy works as max at least if you prefer the original version of the character
Jul 30 2022,positive,honestly when i saw the movies cover i was skeptical and when i fired it up on hbo it grabbed me from the very beginning     there was not a single moment of the movie where i was bored  i would totally recommend it
Jul 27 2022,neutral,sorry all  watch the original mad max movies with mel gibson insteadthey are much better than this charlize is good hardy is nonexistentand one long chase is a bit overkill road warrior is sooooooo much better
Jul 24 2022,positive,entertaining movie plot was mediocre but the action and characters got us through to the end the cast did a great job in their roles and delivered some good characters
Jul 18 2022,positive,tom hardy no doubt has a powerful presence but it seems that cherlize theron dominated the movie which puzzles me as to why the title mad max fury road it should have been called mad furiosa fury road hopefully tom hardy will do another sequel and it will be more about his character otherwise dont entitle the movie mad max hes amazing to watch and very entertaining but it seems to me he took a backseat in this one nothing against theron but now i can understand why there may have been some conflict between the two of them theron is an amazing performer but i was hoping to see more of hardy just my opinion kudos should go out to the rest of the cast though they were all wonderful and i can understand theron being frustrated making this movie because all i saw was desert and more desert i would have gone berserk however i would hope that mel gibson would be proud of hardy for what he was able to contribute to this movie
Jul 18 2022,negative,this movie was not as advertised  no real character development bad special effects and a huge bait and switch  people wanted a mad max movie not a charlie theron action movie  i cant believe this shit has such a high score on this site
Jul 17 2022,positive,premise and execution more ridiculous than waterworld but a very entertaining action movie if you dont think too hard about the australian coast being only max 667 hours away at 30 kmph 6810  not quite good but more than adequate
Jul 9 2022,positive,yeah this is better than cats
Jul 8 2022,positive,the acting was solid strong performances from everyone however it was sad to see the title character take a backseat in his own movie the movie should have been called furiosa
Jun 23 2022,positive,gorgeous visuals paired with nonstop action that was well choreographed its guaranteed to be a good time but nothing past that the acting is very mid as whilst its not bad theres nothing specially unique or memorable about it with even tom hardy admitting to not trying very hard during press conferences the action is of course the highlight and its full of unique and memorable moments just nothing that can redeem the pretty basic story of a point to point end goal as everything that arent fights or battles feel like exposition for the fights leading to the ending and any attempt at emotion feeling lost as it comes off as too forced and i just cant care much about the characters other than max and furiosa
Jun 14 2022,positive,as an audiovideo set piece it succeeds with great splendor  i applaud the method of storytelling using visuals and minor character dialog to explain things instead of railroading the viewer into forced storytelling where every single thing has to be spelled out  they leave things up to interpretation as more movies should  let people internalize things differently sometimes that can be more interesting and feels more personal  i feel strongly compelled to rebuy this movie in 4k the visuals were already fantastic in 1080p but i can only imagine in hdr  also this movie has some incredible atmos implementation dont skip this if youre a home theater enthusiast
Jun 10 2022,positive,charlize theron is amazing in the lead role and the movie keeps you at the edge of your screen right till the end direction is good and so is the writing
Jun 6 2022,negative,movie had absolutely no plot at all script was horrible and the acting was very bad i have no idea how there are this many good ratings for such a horrible movie
Jun 4 2022,positive,it was part way through when i recognized the form fury road is an opera  albeit without any singing the whole valhalla thing it was wagnerian with music used very effectively thoroughly enjoyable with some lovely moments of frisson
May 30 2022,positive,warning spoilers  tom hardy and charlize theron are two wonderful forces of nature bringing to life and into a hellish universe two characters who become classics from the beginning mel gibson gave us the first interpretation of the role but it took revisiting the material and finding a new actor to truly present what max is all about hardy is a jaded creation who exists to survive he has that hard look driven and with all of his priorities set to survival mode he recognizes that you cant sit still here and there is no sense in worrying if you want to live    he finds himself prisoner of a set deviantsmutants that plan on killing him for sport max soon finds himself in the middle of a car chase that will eclipse anything else you have seen before at first he observes everything around him as he is on the hood of vehicle which is the stuff nightmares are made of in the opening scenes he manages to go through something that could be describe as the place where hell touched earth with lighting storms sand storms wind storms and just about anything else that can be thrown at him he pulls through in what many less ambitious directors would have saved fr the final frames but in fury road this is just the beginning and in the hands of george miller a man who is around 70 years old we get what was just a promise in the previous films    the universe is fully developed with just about every hellish detail up on the screen every element coming together in almost a magical way for not much is spoken to allow a skilled director to extract emotions reactions and powerful images from what his camera captures a much impressive achievement when one considers the amount of spectacular moments throughout the entire film as i said before the opening scenes only serve as the launching pad of what will be recognized as many as unbelievable breathtaking and utterly satisfying    in this film vehicles will burn crash tumble fly and spit fire continuously and the drivers are not just ridicule caricatures like those in a recent release there is power disgust hate hunger envy and almost anything else you can think of emanating from everyone on the screen even the angelic wivesprisoners are not empty shells one can feel every emotion by letting millers sirens seduce and leads into total shock and admiration not believing that what we have seen is possible here cgi doesnt overpower and sterilize the content many action films suffer from a mismanagement of resources here miller works with what he knows best but he still uses cgi to increase the power of what one sees in this movie very little looks fake and nothing is sacrificing to reckless waste of money    miller has given us a film that captures the magic of moviemaking the realization of its power this is the masterpiece many dream of where nothing and no one is spared every penny is showcased one way or another there are no egos to satisfy just goals to achieve and these are accomplished miller should like others before him clean his favorite space at home in order to display whatever type of recognition he seriously deserves much has been made of a gimmicks recently birdman tried to blend the mania of a troubled mind with harsh realityand it sorely failed here is film which entertains never bores and certainly is able to mix intelligence the hells which some beings carry in their souls and the possibility that a future like maxs might not be that distant the film is not fantasy its the type of science fiction which shows the almost certain possibility of what might be coming    i never understood why some films had a certainly look but they lacked vision charm or anything remotely intelligent and the disappointment hurt no one will walk away from fury road because miller respects the audience understand that unless some is real and we are able to somehow relate the experience will be meaningless fury road combines the best of acting and craftsmanship its pure powerful and it delivers a visceral punch making the best use of everyone of our senses giving us an experience that feels fresh and visionary miller hasnt copied anyone instead he has set the bar high for many and maybe he will be that inspiration that will give many an idea of what it takes to make an almost perfect film something with much imagination and power something that is quite remarkable considering how hollywood has started cannibalizing its own classics andor surrendering to the desire to just mass produce movies here is a film that proves that its possible to dream even if the images are those who will make you wonder if hell is here on earth
May 24 2022,positive,great visuals and suspense  like all the madmax movies should be respect for people like george miller that stay true to their vision of an end result
May 18 2022,positive,it is one of the best action movies of all time beautifully shot minimal dialogue but still an emotional story unbelievable stunts it is definitely in the top 5 action movies ever and for me it is tied for 1 with terminator 2
May 12 2022,positive,masterpiece of cinema passage photography sound and many spectacular details
May 9 2022,positive,this is almost a perfect movie  it is over the top and accepts it yet still somehow stays serious  mad max knows what it is and doesnt try to be something different  visually amazing and a nice nod to the 80s movies while being its own thing  loved it
Apr 30 2022,positive,this movie has nonstop action but its stimulating energetic and never feels exhausting or monotonous the score is absolutely breathtaking in tone watch this one on a big screen with decent audio if you can
Apr 29 2022,positive,its really well made and any individual 20 minutes of it are great but its also kind of one long action scene and by the end its really hard to be at all invested  i probably should have broken this one into chunks and watched it over a few days i think thats what id recommend
Apr 28 2022,positive,an earnest and technically masterful postapocalyptic action film thats rich in themes and visuals
Apr 27 2022,positive,one of the lifetime
Apr 21 2022,positive,instant classic tom hardy is excellent and the rest of the cast are also all amazing wonderfully directed and shot
Apr 18 2022,positive,an action masterpiece there are a couple of parts during the high adrenalin moments where the cinematography and music are so spot on i actually tear up i still cant explain why but i know when something works it works
Apr 12 2022,positive,this movie is just gold action world building visuals acting sound track just an amazing must watch film
Apr 7 2022,positive,mad max delivers as an action movie but those calling it an instant classic need to calm down mad max is a visually imaginative pulsepounding spectacle but it certainly has none of the subtle all time great acting performances that made films like the godfather true film classics that appeal to nearly everyone mad max is unique enough to set itself apart from the usual action flick but the story isnt that great
Apr 3 2022,positive,the action alone is what makes this movie which is directed very pristinely for the most part it really slowed down in the middle but other than that it was entertaining while i couldnt get behind other characters as much and wasnt entirely on board with the universe and the craziness surrounding it i didnt feel like i needed to i still liked tom hardys character quite a bit though its one of the better action movies ive seen for sure
Apr 1 2022,positive,action action action this movie is just a gift that keeps on giving a masterpiece with so much rewatchability
Mar 24 2022,positive,there is a beauty to this movie that i keep coming back to an assurance that even a wasteland can be heartbreakingly beautiful that humanity can exist even in the most dire of circumstances civilization begins when we stop treating one another as things
Mar 22 2022,positive,probably the greatest action film of all time the film has great action a good story but its problem is development in its characters and its lack of back story
Mar 21 2022,positive,oh boy is this an acquired taste didnt much care for it after one viewing but after a rewatch it became quite apparent that this is an amazing film 95100
Mar 18 2022,negative,if you like nonstop action in the form of never ending chases fiery explosions savage killings and general mayhem mad max fury road is probably right up your alley  if you like movies with meticulously developed characters a compelling story and intelligent dialogue you should probably take a pass on george millers most recent installment in the franchise  the stunts and special effects are remarkable and much of the cinematography is excellent but the continual parade of bodies flying through the air vehicles exploding in balls of flame and characters mumbling incoherently grows repetitive after a short time making it an exhausting experience at best  despite the widespread praise thats been heaped on fury road its clearly not for all tastes
Mar 17 2022,positive,the style of this is incredible
Mar 11 2022,negative,i love tom hardy but even after watching it for the 4th time i dont understand whats happening
Mar 7 2022,positive,mad max fury road a critically acclaimed action film that not only breaks away from  standard genre norms but does a near flawless job the film uses theatrical mise en scene to create a completely unique over the top dystopian world
Mar 7 2022,positive,great movie tons of epic action and chase scenes fantastic and very well developed world building and some really good characters very well edited very good special effects and practical effects and some very realistically gritty fight scenes that are fun to watch
Mar 6 2022,negative,this movie is terrible script plot acting sound design action sequences are all awful im not getting that 2 12 hours of my life back
Mar 1 2022,positive,man oh man oh man what a actionpacked visually stunning ride this was you never had a chance to catch your breath for scene after scene this was a real shock to the system i had seen all the old mad max movies but this one went off like a supernova and keep eating up the screen my favorite unexpected character was the blind heavy metal guitarist flailing the desert during the pursuit with a wall of amps blasting out a battle soundtrack what a hoot now the film basically does a full circle  ending up where it started but what an audacious journey recommended but dont let your little kids watch this as it is ultraperverse violence throughout
Feb 25 2022,positive,greatest action movie ever made 
Feb 23 2022,positive,the opening monologue given to us by tom hardy is probably one of my top 5 moments in film history its so well written and beautifully delivered and it goes so well with whats actually happening on the screen what a great start to an even greater film    i think one of the most unique and intriguing things about mad max fury road as a whole is the way its filmed its beautifully shot but its very different from other movies theres times where itll speed up and while the dialogue is at normal speed the scene in the background is at 15x speed super unique and i love it    this cinematography good heavens im in love with the colors and the angles and the shaky effect gosh it is so visually pleasing when i first watched this i didnt quite have my directors eye as some might call it but upon rewatch im absolutely in love with the camerawork in every scene i cant get over this cinematography the colors are just so stunning especially when it switches from orange to blue so so great    the jumps and transitions between scenes is perfection the pacing overall is actually amazing and id say that this is the most intricately timed film ive seen which makes watching super enjoyable    im also in love with this score its at times rock music which gets you hyped but at other times its an orchestra playing a somber song perfectly split between exciting and devastating the music itself is extremely emotional and will bring you into what the characters are feeling whether it be excitement or trauma let me reiterate this the score is phenomenal theres simply no other word to describe it    an underrated part of this film are the vfx every time a car would blow up or blood would spill i was blown away by how real it looked you can tell a lot of time was spent focusing on the visual aspects but especially the visual effects    no one could direct this the way george miller did mad max fury road could only be written produced and directed by a mad man and george miller proved his worth arguably better than its predecessors fury road is revolutionary its a film that could bring you into the realm of film as it is perfect in near every aspect it will make you love cinematography will show you what a films score can really be provides a wonderful example of the different forms of acting and so much more i somehow forgot how good this film really is absolutely amazing 1010
Feb 12 2022,negative,honestly its one of the worst films ive ever seen
Feb 12 2022,positive,a movie full of details with an incredible costume and wonderful performances in addition the cinematographic work is the most impressive in this work
Feb 10 2022,positive,i love this movie by far the best mad max movie its violent tom hardy is great as max and immortam joe is a cool villain i loved this movie absolute must see
Jan 31 2022,positive,what sounded like a terrible idea ended up being an absolute masterpiece that topped even the road warrior
Jan 27 2022,positive,its amazing how this movie managed to surpass the old one this movie brought a new mad max universe with a postapocalyptic world more extreme than just people going crazy the new perspective of a world affected by nuclear devastation brought improvements to both the characters and the story
Jan 27 2022,positive,this movie was clearly a vehicle to introduce charlize theron as the next lead in the franchise otherwise why does her role exponentially supersede that of tom hardy as the titular character  is this a great action movie yes is it thrilling with great action sequences and effects most definitely  pitfalls are the less than stellar dialogue and the forgettable supporting characters    but i guess we dont watch action flicks for their stellar dialogue or storytelling  oh well it was at least entertaining
Jan 24 2022,positive,i dontt understand why this had a mediocre box office result cause the fast and furious franchise is so suscessful it just dosent make sense to me
Jan 20 2022,positive,visually stunning and technically advanced it is but i did not see much more than loud explosions and monster trucks in this film it is certainly not bad but i find it quite overrated
Jan 18 2022,positive,unpopular opinion i know but i still prefer the original three films   something was just missing somehow maybe this new one was too polished maybe its how softfaced tom hardy just doesnt come across as the max rockatansky we know from the originals i do want the franchise to continue but im not jazzed with the reboot so far    maybe a tv series could work pretty well
Jan 14 2022,positive,except for a few well and obvious set up for tom hardy and i thought this show was going to become tawdry but as i got into the movie i have to say that this was a very good chase movie with lots of explosions and a great ending  i must say this is the best of the mad max series thus my 4 star rating
Jan 10 2022,positive,like a lot of people i didnt really know what to expect with this reboot but also as with a lot of people i was pleasantly surprised     the visuals in this movie are very well done and more than compliment the setting of a postapocalyptical wasteland obviously taking the visual style of mad max 2 and giving it an enhancement with some borderlands vibes thrown in which im a big fan of    my only true peeve is that maxs character is rather flat but this is forgiven by the fact we get some great character development with furiosa and nux    also the high octane fight scene that consumes majority of the film despite being very well shot does tend to make one start to feel like zoning out but to be honest i think thats just a me thing
Jan 10 2022,negative,one of the worst movies ive ever seen  it has nothing to do with mad max and has zero story line  i think the screenwriters dropped acid before they wrote this pathetic script
Jan 3 2022,positive,a fun and surprisingly exciting narrative that has only a few minor flaws particularly with its scope and sometimes lessexplained side characters fury road made a real impact probably much greater than the original mad max but even for its impact there are definite points near the end where youll start to ask to get off the ride
Dec 30 2021,positive,mad max fury road is basically a 2hour long action scene this movie barely ever stops the plot is always advancing forward all the action scenes are insane unique and exciting the story itself is also interesting and i found myself rooting for the protagonists and i really liked how all the characters very useful and were helping each other the damsel in distress trope has been subversed excellently
Dec 27 2021,positive,visually cripping an absolute orgy of color and action  and a clinic in world building and storytelling through action
Dec 26 2021,negative,struggled to tell a compelling story seems like kind of a half hearted excuse to try a mad max installment with more current cutting edge special effects
Dec 26 2021,positive,best action movie of all time imagine that movie behind black phanter americans please do not watch a  movie again just leave us alone
Dec 24 2021,positive,straight up action movie if there ever was one for a bit of the movie i was distracted by how this connects to the other movies but then i just didnt care didnt really pay attention to the plot except to understand what was going on stunts and visuals were the best ive seen in awhile especially if most were actually practical and not cg very entertaining i would rent it for 3 onceyr to watch it
Dec 23 2021,negative,i have never been this disappointed in a film for which i had expected so little this film hamhandedly delivers halfbaked social and political commentary where the main character speaks all of about five words and the action seems like it was composed by a pubertycrazed twelve year old boy on cocaine copious amounts of cocaine i found myself somewhere between indignant anger and hysterical laughter as i watched this train wreck of a movie that people were lauding as an artistic masterpiece i am afraid that watching this film may have more adverse effects on cognitive development than a year drinking flint michigan tap water
Dec 12 2021,positive,this movie is a work of art every frame every shot every action scene its a freaking work of art this should be presented in art schools on how to make action movies the editing is flawless
Dec 12 2021,positive,i live i die i live again    mad max fury road 2015 directed by george miller is a postapocalyptic sciencefiction masterpiece a truly amazing cinematic achievement    it feels like george miller has been studying for this piece of art since the release of mad max beyond thunderdome1985 and finally mastered how to make the perfect mad max movie    a modern epic that is completely flawless from the technical standpoint a movie to watch in the cinema a dazzling cinematography with some of the most beautifully crafted shots in cinema history a score that is extremely effective and drags you down to the fury road an editing that is sent from above and that made this picture have some of the best action sequences of all time    a fantastic screenplay that shows how passionate miller is about this apocalyptic world a very effective and emotional way of telling an epic story    mad max fury road is one of the best movies of the 21st century and takes part in the list of my favorite action movies of all time    im gonna die im gonna die historic on fury road
Dec 10 2021,positive,a classic that will be handed down to generations
Dec 7 2021,positive,an epic wonderfully acted action packed masterpiece with some of the best most intense scenes and music i have ever seen loved every minute
Dec 6 2021,positive,after the saga endured a long hiatus mad max fury road returns for a roller coaster ride through the deserts of postapocalyptic australia the combination of explosive action sequences and an impeccable soundtrack compensates for a rather simplistic plot charlize theron delivers a headstrong disposition as a war captain who goes awol with five female slaves eventually joining max in their desperate attempt to escape the thumb of a tyrannical dictator who rules over the wasteland her role proves equally substantial to her male counterpart a conservative amount of cgi in favor of practical effects contributes to the engaging visuals newcomers to the franchise are pardoned since the film is essentially a reboot while catering to oldschool fans with a few carryovers from the original trilogy it only gets better with each viewing
Nov 26 2021,positive,the mad max franchise is one of great creativity and amazing action and this new sequel continues that wonderful trend mad max fury road is absolutely amazing minimal dialogue but actions speak louder than words for this film
Nov 21 2021,positive,singlehandedly reinvents the action movie as an art form its really really good
Nov 15 2021,positive,smells like engine gasoline and heat the best action movie of all time
Nov 11 2021,positive,one of my absolute favorite action movies the cinematography was on another level and the fact that most of the movie was practical effects blows my mind the fact that they took a franchise that was always about the macho man and bringing the story of the brides and furiosa into the mix was brilliant
Nov 11 2021,positive,truly a cinematic experience
Oct 26 2021,positive,worth a watch for the gonzo practical action even though the plot is pretty much nonexistent
Oct 16 2021,positive,im not sure if its the greatest action movie ever but its certainly in the conversation 
Oct 4 2021,positive,quite possibly the greatest action film of all time fury road sprints into action and never stops everyone and everything performing at their absolute peak from the impeccable cast to the larger than life set pieces to the jawdropping practical effects fury road is decidedly opposed to the idea of wasting anyones time an indisputed masterpiece this is the playbook by which other films will be made and the new standard by which other films will be judged
Oct 4 2021,positive,i absolutely loved this film a must see i went by in a flash great great film and the acting omg and the editing was great and the cinematography he is a really good director
Sep 29 2021,positive,the road warrior is one of the most iconic films of the 20th century  making a subsequent film without mel gibson 40 years later was a gamble for george miller it is not the road warrior but it is good  tom hardy is good as max but oddly a second player to charlize therons lead character she is bold and good as the female leader rescuing the wives of the central cult like villain  she is clearly the 21st century female embodiment of the original maxthis is evidenced by her early mimic of the road warrior dialogue  much of this post apocalyptic wasteland is familiar and brutal   the madness violence scarcity and perversity are all out of millers universe the cinematography is spotty at times and too frenetic for my taste  the vehicular chases and related effects are stunning  the theme of female empowerment is great  worth the roller coaster ride
Sep 26 2021,positive,stylistic actionpacked and over the top mad max fury road is awesome and the soundtrack is so so good
Sep 24 2021,positive,outstanding movie very rewatchable i have watched this movie 4 times and still love it it is a little strange admittedly but why not strange is good as strange is different it really brings you into it especially the ending it makes you wanna watch the next one right then an there in my top 10 movies of all time
Sep 16 2021,positive,freaking outstanding mad max fury road is up there with terminator 2 and the matrix as some of the best action movies ever made for so many reasons first of all this is one of the most visually stunning movies ever made they somehow managed to make a desert incredibly appealing and the whole movie is filled with so many beautiful colors and jaw dropping cinematography its a work of art the combined use of practical effects and cgi worked wonder and the action is chef kiss its a non stop thrill ride thats super intense makes you feel tension for the characters filled with incredible stunt work and exceptional editing that makes the action feel real alive like youre there and thats another perfect thing about this movie it feels lioe youre in a post apocalyptic world with the lack of nature women being used as sex objects and normal humand trying to survive with cult groups and its subtle with it it shows us the world making for some incredible visual storytelling a
Sep 13 2021,positive,not as good as the original great production but the story has little point just a movie to pass the time as far as im concerned
Sep 12 2021,positive,like mad max 2 in its time fury road brings back in a huge way the post apocalypse world like weve never seen before every character dialogue and scene is masterfully done the actors where spot on and the best part no zombies
Sep 7 2021,positive,brilliant a must watch
Aug 24 2021,positive,five stars naturally even with multiple viewings mad max never ceases to entertain and amaze great cinematography direction acting action worldbuilding writing everything who knew a 2 hour car chase through the desert could be such a bananasengaging story
Aug 20 2021,positive,the stunts choreography effects set design and costume design more than make up for the minimal story here charlize theron is excellent and tom hardy is fine not that he had a lot to work with it takes its simple premise and executes it nearly flawlessly and i love all of the female empowerment throughout like yeah im completely sold that a dozen badass women are gonna come destroy capitalism and save the world im all for it lets go already  this movie is like watching olympic gymnasts try to murder each other which is basically exactly what it is its extremely actionheavy but all of the choreography is so unique and welldone that its incredibly engaging the battles between characters are ridiculous and impractical but the movie makes the world feel alien enough that it doesnt stand out as distracting just as freaking awesome the violence is brutal but ohsosatisfying the set pieces are all really impressive and each location feels different despite having a fairly consistent desert backdrop  it has a few cliches like how the main characters refuse to die despite having concussions and broken bones that could have killed them dozens of times over injuries also seem to heal themselves in a matter of minutes allowing our heroes to continue the fight when they should be immobilized at best this takes away some of the gritty realism which sounds ridiculous for this movie i know and ultimately hampers a bit of the experience also as much as i appreciate the practical effects and lack of cgi the occasional moments of cgi feel very out of place  that being said i still love this movie and the visuals will never fail to amaze me ive never even seen any of the original mad max films but i just might have to go back and check them out
Aug 19 2021,positive,a visually stunning postapocalyptic masterpiece and one of the greatest action films of all time
Aug 11 2021,positive,absolute masterclass of action movie setting a bar so high to show how modern action movies are done
Aug 10 2021,positive,how did they make this movie its just awesome
Aug 9 2021,positive,it drives up a deadend road and uturns back again but it looks pretty cool
Aug 5 2021,positive,tom hardy and charlize theron are badass in the movie
Jul 30 2021,positive,awesome movie with great special effects good storyline amazing actors and insane action it also has good antagonists with two side ones and one main antagonist
Jul 25 2021,positive,with a good soundtrack incredible scenery and a rounded script mad max manages to get everything he proposes right and still contains good performances 1010
Jul 25 2021,positive,so much fun lots of action just waiting for that sequel
Jul 21 2021,positive,nice choreographies images and sound i guess thats all
Jul 14 2021,positive,the music the action the charactereverything about this movie is a masterpiece
Jul 12 2021,positive,a nearperfect film more films that are this insanely creative and simply insane with real messages to boot need to be made
Jul 11 2021,positive,one of my all time favorites 
Jul 10 2021,positive,this cinematic masterpiece really defied the laws of what makes a movie good with a fairly basic plot and not a complicated storyline it left room for some incredible movie sequences with amazing car chases and action  the cinematic experience of all the incredible colors and action was amazing this will probably leave you dazed after you watch it some of the scenes are so mindblowing
Jul 6 2021,positive,this tried to kickstart a genre but unfortunately failed that being said its one of my favorite movies of all time
Jul 3 2021,positive,the best of the franchise of cos 20 years apart with filmmaking technology advancement  much nicer hotwheels haha rev head  war boy nice pure 2hours of full throttle adrenaline death wish with such  toprated superstars lineup so much expectations  it didnt disappointed a bit missfiring shotgun still appears after all this time wahahaha max oh max
Jul 2 2021,negative,i am having a hard time understanding the ratings for this movie  i found it difficult to even finish watching it was just monotonous action zero character exposition and pretty terrible acting by tom hardy who i normally like
Jun 27 2021,positive,a post apocalyptic movie reboot done right charlize theron and tom hardy were excellent in their works
Jun 23 2021,positive,while obviously heavily inspired by mad max 2 a previous entry in the series it stands well as its own stand alone story it has considerable better action and a better script than any of the previous movies in the franchise and is with out a doubt one of the greatest action movies ever made unlike any of the previous mad max films this one also has a black and white which makes this film even more unique and in many ways it improves the overall experience
Jun 20 2021,positive,its a full pop corn actionadventure entertainer
Jun 18 2021,positive,death to the patriarchy
Jun 13 2021,positive,62100 first things first this movie is very metal and very steampunk so if youre not into that youre not going to like this movie the main thing i didnt like about fury road is that there are parts that are weird and uncomfortable just for the sake of being weird and uncomfortable the people in this movie are so detached from humanity yet the movie never explained how humans wavered so far in the first place also this movie is predictable especially the third act this film has an interesting premise and does a good job world building but most of the movie is just car chase after car chase after car chase when the actors and actresses are able to do their thing that is when this movie is at its best even though we dont get much of it as an action movie it does what action movies are supposed to do in terms of action sequences but it was not my cup of tea and im sure im not the only one who thinks this way
Jun 10 2021,negative,horrible movie by itself  worse movie when you compared to the original mel gibson trilogy  the movie is simply a bigbudget amalgam of the originals  breeders  gasoline from the road warrior  master from thunderdome  immortan joe  aunty entity  the humungus  nux  the feral kid  jedediah  motorcycle gang  toecutter  goose   the only surprise is that imperator furiosa so did not die like jessie  warrior woman  the storyline is canned  the plot is ridiculous  the nonsequiturs are innumerous  too bad charlize theron and tom hardy signed up for this version of kingdom of the crystal skull
Jun 3 2021,positive,such gorgeous chaos
May 29 2021,positive,powerful vicious restless
May 28 2021,positive,its just pure eyecandy and sound experience so in terms of testing your home cinema system great very entertaining popcorn flick but the story men  very uninspiring and that really hurts the otherwise excellent movie
May 27 2021,positive,i dont usually like gory action movies but the stunning visuals and emotional depth of mad max fury road have earned it a permanent spot on my list of favorite movies
May 23 2021,positive,best action movie of all time
May 18 2021,positive,witness me    its been awhile since i watched this movie and since its on hbo max i wanted to relive it    and i loved this movie one of the most fun entertaining and spectacular action movies that i have ever watched i was in awe at how they were able to film these long sequences of car chase in the desert     the first half was unrelenting two major action sequences made for an intense and fastmoving experience the editing that focused on the face of the characters created the sense of intensity and craziness the second half was pretty much the same thing and i was still amazed at the incredible work put into these sequences     my only problem was that at the middle the movie slowed down which was fine initially however i felt it took a bit too long i honestly didnt care much for the characters and just wanted the action therefore the emotion wasnt too much there     overall one of the best and relentless action movies that entertaining me from the start to finish it was quite a fury road indeed 910
May 11 2021,negative,absolutely terrible what could you possibly like about this movie
May 11 2021,positive,its a good movie hell its a great movie    but it isnt mad max mad max went mad because of his wife and sons slaughter in the australian outback this one is just crazy its wearing a mask it does not need and simply took the name so it could get traction demeaning but ok     it makes me a bit sad that this wasnt a pickup of the trilogy but simply a reboot this max has no past to me no reasoning i could replace him with anyone and not feel different     that being said its a great dystopian film there are so many good parts and so many interesting implications i do recommend it
May 4 2021,negative,sure fury road is boldly beautiful adds a nice feminine angle to the storyline and includes all the postapocalyptic trademarks that i expected as an og fan of the original trilogy but i cant help thinking for a film that was supposed to take the action genre to even greater heights it really never strayed far from the standard action fare ill take a simple story and interesting characters over stunning visuals every time
May 3 2021,positive,action story heart everything is in abundance
May 2 2021,positive,breathtaking scenery and action sequences one of the most flawless action films created with cinematography that emerges its viewer into the films dystopian landscape
Apr 26 2021,negative,i cannot understand why this movie has a so high rating  there is no story there is no consinstance it it just people fighting and cars exploding while driving a stupid truck in the worst way they could possibly do
Apr 16 2021,positive,if you get a chance to watch this masterpiece in the movie theater do it one of the greatest action movies ever made
Apr 15 2021,negative,awful movie unless youre the type of person who likes cheesy cgi bad acting and hackneyed storyline oh wait they have a really long desert car chase scene with fake cgi explosions cool watch the original instead
Apr 12 2021,positive,the movie was ok bad cgi sometimes the end sucked in my opinion i like the fast paced scenes
Apr 9 2021,positive,the best action movie ever made
Apr 9 2021,positive,an action masterpiece unique designs and ideas 
Apr 7 2021,positive,rating a  director george miller   mad max fury road is one of those films were you literally cant look away cause there just is to much in every frame that you could miss tom hardy and charlize theron lead the ensemble cast and the two of them have an amazing chemistry i gotta say that nicholas hoult delivered an breakthrough performance the screenplay is great  unlike in many other blockbusters  and millers direction is even better there definitely has to be props to the stunt team too cause what they did is nothing but brilliant the sound costumes production design and editing were really great too but i think the 6 academy awards speak for themselves
Apr 6 2021,negative,this was so tedious ive tried to watch it twice i just cant get through it
Apr 5 2021,positive,amazing movie the production is very well done and the acting is superb
Apr 3 2021,positive,a little slow at first but holy cow were the fight scenes intense  the visuals as well as the mixing was stunning  you dont really need to know much of what the franchise was about to enjoy this movie
Mar 29 2021,positive,mayor the film is action from start to finish without losing a beat in no time the script is great the photography is stunning the direction is perfect and the performances are to be admired mad max estrada from fury is a practically perfect film 
Mar 28 2021,positive,it may take someone with modern film taste to appreciate but after a few revisits and reflection youll realize that the feminism visuals thrills and story deserve at the praise it gets
Mar 26 2021,positive,watch it in black and white itll blow you away
Mar 22 2021,positive,really pleasantly surprised at this movie the supporting cast really saves this movie because other than max looking and pulling off some christopher lambart looks and body language his character development was rather weak compared to the others thats ok though because you are a mad max fan that knows this mans story inside out otherwise its the wheel for you you know the rule  bust a deal face the wheel    witness meeeee
Mar 21 2021,positive,great action settled in a dystopian world you must love and fear for its madness
Mar 19 2021,positive,glorious spectacle far greater than anything that came before it in the mad max series
Mar 17 2021,positive,this is one of the best movies ever in history and futer made  mad max fury road is fck masterpiece
Mar 14 2021,positive,max mad fury road is brilliant the way it recreates and updates the post apocalyptic world from the original films is spectacular and its new story and characters make it stand out in ways the originals did not the camera shots are thoughtful and unique the colors are bright and genuine to life and along with the nonstop action pull the viewer in making you feel like youre right there with the characters on screen even if youre not a fan of action movies the sheer artistry of max max fury road will demand your full attention and make your jaw drop all reboots should be this great  keep your fingers crossed for a sequel because you will want to see more and hopefully it will have the same actors because recasting the actors destroys a films contiunity and its characters integrity and appeal
Mar 10 2021,positive,it is the word action translated into film language the truly good history behind the raw universe of george miller 1010
Mar 8 2021,positive,truly a masterpiece
Mar 5 2021,positive,a true accomplishment of unforgettable cinematic action experience a simple story glows and becomes one to follow among the barren dusty and helpless world were thrown into comes something substantial and once you dust yourself off only a big grasp of air will return you back from the edge of your seat 
Mar 3 2021,neutral,i found it mildly interesting but by the end i was bored
Mar 3 2021,positive,i have seen this movie many times it is a very interesting movie  
Feb 24 2021,positive,this movie is great one of the best action movies
Feb 23 2021,positive,this films is great its one of the best action films ive ever seen the film is an absolute blast and its just genuinely fantastic
Feb 22 2021,positive,this is an action packed thrill ride full of explosions and tense moments you can really tell the use of practical effects in comparison to visual ones it also had a killer soundtrack everytime i watch this movie i enjoy it it has amazing rewatchabilty
Feb 19 2021,positive,the movie is ok but tom hardys performance is kinda shitty
Feb 13 2021,positive,awesome worth a rewatch 3rd watch 21321
Feb 11 2021,negative,dont get mad but i thought this movie kinda sucked yes the action was pretty great and the reasons behind some of the characters decisions are actually really well thought out and believable but besides that the rest of the movie sucked there was no drama the acting was pretty bad except nicholas hoult the way the characters were sped up was both cringey and unsatisfying and the movie had like zero levity like cant someone spit out a joke for once literally everyone is serious af and its a fn mad max movie anyways this movie felt bland in literally everything except the action and its cool if you like this movie just for the action but it just isnt my cup of tea
Feb 9 2021,positive,this film still hits well after all these years whether your watching it in color on a date at a theatre or black  chrome at home  the cinematography  the pace the cuts the story the explosions the sex and zest  are all to die for this is what hollywood movies are made of and for   if you can get your hands on it see the black  chrome silent cut  not available through streaming i learned the hard way i caught an abridged version on youtube instead as i decided to retread down fury road far away from my 1st viewing at the magic johnson theater and still loved every second of my experience    audiomackcomcvrthebard
Jan 30 2021,positive,this is a solid action movie with some well done special effects and a few very beautiful landscape shots that really help create the dystopian world the movie is set in the casting was great and what emotion there was felt genuine my biggest issue with this movie was there is no explanation of back story i went into this movie having not seen any previous mad max movies and the movie plays out as if the audience is already well aware of maxs backstory including a sub plot with a hallucination of a girl which i still dont get since the last movie in the series came out in 1985 i was hoping that backstory would be reestablished seriously a 510 minute flash back at the beginning of the movie wouldve been awesome instead you are dropped into the movie and it took 20 minutes before i was really hooked i feel that one piece alone wouldve helped my movie experience incredibly all that aside its was still a great movie and i look forward to the next installment i will probably go back and watch the old ones as well if you are planning on watching this movie it is very well worth it but i suggest you try to get the backstory first
Jan 28 2021,positive,a theatre circus act of a movie overly numerous and stretched poignancies implausablability chartoonish characters neverending chase scenes debauched nuances and unbelievable premises mean this is a film that is a spectacle of how spectacular you can make something not a film with a story
Jan 27 2021,positive,great antihero movie
Jan 24 2021,positive,this is a classic it pays respect to the main character the scenes are beautiful and flow well the film keeps you watching and theres never a dull moment this is how you do a female lead she is strong but not flawless and does not win every fight she is the opposite of a mary sue which is how it should be done
Jan 23 2021,positive,a classic story about overthrowing old and overreaching power in a beautiful dystopian world highly recommended
Jan 18 2021,negative,underneath the exaggerated punk fabrications and childish stunts a banal story tries to make it over the line i drifted in and drifted out much like i do spending 2 hours on our ride on mower doing the back paddock might have worked better as an exhibition of stills photos but i  was encouraged by reviews that hurled epic postapocalyptic cinematic art visceral i would gladly have done with less of those for something interesting and emotional engaging characters that said heroes and heroines were very attractive and villains not diesel panto
Jan 12 2021,positive,probably the greatest action movie of all time
Jan 10 2021,positive,visually stunning i wish it had a little more plot and backstory on some of the characters otherwise mesmerizing 
Jan 8 2021,positive,fury road might be the best postapocalyptic action film ever made you dont get a break for at least an hour and its not enough of one to catch your breath its packed with style relentlessly bleak brutal and highoctane with sparse and bizarre dialog like the original mad max but i think the story concept is more interesting excellent costumes score and sound design stunts characters direction acting editing props vehicles cinematography and scenery i think ive watched it at least once every year since it came out and i cant think of anything that would make it better i wish i had seen it in a theater
Jan 8 2021,positive,fury road is one of the best action movies ever made masterpiece
Jan 3 2021,positive,i thought it was a masterpiece epic fightbattle scenes especially the opening chase brilliant cinematography
Jan 2 2021,positive,017 laughsmin     257 of movie spent tense     a high octane thrill ride set in a dystopian future ravaged by climate change and patriarchy
Dec 27 2020,positive,best action movie of all time period
Dec 27 2020,positive,those epic scenarios took a terrific cinematography that has also a nice story to tell with amazing action scenes and soundtracks
Dec 23 2020,negative,love the original mad max but i dont understand why people like this i know there is nuance story to it and i dont doubt that at all but the action i cannot understand why people praise it so much max does barley any fighting at all compared to the original 3 and the only action that is in it is people chucking explosive spears at cars thats it maybe 1 scene with max using his shotgun or furiosa using a pistol or something basically the film is drive to point a get spears chucked at them reach point b realise they got to go back to point a drives back to point a gets hit by more spears reaches point a again frees people there ya go thats the film     and i love the actors and actresses in this film but max isnt max anymore he just grunts and nods and has zero character fanboys will say he doesnt say much in the originals but if you watch them again you will see not only are you wrong but there is so much story to him in the originals that even his grunts or nods mean a lot more in those films then the words max finally gets to utter in this film tom hardy could be a great successor to mel gibson but the writing of the character ruined it no longer is he the angry but smart and kind of charismatic loner from the first film now he is just a moody guy that just does things
Dec 21 2020,positive,pretty cool it felt the classic mad max feel the action was good the costumes were really good but its not a masterpiece just an awesome movie
Dec 18 2020,positive,tom hardy is an absolute tank this movie is nonstop action and keeps everyone in suspense it is an absolute mustsee for everyone over 14
Dec 16 2020,positive,we were due for another better mad max film and we sure got it
Dec 11 2020,positive,one of the best action movies of all time
Dec 10 2020,positive,the first parts of it were a little disinteresting to me but overall it was cool lots of fantastic parts once it really got rolling and i really liked the plot
Dec 7 2020,positive,this is one of the most out of control action films ive ever seen it offers a unique vision of the future if it was on a lot of sugar and watched way too many fast and furious movies it is fun exciting and coins the term motor combat
Dec 2 2020,positive,nothing less than the best action movie ive ever seen
Dec 1 2020,positive,the best movie ive seen in years everything in this film was done perfectly what more can i say 
Nov 30 2020,positive,i genuinely thought i was going to have a heart attack i have never been so stressed out nonstop action that was never exhausting
Nov 26 2020,negative,a lame script and tired action tropes power this stinker  two stars cuz its visual style hit its mark perfectly but the rest is a pretty rough watch
Nov 21 2020,positive,for all its admirable production design and cinematography the whole experience ended up being a little underwhelming for me
Nov 15 2020,positive,top 5 action movies of all time and i think it might be my favorite of all time absolutely perfect cant explain it you just gotta watch it
Oct 22 2020,neutral,its a decent movie but it should have been its own thing it capitalizes on a known title poorly to tell a bare bones story its visually interesting  has some cool moments but overall seems like a mismanaged idea
Oct 21 2020,positive,would not recommend watching with your mother  great practical action compelling story and characters interesting world gratuitous with the violence at times
Oct 18 2020,positive,this movie is just great the story doesnt make any sense but thats also just adds to the fun of watching this movie it also makes me laugh when i just think of how filming this movie must have been because almost nothing in this movie was made with a computer
Oct 11 2020,positive,fun movie good effects charlize theron is excellent
Oct 10 2020,positive,visually appealing with a good cast and acting but excessive focus on action over plot  they certainly accomplish the creation of a dystopian world that is interesting  the vehicles the citadel and the mechanics of things are impressive  to me you just have this set of interesting characters that you dont know really anything about so you dont fully appreciate their actions and motivations  you dont get a chance to get emotionally involved because its a stranger you just met  i would have preferred the film to be split over 23 individual films in more of a peter jackson format of developing the characters over time but shot at once
Oct 1 2020,positive,millers attempt to not focus on the titular character but to the subsequent feminism theme surprisingly works for the undeniably wellcrafted action sequences
Sep 21 2020,positive,potent technical stunning wild these are some adjectives that describe this feature mad max fury road is a complete chaos orchestrated by human beings in their most ambiguous insanity in a postapocalyptic world george miller created an extremely fascinating perverse and brutal work portraying a world where people are at their emotional physical and especially mental limits the first feature 1979s mad max came with a somewhat daring proposal where the focus would be on unbridled action in an australia where the streets were taken by people and their vehicles in a state of madness and at the same time that max played by mel gibson a police officer respected by his comrades and the city where he works sees himself with his ideals coming to the fore when he goes through an experience that will shake his life forever  with the original trilogy finished in mad max beyond thunderdome mad max  beyond the thunder dome in 1985 it was 28 years before the filming of the new feature started which started in july 2012 in namibia and was released in 2015 there was an expectation coming from a director like george miller but as images and trailer were being released it became a work with great potential and this was realized with its release only the maximum potential of everything was raised what was expected  the experience of experiencing or rather saying witnessing this feature in a movie theater was certainly one of the best things of that year mad max fury road is one of the best films of 2015 and of the past decade the biggest and best action film in the history of cinema
Sep 20 2020,positive,i dont like action movies and i dont like chase scenes but somehow this movie managed to entertain me from start to finish
Sep 13 2020,positive,best action movie of all time packed with crazy sequences and spectacular photography highly recommended in the blackchrome version
Sep 6 2020,positive,with such a weird story this kovie is actually good
Sep 2 2020,positive,this was an amazing film the action in this film is outstanding tom hardy was much better in this movie than he was in venom definitely one of the best action films of the 2010s and one of my favorite films of all time
Sep 1 2020,positive,not everyones cup of tea but if you even remotely like things going boom brooding stoic characters or some off the chain insanity this is for you
Aug 29 2020,positive,doesnt get any better than this gutsy and glorious
Aug 17 2020,positive,i love this movie visually striking and the story is really good
Aug 7 2020,negative,only if youre in the mood for an endless car chase would you want to watch this film its a great car chase no doubt but its all noise and flash without substance
Aug 5 2020,negative,visually this was a fantastic piece a true nod to the original movies from a story standpoint it was blander than your grandmothers oatmeal effect alone do not make a good movie
Aug 1 2020,positive,this is very similar to bladerunner in my opinion the world is amazing and some of the characters are really good but the plot is a bit off i know this is unconventional and it took me a while to get used to it i really liked the start and most of the middle i feel like my eyes hadnt seen such amazing things before but the characters were a bit flat and the plot just seemed a little too simple get to the green place run from enemies definitely a movie you see at least once in a lifetime just accept that you may not understand some of it
Jul 25 2020,neutral,its alright but overrated tom hardy did good but i would of like to of seen mel gibson come back it was a bit of a slow paced film and was boring in some parts but it wasnt bad could of been better though
Jul 24 2020,positive,visually it looks great but there is allot wrong with it
Jul 23 2020,positive,visually stunning and a fun ride
Jul 20 2020,positive,the barren landscape beyond the end of the world is apparently the most robust playground to create deeply dynamic moving images mad max is a movie  a plethora of titillating fun all performances fall in line and unequivocally mount to form the beating heart of this monster after seeing it in cinemas at home and in airplanes i can tell you mad max is grand in all its forms it is a pure pleasure while its normal enough to break down films into their respective elements and judge them piece by piece one shouldnt do it here while star wars and other blockbusters attempt a 4d experience with a moving chair wind and water  here you have sight and sound colossal thats all if that kind of experience interests you strap in press play and blast off
Jul 18 2020,negative,if youre into moving stuff there is a whole lot of them here
Jul 17 2020,positive,incredible worldbuilding by george miller launches you into a beautifully apocalyptic wasteland then its a nonstop thrillride
Jul 15 2020,positive,perhaps one of the greatest action films of all time  if not one of the greatest films of all time the fourth installment in the mad max franchise finds new roads that are plentiful and delivers deliciously original ideas for a genre that has so many predictable sequels a must watch for any movie lover
Jul 15 2020,neutral,the issue with this movie is that the title character is very weakly written and probably miscast though the latter is hard to tell given the writing not all actors do borderline psychotic with rage issues well  when mad max is largely incidental to a mad max movie there is something definitely off with the franchise as this was marketed and sold as a franchise film that aspect cant really be ignored  the action and support cast was solid but it fails expectations
Jul 15 2020,negative,exhausting it was go go go from beginning to end about half way i was just wanting it to finish
Jul 10 2020,negative,ive tried a few times to get this movie started and cant make it past the first 10 minutes bleh
Jul 5 2020,positive,loved it saw it twice 2015 when it came out and today this was the second film i took my wife when we started dating she became a hardcore fan of tom hardy
Jul 3 2020,positive,sure it was a technical masterpiece but the story was as bare as bones
Jul 2 2020,positive,the performances of tom hardy and charlize theron paired with the story visuals and action sequences make this movie a masterpiece
Jun 28 2020,positive,brilliant film does the old mad max justice and engrossing from start to finish never lets up100 recommend
Jun 26 2020,negative,one of the very worst movies i have ever seen if i could give this movie a negative rating i would juvenile in the extreme relentlessly absurd and just plain unwatchable even though i received this movie for free with my 4k bluray player i still feel rippedoff its that bad while the hdr 4k video quality is impressive i cannot bring myself to watch it because the movie is so abysmal any film critic who has given this movie a positive review needs to find a new career
Jun 25 2020,positive,mad max fury road has some of the most exciting action scenes ive seen in any movie hardy and theron are the heart of the film which never lets it foot off the gas dont expect backstory long dialogue scenes heavy exposition or downtime this movie blasts into action from the first moments and keeps you there for two hours it is essentially a two hour chase scene with some of the greatest stunts and action ever filmed having recently gone through all 4 mad max movies i can say this is easily my favorite and i think the best of the franchise
Jun 24 2020,negative,this film is completely ridiculous i could not wait for it to finish i watched it with the rest of my family and when it eventually finished we were all in agreement we absolutely hated it  im not someone who often posts reviews but felt compelled in this instance as mad max fury road somehow gets very high online ratings and i just cannot understand why you have been warned
Jun 24 2020,positive,some movies are made purely for entertainment purposes and are full of jawdropping and cinematic moments mad max fury road 2015 is one of those movies which is low on substance but overcompensates in its story telling technique director george miller brings us a highoctane thrill ride where just like its main character max audience too is never at rest and is left wanting for more the director tries to bring forward a harsh world set in a dystopian future which is somewhat a mirror to our very own world or what it could become if everyone is reduced to a single instinct which is survival just as tom hardys max said in the opening of the film
Jun 23 2020,positive,good sequel with lots of action in this post apocalyptic world look i thought tom hardy did a good job as max along with charlize theron as furioso to make this work
Jun 22 2020,positive,this movie is amazing the action in this film is outstanding tom hardy was much better in this movie than he was in venom definitely one of the best action films of the 2010s
Jun 17 2020,positive,i cant describe how good this movie is
Jun 16 2020,positive,a highoctane whiteknuckle thrill ride spectacular stunts and cinematography make this a road trip quite unlike any other put to film
Jun 16 2020,positive,amazing movie in every way most movies that are brought back after a long time normally flop this was quite the opposite 
Jun 15 2020,positive,this is an awesome action movie with some of the best stunts and visual storytelling ive seen in the past decade
Jun 13 2020,positive,this is how action films should be made a blazing masterpiece
Jun 6 2020,positive,this is an action packed movie its also a visionary movie george miller might join the ranks of the greatest visionary directors with this one this being his king kong but because of some issues with the plot and some inconsistency with the action mad max fury road is nothing more than a fun action movie with some issues you have to overlook on purpose in order to enjoy it  spoiler alert   gasoline has always been at the heart of the battles in the wasteland in the mad max movies in this one the battle centers around some women and ultimately water but the truck that they are hauling is full of mothers milk and although it works as a concept in service to the theme it does little to build any tension whatsoever i dont think anyone really cares about the milk its justthere and so the only reason they are hauling that huge as truck is becausethey all fit in it speaking of which i still dont think i understand maxs motivation to help furiosa and the other pretty ladies out and so like the milk in the truck max is alsojust there   those problems aside the movie features some really awesome action lots of explosions and it all looks great there is a hue cast over everything by the sun that looks so nice some shots in this movie are jaw dropping even the subtler ones but there is a slight problem with the action that ultimately had me take away one star its not quite consistent at one point during an action sequence in which a lot is happening i noticed that one of the ladies stabbed a guy in the face with some spare bullets she grabbed off the dash of the truck have you ever in your life seen someone get stabbed with bullets its just not possible because bullets arent sharp enough nor long enough little moments like this ruin the gravity and validity of the action theres not many of these moments maybe just one but with the issues mentioned earlier it becomes hard to justify this film as something other than just a fun action movie with some issues
Jun 3 2020,negative,i had heard very good things about this movie so i decided to give it a shot it was honestly one of the worst movies i have ever watched you get no storyline and the development of the plot is awful it was all just action explosions and ridiculous looking people it had the littlest dialogue i have ever seen a movie have on top of this its 2 hours i was expecting it to be this long because i though somewhere they would develop the story but nope not at all please do not watch this movie total waste of time
Jun 3 2020,positive,you know hope is a mistake if you cant fix whats broken youll go insane    ive waited a while to write this one down not because i saw it another two times no thats not the way it was i needed time to absorb what i saw and loved mad max fury road is oldschoolchaseactionmovie no doubt about it the most creative movie ive watched in years    the car builds are amazingly crude and complex each one with names and personality of its own real crashes with real cars and man what awesome stunt work this movie have fully functioning cars mechanics and bikes music leaded by the excellent blind guitarbass player and the fellows of the percussion that begins only when they are close great acting from every one of the cast lead and support charismatic and believable characters tom hardy and charlize theron are two equals in every way power strength appearance will reason one the lone survivor and the other a savior    come on writing this down makes me want to see it again witness the madness that the postapocalyptic has become see the war boys praising the lord v8 the aquacola waterfall and the survival of men oh what a day what a lovely day what a lovely movie
May 29 2020,positive,perfect in every way 
May 26 2020,positive,straight up one of the best action movies of alltime insane action and great characters
May 26 2020,positive,kickass action flick that requires a strong ability to suspend disbelief from its audience which is what ultimately hurt this spectacle for me that and the hardcore subliminal messaging advocating for the feminine imperative in regards to political leadership strange that it came out when hillary was running for prez
May 15 2020,positive,exciting action sequences impressive practical effects and real stunts a surprisingly great use of political environmental and feminist themes interesting and compelling characters excellent performances a fast pace and an engaging and emotionally satisfying narrative it brings new life to george millers iconic franchise with great effect

Apr 16 2020,neutral,full of action great cast and good cgi but i didnt understand the movie maybe if i watched the other ones i would but i was completely lost this movie was super weird and a lot of stupid moments i feel this is extremely overrated and i dont understand the really good reviews this was laughably bad but there was some good moments
Apr 15 2020,positive,the title should say enough on what its about although i have to mention how good tom hardy was
Apr 14 2020,negative,i created this account to leave a review because i was so disappointed from this movie my boyfriend and i love action movies and we did not even finish it there was no variety it was the same setting and same chase the whole movie i have a really hard time understanding why this movie is so well rated
Apr 14 2020,positive,this film is pretty awesome its a great rush most of it is practical effects and some things are kept vague giving them mystery
Apr 12 2020,positive,exhilarating action  cinema top class production values mesmerising from first screen shot to the last  a george miller masterpiece visually captivating and grips you from start to finish  average plot line but charlize theron gives a great screen stealing performance  whenever you think of this movie afterwards its the visuals that you remember most
Apr 11 2020,negative,i dont know what everyone is thinking the original series had an gritty apocalyptic realism to it one that you could at least imagine a pathway from our current world to the world depicted in it this movie is like an absurdist spoof of the original series a superhero fantasy filled with impossible stunts ridiculous plot line and laughably onedimensional characters that some critics were able to find depth in this is a real head scratcher utterly predictable the only redeeming feature was the overthetop creativity of the mutant vehicles which only added to the absurdity
Apr 10 2020,positive,an action masterpiece easily one of the greatest action movies ever made you have to live the experience to understand what the hype is about because its stupid to talk about this movie without watching it before we can see a fiction world which its locations characters and costumes were perfectly created theres not a moment where youre not surprised by what you are watching or hearing because the sound editing is amazing what a day what a lovely day
Apr 7 2020,positive,speed fury vengeance blood these are the elements that unite the fury road and the brilliant mix of them creates one of the most coherent action films of all time

Apr 3 2020,positive,pure perfection no other explanation
Mar 29 2020,negative,youre all truly wrong this movie is an abomination related to the rest of the series absurd editing only suitable for adderal addicted video game addicts the terrible pacing just kept speeding and speeding until the view had absolutely no idea or empathy for any of the characters all of the gritty postapocalyptic realism of the other films were destroyed in one scene  some jackass playing eclectic guitar on the front of a dumbass monster mobile  this movie is so bad i have to belive all the positive reviews are total sarcasm theres no was that many people liked this movie well i guess if they never saw the other films in the franchise and they just like terrible postapocalyptic cgi porn   worst rotten tomato reviewpercentage ever makes me think rt might actually suck
Mar 29 2020,positive,perfect   i just rewatched this again and im still as in awe as i was the first time i saw it   too much eye candy to see in a single viewing every time you blink you missed an amazing several frames every shot is beautiful every scene is as stunning as it is immersive   this is film making with passion and an appreciation and love for the true art absolutely incredible  i just want to say thank you to everyone involved in this amazing film   thank you
Mar 26 2020,positive,an incredible masterpiece and one of the best movies of the 2010s decade
Mar 20 2020,positive,incredible practical effects and the development of distinctive entertaining characters and settings contribute to one of the greatest action films of the decade successfully conveying the road warriors combination of objective ridiculousness in its character design while still maintaining sincerity and drawing the two together with sutures of pulsepounding adrenaline fury road never lets the audience fall into a dull moment 455
Mar 20 2020,negative,literal garbage should have walked out
Mar 19 2020,negative,lacking until the end poor dialogue just full action at the end so you forgot about the poor dialogue and story and no stakes
Mar 14 2020,positive,constant intense action throughout with good acting a simple but reasonable plot and nice cinematography my biggest complaint would be that in editing a lot of the shots were sped up which was very noticeable looked strange and completely unnecessary
Mar 12 2020,positive,george miller flares up with a fantastic film that never bores its always nailbiting and fun fantastic performances excellent practical effects and makes you wonder more about this beautiful wasteland and its characters and makes you want more and makes you want more
Mar 10 2020,negative,took the most exciting part of road warrior1981 and made a whole movie around the chase  very eccentric  unique  non stop actionstunts one right after another  all that going for it and i really didnt like this bad movie
Mar 9 2020,negative,rubbish film lacks story and any continuity with mm2 cant get over people saying this is good it was dire

Feb 27 2020,positive,upon rewatch even though the story is worse than i remember and i could rip it apart for days ive discovered that that matters less to me sure it would have been amazing for fury roads plot match its visual but im mostly okay that it doesnt
Feb 17 2020,negative,total waste of time
Feb 12 2020,positive,mad max fury road tells an important and relevant story to one of the biggest long run challenges the world has to face extreme scarcity of resources in this fictional world humanity is enslaved under a tyrant warlord named joe and his gang of war boys joe keeps all of the worlds water for himself and exploits his slaves for breastmilk and children from some of the women as well as draining blood from universal donors like max max meets up with the female driver and warrior furiosa as she attempted to flee from the oppressive society to the greenplace safehaven with all of the women joe enslaved as his childbearing wives unfortunately and quite expectedly the greenplace no longer existed as furiosa remembered as it was now a swamp so of course this means max and furiosa will face immortan joe head on to end his tyranny and joes death is at the hands of furiosa in the end    delving into a deeper analysis of the film we see there is a lot going on here besides impressive cgi and the anticipated explosions of a generic action movie the story is interesting because it deals with the issue of scarce resources after a nuclear world disaster which is a reasonable fear considering the cold war and rise of nuclear arsenals in powerful nations due to the depletion of resources and most importantly water joe was able to hold power by constructing a power dynamic where he possess all of the water and therefore everyone must obey him in order to live we see him waste water through an extravagant waterfall which the common people are supposed to collect in a bucket as it falls as joe seems to remain apathetic towards the finite resources this is the reason we want furiosa and max to succeed so badly while their escape to the greenplace might have been an surface level satisfactory ending to the film it doesnt really solve the problem we need furiosa to succeed for some inner peace and a sense of true resolution she is the only woman warrior in the society as the rest are under the slavery and oppression of immortan joe which gives us another reason to cheer for her furiosa being the individual to kill immortan joe highlights this dynamic as we see one of the women of this society that treats females as physical things rise up and literally put an end to her authoritarian oppressor a large feminist theme stood out to me throughout this movie however despite being an action movie mad max fury road is rich with several themes and a conversation sparking social commentary about the moral rights and worth of humans as well as women
Feb 12 2020,positive,fast and furiosa a review of mad max fury road    mad max fury road is a film that starts out fast and never slows down the film is set in a postapocalyptic wasteland of the world mad max is captured by war boys owned by immortan joe the antagonist of the film the film follows the journey of the two protagonists max and a woman named furiosa on their quest to free the five wives from immortan joes control much of the film occurs on the fury road a passageway through the wasteland of the earth this film is fast hot and chaotic     this film was brought to us by warner brothers in 2015 and is directed by george miller and is an example of the young woman from the provinces archetype furiosa escapes the grips of immortan joe with his five wives in search of the green place a place full of hope and prosperity amongst a wasteland furiosa wants to free the women from a life of sex enslavement mad max also escapes his captors and aids the women on their dangerous quest for freedom    one tool george miller uses effectively in this film is cinematography the camera angles and shots of the highspeed chase are awardworthy one scene in particular depicts furiosa coming to terms with the fact that the green place has turned into a wasteland her anguish and defeat are captured perfectly in this scene as she falls to her knees and the wind stirs up the sand around her and lens flare is used this film also uses rockandroll music predominantly as the soundtrack this choice effectively conveys the chaos and speed of this film     imagery is another tool used effectively in this film immortan joe is depicted as disgusting ugly and rotting this matches his greed misogyny and cruelty whereas the wives are depicted as beautiful and embody purity however graphic imagery and violence is overused at times and seems to detract from the overall message of the film the stunts and explosions are still impressive nevertheless     george miller is able to convey a message about gender roles in society and socioeconomic divisions in the backdrop of a highspeed action film immortan joes greedy control of the earths limited water supply shows how the wealthy control the majority of resources in our society additionally the women in this film are treated as property women are depicted as useful only for their reproductive abilities and men are depicted as vehicles of war or misogynist dictators the ultimate defeat of immortan joe symbolizes the downfall of misogyny and sexism in society    although this film is certainly entertaining the storyline and plot are a bit confusing and chaotic the film has little to no exposition and begins as bizarre and obscure right of the bat viewers are left to play catch up to figure out what is going on as the film progresses however unlike many other scifi and fantasy films george miller successfully conveys a social commentary amongst the backdrop of a high speed thriller i give this film 4 out of 5 stars
Feb 12 2020,negative,over produced and full of hollywood rubbish the car chase was completely unrealistic in that somehow they made up a days head start in no time at all and the beginning of the cause with the guitar playing etc was pathetic i nearly turned it off at that point but it was only 830pm and i had nothing better to do mad max  mad 2 are streets ahead of the rest
Feb 12 2020,neutral,mad max  fury road  the young woman from the providence the protagonist antagonist relationship is obvious in this movie but what is not clear from a person with no introduction or understanding of mad max is the situation in which the people find themselves in furiosa being the young woman from the providence finds herself starring as the guiding light for others to follow uniquely we find that the power relationship between men and women is not as straightforward as it might seem as the side of the antagonist is guided by men but dependent upon women the protagonists side is made of women but characterized by mad max and furiosas journey   the feminist perspective the movie highlights the strong male dominance that this world portrays they call water aquacola but depend on milk for strength and maintaining health they call this mothers milk furiosa can be slanted as the mother of five as she rebels from her duties of driving a warrig to guide these young women to a green place likely referring to green pastures or a better place   another scene that highlights the importance of females in this movie is the scene of the sniper rifle when one bullet remains in the rifle max hands it over to furiosa as she only needs one shot to take out the followers   however power dynamics exist strongly in mad max two scenes highlight this directly women are chained up to be milked like cows for the service of the men who fight and the entire movie based on my perception of the movie is about the antagonist tribe trying to recollect the wives to preserve their survival resources seem to be the only thing that matters in this movie as it is set in a postapocalyptic world  overall the film is unclear to someone new to the mad max universe who is the young girl that max keeps having flashbacks of many questions not answered
Feb 10 2020,positive,visually stunning lots of fun and lots of suspense the world is hopeless and sinister an it works well as entertainment action packed through the whole movie if you are looking for character development or a well written drama this is not the movie for you this is explosions and popcorn time it works but it would be so much better with some more drama and character arcs
Feb 6 2020,positive,a placeholder in my top ten for sure
Feb 5 2020,positive,its worth the watch effects are almost perfect i watched it with my 16 year old and they didnt know what and why everything was happening they should have given more of the back story for those who dont know the history of mad max
Jan 30 2020,positive,a masterpiece for anyone who appreciates furious action art movies it felt like a pulsing ecstasy due to superb editing and score the storyline is primitive which is good in this case riding to valhalla
Jan 30 2020,positive,just incredible visual storytelling that brings forth the power of cinema once again the character of mad max is used to lead the viewer into the bleak world of george miller furiosa forever
Jan 29 2020,negative,i genuinely think that this is the worst movie ive ever seen no actual or at least interesting plot boring unnecessarily long scenes of fricking stupid fighting or chasing scenes ridiculous acting and facial reactions nothing smart or new or creative or artistic or deep or nailbiting about this bs that won undeserved awards it was really a waste of time a bummer that it is so praised for i dont understand what fcking reason that it has such a high score on both imdb and rotten tomatoes more than classic good movies how come this movie has a higher score than twelve angry men paris texas la strada or call me by your name there must be something very wrong with our society if this emotionless boring bad acted movie is so loved while actual masterpieces are ignored educate yourself before you give a ten to a piece of bs like this please thank you
Jan 25 2020,positive,quite good tom hardys almost mute performance is hypnotic
Jan 25 2020,positive,incredible movie amazing visuals i wish more movies started life like this one did as a screenplaycomic rather than a script it lead to amazing results here
Jan 23 2020,positive,although i really hope humanity doesnt live in an apocalyptic wasteland in the future that hope cant stop me from loving this movie mad max fury road is just amazing the exciting action scenes alone are enough to impress the viewers lets not forget the movies interesting dystopian story and the great actingtom hardy and charlize theron are splendid too i also love the way mad max is narrated and it even gets a bit emotional in the end so yeah it really is a great movie
Jan 21 2020,positive,this is what entertainment should be
Jan 20 2020,positive,legendary and untouchable movie
Jan 18 2020,positive,fantastic one of the best action movies ever
Jan 11 2020,positive,a great action movie with amazing scenes and visuals a new cult classic that you must not loose if you are a fun of over the top car chases and steampunk dystopian futures
Jan 9 2020,positive,mad max fury road may be the fourth film in the series the first in 30 years yet its brilliant direction and gorgeous cinematography  combined with its surprising thematic elegance  make it easily the best installment in the franchise  simply put this is one of the greatest action movies ever made
Jan 8 2020,positive,this movie is no doubt is going to be classic in the future truly an action masterpiece with terrific performances i love almost everything is practical and because of that every punch kick and shot felt so good not to forget how great the soundtrack and the line in this movie is also very quotable as if you love action movie this is just how great and thrilling it can be done so yeah absolutely an awesome movie probably one of the best aspects from this movie is the cinematography perfectly capture the roughness of barren postapocalyptic wasteland while still make it looks mesmerizing at the same time
Jan 6 2020,positive,so much action there was barely time for dialogue  the coordination of the special effects and stunt people was amazing  couldnt give this film a higher rating due to how long it was  no character development
Jan 6 2020,positive,loved it the energy and ferocity of this movie feels like theres fire in my veins stunning visual and epic score  whats not to like a personal favorite movie of mine
Jan 5 2020,negative,my least favorite parts of action movies are chase scenes guess what the whole movie is only a chance scene not for me giant thumbs down booooooooring
Jan 3 2020,neutral,it was okay im not sure why everyone lost their mind about it not groundbreaking like mad max 2 or 3 just a higher budget rehash good but my socks are still firmly on
Jan 3 2020,negative,several things about this movie called my attention bothered me andor seemed absurd to me    1 itss called mad max fury road despite the plot revolving around furiosa and her kidnapping of immortal joes wives max is barely something above a prop    2 that burning man mobile lots of drums huge front facing speakers and a flame throwing guitar playing some sort of mishmash between punk heavy and thrash that actually sounded pretty cool and according to the internet its purpose was to raise morale and pump up the soldiers    but heres the thing the producers are most likely used to the humming purr of nice new cars i bet they never in their sheltered lives have hopped on a car built from poorly soldered parts of several cars well i have and i can tell you even without dangling chains squeaky spikes plastered all over the exterior and modifications that put the motor right behind your ears its impossible to have a normal conversation in a junk rescued car theres no way those soldiers could hear their mobile metal fest    in practice that truck only served the purpose of giving away their location    3 biker grannies i wouldve bought one biker grannie in a big gang because theres always one trigger happy octogenarian who enjoys riding motorbikes right    but so many biker grannies with enough upper body strength to control a big bike with one hand while aiming shooting and withstanding recoil with the other all of that midjump without any impairment usually found among that age group like high blood pressure back pains arthritis or shaky hands    watching all those old women jumping around the dunes like a team of red bull x fighters was more than what my suspension of disbelief could handle    4 why is joe the bad guy    seriously after a post apocalyptic scenario he was able to build a shelter big enough to securely house an entire town he found drinking water and designed a system to preserve it built an army to defend his settlement and organized his people to create all sorts of low tech monuments to ingenuity like his human powered elevator    despite all the poor living conditions they had their people had it better than other settlements and definitely way better than the alternative of dying alone in the radioactive wasteland    joe had commercial arrangements with neighboring settlements and with that he set society back in motion    and how they repay him    furiosa betrays him and kidnaps the rest of his wives one of them insisted on going back but her captors insisting in the were rescuing you narrative denied her freedom    joe was a man who spared no resources on rescuing his family and he was even denied a decent time to mourn his wife and child who died falling from their captors vehicle    furiosa returned to take away the small oasis this man built in the middle of the barren desert after her absurd fairy tale turned out to be a lie    the worst part his own people cheering for the traitor after a populist move of irresponsibly opening the floodgates to waste unholy amounts of water    this movie angered me so much
Jan 3 2020,positive,best action movie of the decade
Jan 2 2020,positive,a balanced good movie
Jan 2 2020,positive,my favorite action film in a long time  this movie was so outrageously good the casting pacing acting storylines and action  good lord
Jan 1 2020,positive,wow that first scene was one of the best chase scenes ive ever seen also it was the worst one in the movie my thoughts after watching this fury road starts at 11 and then ups it up and more what a ride
Dec 31 2019,negative,only redeeming thing was charlize theron kicking ass  the rest of it was just loud and gross if you want to see tom hardy in a mask for a whole movie watch dark knight rises
Dec 30 2019,positive,im really having a hard time seeing why people loved this movie and are calling it one of the best movies of the decade it didnt appeal to me i like action films and the movie does give plenty of bad ass action sequences as well as given us insane looking car designs which references the older movies tom hardy and charlize theron also give very good performances but unfortunately i found the plot quite dull and the characters are thinly written near the end i was just waiting for the film to end overall im probably not going to revisit this film and ill just stick with mad max from 1979
Dec 30 2019,positive,probably the best action movie of the decade in a decade with action movies like john wick and mission impossible that says a lot
Dec 30 2019,negative,walked outwhich i rarely doawful and monotonous

Dec 2 2019,positive,few films that wait well over a decade have a successful sequel this one doesnt either it supersedes any other of the franchise while some complain that hardy and theron are typecasted they work so much better than any other possible duo easily a top 10 film of the 2010s
Dec 2 2019,neutral,is anybody else bored with this womens thing yet its mad max not foaming furiosa lets remind ourselves how the remake of ghostbusters went
Nov 29 2019,positive,iconic action films seemed to fade away after the 90s sure there is alot of action films more than ever these days but truly iconic action films are so rare these days  this is one of those rarities the best of the history of the action genre successfully packed into one adrenaline pumping nonstop drive that is just as iconic as the first and second in its series were back when they hit the cinemas
Nov 29 2019,positive,its good in my opinion not the best in the series but still really fun actionsicfi
Nov 27 2019,positive,its rare to see an action film that never loses its way the good shepherd had the right action plot but it only had 15 minutes of actual violence minority report had the right plot and was action packed for the first 25 minutes but really slowed down and in the end fell flat
Nov 26 2019,positive,really not the target audience for this movie rather indifferent to pureaction movies allergic to superheroes not a fan of violence  and guess what i went along for the ride  i found the aesthetic and pace pretty irresistible and even bought the damselsindistress cliché because it fitted the style so well some eery nostalgic moments also left me a lasting impression
Nov 23 2019,neutral,only special effects nothing interesting
Nov 20 2019,negative,nice visuals etc  very weak scenario
Nov 18 2019,negative,it gets somewhat interesting in the middle of the movie but the first quarter is mindless action sequences that provide no background to get you engaged also why is mad max playing second fiddle to a female lead nothing against female leads but the name of the movie is friggin mad max
Nov 16 2019,negative,not much of a story tom hardy terrible actor as usual
Nov 12 2019,positive,although it only focuses on one car chase during a huge part of the movie miller surprised me and got me begging for a sequel starring hardys max

Oct 25 2019,positive,greatest action movie ever made
Oct 25 2019,positive,mad max fury road is a film that i truly enjoyed watching the entire film was well constructed from top to bottom while touching on the pressing topic of our world as we know it turning into a desert where water is a high commodity the film has a lot of heart without verbally saying much the acting from theron hardy and hoult was deep this film is very visual from the cinematography color grading production design special effects and costuming the film creates this amazing world filled with gold red and bright turquoise it is an interesting combination of skull laden violence from the vehicles and warriors paired with the vast ethereal landscapes and whiteclothed females the combination works as these elements often go hand in hand i enjoyed the cinematography in the film because it was very dynamic and the edit worked great with the shots and furthering the story although there was minimal dialogue in the film the soundscape and accompanying score took me into the world of the film i enjoyed seeing the rock elements incorporated throughout the film 
Oct 19 2019,positive,blown away by this film as if watching a movie from the future
Oct 18 2019,negative,an insult to the original mad max still not sure what the point of the movie was its tolerable if you like tom hardy

Sep 11 2019,positive,2 hours of none stop amazing chase scenes makes you want to learn more about its history
Sep 11 2019,positive,what is release date mad max wasteland 
Sep 10 2019,positive,any fan of the originals will love this
Sep 9 2019,negative,extremely overrated
Sep 7 2019,positive,fans of the mad max series will not be disappointed epically confusing first 45 minutes are more or less redeemed by the final hour very good cast
Sep 5 2019,positive,this movie is great is like a punch of violence and pure action george miller did a great job doing this movie because he knows his shit   tom hardys actuation is very solid but not better than mel gibson anyway he still be the max we all love charlize is one of the best thing among the movie she looks so badass and her acting is great   the first part of the movie is the best even the first ten minutes are breathtaken you cant take your eyes off the screen even if you try but the second part i have to admited it its not as good as the first  the photographi is also great in one scene you can feel the power of the desert and the makeup is also very good not for nothin this movie won an oscar for that
Sep 3 2019,positive,incredible action well shot no real plot or dialogue to speak of though max himself mostly just grunts inaudibly the whole movie
Sep 3 2019,positive,the movie is the action but im not saying that there is nothing else in the movie than action what i mean is that the progress of the story and the characters developments are delivered by the action itself and its great to see how it works perfectly
Sep 2 2019,positive,one of my most favorite movies
Sep 1 2019,positive,this movie and tdk are two of my favourite movies ever direction is so realistic that i felt suffocated tom hardy and charlize theron chemistry on the screen was wonderful
Aug 29 2019,positive,fantastic action movie looks really cool in black  chrome
Aug 29 2019,positive,this movie was a delightful surprise you expect simple action adventure and you end up with love nonromantic loyalty revenge ferocity justice and hope  all with minimal dialog fantastically fun theatrics and a style thats just metal af   its got just enough camp to make it endearing but not so much that you lose the surprising weight of the film   its visceral without being gorey and the relationships that form seem almost effortless   stands out as something special to me because of the abundance of powerful thoughtful brave skilled women age 2282 and while love forms with the small number of important male characters its not some cheap romance but its something so much cooler   one of my favorite films 
Aug 25 2019,positive,this is downright the best action movie ive ever seen and i dont think any movie could easily beat it not now not almost ever
Aug 24 2019,positive,this film isnt badbut i think mad max is slightly overratedin my opinionfamous actors in this filmlike tom hardy or charlize theron were really ordinary and not  interesting7 out of 10
Aug 22 2019,negative,stupidest movie of the century
Aug 20 2019,positive,full on adrenaline rush 
Aug 19 2019,positive,mad max fury road is the terminator 2 of the 2010s decade not only one of the best rebooted franchise movies in years but an overall cinematic paradise the aberrant wasteland that is the desert apocalypse instills the kind of imagination we yearned for growing up driven forward by the mighty chase sequences and bold character choices this movie will leave you thirsting for more max
Aug 17 2019,positive,good movie fast paced and strong motivations
Aug 15 2019,positive,one of the greatest action films of all time
Aug 9 2019,negative,the whole movie is basically just one really long car chase
Aug 3 2019,positive,having never seen the previous installments in the mad max series i walked into this film with no frame of reference for why all of the characters speak idiotically or why the action is so jerky i quickly realized that fans of the franchise must just enjoy the sight of supermodels in skimpy clothing wandering around in the desert and vehicles blowing up sights that arent aligned with my own personal tastes in cinema i appreciate the fact that the film commits to its mindlessness and is essentially just one long extended car chase and the technical elements of the film were impressive but it was hard to invest in anything when all of the characters were so flat    max rockatansky tom hardy is a lone wolf traveling through a post apocalyptic world where he has been traumatized by a past event by a young girl he is captured by the members of an immoral cult who bow down to the evil immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne who forces women to have his children against his will he is able to escape from his bindings and teams up with furiosa charlize theron who had been hired to transport some of the pregnant women but who is helping them escape to the green place they are chased by the villainous cult members throughout and several of the women die but they also make friends with cult member nux nicholas hoult who aids them in their mission     the most amazing sequences in the film come when the dizzying action stops and we are allowed to simply marvel at the barren landscape while the film was shot in namibia not australia the film has a distinctly aussie feel and if you have ever been in the outback it is hard not to have fond memories of your time there while watching this film the sand storm is visual stunning as much as it goes on for too long and would have been more interesting if surrounded by a story willing to make us invest in characters and conflicts miller is clearly very interested in showing how an environment this harsh would push people to be extremely resourceful and ruthless in order to survive but he doesnt provide us with anything beyond these visually intense but unemotional shots to provoke these thoughts and feelings in us    the action sequences in the film are entertaining enough as we see lots of violence and gore the stunt work is all excellent and the imagery very on brand even with my limited knowledge of the franchise this would all be fantastic if the film was only ninety minutes long and the sequences were less repetitive but at two hours you begin to feel numbed to the sight of cars blowing up and pregnant women dying i wasnt expecting the film to be as restrained as the wages of fear 1953 or yojimbo 1961 but i would have appreciated some analysis of the characters actions or some deeper exploration of how violence impacts people    the performances received a lot of praise but i dont see anything special in them as while i think theron is one of the greatest actresses of her generation i dont think she gets an opportunity to do much with this role hardy is inscrutable in the lead role but i suppose he is a decent strong silent type even though he is hardly henry fonda in jesse james 1939 as for the supermodels in the background they bring their considerable beauty to their roles but deliver some of the worst lines in the screenplay with a complete lack of conviction that belies how difficult it is to bring life to roles that require them to be sex objects on the whole i would argue that this element of the film has been overpraised and i hope that theron brings more to atomic blonde 2017 than she does to this or i doubt her abilities as an action star    i would call this film decent but never brilliant and it is hyperbolic to call it one of the best films of the 21st century when margaret 2011 and you can count on me 2000 exist
Aug 3 2019,positive,its such a great film that shows modern cinema that you can make a great movie with great world building and amazing action in this day and age of bad cgi and corny superhero movies
Aug 3 2019,negative,plot holes and inconsistency galore cliche and over the top world building that breaks immersion poor done characters and too many deus ex machina that amount to granting the main character super powers
Jul 31 2019,positive,pure action and madness with many great characters what could be better than that
Jul 31 2019,positive,while the films absurdity can become as overwhelming as the desert landscape the eccentric plot and performances serve to create thrilling action sequences and a lot of fun overall
Jul 28 2019,positive,one of the best movies ever saw seen it like 20 times
Jul 27 2019,negative,as dull as shit an utterly pointless endeavour a crappy road trip that i take on a weekly basiswith a bit less drama but just as disappointing
Jul 25 2019,positive,fury road is full of the most intense and cinematically satisfying chase sequences youll ever see not to mention the welldone score
Jul 21 2019,positive,it is a fantastic action film filled with spectacular visuals sounds and score the movie is missing an impactful story to be an instant masterpiece 
Jul 20 2019,positive,great action and special effects the acting was also very on spot but the plot was very weak almost no plot at all 
Jul 19 2019,positive,the best of them all
Jul 17 2019,positive,visually stunning the flashbacks were kinda pointless not a lot of meat to the story besides lots of driving 
Jul 15 2019,positive,im confused by this movie i mean i dont understand why it doesnt just have a 100 percent perfect score on the tomato meter both the critic score and the audience score for mad max fury road should automatically be at 100 yet here we are looking at this confusing score get ready for almost literally nonstop action from beginning to end literally every single thing was done perfectly oh and they even use practical effects aka perfect movie oh and they have awesome worldbuilding with no info dumps like i said this is cinematic perfection
Jul 13 2019,positive,phenomenal action scenes the vehicles are a marvel to look at you root for the heroes and the villains are memorable
Jul 11 2019,negative,tom hardy may be the title character but he is barely a supporting cast member in this film fury road is just one very long truck chase 
Jul 2 2019,positive,an awesome film that shows that mad max is back
Jun 29 2019,positive,fantastic  action packed entertainment 
Jun 28 2019,negative,not sure whos calling this one of the greatest action films ever bored throughout and almost turned it off several times original so much better
Jun 28 2019,positive,i loved it this movie is insanely entertaining sadly its writing isnt top notch the world is kind of silly its an apocalyptic wasteland where resources are scarce but there are plenty of functioning cars and dirtbikes another thing is that our protagonist max teams up with women that were breeders who escaped from this bad guy called immortan joe the problem with this is that these women were clearly cared for they got the best food shelter and water in this apocalyptic wasteland while everyone else is dying in the dirt from dehydration and god knows what else these women had some of the most privilege in immortan joes society and they just ran away if this was real life women would be throwing themselves in swarms at joe and his crew for the benefits of being a breeder because its better than living in the dirt dying of dehydration in fact how were they even able to plan the escape if they were locked in a vault how did they sneak aboard the truck this definitely takes the movie down 2 stars and when you see the ending you may even question who the good guys are
Jun 24 2019,negative,it goes nowhere they just drive around awful movie 
Jun 22 2019,positive,its an action movie revolution that thrills you until the end and is also thoughtprovoking throughout the fresh colors and production design fury road is delivering let other movies look bland 
Jun 16 2019,positive,thanks for the session
Jun 15 2019,positive,this movie is so good go watch now
Jun 15 2019,positive,insane i cant believe i waited 4 years to watch this   im so ashamed one of the best action movies ever
Jun 9 2019,positive,visually stunning loved the casting
Jun 4 2019,positive,one damn big chase sequence and holy hell its amazing
Jun 3 2019,positive,exciting fun and with the best action sequences
Jun 2 2019,positive,ive never seen a story unfold this way in fact ive never seen a movie unfold its action characters universe in quite a brilliant package thanks george
May 28 2019,positive,hands down one of my absolute favourite movies the cinematography is masterful the soundtrack a perfect bombastic fit the action sequences are certainly a highlight but youll also find interesting characters and an impactful narrative
May 25 2019,positive,there is no way to make this film better one of the best from 2015 and one of the greatest action movies of all time on top of that hardy and theron are absolutely badass and their chase through the desert wasteland created some of the best action ever on film amazing stunt work and actors do great with relatively little dialogue this movie will never get old
May 25 2019,positive,while not exceptionally smart or insightful mad max fury road excels in what it wanted to accomplish being stupid being loud being colorful and artsy but most of all being a great time
May 25 2019,positive,absolutely brilliant the stunts the effects the cast and the story were top notch
May 13 2019,negative,extremly bad movie its a pure waste of time
May 12 2019,negative,when i googled manly films this did not show up but it was the first result for feminist films shows how cucked the guys are in this film were yeet
May 11 2019,positive,what a dayy what a lovelyy dayy
May 8 2019,positive,starts with an action scene which two hours later is over a picture of a movie
May 5 2019,positive,ill be honest i love this movie i love everything about it the action in this film is an absolute spectacle to behold and while the characters might be simple they are effective enough to carry the plot there is this whole thing with the female characters and messages of oppression from men but even that somehow manages not to come off as too preachy or overly annoying on the whole mad max fury road has to be one of my favorites
May 5 2019,negative,the true dystopia of the future is lost in this unlikeable reimagining mad max was wonderful truly just a low budget dream this however us a high budget nightmare
May 5 2019,negative,was this a good movie  yes was it top 10 no
May 5 2019,positive,to paraphrase queenwho shares something of the films kitsch epic glam metal aestheticthis is a sheer art attack often empty of words yet filled to edges with visual imagination millers longgestating fourth installment is pure cinematic spectacle a masterclass in the language of filmmaking little would be lost were this without even a shred of dialogue the setting itself may be austere and sadistic hearkening back to the desert chases of the silent era while divining the look of an apocalypsetocome but the screen is plastered with color and creativity crafted with confident passion that stops the movie from ever becoming bleak or boring
May 4 2019,positive,if the dark knight and inception didnt exist mad max fury road would be the greatest action film ever made ive never seen a film that made my blood pump with excitement before this one    the fact that most of the stunts were real makes my jaw drop and the genius color palette is just beautiful to look at oh what a movie what a lovely movie
May 4 2019,negative,worst action movie ever
May 2 2019,positive,great action sequences rip war rig 
May 2 2019,positive,best action film since terminator 2 with crazy action sequences and a plot that never stops
Apr 20 2019,positive,a great action film  not a lot of dialog but still a lot of great acting  not a lot of dialog but still a lot of plot
Apr 7 2019,positive,simplicity at its core is probably the best receipe for a well rythmed intense action feature probably the best of its kind
Apr 6 2019,positive,wonderful popcornaktion
Apr 4 2019,negative,have always been a big fan of mad max but this was just terrible while the continuity between the mad max movies has always been very thin but fury road seems to have thrown it all out the window    the world is pure fantasy with ridiculous technology the character of max was divided up between 3 different roles making max nearly unnecessary   perhaps if they had just made a post apocalyptic movie without tying it to mad max i would have enjoyed it more
Apr 2 2019,positive,even though ive watched a number of times on cellphones its still not boring for me tom hardy is my idol actor
Apr 2 2019,positive,no words no words can describe how great this movie is never mind i can describe this movie its one of the best movies in movie history and easily the best reboot of all time the movie flows in a way thats intriguing and interesting the action is fastpaced and awesome it also seems sort of realistic because it seems like it could be what our world looks like if an apocalypse happened the ending is great with a great payoff and the villain immorton joe is very very menacing this is a mustwatch please watch it
Mar 31 2019,positive,one of the few movies i was willing to pay more than once to see in the theatre very little i can say about this one that is negative where so many other recent movies have failed to develop a believable and unforced badass female character this one succeeds
Mar 29 2019,positive,best movie ever i stand by this
Mar 13 2019,positive,amazing action nonstop best  mad mad film
Mar 9 2019,positive,love the post apocalyptic setting the cars the characters
Mar 8 2019,positive,a perfect action film everything about this movie is incredible and the cinematography is phenomenal without a doubt the best film of 2015
Mar 8 2019,negative,the women are kinda playing rolls that are unbelieveable great props and special effects george miller is an talented film maker
Mar 6 2019,positive,go long and fast    mad max fury road    miller has taken things too far even for this franchise are we supposed to chug it all up as much as passionate and meticulously driven this post apocalyptic world is i would like to think that the genre scifi which so it blatantly claims to be is either misinterpreted or taken for granted in here this film is far from being thought provoking this raw ruffian ideology that george miller the writerdirector thrives upon is more admirable than overwhelming his utter fierceful confident in his vision is frankly dangerous to pull off such a heist if i could call it at this scale is purely inspirational    it is so bizarrely grand that the narration or characters or even the cinema itself gets lost into the dust aforementioned it can be difficult for some viewers to swallow in this whole tale swirling around in a pathos unapologetic world there is barely any host for us to root for and this very three dimensional take is what helps the cast to portray a fluid creamy persona in this bumpy road charlize theron as the most lethal and convincing among all is more than a match for tom hardys one instinctish iconic character max    in fact if anything hardy has to try hard even snatch a gun in order to helm charge on her a fatal attempt as theron refuses to share the steely cold looks with anyone on screen another fascinating factor is the supporting characters and how invested they are in telling this story crossing boundaries and showcasing a feat of bravery and commitment this ensemble of cast defines the term teamwork to a whole new level mad max fury road iterates the theme of the world in its long action sequences a game of chess not the sacrifice or the head scratching tricks of it but a succession of winning attempts
Mar 5 2019,negative,i give the part i saw one star but i walked out on the rest of it so im giving a little extra to account for what i didnt see what kind of movie has a 45minute climax at the beginning of the film the costumes and makeup were well executed but so overthetop it looked like they were trying way too hard
Mar 4 2019,positive,classic mad max i really enjoyed the story tom hardy as max and the overall feel of the movie
Mar 3 2019,positive,great movie wild special effects
Mar 3 2019,positive,highoctane and gorgeous to look at mad max fury road raised the bar for action films since its release with very few even coming close
Mar 3 2019,positive,the best car chase of all time
Mar 2 2019,positive,hell yeah after being stuck in development hell for so long mad max fury road manages to live up to the hype maybe i wont place george miller in my top 5 directors but he comes pretty damn close with this movie everything is awesome in this movie the action sequences the cinematography the performances the visuals junkie xls soundtrack all the effort miller went through to get this movie off the ground finally paid off the best thing about it 34 of the effects are incamera no cgi mostly practical yes even that firespewing guitar is a real prop it also deals with the theme of feminism as well as aliens did back in 1986 no stereotypical woman talks down her mean boss feminism done right its difficult to say anything about this movie that other people havent already but mad max fury road deserves its positions as one of the greatest action movies of all time one of the best movie sequels of all time and the best mad max movie out of the four
Mar 1 2019,positive,intense and action packed from beginning to end mad max fury took me for one hell of a ride leaving me breathless and satisfied like few other action films today could ever hope to
Mar 1 2019,positive,just as any fan of the franchise would expect this movie is actionpacked as a matter of fact it can be considered one giant epic action sequence whatï 12tms surprising is that fury roadï 12tms storyline never gets neglected most action movies especially summer blockbusters have a tendency to suffer from a lack of development in their storytelling among its many strong points mad max fury road manages to develop its characters as well as introduce different story arcs at a very fast pace all of that while blowing up cars blasting old school rock music and giving the audience some incredible one liners tom hardy also gives an incredible performance considering that max rockatansky is not a very talkative character and that most of his lines consist of a maximum of five or six words charlize theron also manages to steal the show as furiosa a character so loved by the audience that the studio is currently in talks to get her own spin off movie on the road no pun intended
Feb 28 2019,neutral,regarded as a classic already but in 10 years mission impossible fallout will be remembered far more kindly 
Feb 28 2019,positive,absolute classic one of the best action movies of all time so want them to work out the legal issues and get us a sequel
Feb 27 2019,positive,the movie that rekindled my interest in action movies the cinematography is astounding espically when you realize that most of the things on the screen isnt visual effects
Feb 26 2019,positive,87100    among the best adventure films very good action without a lot of cgi and an impeccable soundtrack the ending could have been better but it works and the villain does not really intimidate me 
Feb 22 2019,negative,if you liked this you are more twisted than the enslaved albinos
Feb 20 2019,positive,awesome movie  great action
Feb 17 2019,positive,there are lots of great actions flicks usually at least 23 every year  max max fury road is far more than that  it is an absolute masterpiece with heartpounding visceral visual storytelling unmatched by any movie in recent memory    it is the embodiment of the phrase every frame a painting but it takes multiple viewings to grasp all of the little details packed into every single frame of this movie    it should go on just about everyones watchbeforeyoudie list  an absolute achievement in what cinema can be
Feb 15 2019,negative,this was atrociously bad on all levels and not really even mad maxthe plot is sjw crap and action massively overrat4ed and charliez never was that hot
Feb 15 2019,positive,fury road is postapocalyptic carnage it has everything you want from spectacular imagery to a furious heroine who lives up to her name all with a tempo that never slows this film takes action to the max
Feb 13 2019,positive,original with great action scenes and brilliant music the plot is feminist but doesnt rub your face in it  ie how it should be done
Feb 11 2019,positive,this was a very good original entertaining film great cinematography original concept a little weird and different from anything ive seen before however i cant say it blew me away or provoked some sort of innate feeling or thought its worth watching but was overhyped in my opinion    i really enjoyed the fact that there was no forced romance and no sappy background story about why the girl didnt have an arm the film didnt try to fulfill any cliche expectations
Feb 7 2019,positive,i cannot stress enough how much i enjoy this movie not only from an entertainment standpoint but from an overall movie production it is in a league of its own from the acting to the sets the score to the action it is hard to find a piece of criticism with this masterpiece in a world full of remakes and reboots this movie reigns above all else and will be difficult to duplicate it is a true rock opera of chaos
Feb 5 2019,positive,this is my favorite tom hardy movie
Jan 28 2019,negative,a truly awful triumph of style over content
Jan 19 2019,positive,warning mild spoilers   i will have to start my movie critic journey with one of my alltime favorite movies and arguably the best action movie ever before this movie i have never watched any one of the mad max films its one of those days where you dont have any idea about the movie but end up shattering all your expectations and you just came out of the theater ecstatic i couldnt believe what i saw  the movie redefined the postapocalyptic action genre and made all the recent action movies like fast and furious franchise marvel franchise look childish it did it with mind boggling visuals and perfectly orchestrated stunts the most surprising one was the film was directed by an veteran guy whose last film was happy feet    coming to the movie it exists in an postapocalyptic future following an energy crisis the highlight of plot was the female protagonist named furiosa charlize theron who was the imperator of the main antagonist immortal joe who resides in citadel five woman who were selected for breeding with immortal joe were taken by furiosa in a war rig to save them and take them to a safe place she was supposed to go to fetch gasoline but when immortal joe found out that the wives have been missing he leads his entire army to capture furiosa and wives calling on the aid of nearby gas town and the bullet farm the group finds a support in max tom hardy who is the main male protagonist he is an universal donor captured for donating blood to one of the war boys named nux who also joined the pursuit in capturing furiosahe later turns against the immortal joe and gets killed    after going to the safe place called the green place in the film its where furiosa was born and was kidnapped as a child furiosa discovered that it was destroyed due to severe drought and got more support in her clan they return back to citadel again as max made them realize that it has resources full of water and food and its th eonly way out while they were headed to citadel they kill the immortal joe and trap all the war boys by blocking the canyon path    the movie is little less in plot but the cgi were so good that it completely overshadows the plot especially there is a scene where furiosa and the team were chased into a desert storm the visuals were in the scene were so good it puts the scene probably into one of my top 3 scenes of all time the movie also didnt deviate by placing any romantic scenes between furiosa and max nor by putting any flashback scenes which drag the movie and make it less interesting there were some glimpses of maxs past but thats about it    the energy was exhilarating right from start to finish the sound design editing music are arguably the best that the genre has ever seen the action scenes are so engrossing the movie captures the viewer mind and eyes right to the end even in the midst of chaotic action scenes the viewer can still follow the dynamics of the scene where all the war vehicles are located relative to each other and relative to the ground who died who attacked etc by constantly giving the viewer overhead shots mad max fury road is probably one of the best action movies made since terminator 2 is not an understatement    to quote one of the movie quotes    if im going to die im going to die historic on the fury road  nux
Jan 19 2019,positive,this film has a really bad story the feminist bull that they try to find in it is objectively reaching as the director himself debunked such assertions but a good story told poorly is always worse than a bad story told excellently the world is brought to life by the extremist war boys and immortal joeor is it imortan the action displays their insanity and the savageness of this post apocalyptic world the characters arent particularly interesting this is an experience before it is a movie my personal favorite mad max film and brings as much of a sense of direction and tone as the first while not nearly as deep
Jan 17 2019,positive,its a visual masterpiece almost a single twohour action scene there isnt a moment that goes by that the scenery isnt jawdropping the soundtrack stirring and the action blistering highly insist on watching it with boxxy software app
Jan 15 2019,positive,this is one of those films that just has everything with a strong cast and premise its hard not to love what youre watching here
Jan 14 2019,negative,you know what youre getting adrenaline filled fast and furious on lsd with shock value and things that go boom if youre into that sort of thing it still takes a certain type of person to want to watch this again
Jan 13 2019,negative,awful movie one big car chase with literally nothing else no character development no backstory just painted up clowns in cars with guitars avoid like the plague
Jan 13 2019,negative,i feel like this was a cheap hollywood trick to put asses in the seats just to turn into a furiosa movie with max as some male idiot sidekickthe only thing entertaining is the admittance that the women gang destroyed their green paradise and then at the end the women waste all the water and let in far more people then their environment can sustain ensuring all the food will be gone there toolol women are terrible leaders the only smart move for max was that he moved on from that total disaster waiting to happen
Jan 11 2019,positive,why is max so mad on the furious street i liked it when people died
Jan 11 2019,positive,one of the best movies ive seen in a long time
Jan 11 2019,positive,witnesss incredible idea because when the levee breaks there will be no place to hide
Jan 7 2019,positive,charlize theron furiosa and tom hardy max rockatansky driving a massive armored truck try to outrun the ruthless warlord and his henchmen with a good speaker setup and loud sound big screen  id recommend it big time
Jan 2 2019,positive,in just the first 30 minutes fury road already incomparably outdoes any of its predecessors and then you get 90 more minutes of the same exquisitely painted jaw ripping dropping action
Dec 31 2018,positive,a great addition to the mad max family the early capture and attempt to escape scene was enjoyable it had more dark hills have eyes elements throughout the movie than in previous mad max installments the chase throughout the film is well done and the suspense in the road hazards and realistic panic that would happen in a long drawn out escape make the movie towards the end it gets a bit more formulaic for mad max fans and even a one armed charlize theron with warpaint and skull tattoos still looks to sexy to live in the end times but i will take that as an added bonusmy only gripe is less a gripe and more a disappointment the supporting cast out side of theron and maybe hugh keaysbyrne were pretty generic even for a mad max film you can thoroughly enjoy this movie without knowing or caring about any of the side characters which is good and bad
Dec 29 2018,positive,entertaining with intense and gritty action sequences i found fury road  entertaining enough the actions sequences were amazing as were the brilliant visual effects and thumping background score which made up for its thinly written plot the sandstorm sequence was simply the best brilliant visual effects  a thrilling ride
Dec 28 2018,positive,this is what a sequel is supposed to be tom did a great job as the lead role one of the best action movies ever filmed 
Dec 21 2018,positive,striking and pointed but for what
Dec 20 2018,positive,is a shame they dont have more stars awesome movie 
Dec 15 2018,negative,all style and bad acting
Dec 14 2018,positive,watching mad maxfury road felt like being on the fastest and most extreme roller coaster in the world you just have so much fun that you just do not want to get off it but in all seriousness this film is a magnificent achievement by george miller and his crew not to mention the cast lead by tom hardy and charlize theron
Dec 12 2018,positive,no matter the films editing picture plot actors acting skills special effects or sound effects people can be dazzled just like a twohour wild life journey a deep action movie tomhardy is so good i love him
Dec 8 2018,positive,it a blockbuster movie of hollywood i like the background music during action  chasing sequences
Nov 27 2018,positive,fury road is action cinema at its best
Nov 27 2018,negative,i grew up with and loved the original mad max movies and apocalypse is a big favorite genre for me that being said i did not enjoy this movie the first or second times i watched it and i will hopefully never try to watch it again  furry road is easily the most overrated garbage scifi to ever reach the big screen  false flag critics thought it was going to win big oscars as a strike against the man for feminism or some garbage but all it ended up winning were sound and fx awards nothing important well not the big awards  i was actually offended by the terrible story stodgy acting and dodgy script  it is easily one of the worst rebootsremakessequels of all time which is a scathing review in an era where more than 70 of films that open in cinemas circa 20102020 fall into this category  i have loved theron in the past but her hyper feminism is starting to turn my stomach hardymax is the title character sort of and had no lines and when you could make them out they were corny as hell in really weird inconsistent accents  i wouldnt force my worst enemy to watch this movie and certainly wouldnt chastise anyone who wanted to turn it off in the first 15 minutes  everything in the movie except the consistent color pallet crumbles under even the slightest scrutiny  in all honesty anyone giving this more than 510 doesnt have a mind to review anything
Nov 22 2018,positive,mad max fury road has its fair share of plot and character problems but charlize therons excellent perfomance alongside a fantastic set of cinematography action and score make up for its problems 7510
Nov 18 2018,negative,they should be called the film feels road its not mad max at all its garbage
Nov 7 2018,positive,this was the movie michael bay always wanted to makebut just couldnt have watched few times using boxxy software  awesome soft
Oct 29 2018,positive,buckle up and sit tight for this adrenaline pumping thrill ride this is the fourth installment in the mad max franchise as we navigate the apocalyptic wastelands of australia we are guided by max as he tries to survive by teaming up with a fierce woman named furiosa the action starts immediately and doesnt let up the film paces itself perfectly you never feel a scene is dragged out with a complimenting score that combines classical orchestra with synth wave music adding to the action and intensity of each scene the impressive stunts will leave you speechless as stunt men vault from vehicles during a highspeed pursuit the costume design is noteworthy as each actor is transformed into an apocalyptic survivor that is almost unrecognizable combined with marvelous acting by tom hardy max charlize theron furiosa and nicholas hoult nux gives the movie mad max fury road is not just the best film in the franchise but one of the best action movies to date
Oct 27 2018,positive,a very fun and action pact movie thats very hard to not get drawn in by its scope and ideas
Oct 24 2018,positive,one of the best action movies ive ever seen its so amazing
Oct 22 2018,positive,this movie felt like an epic western with a modern postapocalyptic twist the greatness was in the the sort of passiveness of furiosa and maxs personalitieswhich was vastly overshadowed by the utter chaos that is constantly unfolding around them it was like a stillness within a storm
Oct 22 2018,negative,so charlize is the desert warrior
Oct 17 2018,positive,love them all but this is the best one this movie is full on impact especially considering the movie is driving full throttle one direction and then being like eh and turning around and going back thats literally the plot 
Oct 16 2018,positive,im happy i have boxxy software where i always find great movies
Oct 13 2018,negative,it has little in common with the original its mainly a very violent chase scene with lots of weird vehicles and people throughout the entire movie not really much of a plot or acting i guess the vehicles are the real stars lots of cgi and special effects i bought the dvd for 374 from a walmart discount bin i kept watching because i saw the original three movies in the theater but i wouldnt give it a 2nd view they should do a remake of the original
Oct 11 2018,positive,sorry not even close to mad max beyond thunder dome or mad max 2   lots of quick shots and terrible dialog but still entertaining 
Oct 7 2018,positive,an amazing ride from start to finish tim hardy gives a great performance as max and has great chemistry with colead charlize theron who gives a great performance in her own right
Oct 6 2018,positive,disappointing but still pretty entertaining
Oct 5 2018,positive,greatest action movie ever made dont try and deny it what is better than a movie with almost no dialogue no bullshit exposition every time a god damn character is introduced and no shot wasted admit it you fucks its the best action movie at the very least of the 21st century
Oct 3 2018,positive,just the best 2015s movie 
Sep 30 2018,positive,very good movie it mixes action with thriller whose intensity is driven by emotion as much as it is by motion this movie will melt your face off
Sep 27 2018,positive,this is a pretty good movie so far but honestly what the cagily duckies going on if it was an apoacalypse i sure as hell wouldnt start shooting fucking fire in death trap cars just use normal cars not that hard oh also dont smear paint on you simple requests for some whack ass people this movie is literally bumper cars with spikes and flames these fucking cars are blowing up after a fucking helmet hits into it
Sep 24 2018,negative,no this was not a good movie not that it was a bad movie but it lacked any real substance think of it as an overpriced 2 hour chase scene with incredible fx and almost zero character development
Sep 22 2018,positive,one of the best action movie i have ever seen
Sep 22 2018,positive,as action films go this is masterful filmmaking from the original director of the first mad max film of 1979
Sep 19 2018,positive,amazing definitely one of my top favourite movies i loved the composition
Sep 19 2018,positive,amazing nonstop action
Sep 11 2018,positive,great movie i love all the mad max movies
Sep 10 2018,neutral,this movie is visually beautiful but there isnt much of a story
Sep 5 2018,negative,absolute waste of time literally no story and just a 2 hour car chase sequence even the action is not that good
Sep 3 2018,positive,oh what a day what a lovely day
Aug 23 2018,neutral,shouldve been called the furiosa story  max has been relegated to a secondary character in a thirdrate story  its all been done before and been done more effectively  efficiently  all flash and a little bit of fury
Aug 21 2018,positive,just watch it
Aug 20 2018,positive,everything about this movie is perfect in my eyes the directing the acting the cinematography the music the visual effects the stunts as well as the deep underlying message it has to share but above all else mad max fury road is one of if not the best action movies ever made in movie history
Aug 16 2018,positive,pretty great movie  an interesting take on a post appocolyptic world
Aug 12 2018,negative,awful dont waste your time 
Aug 8 2018,positive,best action movie ever
Aug 6 2018,positive,just re watched it and it is very very good post apocalyptic mayhem and craziness awesome stunt work and cool drivingfighting scenes i hope they make more
Aug 4 2018,positive, in fury road mad max steps aside and the girls drive     when i bought my ticket to see mad max fury road i had never seen a single mad max movie in my life i knew it was an australian dystopian franchise from the 80s starring mel gibson and had a substantial cult following but not much else so when i eased into my seat i was pretty unprepared for the visual and thematic feast about to unfold before me    like its predecessors fury road is set in a grim desert wasteland where water and oil are scarce pockets of surviving humans are desperate for resources and power and nobody has more of either than immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne    fury road begins with max as a prisoner of joes war boys an army immortan joe has bred himself using sex slaves    things kick into high gear when furiosa charlize theron dark places a mysterious lieutenant in joes army is sent across the desert to fetch oil joe discovers that furiosa has broken his five wives free from their prison and stowed them in her oil rig max is thrown into the action when his captors engage in a massive desert chase against furiosa who is bound and determined to reach an oasis called the green place    if max seems like a bit of a footnote here he is furiosa and the women are the heart and soul of fury road championing female life and autonomy into something that could have easily been a popcorn flick for bros    when max joins the women on their rig initially selfpreservation is his only goal but these women two of whom are pregnant show him what it means to want survival  not only for yourself but for your children and a future world as well    its not a perfect movie or one thats universally appealing nearly the whole twohours is a car chase which can be tiring if youre not into that sort of film tom hardy the revenant delivers a somewhat vague performance at times its not easy to engage with his character the action is continuous the roars loud and the explosions vivid    but on the whole fury road impresses and surprises more than almost any other 2015 release as evidenced by its 6 oscar wins movie nerds especially will be thrilled to watch the energy and prowess of incredible stunt performers casual filmgoers will be delighted to see the tactile grit of real choreography and real explosions after a decade of shiny computergenerated stunts in almost every other action flick    as a writer my handsdown favourite aspect of the film is the utter restraint displayed by the screenwriters putting good scifi on screen is no easy feat it can be way too tempting to get bogged down in tons of unrealistic expository dialogue and explanations of the world and its culture      but mad max suffers from none of these rookie mistakes it truly knows how to show not tell we arent told why furiosa has a mechanical arm but we understand that shes a warrior who realised she wants to fight for life instead of slavery we dont need definitions of the terms valhalla or blood bag or the history of gas town and its relationship to the citadel were swept up in the chase the fights the conversations and were told just enough to keep us engrossed    at the end of the night fury road offers us a wellmade tightlywritten critique of greed oppression and dehumanisation it may be a bumpy ride but its a ride like youve never taken before        this review was first published on narrative muse  and was written debbie holloway narrative muse curates the best books and movies by and about women and nonbinary folk on our website  and our social media channels
Aug 4 2018,positive,from start to the end this movie is pure unstoppable adrenaline rush thats take no prizoners basing whole movie on practical effects makes all the insane action more reall then in any other movie this is 100  pure action movie that knows it and its here to deliver fun and excitment
Aug 1 2018,positive,mad max fury road is one of a kindnot only the best movie of 2015 but one of the best action movies of all time
Jul 30 2018,positive,best action movie ever 
Jul 29 2018,positive,i never expected to come out of mad max feeling so exhilarated but damn this one solid action movie fury road relentlessly hammers the audience with raw brutal imagery and octane fueled action miller has done the unthinkable and has gone beyond expectations now where is our furiousa follow up
Jul 26 2018,positive,i own this and it gets better with every viewing i highly recommend thisbut dont show it to your kids its got disturbing and scary images
Jul 20 2018,positive,in my opinion the best film of 2015 perfect scenes of the pursuit brilliant pictures and an innovative project a bow to the creator
Jul 20 2018,negative,apocalyptic pretension
Jul 18 2018,negative,didnt like it too much make up and moving partsno match for original movie which budget was a tenth
Jul 15 2018,positive,i liked the original better mildly disturbing in the typical mad max way
Jul 13 2018,negative,not a max fan at all just seems to lack plot
Jul 13 2018,positive,who could have expected this sequel to be soo goodone of the most visually and soundly epic movies
Jul 8 2018,positive,this is one of the best looking films i have ever seen    plot is not complex  max is not the start of this film  i just gave all the things people could complain about  any other complaint should be ignored
Jul 4 2018,positive,for me this movie was in the category i havent watched this yet but people are saying its really masterpiece i know that i needed to find time to watch it earlier i did it yesterday using boxxy software and i regret that i didnt watch it beforewhen you know that everything you watch is for free and your software is for free its the real pleasure
Jul 3 2018,positive,i love the world dir george miller created it was visually stunning for a deserted apocalyptic world that was very much dead and barren making it hauntingly beautiful besides the visual aspects the characters and dynamics of the world were intriguing and although they were otherworldy it was very much reflective of our own making this movie so much more than a typical apocalypse action film
Jul 3 2018,positive,this movie is epic everything  music direction acting  cinematography just amazing charlize is badass the heroine we need
Jul 1 2018,positive,genius choreography and cinematography fit like a puzzle piece with this films story and environment that is truly dripping with substance and style oh and its also damn awesome to watch spiky cars be torn apart by explosions suicide bombers and george millers intense dedication to glorious practical effects i like this movie a lot
Jun 24 2018,positive,wow in my top 5 of all time a masterpiece
Jun 23 2018,positive,mad max fury road is nothing short of the best action film of all time absolute perfection is achieved in every department  the writing characters design cinematography and absolutely everything else are all topnotch the only fault that comes to mind with george millers masterpiece here is that i dont think any other action film will ever be able to top this
Jun 21 2018,positive,1010  with an absorbing story great performances and the highoctane action the franchise is known for mad max fury road successfully brings the series back to life
Jun 19 2018,positive,its official mel gibson is no longer mad max    the surprise hit of the summer was a visual spectacle that raised the bar for the summer blockbuster george miller at age 70 beautifully showcased the true vision he had for the dystopian future he first put on screen 35 years ago    on the backdrop of a harsh landscape and reality the lead character with out using much dialogue except for grunts and groans tries to overcome a tormented past and survive when put like that mad max fury road is essentially the revenant with much better car chases furiosa played by charlize theron is the real focus of the film she was the one who carried the movie giving us a heroine on par with the likes of ellen ripley from the alien series or sarah conner from terminator the plot isnt over complicated and the storys foundation is strong which allows for the creative direction of the movie  for example how the movies score blends with and often is provided by the characters on screen  finally the practical effects and stunt work were stunning maybe one day they will turn mad max fury road into a cirque de soleil show  ill be first in line
Jun 19 2018,positive,this this is an action movie i hate action movies because the stories are often vapid the story in mad max fury road is meaningful its powerful and its matched only by the stunning cinematography this movie is gorgeously shot and perfectly edited every action scene is natural it isnt forced even if there are some very choreographed scenes it works and considering the movement of the vehicles as these shots take place it feels real im sure there are some effects used but the scale is epic and reminds me of the intensity of the chariot races in benhur simply said this movie is brilliant
Jun 18 2018,positive,my favourite movie of all time a cinematic masterpiece
Jun 17 2018,positive,this movie is amazing if i had to pick something i didnt like my only complaint is that i didnt want it to end the action the cars the acting the characters the plot excellent all the way around ive watched it around 20 times and it still blows me away
Jun 17 2018,positive,tremendous action film  great movie
Jun 16 2018,positive,best chase movie ever made its up there
Jun 14 2018,negative,what was the story about

Jun 8 2018,positive,wow shockingly surprised how good this was top 25 all time vastly underrated
Jun 3 2018,positive,amazinginly fun movie with nonstop action  must watch
Jun 3 2018,positive,the second best of the mad max movies behind max max beyond thunderdome i know im in the minority with my rankings but thunderdome rocks the house  not only is it a great apocalypse movie but a great car chase movie  the character development was great and tom hardy does a great job replacing mel gibson as mad max  im at a busy stage in life where having time to watch a movie is a rare guilty pleasure and ill gladly take that fleeting moment to sneak a peak of fury road
Jun 2 2018,positive,best action movie ever
Jun 2 2018,positive,one of the best displays of filming ever to take place  the most unbelievable thing about this movie is that nobody was seriously injured or died while on set  everything is real and not enhanced through the use of computers  acting is top notch charlize theron  tom hardy does not speak too much throughout the movie but his quietness is able to speak volumes for how fantastic of a movie this is
May 31 2018,negative,appalling film  cgi and nothing else dreadfulsound cgi and basically everything apart form c therons acting ability through this crap shold not have wasted the money please please stop making this rubbish
May 31 2018,negative,i forced myself to sit through this awful movie it redeemed itself with some good visuals at times
May 28 2018,positive,fastpaced intense and beautifully filmed mad max fury road has nonstop action brilliant performances and just enough dramatic heft to keep the audience interested until the end 
May 28 2018,positive,rarely are remakes better than the first but fury road captured all the good of the original mad max lore without the slow nature of the first   one of my favorite movies of all time
May 24 2018,positive,what a very silly film great fun to watch though  i can never get over the invincibility of the main protaginists despite some death along the way and the ending was a bit twee  however the action was superb and the guitar wagon was a great touch
May 21 2018,positive,mad max fury road  the name of the film is fury road it was directed by george miller and the  main characters are mad max who is played by tom hardy furiosa who is  played by charlize theron and nux who is played by nicholas hoult  years after the collapse of civilization the tyrannical immortan joe enslaves  apocalypse survivors inside the desert fortress called the citadel when the  warrior imperator furiosa leads the despots five wives in a daring escape she  forges an alliance with max a loner and former captive fortified in the  massive armored truck the war rig they try to outrun the ruthless warlord and  his henchmen in a deadly highspeed chase through the wasteland  the plot seems to be absorbing  the special effects are outstanding and stunning  the photography is really incredible and impressive  the acting performance is spectacular believable and powerful  the writting script is thoughtprovoking compelling and moving  i find this film absolutely fascinating and compelling if you havent seen it  yet you dont know what you have been missing fury road is one of my  favourite films in the world
May 18 2018,negative,will never watch this movie again no plot waste of time terrible 
May 18 2018,positive,an action masterpiece 100 pure adrenal awesomeness
May 12 2018,positive,probably the best action you can see in a film and almost certainly the best action film in recent years despite a limited role for tom hardy as max he serves as the thread of the film though he is overshadowed by charlize theron as furiosa who is de facto the main character and protagonist of this film all round great film shame it didnt do better at the box office
May 10 2018,positive,great cast plenty of action and a deep enough story to supplement the shootout scenes
May 9 2018,negative,overhyped weak story weak characters all cgi no soul
May 6 2018,negative,given the outstanding reviews i expected a much better movie than this the entire movie is basically a car chase with no plot and no context sure its very spectacular and wellfilmed but only that doesnt make a good movie disappointed
May 4 2018,positive,mad max fury road brings everything that we liked with the mad max franchise and puts it in a long epic action movie
May 4 2018,negative,are you friends with moths do you sympathise with them bursting into flames when navigating their way into a fire    then this movie is for you    with a total lack of any semblance of a developed story or decent dialogue you get to watch an action packed movie filled with fire explosions loud noises and crazy music did i mention mechanical monstrosities well then youre in for a treat because they drive from point a to point b
May 2 2018,positive,very simple story but a case study in great filmaking in continuity and grand action
Apr 30 2018,positive,having never seen and of the other mad max films i went into this blind on a random night with a buddy of mine within the first few minutes of them film i was absolutely blown away beautiful cinematography awed me and captivating characters made me wanting more i only hope more comes of this new entry in the franchise
Apr 27 2018,positive,absolutely gripping from start to finish  also stunning cinematography
Apr 23 2018,positive,mad max fury road  4 out of 5 great all out action film not much plot to this film it starts with action and never really stops if your looking for a oscar type film this is not for you if you are looking for a visually beautiful fast paced crazy out there action with big explosions this is for you i absolutely loved this film everyone should go see it on the big screen and buy it when it comes out
Apr 21 2018,positive,a fun thrilling and exiting film with great action packed chases both charlize theron and tom hardy are great and this film was just a fun ride
Apr 3 2018,positive,brilliant basically
Apr 2 2018,positive,easily one of the best action movies ever made
Apr 2 2018,negative,the movie has no meaning at all the plot is terrible and the guitar playing guy is idiotic sure it has cool fight scenes but overall the movie is not good not worth the oscars
Mar 30 2018,positive,movie as a whole is great has nothing to do with mad max this is a feminist action movie its ok but would have been better with a believable hero and not invincible marysue armless lady
Mar 30 2018,positive,this is one of my favorite movies gorgeously shot wonderfully acted well paced with everything you want from a postapocalyptic desert destruction derby
Mar 28 2018,positive,this film is insanely good i was a little skeptical when i heard they were making another mad max movie and then they replaced gibsonbut this is a rip roaring thrill ride of carnage and destruction that harks back to the best moments of the franchise and gives you realistic white knuckle action in spades  an absolute blockbuster proving again that the overuse and reliance on cgi has ruined the action genre
Mar 21 2018,positive,wholly engaging and visually epic  didnt want the ride to end
Mar 21 2018,positive,although it does not have too much of an original plot fury road successfully revives the mad max franchise in this thrilling action packed adventure that not only looks great but is also very well constructed  the characters are all rather well fleshed out and even though mel gibson is not in this movie tom hardy does rather well as max  overall this thrilling fourth instalment is a great success in filmmaking
Mar 19 2018,positive,delivers at every level an intelligent roller coaster of a movie the two leads are excellent and george milers vision  of an apocalyptic  world is stunning great sets and action sequences a solid supporting cast as good as it gets
Mar 18 2018,positive,this is hands down one of my favorite movies of all time if you have not seen it then i highly recommend it the actors were great the costumes and cars used in this film were awesome i am not really a fan of action films but this one was awesome
Mar 16 2018,positive,im going to be honest this is the only mad max movie ive seen and i know almost nothing about the other ones the fact that i still love this movie is a good indication that it can stand on its own the story and characters are simple but effective and i can still get a good idea of whats going on despite not much being explained the movie is also basically a 2hour car chase with some of the best action in any movie ever that alone is enough to make me love it
Mar 7 2018,positive,an adrenaline rush in a high order of film making
Mar 6 2018,positive,best action movie of the 2000s   by far loved pretty much everthing about it
Mar 5 2018,positive,i love this movie the storyline is amazing but it depends on the type of genres you like so if you like postapocalyptic genres survival and action  this movie is for you
Mar 3 2018,positive,one of fave action movies i have seen this repeatedly  and will continue to do so the action is relentless and the characters compelling love love love it
Feb 28 2018,negative,one of the most overrated movies ever only saving grace was the stunts
Feb 25 2018,negative,bad movie it wont let me do 0 stars but thats what this movie earned
Feb 25 2018,positive,ambitious no doubt in many many ways  the action sequences the contraptions the costumes etc almost ridiculously manic at times yet comical in a very bmovie sort of way as a first time mad maxer im really not sure what to make of this was i supposed to be laughing at that ridiculous doublenecked guitar guy or crying for furiosa  or both think you gotta be all doped up to get into this really not for me weird
Feb 25 2018,positive,what this movie lacks in plot it makes up in visual brilliance  it doesnt waste time with lengthy or clunky exposition  this movie goes right into the action and proves that lives sets will always be better than an overdose of cgi  its hard to tell if this is a sequel or a reboot but by the end of the movie i assure you you wont care either way  watching this movie in hd4k ultra is like putting on a nice pair of glasses for the first time and the soundtrack is just as epic  this is a movie where you eat popcorn and let the movie overload your senses
Feb 25 2018,positive,violent and visceral but also very kinetic and superbly acted
Feb 12 2018,positive,now a lot of you snowflakes may call me a sexist but check me out i gave glowing reviews on the feminist movie proves that i am honest about my reviews not like you snowflake crybabies now back to the movie plenty of action and really like the dope mad motors
Feb 12 2018,positive,from beginning to end the movie keeps me on the edge of my seat with enough story telling to keep me informed mad max fury road is one of the fastest movie experiences ive ever experienced 
Feb 10 2018,positive,the best action movie in this century
Feb 9 2018,positive,if i could give this movie 10 stars i would
Feb 9 2018,positive,never quiet got the hyp personally thought it was an ok movie
Feb 5 2018,positive,title mad max fury road  storywritingmessageplot3  characteracting4  musicsound5  cinematographyediting5  ageoriginality4  total2125      simple story simple character with bold and amazing spectacle film is all about telling a story in visual way and mad max fury road is absolutely the best film that describe this this film proves us that a story that is as simple as driving out into the dessert and coming back can be a hurricane jet coaster ride the tempo is fantastic and though most of the film is action we do not get bored at the slightest the visual are beautiful there is minimal use of cg but used wisely and properly for maximum result we can feel the tension every time because they are real the music multiplies the world and every character are capable to be the main character no one is spoiled in this film there isnt much i can say but if i would have to say one negative thing is that i am worried if there is any sequel to be made it may not bring anything further then this fury road
Feb 4 2018,positive,one of the best movies i have ever seen story line is just so unpredictable weird and like nothing like ive seen before
Feb 1 2018,positive,i can recall being a huge skeptic about a modernized mad max film im very glad my skepticism was proven wrong as this turned out to be an unexpected masterpiece the film has plenty of strange tidbits and ideas that all worked wonderfully together from the unusually delivered dialogue to the outlandish characters to the dystopian culture imagined by george miller himself its an action thriller where the true treat of the film is not the action itself but rather its everything else surrounding it tom hardy helms the title role but its charlize theron who owns the film with the strongest performance out of everyone portraying a character of ferocity and guts who also has vulnerable side to her also recognition to an excellent supporting cast including keough kravitz hwhiteley and eaton as the wives and hoult as nux the war boy
Jan 28 2018,positive,craziness and madness its what i like about fury road its gorgeous to look at with great action pieces  it slows down as the movie goes and the ending leaves it feeling incomplete  overall still a great movie
Jan 27 2018,positive,am i the only one who thinks this is a bit overrated the set design and cinematography are phenomenal but the rest of it didnt seem all that special to me
Jan 23 2018,positive,one of the best action movies ever shot
Jan 22 2018,positive,beautifully shot and amazing action sequences directed brilliantly with amazing acting makes up what it lacks in a plot and is really spectacular
Jan 21 2018,positive,loved every minute of it hadnt expected to but i did  nostalgia critics review inspired me to watch it
Jan 20 2018,positive,wellmade and relentlessly exhilarating with fire and violence in bounds this is apparently all a film needs to be to consider it amongst the best of the 21st century i appreciate the talent involved in production but its just not for me
Jan 19 2018,neutral,this is an enjoyable blockbuster with moments of sheer brilliance  miller breathes life into the genre with incredible set pieces and some excellent visual humour and observations  the plot though is there even one there  not really  whatever people say about this film its basically mad max 2 updated you can never recreate the incredible unease tone and zeitgeist of that first film  in my opinion it will never be matched
Jan 17 2018,negative,a terrible nonsensical story with the title character mostly along for the ride
Jan 15 2018,positive,lots of cool action stuff going on with lots of characters that seem very interesting all set in a pretty nice looking shots in a cool looking place not bad at all just missing a particularly good story it wasnt bad just not the most interesting which meant that action didnt seem at high stakes because you didnt care about what it was all for so much
Jan 12 2018,positive,stunning i could watch this movie 100 times
Jan 11 2018,negative,mindless action flick with no purpose  take the car out turn around and go back  a masterpiece of mediocrity in screenwriting
Jan 10 2018,positive,ive never been a fan of action moviesbut this movie has intelligent intense and emotionally rich plot awesome world building and the most beautiful scenes my favorite movie
Jan 9 2018,negative,worst movie i have seen in the last decade
Jan 8 2018,positive,i could not believe that a fourth installment in a movie franchise could be this good  this movie takes the original idea developed in the part 2 and expands it into an even more frightful idea of dystopia that would probably depress you if it wornt for the main cast that blows you away with fantastic performance   it is often difficult to explain what does it mean when a movie has depth and fury road can serve as a reference point for it all the praises for what george miller achieved
Jan 4 2018,positive,i just love this movie the action set pieces blew me away even before i found it that it was made with mostly practical effects tom hardy can do no wrong and charlize theron is an outstanding lead female essentially making the film her own
Jan 4 2018,neutral,maybe my mistake was to watch it on the small screen
Jan 3 2018,positive,was kind of forced into watching this one but i really really enjoyed it it felt iconic politics or no politics you choose i choose to watch it without the meaningless feminist subtitles because it has incredible action stunts a good story and great acting it might not be pretty but every detail of the film is worth looking at and admiring for its intricacy not sure what the title character mad max had to do with anything but he was tom hardy so naturally brilliant to watch even if it was a question why he was relevant at all to the plot
Jan 2 2018,positive,fury road is one of the greatest action films ever made it features amazing practical effects and numerous dazzling shots and scenes the set and character designs are memorable and the film follows the rule of showing instead of telling  even though the plot is simple and straightforward there is more depth to these characters than one might think you will find yourself emotionally invested in them  most importantly though this has all the insanity and more that you would expect from a mad max movie its one of the most spectacular films ever made

Dec 16 2017,positive,a cinematic marvel that deserves a spot in every action movie lovers library
Dec 15 2017,neutral,its nice to have a story about women and some of the shots are beautiful but at the end of the day it really is just a movie about a long car chase it was very tiring
Dec 14 2017,negative,this film is little more than bells whistles and feminist tripe  barely acceptable casting zero character development a nonscript and a complete sense of why garbage  first to last minutes
Dec 9 2017,negative,did you see the trailer if so you saw all the parts worth watching
Dec 5 2017,positive,well after mad maxbeyond the thunderdome i was quite sceptical as to how this cultclassic saga might get back on the right track mad max and mad max road warrior were such superior that beyond thunderdome was a little bit of regression compared to them also a question was lingering would a new mad max movie have the same mindblowing effect 2015 as it had in 1980 to this question my answer was rather 5050 but george miller proved not only me but  i suppose many wrongthis guy is simply what you call a great director mad maxfury road takes its stand from road warrior but with the essence of the first movie tom hardy does a great job as max rockatansky but its charlize therons furiosa who stole the show indirectly this movie is a femalelead action packed explosive fun ridedazzling visuals mindblowing actions and a great performance by the lead as well as the secondary cast and the vision of a legend like george miller simply makes mad maxfury road one of the best movies of 2015 and certainly a cultclassic action movie which will be remembered for years just as its predecessors
Nov 30 2017,positive,absolutely epic movie
Nov 27 2017,negative,mindnumbing overrated fury road is a grotesque dustbowl carnage that is sustained by an ecstatic theological riff to valhalla beyond that this films succinct and thoroughly original screenplay has little else to say
Nov 26 2017,positive,insane action just phenomenal and along with that awesome performances this movie is a nonstop thrill ride i was on the edge of my seat the whole time future classic one of my favourite action films
Nov 21 2017,positive,this movie just drives me crazy you look for the word action in the dictionary and you will find this masterpiece
Nov 21 2017,negative,if i could give it no stars i would 
Nov 19 2017,positive,mad max fury road is the definition of pure knock your socks off entertainment with its extraordinary achievement in cinematic mastery mad max fury road is one of the best films of the last 10 years
Nov 18 2017,positive,witness me enough said
Nov 18 2017,positive,i love this movie for the same reasons as conan the barbarian 1980 the action is super clear filmed so that we really see what happens there the story is told very linear so that everyone can understand many say the story is so simple but i can not think outside the box because so little is said in this movie the action is super filmed almost praised actors give everything they can only by facial expressions and gesticulating because very little is talked about in this movie the music is cool yes im honest there are only two songs that i think are super blatantly the rest was okay
Nov 18 2017,positive,a movie full of action good storytelling great directing and perfect acting
Nov 17 2017,positive,in a world where dystopian futures tend to be overexplained in order to captivate audiences mad max simply show as a simple story immerse in a complex universe with a fuzzy line of good and wrong balancing the survival of the human race
Nov 12 2017,positive,this film has so many good qualities its hard to know where to start  charlize therons furious warriorwoman the nearmythic avatar of justice max rockastansky the breeding harem the insane aging warlord the custom designed vehicles the utter desperate bizarreness in a postapocalyptic culture etc all these things make this a very tight feature  but i could wax poetic on every scene about the timing and editing  this movie is put together so well i could set my heartbeat by it
Nov 10 2017,positive,possibly the best film ever made     a high octane adrenalin fuelled pig shit crazy pandemonious extravaganza of non stop action and wonder     this is a special film that will be watched by audiences for decades and decades to come     also i saw this both in 2d and in 4d and it was awesome both times in fact this is the best film i have seen in 4d ever
Nov 4 2017,negative,excruciating idiotic nonsense never in the field of human film making has so much technology and so much money been used by so many to make so much shit for so many morons harsh no fing way
Nov 2 2017,positive,sense of substitution
Oct 29 2017,positive,its an amazing film
Oct 26 2017,positive,a rare film that knows exactly what it is doesnt needlessly reach for something deeper and has a surprising amount of character the most focused and entertaining action movie ive seen in a long time
Oct 25 2017,negative,this film has no ascertainable plot and is merely an acrobatic car chase the film does not follow the rules of the mad mad universe in which it exists the primary rule being scarce resources must treated as scarce resources they waste water they destroy all their vehicles the use inordinate amounts of fuel even driving a stage featuring an electric guitar with a massive flame throwing tower amplification system to every battle they loose track of their only nonmutant women they waste bullets and despite existing in a post apocalyptic world all their vehicles are some how souped up and pimped out the actions of the characters just dont make sense when considering the ground rules which the series has created a science fiction movie can make up any rules it wants but then it must follow those rules the film has good acting and cinematography but does it really matter
Oct 22 2017,positive,this is a movie i had not seen until two years after its release i liked the film but some things just didnt make that much sense there is a lot going on at once and some of the stuff is just so random but they do a good job with it i really loved the character of furiosa in the movie the way they threw in some flashbacks at some points to help explain maxs backstory was more efficient in my opinion as opposed to if they just did a full 10 minute backstory on him and again with everything going on at once it probably wouldve been hard to do anyway the motivations of all the characters very clear and well thought out and the action was some of the best ive ever seen in a movie before
Oct 21 2017,positive,so good when youre high and when youre not high an academy award winning film full of action badass cars and an overall incredible film despite the simplicity of the storyline great costumes sets and props as well as award winning cinematography
Oct 20 2017,positive,20102017  crazy action masterpiece easily one of the greatest action films ever made right up there with terminator 2
Oct 16 2017,positive,pounding action and stunning choreography give mad max fury road a million thrillsand yet the plot satisfies as well
Oct 14 2017,positive,while a strong sense of discontinuity is there from the beginning the plot for mmfr makes itself clear over the course of the film unfortunately there is no real beginning for the characters the place the time it just is and we are made to accept it the end of civilization must be taken at face value in this iteration of the mad max franchise with no real connection to the first mad max or even road warrior this film is a close cousin to beyond thunderdome in its autocratic ruler of the mcguffin in thunderdome it was bartertown in fury road it is the clean water   the road sequences are thrilling and earshattering the action is incredible and the fight scenes are tough if not impossible to beat  i just wish there had been more connection to the previous max films without a need to have seen them all to understand what the heck is going on
Oct 12 2017,positive,best action movie ever
Oct 9 2017,positive,i thought it was okay at best
Oct 9 2017,positive,one of the best action movies of all time instant classic
Oct 8 2017,positive,mad max fury road exemplifies what a pure action film should be rather than having the action sequences support the story its the action that dominates the film and the action was done authentically and with style this is a film where you would want to watch over and over again just for the visual experience in addition the plot was straightforward and doesnt overindulge the audience in any way the backstories of the characters werent covered in the film however it is clear that during each characters short stage time a complex past can be inferred from their concise dialogues costumes props etc ex furiosas robotic arm was never covered in the film because it does not support the main story however it is still in the film ultimately this is a rare film where its creators had enough time to develop the story characters and action to last beyond its twohour film time
Sep 30 2017,positive,i liked this movie but at the beginning of it it didnt seem very well so my only problem with it that it was boring at the beginning but i really loved it and ill watching again and again and againcause it really was good   the characters was amazing story was good cgi great
Sep 29 2017,positive,perfect for its own kind of movies
Sep 27 2017,positive,mad max fury road is movie making at its very best
Sep 19 2017,negative,contentless bonanza of superfluous explosions masquerading as a plot   literally a car chase  one dimensional caricatured characterisation   distressingly frenetic edit   did not bang     all in all resoundingly undeserving of 6th place on best ever films list
Sep 19 2017,positive,mad max is back in this sequelreboot that blows the other mad max films out of the water in a matter of fact it blows most action films out of the water too this beautifully shot masterpiece has some of the best action scenes car chases and stunts that ive ever seen it hardly slows down for nothing but when it does we do have an interesting but familiar plot that works very well tom hardy was great fun as max i wouldnt mind seeing him take up the role again the effects and practical effects were all amazing i cant comment on the 3d as i watched the 2d version but im betting the 3d would of been great its not often a film lives up to the hype but fury road is a film that all action fans should watch as its a modern day classic in many ways
Sep 18 2017,positive,monster truck fest mixed with wells fargo coach of the far west lots of pursuits lots of indians left on the road plenty of shootings and plosions very long desertic road a few supermodels the whole thing is a stylised spectacle well choreographed with a story that would make sense if any of this had any sense to start with its a dance with lots of mechanics and spilt blood
Sep 18 2017,positive,one of the best films ive ever seen was on the edge of my seat throughout everything was amazing the music cars the action all brilliant
Sep 18 2017,positive,one of the most thrilling experiences i have ever had in a movie theater the movie looks sounds and feels fantastic
Sep 17 2017,negative,this movie is a joke and an insult to the road warrior  in addition to not having a plot isnt it ironic that nobody ever runs out of gas even after driving ridiculous monster trucks for 24hours straight considering thats what the road warrior was all aboutfuel  bad acting fake looking cinematography girl power total ripoff off the road warrior perfect tires and shiny new vehicles in a post apocalyptic world andmilk  im embarrassed for the director he obviously has the same syndrome as george lucas a new hopemad max empire strikes backroad warrior return of the jedibeyond thunderdome and finally jar jar binksfury road first movie good second movie better third movie worst and fourth movie being a complete disgrace to the franchise  i rest my case
Sep 11 2017,positive,to put it simply mad max fury road is one gigantic pile of vibrant colors in particular desert orange and deep blue metallic clamor and a whole bunch of insanity and i love every single second of it when i first watched it in the theater i felt like the movie had grabbed me by the throat and didnt let go until the end now a few years later even though i know what turns the movie makes i still get a sense of satisfaction watching it one sign of a good movie is that it keeps getting better each time you watch it ive rewatched fury road many times since its theatrical release but i havent yet grown tired of max furiosa the wives nux and immortan joe and his cronies this is a truly remarkable film for the action genre
Sep 8 2017,positive,simply actionpacked a great start if youre new to the franchise everything is so fastpaced that i feel i have to watch this multiple times to figure out the plot but nevertheless the costume design and special effects are great no wonder this movie won more than one oscar i will have to check out the older films
Sep 8 2017,positive,mad max fury road seems set to become a classic action movie like terminator 2 and die hard that you can watch again and again the premise is somewhat simple but the execution is excellent and the film actually has something to say in a post apocalyptic world gasoline is of great importance and water has become a luxury horded by tyrants like immortan joe who enslaves and uses young men as war boys to fight  die for him and young healthy women as wives to be used as breeders max played by tom hardy is captured by the war boys and is used as a blood bag for one of the war boys nux played by nicholas hoult on a run for gasoline the driver of a huge armoured war rig furiosa played by charlize theron drives off course and its discovered to have helped it joes wives escape and thats when the shit really hits the fan     this film is beautifully shot with great costumes and the action in this film is incredibly well done with the majority being practical stunts and effects in an almost relentless car chase that keeps ramping up the tension and the excitement for an action movie mad max has a surprising amount of depth and story to it and brings us a great new female action hero which are few and far between in the form of furiosa whose story the film focuses on rather than max overall an incredibly fun action packed film thats well worth watching the making of as well just for the stunts
Sep 5 2017,negative,if i had to recommend this movie for anything it would be for the grand final battle
Sep 4 2017,positive,this is a thundering return to the mad max series almost no action movie can top or rival it
Sep 4 2017,positive,good movie for teenagers and young adults great visual effects   worth to watch it one time overall okay movie 35
Sep 2 2017,positive,almost pure action and keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time loved the story too perfect movie in my eyes
Aug 30 2017,positive,mad max fury road has it all folksexcept for a mel gibson cameoor is there one youll have to see for yourself this movie delivers on every aspect acting filming script action etc it even hones in on some of the comedy of the original film series
Aug 30 2017,positive,the action sequences in this movie are so ridiculous and overthetop its incredible how the filmmakers still took the time to use their visuals to move plot points forward and the make the action creative the main characters are mostly likable if not very developed except nux and furiosa i liked these two characters the most 810
Aug 28 2017,positive,mad max fury road beautifully shot top notch special effects intensly crafted action scenes and surprisngly amount of narritve brings george millers postapocalyptic franchise roaring vigorously back to life
Aug 24 2017,positive,george millers mad max fury road has put modern action films to shame with gorgeous wide shots of destruction a near constant sense of urgency good characters and a suprisingly solitd story mad max fury road will be one of the gold standards for action movies for years to come
Aug 22 2017,positive,not only has it got a surprisingly meaty story and a great cast but is also incredibly entertaining with outrageous action sequences stunningly creative costume and set design and ridiculously eyepopping visuals its a sight to behold and one of the best to come out of the action genre in recent years
Aug 20 2017,positive,a thrilling and superbly shot film that conveys this bleak world quite perfectly
Aug 19 2017,positive,epic  visually stunning  charlize and tom hardy are excellent  great worldbuilding
Aug 18 2017,positive,it was okay i only watched it once cant decide if it merits a second time
Aug 16 2017,neutral,greg greg smith founder of agile writers of richmond va scott i thought we were done with the fast and furious series now we have fury road    scott dr scott allison professor of psychology university of richmond movie audiences appear to be clamoring for movies filled with endless car chases and with great fury and furiousness let s recap    greg in a future world where gas and water are scarce we re introduced to mad max max was apparently some sort of police officer who was charged with protecting women and children we learn this through flashbacks of little girls asking max  why didn t you save us  in accusatory tones max is taken hostage by the wild boys and hung from his heels in a cavern    scott we then see imperator furiosa charlize theron secretly steal five breeding wives of the tyrannical and maniacal immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne joe and his henchmen give chase using a strange assortment of battleequipped vehicles with max strapped to the hood of war boy nux s nicholas hoult car soon max escapes and joins forces with furiosa in an attempt to find a way home and to safety    greg scott this movie was one long chase scene there was hardly any time to create a plot but there is one furiosa is trying to get these five young woman back to her homeland  the green place when they arrive the land is dead and the only alternative is to go back where they came from it s a very basic story just enough to justify all the car mania i have to say though i was impressed it s dazzling display of roadwork and a nightmarish vision of the future most people i ve talked to were impressed by two things the guy playing electric guitar on the front of a war vehicle and how hot charlize theron looked despite being hairless and having just one arm    scott greg mad max fury road is a stunning technical and actionadventure achievement the look of the movie is unlike anything i ve ever seen the surreal visuals of the characters and their bizarre motor vehicles are simply incomparable this dystopian vision of humanity s future is disturbing yet creatively appealing now having said that i was disappointed with the complete lack of character development and storyline we are never introduced to the main characters these characters just show up and are being chased hounded and tortured by immortan joe and his minions i suppose i should root for them because they seem less dislikeable and bizarre than joe and his gang but we have no way of knowing if they are worthy of our support there simply is no backstory to any of these characters all we have is one heartpalpitating car chase scene after another yes these chases were fun but i hoped for much more from a storyline and character development point of view    greg the star of this film was definitely the world created by director george miller and writers mccarthy and lathouris we can only judge the characters by what they do rather than what they might say max spends most of his time in the movie being victimized by others he shows he s not a bad guy because instead of killing furiosa when he has the chance he merely shoots the sand around her he s not a killer it seems later when he has the chance to go his own way he instead chases down furiosa and her clan to convince them they are going the wrong way then he helps them to create a plan to return to the citadel where there is ample food water and gas so he s a good guy after all but we can only learn this through his choices rather than anything he says    scott i agree that max and furiosa follow the arc of the buddy hero story in that they are two people thrown together who dislike each other at first but slowly develop a strong bond the villains in this story depart from the usual pattern that we see in the movies greg usually the mastermind villain in this case immortan joe is a man who calls all the shots from afar safe from any harm only his minions and henchmen come in harm s way but in this movie joe is in on the action in a big way and he ultimately gets his comeuppance at the end overall the supporting cast is as memorable if not more memorable than our two heroes this may be the case partly because the two main characters are so poorly developed but also because the supporting cast members show some depth not to mention unusual behaviors and vivid makeup and costuming props go out to immortan joe and slit as the memorable villains and to the friends and allies of our two buddy heroes specifically the five breeding women and nux the badguyturnedgoodguy    greg it s interesting to see the transformation in a secondary character such as nux he starts out literally living off of max s blood and chasing the escaping brides he s a bad guy being lead by a dark mentor joe but he soon falls in love with one of the brides and becomes one of the good guys here is a secondary character who undergoes a moral transformation in the end he martyrs himself to save max furiosa and the remaining brides he is a heroic redeemed sidekick i enjoyed mad max fury road more than i expected to despite the lack of plot i was entertained by the imaginative and detailed dystopian future created by director miller i was drawn into the relentless chase and was able to appreciate the transformation of our buddy heroes as well as the sidekick i give mad max 3 out of 5 reels while max and furiosa don t really create an alliance until the midpoint of the story it s clear we re witness to a convergent buddy story our two heroes couldn t be farther apart at the beginning of the movie but their common desire to escape the villain immortan joe and find a safe place draws them together i liked this buddy story and gave them 4 out of 5 heroes the supporting cast was interesting as well i ve already talked about the evolution of sidekick nux the five brides pretty much played the damsels in distress aside from an occasional opportunity to reload guns their job was to look beautiful and be rescued the villains were more interesting than usual immortan joe certainly played the classic mastermind villain although as you point out scott he definitely got his hands dirty joe had his own henchman in slit and countless nameless and faceless minions but there was a nice addition of three other factions of bad guys each with their own mastermind villaintwo warring factions came to joe s aid and the gas guzzling motorcycle gang chimed in to help our heroes sadly we didn t get much depth to their characters so i give the supporting cast 3 out of 5 cast points  movie  cast  hero     scott mad max fury road is a visual spectacle and dazzling feast for the eyes and ears but there is little substance in the form of storyline and character development if you enjoy the fast and furious franchise you ll enjoy this movie i ll give this this film credit for being highly memorable in terms of makeup costuming cinematography and visual effects but i can t give any movie high marks without good meaty characters that we get to know as a result i can only award mad max fury road 2 reels out of 5 our two buddy heroes max and furiosa were disappointing because we never get to know them there is no backstory and almost no dialogue whatsoever that can give us insight into their values their history or their character as such they do not change over the course of the movie other than they grow to like each other and depend on each other for survival let s face it  this is an action movie that assumes perhaps correctly that audiences only want chase scenes i can only award these two flimsy heroes 1 hero out of 5 the supporting cast was more interesting than our two heroes we re not given much insight about immortan joe or any backstory either but he is obviously a deranged maniacal cult leader with loads of charisma max and furiosa s friends and allies play a nice supporting role and as you point out greg nux is the one character albeit a supporting character who undergoes a transformation i ll agree with your rating and assign this group a rating of 3 casts out of 5  movie  cast   hero
Aug 13 2017,positive,this a fantastic fastpaced action film that is visually spectacular storyline isnt exactly original or sophisticated but its a complete film nonetheless with top notch execution
Aug 12 2017,positive,george miller revives his long dead franchise with new found energy and narrative heist and nonstop action scenes mad maxs apocalyptic franchise comes roaring vigorously back to life while being exciting and visual pleasurable to watch
Aug 9 2017,positive,super intense action  better than the road warrior
Aug 9 2017,positive,this is my new favorite movie  the score is one of the best ive heard in my life and the way it pairs with the visuals takes it to a whole new level    the caliber of nonverbal acting that charlize theron and tom hardy achieve is the best i think ill probably ever see  the evolution of their characters as they reluctantly come to rely on the other being there is palpable and the lack of dialogue in the beginning throws that into sharper contrast    i can see how a diehard mad max fan wouldnt like it because its not about max  but if you let that go and accept it for what it is  an independent story from mel gibsons character  you open yourself to a mindblowing cinematic experience      the amount of care and attention to detail in the vehicles and the stunts is very rare in the age of digital enhancement and you can tell the difference  the more i learn about this movie the more i come to respect and appreciate all the scenes    this is a movie you can watch over and over again and still not be able to tear your eyes away from the screen
Aug 8 2017,positive,there wont be another action movie like this one mad max fury road is an intense journey that you want to repeat again and again
Aug 2 2017,positive,its in my top 5 best action movies ever for sure a rare case of an genre thats usually ignored in the awards season but the amazing storyline performances by tom hardy and charlize theron and the suberb score visual effects make up and sound mixing made this an masterpiece in this industry    its a 9 out of 10
Aug 1 2017,positive,super entertaining blockbuster that is action packed and full of visual scenes tom hardy and charlize theron are terrific and with the thrilling direction of george miller the film keeps you engaged throughout
Jul 31 2017,positive,one of the best action movies ive ever seen
Jul 30 2017,positive,edging out the force awakens for the best movie of 2015 fury road brings the franchise back to life with a vengeance tom hardy and charlize theron steal the show with oscarworthy performances and the action is some of the best ever put to film combine that with an intelligent script and a simple but effective story and you have one of the best action films of all time
Jul 30 2017,positive,the action in this movie is awesome tom hardy played his character well
Jul 28 2017,positive,one of the most visually stunning dynamic wellpaced  wellwritten movies ive ever seen its one that youll remember for years
Jul 28 2017,negative,how did this movie score such a high rating it was awful
Jul 26 2017,negative,it was a mad max movie without max that is once you get about a third through the beginning was a road warrioresque adrenaline shot with an enticing plot introduction that has you wondering just how and what max will do to stop immortan joe dead in his tracks then you meet the wives and especially furiosa soon after you forget that max is even involved because all he does is become a neardesignated driver and action prop all of a sudden furiosa is some maim character that we didnt ask for but would have appreciated if the roles of her and max were reversed the wives are dead weight another excuse just to make joe slightly angrier and more motivated to stop ma well furiosa when the rig would have been just fine to defend then theres this crash at the end thats a middle finger to the viewers
Jul 25 2017,positive,not really my scene but you cant fault the production values very loud but thrilling at times

Jul 20 2017,positive,an intense movie that leaves you clinging to the edge of your seat an absolute must watch film
Jul 20 2017,negative,bland emotionless and tiresome mad max fury road provides viewers with a 2hour long chase scene that may be as dry as the desert itself
Jul 18 2017,positive,a modern masterpiece of film making
Jul 16 2017,positive,certainly an immersive world and i get why it is highly regarded but it was not a film i enjoyed theres essentially no character developmentbackstoryexplication and the plot is relayed exclusively through elaborate drivingfight sequences which i space out on in essentially every action movie i watch i liked the feminist stuff and the fact that it was almost not at all about romantic love but this was not my movie
Jul 16 2017,positive,quite simply the best action film i have ever seen in my life
Jul 16 2017,positive,55 i dont really like to give 5 star reviews but this was one movie that i really felt deserved it i saw this in theaters and ive probably watched it 20 times since then and it gets better with each viewing everything from the action to the setting is fantastic definitely one of my favorite films
Jul 14 2017,negative,a complete and utter waste
Jul 12 2017,positive,this movie is beautiful throughout the entirety of its runtime
Jul 10 2017,positive,in world of action flicks that consistently fail to create their own style tone or even story george millers film towers above them all and shouts back down hey see this this is how you make an action movie
Jul 9 2017,positive,the most action i ever saw in a movie 90 of the stunts were real it adds to the tension
Jul 8 2017,negative,is everyone going berserk  the critics and audience members who rated this highly are clearly sniffing too much gasoline  raging adrenaline testosterone dystopian nonsense and pointless repetitive crazy a  chases to distract from lack of plot character or redeeming values  why are worthy actors like tom hardy and charlize theron in this  maybe they thought this would be more fun to perform than it is to watch  someone on bad drugs might get all hypedup over this crazy crapola  but if your brain is still functioning and you have any shred of decency left in you avoid this like the plague
Jul 7 2017,positive,exceptional stunt works and practical effects but this is probably the most overrated film of the past 10 years in my irrelevant opinion still worth a watch or two
Jul 5 2017,positive,an incredible thrill ride this movie starts hot and almost never lets up it tells a straightforward story gives you characters to care about and features some of the most intense action youll see anywhere a masterfully made film that works in every single way
Jul 4 2017,positive,an incredibly ferocious film george miller has achieved making an iconic masterpiece that is thrilling for everyone
Jul 4 2017,positive,heartwrenching character development and edge of seat action i am very pleasantly surprised
Jul 3 2017,positive,a beautiful mess of cinematic achievement
Jun 30 2017,negative,easily one of the most overrated movies ever mad max fury road looks cool but has a mediocre storyline mel gibsons original trilogy deserves a better reboot than this mess
Jun 28 2017,positive,saw it in theaters twice one of my favorite movies ever it deserves more praise than it gets because it is truly spectacular
Jun 26 2017,positive,actions and visual effects are great
Jun 26 2017,positive,i do not like this type of film  i dont think it really showcases tom hardys exceptional talent but he sure knows how to create characters  id watch anything he is in and like it
Jun 26 2017,positive,great effects and make up whilst tom hardy cannot replace mel gibson he does a pretty good job taking the baton and deserves praise for his excellent performance as the titular character mad max overall a great movie perfect for teenagers mainly hopefully there are more sequels to follow in this reboot gone right
Jun 25 2017,positive,postapocalyptic movies are awesome but i absolutely enjoyed this one eventually i will watch its predecessors because its an interesting world also i loved the music
Jun 23 2017,positive,it is extremely overrated and i dont know why
Jun 21 2017,positive,at the start of the movie max was chased by war boys there is a lot of fightingshooting in the scenes and it make me feel like a lot of action and killing scenes are going to be in the movie the start of the movie made me think about the things that can happen in the future  furiosa is the main character because she is the one who is going to fight immortan joe and she rescue the wives but max is also like a main character because without him furiosa wouldnt made it and beat immortan joe at the end i think the movie would be fine without the level of violence it has because there is too many killing scenes in the movie but i guess thats what makes the movie excellent all the violence that happened in the movie is because all of them want to rule the world  fury roads vision of the future can come true i think because if a war happens in the world and nuclear explode everywhere i think the only thing that will left is sand everywhere in the world because its going to kill all the nature and i think this is kind of realistic it doesnt really matter how realistic it is to me i think the film is trying to convey an environmental message by showing us what can happen in the future if war starts so it warns us  in mad max fury road most of the men are fighter or workers to serve their king and most of the women are used to help their king and do whatever he wants them to do and they use women to get babies because they need more people so their kingdom will become more powerful i think men are more leaders in the movie  i really enjoy the movie because all the shooting and killing scenes and the story line i think this movie is really great to watch
Jun 21 2017,positive,my first thoughts about the movie where that fury road was going to be an action packed film full of an epic car chase the movie was so fast that you felt that there was too much happening in one place at one time max and furiosa are a good combination they both are intelligent strong and work well as a team i think max is the main character in the film because the film is based around him  i think that the violence in the movie is a necessary thing otherwise the movie would be bland and it would not be any different to an ordinary film i think the violence fits in with the topic and that the characters played there parts well i think fury roads vision of the future is an accurate vision of what life could be like if we ran out of important materials  i do not think that feminism should be included in the film because it is an action film and is more about the fighting then telling a message that women should be treated equally to men fury road doesnt work as a feminist film because it is too fast paced and full of too much action for someone to focus on the feminism side of the movie i think the way miller included feminism is a good way to include it into the film because it is very easy to see the feminism  mad max fury road is a good film that i would suggest to someone who is willing to watch the film multiple times because there is too much to take in in one viewing i enjoyed mad max fury road and i think that the topic is suitable for modern day because it shows us a preview of what life could be like
Jun 20 2017,positive,george millers mad max fury road is a visually thrilling film for the audience to enjoy and view  the first thing to come up through my mind when i first saw the cover for the film i knew that it was going to be very actionpacked and the film would be set in a desert location    the obvious main character in the film is max since his name appears in the title and he does most of the fighting the intro scene of mad max fury road introduces the audience to max as he is seen with having a troubled past when he loses all his family and friends however furiosa can also be considered to be a main character as she has the role of commander of the war boys and helps max throughout his journey both characters max and furiosa arent one dimensional which is good because it improves the storyline and doesnt make the film boringuninteresting     violence in mad max fury road is required most of the time to fend off some of the war boys however in situations such as when max wanted to have water and his chains taken off him violence wasnt required he just wanted full control of the wives and furiosa     the film itself is trying to convey an environmental message but i doubt this is either believable or realistic to the audience as water is a renewable source and wouldnt be limited resource in the future mad max fury road is trying to convey a environmental message of how the future may become like the scenery of mad max fury road if we humans dont conserve resources like gasoline and oil    in most cases mad max fury road isnt feminist because the women are treated poorly and dont have the roles men do although furiosa is portrayed as a strong character with a lot of power and the film passes the bechel test meaning the film has more than two women and the women talk about topics other than men    overall mad max fury road is a great film with many thrilling action scenes and great fighting scenes but with minor tweaks here and there it could have been more realistic or believable to the audience viewing the film
Jun 20 2017,positive,mad max fury road review    as we started watching mad max fury road i had the vibe that this movie was going to be a boring action fiction movie and definitely not going to amuse me and be boring i do enjoy action movies but from looking at the setting and reading up what it was about i didnt see that i would enjoy it whatsoever and i wasnt enjoying it at the start the main character in mad max fury road is deal was made about the fact that the lead character of the film was a woman but according to george miller it had to be that way when what is being fought over is women it needed to be a woman who does the fighting overall furiosa had to be the main character in order to make the story make sense and work violence is needed in this film because the plot of fury road involves many fight and action scenes which leads to violence it isnt a problem in the movie because it structures the movie together and without violence i guess the movies wouldnt be that entertaining and wouldnt make sense as you can tell after watching the full movie it is 100 percent an unrealistic movie but that does not matter because miller has set fury road in a future desert wasteland where gasoline and water are scarce what i think millers message is in this movie is that he is telling us what he thinks the future may turn to as it may seem a little too unbelievable just remember that aliens are believed to be a myth but yet some in fact many still believe that they are real existing creatures so who knows maybe millers prediction of the future is correct and our country or even earth will turn into a desert wasteland as said before feminism does work in the film because furiosa the main character leads and takes risks which is showing the woman are worth the same as men and they are miller is sending a messages out to the world that the world should be equal and proves that women are strong and can do dangerous and risky things that men can do too overall i did enjoy the film and my opinion of the film changed dramatically from the beginning which is a good thing and means that you have to watch the whole film to enjoy it you cant just watch the trailer to come up with your opinion
Jun 20 2017,positive,while i was watching mad max i felt engaged and drawn into the action i wanted to keep watching the film more and more as it went on it made me think about the world and its devastation and who was responsible for the cause of the worlds corruption    max is supposedly the main character because his name is in the title and the storyline originally revolved around him and his fight for justice furiosa also plays a big part in the movie as maxs ally and max spends a lot of time trying to help himself and furiosa survive the minimum dialogue has no effect on their portrayal as their actions speak louder than words i can see depth in both of these characters as their past that has made them who they are    in the film violence is always used to solve problems and i dont think that these problems could be solved any other way the violence is a vital part of the movie and it is necessary as the characters are beyond verbal negotiation and have to resort to violence some of the violence is unrealistic such as the weapons that they use and how the vehicles are made     the setting is supposed to be the worlds future but i think we will be able to solve our problems with communication and negotiation so that we share the resources fairly i dont think it matters how realistic and extreme the vision of the future is because it is only for us to watch and enjoy the film could be saying that we need to make the unsustainable resources last as long as possible so the planet doesnt become corrupt     i think it is great how the film shows how women have as much strength as men furiosa and the breeders prove their strength by fighting off the war boys and immortan joe furiosa is technically the main character and she is using her strength and power to free the breeders and herself from immortan joes captivity    overall i enjoyed the film immensely as it was filled with action and engaging moments keeping me on the edge of my seat i would recommend watching the first 3 mad max films before this one to understand maxs journey
Jun 19 2017,positive,superb action and special effects
Jun 16 2017,positive,i had not been to the theater for a movie since the hobbit battle of the five armies almost five months ago  summer was here and i was ready for a movie at the theater  i originally anticipated id see avengers age of ultron first but it just wasnt appealing and i hadnt seen any of the other marvel movies in theater so why start now when i can just save my superhero binge for dc  because of that mad max fury road started looking more and more appealing  when the great reviews started coming in for it that all but settled it    this movie has to be the surprise of the summer  paced so quick and so fast with great imagery and sound theres not much to dislike about this movie  liked it so much i double dipped and i saw it twice which is something i rarely do  this movie may have reinvigorated my interest in action movies something that had been missing for awhile and parlayed into more interest for movies like terminator genisys    the year is still early with some movie called star wars the force awakens to come but this may win my voodoo award for movie of the year
Jun 14 2017,positive,the action movie of action movies put two acting gods hardy theron together and they skyrocket fury road into cinematic heaven     miller directs the sht out of this movie and it is great his touches are unmissable quick dirty anxious not to mention the story     action has never met an apocalyptic plot so fit for the genre somehow mad max marries a somewhat braindead movie drama into a thought provoking and meaningful story leaving moviegoers like me intrigued and actually emotionally interested in these characters and the resolution of the film     visually a grimy stylistic masterpiece i could feel the dry heat of that desert deserves all that oscar talk my only complaint was probably the endingi was left unfulfilled after an extremely satisfying action sequencewhat gives
Jun 14 2017,negative,well thats a couple hours if my life i wont get back      it starts off with violence and ends that way  the movie is one long car chase with lots of bloody crashes  plus theres a group of nubile scantily clad young women needing to be rescued  but that doesnt become apparantly for a while  the plot is vague the characters undeveloped  i would have been interested in who the group of women are and what happenedto their land     this was flat out awful  dont waste your time
Jun 14 2017,positive,on the surface mad max fury road is a violent thrilling and beautiful action masterpiece that is enjoyable and entertaining to witness but beneath that surface george miller places striking and true social commentaries on the behaviors hidden deep within society today there was not one slow or dull part of this movie and i had a hell of a time experiencing it for myself an instant action classic
Jun 13 2017,positive,great addition to the franchise
Jun 13 2017,positive,the action movie of action movies put two acting gods hardy theron together and they skyrocket fury road into cinematic heaven   miller directs the sht out of this movie and it is great  his touches are unmissable quick dirty anxious not to mention the story   action has never met an apocalyptic plot so fit for the genre somehow mad max marries a somewhat braindead movie drama into a thought provoking and meaningful story leaving moviegoers like me intrigued and actually emotionally interested in these characters and the resolution of the film   visually a grimy stylistic masterpiece i could feel the dry heat of that desert deserves all that oscar talk my only complaint was probably the endingi was left unfulfilled after an extremely satisfying action sequencewhat gives
Jun 13 2017,positive,long was the wait actually i stopped waiting and simply gave up on it but george miller in the end was given the chance to make a new mad max movie and this is it i dont know the last time i was so swept away by a movie this visceral the passion into making this by all involved bursts from every frame and we can only marvel at its existence and be thankful charlize theron is granted a life time pass in my book because of this movie and of course she is the real lead max is a bit of a cyphre and not really present that much to the viewer nux knocks it out of the park though but none of it would have come accross the way it so overwhelmingly did without george miller at the helm  im very grateful for this movie and will revisit many many times
Jun 12 2017,positive,george millers mad max fury road is a visually thrilling film for the audience to enjoy and view the storyline is just amazing to be able to see the main protagonist furiosa take us through her journey to the green land and then she and other main characters such as max was found to be making a drastic attempt to have control over the citadel the locations where mad max fury road is filmed couldnt be any better as the location is best placed for a film with having to get vital needs such as a quiet desert mad max fury road is very profitable as it had a hefty budget of 200 million dollars during the production of the film with their worldwide box gaining over 300 million dollars
Jun 10 2017,positive,visually outstanding this is what an action movie should be mixing practical and cg effects in perfect amounts it has a solid story and makes me long for more
Jun 10 2017,positive,great movie loved the characters reminds me a lot of borderlands 2 video game villains
Jun 6 2017,positive,wow just wow this movie is awesome so entertaining
Jun 6 2017,neutral,absolutely insane reviews its a popcorn flick with little storyline thats been told much better in other wasteland future flicks including some of the oldest anime in existence like fist of the north star you have to lower your expectations to such abysmal levels and forgive it more than several dozen times for its inconsistancies and lack of realistic human death in such a dystopian future what makes it all the worse is the over praise of it its a fine waste of 2 hours but dont expect humor realism depth or even good action bmovie with a high budget and no depth  if thats as low as your expectations are then you may enjoy it i know how mine have dwindled to nothing out of hollywood and i still think this was just barely above shutting off
Jun 4 2017,positive,pure movie what a fantastic ride watching this movie again and againwithout even knowing the background story or other episodes of it
Jun 4 2017,positive,thoroughly enjoyed this film it is an action ride from start to finish and its high tempo rarely lets up great cast visuals stunts story in a believable distopian world i hadnt seen the originals but would recommend this for anyone who likes a high tempo film with a fair share of explosions and good acting
Jun 3 2017,positive,one of the best scifiaction films of the last 10  years
Jun 3 2017,positive,quite probably one of my favorite movies of all time a perfect blend of hectic action and superb visuals that serve as a testament to the  success of the show dont tell direction of the story an ideal virtuous circle between style and substance masterpiece
Jun 1 2017,positive,this is a really well made movie but its also pretty intense graphic and gritty i may rewatch it again at some point though
Jun 1 2017,negative,overrated i dont understand the high score the critics gave the movie critics like to pick and choose what movies doing g the same thjngs i would compare this to transformers 4 as i stopped paying attention after 30 minutes of over the top action
Jun 1 2017,positive,best mad max film yes how it that possible i dont know
May 30 2017,positive,50 out of 6  when the vary thing we see that gets us moving is the last thing that puts us in a place to start living when the vary thing that gets us living we can let them be the last thing that ends all and any place for all mankind  when we dont see what the world would turn out until you live in it to know it is what it is and we have to survive it long past what we see and know to blame or put a stop to it when what we see is a mad world where all that is left our natural resources controlled by warlords when what we see we cant escape from when its all around us and only place we can go or return to is where life can live with the natural resources when what we see we cant escape when our livlihood is taken from us and all we live with is madness for revenge and freedom when we see we are all trapped in this madness rely on every resource to get through our livlihoods to see we eventually end up fighting for whats remaining when we dont know why all what is gone is gone to only see what we can grasp when we see we must travel far count on unlikely people to steer us there find refuge in what so little remains course through the warring environments family quarrels business and political disputes to live freely how we intended civilly when civility is gone but not forgotten when we see another place of refuge when we see all is left in this ungodless world is ours for the taking and conqueroringããâ  when war is the answer when all we see is lifes one last chance at survival when the soul and all what gives life purpose and energy speaks to us shows us a destiny we yet dont see once we course our path in the right direction and face head on the future for life to live again when we sure dont know what death sees but it sure sends us on the right path when the life is on the unbalance and death rules the underworld when not all of lifes inventions can see to our future salvation but our thirst to continue when we see we owe a great debt to those who saved us whom can pave a new road with a new perspective and leadership when we are seen clearly a dominant species when we can travel far and unearth the vary evoluntionary traits that got us this far for some we reached a peak that we yet dont understand why we cant go any further and for others we understand they yet have reached their climax
May 30 2017,negative,story is were but the effect are good
May 26 2017,positive,im not a huge mad max fan as i have always felt that it exploited aussie revhead culture cliches for the sake of a wider audience i am also not big on the kind of franchise reboots that the marvel factory have been churning out for the last decade this reboot is not subtle its full of fuel fire blood metal spit and dirt but hey isnt that mad max and what a turbo reboot it is the stunts the editing the effects are quite exasperating to say the least when it does let us catch a breath we are given moments of recollection and storytelling under the expanse of a starry outback sky which are a thing of true cinematic beauty max is still a laconic tortured individual who this time plays second fiddle to charlize therons equally stoic heroine but we are given some back story here and there to make up for this this is not just a reboot for the franchise but its an intravenous fuel injection for the australian film industry
May 22 2017,positive,highly recommend my favorite movie of all time
May 13 2017,negative,dull could not finish loved the first movie mad max
May 13 2017,positive,a visceral postapocalyptic australian action all about survival unusual action series in that every installment is highly rated
May 12 2017,positive,one of the best reboots out there riveting visually original and loaded with action
May 11 2017,positive,if the dark knight and inception didnt exist mad max fury road would be the greatest action film ever made ive never seen a film that made my blood pump with excitement before this one the fact that most of the stunts were real makes my jaw drop and the genius color palette is just beautiful to look at oh what a movie what a lovely movie    1010
May 10 2017,positive,mad max fury road is a sequel  reboot of the 1980s film franchise directed by original director george miller the film stars tom hardy max rockatansky charlize theron furiosa and nicholas hoult nux it has good acting from all of the actors involved however tom hardy character does not have too much character development when compared to the rest of the cast there are amazing balls to the wall action set pieces that are very well choreographed and beautiful to look at this film is excellent but it has a very simple plot
May 6 2017,positive,this doesnt pretend to be anything other than an action film and thats why it works
May 4 2017,positive,fantastic fx is what makes this movie groundbreaking in a digitalized film industry it should be a reminder to filmmakers that cgi should be used as a garnish not the entire entrée intelligent director george miller gave a purpose to every insane shtick in the story that people often like to regard as meaningless nonsense some of the voices in the audience say too much action but i say that too much action in a mad max film is like complaining that youre getting more steak than you thought you were paying for there is a plot and there are relatable characters who develop max rockatansky is a man who has had a terrible life and has a guilt complex  i can name a lot of people like that furiosa is a redemptionseeking woman who seeks home granted the one complaint that is understandable is that the story has too much furiosa and not enough max in my opinion max was important enough to the story and had enough screen time to count as a main character alongside furiosa   its of no surprise that the sound mixing and filmsound editing won academy awards the music provided by junkie xl also kept the adrenaline pumping from behind the movie very well  lastly id like to note that hugh keaysbyrne made another excellent performance as a villain
May 1 2017,positive,mad max fury road is possibly one of the best action movies to come out of the 21st century and already one of my favorite action movies of all time george miller put the fury in fury road with this nonstop action edge of your seat neverending thrill ride it is one of the most wicked and exciting experiences you could ever have in cinema for the movie is visually breathtaking boasts incredible performances and never loses you for a moment there is no slow buildup drag or slow sequences the second the movie starts it gets right to what you want to see and keeps you there throughout the whole thing with ingenious direction eyepopping practical and visual effects and mindblowing sequences of high octane carnage mad max truly is one of the gems
May 1 2017,positive,good update of the original enjoyed it
May 1 2017,positive,tom hardy is great as max and the car chases are awesome if you wanna watch some mad max films then watch mad max 2 the road warrior 1981 and this one
Apr 30 2017,positive,its a pretty decent film but fell way short of all the hype  theres nothing to it no character development no plot little acting  its just action and cool cars
Apr 23 2017,positive,one of those movies that leaves you so amazed at what you just saw that you can barely speak so intense so fastpaced so well choreographed and looking so good that it cannot disappoint after watching this i rewatched road warrior and that movie seems like a bmovie in comparison it hurts me to say that but its true
Apr 23 2017,neutral,this movie bored me to tears the acting was horrid the action was all over the place and made no sense the story wait was there even a storyline horrible movie
Apr 22 2017,positive,an absolute visual and audio explosion that is wild ride from start to finish went in without having previously seen the any mad max films but enjoyed this turn up your surround sound for it
Apr 17 2017,negative,legitimately the worst movie ive ever seen in my entire life the director put in a very transparent effort to make the movie modern for example the metallicalike rock star following them into battle half of the movie was completely laughable very much an unintentional comedy some of the details like the silver spray paint they spray into their mouths before a mission just completely dont make any sense the entire movie was just one big pointless chase without any context so incredibly stupid
Apr 17 2017,negative,action packed but not epic tom hardys preformance was very average lost interest in the film within half an hour definitely dont recommend it
Apr 16 2017,positive,awesome gritty spectacular wonderfully acted and a fantastic engaging story definitely one of the best action films ever made
Apr 12 2017,neutral,beautiful film making on display but no substance    i had heard all manner of glorious things going into this film george millers continuation of the infinitely praised mad max trilogy lets forget the third one     it is immediately apparent while watching this movie that george miller and many other people behind this film are very talented the standard of craft here is mind blowing maintaining an expert blend of practicality and cgi to the extent in which it is often very hard to tell which is which additionally the editing is by far some of the best ive ever seen entirely fluid but radical hops between shots     however i simply couldnt get invested in the action as i simply did not give the slightest inch of a shit as to what would become of the characters no matter how phenomenal the destruction no matter how absurdly drool worthy the wide shot there was nothing pulling me to it because i could not relate to anyone in the film and there was very little time and effort establishing the characters that inhabit this film     i also noticed that some of the dialogue is truly ridiculous i am aware it is meant to be mental however if the glossy radical filter was stripped away from this film many instances of character communication would just be comparable to idiots in a script run through screaming at each other something that i just couldnt find myself enjoying     believe me i would have loved to give this film a  higher rating than a mere half mark but since the script seemed to be incredibly boring it significantly reduced the impact of the clearly incredible stunts on display as a result i do not think this film is worthy of a higher star grade if this was entirely based on the craft and direction 5 stars would not be a problem at all for me however filmmaking is about what you say as well as how you say it
Apr 6 2017,positive,very well made but it lacked substance
Mar 31 2017,positive,strong female lead stunning visualsits like star wars with cars
Mar 28 2017,positive,while much of this thrilling ride is actionpacked special effects the comprehensive creativity and commitment they put into designing the world and the ability with which they were able to bolster characterrelationship development with such few scenes made it an enjoyable film for someone who is doesnt quite affiliate as a pure action junkie
Mar 26 2017,positive,nonstop action thats all  i aint complaining
Mar 26 2017,positive,action packed adrenaline ride  mad max fury road gives you no break on the well coreographed action
Mar 24 2017,positive,this movie has action out the ass like theres no tomorrow 90 action 10 dialogue not really what makes movies that great but the film was entertaining to watch and therons character was one fierce muthaefer great movie but onetimewatch sort of ordeals
Mar 23 2017,positive,wow in uhd and dolby atmos this one is incredible
Mar 21 2017,positive,i never expected a movie of this nature to be so emotional and engaging
Mar 20 2017,positive,simply great especially in terms of visuals and masking
Mar 19 2017,negative,why did they call this mad max the supposed antihero plays a bit roll in the movie the female lead is just a little too butch to be believed i am sorry to say between this and mad max 3 it is hard to decide which is worse stick with the first two mad max movies
Mar 18 2017,negative,i just dont see anything special about this overly odd violent and over the top action flick that did nothing to excite me and at times made me laugh unintentionally
Mar 15 2017,positive,one of the few action films deserving of a 5 star rating
Mar 15 2017,positive,thrilling ride from start to finish amazing journey with a good story curve out of one giant chase scene
Mar 14 2017,positive,the effects were pretty top notch but there was almost no coherent story and anywhere were story started to be told was just interrupted by more action also the sound equalizing was way off in some of the dialogue scenes and in a movie where there isnt much dialogue its kind of annoying action a story  c
Mar 11 2017,positive,i just want furiosa to be my fiance iloveher
Mar 10 2017,positive,super intense to the point that i felt exhausted watching it but visually unforgettable
Mar 10 2017,positive,my kinf of action films  loved every minute of it 
Mar 10 2017,negative,2 hours of relentless action and little development of storyline left me exhuasted
Mar 9 2017,positive,the action speaks for itself
Mar 5 2017,positive,great moviea thrill ride the whole way great acting and stuntsspecial effects were awesome
Mar 5 2017,positive,high intensity low in dialog adrenaline fueled masterpiece perfectly paced with memorable characters and settings stands on its own merits without the need of seeing the originals although i do recommend seeing the originals a must see
Mar 1 2017,negative,max says like 4 words movie has nothing to do with mad max and there is the stupidest chase scene involving a guy playing a guitar totally stupid movie not titled mad max and minus guitar player scene it wouldnt have been that bad
Mar 1 2017,positive,how ive only just seen this is beyond me   should be a crime really
Feb 27 2017,positive,great addition to the franchise but tom hardy almost seemed like a side character
Feb 26 2017,neutral,it all looked too bloody poished for my liking wanted to kill the guitarist
Feb 25 2017,positive,mad max fury road is really good its so much fun and whatever that stuff
Feb 25 2017,positive,loved every minute of it 
Feb 24 2017,positive,well shot and highly entertaining
Feb 24 2017,positive,when people imagine the classic films of the previous genration the answers are usually films like the empire strikes back and terminator 2 usually come to mind when people ask what the classics of this generation were mad max fury road will most certainly be one of them this movie hits all of the notes that make a great action film in the 80s and makes it in present day it has awesome characters a fantastic musical score and some of the practical best action probably of all time this movie is a modern day masterpiece and when people look back on the great movies of this decade we will not look at spotlight which won best picture the same year this was nominated as the biggest highlight we will look back on mad max
Feb 22 2017,positive,george miller the wonderful australian director struck gold with his comeback movie mad max fury road  the marvelous choice of actors with tom hardy and charlize theron and the wonderful camerawork that seemed to cover every necessary angle for every battle help explain how this movie left me on the edge on my seat     mad max gets things rolling by having max crawl out from under his badass vehicle  the entire movie you get to see these amazing sand vehicles coming at you from every direction trying to capture max  when he escapes with ease from his first set of enemies you start to realize that hes never going to be alone with a sense of safety literally i dont think that there was ever a scene without an intense highspeed chase  george miller does a wonderful job of never letting you take your eyes off the movie      i think the production is what makes this movie fantastic  the camerawork the terrain and the backgrounds all provide nice jawdropping scenes that give this movie life  i caught myself many times taking a step back and saying damn thats a nice shot there  the first three max movies were all filmed in melbourne australia and mad max fury road was moved to the southern african country of namibia  the lengthy scenes were filled with roaring trucks flying through the desert so you never wanted to look away  shots are always filled with chaos and many antagonists that are just waiting to make their move  george miller keeps the images and backgrounds coming at you like a meteor shower  one second youre looking at a huge sandstorm and the next youre looking at a battle filled with over 50 vehicles  the stunk work and tracking shots are unreal as it shows people flying off their vehicles left and right the whole movie     max goes through the movie having constant flashbacks that hurt his ability to focus these flashbacks consist of rapid unsteady closeups of his lost daughter   this aids to create a story that will also keep the nonaction lovers craving more  mad max however has its fair share of funky unnecessary scenes but the film doesnt seem to suffer from it at the slightest  does every movie make sense the whole time no so just go with it and strap back in your seat and continue to watch the actionpacked film     before watching this movie i didnt know what to expect and even after watching it i still couldnt tell you what was going on but i weirdly was fond of that and how george miller left me feeling a different type of way  this movie has its own personality and i think it might be years until a similar action film comes out  this movie won an oscar was nominated for numerous other ones and after watching it you can easily see why  mad max will leave you craving more so get ready for a new standard of action movies because you wont know what hit you if you think that a scene is breathtaking in mad max just wait about 5 minutes until the next one and i bet youll be saying the same words
Feb 22 2017,neutral,this is the most insane film ive ever seen but there is no real plot and is basically just a 2 hour chase film i didnt really enjoy it
Feb 21 2017,positive,great special effects however the plot is not as amazing as critics have made it seem
Feb 20 2017,positive,george miller has something to brag about reviving a decadesold dystopian fantasy focused not only on automobile warfare but also a thrilling reminder at what humanity is capable of when they abuse their own power and resources for greedy means mad max also proves itself to be a modern spectacle filled with eyepopping and exhilarating action
Feb 19 2017,positive,over the opening credits of mad max fury road our title character says in gravelly narration my world is fire and blood and he could not be more right set in the same postapocalyptic wasteland as the road warrior and mad max beyond thunderdome where oil gasoline and water are scarce but not as scarce as civilization this adventure finds max tom hardybrooding and often silent as almost a side character to the main narrative the action really kicks off when imperator furiosa charlize theron smuggles a group of women away from their captor in her massive war rig and is pursued by countless bad guys in supedup weaponized vehiclesand max is forcibly brought along for the chase that is about all the plot there is in the screenplay written by director george miller with brendan mccarthy and nico lathouris but with a film as wellexecuted in direction cinematography performances visual effects and costume and production design as this one that is enough     the villain of fury road immortan joe played by hugh keaysbyrne who was also a villain in 1979s mad max is a cross between darth vader and skeletor in appearance he rules the citadel with equal parts cruelty and tyranny giving the people of the citadel little water to live on and keeping women in a vault as his wives or put more bluntly breeders when he discovers furiosas betrayal he sets out with a massive war party including most memorably a barge stacked with amplifiers and speakers and a man whose sole purpose is to play heavy metal riffs on a flamethrowing guitar immortan joes minions are shirtless chalkpainted men called war boys desperate to impress their leader and die gloriously on the fury road     max being a road warrior searching for a righteous cause after all eventually decides albeit reluctantly to help furiosa but not until after they have an intense fight in the desert with the war party quickly closing in and max chained to both a car door and a war boy called nux nicholas hoult however despite fury road being nominally maxs adventure it is furiosas mission which drives the story she is our main character and theronwho can perhaps be best described as super badassis the real star and standout in this movie her performance is quiet but perfectly measured and our emotionsyes there are emotions in fury roadare invested with her     it might seem odd to call the gritty violent highoctane fury road a feminist action movie but that argument is not a difficult one to make max does his fair share of driving and killing but he does not swing in to rescue these womenthey are equally his saviors the group of young women led by furiosa are not damsels in distress and this movie makes each of them feel like a full person and treats them accordingly though they are not all experienced road warriors like furiosa the women display other strengths like bravery and compassion when one of the escapees capable riley keough finds nux in the back of their war rig curled up in shame and humiliation at having failed immortan joe she convinces him through gentle conversation to become an ally in their escape fury road is a movie about women rescuing other women from male cruelty     though fury road is essentially one big unrelenting chase miller finds ways to give the audience moments of respite and a chance to breathe one of my favorite scenes in the movie happens when our protagonists flight comes to a halt the engines of the war rig have overheated and must cool down before they can continue but immortan joes forces are only getting closer max gathers his weapons and begins to walk toward the pursuing villains furiosa asks what if youre not back by the time the engines are cool max quietly replies well you keep moving and sets out into the blue tinged night a battle ensueswe hear gunshots but rather than jumping into the middle of the fight we stay with furiosa and watch from a distance    when watching fury road you get the impression that george miller was mostly left alone with little to no studio interference or notes from the marketing department there are many unpleasant grotesque images in this movie but there are also many fascinating and exciting ones too the costume design production design makeup and hairstyling and visual effects are all deservedly nominated for oscars watching fury road again i noticed more and more intricate and impressive details the score by junkie xl was not nominated for an oscar but it is a great nonetheless and used to perfection fury road feels like it was a true collaboration between all of the people involved with the production both on and off camera     this fourth installment in the mad max series comes 30 years after the third mad max beyond thunderdome and for fans of the earlier films fury road does not disappoint however you dont need to have seen any of the other mad max films to enjoy this one since each film has its own standalone story which is explained and changed slightly at the opening of each movie i was immensely entertained when i saw this film in theaters and again when i saw it on dvd everything i had enjoyed about the film the first time still had the same effect on me and my excitement for the film has not waned this is an epic film of tremendous quality which is usually not the case with big budget summer action movies or sequels fury road is a full bore action movie executed with noticeable care and meticulous thought at every turn
Feb 16 2017,positive,excellent follow up to the original films
Feb 15 2017,positive,with lots of thrills and top notch action sequences mad max fury road never fails to disappoint
Feb 12 2017,positive,george millers force awakens
Feb 12 2017,positive,mad max fury road is a pulsepounding nonstop thrill ride that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat from beginning to end without forgetting to get us invested in the characters while the plot is simple the set pieces are lovely to look at and the action is exhilarating the performances  especially charlize theron and tom hardy  are pretty solid too it holds your attention throughout even if you havent seen the originals and should leave action fans immensely satisfied overall while it is somewhat light on plot mad max fury road compensates with a fastpaced plot memorable characters and terrific action oh what a movie what a lovely movie
Feb 12 2017,positive,one of the best action films ever
Feb 8 2017,positive,beautifully looking and exhilarating just a thrill to watch as george miller and tom hardy bring this series back to life with this modern classic
Feb 7 2017,positive,fabulous cinematography can only take a film so far while this was great to look at the story wasnt very complex but it was enjoyable
Feb 5 2017,positive, im not a huge mad max fan as i have always felt that it exploited aussie revhead culture cliches for the sake of a wider audience i am also not big on the kind of franchise reboots that the marvel factory have been churning out for the last decade the dark knight returns was about as much fun as sitting at a construction site for two hours this reboot is not subtle its full of fuel fire blood metal spit and dirt but hey isnt that mad max and what a turbo reboot it is the stunts the editing the effects are quite exasperating to say the least when it does let us catch a breath we are given moments of recollection and storytelling under the expanse of a starry outback sky which are a thing of true cinematic beauty max is still a laconic tortured individual who this time plays second fiddle to charlize therons equally stoic heroine but we are given some back story here and there to make up for this this is not just a reboot for the franchise but its an intravenous fuel injection for the australian film industry
Feb 4 2017,positive,this is one of my favourite movies of all time
Feb 4 2017,positive,one of the best movies ever made
Feb 2 2017,negative,what nonsensical drivel boring and silly
Feb 2 2017,negative,i dont get it i am a huge mad max fan from way back i had high hopes for this movie and it is just plain awful the acting is wooden and script is weak the premise is lacking major disappointment i think its popularity is due to people just wanting to jump on the band wagon and feel part of the group think  so sad
Jan 28 2017,positive,its been a long time since i saw the first movie of mad max that featured mel gibson in this one we have tom hardy to play as lone wanderer with a traumatic past    the cinematography is absolutely amazing love how they blend in the contrast in every scene and the characters were colorful within im just glad there were no shaky cameras in this movie vehicle scenes were really really good i think its hard to pull off such scenes because the actors have to interact perfectly to set things in motion and preventing to get a lot of takes i was aware that the movie was in development hell but im glad it finally came out and its a really good movie    surprisingly its a continuation of the overall story of mad max i havent watched the rest except first one and like i said before its been a real long time but i do remember how hardcore mad max is and he is a force to be reckoned with something about lone wanderers and their calm before the storm attitude that makes them stand out from the others    charlize theron oh what a gal love her performance as always a pretty good actress in a pretty good movie i cant describe well anymore than i already can but to say that she adds the spice into the whole story of the fury road made her character tough as nails and would do anything to bring the oppressed girls to safe haven one thing i didnt like much but its probably just me is there was not enough mad max but i guess its not bad to give other characters the spotlight and while we know mad max is just coming along for the ride surviving day by day of course while that was just my gripe overall the movie is great nevertheless    mad max fury road is another one rollercoaster ride you dont want to miss you dont have to watch the previous films to get more of the overall story but if you like then do so mad max is legit
Jan 25 2017,positive,george miller does it again what a visual masterpiece with very little cgi and real action stunts
Jan 24 2017,positive,holy shit this movie is fucking awesome best movie of 2015 although the movie has almost no plot to speak of the action makes up for it the cgi and practical blend in magically and at some points i have trouble telling the difference this movie was everything i wanted and more if you havent seen this movie yet go see it for fucks sake best action movie i have seen in a long time
Jan 22 2017,positive,a very pleasant surprise better than the original ones great movie
Jan 22 2017,negative,just another silly overblown action flick
Jan 20 2017,positive,an amazing perfectly executed journey into millers dystopia  a must see for fans of action flicks
Jan 19 2017,negative,how can u rate this movie so high
Jan 17 2017,positive,the simple plot one long chase scene is elevated by everything else in the film  the acting is good the action is intense  i like that it doesnt follow many action film cliches  spoiler alert   max and furiosa do not end up in a romantic relationship  i am so happy they didnt make them love interest  although there is a romantic relationship between side characters its exactly that a side story and it isnt done over the top    criticism for this movie having over the top cgi and being feminist is laughable  its just a great action film  it passed the wife test
Jan 16 2017,negative,this movie was awful it was extremely predictable the acting was stiff and poor the over the top effects were too much and were there to distract from the crappy acting and paper thin plot line how this movie was even nominated for anything other than a razzy is beyond me
Jan 15 2017,positive,obviously the road warrior is the best mad max but this is right up with it action packed and thrilling one of the best films i have ever seen
Jan 14 2017,positive,it is the quintessential action film of this generation
Jan 14 2017,neutral,jays review of mad max fury road      i havent seen a lot of the mad max films and thats probably why im going to  be so negative on this one   so lets start with the story max helps a girl save the abused wives of a religious dictator who leads a clan and controls most of the water tom hardy does a pretty good job as mad max but he barely has any dialogue and it kind of annoys me because it sound like a lot happened in between the films and i wouldve love to see him talk about but not to much furiosa is an interesting character but her rebelling all of a sudden is kinda of a weird introduction to the character all  the other actors do a great job in this film  now the action funny a lot people say this is some of the best action in cinema but it barely goes farther than mission impossible and 007 what i mean is that its pretty underwhelming and it does that instead of talking about scenes that are never brought up or explored    it has some ok action and its well acted but it kind of gets boring as it goes on
Jan 13 2017,positive,just to say  phew 
Jan 12 2017,neutral,at one point in george millers totally whacked out new film a character proclaims oh what a day  what a lovely day  if you end up watching this film as i did chances are your day will be anything but that  mad max fury road is a totally underwhelming experience a film that promised so much but ended up flattering to deceive  george who also created the mad max trilogy of the 80s with mel gibson in the titular role goes for the jugular this time delivering a film thats high on adrenalin but short on nuance  plot you ask immortan joe is a dictator who presides over his subjects with an iron hand  water guzzoline and common sense are in short supply  it falls upon a rebel imperator furiosa and max himself to liberate the country from the clutches of joes oppression  in fact furiosa charlize theron in a stellar turn is the heart and soul of this enterprise she completely owns the screen each time she appears on it lending a sense of urgency and gracefulness to the films proceedings  tom hardy on the other hand is completely out of sorts he lacks the charisma and easy charm that a leading role of this nature would inevitably demand  the whole film is basically one long explosionfilled chase down a barren dystopian landscape that could give panem from hunger games a run for its money  problem is the aforementioned chase takes all of two exruciating mindnumbing hours  millers vision is grand and has a sweeping quality to it the same cannot be said for his execution  a good film goes far beyond just expensive cgi and vfx it requires a solid script cracking dialogue and characters whom you can empathise with and relate to  in his zest for making a film that redefines the action genre miller unfortunately seems to have overlooked this elementary fact  i could have slept through the entirety of this films duration and it would hardly have made a difference  in the films very beginning max says my name is max my world is fire and blood  and boring he might have added this road is full of potholes
Jan 9 2017,positive,this movie is sooo good i had super high expectations and they were exceeded this is a superb action flick brought many new fans to the franchise and will always be one of my favorite movies best action movie ever made its better and better each time you watch it it made me cry of happiness
Jan 9 2017,positive,this movie is the most awesome movie to come out this decade
Jan 6 2017,neutral,creativenot my favorite but fun to watch
Jan 6 2017,positive,dont watch this movie or you will be in a desprerate need of a sequel
Jan 6 2017,positive,george miller showed us a definition of what an action movie is and what a practical work is from this film not only the film was a feast to the eyes but also a feast to the ears an action film that will be remembered for a long time
Jan 5 2017,positive,whoa what a ride that was the most adrenaline pumping film experience ive had in a long time the whole story can be described in one sentence but the action is so beautifully made that it feels almost like one long choreographed dance ups the ante for all subsequent movies that wants to include any kind of chase scene involving vehicles this i will most definitely see again and i am almost tempted to actually see the earlier films in this franchise
Jan 4 2017,negative,absolute garbage there is absolute zero value to a movie that has nothing more to it than driving around and explosions
Jan 3 2017,positive,the most overrated movie of 2015
Jan 3 2017,positive,best action film ever made
Jan 3 2017,negative,wow i dont get all the hype  really didnt like this movie
Jan 3 2017,positive,excellent job of bringing back an old iconic movie back
Jan 2 2017,positive,once of the best action movies ive seen the directing in this film is so amazing and george miller should have won an academy award for it although the brutal and aggressive action overshadows everything there is actually well meaningful themes in this film beyond all the wildness and monstrosity seriously this is what action movies are all about the exhilaration the visuals its feels too perfect tom hardy and charlie theron both deliver top notch performances this is every action movie lovers dream
Jan 2 2017,positive,nonstop madness miller takes you on a road trip through hell and you will like it
Jan 1 2017,positive,the greatest action movie ever made
Jan 1 2017,positive,arguably the best movie of 2015 to mesome others surprisingly like the force awakens more this movie is on par with the classic that is mad max 2road warrior this movie looks spectaculari believe it took 25 or 15 years to makecasting choices like tom hardy was a excellent pick the action is non stopin a good way like the bourne ultimatum and the dialogue is rough i have no flaws on this moviefind this on dvd now
Jan 1 2017,negative,mad max is mostly a long dull chase im shocked that most of the top critics found this any good sure the special effects are overwhelming but it lacked in the plot acting dialogue and originality
Dec 29 2016,positive,a study in minimalism simple and fantastic
Dec 28 2016,positive,daring kinetic and mad this film is technically glorious and it rattles on at a killer pace inventive and smart which for a road based action movie is utterly refreshing
Dec 28 2016,positive,pure action in the good way and by the way its directed by the same guy as the other films so thats a plus
Dec 26 2016,negative,i get it mad max is supposed to be a crazy insane post apocalyptic movie but i still dont see how its frenetic editing over the top stunt work freaky philosophical premise warranted six oscars
Dec 17 2016,neutral,garbage that lacks the originality of the original the only thing that makes it halfway decent is how pretty the explosions are the plot is has serious gaps in it and the heroes dont differentiate themselves from the side characters if you liked the original you might enjoy this film but i will guarantee that you wont watch it more than once
Dec 17 2016,negative,i didnt like this movie there was hardly any talking and the characters were just exaggerated toughguys didnt matter whether they were male a female i couldnt wait for it to end unfortunately i had to wait  a long time for it to end
Dec 13 2016,negative,such an overrated movie the action becomes tiresome and boring after half an hour theres little to no plot and i did not make one emotional connection to any of the characters it was a snoozefest
Dec 11 2016,positive,genius pure genius           great action great movie
Dec 10 2016,positive,i recommend watching how they made this film first it will make you appreciate this work of art so much more when you watch it
Dec 10 2016,positive,maybe its just me but other than the inredible stunts and visual effects i didnt find much value in this film
Dec 6 2016,positive,furiosa is the star
Dec 4 2016,positive,well choreographed and enjoyable captured the aesthetic that the mad max universe has been in pursuit of the writing and editing left something to be desired at times and tom hardys performance seemed lacking all in all worth seeing but had more potential
Nov 30 2016,positive,best imagery on the big screen in years splendid dystopia
Nov 26 2016,positive,a rare case of excessive action minimal story and shallow characters that really works a unique movie experience
Nov 25 2016,positive,pretty wicked action movie george miller does it again after so many years on from the original theron and hardy were great together
Nov 24 2016,negative,beautiful movie but just not very interesting it was boring and didnt bring anything new to the genre filming location was beautiful though
Nov 24 2016,negative,worthless movie not a worthy sequal
Nov 22 2016,positive,im going to be honest i thought this movie was going to be absolutely crap i thought it was going to fall short considering how much of a masterpiece the original is i was truly so surprised for a movie that was just racing and jumping this movie was absolutely amazing and i think i may have liked it better than the original which is one of my favorite movies of all time
Nov 21 2016,positive,best movie of the year
Nov 21 2016,positive,this this is an action movie i hate action movies because the stories are often vapid the story in mad max fury road is meaningful its powerful and its matched only by the stunning cinematography this movie is gorgeously shot and perfectly edited every action scene is natural it isnt forced even if there are some very choreographed scenes it works and considering the movement of the vehicles as these shots take place it feels real im sure there are some effects used but the scale is epic and reminds me of the intensity of the chariot races in benhur simply said this movie is brilliant
Nov 20 2016,positive,great cinematography fast cut editing nonstop action an amazing score intense sequences and an outstanding performance of a badass female character it definitely is a mad world what else can i ask
Nov 20 2016,negative,this is far and away the most overrated movie made in the last 20 years i dare anyone to go back and watch the original mad max then watch this steaming heap of garbage and tell me again that this is the second best science fiction movie of all time you children have lost your minds
Nov 12 2016,negative,i understand why this movie has the hype that it does but i really dont like it its so boring it really is just a feature length chase scene and its boring
Nov 12 2016,positive,mad max fury road is probably one of the best action films since the raid dont forget i said one theres still john wick fury road may be light on story but when it comes to action sequences and the lack of cgi and green or blue screen its a masterpiece fury road is filled with practical effects along with amazing stuntwork      owens grade a
Nov 12 2016,positive,there is hope in this postapocalyptic world
Nov 7 2016,positive,best action film of all time and the black and white directors release is brilliant and gives the film a completely different feel
Nov 5 2016,negative,tom hardy sucks the joy out of this movie
Nov 4 2016,positive,ive seen this movie so many fucking times
Nov 3 2016,neutral,im not going to lie i was only half watching this there was just so much going on honestly i already knew i wouldnt invest too much into this movie because i lowkey hate playing chaotic video games like this i am more of a ratchet and clank organized chaos kind of gal that being said this films chaos was nothing short of brilliant it brought you into this zaney world and kept you there the entire time ultimately i understand the films positive raining but it was not my cup of tea
Nov 3 2016,positive,i wont talk about the visuals of the movie although dazzling and much written about no visuals could possibly eclipse the powerful ideas it has to offer and this is exactly the part that many critics seem to neglect for some bizarre reason    on the one hand we have the world of men infused with phony ideology drunk on fake glory and built for the sole purpose of feeding into power of a single man at the top the rusty hierarchy is squeezing out just enough juice to keep the masses eke out an existence but always wanting for more the only exception is mad max who although an outsider has also given up on hope    on the other we have furiosa in the midst of a rebellious act fleeing this pathetic existence with the few drops of purity it birthed toward a green place through methodical hard work she came to possess just enough trust and power to escape  for redemption she said but we learn soon after that she needed hope more than anything and anyone    the attention to detail is astounding in the action movie which would normally just settle for a lot of cgi and loud sounds and which mmfr has plenty of the details are so abundant that they seem almost gratuitous the school yard lingo youd expect from a gang that maybe got stranded and grew up on an island and knows no one but each other the unusual arsenal of tricks and weaponry suited for road wars the war drums and flamethrowing electrical guitars that fulfill the role of military marches yet much more shrill and insane the skeletal arm drawing on the side of the rig these couldnt have possibly be fashioned by anyone other than someone absolutely obsessed with that violent and grotesque world someone who lived there for decades and who survived to tell the tale thats why this world like a powerful magnet clicks into place so naturally into a hole that was apparently there  no lengthy explanations are needed because the darkness it exposes lives in all of us    at one point i felt the anger so boundless i couldnt contain myself it just exited in a shriek and left me shaken to my core for the remainder of their journey i hesitate to call this an episode of a film for fear that it would diminish what it stirred it is belief in justice in freedom in peace that is defiled and trampled upon if we only give in to the darker demons of our nature  if what rules instead are greed bigotry and violence    what really got imprinted into my brain were the many mothers the old women with dry chuckles and winks and smiles were the most reassuring the most human sight of the entire spectacle  we need these women in our lives those who dont listen to the war cries and war horns but believe in their own righteousness and purity given the chance they will create and grow and nurture but they will fight with all their strength to preserve whats right when the have to if only men were not so caught up on their greed lust and war games we might have had a better kinder world if we trust our better nature we just might eventually
Nov 3 2016,positive,plot production design action cast all are amazing about this movie
Oct 29 2016,positive,hands down the greatest action movie ever made
Oct 29 2016,positive,wow again has just the back to real life feel that movies have been losing thanks mrmiller for your art form
Oct 28 2016,positive,a rare movie i can watch over and over for days and days
Oct 28 2016,positive,as a guy who wasnt a huge fan of the mad max franchise i had low expectations for this that being said i was blown away miller took me completely by surprise and gave me one of the best action movies ive ever seen
Oct 28 2016,positive,solid actioner with stunning visuals best picture candidate not on your nelly
Oct 24 2016,positive,a masterpiece one of the best and grittiest action movies just non stop actionand great performances
Oct 18 2016,positive,mad max fury road is george millers return to the franchise he started way back in 1979 with mad max i will start by saying this movie was absolutely batsh insane it was filled right to the brim with continuous over the top bloody ridiculous action sequences that keep you on the edge of the seat and just amazed at what is happening on screen now this film doesnt have much of a plot at all but seriously youre not going into this film for an intense plot this is a film that almost didnt even need one at all the one thing i was worried about going in was whether i needed to have seen the previous films to understand this one and thankfully you dont the story is independent of the previous film which was really helpful     the characters were all awesome and it did an amazing job to introduce them all almost instantly and get right into the action max tom hardy and furiosa charlize theron were were great and extremely likable characters even the villain who i will just call sweet tooth was so great he wasnt anything too special but was a great threat throughout the film     i just absolutely loved this movie intense action from start to finish and didnt slow down at all that made it ridiculously fun to watch the great characters and the performances are awesome on screen and were always interesting to watch if there was ever a twisted metal movie this is what it would be nothing really let the film down and everything really worked such a great time and the best cinema experience
Oct 16 2016,positive,brilliant absolutely brilliant
Oct 15 2016,positive,this movie is incredible one of my favorite action movies period up there with die hard and the first two terminator movies it is absolutely insane loaded with amazing action sequences and surprisingly a well developed between the main characters this is a mustsee and the best film of 2015 i love it more than inside out spotlight and star wars the force awakens i am dead serious
Oct 15 2016,positive,a masterpiece a filmmaking course
Oct 9 2016,positive,i thought this was better than the originals even though i loved the originals as well
Oct 9 2016,positive,exceptional production makes you remember that movie making is art i love the ending
Oct 8 2016,negative,my greatgrandfather used to say it takes little to amuse the simple  his point is exemplified in the overwhelming fandom of this tragically underwhelming liveaction cartoon  wholly lacking any character no real story to be acted out and more cgi than a handful of michael bay movies combined    i can only assume that fans of this flick that claim to be fans of the original truly only woke up to see the kid with the boomerang and the crazy dude in the gyrocopter after drinking themselves to a stupor during the movie itself
Oct 8 2016,negative,what a pointless piece of shit how can people like this shit like come on
Oct 6 2016,positive,just loved it to the bone its a piece of art a cinema lesson and a directorial resurrection makes you love movies
Oct 3 2016,negative,a horribly basic theme with stereotypic characters and a predictable story probably the worst movie ive seen this year
Oct 1 2016,positive,even for viewers unfamiliar with this series mad max thrusts us into a beautiful postapocalyptic world that awes us through start to finish amazing colors action sequences and brutality throughout tom hardy and charlize theron play off each other brilliantly even though they are silent for large portions of the movie none the less they add to the originality of the films action and story and with the help of a talented cast fury road earns its mark as one of the greatest films of the 21st century
Oct 1 2016,positive,that was a pretty wild movie
Sep 30 2016,positive,i dont understand why this movie has such a high rating  the movie was ok but not that great  you dont even really get a scavenger mad mad feel to the movie  this could have worked if tom hardy max was the main character in the movie and had more lines but it seems like he takes a back seat  hugh keays was an ok bad guy but this is fucking mad max we are talking here  he should be banishing families to the desert and putting people on pikes  the plot was pretty shitty also  it was a giant loop of retardation  starting at point a just to spend an hour and a half back at point a under bullshit reasons is wellbullshit  imperator furiosa theron seems like the main character in the film and it would have been ok if they fleshed out her character more but even her character is bland     the people rating this movie either made the movie or have no idea what a mad max movie is supposed to look like  this is an ok movie to watch after a couple of drinks but it doesnt deserve the rating it has
Sep 30 2016,positive,thanks to its flawless direction breathtaking sequences and thought provoking themes and imagery mad max fury road will be remembered as one of the best action films of all time
Sep 29 2016,positive,if you want a movie that will grow on you more and more every time you watch it this is a really good example the action goes by you at such a pace that you must watch it multiple times to really catch everything its a lot to take in and process the first time around this is truly a classic for the future and i have a feeling its going to be one of the greatest movies to come from this decade
Sep 28 2016,positive,went to see it with high excpections it was great but a very very weak plot
Sep 27 2016,positive,should have been called mad max furiosa  she is more the center of attention than max in this movie  since i adore postapocalyptic themes i did very much enjoy this movie  at one point though i did almost fall out of the movie seat laughing  the scene is serious and intenseand then in comes the heavy metal guitarist rofl  youll understand if you watch the movie
Sep 25 2016,negative,honestly dont understand what was good about this movie the story line was absolutely rocks in the head dumb on top of that the pictures made to bring that story line to life on the screen were made even worse by the director i cant waste any more time on this
Sep 23 2016,positive,visionary production design sound style and technical categories take fury road as far as they possibly can  however racooneyed furiosas sad sack search for redemption does not a story make
Sep 21 2016,positive,back in 1981 the road warrior rewrote the formula for action films and now in 2015 fury road rewrites the formula for films altogether this insane 120 minute ride of pure adrenaline is about as close to perfection as there is the greatest 80s action film to not come out of the 80s
Sep 21 2016,neutral,one of the most overrated films on rt and certainly the most overrated in 2015  i was looking forward to this film simply due to positive ratings and my appreciation for the mad max franchise      it was truly shocking to see this overrated film was  it reinforced my disappointment in how this industry nurtures a groupthink mentality amongst its professional critics  however i can understand the general publics groupthink adulation of this action film    the female heroine or you gogirl trend in hollywood is taken to its extreme in this film almost similar to 300 rise of an empire 2014  it was so intentional that the rest of the plotline was lost on me as it seemed this was simply a feminist flick to endorse strong female lead characters    there were excellently produced action scenes things being blown up to satisfy those members of the viewing public that paid good money to watch such things  however this was not a work of art  the original mad max was original
Sep 21 2016,negative,while the visuals were amazing and the story was decent neither were enough to overcome the constant onslaught of action too many times i found myself looking at my watch to see how much time had elapsed only to see no time at all had passed     if you do not mind a 2 hour car chase watch it enjoy but for my money this was time wasted
Sep 18 2016,positive,now having never seen the original mad max films i wasnt sure what to expect with this but really enjoyed this film the cast was fantastic the stunts were incredible and the story was gripping
Sep 17 2016,positive,tom hardy and charlize theron are good but i dont like the story plot maybe if i watch the old ones i will understand it better but sadly i dont
Sep 17 2016,neutral,i have never been a fan of postapocalyptic films but fury roads characters and cinematography were enough to keep me interested and its plot and acting also were pluses overall the only aspect that kept me from rating this film higher is the ridiculous stunts and at times cheesy attempts to appeal to the younger generation
Sep 16 2016,positive,few movies have i enjoyed as much as this one
Sep 14 2016,positive,incredibly fun to watch with amazing visuals if the story was a little bit more understandable this wouldve been the perfect summer action movie
Sep 14 2016,positive,i was skeptical about fury road but its now my favorite action film its a perfect action flick with a lot on its mind
Sep 13 2016,negative,found the premise of movie to be dull and 1 dimensionalfound it impossible to connect with the characters started yawning about half way through thumbs down
Sep 12 2016,positive,mad max fury road is probably the best action movie of the decade and is one of the best action movies of all time the action is exciting the acting is great especially charlize theron the story isnt very deep but is a good story for an action movie and is a great return to form for george miller
Sep 12 2016,positive,one of the best movies that i have seen in a long time its essentially one big long chase sequence filled with practical effects and george millers strangeyetintriguing style i was interested in the movie from start to finish and it was a refreshing break from all the cheese and corny transformersesque garbage that we usually see in movies these days
Sep 10 2016,positive,masterpiece not a remake thank god just a high octane roller coaster full of thrills
Sep 10 2016,positive,really good movie  would have been better with a little more dialogue and a little less grunting from max
Sep 9 2016,positive,one of the best action movies ever brilliantly acted visually impressive and overloaded with awesome action stunts and special effects
Sep 5 2016,negative,what am i watching this should have been titled furiosa fury road with a cameo from mad max  i heard this was great because of the nonstop brain dead action which it has but sadly this is a severe departure from the first three max isnt mad insane hes mad angry as evident by the originals im sure the franchise train will keep rolling and force another sequel down our throats and there will be plenty to gobble it up
Sep 4 2016,positive,george miller proves that age is not a factor as he returns to the franchise he created with the best installment yet charlize theron takes us and tom hardy on a nonstop action thrillride that leaves viewers begging for another installment while the plot is virtually nonexistent  fury road more than makes up for it with strong characters and an amazing visuals if you havent seen fury road youre missing out on the best movie of 2015
Sep 4 2016,negative,senseless computerized action a waste of time
Sep 3 2016,positive,everybody is saying that it is one of the best action movies ever and they are right
Sep 3 2016,positive,really wierd but really really good   an absolute joy to watch every second is exhilarating possibly the best car chases ever a use of effects that adds to the film instead of distracting from whats happening   masterpiece a film i wont easily forget
Sep 3 2016,positive,its extraordinary i love the first scense of this movie  this movie had great start and diffent end
Sep 2 2016,positive,finally  an updaterehash that is completely worthy of the original      honestly one of the best action films i have ever seen  its completley beautiful and the acting is much stronger than the best this genre usually has to offer  outstanding    if you have been skipping this out of fearlove of the 80s films see it immediately  you wont be disappointed
Sep 2 2016,negative,i was hugely disappointed worst film ive seen for years    firstly its not a mad max film the character thats supposed to be max does not have maxs personality and does not seem to have maxs past either max did not have a daughter there is no attempt to link the events in the previous films to this one    that does not necessarily make it a bad film in its own right though complete lack of plot characterisation and realism do that i didnt find my self caring about any of the characters they just seem to be mindless automatons max was always fairly stoic and terse in the old films but in this one he barely says a word the action is relentless and there are no breaks to discover anything about any of the characters  the film also suffers from inconsistent tone lurching from cartoony violence on one hand to serious issues like slavery on the other it feels rather like waterworld in this regard    the film was widely praised for its feminism which i find bizarre there is nothing feminist about this film yes the protagonist is female but she acts like a man the message is basically to be strong woman has to become a man contrast this with a genuine female action character like ellen ripley from alien the ripley character could not have been played by a man  the other female characters are in two groups the antagonists harem  five beautiful helpless waifs who need rescuing and the vuvalini tribe the vuvalini tribe are at least somewhat more interesting middleaged women rarely appear in action roles however they are almost all killed off as cannon fodder without really leaving any impression    the first two mad max films had a gritty realism to them their setting was just about plausible and the plot was completely believable beyond thunderdome lost a bit of this but fury road does away with it completely and goes pure comicbook everyones a hero wounds are shrugged off guns have infinite ammo some people obviously like this style but for me it just makes it boring    there are some good points the film is beautiful some of the action sequences are very good
Aug 31 2016,positive,intense nonestop thriller action  underwhelming performance by tom hardy however  more like mad furiosa furry road
Aug 30 2016,positive,even if the plot is lacking depth of narrative this film is a nonstop thrill ride thatll have even the toughest of viewers on the edge of their seat this is how action is supposed to be filmed
Aug 30 2016,positive,lively vibrant and exuberant mad max fury road is a mustwatch as it delivers with superb flamboyant action lives up to the hype and is a blockbuster success
Aug 30 2016,positive,fantastic charlize is superb
Aug 28 2016,positive,great visuals and you can really get absorbed into the postapocalyptic world  but the story is very simplistic and undesirable
Aug 24 2016,positive,okay sit down buckle up and enjoy the ride this film has everything for action fans george miller delivers stunning imagery and a cleverly interesting plot the main characters deliver with believable performances the action sequences which are many are jaw dropping and get your heart pumping  this is the best all around action film in many yearsimho
Aug 24 2016,positive,it looks amazing but they drive somewhere turn around and go home the end
Aug 23 2016,positive,i have never wanted a movie to not end so badly in my entire life
Aug 23 2016,positive,one of the greatest action movie ever made
Aug 23 2016,positive,one of the best action movies ever
Aug 23 2016,positive,mad max is exhilarating intense moments enough narrative heft great performance great customes and the action were fantastic although i havent seen the original mad max but this rebootsequel was grreat george miller brought the postapocalyptic franchise back to life
Aug 20 2016,positive,awesome just wish there was more and maxs character should have had more lines
Aug 19 2016,positive,great acting amazing action spectacular practical effects while it may seem like its short on plotit just shows you what and how it is so you can connect the dots a revitalization of a long dead franchisecant wait for the sequel
Aug 17 2016,positive,this film is a rarity a big budget continuation of a classic franchise which last released a film 30 years ago and is arguably the best of them all the plot elements are most similar to the road warrior but are updated and executed unbelievably well miller has stated that he already had written a new trilogy that he wanted to finish out with unfortunately after this film wb and miller are in a draw stuck in a legal battle which will likely prevent the last two from ever being made
Aug 16 2016,positive,this movie was entertaining from start to finish couldnt believe it really i im not the biggest fan of action movies but its probably going to develop a cultlike following deserving
Aug 16 2016,positive,mindless action while incredibly well done gets boring after 2 hours
Aug 16 2016,positive,few films get 5 stars this one does near flawless that said it must be stated that this movie is a blantant and total ripoff of the original star wars trilogy
Aug 14 2016,negative,pros  visually appealing  action  artistic     cons  barely any plot   on and off bad acting   uninteresting   not as good as the originals
Aug 14 2016,positive,mad max fury road was sheer madness that isnt sullied with horrendous acting or dull dialogue its a damn blockbuster that is intense and doesnt have a sense of humor that could equated to a fluffy kitten its george millers attempt to reignite his long dormant mad max franchise and my god does he ever he single handedly delivers our saving grace in the genre of action with a blind zombie playing a fire breathing electric guitar on the back of an oil rig if you dont love that than why do you watch action films
Aug 14 2016,positive,brilliant movie i cant wait to see the next one
Aug 14 2016,positive,i made me felt awake all the story go
Aug 13 2016,positive,im not sure if i shouldve seen the other mad max movies to really understand what was going on  all that being said i had no idea what the actually story line was but i didnt care cause there was so much awesome action and amazing visuals that i couldve cared less about the what the actual story was about this coming from a guy who really enjoys great storylines and not much action in the films he watches ill probably have to watch it a few more times to understand what was really going on there
Aug 13 2016,negative,how can this fucken piece of crap shit movie get 97 it is utterly one of the most boring movies of all time no character development no cities vilains are jokes guys plays guitar some random scenes that makes no sense just a barren waste land and cars chasing and that gets a better review then fucking inception batman the dark knight lord of the ring etc like wth its shit that gets clogged in your toilet
Aug 12 2016,positive,one of the best films of 2015but he has a story like another more it  change history in the middle of the film
Aug 11 2016,positive,there are times when a film is so engrossing and immersive not just with visual flair but with raw perfect talent given by both the actors and crew you have no choice but to say holy st thats exactly what i did at the end of this film  10  10     yes its effects driven but includes an amazingly emotional storyline and atmosphere
Aug 10 2016,positive,mad max is a rare movie the script isnt that complex or creative or ingenious the performances and the direction on the other hand are so masterfully executed that you hardly note the sometimes dumb plotholes charlize theron proves again that her great performances do not rely on her beauty but on her great talent she is the real star of the movie and frankly carries a tom hardy who hardly just appears and groans not that his character demand much more overall the movie is great in the sense that you can feel how george miller cares about this franchise this baby of his that he so carefuly organized and turned into one of the best actionscifi movies of the last decades
Aug 10 2016,positive,its amazing how they fit all that in 120 minutes
Aug 10 2016,positive,mad max fury road is a master of action we wondered if miller would ever top the road warrior and our answer was yes exhilarating fun beautiful and a surprising amount of character depth was found in the simple premise of fury road
Aug 9 2016,positive,loved this from beginning to end action action action
Aug 8 2016,positive,the entire movie is a car chase
Aug 8 2016,negative,i usually like movies that are a little different  this was just weird and never really caught me
Aug 8 2016,positive,somehow  a film exists which can appeal equally to people who appreciate  dune and the fast and the furious
Aug 7 2016,positive,a movie so visually striking from the first frame to the last that youll think youve gotten lockjaw by the end from watching the whole thing openmouthed an absolute visual feast and a triumph of cinematograghy directing acting and editing the story though fairly straightforward is interesting enough to keep you engaged and is relentlessy action packed a couple of somewhat macabre moments come off as somehow amusing but clearly intentionally so the 3d version also looks great with the depth adding another level to the overall experience a real must see
Aug 7 2016,negative,wasted hours of my life i wont get back not sure how anyone could have liked this film garbage after garbage not a compelling story sucked
Aug 7 2016,positive,puts michael bay to shame
Aug 7 2016,positive,while this postapocalyptic thrill ride will definitely not suit everybody mad max fury road pumps an extraordinary amount of energy into the concept in the form of great acting exhilarating action and some surprising narrative heft not for the faint hearted or those wanting a relaxing movie  verdict a
Aug 7 2016,positive,it has everything a mad max movie should havetimes ten a roller coaster of nonstop action sequences left me out of breath
Aug 7 2016,positive,heres one of those movies when the lead character had been overshadowed by a supporting character due to acting charlize theron as furiosa was more compelling it is also empowering for women and persons with disabilities to see her character come to life
Aug 7 2016,positive,this is one of the best movie i have ever see
Aug 5 2016,positive,filming was amazing editing was amazing characters were amazing strong feminist message and environmentalism only criticism is that it didnt go on for longer
Aug 5 2016,positive,another movie that is good  not worth a 97but good
Aug 5 2016,negative,horrible it is just a 2 hours persecution with an excess of unnecessary violence the story is just as bad as the crazy and ugly characters
Aug 5 2016,positive,awesome perfect love it
Aug 4 2016,positive,george millers reboot of the beloved franchise hits the mark in every way the action is incredible filmed and executed and what makes it even more impressive is that it was mostly practical effects with barely any cgi the cast give amazing performances with everybody doing incredible well the stand out had to be charlize theron who is incredible as furiosa it is filmed amazingly and even though the plot isnt the best in the world it is still a very fun action film
Aug 4 2016,positive,almost 24 hours after i saw mad max fury road and i think the adrenaline is still pumping through my veins a thrilling twohour ride through george millers postapocalyptic wasteland fury road is the best movie 2015 has seen so far    i will not lie being a fan of mad max and the road warrior millers first two stories following max rockatansky in his world i was skeptical when i heard there would be a fourth movie i have avoided watching mad max beyond thunderdome full disclosure upon hearing it was miller who would be at the helm again it put my mind at ease my expectations were fully set when i found out the superb tom hardy inception the dark knight rises bronson would be playing the titular role    the film begins at breakneck speed and continues at that pace right up to the very end  with maybe a ten minute break in the middle which allows the audience to catch their breath and ease back into their seats within the first three minutes we have our first flipped car  maxs  and he is captured by minions of immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne who played the villain toecutter in the original mad max  a nice homage to the past by miller a dictatorial warlord who seems to have complete control over the population of the capital hewn into the rock in the wasteland desert the ensuing chase scene when max attempts a daring escape from the capital sets the pace for the rest of the film as max races through the tunnels jumping over cars jumping out of the structures onto crane hookskeeping in mind that 80 of the films stunts were real action and not cgi this is a pretty cool chase but not even the films finest the chase that is the next hour and fifty minutes is even better    among the populous of the capital are nux nicolas hoult xmen first class and imperator furiosa charlize theron monster two very different characters nux one of joes war boys is a sickly lad whose only two real friends are growths in his shoulder which he has tattooed smiley faces on this should give you a sense of the common person in joes forces his ultimate goal is the same as the other war boys to bring back the escaped fugitives achieve joes recognition and upon death arrive at valhalla    furiosa has committed the crime of stealing joes wives five beautiful girls who he has been breeding with in order to try and further his population driving a warrig filled with gasoline a valuable item in this world furiosa sets out with the wives to try and find a new home free of joes terror    max is pulled into all of this by virtue of being a universal blood donor and spends a good portion of time with an iron mask over his face attached to the front of nuxs car hardy proves his acting chops here as he did in 2012s the dark knight rises by acting with only his eyes as he reacts to the gunfire explosions and wild stunts occurring around him as his car speeds through the desert    the rest of the film is essentially a long car chase that left me breathless at several points millers penchant for dramatic stunts is accompanied by strong performances by hardy and theron while hoult provides a craziness to nux that offsets the calmess of max a man of many words max doesnt speak until nearly half an hour into the film and while he speaks more than he does in the road warrior he never delves into lengthy explanations his longest lines are delivered with hesitancy and many pauses reflecting his lack of conversations over the years    therons furiosa essentially becomes the films true hero since max is viewed as an antihero in many ways furiosa is a woman of determination who still has hope for a better place that as max reminds her may not exist this sense of optimism is not as present in millers other max films but theron captures it without being carried away by it and when she realizes it is not to be she switches back seamlessly into her goaloriented self who is just trying to keep the wives alive    a spinepounding score by junkie xl accents the action which goes on on the screen making it an action movie opera of sorts which the majority of the action taking place in car chases as is the common theme among all mad max films miller has said in interviews that the whole script was actually written and presented in storyboard form allowing the action to be fully fleshed out to the best it possibly can be filled with homages and references to the first set of mad max films it also works well as a standalone film so those who havent seen the originals dont have to feel the need to prior to seeing this i would recommend them though    after seeing fury road its almost hard to believe miller is the same mastermind behind the two happy feet films but easy to remember that he created this world that max inhabits my world is fire and blood proclaims max in the opening voiceover and he is 100 right the action is fast but unlike some recent action films the action never seems too fast the cuts and shots are quick enough to reflect the high tension and action but not so quick as to have the audience lose their bearings or fall behind in confusion    while spectacular acting might not be required in such a visually striking film the alisters deliver as mentioned with hardy theron and hoult leading the way hoults mad antics particularly in the early stages of the film counterbalance nicely with the grim coolness of hardy and therons characters it should be noted that i did not even think about mel gibson or what he might have done with the role in this film once during it which should stand as a testament to hardys performance keaysbyrne is as intimidating and terrific as he was in 1978 and the women who portray the five wives definitely dont reflect the typical traits of damsels in distress this is as much a testament to millers storyboard script as it is to the acting skills of the women in question led by rose huntingtonwhiteley    some viewers may say that mad maxfury road lacks plot story and even character development but i dont know if any of that is necessary in the actionpacked thrill ride that is the most recent product of george millers marvelous imagination
Aug 4 2016,positive,mad movie totally different from the series it was so fascinating i couldnt take my eyes off as soon as the movie begins strongly recommend to watch
Aug 3 2016,positive,my third favorite actor meets my original first favorite actress visávis yes please neither disappointed and together they brought george millers artistic view of a postapacolyptic world to the screen the film was beautiful funny and insane which are all things youd probably want from a mad max movie
Aug 3 2016,positive,this movie is ridiculously overrated by its fans who seem to mainly consist of adhd suffering millennials thrilled by a movie so filled with action set pieces that even if they forgot to take their ritalin they wont have time to be bored with pesky things like dialog and character development before the next explosion its a summer blockbuster and it certainly succeeds on that level but so do the fast and furious movies but those arent usually held up by critics as great film making as is being done by a lot of critics with fury road we do at least have a comprehensible plot the character motivations are for the most part reasonable the postapocalyptic insanity of millers world itself undoubtedly appeals to the video game crowd but at the end of the day it just plays like a more nihilistic water world people running around blowing things up without creating any emotional attachment for the audience or spending the time necessary to delve into its deeper themes at more than a surface level it may be better than the average blockbuster but dont be fooled into believing that makes it a better than average movie
Aug 3 2016,positive,the best movie from 21st century
Aug 3 2016,positive,basically one big very well done car chase less bondage gear this time
Aug 3 2016,negative,i give it one full star because of the really good visuals cinematography and action sequences choreography i mean this movie should have been the sequel mr miller am i right after the 10 storytelling at the beginning youre foisted with 2 hours of nonstop adrenaline rush and intense madness which sounds okay if you are into that but there is just no chance to enjoy such a piece without vomiting at some point its like a techno club youre pumped as you walk inside but after 1 hour you just want to blow your head clean off and lay on the ground for a little bit it gets annoying quickly and even the great hardy  theron presence cant get it on the right side of the road the only right this really big action scene did was that it left viewers wanting more at the end because they pretty much received no actual development throughout the whole movie it can grow into a very nice franchise as it predecessor did if they invest a little more effort in the story
Aug 2 2016,positive,the best action film since ever visually and technically phenomenal fury road brings out the best in itself while adding an element of surprise heart    thats right theres a story and its a good one too the surface will make itself out to be a nonstop bloodbath but and while thats not completely false its just simply not true there is symbolism for a bigger picture in this film and there is a sense of chaos and sadness that is almost palpable in some of the more dramatic scenes throughout an absolute wonder
Aug 1 2016,positive,well that was amazing amazing attention to detail continuous adrenal rush badassed female heroic lead super creative glad i finally saw this 
Jul 31 2016,positive,amazing movie stayed true to the original
Jul 30 2016,negative,one of the worst movies ive ever seen a part of saw it in the theatre the first time and walked out after repeatedly thinking why the hell am i wasting my time watching this crap saw rave reviews all around and decided to give it another go made it to the rediculous guitardude strapped to an ampwagon deleted it off my harddrive 0003 seconds later    im reading reviews to understand how anyone could possibly enjoy this heap of nonsense but i just dont get it who cares about cinematography or real vs cgi when youre watching the absolute worst film of all time there is no story no direction every character is ridiculously underdeveloped and the world that its set in isnt even constructed according to the laws of whats possible and what isnt still people rave about how meticulously it is designed and how its a metaphore for the underlying storyline am i delusional is everyone else
Jul 30 2016,neutral,mad max fury road is the kind of movie that should have vin diesel or megan fox in it but instead the producers use oscarnominated names to try to get viewers to take the movie seriously and yet the basic premise for mad max fury road seemed to be initially written by a little boy with matchbox cars the story evolving slowly into a premise wellsuited for a lowlevel video game     full review 
Jul 29 2016,negative,this is one of the dumbest most hollow pieces of shit i have ever seen in my life
Jul 28 2016,positive,mad max fury road came out of nowhere and was a fun exhilarating joy ride throughout the entire film when the soundtrack booms as exciting action plays you cant help but feel adrenaline rushing through your veins everything was great about it but if it had more of a story it would be perfect
Jul 28 2016,negative,really best movie of 2015
Jul 28 2016,positive,an actionpacked movie which told a moving story driven by its characters and the world in which they inhabit
Jul 28 2016,positive,very over hyped an average movie at best i commend the use of practical effect over cg and the acting is spot on but the movie is a combination of a thousand postapocalypse movie before it
Jul 27 2016,positive,watched this movie a year after the immense hype surrounding it had dissipated and yet i still left pleasantly surprised the worldbuilding elements of this movie worked so well and the action was beautifully choreographed and executed
Jul 27 2016,positive,great in everyway picture acting editing and storyline
Jul 26 2016,positive,riveting probably more action than ive ever seen in one movie and you actually care about the characters simultaneously
Jul 26 2016,negative,the plot is badthe pace is badthe dialogue is badits incredibly boringthe only redeemable thing about it is the visuals
Jul 26 2016,positive,i actually liked this movie but they should of got mel gibson for a cameo other than that it was a great time
Jul 24 2016,positive,it was really fun to watch if you in the mood for little dialog
Jul 24 2016,positive,action action and action  wow  this was amazing 
Jul 24 2016,negative,horrible movie  took me about three or four sessions to get through it  i looked up the reviews which said the movie was great so i decided to finish  wish i hadnt  on the plus side im glad i didnt pay money to see this movie  this movie is a car chase shooting explosions motorcycles and a guitar player rinse and repeat ad nauseum welcome to the department of redundancy department  i have no explanation why so many people would think this is some sort of masterpiece it isnt
Jul 23 2016,positive,its the perfect guy movie  things blow up for a while they pause while girls wearing white shower down  then things blow up the rest of the movie
Jul 23 2016,positive,great entertainmentwell cast roles
Jul 19 2016,positive,yes 5 stars a rating a thrill ride til the end the week it came out to theaters i saw it 3 times if the first week  this was well worth the wait and hopefully i dont have to wait so long for a follow up
Jul 18 2016,positive,one of the best action movies of all time
Jul 17 2016,positive,how george miller got away with this is beyond me i like to imagine he had snipers on the set with orders to shoot any execs who showed up
Jul 16 2016,positive,a captured nomad and a woman on a crusade come together against hoards of enemies takes about 60seconds to get moving and rarely lets up from then on the action scenes are among the best ever filmed while the characters show compassion even through meager roles one of the most exciting and insane movies in existence
Jul 16 2016,positive,with ground breaking cinematography and a crazy post apocalyptic world mad max fury road simply does not live up to the hype laid out by critics though im not one to complain about unwarranted action i will complain if that action is unjustified by a weak story line not much can be said about a films story where the main goal is to drive into the desert and drive back the film is not bad but a 97
Jul 16 2016,negative,i dont get all the love for this movie for a film with an rrating his could have been way more violent
Jul 15 2016,positive,love that tom hardy can bring so much depth just by a series of grunts charlize is my hero can we name our daughter furiosa
Jul 15 2016,positive,right lets get some things off the bat its great fantastic wonderful if you like action movies this is kind of the neplus ultra but there is a problem and its a really really big one namely its too long about half an hour too longand its only 2 hours so about a quarter of it needs to go i dont care if its amazing stuff kill your darlings if youd never shown the film no one would notice it gone the last time we had a film that we could say how great it is to have a summer blockbuster thats actually fantastic and gets nominated for loads of oscars was gravity and that was 90 minutes long and was essentially an exploitation film with a huge budget got in told the taut thriller got out wonderful when a quarter of your film gets tiring especially in a film of this kind of break neck pacing thats a major problem     now dont get me wrong i love the film i own it on dvd the cinematography is amazing the effects stunning and oscar winning the costumes even more amazing and also oscar winning no where else will you find a blockbuster film showing in multiplexes with a major antagonist wearing nipple clamps im sorry but that alone will make it always have a place in my heart     taut pacing a convincing world as immersive as blade runner and several kick ass ladies make mad max fury road a success and an instruction manual for how to do hollywood action in the future
Jul 15 2016,positive,with strong direction astounding visuals and grand set pieces mad max fury road proves you dont need an indepth story to create one of the greatest action films of all time using strong lead characters a postapocalyptic background and a whole lot of mesmerizing action scenes taking place in one car ride
Jul 15 2016,positive,no movie should ever get 5 stars theres always room for improvement with that said this one gets as close to 5 stars as it can if you are a mad max fan watch this amazing chemistry between charlize theron and tom hardy the stunts driving score acting and costume design was about as perfect as you can get maybe later ill do a more thorough review but for now i will leave it as this if you are a fan of action post apocalypse settings strong acting and gripping story lines see this movie
Jul 13 2016,positive,complex but great movie to watch
Jul 13 2016,negative,the worst movie i have ever seen
Jul 13 2016,positive,this became one of my favorite movies of all time director george miller created a masterpiece charlize theron as furiosa she will be remembered as an icon just like sigourney weaver in aliens and linda hamilton in terminator 2 mad max fury road is one of the greatest films ever made and will most definitely be remembered as a classic of the 21st century the movie is absolutely amazing beautiful  incredibly made  i love it i love it what a day what a lovely day
Jul 12 2016,positive,when i first saw the trailer for this film i said to myself its just another cash grab from a franchise that was once very good for the first two installments then turned sour with the third however now that ive seen this film ive realised thats its true craftsman  ship the director wanted to make something great and i could tell and in the final result he did the cinematography in this film is spectacular avatar level i would say with outstanding action and beautiful shots of a desert i felt like i was there the cons of this film its called mad max fury road not the furiousa movie charlize theron stole the spotlight from hardy for a fourth installment its a great film and a mile stone in cinema
Jul 10 2016,positive,a blockbuster film that makes all others blockbuster look generic
Jul 10 2016,negative,compared to the last three this movie is a big piece of shit first off i hate cgi with a passion  what i would like to see is mel gibson as an old man max it would make sense considering the timeline then they could have added any side kick as his costar   postapocalyptic movies are obviously fantasy but this one tops the cake its not even halfway real feeling theres no mystery theres definitely no suspense  very little story i dont understand the direction of this movie  other than the bad cgi
Jul 10 2016,positive,if remakes  or reinventions were this good nobody would ever complain
Jul 9 2016,negative,nope the video game had a more memorable plot
Jul 9 2016,negative,not as good as the other mad max movies with mel gibson  the only thing i liked was the intense action in later half of it
Jul 9 2016,positive,i expected more but is a good movie 
Jul 8 2016,positive,what a amazing achievement to use little cgi and make the affects look good
Jul 7 2016,positive,an unrelenting fastfaced thriller mad max fury road manages to keep you on the edge of your seat the whole way through
Jul 6 2016,negative,so the australian  apocalypse is filled with bald pale people bob will fit right in
Jul 6 2016,positive,tom hardy filmed movie in 20 words
Jul 5 2016,positive,bazaar plot lots of action but good
Jul 4 2016,positive,it was ok but the feminist message was lame
Jul 4 2016,positive,mad max fury road is a film where not only does it outsmart star wars but it also is what i think is the best movie of the decade
Jul 4 2016,positive,better then i thought dont know if theres a 3 coming but i hope there is its like borderlands irl
Jul 3 2016,positive,pretty cool movie the story and plot here is amzing just wasnt entertained enough
Jul 3 2016,positive,this is nothing similar to what i had watched before in motion pictures for the past 20 years seriously although the plot is somehow too simple without much twists in it all the actions and the special effects of the movie were able to cover up that little shortcoming of the movie
Jul 2 2016,positive,this is a story that realizes heavily on practical effects and cinematography but with that the acting is great and the action scenes are amazing this best picture nominee proves to us that not all action movies have to be the same generic plot and ill admit i saw this movie uninterested in the beginning but once i saw the whole thing i was extremely impressed ive never even seen the originals but im ready for the next one
Jun 29 2016,positive,first i need to make it clear i still love the road warrior very much so i didnt find this as better or worse than trw but equally as entertaining and great so much so that it could stand on its own without any of the previous films had it been made by itself the action is great the scenery spectacular and charlize kicking some major ass i can kind of see why people may have thought this was feminist driven because in some of the scenes they really did water down maxs ability to be a badass while he had some great scenes i think it would of been better had a couple of the scenes actually allowed him to show and strut his own stuff but its of minor consequence in the long run as it didnt hurt the movie any and more of just a personal preference for me as the viewer im also convinced that this is supposed to take place after the first 3 due to some of the flashbacks in the film i also loved the fact that there were more groups of villains than just the ones from the citadel as it certainly added to more of the mayhem overall loved this flick as it wasnt a letdown at all    1010
Jun 29 2016,positive,i can talk about this movie eternallybut i can also combine everything in three wordsextremly fuing amazing
Jun 22 2016,positive,great acton film none stop thrill ride
Jun 21 2016,positive,mad max fury road bring back the universe for the fourth time and its loud intense and everything a mad max fan was probably hoping for a really well done movie full of amazing stunts and action that looks so amazing on screen  definitely one of the greatest action movies so far on film
Jun 21 2016,positive,the turbulent speed in the movie leaves no space for developing of the personality characters the action is linear without any twists and dialogues are minimized although the action is not boring mainly due to the strong performance of charlize theron if it is removed there remains almost nothing from the movie it is visually interesting but a little boring and long     this is the first mad max movie that received academy award winning six of ten nominations it was nominee for the best picture too but maybe the reason was paying tribute to the complete mad max franchise fury road is hyper accelerated chase on the road to hell in a postapocalyptic world but it is a ride that is worth watching
Jun 21 2016,negative,im not with the mad max movies or games
Jun 19 2016,positive,the turbulent speed in the movie leaves no space for developing of the personality characters the action is linear without any twists and dialogues are minimized although the action is not boring mainly due to the strong performance of charlize theron if it is removed there remains almost nothing from the movie it is visually interesting but a little boring and long     this is the first mad max movie that received academy award winning six of ten nominations it was nominee for the best picture too but maybe the reason was paying tribute to the complete mad max franchise fury road is hyper accelerated chase on the road to hell in a postapocalyptic world but it is a ride that is worth watching
Jun 19 2016,positive,the best mad max yet by far
Jun 18 2016,negative,this movie sucks  why do so many people like it  i dont get it
Jun 15 2016,negative,dumb like the drums it rides onworst plot just ridiculously stupid fight scenes and zero character development with a plot that literally goes nowhere and is more than predictable and unexciting  it took me 4 viewing to get through it
Jun 15 2016,negative,i simply do not understand how this can be near the top it made my eyes bleed to watch it was so poor maybe people like special effects for their ownsake
Jun 14 2016,negative,one of the most overrated films ive ever paid to see a snooze fest with zero dialog zero character development  zero plot im sure there will be a sequelthat i wont watch
Jun 12 2016,positive,such an excellent movie with the great cast and storyline the visual effects is fantastic too
Jun 12 2016,negative,possibility the worst thing i have ever seen no lines no explanation of visions or events and terrible special effects i am very glad that i didnt pay to see it at the theater
Jun 12 2016,negative,while it has nice visuals and cinematography the story just isnt there this flows more like a video game where its basically long drawn out car chases broken up by a few short cutscenes it doesnt really have a developed coherent plot if you like visually stunning mindless action i could would see where this would be appealing its just not for me
Jun 12 2016,negative,a 2 hour long car chase  yawn i dont get the hype at all visual effects were great but after about half an hour you begin to realize that nothing different will happen for the rest of the movie
Jun 11 2016,positive,this movie is amazing there is so much detail in the characters and action great
Jun 11 2016,positive,george miller returns to the mad max universe with a visually dazzling film that places the story on the backburner this movie is about hairraising action and stunts bizarre characters outlandish costumes and a stark landscape millers movie delivers on all of those fronts despite this i still wanted to connect with the characters instead the movie kept me at arms length even with the underdeveloped subplot regarding human trafficking mad max fury road is a technical marvel and it is easily one of the best action films from 2015 that being said it is nowhere close to topping millers first two mad max entries which put mel gibson and miller on the map
Jun 11 2016,positive,what a great fun movie it even has a good story to tell so thats good the action is so stylized and cool that even if there was a badlytold story i wouldnt really mind i agree with yms on this one this should be called mad max fun road
Jun 11 2016,positive,im not antiremake in fact there are a lot of movies from my childhood and before that where i think they could really use a remake mad max is one of those 80s movies where after rewatching it as an adult it really doesnt hold up so when i heard they were doing a new version of mad max i welcomed it it really needed another try this is one of those rare remakes where the new version completely blows away the original its not even close tremendous action some stunning visuals  it was great
Jun 10 2016,positive,the only mistake on this movie is that it ends this is simply beautiful
Jun 10 2016,negative,so over rated its nonot stop action and thats a bad thing yes  i love action suspense etc but way try hard and over stimulating  i feel asleep 3 times trying 2 watch this boo to ratings number one movie my a 
Jun 9 2016,positive,incredible action sequences well made indepth characters outstanding production value thrilling and almost everything you could wish for in an action movie without a mixed up mess like other movies sure to be loved my mad max fans and others also
Jun 9 2016,positive,subtlety is a luxury this film doesnt desire dwelling upon if youre not a fan of explosions and roaring engines this isnt for you however whats left is a classic story enjoyable to all and a thrilling blockbuster experience for those who have the proper home theater setups i give it a 45 because this isnt exactly a genre i personally enjoy but it shines as a powerful film regardless
Jun 9 2016,positive,every scene was action action action and action oh and did i did i mention action too this movie is the best action movie my eyes ever laid upon there were thrills and other elements that really fit well in the film and because of that i literally never looked away it didnt make its atmphosphere  too dark like id  expect from the start because of the backstory and such and beacause of that i really really had fun with this film if you didnt like this then go see a doctor
Jun 7 2016,negative,im not sure if everyone is mental blind or 8 years old i love these actors and i love action thrillers this was a hodge podge of terribly executed film terrible story poor acting lack of substance
Jun 5 2016,positive,the best movie i have ever seen
Jun 5 2016,positive,one of the top 3 best movies of 2015
Jun 5 2016,negative,one of the worst movies ive seen this year the script was especially terribly written cinematography was well executed though overall waste of time watching this film
Jun 4 2016,positive,there is no question that this film is a thrilling ride firing on all cylinders from nearly the very first frame  it is beautiful to look at and artdirected to high heaven with that postapocalyptic australianoutback feel though it was filmed in namibia there are also female characters in some key lead roles a welcome thing for an action movie including charlize theron as badass onearmed furiosa who starts the plot rolling by escaping with the creepy bad guys five wives to a remembered matriarchal outpost across the desert which turns out to be decimated by climate change but with a small band of bikies still led by some very tough old ladies  so the movie is an endless chase at top speeds in phantasmagorical hot rods and supertrucks taking in a variety of vistas and oddlydressed tribes along the way  but thats all it is  in other words a gloriously wellrealized moment in an imagined dystopic future populated by brutal characters that we never really get to know particularly tom hardy who has taken over the role of max from mel gibson so take a deep breath hold on enjoy the rush and then it is over not unlike your increasingly sophisticated roller coaster experience
Jun 4 2016,positive,this movie is so amazing so perfect that i am genuinely worried when well see anything like it again this was a film that i dont think anyone wanted but its the one film we all needed it is perfect     as someone who adores classics from the 80s such as aliens the terminators the indiana jones and star warsetc its great to have a movie that the next generation will look back on in 30 years like i do to the aformentioned movies
Jun 4 2016,positive,theres nothing like the old school directed by a 70yearold director who can be more energetic fresh inventive and imaginative who knows how to have a wonderful look on the woman who is the one who can give life hope and comfort in a world dominated by violence from  oppression and tyranny furious played by beautiful charlize theron tough and gritty is the one who moves history and goes open our hearts we mind to a max played by a taciturn and talented tom hardy a mention are the images that offer us a world adrift but of great impact and beauty thanks to a superb direction the action scenes are something that either bay or snyder could have in a great directing as he would miller
Jun 3 2016,negative,teeeeerrrrrrribbbbllleeee lacked interest plot story coherence and generally mad max
Jun 2 2016,negative,complete garbage no plot no point lousy characters the guy playing max is a bore its all cgi with people engaged in combat while driving really fast  weve already seen that  it was called thunderdome and thunderdome did it much better  preachy politically correct hollywood drivel dripping with cgi thats why some critics loved it so much but its really a pointless waste of time
Jun 2 2016,negative,flat story nothing happens just cruisin around in the sands
Jun 1 2016,positive,mad max starts a out a little psychotic in this episode the whole thing was a chase scene
Jun 1 2016,positive,one of the best action movies of the decade seldom do i give a 5 star rating since even good movies have flaws but this one has so little of them and such does not even matter    outstanding sound effects and use of colours visually popping are those explosions and even the sky and sand looks amazing while the score is moving and spot on combine the two and we get the famous australian dystopian world of mad max so mesmerizing enchanting    everything is a marvel to behold georges direction is exceptional he creates new cinematic techniques of conveying action sequence without much reliance of cliche shots the end product is very fastpaced effectively creating the sense chaos that comes with good action sequences ambitious is one word to sum this up    as the background characters yell weird monologues while others swing to and fro over the war rig commencing more and more crazy feral action the films keeps on delivering the thrills under such a unique ambience and i cant help but be captivated by every one of its key moments marvel x men dc dominate the box office nowadays but those action scenes are just for fun airport scene from ca civil war for instance the one scene everyone extols is admittedly for fan indulgence and fun fury road is alone but it is much more it is of higher quality and instead of delivering sheer fun it thrills hope that there are people like george who realizes how important these films are and continue to make more of them in the near future
Jun 1 2016,negative,as early as the opening sequence i knew this was going to be a painful cinematic experience the editing was so poorly executed the constant speeding up of frames gave the action such a cheesy feel and while the amount of reallife stunts was impressive the quality of any cgi or green screen used was terrible i could go on further about the lack of depth to the plot and storytelling but i wasted enough time watching the movie i wont waste more writing about it
Jun 1 2016,positive,94 may 2022 seen this movie a few times at this point and love it every time super intense and badass throughout love the dystopic but somewhat futuristic society it takes place in love how theyre protecting the scumbag leaders wives super fun watch
May 31 2016,positive,george miller elevates action and violence to a true art form in this remake of a classic the film is a gripping full adrenaline race across the desert of a postapocalyptic future the action sequences are mesmerizing and the work of a true master craftsman in action what is perhaps the most enthralling part of the film is the absolutely absurd story and world building miller created a fantasy world where men playing flame throwing guitars and leaping through high speed chases on pullvaults seems like a typical milk run                                                                                   the movie keeps a relentless action pace that makes all of the absurdity seem so completely ordinary which might be the real magic of this movie  this is only really possible because the action filmography set choices and music are so brilliant you cannot help but believe the insanity that plays out before you you want to believe the fiction because of the quality of the production     the movie also features some surprisingly good performances charlize theron being the real the star of the film with the titular character really only acting as her support
May 30 2016,negative,was not impressed with the remake what so ever im sorry but while i can possibly come to let go of crazy mel doing the role i just didnt really connect with any of the characters in this movie because they felt more of silhouettes of characters than every possessing any real substance in fact this was really apparent in every character in this movie as you didnt get to get to know about them really feel like you could relate to them  at least in the original movie when maxs wife was run down out in the middle of the road you felt the horror and disgust of what was going on and could sympathize with max for vengence however this movie had none of that real grit teeth clenching moments where you could identify with any character  furthermore it just pained me to see how secondary they max himself  when he was what all of em were every about no longer was he intelligent and cunning he just seems empty and stale like the very theme of this movie to say more it just seemed like this movie was nothing but one long ass car chase there an unbelievable dusty surroundings that looked like a back lot of any movie studio and not anything familiar to the australian outback  which brings me to the next thing i hate about this movie was just didnt feel the apocalyptic surroundings as i did with the 2 original movies and that really took me out of the movie big time to carry the backdrop of the chaos of the tone of the film it was the same reason that  beyond thunderdome in my eyes was an abomination this made it terrible because it lacked that antagonist feel of appending doom that was always lurking near to what was going around max in any other film overall this movie was nothing more than an abortion of everything i loved about mad max in the comics or in the films
May 29 2016,positive,probably the best movie of 2015 creative comic book disasters and war and violence all comes alive on screen tom hardy and charlize theron make a great onscreen duo who start off as standoff foes but turn into allies you will not be disappointed
May 28 2016,positive,97 george millers post apocalyptic franchise successfully comes back to glorious life with amazing detail to action and continuity making mad max fury road the action film weve all been waiting for
May 28 2016,positive,the story starts off slow and you feel a little bit confused because your thrown into a situation you know nothing about the lead actor doesnt really talk a lot so the narrative is a bit confusing however the action special effects and the visuals are excellent overall its a good action movie
May 27 2016,positive,excellent action movie perhaps the best ive seen in years i wont waste your time going into a thousand details why i loved this so ill just say i highly recommend this film also in my opinion you dont have to watch any of the previous mad max movies to enjoy this one
May 27 2016,negative,one of the worst movies ive ever seen
May 27 2016,positive,having never watched mad max i went into this movie a bit sceptical never being a fan of the post apocalyptic genre i didt know what to expect i was pleasantly surprised when the movie started kicking off i was at the edge of my seat and you can imagine why the stunts were absolutely mind boggling you feel as if a lot of the stuns are done on screen and not just cgied into the movie i was absolutely captivated and even the makeup and costumes really sold it for me i really did feel as if the world went to hell and youve gotta fight for whatevers left the set pieces and music set the tone for the whole movie telling you that youre in for one hell of a ride     i wasnt too sold on the story though i would actually say that its kinda ridiculous but you cant go into a movie like this expecting amazing story and in no way did any of the trailers or promotional items made me feel that way that being said i loved furiosas character i really think that there should be more female roles like that but i wish the same could be said for max i really wast clear as to why he was doing the things he was doing he has random flashes of memories but i couldnt help but walk out thinking about it maybe it was cause i didnt watch the original movie but im just nit picking at this point     the action and stunts along with setting the tone and just plain crazy scenes is where this movie shines just dont expect the most logical reason as to why everythings happening
May 27 2016,positive,there and back again a mutes tale
May 26 2016,positive,well that movie came out of nowhere   great film really surprised me
May 23 2016,positive,was alright  could have been better
May 23 2016,positive,when the denizens of the apocalypse thunder up in their firebelching steel monstrosities raving and drooling invading the scrap of wasted earth youve dug into for shelter from the wind screaming insanities and blasphemies youll know who to thank dr george miller now 70 the director who one learns indeed finished his residency before fully succumbing to the dubious life of movie making is one of the unacknowledged architects of the 21st century or at least its most grandiose obsession  the end of the society millers postapocalypse vision has proven a cultural influence as seminal as george romeros the night of the living dead and its unleashing of the zombie fixation that still flourishes without sign of a cure millers second film in the the mad max seriesthe road warrior starring the thenuntarnished and astonishing beauty of young mel gibson was in 1980 the excelerant to the letitallburn frustrations of disenfranchised youths everywhere millers genius beyond plumbing the arid roads of aussie outback ala leone as his revisionist western wasteland ridden by monster trucks was to populate his tale of society in its last stages of entropy with mutated punks and steroidripped glam rockers in glorious leather and chainmail a product of the energycrisis era he distilled the lifeblood of the humanity down to precious drops of high octane fought and died for to be fed reverently into big daddy ed roth hot rods that roared in the dust sustaining and taking life while spewing flame like pyres lit to moloch millers was a wholly original vision  a ripping postapolcalyptic yarn that tapped into sex pistols anarchy and stoked mohawked youths ambitions to be lastrockersonearth as a seer of things to come time has revealed the acuity of millers dystovision as matched only by steampunk grandaddy hg welles and technoparanoia of orwell todays apocalpyse fashionistas pierced tribally tattooed and encyclopediciallyversed in automatic weapons from their endless practice at survivalist video games are the spawn of good dr millers vision and when the power plants grind to a halt and the mayhem begins he may even be cursed for his mad tetralogy of the road being the source a selffulling prophesy
May 23 2016,neutral,not too impressed but i am not typically impressed by so called blockbusters one of the most overrated recent movies in my opinion
May 22 2016,negative,make me wish that whatever calamity tipped the world into the postapocalyptic phase had been even more effective insufferable in that grinding inane kind of way
May 22 2016,positive,what i thought would be a crappy movie actually turned out to be one of the years best movies
May 22 2016,positive,an action genre masterpiece 2 hours of testosterone explosions and frenziness
May 22 2016,positive,nice visuals max was a bit stiff in this one
May 22 2016,positive,i really like this movie one long car chase with original characters reminds me of the original
May 21 2016,positive,i dont know how three films in the same franchise can be considered masterpieces but the mad max series pulls it off    mad max fury road isnt just one of the greatest action movies ever made its one of the greatest movies ever made period
May 21 2016,positive,a really fun movie but i really wished if their where more dialogues
May 21 2016,positive,you know hope is a mistake if you cant fix whats broken youll uh youll go insane  max rockatansky
May 21 2016,positive,speaking as someone who dug the original the hardest this is fairly close when i saw george millers name just now  then i knew  its the real deal i can see how everyone is going to love this and i do too  for some reason it always makes me and mine want to move to australia but in this case my daughters really got into this one on account of the ancient biker lady with the sewing pouch full of what you thought i was going to spoil it for someone anyway they were likemom thats you which was both an insult and a compliment
May 21 2016,positive,serving as a huge inspiration for countless postapocalyptic tales the mad max series was the original progenitor of the merciless wasteland setting in the eighties since then it seemed that mel gibson warner bros and director george miller had left the series for good after three decades of absence mad max makes his thunderous return to the silver screen and the result is one incredibly enjoyable action flick    mad max fury road pursues a simplistic yet engaging plotline which feels very distant from the previous films in the series the world is little more than an endless wasteland with numerous bandit clans warring over the precious oil and water needed to sustain life while being held captive by the war boys max tom hardy seizes his chance to escape when war rig driver imperator furiosa charlize theron defies the clans leader immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne to get a group of wives who were specifically selected by joe for breeding to safety and possibly find a new home from here the tightlipped max forms a shaky alliance with furiosa and its full speed ahead across the wastes with joe and other factions in hot pursuit if you were expecting some action that the series is known for then fury road delivers in spades and then some the film barrels along at top speed only pausing to deliver a few moments of drama as the characters attempt to find a new home its complete madness yet ironically this kind of plot is a perfect fit for both the ravaged setting and the characters that inhabit it despite not learning too much about how the wasteland came to be it is still bursting with character and the psychotic clans go a long way towards selling the films patented style which has been missing from the silver screen for so long    the characters of mad max fury may feel a little lacking at first theyre certainly far less outspoken than your usual action heroes but then you realise that the casting forms a tight parallel with the overall setting if youre new to the series you may be surprised that both max and furiosa are fairly quiet and sane when compared to the raving lunatics that populate the gangs of the wastes when theron and hardy do have lines they are delivered with the gruffness and seriousness you would expect from characters forced to survive in a world like this theron in particular makes her presence felt as a strong willed and determined heroine who often steals the spotlight from max over the course of the film the quiet protagonists contrast against the war boys who are characterised by rambling jargon mixed with peculiar religious undertones that give hints and clues about the nature of their clan often times theres a wild range of facial expressions on the actors faces that definitely put across far more than any dialogue can ultimately fury road proves that a lot can be done without dialogue which is certainly a welcome change from other films in the same genre    with a thirtyyear gap between it and its predecessors mad max fury road seizes every possible opportunity to push the boundaries of the series and the visual result is something to behold the film is absolutely stunning both from a technical and artistic standpoint imaginative car and costume designs put across the sheer chaos of the postapocalyptic desert and both of these elements interact beautifully with the computer generated sandstorms then we have the chase sequences which all utilise practical effects real stuntwork and pyrotechnics meaning that the film never loses its punch no matter how many cars get tossed and mangled onscreen fury road truly does honour its pedigree you simply wont be able to take your eyes off the screen throughout the entirety of its runtime because the film succeeds very well at making its action impactful at every turn pulsepounding sound effects and a rocking soundtrack also heighten the tension whilst the cinematography is quick clear and fluid despite the pure insanity of the action onscreen dare i say it mad max fury road could be the most technically advanced movie ever to be based in an apocalyptic setting you get the sense that the filmmakers didnt just want to bring max back but also wanted to set him apart from all other action sequences on the big screen    the postapocalyptic setting is ripe for all kinds of stories and mad max fury road is the tip of the spear by a substantial margin it revitalises and updates the series whilst not forgetting what made the previous three films such standouts strap yourselves in and get ready for one of the years best action films fury road is the most explosive and riproaring good time you will have at the cinema this summer
May 19 2016,positive,mad max fury road is possibly if not one of the best action films ever produced the directing pushed you into the action and was able to keep your attention throughout the entirety the locations and acting worked hand in hand with this apocalyptic action movie definitely a fresh movie
May 17 2016,positive,very good action 
May 15 2016,positive,mad max fury road is a dazzling film that is a truly wild ride but in the end i was a little nonplussed the fourth in the franchise is again set in a post apocalyptic world where water and oil are scarce and humanity is raging a war against itself the protagonist max is captured by the war boys and after much fighting escapes and eventually joins forces with imperator furiosa i could mention more of the plot but there is hardly any just lots and lots of fast driving and oodles of fighting but it is spectacular to look at the cinematography is sublime and the imagination of the film is writ large so it makes for a cinematic blast but in the end i just really didnt care im probably not the target audience for such a film i prefer my post apocalyptic films to be more like the road than this film as dazzling as it is
May 15 2016,positive,i never liked the original series but this was something else
May 14 2016,positive,this is a movie     mad max cannot be the definition of anything because it is beyond so many simple categories i may seem somewhat biased in this review but i dont give a shit i love this movie there are brief moments that hint at the scifi world that this masterpiece exists in the action sequences are beautifully realistic with the rust and haze of the post apocalyptic wasteland the characters are strong and charismatic drawing us into this seemingly impossible world the concepts are insane and wonderful and suddenlymos eisley seems like everyday life i could speak endlessly about how much i love this movie without stating a single flaw because to be frank there are pretty much none
May 14 2016,positive,mad max fury road is the new steppingstone of action movies after the dar knight i thought the action movies genre is dead once again at warner bros proves us wrong george miller is a magnificent masterpiece by making this wonderful crazy work of picasso here are the few steppingstones raiders of the lost ark diehard terminator two judgment day the matrix the dark knight and now mad max fury road this movie was incredible to see i am very proud of you one of these people to witness this internal glory and i promise to take you to the gates of valhalla great film to witness go see it     i saw one this when i first came out sorry for the late review     grade   a perfect 10
May 11 2016,positive,action packed throughout with a smooth running story makes mad maxfury road a crowd pleasing summer blockbuster
May 11 2016,positive,good lord what the hell just happened
May 9 2016,positive,calling this movie one of the greatest action movies ever made is selling it just a bit too short its one of the greatest movies ever made period    a masterpiece with never a dull moment george miller has the highest point so far in his career with this astonishing movie    tom hardy as the iconic max rockatansky and charlize theron as imperator furiosa star in this escort mission of epic proportions    easily among the greatest action movies ever made fury road ranks with die hard the bourne ultimatum and lethal weapon ii as one of the greats
May 8 2016,negative,great visuals but being a fan of the original mad max i was very deluded by the movie too much chase and action go see the original mad max and feel the pain of a family destroyed the need for vengeance in an empty and destroyed world where there is no law in this movie i found a lot of beautiful visuals but they were so exaggerated as to look ridicolous monkey bikes throwing nades on the truck no splinters killing people inside a truckload of dust into the engine and not even a cough while the previous movies of the franchise had a lot of visual chaos too it was interwoven with tranquil scenes with many dialogues things that conveyed the story and every new movie was connected to the previous by something the car the shotgun etc and it connected with other movies of the same theme too this one only connects with itself and in the end just seems a casual excuse for a chase movie i vastly prefer the transporter franchise or fast and furious if i want to see a chase
May 8 2016,positive,did anyone else notice that all the good girls ride airheads
May 7 2016,positive,with incredible action scenes that will undoubtedly stand the test of time intriguing characters and a handful of fantastic performances mad max fury road is an amazing visual experience and a very well made film
May 5 2016,positive,this movie surprised me a whole lot great filmmaking by george miller lot of intense action sequences great performance by charlize theron
May 5 2016,positive,this time you can believe the hype fury road is one of the most brutal and bonecrunching action films in recent memory one of the boldest most original experiences of the year and probably one of the smartest works of dystopian scifi to emerge from the current deluge of the same
May 4 2016,positive,perfect in every way fury road achieves a kind of glory that other films can only aspire to 
May 1 2016,negative,good effects good camera and all but its just a really bad movie in my opinion
Apr 30 2016,positive,amazing incredible awesome action movie like weve never seen before great visual effects and great action sequences acting is spot on
Apr 29 2016,positive,fun yet intense action movie the filters made the film look cheap and were unnecessary definitely watch this film
Apr 28 2016,positive,i didnt know what to expect coming into this movie i had no idea what the story was the beginning had me worried that it would be a little too scifi for my liking but this movie turned out pretty good the fight scenes are insane and they are continuous there is almost no down time whatsoever i do think max and furiosas crew being outnumbered so many times should have somehow created more problems for them but hey thats movies and thats what you come to expect a lot of cool detail went into this movie and it had me on the edge of my seat for the most part i did not expect to give it more than 3 stars coming in because this is not typically my type of movie go figured
Apr 27 2016,positive,awesome loved the action loved the car chases camera work made me a little dizzy but who cares really i recommend this to action movie fans
Apr 27 2016,positive,a big budget lots of fast vehicles getting wrecked a few explosions but wheres the script the only bit of film that required any characters to come alive were those scenes after finding a naked woman up the abandoned electrical tower    this reboot depends on the original films to hint at most of the backstories so make sure to watch them first otherwise this film is mostly a collection of third unit shots
Apr 27 2016,positive,the good  an amazing action movie that utilizes mindblowing practical effects furiosa is most definitely a standout great theme    the notsogood  this movie actually only have one very simple plot the titular character max is pretty much the one without any personal arc and is constantly being eclipsed by the other cast
Apr 26 2016,positive,while i agree with hunterjt13 and others about the weakness of this movie i have to begin with the caveat that i really enjoyed watching mad max fury road  i enjoyed the mayhem the big world depicted the overthetop characters i even enjoyed what charlize theron and tom hardy did with the characters they were depicting  if the movie is a commentary on modern society or if the movie is a critique of sex slavery or if the movie is a deep philosophic expose of the need to face our demons ill leave to other critics  i give the movie many stars because it is exactly what i anticipated it to be namely a ballsout nonstop fortissimo idiotshow of eyebending bone crunching violence and shit blowing up  there is little reason to ask for more in our day and age    that being said the larger commentary on this video is parallel to the comments i made on jurassic world seen in the same evening as this film a staggering amount of violence and a puerile plot  as ive already commented on the violence bit in the review of world this one receives the juvenile commentary    what happened to plot in cinema  even action films in days of yore had a cohesive and somewhat interesting plot most of the time  the ones that did not the grindhouse cinema movies of the 1970s et alia received little praise and rightfully so  but this movie has a frickin 97 rating from critics and 86 from the hoi poloi    movies are not just for entertainment but are a medium to tell stories and when the story is thin the other flaws are magnified and no amount of michael baying the explosions revving up the video ramping or adding extra red dye to the blood bags can improve that weakness    in fury road the plot is this escape the trolls drive out with the trolls chasing turn around and drive back with the trolls chasing defeat the trolls  really  what else is there in this movie  and though i might see it again the grabbing power of that plot is so weak that i would just as soon crack open a beer and watch the crows attack my garbage cans  sure there were some neat explosions some guys on long poles doing maniacal things a dwarf attached to an oxygen machine some sexy chicks getting run over by tractors what else like i said do you need in a movie amiright  but there was also a guitarplaying fella with no face strapped to one of the trollcars who played vamp music the entire time  who auditioned for that coveted job  and when he auditioned why didnt he learn more than two frickin chords  were the judge trolls like uhhh that guy   the soundtrack was like barracuda without all the nuance  and on meth  and all the deaths heads c that covered everything cars walls ceilings of cars necks rock walls tires on cars grills of cars cod pieces  what was there some company like deaths heads c incorporated saying we got you covered oh great homunculus sir when the chief troll demanded a deaths head c codpiece to adorn his groin   and how did these nubile creatures like miss kravitz miss keough and miss huntingtonwhitely stay so pristine and lavendersmelling in the midst of this dusty brutal overheated world  after a long chase wouldnt they start smelling like everyone else and the ridiculous names imperator furiosa  people eater corpus collossus  rictus erectus  hell  it sounds like something out of spinal tap or loaded diper  might as well have had a character named biggus dickus  none of this would have been problematic but that the story itself was a load of government cheese enjoyable tasty but utterly worthless in the long run  maybe thats my main beef with the beefcake in this film  the whole thing seems like it was written directed produced by some testosteronefoaming 12 year old boy who wanted to see how much he could mash up women tear out fetuses from the stomachs of their mothers explode drugcrazed rockpunk psychopaths maim old people depict fat women hooked up to milking machines portray anemic albinos hooked up to human blood bags or explode vehicles in spectacular fashions  it is two hours of fortississimo violence noise revving engines vamping guitars ramping cameras and sand  without an ounce of story    but if you like that sort of thing  give it four stars out of five as i have so done  there is little reason to ask for more in our day and age
Apr 25 2016,negative,i know seems weird i just dont liek this movie at all
Apr 24 2016,positive,nonstop insane action
Apr 24 2016,negative,uhwowthis movie seems to be trying to start a franchisenot my thing at allit does go on and onand ironically it basically gets you back to where it startedglad i didnt see it in the theatre  lots of show and no real go  in desperate need of a story
Apr 24 2016,positive,mad max fury road contains complex practical action while maintaining the thrill of a good action movie and what sets it apart from so many others is that it never lets up and never feels like it needs to
Apr 24 2016,positive,well this was totally unexpected  i did expect this movie to be great  okay at best if i am being honest  the development hell this movie went through was pretty crazy  but they definitely outdid themselves crafting a film better than any mad max that came before it arguably  charlize theron is also a real standout and honestly probably should have received a supporting actress nomination  well anyway it was pretty nice seeing an action masterpiece nominated for best picture
Apr 24 2016,positive,fast and furious this update of george millers signature apocalyptic franchise is an explosive yet poetic visual and sensual treat choosing practical effects over computergenerated ones and minimal dialogue over a busy plot this is instantly an action classic for many generations of audience to come
Apr 24 2016,positive,loud completly crazy and beautiful shot george millers mad max fury road is one of the best action movies of this decade
Apr 23 2016,positive,i liked it a lot good action good story and great stunts
Apr 23 2016,positive,a damn wild ride that will leave you drooling everything from the production design to the beautiful camerawork makes you feel engulfed in this postapocalyptic wasteland
Apr 22 2016,positive,this movie edged tom hardy to my all time favorite actors list
Apr 22 2016,positive,i think this film is destined to become a cult
Apr 21 2016,positive,i have watched this movie three times in a week and a half  it is amazing and i love the action sounds actors its amazing and i would love to see another one  i watched the older ones because i remembered watching mad max beyond thunderdome when i was younger but they are nothing compared to this one  i cant wait for another mad max movie  truly amazing
Apr 21 2016,positive,awesome  the action is exciting   the design and theme is emercive   and the stuns are incredible   my only problem is the characters   they are not really that interesting   hell i cant even remember there names besides maxs
Apr 20 2016,positive,the best action movie in decades that being said action is not all this movie has going for it it actually has a surprising amount of feeling to it with charlize therons character    tom hardy took over the max rockatansky role is great and really surprised me for a person who had never previously seen a mad max film i was so happy with how this movie turned out
Apr 19 2016,positive,really good action weighed down by one of the dumbest movie plots of this decade i am a fan of action but i require at least a somewhat decent story the whole movie was an impractical car chase the plot holes coupled with an extremely annoying jar jar binks like character  bungee guitar player whose sole purpose is to play music in one of the cars involved in the chase ruin the movie for me no idea why this movie is so highly spoken of this is the most overrated movie of all time i like the original mad max but the movies following were stupid too damn many academy awards this movie cheated out the force awakens the martian and straight outta compton more deserving films
Apr 18 2016,positive,this movie redeems every bad action film ive ever seen it is amazing
Apr 17 2016,negative,pretty horrible movie mad max is basically just a glorified taxi driver this movie isnt even about mad max i felt ripped off when i watched it also all the women in it are sour bitter hateful feminists very unpleasant movie for mad max fans
Apr 17 2016,positive,mad max is back and yes its a lovely day
Apr 16 2016,positive,good flick but but not the best scifi movie ever
Apr 16 2016,positive,a rush from start to finish
Apr 16 2016,positive,max max fury road was a masterpiece i give it 45 stars because it wasnt really my type of movie
Apr 16 2016,positive,the perfect actionmovie of 2015 and one of my absolute favorites over all
Apr 16 2016,positive,this might be the best movie i have ever seen
Apr 15 2016,positive,was good but does not live up to the hype     tom hardy was not right for this movie  in my honest opinion almost anyone else including a woman playing the role would have been better imho
Apr 15 2016,positive,mad max fury road has kept my eyes wide open the whole time making me feel excited and dazzled with the pictures beauty it is definitely one of my favorite movies now and one of the movies ill watch thousand times
Apr 15 2016,negative,this was quite possibly the worst movie ive seen in years i have no idea how it got such good reviews despite impressive cg i witnessed no redeemable qualities worth noting
Apr 15 2016,negative,this movie would have been much better had it not been called mad max it totally ruins the mad max film series  by calling it a mad max film the led me to have some high expectationsthey failed had it been just furry road with out the max character i would have given it 3 stars
Apr 15 2016,positive,maybe it lacks a proper character development some plot hole a simple script the whole movie is a major chase scene but who cares its pretty entertaining nicely directed unique and memorable characters fascinating cars fortunately not too much cgi and tons of real action
Apr 14 2016,positive,didnt really see where all the hype was coming from this was the only mad max movie ive seen and although it was pretty entertaining it failed to persuade me to watch any of the others 65 out of 100
Apr 14 2016,negative,a movie so bad i stopped watching it after 30 minutes
Apr 13 2016,positive,it very impresive how so little dialog can build such an impressive world   despite of being a full action film in a chaotic post apocalyptic world the movie is not chaotic at all miller was able to guide you through this world and tell an impresive viceral story which resembles more a myth than an action film
Apr 13 2016,negative,how can a movie with so much potential be so boring synopsis chased by bad guys truck breaks down continue chase and repeat pointless and yawn inducing
Apr 12 2016,positive,this is the craziest out of the mind  most action packed insert whatever adjective that means madness here movie that i had ever watched you also can call it a brain massage a visual feastor an 1 hour plus of action feast a enjoyable and satisfying experience for action movie fans  oh what a day what a lovely day
Apr 12 2016,positive,awesome car chasing action movie violent sexy and so much fun to watch highlights all the time
Apr 11 2016,positive,to sum up mad max fury road in one sentence itd be fury road lives up to the hype and then some because fury is amazing fury road is a breathe of fresh air in a seemingly crowded over cgied mess of an action movie genre we havent seen an action movie like this since the 2008 the dark knight the design of the cars costumes and makeup are fantastic things ive never seen in a moviebe aware ive yet to watch any of the other mad max films but will definitely do so after fury road the cinematography and look of the film is gorgeous tom hardy plays a great max that has the potential to be even better in the next 2 movies he signed for but charlize theron as furiosa completely stole the show in fury road she was awesome and badass character and really is kind of an inspiration to other women to fight for their rights and what they believe in i honestly dont know why but i felt that charlize theron deserved at least an oscar nomination for her role the cherry on top out of all of this is the biggest reason why fury road is getting all the praise it deserves the use of practical effects and real stunts little did i know that after watching fury road did i find out that most of this movie does not have any cgi its incredible especially for an action movie as big as this which is why i emphasized why fury road is the king of the action movie genre because it   stands out from normal cgi filled action movies george miller yet again created an action movie masterpiece that deserved his oscar nomination all in all mad max fury road is a masterpiece on a massive scale that is more than worthy of its 10 oscar nominations and its 6 wins i dont think anything will come close to the kind of production and action fury road has done mad max the wasteland cant come soon enough
Apr 11 2016,positive,this movie attempts to be one thing and it accomplishes that it is beautiful and exciting  from beginning to end it also receives five stars for rewatch ability
Apr 11 2016,neutral,story probably written by 8 year old
Apr 11 2016,positive,i didnt know what to expect it was good the set costume and makeup was amazing
Apr 10 2016,positive,so exciting and actionpacked
Apr 10 2016,negative,i could not get past the idea that all the mechanical devices work perfectly and never run out of fuel inspite of not having the industrial base to support them lots of unnecessary gruesomeness and unexplained weirdness that did nothing to advance the story
Apr 10 2016,negative,worst movie ever dont watch
Apr 9 2016,positive,a masterpiece speaking of its technical achievements i am just thrilled from the very beginning till its end
Apr 8 2016,positive,mad max fury road advances the action movie genre from the 1980s and transforms  the greatest effects here is the intricate ballet of action movie moments woven sometimes layers deep into the long battle scenes with a wide range of emotion   if the road warrior is millers illiad mad max fury road is his aeneid
Apr 5 2016,positive,an intense car chase through the dessert this movie certainly is epic but its not oscar worthy
Apr 4 2016,negative,how did this movie get rated so highly  if youre 15 or under and like constant 5 second violent action clips continuously with little to no story line except getting to the green go for it  what a disappointment from the early first two  horrible  im glad i saw it for free  it was hard to sit through the whole debacle
Apr 4 2016,positive,the glorious nonstop action film that no one ever seems to get right anymore has returned not only that but it has arrived within a fantasticallydetailed and wellrealised world that isnt afraid to be freaky or unconventional instead it thrives on such characteristics    the cast are great even though hardy really isnt doing that much and its furiosa who comes out as the real star she may well simply oust mad max altogether and take his place as long as theron doesnt start saying the kinds of things that mel gibson does    its a giant chase movie and it has a ton of action and instantlyquotable lines and a great villain and a rich and beautiful world to explore i sound like a little boy as i try and summarise it but thats just how exciting this film is seeing it was like watching die hard for the first time as a kid the whole time i was just thinking man thats awesome its rare that a straightup action film grabs me in that way anymore     with most good action flicks i d add the usual switch your brain off and dig in line but for this one you can rest assured feel free to delve into the films meaningsocial commentarywhatever because enough care and attention has went into that that you might actually take some things away from it if you go down that route this is a smart action film that is still an action film at its core it isnt trying to make us think it just wants to entertain us and gives us some extras to go with it     everything looks real too i only saw one shot where i felt like the effects took me out of the movie one shot out of so so many of them i was looking too i was trying to catch it out but no fury road packs a real punch and you can see it right in front of you unless all of the dust gets in your eyes    whilst i clearly love this film i will say that i was somewhat disappointed with how it began to come to an end its satisfying and fair but i also found it somewhat anticlimactic and just a little too easy this film could easily have went on for another half hour without it even slightly beginning to bore due to its fast pace and constant action i think it went for a happy ending well happy in the context of its deranged world and im not sure that it had to play it quite so safe also i wasnt hugely interested in maxs flashbacks as they just didnt feel necessary with so much else going on     anyway enough talk watch it  it is glorious
Apr 4 2016,positive,very average movie with no character development great action and visuals and i can see why many younger people that unlike me who grew up with the originals thought it was great   it looked nice  score was very below par and hardy was virtually mute during the movie   it was really a movie about the female lead and just looked like a mad max movie  very disappointing
Apr 4 2016,positive,incredible visuals not sure if liked the plot still a great watch for a friday evening
Apr 3 2016,positive,review 
Apr 3 2016,negative,another critically acclaimed movie that was beyond crap
Apr 3 2016,negative,first of all no just no this is not a good movie its an over the top farce which simply cashes in on a dusty franchise without building on the character the insanity or the cunning of max rockatansky    the movies most interesting aspect is its opening where we get a taste of post apocalyptic life as max is captured inked and branded in a nightmarish city run by the evil lord immortan joe the opening scenes feature mutations deranged drug induced youths fuel guzzling engines and a people enslaved by the control of water supply in a barren desert landscape    what happens next is a very sandy two hour car chase incorporating a desert storm of biblical proportions a flame throwing guitar victoria secret virgins monster trucks and various gangs which help give pursuit to the increasing escalation of nonsense    the problem with the movie is that there is no realism not that it hurts to be removed from reality in a science fiction movie but what i mean is that the lead characters are indestructible despite several run ins with death throughout the movie for the first twenty minutes max is used as a type o blood bag without so much as receiving a cookie then he unflinchingly partakes in two hours of truck driving combat there is no connection to max or to the female lead furiosa we dont know their motives how theyve both wound up at the citadel where theyre going how they intend to survive and worse is that we dont feel any empathy for them despite the severe lacerations they receive throughout ultimately the characters are sub material to a movie that concentrates on being loud and jam packed with adolescent fantasy although the landscape is vast the movie has no depth there is no tension in the fight scenes car chases truck some meaningless extra gets killed truck gets speared car blows up repeat for two hours charge ten bucks a head release to dvd    for me the film fails to fire from both barrels its more of a max and his moths kinda movie than the rage filled road warrior epic i was expecting my only advice is if you go to see fury road dont be afraid to walk it never gets better and dont be fooled into thinking its nearly over its not just get up off your seat dont apologise to the idiot beside you kick them if you must shout abuse if appropriate just do whatever it takes to make your way to the green exit sign and go  read more reviews  
Apr 2 2016,negative,i have seen 1500 plus movies in my life this is the worst one i have ever seen in my 31 years on earth i think the reviews must be fake not to mention all the twisted metal ripoffs
Apr 2 2016,neutral,fantasy dystopian desert adventure in which the bad guys are stupid ugly and shit shots and the good guys n gals never miss plenty of old vehicles that never break down and a script that involves a lot of grunting nothing in this film makes sense and its more attractive feature is the warped surreal landscapes  though most of it looks like the atakama
Apr 2 2016,positive,best movie of 2015 definitely george miller creation keeps us awake till the end breathtaking action and road rage that miller keeps from us for so many years finally gives us back in mad franchise sequel every planed scene and desert wasteland is escape to mad adventure that you cant get out until the end of the movie vehicles and chase is portrayed with power in them and badass destruction once more hardy shows us that he is capable of doing seriously fantastic movies and giving us special performance charlize as furiousa is something special as she takes us to journey of good and mad as tolkien wrote lord of the rings universe george miller gave us mad max universe 100100
Apr 2 2016,positive,oh what a day what a lovely day
Apr 2 2016,positive,i saw the original mad max it was violent it had car battles it had minimal character development i had very realistic expectations going into the theater to see this new version    never have i been more disappointed with a movie the acting on both leads parts was mediocre at best with the male lead switching from being well spoken to being capable of nothing but grunting     the story line seems to have been written and edited by remedial english students the characters are unbelievable and seriously lack any character development it has horrible motorcycle stunts and guys bouncing back and forth on poles of all things    and come on a flamethrowing guitar and fat women being milked for no explained reason to trade for gasoline to power the flame throwing guitar its full of shitty clichés badly cut scenes and lots of explosions     save your money see anything else and you will be better off
Apr 2 2016,negative,utter rubbish omg you got this so wrong
Apr 1 2016,negative,mmfr was horrible fake looking cgi meaningless story wooden acting oh and unbelievable plot changes that you wont believe because they make no sense are these characters really this stupid
Apr 1 2016,negative,i just saw mad max fury road for the first time luckily i did not pay to do so and the company received no benefit from my watching yes the special effects and action are amazingbut it wasnt a movie there was no plot there was no character development and even a five minute introduction as they had in road warrior would have made the film more interesting total social justice warrior agenda and total garbage boycott hollywood i gave it a 1 star rating on imbd and am going to go do the same at rotten tomatoes this type of propaganda is just another example of how ideology ruins art
Apr 1 2016,positive,from beginning to end mad max fury road is a nonstop thrilling action film that manages to balance the characterization effects and direction of this chaotic dystopia in the most beautiful manner two times was the charm for me to be convinced that mad max deserved every single piece of acclamation it was getting director george miller created the most engaging fictional world with the right amount of action with the perfect cast and without never overloading the film with too many explosions or special effects    the main cast tom hardy and who would have thought charlize theron are just phenomenal and work perfectly together while the plot can easily speak on its own this wouldve never worked without the right cast it is impressive how they manage to make a mostly serious movie with extremely small hints of comedy here and there entertaining and interesting    now it is time to praise everything else sound and visual effects production design cinematography costumes makeup and hair styling seriously when i was talking about having an unexpected perfectly good balance i was not joking the sound mixing and special effects are truly remarkable bringing the movie to life and letting you in into the mayhem this world is the costume makeup and hair styling hint at everything each character is their personalities and a glimpse at some backstory there is no time to tell within the two hours and the cinematography directs you to whats important and you are able to appreciate how involved each scene is    mad max is successful because it manages to turn an insane film a chaotic film into one of the best action movies that i have ever seen mind you i am not big on action movies it is not easy to control and shape this amount of chaos and confusion into a good film at one point i had to ask myself is this really an action movie because it is so freaking good mad max is just incredibly good
Apr 1 2016,positive,the best mad max film and one of the finest most intense action films in recent memory technically impeccable with a fascinating soundtrack and photography fury road is also the bestwritten film of the series theron is very good in the role of furiosa but the most important asset is the unrelenting frenzied exhilarating and in some cases even moving action be it bigscale chases or impressive fist fights brilliantly orchestrated by miller and never running low on ideas its a triumph allaround
Apr 1 2016,positive,my second favorite film of 2015 mad max fury road doesnt bog down with exposition choosing instead to tell its story visually and what a treat the visuals are intense action and a startling attention to detail makes for a fantastic ride
Apr 1 2016,positive,spectacular action sequences but overall not really my thing
Mar 31 2016,positive,this was amazing no shaky cam and a great plot i love this movie i watched this movie 3 times probably will see more times
Mar 31 2016,positive,what a film what a lovely film    set in a world where people had finally had enough of 30 indistinguishable superhero films every summer and decided to end it all fury road is a ballstothewall punkrock masterpiece that offers an education in tone setting cinematography subtle characterisation and mindblowing action to any would be spandex loving director    the film is a blistering high speed chase through the australian outback that never once lets you catch your breath and thats really all it is except it isnt    you could count the number of lines of dialogue in this film on one hand and yet it still manages to fully flesh out every single character we know who they are and what their motivation is that is an astounding piece of storytelling the setting for the film is beautiful and miller masterfully shows us this wasteland rather than tells us about it unlike a lot of summer blockbusters this film remembers that cinema is a visual storytelling medium the action will have to go without saying because you just have to see it to believe it i lack the vocabulary to truly explain what this film does with its action scenes    5 out of 5 i honestly cant say a single bad thing about it
Mar 30 2016,positive,one of my favorite movies of 2015 for sure one of those movies you can watch multiple times and not get sick of
Mar 30 2016,neutral,this movie is a visual masterpiece the cinematography is outstanding producing a movie of this scale with all of the practical stunts and effects seems almost impossible and that is why so many people are enamored with this movie however the other half of the equation the acting writing and character development are so bad that what could have been an epic classic ends up becoming a soulless action film with no substance to speak of i wanted to love this film but it becomes very obvious that this was a sandbox for george miller 2 12 stars since it was half masterpiece and half nothing
Mar 30 2016,positive,whats makes this movie special is that it is one of those rare movies which is not shot with green background but on real location    worth a watch 
Mar 29 2016,positive,one of the best movies of this generation its stunning visuals and sounds transcend this movie onto a whole new level a great story with captivayting characters mad max fr is a smash hit that will be remembered forever in movie histroy the future of this franchise looks madly fanstatic
Mar 29 2016,negative,mad max is driven by mindless action and riddled narrative which leads to an uncompelling story
Mar 29 2016,negative,one of the most overrated movies ever its not as good as people say who praise this movie for its great structure and incredible effects i will agree its a great technical achievement but the story and the action really hit the lows at many points and you actually miss mel gibsons more believeable presence of the character of max rockatansky and its so easy to see through the very straight performance from charlize theron
Mar 29 2016,negative,tedious a two hour car chase  good special effects but that is all
Mar 28 2016,positive,the only bad thing about it is that it doesnt end quite as brilliant as it begins
Mar 28 2016,positive,the reboot is worth to watch and action lover will love this
Mar 28 2016,positive,the post apocalyptic aesthetics are on point from the wasteland settings color palette to the well designed costumes and props  the actionpacked cinematography is highenergy excitement that puts many other action movies to shame  the storyline is enough to set the stage for all the high speed action sequences that are second to none
Mar 28 2016,positive,oh what a lovely movie what a lovely movie let the huge amounts of action and explosions begin
Mar 28 2016,positive,best movie of 2015 hands down
Mar 28 2016,positive,pretty wild hang on for the ride
Mar 28 2016,neutral,adrenalyzed experience if you like it this will be a master movie great by the circus which is developed however if you are a fan of bach and haendler you will find a monstertruck fight with accelerated batteries and kilowatts of music nobody will be neutral about this movie
Mar 28 2016,positive,by far the pinnacle of the series 100 awesome
Mar 27 2016,positive,i was never a fan of the original mad max but i was surprised by fury road and how deep it actually was  the cinematography was stunning and amid the visuals there is a compelling story and characters you cant help but root for  recommended
Mar 27 2016,positive,didnt think this movie would be anything but it surprised me reviews are spot on this is good violent and insanely faced paced but flows really well and has depth
Mar 27 2016,negative,what utter tripe totally over rated load of cobblers
Mar 27 2016,negative,one of the worst films ive ever seen in the theaters
Mar 27 2016,negative,this moveir is absolute  shit what a fucking waste of 2 hours of my life  i cant believe i watched this shit it was only dur to the amount of wine i drank     cunt bolloxs shite
Mar 27 2016,positive,mad max fury road is iconic action filmmaking released in a time where cgi fx and all other bits of technological visuals have been dominating the hollywood scene director george miller proves action can still be as exhilarating unique and narratively profound through practical effects and by using action as a vessel to his overall story fury road not only demands constant attention to the small nonverbal narrative details but also requires some thought process viewers should not be surprised if theyre still finding details in their third or fourth viewing that they didnt find previouslya feat that many hollow action films shouldve aimed for tom hardy gives a superb performance in a role mel gibson left behind but it is charlize therons imperator furiosa that steals the screen and our hearts as one of the more memorable characters in any mad max film for those who havent previously seen a mad max film i would definitely encourage them to check out the first andor second film but fury road can be watched and mostly understood on its own
Mar 26 2016,negative,i have to disagree with the ratings on this one didnt like this one at all too much car chasing too much sand lass fun i even like the one with tina tuner more than this
Mar 26 2016,positive,how could it be anything less a sodding adrenaline sodden masterpiece of non stop rarrrness
Mar 26 2016,positive,madmax is a masterpiece with tom hardy in the role this movie is a great movie of 2015 it could be the best 2015 movie to me with great action cars blowing up and awesome fights this movie is a must see one the best movies ever made in my life time 1010
Mar 26 2016,positive,omg i really wasnt expect it to be so good but it really is  one of the best action movies ever the make up the sound the design everything
Mar 26 2016,negative,rubbish it was one big open road no character development attachment or structure feels like everyone liked it because they were meant to lacks substance
Mar 25 2016,positive,the best movie of 2015 george miller toke everything from an action and adventure movie and turned it into a masterpiece
Mar 25 2016,negative,complete trash dont waste your time with this movie
Mar 25 2016,neutral,just horrible its over hyped i wanted to like this movie i really did but the movie couldnt keep my attention for much long maybe because of the horrible acting of the supporting casts or the much worse story itself but luckily i got through it the only reason i am giving it even a 2 is because of the action scenes which werent that bad and because of how well charlize and tom performed their roles in the movie
Mar 25 2016,positive,full adrenaline from the beginning to the end tom hardy and charlize theron are badass
Mar 25 2016,positive,wow what an accomplishment they made with the movie fantastic set pieces amazing practical effects and good yet funny performances didnt think old movies could get good sequels anymore but this proved me wrong
Mar 25 2016,positive,mad max delivers as an action movie but those calling it an instant classic need to calm down mad max is a visually imaginative pulsepounding spectacle but it certainly has none of the subtle all time great acting performances that made films like the godfather true film classics that appeal to nearly everyone mad max is unique enough to set itself apart from the usual action flick but the story isnt that great
Mar 25 2016,positive,not much of a story but there doesnt need to be this is a fun ride from start to finish
Mar 25 2016,positive,a dirty bloody masterpiece mad max fury road is a breathe of fresh air into the seemingly lackluster time for action movies bringing back practical effects and real explosions instead of using fake unrealistic cgi which the movie uses very little of tom hardy was solid as mad max in the film showing potential to be great in his next two installments of mad max films he signed for in the end i dont see any action movie topping fury road for a long timeexcept for maybe mad max the wasteland
Mar 24 2016,negative,i walked out so boring
Mar 24 2016,positive,george miller has created such a rich beautiful looking world which is vibrant and chaotic tom hardy takes over from mel gibson seamlessly the future is bright and wide open for this franchise cant wait for more
Mar 24 2016,positive,for me this was the film of the year
Mar 23 2016,positive,best movie of 2015 dont listen to the oscars baftas or whatever fury road is like a banquette for your eyes
Mar 23 2016,neutral,just not my kind of movie i knew it wasnt when i saw the trailers so i didnt see it in theaters but after it won all the oscars in 2016 hyperbole i know i decided to give it a shot its technically beautiful shot very well and is one of the best examples of seamlessly marrying practical and visual effects to enhance what was filmed in camera and the performances from charlize theron tom hardy and the rest of the supporting cast are very strong but the overthetop character design and some of the gloomier element of the story just arent my bag
Mar 23 2016,positive,its the closest thing to a perfect movie ive ever seen
Mar 23 2016,positive,a modern day masterpiece    1010
Mar 22 2016,positive,a pleasant madness an amazing action movie
Mar 22 2016,positive,i dont get the huge ratings it was basically one big car chase and that was it
Mar 22 2016,positive,utilising the most amount of practical action seen in cinema for years this expertly crafted piece of death and destruction makes every summer blockbuster today seem tame in comparison i guess you could say they were all mediocre    a
Mar 21 2016,positive,fantastic photography a new standard has been set
Mar 20 2016,negative,more like a video game script than a movie
Mar 20 2016,positive,apparently it takes an old veteran like george miller to show this new generation of young filmmakers how action can be exhilarating and so he gives us this highoctane adrenalinefueled roller coaster of a movie that is technically flawless visually astonishing and looks amazing in 3d
Mar 19 2016,negative,heres the synopsis race across the desert being chased by bad guys only to find out where you were going isnt there so go back from whence you came kill all the rest of the bad guys world peace restored two hours of my life i wont get back this won oscars for technical merit i guess yawn
Mar 19 2016,negative,this is a total piece of cinematic waste  such a stupid movie an insult to intelligence puerile  a videodrome of special effects and ridiculously crafted machines  leave your brain behind
Mar 18 2016,positive,the cast in this film were amazing and george miller never disappoints with his world of mad max which is still relevant in the 21st century
Mar 18 2016,negative,a strange movie  i only watched it to see why people thought this was the best 2015 movie  but i wasnt impressed   i must be in the minority  it had tons of action but a strange movie with a lot of disturbing characters
Mar 18 2016,negative,great visuals but its overrated
Mar 17 2016,positive,great special effects and chase scenes but lacking in story and involvment in characters hugh keays bryne does a great job as does charlize theron and war boy but apart from that some inside to the characters and story would have made a break from the endless car chase scenes
Mar 17 2016,negative,what plot  men ruin the world and max is a blundering moron who ouldnt hold his own dick while pissing  enter balded theron to get him through those hard parts  havent walked out of a film since matrix reloaded
Mar 16 2016,positive,i thought this was a very well made movie and the oscars agree and the only thing wrong with it imo was that it was odd and confusing at times
Mar 15 2016,negative,there is a danger to post apocolyptic movies  the future is so bleak there is nothing to fight for and therefore no tension  after about an hour and  i gave up hope and fell asleep  never has so much action made me sleep so soundly
Mar 15 2016,positive,mad max fury road is a great action movie and when you add in charlize theron as furiosa it becomes even better the practical effects are second to none and provide a great spectacle for the audience however the story is certainly lacking and tom hardy doesnt have to do anything apart from stunts the movie is definitely a fun time but its essentially a ninety minute long car chase i understand why others love it but the lack of plot made me less interested in the characters taking me out of the experience
Mar 14 2016,positive,one of the best uses of colour ive ever seen in film and simply the most fully realized universe ive been sucked into in quite some years just an incredibly kinetic film always moving with wonderful performances i know some people are lambasting the story but i found it a relief to show a movie that presented a narrative without ever getting bogged down in exposition there is definitely a narrative simple as it may be part of me wishes it was just a smidge shorter but overall definitely one of the most impressive blockbusters to come along in quite some time
Mar 14 2016,negative,this is a very idiotic movie that fails in every respect screenplay casting direction editing  retards who confuse preplayed video games with quality filmmaking apparently cant tell the difference between this and the original road warrior
Mar 14 2016,positive,destined to be a modern classic mad max fury road provides mind blowing and refreshingly sensational action sequences but also has a strong narrative injecting some humanity into the film
Mar 14 2016,positive,two very long car chases shot beautifully but did not live up to the hype hardy said like 8 words
Mar 13 2016,positive,better than i thought it was going to be
Mar 13 2016,negative,technically superb  imaginative setting and characters  but wow what a drab story line  roles were gradeschool shallow  acting wasnt required  overthetop war carnage was hollywood trademarked meaning of course the heroes survive anything but dismemberment  in all could have been just as impressive as a 15 minute film without wasting an hour plus of ones life
Mar 13 2016,negative,this movie was terrible why do people like it
Mar 13 2016,positive,i wasnt expecting to like this one bit as i hated the original greatly surprised action from start to finish and i couldnt get enough
Mar 12 2016,positive,simple story line fancy movie
Mar 12 2016,negative,this film makes it clear that the oscar committee as well as the rotten tomatoes critics can be bought this is literally the worst movie i have ever seen it makes waterworld look like the godfather it made jason x look like shindlers list i might actually be dumber for having watched this movie i only finished it all the way through because of how hilariously bad it was which allowed me to put on my own mystery science theater 3000 right in my very own home    i would definitely recommend this film to anyone who enjoys satiring terrible films that lack any substance or depth
Mar 12 2016,positive,just because a film is filled with explosions doesnt mean it is the best action film ever pretty good film though barely any max in it though
Mar 12 2016,positive,being a 2hour action sequence means that mad max has the ability to both captivate and bore
Mar 12 2016,positive,the film is a visual roller coaster thanks to the extreme creative genius of the technical crew in crafting a stimulating feast for the eyes that the characters inhabit throughout this postapocalyptic story however it is the story that is the personal drawback for me in the movie with my failure to become invested enough in the characters or at times it seemed the thinlystretched story across the twohour runtime nevertheless george miller brings a refreshing invigoration to his directing that is extremely admirable and impressive
Mar 12 2016,negative,visually compelling great action but missing a story  this action packed extraordinarily filmed movie is a bit of a guilty pleasure but if you are looking for any resemblance of a coherent plot line then you will want to pass this one up  i couldnt believe this was nominated for best picture  i will add that the oscars won by this picture were well deserved film editing check to make what little story line out of the little actual plot line equals oscar to me  i saw this movie in 3d which added to the impact of the nonstop action which makes this a must see for teen age boys who can talk their mom and dad into letting them watch an r rated movie  if you are looking for something with a story that will peak your intellect pass this up if you want nonsensical action without a cohesive plot this is may be for you
Mar 11 2016,positive,awesome animation altogether a nice movie
Mar 10 2016,positive,tom hardy and charlize theronnon stop action
Mar 10 2016,negative,horroble boring movie
Mar 10 2016,positive,mad max is a visually stunning masterpiece of the action genre filled with fantastic practical effects and badass vehicle designs while the story is a bit simple it doesnt take away the fact that mad max fury road is a heartpounding thrillride of a film with every viewing adding more appreciation to a film like this being created in a time of very bland action movies
Mar 10 2016,positive,visually stunning grande and so over the top its great
Mar 10 2016,positive,the best movie of 2015  the cinematography picture and the theme behind it makes this the best movie by george miller
Mar 9 2016,positive,one of the best caraction movies ive seen reminded me a lot of borderlands
Mar 9 2016,positive,incredible action but not enough dialogue and story for me
Mar 8 2016,positive,this film is a well executed thrillride that is short on dialogue but not on substance love it so much the characters and images are unforgettable
Mar 7 2016,positive,this is how you do nonstop action
Mar 7 2016,negative,the movie had hardly any plot for the first half of the movie the rest of it wasnt that great either i liked the original mad max movies but this one just wasnt that great stunned that it won awards
Mar 7 2016,positive,holy mother of god everything else just became mediocre
Mar 7 2016,positive,it was wild and boolin
Mar 7 2016,positive,absolutely the best film of 2015 the whole thing was masterfully put together the action was stunning and brutal you really did have a feeling that this kind of world was possible too maybe not to the extent of the madness that we saw in this but the base of the world seemed very real the 6 oscars were very well deserved
Mar 7 2016,positive,george miller  oh my god  another masterpiece  great effects  great actors  great storyline  1010
Mar 6 2016,positive,strong really strong stuning ridiculous but is all you might want from and action movie and even more the fury road is open
Mar 6 2016,negative,this is the most overrated film i have ever seen sure the visuals are amazing but that doesnt make up for an overall crappy movie
Mar 6 2016,positive,im not a fan of the mad max franchise but fury road was excellent  mad max fury road has a decent story albeit with plot holes aplenty and interesting characters with marvelous costume makeup and special effects  its truly spectacular
Mar 6 2016,neutral,it wasnt bad i wish the end was more satisfying i have some gripes about it for sure and despite what just about everyone said i do think it helps to have seen the originals
Mar 6 2016,negative,most wtf movie of 2015
Mar 6 2016,positive,this was batshit crazy entertaining action just not sure what the hell happened
Mar 6 2016,positive,one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life
Mar 6 2016,positive,a fast paced delight
Mar 6 2016,positive,very entertaining and action packed the stunts and vissuals are top notch
Mar 6 2016,positive,great movie from start to finish there is never a dull moment this is a movie you can watch many times and still get entertained each time
Mar 6 2016,positive,excellent acting and suspense mad max is great showcase of action charlize theron and practical effects
Mar 6 2016,negative,eh  i still think the road warrior was the best one
Mar 6 2016,positive,after watching mad max i felt i had been on a 30 mile forced march  its action packed sometimes silly but i think it deserved most of the awards it won  it was  a creative masterpiece
Mar 6 2016,positive,completely bonkers didnt really understand what was going on but worth a watch
Mar 6 2016,positive,so baffled by all the critical love this film got    i mean it was fairly fun but it was also mind blowingly stupid and populated with pretty lifeless characters who didnt really develop at all    kind of like baz lurhman collaborating with michael bay    it was cool that it had lots of badass women and the visuals were pretty stunning but these things do not a great film make
Mar 6 2016,negative,husband who is a fan of mad max the original said give it time and it will improve  gave it 20 mins he fell asleep and i just got mad no plot no dialogue just a bloody long car chase
Mar 5 2016,positive,sublime tense original and fully packed of action mad max fury road rises the name to the top of the holy mountain of the movies
Mar 5 2016,positive,lots of spectacular action
Mar 5 2016,negative,a two hour boring car chase undeveloped characters
Mar 5 2016,positive,visually its brilliant which is the only reason to watch keep watching it
Mar 5 2016,positive,this movie was entertaining fun and a feast for the eyes and ears from the get go charlize theron was badass
Mar 4 2016,negative,one of the worst movies ive ever seen awful
Mar 4 2016,negative,how did this movie win awards  not good
Mar 4 2016,negative,the special effects and sound were great the actual movie was awful
Mar 4 2016,positive,thirty years is a long time to wait for a new installment in a film franchise but mad max fury road overcomes this problem for a variety of reasons firstly director george miller simply doesnt care if youre familiar with whats come before hes also smart enough to forge a path down fury road that avoids reboot alley sequel street prequel avenue and remake boulevard this mad max is its own movie which is wildly refreshing even more importantly its an insane orgy of fire and carnage that contains more originality and vision in its first 15 minutes than did last years entire summer movie season    tom hardy is the new max rockatansky and were reintroduced to the road warrior just as he gets picked up by a rabid band of war boys the whiteskinned lizardlike army that worships the old tyrant immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne while max is being held as a source of blood for sickly war boys like nux nicholas hoult one of joes most loyal soldiers betrays him the imperator furiosa charlize theron absconds with joes most powerful rig and five of his most desired breeders    ive already said it but it bears repeating it doesnt matter that you dont know what this stuff means its all there and it all makes sense in the context of whats on the screen by the time max is hooked masked and strung up on the hood of nuxs vehicle we know everything we need to know about this world its inhabitants and their motivations why does furiosa have a mechanical arm doesnt matter whats the deal with all the breast milk doesnt matter why is there a guy playing a guitar that shoots flames in the midst of all this carnage doesnt fucking matter    that ballstothewall idontcarewhatyouthink style of filmmaking is cool but it also serves a purpose here it forces you to constantly stay in the moment these characters dont digress and they rarely pontificate their pasts fears and hopes will sometimes define their choices and actionslike furiosas decision to take the women away from joebut they arent things that need to be discussed and debated the thing theyre most concerned about is survival and the thing theyre secondmost concerned about doesnt exist that stateofmind is not just apparent but tangible in every sweet frame of this movie    and the actors convey this stateofmind perfectly neither tom hardy nor charlize theron says much over the course of the film but they dont need to theyre two of the finest actors of their generationcapable of relaying more with a look than could any amount of words with this film tom hardy reclaims the title of best male actor from joaquin phoenix in my mind but well see what irrational man brings later this summer in their eyes are a lifetime of pain and exhaustion but theres also a fire and a fight that burns as brightly as any explosion we see over the films two hours    and there are a lot of explosions a lot of fire in mad max fury road on millers monochromatic desert backdrop it looks amazing perhaps more amazing than the blazing reds and oranges are the night scenes sumptuous blues even in 3d the films colors pop spectacularly and youll be treated to some eyepopping moments especially toward the films finale you wont find a better postconversion than this lets not screw this up john seale needs an oscar nomination here    im not sure where the mad max series goes from here but i dont really care im happy that a film like this can get made today im happy that miller revived this character to tell an important story that strives to advance the cause of feminism in film hell im simply happy that there are people as creative as those behind this movie working in the industry its easy to forget that with so much disposable nonsense out there but this film refuses to go down that road and the result is something that sets the bar high not just for the summer of 2015 but for every studio every filmmaker every creator    johnlikesmoviescom
Mar 4 2016,positive,the only four words that i have said after the vision of mad max fury road are george miller is a genious   this is the best movie of 2015s cinematografic season    review from italy
Mar 4 2016,positive,mad max fury road is metal as fuck its the purest and one of the best straight action films ive seen    while the film rarely takes a breath during its two hour runtime the little snippets of characterization provide compelling reasons to root for the heroes and even sympathize with its villains also while i dont know if you could call it a feminist piece it handles a surprising wealth of female characters with incredible grace never falling prey to the genres most common failings of damseling its women or having them overcompensate with fierce masculinity in fact all the colorful characters in the film simply are they feel like effortless extensions of the mad world they inhabit even the antagonists crazed henchmen are given proper motivations for their behavior    for the full review visit 
Mar 4 2016,negative,horribly overrated nothing more than two hour pointless chase scene it might resonate with fans of the original which to be frank i didnt care for either it was better than the farce awakens
Mar 4 2016,negative,i thought this was one of the worst films ive seen for a very very long time  no real plot or story just a feature length action sequence without end which ultimately just becomes boring
Mar 3 2016,positive,rating  9810  its the most gorgeous imaginative and pyrotechnic action movie youll ever see
Mar 2 2016,positive,balls to the wall no comprise this film  in an epic way  tells a primal story without forcefeeding you the plot or the message
Mar 2 2016,positive,a madness and a hell of a movie  a must watch 1
Mar 1 2016,positive,love the actions  graphics
Mar 1 2016,positive,i bought this movie in bluray 3d and was really excited to watch it it got so many oscars and was supposedly action packed and really amazing i was pretty dissapointed there definitely isnt nonstop action there are probably only about five or six actually action scenes that range between 510 minutes granted most of the action sequences are really cool but atill i liked the kingsman church acne better than this entire movie there was some pretty good character building just not with max basically all he does in the movie is grunt i was expecting it to be a super cool action flick and was pretty dissapointed also the guitar guy is barely in the movie so i dont know why he had so much hype they could have done some really cool fighting with him the 3d added really good depth and gas a couple hinge pop out and overall was worth the extra 5 dollars we paid for it ok movie would suggest rental go see ddeadpool
Mar 1 2016,positive,second half was good
Mar 1 2016,positive,thoroughly enjoyed it it earned every oscar it got can not wait for the sequel
Mar 1 2016,positive,wow that was awesome not at all what i was expecting where can i get a car with drummers and guitarist and big huge speakers to follow me around
Mar 1 2016,positive,action packed hardy brilliant as usual  well worth a watch
Mar 1 2016,negative,did i watch a different film to everyone else this film sucked its just a big car chase with a flimsy plot around it
Mar 1 2016,positive,a group of rebellious women hook up with road man called max and all sorts of mayhem breaks loose sensational action sequences just keep on coming in this thrill a minute adventure
Mar 1 2016,positive,gritty grimy and nonstop action  its not a remake more a rebirth
Mar 1 2016,positive,if you have seen the first two  mad max and road warrior   you will appreciate fury road but not go crazy over it  it is a visual and artistic spectacle however a weak story the previous installments are more substance and less flash  fury roads script is practically nonexistent see the other two and you will appreciate how much better they are  especially when you consider how long ago they were made they did not need all the special effects to produce solid products  the one exception  beyond thunderdome is the weakest of all four
Mar 1 2016,negative,suffered through it once thought i must have missed something and tried to watch it a second time couldnt last through 15mins and then i figured i didnt miss anything just a really bad movie
Feb 29 2016,negative,dont waste your time
Feb 29 2016,positive,everything is better in this sequel the acting is better sorry mel the pacing is better the editing is tighter the action sequences are more impressive the plot is slightly more interesting and the characters are more captivating it boggles my mind however why this was nominated for best picture if the academy wanted to nominate a blockbuster action flick there were plenty of better choices the avengers jurassic world antman or my personal choice star wars this whole series is just overrated and lifeless i cant imagine wanting a repeat viewing of any of them other than this one
Feb 29 2016,positive,best action movie ever made period
Feb 29 2016,positive,mad max seems like god is multipleediting scenes like a fastpaced classical piano music as these sinful survivors take a crackpot leap of faith as if their vehiclecrazed deaths want to be a memorable sportsmanship memorial in the minds of mad max and the innocent survivors 
Feb 29 2016,positive,good but oscar worthy
Feb 29 2016,negative,that has to be one of the worst movies i had ever seen if it wasnt for the victorias secret run away from daddy bunch i would have given it 0stars
Feb 29 2016,positive,awesome film i would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a tightly packed action film with loads of special effects
Feb 29 2016,positive,though i am late on this review most people know how amazing this movie is so thats all i have to say1010 ign
Feb 29 2016,negative,worse mm ever  the mm character was a big ole wimp
Feb 29 2016,negative,worst movie of 2015 in my opinion the cinematography is pretty good but its boring to watch people drive down a dirt road for 2 and a half hours
Feb 29 2016,positive,a good solid action movie however road warrior will always be the best mad max movie in my opinion
Feb 28 2016,negative,ugh can i get that 2 hours back  i decided to watch this because of all the outstanding reviews  what a pointless and stupid movie
Feb 28 2016,positive,very good film thoroughly enjoyed it tom hardy was awesome as usual didnt have a clue what was going on or what things were but was fantastic will have to see the original films to compare
Feb 28 2016,positive,simply amazing to sit back and be taken on a wild ride by george miller  seein it 7 times  and its still thrilling
Feb 28 2016,positive,the best movie in the mad max series great acting and a great plot the action and special effects are great worthy best picture nominee
Feb 28 2016,negative,one of the most overrated films of last year its technically impressive but the lack of story and characters kill this movie and its incredibly stupid and bizarre in places but charlize theron absolutely rocks it so i cant hate it
Feb 28 2016,negative,this movie should have just been named max since tom hardy was not mad at all he should have taken lessons from the crazy old lady in the movie who was actually mad there was no char dev as in the prior mad max films either as it was one long neverending action scene           visually stunning but cast an actor who is actually australian horrible fake accent and can be crazy like mel gibson  worst mad max movie by far
Feb 28 2016,positive,wow if i had socks on while watching mad max fury road they would have been knocked clean off
Feb 28 2016,negative,no plot at all and they tried way to hard to be over the top
Feb 28 2016,neutral,i cannot believe this movie is sweeping up the oscars it was ok not good and certainly not great the best part of the movie was the cinematography the story was retread and the acting ok i actually stopped watching it half way through and finished it a month or so later on an airplane     crazy that this movie is being considered as one of the best alltime
Feb 28 2016,negative,was so glad when it was over
Feb 28 2016,negative,i am utterly amazed that this film scored so highly 97 and 86 i watched this nonsense  for just over an hour and then thought this really is a pile of tripe in my life i have hardly ever not finished watching a film because it was  wasting my time i mean probably less that ten films ever maybe maybe a dozen but this is one of them and im not that hard to please how many films have i watched well i turn 60 years old in a couple of weeks hey maybe i got out of bed the wrong side todaybut really this film is poor why well the story line is just so pathetically weak the filming stunts and action are technically top notchwhich given a bottomless pile of cash anyone could do but  really its just a great big huge massive crash bang wallop epic car chase in orange sand and rock  about as subtle and clever as being hit in the mouth with a piece of sandstone as for those that like it cue the sound of sheep braying
Feb 28 2016,positive,not much of a plot and given that i hadnt seen any of the previous films i felt lost worth watching for the effects but honestly you arent missing much otherwise
Feb 28 2016,positive,this movie impresses me with every shot automatically putting george miller as a director who absolutely knows what hes doing with a perfect blend of amazing practical effects and cgi in the storm scene which was visually impressive with great acting from tom hardy although he mostly mumbles with his bad assery shown off by his actions and expression while hes being haunted by his past with a great overall cast and amazing script with a interesting world filled with practical effects this is a movie you shouldt pass up at all
Feb 28 2016,positive,in the words of metal hammer magazine this is the most metal film of the yearwowwowsuch an enjoyable movie 2 watch with such a fantastic cast throughout this movie it is such a fantastic movie 2 watch with such a brilliant cast throughout this moviewarning this movie contains strobe lightning effects throughout some scenes throughout this movie its got such a fantastic soundtrack throughout this movie it is such a brilliant movie 2 watch with a brilliant cast throughout this movieits such an enjoyable brilliant movie 2 watch with a great cast throughout this moviewarning this movie contains strobe lightning effects throughout some scenes throughout this movieman this is such a brilliant movie 2 watch it is such a fantastic movie 2 watch it is such a brilliant enjoyable movie 2 watch with a great cast throughout this movie it is such a brilliant movie 2 watchits got fantastic fight scenes throughout this movie man this is such a great movie 2 watch with a brilliant cast throughout this movie
Feb 28 2016,positive,ive seen all four mad max movies but it is this 4th mad max fury road that got be sitting on the edge of my seat for the whole 2 hours film tom hardy and charlize therion forged a great alliance to fight eternal joe a geriatric villain who returned from mad max 1 36 years ago toe cutter the he ran over mad maxs wife and baby thirtyfive years since mad max 1 mad max 4 has reached cinematic excellence in this modern reboot in all aspects story cast visuals and music the previous 3 with mel gibson really pale in comparison although thunderdom withtina turner was somewhat a fun 3rd outing  i am looking forward to more tom hardy mad max actions
Feb 28 2016,positive,could have used a little more dialogue but apart from that really really good
Feb 27 2016,positive,mad max fury road is literally a crazy ride filled with nonstop action and amazing effects while still bringing enough likable characters to maintain a simple story
Feb 27 2016,negative,character development was delayed and weak as a result didnt care much about the characters or outcome the chase scenes while spectacular defied the laws of physics too often the guitar player was ludicrous great costumes and landscapes though
Feb 27 2016,positive,action action and more actiona fantastic movie to look at visuallybut i was bored a few times and tom hardy says about 10 words it seemed like i dont understand all the oscar buzz when its a story about driving to the middle of the desert and turning around to go fight those in charge
Feb 27 2016,negative,what a load of rubbish story line very poor just a group of misfits being chased by misfits not a patch on the original
Feb 27 2016,negative,pure shinola    this overpraised hunk of crap straight from the down under apocalypse factory  is one of the worst movies of this or any other year it is bereft of any reality  the settings the characters the dialogue almost nonexistent  nothing stands up it is much worse than its three previous outings yet is seen by the critics as much better it is nominated for best picture best director and other accolades and i am struggling to ask how    people who normally hate cgi seem to love millers use of it it does create some stunning backgrounds but thats that critics hail its feminist pov but i have no idea what the hell they are referring to is max a feminist because he helps a group of women try to escape their bondage to a family of insane power hungry men this could have been written in 1950 but never made because of the over the top gruesome treatment    im afraid its another overpraised stinking turd of a film not funny entertaining or involving in any way at all its like putting your head in a video game and hammering yourself with a cgi mallet    dreadful awful crap
Feb 26 2016,neutral,why do people like this movie so much except the ludicrous over the top high octane purposeless 1 hour and 45 minutes of action sequences this is something people apparently like it has nothing going for this lifeless shallow best picture nominee ugh this movie is probably the worst best picture nominee since god knows how long ago    lets face it compared to the originals 2015s requelseboot mad max fury road is story wise disgraceful because it barely has any the only thing this movie does have is purposeless and lifeless action scene upon chase sequence upon explosions upon crazy characters and other ridiculous stuff the story is non existence the things they couldve done in 2015 and with all the resources george miller had available they did this the characters are stail and bland the performances were bad because it mostly consisted of stares and grunting the dialogue it did have was kindergarten level laughable and overall as a fan of the originals this was just a massive disappointment and a disgrace towards the academy for nominating it 10 times    of course im not here to solely hate so what were the positive things  the score was great why wasnt this nominated the costumeproduction design was impeccable and the use of practical effects was sort of impressive    as a final note ive seen this movie once in the theatre i liked half of it after that it got incredibly boring because it pretty much is a 1 hour and 45 minute car chase with cringe worthy moments in between because george miller thought it should have at least something of a dramatic element in this i wanted to watch it again because of how high it was rated after looking it up on imdb and rotten tomatoes to my full surprised even critics were raving about this how so i wanted to watch it again but i didnt want to give miller more of my money and i didnt want to go through that painful experience again
Feb 26 2016,positive,mad max fury road is an explosive action movie with scenes that genuinely made my jaw drop tom hardy suits the role of max better than mel gibson and charlize theron is also brilliant the only problem i have is the first five minutes im just not a fan of sped up action fighting however this is the only bit because the car chases are unique and enthralling the best credit i can give this movie is that it knows when to take a break from the action and add to character development all the characters are well written and well developed and this is definetely one of my favourite films of 2015
Feb 26 2016,positive,with its amazing use of practical effects and character building fury road soars above any action flicks to come out in the last decade it was the best reviewed movie of 2015 and is already clear will become a classic in the future
Feb 26 2016,positive,the movie solely rides on the action sequences screenplay and the setting of the movie and it doesnt dissappoint
Feb 26 2016,positive,an outstanding addition to the franchise mad max fury road delivers and couldnt of come at a better time when i first heard that mel gibson wasnt cast as max i was cynical however come to think about it he is a pensioner now and a physically demanding film like this wouldnt of helped him tom hardy plays the main guy now and once again he performs the utmost stellar performance this film captured everything that made the others great and felt like mad max was never away with the  dystopian environment and high speed chases mad max fury road is an essential chapter and one of the best action films i have seen in ages dare i say one of the best action films
Feb 25 2016,positive,one of the best films of the year and one of the best action movies of all time
Feb 25 2016,positive,whilst scanning through reviews one word crops up throughout mad without wanting to repeat what has already been said there is perhaps no other way to describe fury road other than complete madness few films base themselves around a single sequence in this case an epic chase scene away from the citadel this however works beautifully here surrounding itself with beautifully vibrant scenery and the ever present threat that chases the rig action scenes are inventive dramatic and among the very best that i have seen before unsurprisingly action is well and truly prioritized above any real storytelling or development although when the former is this good then that is completely permissible
Feb 24 2016,positive,a great action film although it seems that it is just madness and destruction in the film it has a fair share of heart tom hardy does a good job but nothing special like mel gibson  still one of the best films of 2015
Feb 24 2016,positive,frantic full throttle fucking excellence best max yet tom hardy rocks
Feb 24 2016,positive,30 years since we last saw max in thunder dome the years have been kind to max as we see a younger and better looking max played by tom hardy taking on bigger badder and crazier villains eternal joe ruled as evil decaying villain deluding the desert urchins as their god keeping a harem of prepubescent girls drinking human milk the elixir of his longevity which he farmed with a flock of fat overweight women its the formidable villain that drives the hero as good as he can be and the story as interesting as is possible max partnered a kick ass furiosa the one armed charlize theron to their death defying roadster battle against evil joe and his desert urchins complete with a team of kettle drum drummers and a electric guitarist playing ferocious metallic music in  his entourage i fantasise seeing a cat fight between furiosa and ripley of aliens this is the fourth mad max instalment but only the first that really put me on the edge of my seat interestingly eternal joe played a villain in mad max 1 as toe cutter that was 35 years ago no wonder eternal joe needs his elixir of youth to keep going
Feb 23 2016,positive,not only do i not see why this movie has a million nominations it doesnt deserve im also curious why people saw it as the greatest action film of 2015 i must not understand this obsession with max not only did i not find it exciting like everyone else but i also found it to have very little to say theres no character development and nothing really makes sense there are a billion more postapocalypse films much better than this one which was a whole lot of nothing i guess it may win for sound and makeup but really best picture im sorry but this movie not only does not deserve to be labeled as best picture it shouldnt be labeled as the best action film of last year maybe in the top ten but most certainly not the best and it most certainly doesnt deserve the accolades it gets i honestly dont see the big deal of a meh film
Feb 23 2016,negative,not very good expected more considering tom hardy was in it but disappointing
Feb 23 2016,positive,very fun movie to watch with great actions scenes and camera work the only thing holding this movie back was the dry story
Feb 23 2016,positive,revolutionary action movie with everything perfect from the blood rushing to large explosions
Feb 23 2016,positive,fantastic movie in 2015
Feb 22 2016,positive,surprisingly entertaining and interesting the shifting alliances between characters who are initially enemies was unexpected that this was really a movie about charlize therons character made this a surprise feminist movie i really hope furiosa gets her own sequel or role in some other way in the future or how about a prequel filling in her back story anyway this still had kind of a ridiculously overblown violence over nothing but thats how humans are
Feb 22 2016,positive,best action thriller i have seen in a long time this is such an awesome movie
Feb 22 2016,positive,mad max is the movie of 2015 as well as miller being the director making a postapocalyptic action flim into a multiawarded visually stunning and highly entertaining flick
Feb 21 2016,neutral,my experience with this film is pretty exhilarating and tiresome  two hours of nonstop action mashed with a heavy metal concert can make your nerve cells scream  kudos to some of the casts performances for making me survive this loud fiesta with something worthy of watching theron who couldve stolen the show ended seconds to a wellrounded performance by hoult
Feb 21 2016,positive,its very entertaining and has a cool style throughout
Feb 21 2016,positive,cruising on a proverbial wave of hype mad max fury road is the first time mr rockatansky has graced our screens since 1985 and it certainly is a thunderous return for the series rarely have chase scenes been so exciting rarely have landscapes looked so gorgeous and rarely has a colour palette been so varied and striking by opting to stage practical action sequences with stunt drivers and real vehicles instead of cgi and computer simulations not only does the action feel more kinetic it also feels more human were seeing real people doing real driving and taking real risks as it was with the indiana jones trilogy it gives everything a more authentic feel and proves that special effects are no substitute for human involvement  with all that said the story in the movie is where a lot is left to be desired the characters while underdeveloped do interact and cooperate in a believable way united in the universal quest for survival and freedom but all of them exist in something of a narrative vacuum the entire thing is more or less a 2hour car chase and while all of these sequences are executed beautifully they dont really serve a higher purpose i definitely wouldnt hail it as the best of the series as many other viewers have done the political commentary is familiar to anyone who has seen the other mm movies and max is as he was in the second film relegated to a supporting performance in his own film but with all that instalment if youre in it for the action this movie delivers like no other in recent memory it could do with being a fair bit meatier but for the adrenaline junky in all of us its more than enough to satisfy our appetites
Feb 21 2016,positive,oh my god this movie is awesome
Feb 21 2016,positive,no doubt its a lot of fun  action packed from the first minute to the last minute  great set designs and special effects  not that its necessarily a bad thing but the movie has no real plot and doesnt really require any thought at all from the viewers standpoint  any idiot can follow this one but it is good clean fun
Feb 21 2016,positive,i had extremely high expectations for this movie yet it still topped them this movie is amazing in fact it is now my favorite movie ever  tom hardys performance is impressive taking his own adaptation of mad max that i liked and charlize theron probably going to receive an oscar for best supporting actress as she was great the action in this is the best action i have ever seen in any action movie huge explosions and great mainly practical effects this movie is a must watch
Feb 21 2016,positive,one of the best action films i have ever seen tom hardy is fucking dope
Feb 20 2016,negative,just a weird movie bad effects and no real ploy
Feb 20 2016,positive,highoctane fever dream would be my pretentious movie critic summation of this one
Feb 20 2016,negative,wow what a disappointment
Feb 19 2016,positive,ive never been a big fan of the mad max movies but i do have to pay respect for how stylistic the filming and editing was along with the great performances and stunt work
Feb 19 2016,negative,hated it possibly the worst movie ive ever tried to watch i almost got up and left  if you like car chases this is for you a 2 hour car chase and i like car chases  oh and its not a mad max film either
Feb 19 2016,positive,grade a  rating 9510
Feb 18 2016,neutral,now why did this movie get nominated for an academy award for best picture this film was insane and outrageous despite the inane lines and dialogue i was in awe of the stunts
Feb 18 2016,positive,filled with jawdropping action sequences striking art direction great sound editing and powerful performances by charlize theron and tom hardy george millers postapocalyptic epic mad max fury road is undoubtedly an adrenalinepumping thrill ride  but in the end unfortunately it failed to impress me
Feb 17 2016,positive,great not as amazing as the critics said 4 stars is a reasonable rating
Feb 17 2016,positive,this movie is one  of the best action movies of all time everything about this movie is great except the story feels a bit empty what doesnt really bother me
Feb 16 2016,positive,unbelievable  may be the best action thriller from beginning to end ever  it feels like every sequence has a climaxworthy aspect to it so youre constantly on a high  charlize is unreal playing her character perfectly  and tom hardy is tom mfin hardy the best choice for max
Feb 16 2016,positive,one of the most fastpaced movies ive ever seen mad maxfury road delivers a stylish postapocalyptic world with the returning character of max rockatansky this movie leaves mel gibsons version buried in the dust
Feb 16 2016,positive,very entertaining however i think it should have been named furiosa rather than mad max
Feb 16 2016,positive,the best action movie ever made
Feb 16 2016,positive,must see for action film fans and aspiring cinematographers
Feb 15 2016,positive,super creative took me to another world  i live  i die  i live again
Feb 15 2016,positive,my favorite film of the year
Feb 14 2016,positive,an exceptional film that will blow your mind with its incredible characters plot and best of all action an instant classic
Feb 14 2016,negative,i think they got the movie title wtf mixed up with this one   total waste of time  unless your a wasted stoner 
Feb 14 2016,negative,this film ranks as the almost worst film i have ever seen nothing can ever be worse than zandaleei hope i acknowledge that there was a plot somewhere in there and pretty cinematography was there a script anyone who thought the actors ought to enunciate their lines a bit perhaps an onscreen graphic to identify which of the bald pale white bad guys we were watching
Feb 14 2016,positive,not as good as original but still good
Feb 14 2016,positive,mad max fury road was nonstop action film the acting was also very tremendous with not much dialogue and all action
Feb 14 2016,negative,pathetic pimpmyride anorexicstill fighting like mike tysonjackie chan draining blood every second still fit as fuck  nominated for fucking oscar  critics can eat shit
Feb 13 2016,negative,been a while since i saw such a 4th grade and thoroughly disgusting film in every aspect well ratings indicate thats what most people like what load of trash story depiction content vulgar too
Feb 13 2016,positive,all too easily the best movie of 2015 though i havent seen any of the other mad max movies yet having no prior opinions or experience with this franchise did not disrupt an otherwise amazing movie great action great story great effects great directing great characters
Feb 13 2016,positive,a great movie with fantastic visuals great acting great set pieces the story maybe needed some tweaks but frank miller please make another mad max this movie had also great screenplay and the movie was gritty which was awesome please watch this or rent it
Feb 13 2016,negative,i wish i could this garbage a minus 10 one of the worst movies ever and to think this mindless nonsense was given 10 oscar nominations an absolute shame
Feb 12 2016,positive,it was a very good that kept you interested the whole time
Feb 12 2016,positive,this might go down as my favorite film of all time or at least make the top 5  bad ass action amazing effects a surprisingly engaging plot considering its a 2 hour car chase for the most part make this film amazing  i found myself caring about every single one of the protagonists no matter how little their screen time or interaction  just a masterfully done film    but what really does it for me  every single time i see it every time i catch it on a movie channel somewhere in the middle its still good  no matter what point i come in or how many times i see it this movie does not get old  it is always good
Feb 11 2016,positive,a perfect movie dropping you into the chaos of a world gone mad but the camera directed well enough that everything is clear
Feb 11 2016,positive,george millars grisly road movie takes an australian cult hit and gives it an allamerican makeover almost  loud and proud with little beneath its grisly veneer mad max fury road coughs up the kind of twoandahalf hour car chase we typically get the from the later fast and furious films but fury road gives hollywoods tired and tested formula a twist  genuine visual flair with sprinklings of dusty nostalgia  gorgeously grimy makeup effects give us some of the most meticulous mutants weve seen on screen in years yet with next to no mythology or background offered for any of its characters  or even a tangible plot  fury road slams on a mental brake long before it starts to pick up speed  fury road is fast fun and stylistically superb but for all its merits itll only ever be enjoyed in a what the hell did i just watch kind of way
Feb 11 2016,positive,like nothing ive ever watched before  insane and inyourfaceeven to the point of being too much at times for me personally  i never felt close to any of the characters though
Feb 10 2016,positive,mad max fury road is an action packed thrill ride the stunts and performances particularly charlize theron are topnotch
Feb 9 2016,positive,i definitely enjoyed it the second time around a lot more but im also a little drunk the production involved in this film is unreal every detail on the surface was incredible the story could have been a bit stronger but ill let that slide because i was entertained and charlie theron was hot as fuck ive had a crush on her since i was a kid stoked for the sequel
Feb 9 2016,negative,terrible beyond terrible top 3 worst movies ive ever seen i love sci fi this movie was just 3 long car chases zero character development mad max hardly spoke i love action movies this wasnt even artistic in my opinion  sorry for the poor review for those that acted in and worked on the movie but i wasumbfoinded this actually got any good reviews this is the first negative review ive ever written i am breaking my rule of speaking only positively if i give an opinion but it was just 3 long car chases with no character growth i am refraining from writing a thousand details of the terrible action etcratsi love the old mad max
Feb 9 2016,positive,oh what a movie what a lovely movie
Feb 9 2016,positive,i was told to expect a blitz of incredible visuals and inventive action and just hold on for the ride and all of that is true but i was also warned that its shy in the story department i didnt find that to be true at all there are themes that are worthy there it doesnt dig deep but its just enough to keep the movie grounded like
Feb 9 2016,positive,hard core action film
Feb 9 2016,positive,exciting action and original visionary imaging and photography brings the post apocalyptic world of mad max into the modern era miller is at his best and charlize theron makes you care about her and her plight hardy fills maxs shoes ably but speak5 words the whole film definitely gets your heart pumping 01302016
Feb 9 2016,positive,a frenetic ride to say the least mad max fury road is a non stop action ride  its a powerful hard hitting in your face action movie and brings this franchise back to life with a style
Feb 9 2016,positive,this movie is an unstoppable roller coaster with genuine actiongreat characters and smart script which had something to tell and it did a great job in telling its themes subtly without lionising it
Feb 8 2016,positive,mad max fury road sees the return of much loved post apocalyptic franchise and restores it to its former glory while i wasnt completely blown away by any special story characters and drama in this picture its sheer spectacle and visuals were just breath taking as far as cinematography is concerned its the best film of the year it also pulls more than its weight in the action department bringing in some of the most jaw dropping and adrenaline pumping action in film history so as a chase movie it is at the top of its class however a cinematic master peice not entirely it does seem very derivative of mad max 2 at times and as i said again it seems more style over substance aswell but thats not allways a bad thingid say check it out
Feb 8 2016,positive,post apocalyptic fun with robust special effects decent scenery and fight scenes
Feb 8 2016,positive,a much better action chase movie than i had originally anticipated
Feb 8 2016,positive,is it a perfect movie no but what this movie does right is stick characters that are believable and that you care for in a world where death and action is overly prominent  george miller takes us back to film making roots with practical effects and a solid use of minor cgi when needed  hopefully this will set an example as to how filmmakers should take their babies seriously
Feb 7 2016,positive,i being 16 going on 17 am a victim of not having seen the original mad max films i mean theyre way before my time and frankly anything that has to do with mel gibson doesnt have the same magical touch as it did before with that said this movie melted my face off completely off its a hardcore postapocalyptic nightmare that blends beautiful direction with breathtaking cinematography to birth a heartpounding experience a lot of the criticism revolves around the titular character serving as a sort of passenger to his own story which i had no problem with it effectively crafted a story with more than his own words or actions to say and goddamn this movie greatly benefited from that quite possibly the best movie of 2015
Feb 7 2016,positive,after 20 something years a good sequel
Feb 6 2016,positive,perfect very rare for a movie to have top notch action sequences mind blowing visual n audio effects and great acting this is a frequent flyer on my tv
Feb 6 2016,positive,awesome film tom hardy and charlize theron are magnificent it is an edge of your seat thrill ride with great characters and cinematography shot in the african desert that left me in awe many times throughout the storytelling was excellent even with the lean economical scripting even if post apocalyptic stories are not normally your thing the hopeful twist to the narrative here and the great performances will appeal to just about anyone
Feb 6 2016,negative,so many awards i seem to sense a bad odor could it be rotting tomatoes rarely have i read so many revealing reviews from viewers covering all corners of the globe those that have seen through the thin computer game mentality of this repetitious mess are asking if there may be the workings of an international promotion behind the unbelievable hype for such a dumbing down of filmic art  never underestimate the intelligence of the viewing public  lest you find they start throwing rotten eggs at your rotten tomatoeswhats really afoot here the world may not yet be ready for the generation of cattle
Feb 5 2016,positive,in my opinion the best of the entire franchise mad max fury road will blow you away with its action sequences and visuals people complain that the storytelling and character handling is weak i disagree because this film is visual storytelling and george miller handles it so well tom hardy is great as max even though i prefer mel gibson tom hardy still pulls it off very well however charlize theron stole the show she was brilliant in the film and a great character one of the best action movies ever made go see this film now or you are doing a disservice
Feb 5 2016,positive,i couldnt stop re playing how tom hardy charlize theron george miller action and speech in the movie the developed culture and post apocalypse politics in the movies really really exhilarating and vivid and realistic each blood scene or even the drop of water on the floor render a huge impact of the complication of the envionment and each character use their best and the most simple way to show the brutal side of humanity and the other side
Feb 4 2016,positive,a transfer of the original idea in australia to america had the old electrical posts that are being changed out to cylinder shape shows the lack of foreseeing a design change and ultimate progress having a main character imperator furiosa a female when the original mad max had all males in main roles was a good choice with the idea that females in main characters draw the females to see movies that are not just all male within an usual male action and story with high violence even in fiction women in history have been denied their strength in a violent world that if there is peace and quiet there is thankfulness near the end of the movie one character of immortan joes wives prays to anyone who will hear
Feb 4 2016,positive,amazing production design beautifully shot lacks a bit of depth and i got kind of tired of the dayfor night shooting charlize theron was good in it and tom hardy did his best to keep his face still while wiggling his eyes around mel gibson style but i just didnt really feel like he was the same character bonus points for including a group of women warriors that were cool and believable it builds off of the 2nd and 3rd movies but seemed to forget the first maybe im forgetting a mention or flashback to his family or his memories of civilization maybe that just showed how far away civilization as we know it was in the past the part about not knowing what a tree was was pretty cool the acting was ok basically this movie is just a lot of screaming and fighting with an array of inventive postapocalyptic technology dirty white people screaming and killing each other in fantastic ways they tried to humanize mad max by giving him ptsd but i didnt really see the need to go in to detail about his madness just wind him up and let him go its a pulp movie
Feb 3 2016,positive,every year theres that film that comes out of nowhere and simply kills it last year it was guardians of the galaxy for me even thought it was hyped plenty it still surprised me mad max fury road might be that film for this year  its almost always better to know as little as possible about movies before going in for mad max i couldnt have even told you it was supposed to be set in the future i only knew it was a mel gibson trilogy from the early 80s what a ride mad max is one of the best action films ive seen in a long time i wouldnt recommend it to everyone its out there but its a great film tom hardy is supposedly contracted for more films and if they are as good as fury road ill be there to see them
Feb 3 2016,positive,cant really talk bout this film without giving anything away just to say it certainly has wow factor and left me jaw dropped what a ride the most exciting film ive seen in a long time and one that definitely benefits from blu ray
Feb 2 2016,positive,a little too weird for my taste  i liked the scenes where they were blue under the moon its cool how they coloured that  everything was nonstop action and i didnt really see the point in the all  disappointed i couldnt see what lead to this kind of world and disappointed i couldnt see the change after it was all done
Feb 2 2016,negative,amazing graphics unbelievably slow and boring plot ive been told by people who love this movie that its better to watch the previous mad max films to understand but i just thought this was going to be so much more interesting i feel like this only got great reviews because of nostalgia for some people and very impressive graphics
Feb 2 2016,positive,my name is max my world is fire and blood once i was a cop a road warrior searching for a righteous cause as the world fell each of us in our own way was broken it was hard to know who was more crazy me or everyone else
Feb 1 2016,positive,a must see the visuals a breathtaking everything about it is insane thats why its fun rewatch value is definitely high
Feb 1 2016,positive,great chase movie with very little substance
Jan 31 2016,positive,fantastic stunts are worth the price of admission for this violent flick about a uturn desire for a green place and the fight for water rights other than amazing visual effects not my cup of tea
Jan 31 2016,positive,beautiful cinematography entertaining characters and some of the best action ive ever seen mad max is a solid and memorable movie
Jan 31 2016,positive,very very weak plot but the visuals and action sequences made up for it three cheers for george millers upcoming mad max trilogy
Jan 31 2016,negative,a very well made 2 hour long music videohardly any dialogue or ploti was so bored didnt make it through the whole thingim glad it didnt get more than technical oscars
Jan 31 2016,negative,almost unwatchable movie
Jan 31 2016,positive,the best movie ive seen in 2015 hell one of the best movies ive ever seen knows when to let off the throttle and when to put the peddle to the metal
Jan 31 2016,positive,always liked madmax films maybe in fact the mel gidson genre was better but this is very good  i think you need to see this a couple of times there is so much going on in the background the swinging polecats the war boys on the treadmills working the lifts good film some people you want to survive sadly dont most that you do not want to dont either 
Jan 30 2016,positive,my favorite movie of 2015 one of the greatest movies of the 21st century
Jan 30 2016,negative,good heavens this was awful no plot no character development no point nothing but a pair of long chase scenes just hideous
Jan 30 2016,positive,not your ordinary mad max thats for sure but i really like the twist in it
Jan 30 2016,positive,an absolute must see of 2015 a near flawless action film
Jan 30 2016,neutral,let me preface this by saying im not a fan of mad max i was bored in mad max and was almost bored in the road warrior    i was underwhelmed i heard all of the hype about how mad max fury road was one of the greatest movies ever made and how its a cinematic masterpiece about how it gives you a rush and sometimes you need a break just to slow your heartbeat     i honestly dont get it    maybe the hype behind the movie is what i see when i see fury road what i see when i watch fury road is something that is just all spectacle is the action good to look at youre damn right it is the car carnage of the wasteland is incredible to look at theres a guy with a flamethrower guitar but thats not what i want to stand out the most when i see a movie    the main thing i look for when im watching a movie like this a a combination of exciting and engaging action as well as a good story this movie lacks the story part because it is too simple there is not a lot about the wasteland and its inhabitants that makes me interested about them how did furiosa get that arm how did imorton joe rise to power who were those people that max was haunted by who were those people on the sticks there is no context given so im not interested and do not care is furiosa a badass yes but as cool as that is i dont care about her because i know so little    in summation mad max fury road is all spectacle and nice to look at but really nothing else
Jan 30 2016,neutral,impressive visuals and some interesting female characters but overall i just found it rather unpleasant and ultimately rather tedious
Jan 30 2016,positive,one of my all time favorite movies constant action and drama highly recommend
Jan 30 2016,positive,george miller directed a modern update to his mad max chronicles that amped the narration the actionpacked visuals and the performances to some excitement in the entertainment value but the feeling isnt mutual to the taste of the unappealing nature that also was given the update nonetheless this is actually the most entertaining ride yet even without mel gibson who was nicely replicated by tom hardy b    full review coming soon
Jan 30 2016,negative,just dont see what all the hype was aboutthe storyline doesnt really captivate and the characters are flimsy and distant
Jan 30 2016,neutral,set design 20 its everything miller wanted with the previous ones hardy hardly impresses
Jan 29 2016,positive,great movie watched it 4 times 
Jan 29 2016,positive,im not ready to hail it as the masterpiece that everyone else is calling it but mad max fury road is still a hell of a film needless to say the action is awesome but the performances are fantastic and work hand in hand with the narrative and themes and charlize theron as furiosa is a triumph of a character
Jan 29 2016,negative,very disappointing no character building and felt like a 2 hour trailer
Jan 29 2016,positive,do you think tom hardy knows he was the costar in this film charlene is like a wounded animal fighting to her last breathe you cant help but be captivated by her performance from start to end were taking on a ride for survival
Jan 28 2016,neutral,maybe 40 lines of dialogue with lots of explosions
Jan 28 2016,positive,great movie and i loved the fact that traditional methods of special effects were used like with the new star wars movie but i felt that it doesnt totally live up to the hype that most people give it its great but not the best
Jan 27 2016,negative,how this film was nominated for best picture is mind boggling this is 2 hours of my life i will never get back absolutely one of the worst films i have ever watched yes some of the action sequences were entertaining but the story was weak and pointless
Jan 27 2016,positive,     franchise             originals            
Jan 27 2016,positive,what is there to be said that hasnt already been said of all the action movies   youre ever likely to see this is the best one     the acting is fantastic and each one is given a character that you can relate to the story is a chase movie but its a simple it is so primal in theme that anyone can relate to it the villain is intimidating and every stake action and decision has real consequences everyone from fans of good story telling to fans of good acting to lovers of cinema in general will love this movie in fifty years time this movie will be remembered studied and loved by future generations of movie goers long after so many other cheesy action flicks and many films in general are long forgotten        count on it
Jan 27 2016,positive,i guess it was pretty decent but i had hoped for something more mel gibsons versions are far superior
Jan 26 2016,positive,the first 15 minutes seemed super cracked out than i began to accept it then i started to like it by the end i was laughing maniacally to all the ridiculously over the top stylized violence thoroughly entertaining in such a sad sadistic way that its positively hilarious
Jan 26 2016,positive,mad max fury road improves upon its predecessors with a fourth round of breathtaking action writerdirector george miller finds himself  at his peak bringing back to life the road warrior with a whole new cast that delivers some of the brightest performances of the year hardy was great but it is theron that owns the show with her iconic furiosa that shall be reminded as of the most compelling contemporary heroins
Jan 26 2016,positive,fantastic action movie  spoiled all other actions movies for me ive seen it twice in the theater and once at home  still love it
Jan 26 2016,positive,i cant get enough of this movie i pretty much think overall todays movies are garbage they dont make em the way they used to but this movie punches you in the face  doesnt let up thank you george for making a great piece of exciting entertainment
Jan 26 2016,positive,a surprisingly worthy sequel to the original series the director captured the ambiance of the desolate mad max universe through excellent photography and music the action scenes are very good but i am saturated by the genre
Jan 26 2016,positive,mad max fury road is the best movie of 2015 hands down its one of those movies that gets better and better after each viewing and its the perfect example of how to do an action movie
Jan 25 2016,positive,mad max fury road is easily the best movie ive seen in 2015
Jan 25 2016,positive,this is the first oft he nad max ive ever seen so
Jan 25 2016,positive,enjoyed every second of it
Jan 24 2016,positive,absolutely stunning visually action blockbuster starring tom hardy taking over the lead role from mel gibson and he doesnt disappoint highly recommended
Jan 24 2016,positive,a decent action movie but i think they had missed  the essence of what made the original ones great        film making isnt trying to make action films realistic but rather more like a parody  if youre from the millennial generation   generation y  you will probably prefer this film more than the original mad max films that were done with real stunt men doing real heavy duty stunts   like getting thrown from a car going 60 mph  having  nothing to land on but cardboard boxes   not computer generated jinnjoint stunts that do a decent action movie but i think they had missed the essence of what made the original ones great which was more realer drama which this movie had none of    for the way action movies are today i give this film a c  common    ps    to kenr  the world may not yet be ready for the generation of cattle but its where the action film industry is head
Jan 24 2016,negative,pointless snuff film not missing anything
Jan 24 2016,positive,one of my favorite movies of this year and possibly of all time this movie was stylistically and visually beautiful there was some really great worldbuilding in this movie and i love the subtly incorporated vikingnordic cultural influences in the mad max postapocalyptic universe i actually wasnt a huge fan of tom hardy and likewise was also not blown away by charlize theron or any of the other acting in this movie however this movie was so beautiful i couldnt resist giving this movie a resounding 55 stars
Jan 24 2016,positive,mad max was a weirdly entertaining and action packed ride the symbolism and story telling was fascinating i just wish there was less car chase
Jan 24 2016,negative,i found this movie to be incomprehensible and stupid  rescued to the two star level only by its stunning art design    supposedly this is some post apocalyptic world were in but there is no back story presented to create any context for the characters or their motivations  mad max gets kidnapped and strapped to the front of a vehicle and we watch cars blow each other up  theres not that much more going on  until maybe 60 into the movie when the charlize theron character explains shes trying to get back home  and eventually needs to return to where the movie started    there are bizarre kings and crazed punks and a few siren slaves whose presence appears again with little context  people spray themselves with paint one truck has a wonderful rock guitarist strapped to the front whose axe shoots flames out of its neck  and this goes on for two and a quarter hours    however the way the visuals are conceived is stunning  the home city has mammoth levels strung on hyperindustrial styled gears with muscular percussionists pounding out something  for some reason  it looks cool  but to no intelligent end
Jan 24 2016,positive,epic just epic thats how you make action movies
Jan 24 2016,positive,i liked this movie a lot more than i thought i would edge of my seat
Jan 24 2016,positive,as far as action films go this is hands down one of the best of all time in my book nothing can amount to the fastpaced action and for todays standards with so many companies relying on cgi stuff it is amazing to see a directorfilm finally taking the bold step to make an action film the good ole fashioned way with real stunts and actors george miller really knocked this one out of the park not to mention a great performance by hardy  theron
Jan 24 2016,negative,just an excuse for a video game turned it off
Jan 24 2016,positive,in an era where action movies rely heavily on cgi its refreshing to see a movie like mad max the film is a great combination of story character development stunts and action thats over the top in just the perfect amount
Jan 23 2016,positive,mad max fury road review explosive madness out of its mind 9ish    his name is max  and hes a man of few words    writerdirector george miller has brought his apocalyptic franchise back from the wasteland for a revisiting  he refuses to call this a reboot or sequel mad max fury road is filled with gorgeous chaotic action all shot in a spectacular fashion    fiery vehicle chases check lightningfilled sandstorms check deranged war boy playing a guitar with flamethrower attached um check    we mustnt question the madness  we must just accept it one may get a dry throat and need water watching the film  ill pass on the scarce worshipped breast milk though    max rockatansky tom hardy has visions of his murdered family as he seeks ultimate redemption he wants to go home but theres a problem  he doesnt have one    the movie opens with max being chased through a postapocalyptic desert and captured he is taken to immortan joes citadel where joe hugh keaysbyrne viscously rules by controlling the only supply of water max is hooked up to be a living blood bank for the war boys joes psychotic army    max is chained to nuxs nicholas hoult car as the war boys chase after the rebel imperator furiosa charlize theron shes on the run for stealing the five wives of her boss immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne her plan is to take the women  the breeders  in search of the green place this is home to water fruit plants and grass  a sharp contrast to the apocalyptic desert where they live  and a better life    after max escapes  and after a few early scuffles  he and furiosa form an uneasy alliance more a case of the enemy of my enemy is my friend than true friendship    eventually max furiosa and the wives along with a reformed war boy nux decide to turn around and take down the psychotic empire thats after them    if it was wild when furiosa turned left it gets a whole lot wilder when they turn around    the movie itself is worth the cost of the dvdbluray but the special features are really what set it apart from the rest the insight is important to truly understand why this film boasts a 97 percent certified fresh rating from rotten tomatoes    the most fascinating thing about the film is the stunts which use real stuntmen the production crew even brought members of cirque du soleil to help out there were many moments on set when george miller was quite concerned about potential injuries from blowing cars up or pole dancers not that kind of pole dancer mounted on moving vehicles    fury road was created entirely from storyboards 3500 panels of them in fact the crew decided the deserts of africa were the best place to shoot for there were several chases involved that covered many miles and they needed that environment    the conditions were tough on the cast because it was extremely cold when they began the eightmonthlong production the actors said it was isolating and seemed to make them a little crazier    in one special feature hardy says he had lunch with mel gibson the original max who passed the torch    theres an underlying feminist stance throughout the whole movie which is covered in a special feature with the five wives and furiosa miller wanted to create a powerful woman who had great beauty but was also a warrior to stand against max the five wives are worshipped because they breed joes babies hardy said it is very much furiosas movie and max is just along for the ride as a companion    there is a special feature included that is dedicated to the 140 vehicles created for the movie with many different makes and models military trucks were used as the foundation due to their bulky strong bodies the crew covers the most important vehicle in the movie the war rig in depth miller refers to it as the most important character other than the humans    expect the film to hang around during award season because there has never been an action movie like this  it will kick your ass to paraphrase the war boys cry fury road is perfect in every way    check out our content at ishmovieswordpresscom
Jan 23 2016,negative,artsie fartsie  whacked out crap no wonder it was nominated for best picture the academy is as whacked as this movie some films you just dont remake run far away from this 
Jan 23 2016,positive,throws you in a chase and dares you to catch up your questions will be answered along the way while prepare for chase scenes unlike any youve seen before
Jan 23 2016,positive,better than the original with mel gibson and with an array of powerful female characters this is a great action movie but should not have been a best movie nominee
Jan 23 2016,positive,wicked good and i didnt expect that
Jan 23 2016,positive,the graphics were great and the chicks ruled in this flick
Jan 23 2016,negative,i think tom hardy is a great actor but i didnt like him in this film and found his portrayal of the character lack lustre it felt like a pointless film which just went round in a huge circle for no real purpose
Jan 23 2016,negative,best picture nominee  seriously i cant believe i made it through half the movie  what a waste of time
Jan 23 2016,positive,a fun actionpacked movie nonetheless i enjoyed it for what it was and no more
Jan 23 2016,negative,this was for sure the worst movie i have seen in years
Jan 23 2016,neutral,boring  all fx zero plot or story  turnoff your brain if you want to watch and enjoy
Jan 22 2016,negative,im blown away at the critics score and all the awards this movie received there were parts that were entertaining but for it to have the same tomato score as the godfather is insanity this movie belongs on tnt or tbs one more thing how distracting was the guy playing guitar
Jan 22 2016,positive,decent story line but the the action and music alone make it worth the watch
Jan 22 2016,negative,ish  no character build up so you even give a second thought to these people  not even close to the first mad max movie
Jan 22 2016,positive,fun exciting action but lacks substance  some characterization unfortunately
Jan 22 2016,positive,a non stop roller coaster ride in a 2 hour extravaganza mad max fury road is exciting as it is brilliant in its display of a meaningful story told through visuals and expressive acting as well as the best action ive seen in years
Jan 21 2016,positive,i prefer sugenes review that movie was just freakazoid people spray painting their teeth
Jan 21 2016,neutral,pos apocaliptical very theatrical broadway dry angry fast and furious show  like beath taken action scenes and thats about it
Jan 21 2016,positive,amazing visually but the nearly constant violence is boring
Jan 21 2016,positive,this is going to be the action film with an actionpacked plot that is going to be remembered for decades i loved this movie and it really is one of the best action movies i have seen in a while and is easily a contender for one of the best movies of the year
Jan 21 2016,positive,an action masterpiece with no equal
Jan 21 2016,positive,one of the best movies of 2015
Jan 21 2016,positive,lots of great over the top action but thats it
Jan 20 2016,positive,total nonstop action movie with too many flaw  in some scenes the animation looks so 80s the plot is average the dialogue is not very good     overall its a high costed average movie
Jan 20 2016,negative,i simply do not understand how the audience score is this high  the movie was extremely monotonous had little to no story and i truly felt dumber for having watched it  i liked the original mad max beyond thunderdome not so much but it was still head and shoulders above this one   it is visually amazing no question  but there was no story and dialog was barely above grunting
Jan 19 2016,positive,a great action movie only compromised by its relentless political correctness
Jan 19 2016,negative,really quiet an average remake i enjoyed the first one a lot more however it is nominated in that popularity contest called the oscars for 10 awards impossible to believe  perhaps the silliest part is the guitar crossed with a flamethrower
Jan 19 2016,negative,its so hard for me to believe that this film was the highest rated film of 2015 my wife stopped watching after 15 minutes i watched the whole thing but regret doing so it was awful
Jan 19 2016,positive,this fourth installment of the mad max series shows that even today you dont need much cgi to make another thrilling action film
Jan 19 2016,positive,youll find a widerange of opinions on this movie some love it for its intense action with amazing stunts this is absolutely true others will say its shallow and redundant while others say it handles serious themes subversively under a backdrop of action i think its a mix of both you could analyze this movie and make it seem like a piece written by a literature master protagonists taking their freedom woman empowerment and environmental awareness to some extent this is all on display how much credit should be given to miller and co whether or not miller wanted to just use a story to display precisehuge action sequences or he actually wanted to say something we wont know but some credit should be given for its narrative heft rtcom intentional or a result of just good storytelling for me the  action did get redundant also i didnt root enough for the five wives escape it seemed they had it better than the rest of the city many cultures accept multiple wives were they slaves that hated their lives most likely but this was made even more unclear when one of the five wives actually contemplated going back i also wish max got back into his car and wreaked more havoc overall i liked it but its not the best of the year like some claim it to be
Jan 18 2016,positive,a milestone in action movies george miller brings to live a post apocalictic universe amazing to look at
Jan 18 2016,negative,this simply was not a very good movie   i was tricked into watching this by friends who claimed charlize therons performance was awesome it wasnt and a fresh air interview with the writer and director      side note  somehow i didnt realize that he also did babe until hearing the interview  babe is such a charming movie and high on my desert island list      yet this mad max was not fun but did have a few interesting concepts the guitar that shoots flames for example  the amazonian tribe from whence therons character originated could have been a really interesting twist  instead they race stupidly back and forth across the desert into extinction  i cannot recommend it
Jan 18 2016,positive,although its won audiences and critics alike the world over this is not the definitive mad max film a likeable cast heads a dystopian piece packed full of beautiful cinematics and jaw clenching action sequences yet despite this i left the film feeling a lack of awe and inspiration this is in part due to the tiresome plot which acts as a prophetic odyssey but instead frames as a consistent action pursuit romp although played by the talented hardy i found the titular lead underwhelming and underdeveloped i feel this had less to do with hardys performative efforts and more to do with the characterisation in the script and plot this may be in part a nostalgic attempt by miller to homage its previous incarnation or an unfortunate sideeffect from the emphasis on therons furiosa whatever the reason i find the underwhelming nature of such an original and iconoclast character to be a great departure from gibsons lunatic apocalypse cop and as such the major downfall of the piece   whilst certainly a good movie one cant help thinking its not deserving of the multitudes of praise which it is being given
Jan 18 2016,positive,its cinematic heavy metal
Jan 18 2016,positive,this movie is amazing the acting is great but the star of this movie is the practical effects which are so beautiful this film is mostly action and the plot is interesting george miller came out of retirement to make this movie and i thank him for doing soget this movie on dvd now
Jan 18 2016,negative,an awful cash in on  the far superior mad max 2
Jan 18 2016,negative,terrible storyline after 2 hrs of waiting when does the real movie start
Jan 18 2016,positive,i wasnt the biggest fan of the story line of this movie but if you put aside all of that the special effects in this movie was like watching avatar for the first time amazing also for once in a long time the hero in the movie is a woman which automatically adds a different effect and meaning to the story but it also makes it 100 better
Jan 18 2016,negative,would have been a 5star rating but i gave it half a star because of that guitarplaying scene that was the most cringeworthy thing ive ever seen
Jan 17 2016,positive,in our modern world of cgi trash a masterpiece has come has come forth this movie uses epic visuals that are shire kickassery thats all i can say you cant help but noticing of the originality in this post apocalyptic world it was so in depth that it reminds me of tolkien thats saying a lot i mean seriously he would write short novels about a stupid sword i loved every aspect of this movie and hope george miller has more to come
Jan 17 2016,positive,while i did not find myself particularily engaged on a story level the action is technically mesmerizing and finds new and creative ways to show destruction and movement in film terrifically well shot and edited i can enthusiastically recommend it merely for being so uniquely fun to look at
Jan 17 2016,positive,this is probably 1 of the best movies ive ever
Jan 17 2016,negative,too weird for me  not sure why everybody loved it
Jan 17 2016,negative,i watched ones being curious about the new mad max and ended disappointed nothing impressive as actors play or plot not worth to keep a dvd or digital copy
Jan 17 2016,positive,george millers fury road is full of car chasesin fact the whole film is a hyper presentation of the mad max world miller started out actually dealing with editing and the vehicle chases in the earlier mad max movies this film is sped up literally in order to keep the pace and you definitely lose a sense of rational it is a chase to be remembered with wild special effects tom hardy is passable as mad max although he could be any man fighting his way through a dystopian society charlize theron added her touch to her heroine of the piece with a relish that would make sigourney weaver in aliens proud yet i kept on saying that this film is nominated against films like spotlight and the revenant it certainly is well made though i do not think it warrants the nominations i loved george millers eye for detail he hired a mega team to handle it all and its focus for detail showed up in earlier films my favorite would be babe a story about a pigs life yet this picture is beyond cecil b demille and borders on a pink floyd the wall approach you know theres a good guy people to be saved and the bad guys and you work your way to the end afterwards you feel assaulted the theatre had the volume turned on super high and left breathless it is a roller coaster ride of a movie yet i left the theatre not knowing or caring much for the characters i wanted to explore maxs psyche further he was no more than a persona much like clint eastwoods man with no name in the age of video games you would hope that detail would not be lost in this case you will lose yourself in the design of the movie fantastic special effects and makeup are present you cant help but admire the technical artistry you just hope there would be more heart lurking somewhere in such a technical achievement
Jan 17 2016,negative,so much action that you almost forget that people can talk there all you see a road trip where was movie
Jan 17 2016,positive,creative and exciting visually dazzling and totally insane with amazing performances by charlize theron and tom hardy mad max fury road is a showcase for george miller direction and serves as a proof that a movie action can be deep emotional and funny all the same time and leave the audiences to the edge of their sits every second
Jan 17 2016,positive,this movie is sensational
Jan 17 2016,positive,this film looks great it should win a few of the lesser oscars due to how it looks on our screens the story is basic the cast are not challenged to put in a good performance but this is still a very enjoyable film
Jan 17 2016,neutral,its a highly stylized action packed bloody gory overthetop film that probably appeals to the majority of 18 to 30yearolds whove spent a lot of time playing equally bloody video games the story is pretty basic women escape from hell looking for liberty and life only to return after killing the evil ruler and his main henchmen to start anew oh and the top babe almost i said almost remember now this is the apocalyptic future no time for hope here has feelings for her accidental saviour ah what a romance     with many of the horrific destructive fight scenes fought at such an exaggerated  frantic pace its a surprise all involved dont merely die from heart attacks but you get a general idea what the film is going for when the bossmans babe is dead and he has one of his henchmen cut the dead mom open only to see if his baby is alive and upon finding that he is dead i almost had a baby brother i almost had a baby brother he is tossed aside like so much dead meat at times the antics of the death squad is so silly its almost comical such as when they spray their teeth with chrome an allusion to the love for the shiny vehicles they worship as they hope for a battle death to take them via glory to valhalla     an often silly even unnecessarily abusive film to convey a story of little import that means little to most that is unless youre an aspiring death squad recruit looking to take out the boss man to glory and victory spray spray
Jan 16 2016,negative,one of the worst films ive ever witnessed boring awful acting worse special effects  no story its just one longextremely dull chase god knows why reviewers are jumping on the praise bandwagon     every person i know thats seen it agrees i therefore have no idea where all the positive reviews are coming from and im a film buff    aviod at all costs
Jan 16 2016,negative,i cant believe anyone is rating this movie 5 stars  awful movie with less than mediocre acting  if you like violence this is the movie for you
Jan 16 2016,positive,not a best picture but really cool visuals and well done action sequences not one i can really watch multiple times but in a one time viewing its really unique
Jan 16 2016,negative,my anticipation was high academy award nomination for best picture almost 100 critic score on rotten tomatoes over 80 on imdb charlize theron great reviews but this is where the fun stops    what a dud it was despite all the action story a woman rebels against a tyrannical ruler in post apocalyptic australia in search for her homeland with the help of a group of female prisoners a psychotic worshipersic and a drifter named max    i guess if you have great memories of the original movie or if you have a thing for george miller this was the greatest thing ever especially in super duper 3d to me it was a neverending car chase from point a to b and then back to a filled with fighting scenes flat characters supermodels turned wannabeactresses and an almost mute protagonist what else did i expect from a schizophrenic writerdirector who not only created the mad max franchise nearly forty years ago but whose last three writing and directing credits are babe pig in the city and happy feet 1  2    i guess i expected too much even with so much garbage polluting the big screen these days this one didnt rise above most of the big budget muck that we get to enjoy as entertainment im not even going to waste more words on this one sorry i didnt get it shame it made almost half a billion dollars at the box office there will surely be more of the same this year or the next    pros lots of hype  cons everything else  verdict avoid
Jan 16 2016,negative,was i watching the same movie as everyone else i watch all kinds of film and its rare for me not to enjoy any thing i just thought this was crap no story whatsoever poor performances just a load of effects for the sake of it all style no substance   some parts i was laughing as it was so stupid was it supposed to be a comedy  the rest of the time thinking what the hell is this sht is it nearly finished yet  dont get what all the hype and awe around this film is all about one of the worst films ive seen seems to be just me though the only thing i enjoyed was the makeup effects
Jan 16 2016,positive,although quite grotesque in its style and imagery  something i rarely like  in cinematographic and storytelling terms its highly refined  i did not like it at first the introduction fell flat with me some scenes felt spedup and it was just weird i also felt that the world felt absurd and comicy and indeed it is the film does not shy away from this fact it actually embraces it  the characters felt real and their motivations felt real enough for me to eventually be drawn in despite the absurdity of the setting  and this i can respect  yes it had some gruesome scenes of violence but it didnt focus on them  this was my first mad max film i assume the flashbackshallucinations somehow connect to the previous films happily they werent overused and the plot didnt hinge entirely upon them so even a newb like me can enjoy this film
Jan 16 2016,negative,fury road illustrates how far the mad max story has evolved or devolved as this viewer would attest upstream the first mad max was a unique  exhilarating dystopian nightmare of a semihorrific road rage film encapsulating the raw brutishness of the australian collective consciousness of the 1970s remember it wasnt made that long after aboriginal first nations peoples gained the right to vote and then truck engine sized cars roamed the aussie roads where roadside eucalyptus trees had big american copies of gm and ford cars wrapped around the trees making them look like tinsel on aussie christmas trees set in the blinding heat and dust of the outback one could be forgiven for feeling like being in a george miller film even outside the cinema in the australian reality of the time fury road has a jerry bruckheimerish feel to it with australian models who act like a gang of bangers from zoolander walking down the catwalk with david bowie wincing at their garish derelict ozziestyle clothing but the film has somehow captured an audience who seeks solace in a cinema from the everpresent real thrills and spills of the dominant paradigm of daily worldwide terrorism events
Jan 15 2016,positive,i would give ten stars off i could
Jan 15 2016,positive,wowthat was some insanity not sure what to even say about this one awesome
Jan 15 2016,neutral,surprisingly not that great i found it too repetitive with tireless car chase scenes the story was ok but not great the kings son was a terrible actor also the love story between the evil turned good guy and one of the wives was too quick and unbelievable the guitar guy with a flaming guitar in the car parade was stupid the scenes were fun to watch and the action was entertaining but overall i was very disappointed not really recommended
Jan 15 2016,negative,boring mindless all that running across the desert for no reason shallow meaningless characters weird stupid setup nothing believable or fun here
Jan 15 2016,positive,started slow confusing at first intense action great effects and creativity soars out of this world
Jan 15 2016,negative,this was the most overrated movie ive seen from 2015 if the only purpose of movies is 2 hours of explosions then youre good but if your looking for an actual story keep moving nothing to see here
Jan 15 2016,positive,excellent movie from start to finish
Jan 15 2016,positive,a great action film with little story but you enjoy every moment of it i prefer the originals but this has the same feeling and some great acting it uses practical effects which are noticeable and appreciated
Jan 15 2016,negative,another sign the apocalypse has literally descended upon the motion picture academy mad max fury road gets 10 oscar nominations including a best picture im sorry but did they see the same film i did it was fast and furious in fright wigs and kiss makeup and the only acting was charlize theron with one arm and a shaved head snarling at everybody of all the great films to come out of australia over the last 40 years and they pick this with profound apologies to trumbo steve jobs the danish girl and especially straight out of compton this is just piss poor entertainment politics come back doomsday all is forgiven
Jan 15 2016,negative,i missed the first 3 minutes of this movie and it did not make any difference  i think a documentary on the making of the movie would be more interesting than the actual movie was
Jan 15 2016,positive,now this is how you do a reboot
Jan 14 2016,positive,the best film of 2015 and maybe of the decade so far
Jan 14 2016,positive,along with american sniper the best movie of the year filled with action and just a fun movie to watch
Jan 14 2016,negative,beautiful cinematography however extremely boring and simple script most overrated movie in years
Jan 14 2016,negative,torture i honestly cannot fathom how someone could like this
Jan 14 2016,negative,shockingly bad particularly considering the attention its getting the characters are thin and barely have a believable moment the acting is good for the most part its the writing the dialogue and ultimately the directing the story arc is simple not necessarily a bad thing in an action movie but the actions of virtually every character is so far off the believability track it quickly becomes a jumbled mess the director was more obviously more interested in creating a visually stunning string of intense scenes than a good story  should have been cut down to a seven minute music video
Jan 14 2016,positive,awesome movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat or sofa
Jan 14 2016,positive,not exactly my full cup of tea but not a bad film is it deserving of an oscar nomination over others i dont think so however george miller does a great job with special effects and action scenes tom hardy is not bad but theron is the star of the film very well donebut not my favorite movie of 2015
Jan 14 2016,positive,rating this movie is hard for me because i completely dont get the whole mad max thing  i tried with the older movies since they were highly reviewed and was bored with them and tried the updated version after having it in my queue  for two months and was bored with it too  yes the visuals are fantastic charlize theron is fantastic of course but i just couldnt get past how shallow and silly the whole premise of it all is  sure there are some ironies there and as a popcorn flick for the masses it is not exactly difficult to follow i just cant do it and despite the manic action sequences i was bored and as soon as they said they were going all the way back to where they started i was out  i simply do not have the patience to go through all of that nonsense in reverse and could care less how it ended  i rate the story at like maybe a half star but gave it 3 because charlizes screen presence mixed with the high budget style and cgi is worthwhile just to look at despite the story line  i cant forget to mention nicholas hoult who has officially sealed his title as worlds most endearing zombie
Jan 14 2016,neutral,overrated and predictable
Jan 14 2016,negative,i cannot believe that this movie got any nominations  this was the worst movie i have seen in years
Jan 14 2016,positive,i watch  i repeat  i watch again
Jan 13 2016,positive,best mad max so far i think it would have been perfect if  mel gibson played max
Jan 13 2016,positive,violent disturbing weird and awesome  the stunts are amazing and most are done without special effects  better than any previous mad max  sorry mel
Jan 13 2016,neutral,quite a shock when i saw the super high rating for this movie yes there were spectacular locations and outstanding chase scenes but thats it bacially the movie was just one continuous chase scene wa explosion fest thrown in for good measure whats missing well a damn story for starters very weak at best with so little character development it left gaping holes in the whole escape from the tyrannical bad man scenario    another glaring omission was no australian actors this apocalyptic world of mad max is suppose to be in australia i guess the casting director went out for drink when these actors were chosen bad idea all american accents and no aussies maybe for this flick it didnt make much difference as there is so little dialog between actors and their weakass story nonstop chase scenes wgratuitous killing gets a bit stale wo a decent story to fillin under the thunderdome quality it aint there by a long shot   btw i am a big mad max fan but this reboot misses the mark for me
Jan 12 2016,positive,what a lovely day indeed this movie is everything the trailers made it look like it would be  a totally insane thrill ride roller coaster of a film from start to end    the film opens with revving car engines the perfect prelude to the smashing racing crashing action youre about to see the casting is pretty awesomely perfect and tom hardys demeanor fulls up the pages of script he doesnt talk through    a few big takeaways obviously the action and stunts were breathtaking if theres a film out there that makes a better case for practical stunts and effects i havent seen it everything in this movie is based around real explosions real crashes and the interaction with the physical environment therefore you end up with an incredible scale of thought and detail put into the reasons for everything and some pretty amazing visuals to accompany the story another thing is the extreme visualism with which george miller has brought back to mad max is absolutely stunning it creates amazing editing and action that is so in your face but at the same time easy to follow and understand finally the soundtrack almost never leaves and while loud and crazy sets its paces and sticks with the action incredibly well the movie is even selfaware about its music pairing it with a specific vehicle in the film that forces the viewer to be reminded about the music playing and brings it to light constantly but not so much as to distract    as with most theres also an incredible feminism empowerment plotline to the story that shines but doesnt feel forced theres just strong and powerful female characters that kick all the ass straight and simple theres no reason why or why not and thats what all movies and filmmakers should take as a huge lesson from fury road    definitely make a point to get to the theater for this one  a small screen will guaranteed not do the action justice ill be seeing it in imax next week which i would also recommend
Jan 12 2016,negative,the movie blows  ridiculous from jump street  i mean the guy playing the guitarcome on man
Jan 12 2016,positive,this movie is the fck awesome
Jan 12 2016,negative,not worth seeing did not finish watching
Jan 11 2016,positive,i loved this addition the best most well developed version of millers vision of the mad max world
Jan 11 2016,neutral,another mindless action movie but at least it has some visual flair
Jan 11 2016,positive,holland may not be as striking of a hero as  gibson but he carries the film with the help of other memorable characters the movie winds up feeling like one long chase which does get tiring eventually but the action is grand and things get rough fury road is a fun time with modern effects and techniques but it feels classy
Jan 11 2016,negative,overall this film was not good just a michael bay wanttobe big explosions but no real plot and no character development at all i was extremely surprised that it was nominated for best film at the golden globes  the film that should not be nominated for any awards  except for maybe special fx but for a film its laughable
Jan 11 2016,positive,this was epic great action good acting well directed highly entertaining one of my favorites of the year highly underadvertised by media my only critique is that some lines between actors were just dumb lol
Jan 11 2016,positive,it goes from intense to intense to intense to heartbreaking to intense to holy crap that is insane
Jan 11 2016,positive,mad max  problem with remakes its a been there done that great actors well done but not different enough
Jan 11 2016,positive,just one thing guitar freaking flame thrower
Jan 11 2016,negative,i saw about half of it and was not interested in more
Jan 11 2016,negative,the worst movie i have ever seen
Jan 10 2016,negative,honestlywhy i dont get it whats so good about this
Jan 10 2016,positive,a stunner but without the character depth of the road warrior is max in this one
Jan 10 2016,neutral,was really interested to watch the so hyped mad max movie it started well but went surprisingly downhill really fast just couldnt watch past the chase scene where the albinoweirdo stands on a fasttraveling car playing a fire guitar
Jan 10 2016,negative,amazing set costumes propsvisually interesting except for the crappy acting and it being stupidreally stupid  how this has 97 on rotten tomatoes is beyond comprehension  video game steampunk comiccon nerds
Jan 10 2016,negative,while the art direction is detailed and beautiful after an hour i was so bored i turned it off  i dont know enough about making movies to know why i loved mm 2 and 3 never cared for 1  it isnt the actors its just slow and dull
Jan 10 2016,positive,great movie george miller is a genius its good to know that their is still a great director that can bring the intense action scenes without completely using a green screen hope this story keeps going because i cant seem to get enough of the mad max series especially this one wow 
Jan 9 2016,positive,excellently staged and directed mad max fury road is a highoctane action extravaganza that delivers and then some
Jan 9 2016,positive,arclight sherman oaks  may 2015 with steph kadin and natalie
Jan 9 2016,positive,i guess they left the citadel unguarded whod have thought
Jan 9 2016,negative,absolutely the stupidest movie ive ever seen in my life 2 hours of the same monotonous garbage with no plot dont waste your time
Jan 9 2016,negative,the dumbest movie ive ever seen idiotic
Jan 9 2016,neutral,ive been hearing how great this movie is since it came out a lot of critics placed it on their top 10 lists to be sure this is one impressive movie to look at one so full of action its almost exhausting what it lacks for me is a story that makes sense none of the characters resonate i would have loved this one as a teenager lots of mindless action i mean a heavy metal guitar playing nut job on the grill of one of the trucks im in the minority here though guess i just dont get the mad max story
Jan 9 2016,positive,with great action visual storytelling and little to no dialogue but easy to understand mad max fury road comes at a time where every movie is dependent on cgi and mad max decides to use little to no cgi in the movie and instead use practical effects
Jan 9 2016,positive,might be my new desert island movie
Jan 9 2016,positive,this is what happens when you have a visionary filmmaker with an idea in his head for 30 years a film so energetic so welloiled and with a story that moves along faster than maxs own interceptor that you just want to keep going back in over and over again once its finished the first thing i love about it is millers direction he almost completely does away with the shakycam fight scenes of recent action films and now finally we have someone who knows when to employ what technique when to use slow motion or when to go fast motion when to cut to maintain suspension of disbelief but also to keep the viewers understanding of the scene and all its players intact miller also accomplishes something extraordinary with the characters of the film  here we have fully fleshed out three dimensional characters but with barely a word of dialogue characters are developed as we see the world they live in we feel for nux because at the start he is just cannon fodder unremarkable when standing next to the other warboys a surprisingly easy thing to relate to in the real world we feel for furiosa because she has made it through so many implied hardships and has come out fighting on the other side the character of max is already developed fully through the canon of the original films but miller recreates this character by showing us his past through his fevered hallucinations so the film works as a standalone piece as well as a part of the canon something else this film has received noteworthy praise for is its female leads and personally i have yet to see a film do this as well as this one does yes the female characters in this film are in the foreground and are all holding their own with the men but it never addresses this it just lets them do their thing almost as if  could it be possible  woman can be proactive too
Jan 9 2016,positive,what a lovely movie nux so this movie has everything that i expected crazy explosions intense action and it was one of the best movies of 2015 i had one problem with the movie and that was not much story or depth of the apocalyptic world but it did one thing that was great character development and i ended up loving this movie and its characters rate 8510
Jan 9 2016,positive,visuals and amazing energy asidei just dont get the love for this
Jan 8 2016,positive,wow what a amazing movie the action are fuckly awesome and the sound track make you cry instantly
Jan 8 2016,negative,awful bastardization of the franchise tom hardy actually does a decent job but it not allowed to run with it as charlize therons character takes over we were promised a film spanning the time between mad max  road warrior instead we got a remake of road warrior mothers milk really what was miller thinking
Jan 8 2016,positive,mad max is nonstop nitroinjected actionmovie glory nobody is making movies like this and i doubt anyone ever will with such success like the hunt for resources in the vast barren world of george millers imagination youll truly have to scavenge for a single pothole on the fury road
Jan 7 2016,positive,visually stunning but the storyline lacks depth
Jan 7 2016,positive,my favorite film of 2015 hands down better than star wars star wars was 2nd place for me
Jan 7 2016,positive,this movie had good acting and was just fun to watch  tom hardy did a great job of making mad max his and keeping to mel gibsons version
Jan 6 2016,positive,best flick of the year
Jan 6 2016,positive,this was a good revival of the mad max series the chase scenes were top notch and the ending fit perfectly
Jan 6 2016,positive,this is the first mad max film i have watched sure ive seen clips from the earlier ones but it never grabbed me  if it was not for several friends telling me about the antipatriarchy themes i may have passed over this one as well i am glad that i did not   i watched it originally in the theater a week or two into its release and i knew that it would easily be one of my favorite films of the year especially considering how few new films i watch in their year of release     the bottom line is that the story is more important than the vehicle it is an incredible action film and marrying the story with the action is important and its main strength but i am suggesting that the actionchase movie is could be bigger there is little time spent on building relationships between the characters and the viewer now is a good time to remember that i prefer drama films so this could be the perfect feminist action film and i may not recognize how perfect it is    i waited to watch it a second time because i wanted to have a better sound system which i now have the first time one of the diesel engine turns over it sounded perfect and then i turned the base down i could feel the nails shaking loose    mad max fury road is an important movie and should be enjoyed
Jan 5 2016,negative,what a waste of 2 hours of my life
Jan 5 2016,positive,while maybe not quite my genre i honestly havent had a theater experience quite as incredible as mad max since i saw avatar in imax  crazy breathtaking action
Jan 5 2016,positive,easily one of the best action films of this generation its been too long since we have seen a real action movie it is totally worth buying it on blue ray lastly my favorite movie of 2015      i give my personal rating of 10 lovely days out of 10
Jan 5 2016,positive,its a mad max movie and it executes it perfectly its fast paced and will have you begging for more but it still has the decency to let you breathe here and there i have seen this movie many times and i know its going to age very well
Jan 5 2016,positive,millers playground of brutal beauty is an intense rush shame it couldnt stop for a second to deepen its lore
Jan 5 2016,positive,a thrill ride from start to finish    mad max fury road thrives on its nonstop suspensefilled action sequences
Jan 4 2016,positive,masterpiece is all that need to be said
Jan 4 2016,positive,mad max fury road miller 2015 thats 2 hours of absolute vicious entertainment and visual marvel 1010
Jan 4 2016,positive,great movie full of action very intense love it
Jan 4 2016,positive,found myself getting a bit bored very little plot looked brilliant though nice to see charlize being badass loved the guitar man on the front of the big rig
Jan 3 2016,positive,really not sure what all the fuss is about for this movie found it boring as it simply is a 2 hour vehicle chase
Jan 3 2016,positive,this movie was one of the best hard action movies of all time yes very entertaining but never failing to teach lessons on issues such as global warming depleting world resources greed exploitation and poverty religion roles of women ect the movie itself was physically creative and original it was a road traveled with constant anxiety and wonder with pleasing surprises and although it barely reaches emotional it is unforgettable
Jan 3 2016,positive,personal favorite of 2015
Jan 3 2016,positive,this film is so good that it brings to life the age old question if there were something wrong with it would anybody care
Jan 3 2016,positive,george miller you a genius what an amazing film as the yanks would say awesome
Jan 3 2016,negative,error 404 not found a story 
Jan 2 2016,positive,greatest film of 2015 and deserves a watch it is action packed for the whole movie and keeps you on the edge of your seat a movie with nearly no dialogue is in my opinion the best movie of the year also with all the practical effects makes some damn interesting film making everyone should see this well directed and well captured film
Jan 2 2016,positive,there has been talk of george miller returning the postapocalyptic wasteland of max rockatansky for quite some time it seemed unlikely that the director now known for such familyfriendly fare as babe and happy feet would decide to revisit the world he created with the first mel gibson as mad max back in 1979 so i was surprised when miller decided to direct another installment with tom hardy taking on the role gibson played in the first three films hardy is an excellent choice he is good actor and has a great physical presence and can suffer photogenically like mel did especially in the road warrior but max is almost a secondary character in this film charlize theron plays imperator furiosa whose rebellious act stealing the brides of immortan joe played by hugh keaysbyrne who played the toecuter back in the first mad max film missing an arm thanks to cgi and with her hair cut surprisingly short the deglamorized theron is just as riveting and physical in her performance as hardy  the first half of the film is a chase and second half is a race and yes there is a surprising feminist subtext to the film as well as a notsosurprising environmental subtext to this film
Jan 2 2016,positive,its cool and really fun and the performances were really good too it felt like a perfect film incarnation of an 80s comic book which was really interesting
Jan 2 2016,positive,mad max fury road came out of nowhere and was a fun exhilarating joy ride throughout the entire film  when the soundtrack booms on as exciting action plays you cant help but feel adrenaline rushing through your veins  everything was great about it but if it had more of a story it would be perfect
Jan 2 2016,positive,this is an action masterpiece from its narrative to its stunt work to its performances  it is over the top incredible action with a plot to back it up  one of the best actions movies ever
Jan 2 2016,positive,im not quite as enthralled with it as most of the top critics but kudos to george miller for making such a lively ambitious flick at a advanced age
Jan 2 2016,positive,im a victim of not having seen any mad max films prior to fury road i mean theyre way before my time and frankly anything that has to do with mel gibson doesnt have the same touch as it did before with that said this movie melted my face off its a hardcore postapocalyptic nightmare that blends beautiful direction with breathtaking cinematography to birth a heartpounding experience the titular character acts as a passenger to a brutal narrative involvingwellfire water and blood surely not to be missed quite possibly the best movie of 2015
Jan 1 2016,neutral,very overrated its definitely a unique visual feast but its so light on character development story and plot i was just bored after an hour and craving it to be over i know im in the minority on this one but im just fine with that
Jan 1 2016,negative,please  lets go back to mel and a good movie
Jan 1 2016,positive,an action orchestra
Jan 1 2016,positive,easily the best action movie in years
Jan 1 2016,positive,55  everything i wanted out of mad max film and so much more  the best film in a fantastic series
Jan 1 2016,negative,from a considerable distance i can see how there may be more here than a two hour mercilessly barbaric chase through the video game fantasies of a twentysomething misanthrope but said distance is probably cleveland
Jan 1 2016,positive,b this is a very good action movie i dont get people going all gaga over it and declaring it best picture you know what though were all beautiful and unique flowers and i respect everybodys opinion almost
Jan 1 2016,negative,why everyone loves this movie is beyond me   i found it almost unwatchable and grit my teeth through it only because of my love for the original trilogy
Jan 1 2016,negative,simply awful thoughtless violence and bizarre piles of old car bodies on top of monster trucks aimed at 7 year old boys so far as i can tell
Jan 1 2016,positive,the first mad max film i have seen it was phenomenal action packed with brutal violence and display of a post apocalyptic world thrilling all the way through it sparked my interest in the franchise causing me to see the other movies while enjoyable this film captured the title as one of my favorite action movies i recommend this to anyone in search of a film with brutality on the scale of mad max fury road
Jan 1 2016,positive,its an over the top adrenaline rush completely unlike anything you have ever seen before i just wish the story was stronger based on all other elements being in top form
Jan 1 2016,neutral,really didnt get what all the fuss was about
Jan 1 2016,negative,worst film of the year by far
Jan 1 2016,positive,intense over the top one hell of movie experience get acting and directing overall only missing mel cameo
Jan 1 2016,negative,97 certified fresh rating are you serious visuals are good not great cinematography is nice  i cant even say this film had to be acted all that well because its secondary to the action sequences and maxes grunts which i guess is also part of the action cause it definitely isnt part of the dialogue  having charlize didnt hurt  no story  a mind numbing ride without too much effort required by any of the actors to portray anything other than shock fear  dismay and hope  well at least i am able to narrow down my list of potential critics to follow from 333 to 10  abysmal
Jan 1 2016,negative,tedious repetitive boring
Jan 1 2016,positive,this was by far the most crazy action film i have ever seen miller at 70 can nail such stuff razzle dazzle what a lovely day indeed
Jan 1 2016,positive,this is what happens when you have a visionary filmmaker with an idea in his head for 30 years a film so energetic so welloiled and with a story that moves along faster than maxs own interceptor that you just want to keep going back in over and over again once its finished the first thing i love about it is millers direction he almost completely does away with the shakycam fight scenes of recent action films and now finally we have someone who knows when to employ what technique when to use slow motion or when to go fast motion when to cut to maintain suspension of disbelief but also to keep the viewers understanding of the scene and all its players intact miller also accomplishes something extraordinary with the characters of the film  here we have fully fleshed out three dimensional characters but with barely a word of dialogue characters are developed as we see the world they live in we feel for nux because at the start he is just cannon fodder unremarkable when standing next to the other warboys a surprisingly easy thing to relate to in the real world we feel for furiosa because she has made it through so many implied hardships and has come out fighting on the other side the character of max is already developed fully through the canon of the original films but miller recreates this character by showing us his past through his fevered hallucinations so the film works as a standalone piece as well as a part of the canon something else this film has received noteworthy praise for is its female leads and personally i have yet to see a film do this as well as this one does yes the female characters in this film are in the foreground and are all holding their own with the men but it never addresses this it just lets them do their thing almost as if  could it be possible  woman can be proactive too
Dec 31 2015,negative,terrible dont waste your time
Dec 31 2015,negative,theres a rule in the advertising world if you dont understand the ad then it wasnt meant for you i believe this applies to movies as well mad max fury road is 120 minutes of pure chaos and action its well acted well produced and quite disturbing i just cant help but think why was this movie made perhaps there is a story worth telling buried deep beneath the action if so it was lost on me
Dec 31 2015,positive,with intriguing characters bombastic action and its insane apocalyptic world generated by the mind of george miller mad max fury road is a wild adrenalinefueled cinematic experience that sets the bar for modern action films of this decade
Dec 31 2015,positive,i finally got to watch this much hyped and praised action flick after six months of being released and i liked it i was expecting the second coming of christ and all i got was a fun action movie that plays it safe on narration but puts some of the best practical stunts on screen i guess im supposed to let the paper thin characters and weak villain pass i can do that
Dec 31 2015,positive,tom hardy works well with charlize theron to create a truly brilliant masterpiece of action
Dec 31 2015,positive,gorgeous and gritty it takes the mad max franchise into the next gear
Dec 31 2015,positive,oh what a movie what a lovely movie   best viewed in the widest screen possible in the biggest bad ass speakers you can find at full blast it will take you to an adrenaline filled journey orchestrated by a visionary conductordirector with strong doses of humour and poetry alike  stunts costumes and cinematography are out of this world if there is one action story to watch this year this is definitely it
Dec 31 2015,negative,that was surprisingly boring
Dec 30 2015,negative,this movie was not what i expected it is very hard to look at because its very predictable and filmmakers should not be seen during scenes not necessarily an edge of your seat film
Dec 30 2015,positive,as a fan of the original mad max trilogy i was hesitant to watch this one as there was an american input to an australian classic but realizing george miller was at the helm i gave in and was happy i did tom hardy did the role justice but wasnt as good as mel gibson and unlike most of the other reviewers i wasnt overly impressed with theron the hit is george millers vision of what an action movie should be so i can recommend this one to all mad max fans
Dec 30 2015,positive,simply standing ovation
Dec 30 2015,negative,i am missing something in this movie  i could barely finish it
Dec 30 2015,positive,the surprise smash hit of 2015 mad max fury road is a sequelreboot to george millers mad max 1979 whats strange about miller is that apart from his mad max franchise his biggest accomplishments have been writing both babe and happy feet very peculiar then that from the same director comes literally the most action packed film of the last decade unfortunately however this very strength becomes its greatest weakness    whilst visually stunning there is barely a narrative driving the action foreword the story goes that in a post apocalyptic wasteland where chrome and oil are worshipped and water is in short supply imperator furiosa charlize theron decides to run away from immortal joe the man in charge of said chrome oil and water taking all of his wives with her thats essentially it what follows next is a two hour long car chase somehow this max character tom hardy tags along for the ride and apart from being able to drive in a straight line and being nifty with a wrench doesnt really add much    therons furiosa is amazingly badass and the only really likeable character its worth mentioning that its great to see a strong female lead in an action film such as this hardys max on the other hand barely says ten words and doesnt really feel justified as the titular character nicholas hoult gives an unrecognisable performance as nux a young war boy but any real hope of a character arc for him and nearly all characters is sacrificed in place of crane cam shots of exploding vehicles    the mostly practical visual effects are amazing to behold and miller should be applauded for his return to physical effects and sparse use of green screen its visually stunning but only remains interesting for so long coming in at exactly two hours it felt at least half an hour too long when max and friends finally escape their pursuers i thought it was over and the perfect ending point however this was not the case they make the decision to return through the desert from where they came to confront their captor at this point i felt cheated not only were all the previous car chases pointless now there was to be another half hour of exactly the same    fury road is an amazing technical achievement and should be recognised as such but unfortunately in order to uphold this narrative and character development are sacrificed
Dec 30 2015,positive,excellent lots of action
Dec 29 2015,positive,15 year old production hiatus drastic changes in shooting locations cast revamp the fact that mad max fury road the 4th installment of a long forgotten but highly revered franchise was made braving all these odds is nothing short of an incredible event in the recent movie history and oh yes its a sight to behold  fury road takes us back to the arid dystopia which auteur george miller introduced about 35 years ago only now miller has upped his game by several notches thanks to the massive  150 mn budget and creative freedom conferred on the creators by the studio  landscapes are brighter  more dreadful vehicles bigger and more revved up the mad madder enter immortan joe a ghoulish dictatorselfproclaimed messiah who has taken over an entire citadel by stealing its water supply  under his wing is an army of ailing  skinheads called the war boys who have been promised slots in valhalla in exchange for suicidal fanaticism towards joe and his ideas  this works very well given the downcast society where everyone is looking for redemption  status quo turns into bedlam when joes army imperator furiosa played by the dazzling charlize theron goes rogue after stealing joes most prized possessions his wives during a supply run what ensues is a long exhilarating chase sequence between furiosa and joe accompanied by his army of white minions thrown in the midst of all this chaos is max rockitanksy who is picked as a human power cell by nux a starry eyed war boy for his pursuit on fury road while max was rigged with ample gadgetry in the previous movies he is stripped down to one single instinct that of survival the famous interceptor is shredded between two giant trucks in one of the scenes  against will he is forced to help furiosa and the wives flee to a safe haven called the green place lean plot yes shallow definitely not  amidst all the edge of the seat action sequences it is easy to miss the subtexts which the writers have carefully interlaced with the main story line while the original script was slated as one long chase sequence it became denser with time like a bottle of aging wine furiosas missing arm the elephant in the room freakish figures scavenging swamps maxs strange time hopping visions might all be part of a bigger universe whose surface was merely grazed in fury road we will have to wait for the promised sequels to watch these elements unfold yes there are more movies in line  at the helm of the movie is a mastermind who has crafted his art of direction over years while he might be pretty inconsistent in making movies george millers devotion and bravura puts most his younger contemporaries to shame millers uses his outlandish creativity and visceral filmmaking style to make some of the most unforgettable action sequences ever made oscar winning cinematographer john seale the english patient who came out of retirement for the project delivers with some stunning shots of namibian desert the art direction and production design are equally stellar be it the adorable tumors on nuxs neck  the super cool skeleton engraving on the war rigs door or suave interiors of immortals elysium  the amount of detail that has gone into each character vehicle or set piece is simply staggering check out the vehicle gallery on the official movie to know what im talking about it would be a sin not to mention margaret sixel who puts her editing skills to to make the entire movie look like one long thrilling chase sequence  junkie xls operatic score works as a perfect complement to the mood of the movie     but the real stars of the movie in my opinion is its stunt crew it is incredible and admirable how these guys pulled off a majority of death defying jaw dropping and plain batshit crazy stunts with real people and real vehicles instead of doing it the easy way war boys polecats flamers would all have stayed as concepts had it not been for their raw calculated gutsiness  my adulation goes for the entire stunt team  this is analog movie making at its best if you didnt see this on the biggest loudest screen you definitely missed something  one of the biggest surprises of fury road was how the movie was not about max but furiosa a warrior equally or more broken than the titular character we see what you did there with the deceiving trailers wb deeply conflicted and often poignant she tries to bring sense to a mad society played flawlessly by charlize theron furiosa is easily one of the strongest female characters to emerge out of an action flick she is definitely among the ranks of ellen ripley sarah conor and likes replacing mel gibson is a more reticent feral tom hardy who gets the job done but becomes subdued by furiosas intense screen charisma nicholas hoult also puts a heartfelt performance as nux a rather demure war boy and hugh kayes byrne as the nefarious yet graceful antagonist     against all the praises i have heard some strong criticisms about the apparent feminist undertones of the story but i wonder does it really matter at heart fury road is a straight up action flick with beautifully choreographed stunts minimal dialogues strong characters and a seemingly linear storyline there is no subtle way to put it fury road is every adrenaline junkies dream come true if road warrior is the punks sistine chapel fury road is summer action flicks holy grail 
Dec 29 2015,negative,the plot is    heros drive in one direction for an hour and a half    decides to drive back    thats it thats the movie
Dec 29 2015,positive,insanely fun super hardcore action movie that is a phenomenal popcorn flick and gets the adrenaline pumping
Dec 29 2015,positive,to let you know i had not watched the original mad max movies when i had watched this film so my judgment comes from the film on its own basis and using that fact i must saw that george miller does a good job as far as the cinematography of it john seale the cinematographer does a exceptional job here there are many shots of the film that feel like the belong here john seale also did some of the harry potter movies were he also did a great job in the action is directed to perfection and left me in awe struck at the amount of time and special effects put into this film with no cgi being added to boggle it down     as for characters tom hardy is good as max he hardly says a word and i really love that when watching the film i loved that he was all about action and doing stuff and not so much about talking because a lot of times in the movies just your facial expressions can say so much about a scene and tom hardy was no exception the fact of the matter is that he was undoubtedly max     now charlize theron i adored as furiosa she was what won the movie for me and made it awesome i still remember after seeing this film the first thing i thought was dam she could be a great wonder woman i mean seriously forget gal godat and get charlize to play diana and bet i would love it along with everyone else i mean the woman really does lead these women from the terrible and crooked husband     nicholas hoult and hugh keaysbyrne sadly were not as good or interesting i mean they were just raging fits of anger they didnt think and they had no brain i mean really they were not compelling villains at all in fact i found myself quite bored with them to the point were it didnt make any sense     now with that being said i am going into all the problems with this film     the lack of story while there were interesting characters it lacked any type of good characters which hinders the film quite a bit for me cause i do like a good story that being said there is some story here unlike what people are saying it just takes some time to get to it    the entire first 20 mins were boring i mean at first i was into it but it felt like the action sequence would just keep going and going and honestly if it wasnt for my desire to finish my food i probably would have gone to sleep not good movie not good at all     the villains suck no really they do there bad and awful villains to the point were i wanted them all dead  ok now that the issues are out the way the film is still decent enough i wont be recommending it to anyone probably unless there just really into action films tho still tho there is a lot that we can still love with mad max fury road which is why i am still giving it a 710
Dec 29 2015,positive,the best action movie
Dec 29 2015,positive,easily my favorite movie of the year possibly my favorite movie ever
Dec 29 2015,positive,best action film of 2015
Dec 28 2015,negative,slap postapocalyptic on anything and it becomes interesting that was clearly the intent with mad max fury road    there was barely any story involved this coupled with what appeared to be b grade stunts along with sporadic visual effects the new mad max can definitely be skipped altogether    however charlize therons performance must be recognized in this movie which was excellent
Dec 28 2015,positive,8675 out of 100 a
Dec 28 2015,positive,mad max fury road is the best action movie ive ever seen george miller returns after 3 decades to continue the saga mad max and his return is glorious and epic in every sense   the style of the original trilogy is respected and used the same formula but with better effects and best choreography the action scenes are amazing it was a pleasure to see some sequences well made and very well edited in postproduction tom hardy is such a good max as mel gibson and the fans will be very satisfied with the final result literally this is the first film that of truth the 2 hours of film are 2 hours of pure action exciting violent and frantic the climax never drops the story never becomes loose   i repeat is the best action movie ive ever seen in a long time applause to the whole team and in particular to the director george miller    review en español  mad max fury road es la mejor película de acción que jamas he visto george miller regresa después de 3 décadas para continuar con la saga mad max y su retorno es glorioso y épico en todo sentido el estilo de la trilogía original es respetada y se usa la misma formula pero con mejores efectos y mejor coreografía las escenas de acción son increíbles fue un placer ver unas secuencias bien hechas y muy bien editadas en postproducción tom hardy es tan buen max como mel gibson y los fans estarán muy satisfechos con el resultado final literalmente esta es la primera película que de verdad las 2 horas de película son 2 horas de acción pura emocionante violenta y frenética el clímax nunca cae la historia nunca se vuelve floja    repito   es la mejor pelicular de acción que he visto en mucho tiempo aplausos a todo el equipo en especial al director george miller
Dec 28 2015,positive,a sort of mad max 2 deconstructed in which the final half hour from mm2 is replayed and then replayed again theres a lot that can be said about the lack of plot and characterisation  as in there isnt any  and it does make you appreciate how good mel gibson was as max hardy is a blank space  its not even his film its therons but the action is totally nail biting so very watchable great if you want action and little else
Dec 28 2015,positive,an in your face nonstop action film that excels in cinematography and style even mild action fans will be thoroughly entertained b
Dec 27 2015,positive,finally got a chance this film  it rocks  i see the film as a metaphor for the struggles women experience in what is largely a male dominated society and charlize theron is absolutely badass as the main character  max much like the audience is along for the ride
Dec 27 2015,negative,not as good as the original but ok at best
Dec 27 2015,positive,i liked that the movie was about furiosa not max furiosa in particular seemed a rich character well i guess thats what you get when you actually have a talented actor at work tom hardy who i like very much had a hard time stepping out of the shadow of older maxes who shall not be named yet held my attention well but  1 it seemed that f  m were a perfect match why didnt they actually hit it off  2 the ritual of the culture was way overdone theres value in ritual especially for primitive cultures like that into which civilization had devolved in the movie but beyond a certain point ritual becomes a survival risk  3 why didnt furiosa speak aussie  4 no reason is given for max leaving except that max always leaves honestly couldnt something have been done with that why cant max finally find something that can make up even just a bit for the loss of his family
Dec 27 2015,positive,mad max fury road is a finely tuned visually insane and relentlessly kinetic action thriller that brings george millers surprisingly thorough fictional world roaring to life
Dec 27 2015,positive,so really now thats the film of the year i wonder what the worst film would be like
Dec 26 2015,positive,best movie of 2015 this is an insane non stop action frenzy tom hardy is great as max the vehicle sequences are out of this world and the story is also a pretty damn good one this movie very well could win multiple oscars for its amazing visuals
Dec 26 2015,positive,mad max fury road pros fantastic acting outstanding directing superb writing striking cinematography magnificent editing brilliant pacing amazing balance between thrilling action scenes and sublime storytelling and character development phenomenal musical score terrific set and costume design strong sound mixing  sound editing cons none overall grade a 1010
Dec 26 2015,positive,frenetic furious fantastic felt like a 4 hour movie but not in a peter jackson king kong sort of way worth the watch exhausting
Dec 26 2015,positive,mad max fury road is maybe the best reboot of all time the lack of plot and character development is out shined by marvelous action and visual effects
Dec 26 2015,positive,action filmmaking at its finest
Dec 26 2015,positive,this one of the best action movies ever made
Dec 26 2015,positive,wowstill trying to process everything i just saw  pretty sure there were a few scenes i didnt even blink because so much insane stuff was happening all at once  did i understand everything that was going on  not reallybut at least it looked pretty  funny thing is mad max really feels like hes barely in the movie but you wont even care because charlize theron is really the star of the movie and she kills it
Dec 26 2015,negative,what a pile of manure
Dec 25 2015,positive,benchmark of action movie
Dec 25 2015,positive,being someone who never saw the previous mad maxs i had no bias or nostalgia with very little dialogue or effort from the character whose name is in the title  mad mad is carried by those who do speak and the amazing car chase scenes littered throughout
Dec 25 2015,positive,although very very simplistic on the story side of things  with a plot revolving around the protagonists attempts to escape the citadel before deciding to go back  mad max fury road excels on every other front with brilliant visual and practical effects tons of creative imagery engaging characters great acting pulsepounding music and exhilarating action fury road is a thrilling cinematic experience
Dec 25 2015,positive,im not a gore for gores sake kind of viewer but being old school mad max back in the day was one of the goriest movies out there this mad max really doesnt have a drop of blood in it a lot of crash boom bam but nothing really at stake if you are expecting to see the old gritty hardcore mad max where death rape and dismemberment are just around the corner you are not going to find it here if you want another homogenized 21st century   type action film its worth a look
Dec 25 2015,negative,horrible movie so overrated u will want to kill yourself after watching this shit
Dec 24 2015,positive,a combination of outstanding visuals action and an engaging story the stunt work is amazing tom hardy and charlize theron mostly only have to be grim the supporting cast are tops this one tops all of the previous in the series
Dec 24 2015,negative,i want the hours of my life back bad story no dialoguestupid effects dont waste your time
Dec 24 2015,positive,an flawless movie but is it better than road warrior less of max and more of furiosa not that i complain
Dec 24 2015,positive,george miller unleashes a feverish ferocious film and its an intense wild ride      acrobatic mad max fury road is thrilling and treats the audience to some astonishing action sequences  but the action doesnt dull the emotional impact and thats mainly due to charlize therons fierce performance    mad max fury road is a ride worth taking  walltowall pumpedup adrenalized fun its ridiculously good
Dec 23 2015,negative,the acting was fine the special effects were fine the fighting and crashing were fine  if there was a story inside the running away then turning around to attack the very place they were running from i completely missed it if that was the story how silly
Dec 23 2015,positive,475 stars  what a lovely day  this movie was awesome  very cool story over the top action sequences and an awesome aesthetic  very anxious to see what george miller has in store for us next  the only knock is it had more cgi than i was expecting but still awesome nonetheless  i highly recommend this one
Dec 23 2015,negative,no no no no    not about mad max its about car chases glorious exploding no cgi car chases but thats it plot  no acting  barely those horrible movie tropes  yup mumbled and dull dialogue  yup    people be crazy
Dec 23 2015,positive,great action great acting great story  first three films should have been referred to either in narrative or in character interactions to strengthen life of settingenvironment
Dec 22 2015,positive,for two hours i watched this film with awe and admiration    complaints    1 i could never get the colors right  reds are excessively red  yeah its intentional  however if my color settings work for every other video why should i need to make major adjustments without ultimate satisfaction for this film    2 as i watch this film i feel like im playing the rpg dungeon quest  the story is on a rail  to accomplish an uncompleted quest we must go back the exact same way that we came  not much thought involved  not much freedom to explore the map  just action on a rail
Dec 22 2015,positive,this is a masterpiece it deserves every oscar available arguably the greatest action movie of all time i guess you can say i liked it
Dec 22 2015,positive,one of the most awaited films this year ive seen the old film series lately as a warm up and they where quite good to be honest    this film is even more intense and filled with effects and actions you get some breaks from the action and the pretty good story makes it whole the actors are solid but again  this is all about the action i really dug that guitarist  funny clever and original    8 out of 10 sips of mothers milk
Dec 22 2015,positive,there is no question this thoroughly modern max is an extremely entertaining synthesis of mess and noise  the antidote to the onslaught of comic book superheroes and vigilantes of the last few years was antihero max or so we thought   director george miller subverted all our expectations of this film from tweaking the gender roles in action films to astronomical production aesthetics few directors have the tenacity to unleash the kind of physical carnage miller splashes across the screen here youll barely have a second to breathe as he seamlessly shifts from one insane set piece to another ratcheting up the stakes and assembling his meticulous symphony of carnage with the combined result being one of the most successfully ambitious action extravaganzas committed to film
Dec 22 2015,positive,having never seen a mad max film in its entirety i know and having heard of its strangeness as someone put it i went into mad max fury road a little well unsure but suffice to say it was good very good     the first 20 minutes or so are to be frank the weakest part of the movie its slow somewhat uninteresting and as a newcomer its admittedly a little hard to get on board with the madness pun not intended but as the movie progresses um yeah so    the action is sensational this is one of the best action movies ive seen and its weird how one and a half hours of action can greatly sustain your interest  tom hardy as max was brilliant and so was charlize theron as furiosa and the setting was prettey sublime there were a few things that bothered me though one was that nicholas hoults character whilst a great character had a romance with some girl which blossomed in about 3 minutes and im not even exaggerating    also there was admittedly a lot of screaming and nothingness in terms of plot but honestly by the time the film concluded i had the biggest happiest grin on my face in a long while
Dec 21 2015,positive,a must see for any action junkie not much story line but it doesnt need one just flat out cool
Dec 21 2015,negative,so boring nothing much happens its just carchase action nonstop
Dec 21 2015,positive,believe the hype max is back and hes kicking ass while tom hardy isnt quite as good at being mad max as mel gibson was srsly gibson is a raging bigot hes already mad he has the look and his terse acting actually helps him sell his traumatized road warrior persona charlize theron is the woman of the hour as furiosa a badass warrior woman out to redeem herself the plot begins with max being captured and furiosa making off with some precious goods that immortan joe the ruler of the citadel cant let slip away max is serving as a blood bag for nux a warboy with terminal cancer nux figures chasing down furiosa is his last chance at immortal glory so he drags max along for the ride thus the chase begins    every character cast for this film is pretty much perfection if you remember the bizarre characters from road warrior youll recognize similar horrors and mutants here the world is dead and irradiated so theres plenty of twisted creations all around the gangs themselves are all very welldefined as are their leaders i loved the guntown dudes vehicle the music is fantastic and the environments are legit video gamequality otherworldly the storm sequence and the swamp were particularly awesome the action as a whole puts the end chase in road warrior to absolute shame which is a tall order but one that fury road fulfills    my only issues with the movie were that the 3d stuff was overdone the movie should have been an hour longer i still prefer 3hour movies for films that aspire to real art and some leaps in logic apparently everyone in the postapocalypse has the same blood type but those things aside fury road is well worth the price of admission action movies will be compared to this for a long time to come
Dec 20 2015,positive,some may complain that there is a lack of story but the story is told without words this movie is stellar beginning to end
Dec 20 2015,positive,overhyped though quite the thrill
Dec 20 2015,positive,this is the action movie of the year
Dec 20 2015,positive,well made but meaningful visual style and totally collapsing story together with average actors performance that feeling when every time you are in one step from catch the fish but each time it swim away 610
Dec 20 2015,positive,first the positives theron and hardy were magnificient and was rightly cast for this movie the stunts were amazing as well as the cgi not a dull moment really the movie kept a good pace and 2 hrs flew by    now those are what makes this bearable if you can get past the ridiculous story ridiculous premise etc to be honest perhaps it is a cultural thing as an asian i just cant seem to understand why would anyone think up of such a ridiculous postapocalyptic future perhaps this is what happens to white men when the world goes awry    edit i changed this from 2 stars to 45 after watching it a couple more times i think it really is about getting past the premise this is not meant to be a serious film just an action packed science fiction also reading up on more of the prestories helped understand a lot of misconceptions in the film
Dec 19 2015,positive,nov 1 2015    orchard hill    michael bredeweg  scott biggerstaff
Dec 19 2015,positive,such an incredible movie im going to go and say its definitely by far the best one of the franchise charlize theron is the show stealer with tom hardy being fantastic in the title role
Dec 19 2015,positive,haha i wasnt sure what to expect with that movie charlize theron is fantastic in her role
Dec 19 2015,positive,theron was so passionatean excitement finally
Dec 19 2015,positive,everyhing i wanted in mad max movie
Dec 18 2015,positive,george millers mad max fury road is one of the most lush and vivid movies ive seen in a long time the cinematography for this film is an absolute marvel showcasing the sprawling outback desert through hues of oranges and reds during the daytime contrasting it with beautiful midnight blues at night all this comes together to give the movie a very lively atmosphere the score alleviates the sense of rush and is smartly used diegetically as well as nondiegetically the action scenes are shot brilliantly with minimal special effect furthering its case as a masterpiece finally the acting especially that of charlize theron as imperator furiosa is topnotch and no character is left needing further characterisation tom hardys max is a man of little words but the performances are so strong that the movie doesnt need dialogue in order to flourish this movie is definitely not hyped up go see it and then go see it again  rating 55
Dec 18 2015,positive,a glorious cacophony of action and noise underscored by nuanced performances that help tell and sell the story without words
Dec 18 2015,positive,a high octane adrenaline filled exhilarating ride of a movie which you cant help but enjoy
Dec 17 2015,positive,just totally awesome
Dec 17 2015,negative,a 90 min chase scene  a redux of the road warrior  36
Dec 17 2015,positive,im going to say this now it might be the greatest action ever made even if tom hardy is criminally underused
Dec 17 2015,negative,97 you guys must of been watching a different movie from me this movie is horrible
Dec 16 2015,positive,george miller burst onto the cinematic landscape in 1979 with the 70s exploitation car chase masterpiece mad max then exceeded the brilliance of that debut with a sequel mad max 2 that truly cemented him as a visionary and visceral filmmaker now almost thirtyfive years later miller demonstrates with mad max fury road that hes lost none of his vitality however where previously the thinness of plot and character felt appropriate in this franchise here they read as omission and highlight the fact that at the end of the day this is little more than a wellexecuted twohour car chase    furiosa charlize theron is the true hero of this story despite living in the aggressively patriarchal society of the citadel ruled by immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne she has attained a position of some authority when she sets out on a trade mission she takes with her a group of immortans breeders with the intention of seeking refuge in a remote society of women max tom hardy spends the first half hour of the film held captive as a human blood bag for one of immortans goons until he escapes and teams up with furiosa    millers strong point is the detail with which he paints his world the colours the costumes the makeup the souped up vehicles the daredevil stunts the magnificent collisions the heavy metal guitarist screeching out the pursuits soundtrack its riveting stuff imaginative and witty and as an exercise in action direction its pretty flawless but the film aspires to being more than a thrilling roller coaster ride it asks us to care and on this level it falls short    we learn in the opening scene that max failed to protect his wife and daughter and so groan there are subsequent snippets of his daughter haunting him throughout the film the breeders are all so damn beautiful including super model rosie huntington whiteley and given little chance to develop individually that their shared plight is easy to dismiss the developing bond between furiosa and max thankfully doesnt end with a kiss but nor is it of much consequence nicholas hoult as one of immortans gang has a defined arc in the story which only makes you wonder why him and no one else    theron with her buzz cut racoon eyes and prosthetic arm makes a fine action heroine hardy similarly has just the right brooding presence and pouty lips to more than comfortably fill mels boots they look great together and i wish they were given more to do than drive from a to b and back again another subplot another significant complication wouldve been welcome meat on these narrative bones fury road is indeed audacious and thrilling but youll come away affected far more by millers virtuosity than the film itself
Dec 16 2015,positive,where must we gowe who wander this wasteland in search of our better selves 
Dec 16 2015,positive,minus four for plot but plus five for spectacle
Dec 16 2015,positive,despite the basic story this is some of best action i have ever seen they also used cgi perfectly     it was an awesome ride
Dec 16 2015,neutral,such a disappointment the only thing i liked about this movie was tom hardy
Dec 16 2015,negative,overhyped movie scenario is inexistant and action scene are boring
Dec 15 2015,positive,mad max fury road is thrilling from start to finish it is crafted with such excellence and george miller captures the postapocalyptic landscape with such delicacy and ease its hard to believe not only is the film a beautiful masterpiece of cinema but it should be recognized for its original storytelling beautiful cinematography amazing action and well done characters yes you can have all of that in a 2 hour car chase and thats what astounds me
Dec 15 2015,positive,mad max fury road is completely unique its visual appeal and creativity cant be denied but it is also one of the strangest films that you will ever experience  in a market where every genre is saturated with films that recycle the same concepts and ideas it is rare to find a film as unique as this one  it even feels unique when compared with the mad max films of the 80s  george miller is no stranger to the film industry and fury road may be his masterpiece  i think that it is really cool that miller wrote a new chapter into his series 30 years after the last film  most of this story is told without dialogue  the action is constant and the imagery drives the story for better or for worse we will never forget the brief milking scene or the idea of a blood bag  immortan joes mask is terrifying and the production team convincingly transformed all of the actors into nuclear holocaust survivors  i appreciated the performances by tom hardy and charlize theron though any sort of emotion seems to be overshadowed by the previous and next action sequence  this one wont be winning any oscars in acting categories but it will certainly make a run in categories like production design film editing and sound editing  to be honest i was a little bit disappointed with the film  it had so much hype for its entire theatrical run augmented by a rotten tomatoes rating of 97 and i just did not receive the amount of character development as i expect from a critically acclaimed film  still i will be the first to admit that i need to see it again to process everything that happened and may adjust my rating afterward  my wife and i are still scratching our heads about the electric guitar guy who we have discovered is named the doof warrior  we assumed that he was symbolic or sort of reference to the original films but apparently he is exactly what he appears to be a flamespewing guitarist who pumps up the rest of the troops  i suppose that he left a big enough impression that he is the only character that i have discussed  the most wellwritten character in the film is nux and we grow attached to him because he undergoes the greatest transformation  i look forward to watching this film again and believe that the sequels will be even better if they deliver the same amount of action while including a greater transformation of their characters  there are a lot of cheesy scifi films from the 70s and 80s that involve vehicles death race 2000 is the first one that comes to mind but the vehicles are perfectly incorporated into this films creative atmosphere and they are just cool  everybody loves mad max fury road for its creative postapocalyptic story and constant stream of action  i believe that the academy awards will acknowledge its effort and remind the film industry that action films can blow our minds with more than just the action
Dec 15 2015,positive,alright this was a masterpiece of 2015  5star for this one
Dec 15 2015,positive,what can i say as far as pure technical achievement goes not many films can live up to the heights of this mad max entry the complexity of its action scenes and their individual often aweinspiring shots alone arent the films only attributes however making beautiful use color in its dessert landscapes incredible locale and vehicle design and a perfect use of pacing  especially in the kinetic energy of action scenes  director george miller and his team create something that doesnt really come along often as much praise as other artistic action films like the dark knight receive that example doesnt even come close to the skill on display in the conception and editing of maxs set pieces its light on story but sometimes a film can be almost perfect without one sometimes
Dec 15 2015,positive,huge tom hardy fan and was very excited to see this film as everybody else was by the looks of it even though i enjoyed the film i still felt disappointed with it i think this was because i dont enjoy the story line and no matter how well the film was made i would still feel a little let down
Dec 14 2015,positive,could one of the best films of 2015 be a sequel to a movie from the 1970s featuring amazing chases swashbuckling action all connected through a distinct mythology and set in a time that seems too fantastic to be real the crazy answer is yes yes it can and the funny thing is im not talking about that little film with star wars in the title since the 1979 original writerdirector and doctor george miller has given the world two other iterations of mad max1981s the road warrior and 1985s mad max beyond thunderdome whom george ogilvie shared a codirecting creditbut this newest take proves an old vehicle can learn many new tricks with 2015s mad max fury roada legitimate candidate to be one of the most influential films currently made with a plot told almost exclusively through visual storytelling miller and his staff have truly outdone themselves with what the cinematic medium can dodriving from one scene to the other with frenetic pacing inspired use of editing which it should win an oscar with and subtle yet dramatic acting from tom hardy and charlize theron hardy and theronplaying main protagonists max rockatanksy and imperator furiosa respectively you have to love names like thatepitomize the brawn and finesse of millers filmmaking aesthetic amid the brutal carnage of the chases there is a chaotic fluidity to it all that evokes a beautiful danceblending music and movement to please the senses this level of sophistication has been hinted at in the previous films often with socially sensitive issues that evoked the times they were made in with realworld oil shortages in the 70s being a major headline the preservation and fight for gasoline was at the focal point in the original three this has now been replaced with the preservation of life an inspired and logical way to go showing the value of conscious awareness and preserving this place called home earth similar themes were touched upon in millers 2006 oscarwinning film happy feat the underlining theme of survival that spans each entry is representative of what mad max fury road isa film that breathes life has a never say die attitude but expresses the limitless freedom and determination of what people can achieve
Dec 14 2015,negative,history will not be kind to this
Dec 13 2015,negative,loud proud and yet relentlessly incoherent mad max fury road is a disaster of a film masquerading as bold a reboot at least of sorts of the franchise previously headlined by mel gibson director george miller brings the outlandish postapocalyptic world back to the screen we find max tom hardy captured at the hands of a crazed war lord only to find himself mixed up in the escape of the vaunted female imperator furiosa charlize theron and the warlords many prized wives     those that are prone to like mad max will point to the action scenes as proof of the films inventive and unabashedly brutal nature to a large extent this is true the film does look good and the action sequences feature uniquely conceived devices feel impactful and are extremely well choreographed and otherwise executed mad max to be sure can be fun to watch this is all fine until the point in which one dares to ask what am i watching    simply put mad max is an absolute narrative mess very little is explained only the thinnest most idiotic delivered exposition is ever given and then the sole purpose is to set up a 10 or 15 minute fight or chase scene meanwhile leaving any characterization plot or coherent narrative structure in the dust big vehicles blowing up are good eyes being gouged outthats great but in order to constitute a movie there needs to be some semblance of a storyline some reason for us to be invested in the characters     the script deficiencies dont stop at a lack of storytelling the dialogue is extremely sparse and quite literally dumbeddown it feels as if its penned by a behavior disorder fifth grader trying to be naughty during language arts utter nonsense comes out of characters with inexplicable motivations histories or personas     one might think the films cast featuring charlize theoron and tom hardy would be a saving grace talented actors as they are they are adrift in a film that wallows in absurdity and disorganization neither actor is developed and one must ask why max had the honor of the films title the character of max in this film is relegated to that of a side character and a rather uninteresting one at that the reasons for this are curious and perhaps politically motivated but regardless it was a dumb one hardy is an incredible talent and to have him so underutilized is perhaps one of the greatest cinematic crimes of 2015     outrageously terrible     155 stars
Dec 13 2015,positive,the best action movie of all time a great addition to the mad max  franchise deserves its critical standing
Dec 12 2015,positive,in the end the reboot of mad max gets its way it is a very funny film but it has something to say miller has returned us to a grotesque dirty visceral world where survival is the only currency that matters safety pin
Dec 12 2015,positive,i had really low expectations for this film but for once im glad to say that they were unfounded this is a good well made movie and  what i especially liked its that although this is not a remake or sequel it some how manages to make its self feel part of the trilogy
Dec 12 2015,positive,great fun having no clue about the mad max legacy
Dec 11 2015,negative,theres lots of style but the plot is simple enough to be a childs story even if it handles more complex themes a striking lack of any real character development for any of the main characters hamstrings what aside from the absurd visual flares guitarist on the vehicle anyone could have been a pretty good movie
Dec 11 2015,positive,one of the best movies of the year
Dec 11 2015,positive,gotta watch other mad max movies  amazing to keep the movie so engaging with such simple premise taking group to one location in a huge vehicle and returning back
Dec 11 2015,positive,spectacular action film that manages to be so much more  tom hardy makes for a dashing mad max but charlize theron really owns the picture with her depth and emotion  the chase scenes are perfectly staged  i was prepared to not really be interested in this film but it managed to blow me away
Dec 9 2015,positive,perfect blend of audio visual and character experience  the only film that has truly thrilled me in a very long time  tremendous
Dec 9 2015,positive,action was crazy good
Dec 9 2015,positive,this is one of the greatest action movies ever made and the best reboot ever made not a single unnecessary scene has been left in the movie the editing and direction makes this an unbelievable movie
Dec 7 2015,positive,a near perfect film
Dec 7 2015,positive,this movie is fantastic  mad max fury road feels like it just gulped down a case of 5 hour energy shots all condensed into two hours  to say it is a thrill ride would be an understatement  there is one 510 minute scene of the movie where you can catch your breath when they are stopped and trying to figure out where to head and that is it  the entire movie from the opening second to the finish is packed with non stop fast moving action  even if you have no idea who the character is or what this movie is about give it a shot if you are looking for a great action movie  there really isnt too much dialogue at all to talk about  just know that tom hardy and charlize theron are both really good  and i commend both of them for not being afraid to be part of a movie like this  some big name actors might find it silly to accept a role in a movie like this with george miller directing  a 2 hour car chase war with these elaborate man made put together vehicles it is absolutely awesome to see  you keep waiting to see what the next gang of bandits has in store for the main characters as they are driving across this deserted landscape  it is a downright fun movie with amazing action throughout surely one of the best movies of the year  god forbid it gets any oscar attention though the academy im sure is above picking films like this even though they deserve it
Dec 7 2015,negative,looks more like a lavish tv childrens cartoon than an actual film very fake and unconvincing cgi some of the action is dramatic and involving but none of the story or characters are and the scenes set outside of the vehicles are a dumb disaster nearly two hours long nothing more than two or three sniggers to recommend it and not a trace of intelligence at all
Dec 7 2015,negative,this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen some nice special effects but such a lack of story line that if i hadnt been with friends i would have walked out of the movie theatre charlize theron like always was an amazing actress and tom hardy fulfilled his role but they could be out doing much better movies their performance id the only thing that occasionally made this movie watchable but please dont waste your precious time on this it is a pointless senseless jumble of special effects
Dec 6 2015,positive,does mad max fury road have little backstory  and an extremely basic plot yes does the film reduce its title character to a mere secondary status yes are there bizarre scenes tons does tom hardy mumble and grunt most of the film you bet    but all of that is inconsequential to the fact that fury road is one of the most visually stunning engrossing and glorious films of the year in an age of overuse of cgi fury road is also a miracle to even exist but george millers proper use of cgi and practicality put other films to shame this goes for both the stunning scenes of vehicular carnage as well as the costume designs including immortan joes mask this films cinematography is oscarworthy    charlize theron gives an iconic performance as imperator furiosa nicolas hoult as nux delivers the best character arc of the film and tom hardy  who proved with locke that he doesnt need to move much to command a fascinating performance  proves that he doesnt need to speak much either to be a captivating the backstories are implied enough that they dont need to be delved into and fleshed out whats on the surface is gritty and excellent enough and the bizarre scenes  including a guitarwielding flamethrower called the doof warrior  add to the films intensity and postapocalyptic worldbuilding needless to say mad max fury road may be one of the best action thrillers in a long time its certainly one of the best films of 2015 by far
Dec 6 2015,positive,what a mad max movie should be
Dec 6 2015,positive,an amazing action movie a shinning light in a sea of mediocrity
Dec 6 2015,positive,if you cant fix whats broken youll go insane this line represents the theme of the entire film and the entire series max is a loner running from his past who eventually finds his humanity again by helping others perfect this film is one of the best of the year and one of the most breathtaking action flicks in even longer definitely a contender for best picture in my opinion
Dec 6 2015,positive,this remake of classic bmovie mad max 1979 the movie that made mel gibson a star in one day is george millers attempt to refilm the first and best known film of his career with a budget thousand times bigger than the one available in 1979the result is visually impressive absolutely grotesque good and bad heroes fight for gas in a postapocalyptic future society in a movie that can only be described as postmodern and cyberpunk the exhilarating action is so intense that even the rotten tomatoes critic got curried away and gave it an almost perfect score 97 tom hardy known for inception and the dark knight rises has become the next big thing in hollywood due to this remake charlize theron an absolutely top actress overall is simply great in the postfeminist role of imperator furlosa nevertheless as one might expect the fight for gas idea which was original innovative and to the point in 1979 has not aged very well and seems quite ridiculous today still the movie is top notch as an action film with some very funny moments and you will remember it for some time not for its nonexistent deeper meanings but for its overambitious and grotesque cyberpunk environment      grade b
Dec 6 2015,negative,this movie was the shiittest thing i have ever seen it is designed fir fucking bogans who enjoy cars and electric guitars there is absoulutly nothiung appealing about this movie why anyone would want to watch this shit movie with a very weak plot baffles me if you enjoyed this movie adn or recommend it to others please hang your self if i coukd negitivly rate this movie i would why the fuck would i want to watch 2 hours of ugly bald pale looking pricks drive cars and listen to heavy metal music i would rather tie a rubber band arpond my ballsack until it falls off and then choke my self with my own testicles this movie is very poor and i have no clue as to why it is the best movie of 2015
Dec 5 2015,positive,a long awaited revival of a franchise which strays away from the past  films and does not build off of them
Dec 5 2015,positive,very intense chase scenes that actually could happen based on physics but they are totally silly based on common sense but overall totally entertaining who knows why the world has become so bizare as betrayed in this flic certainly not me as not much is explained about anything but it looks and sounds great just a little more back story and it gets 5 stars but well worth the visceral experience wehn viewed in a subwoofer sound environment just a few too many buts
Dec 5 2015,positive,this is 120 minutes of visually stunning chaos the dialogue is irrelevant huge fun for our friday nights lads curry and beer event
Dec 5 2015,positive,in the end the reboot of mad max gets its way it is a very funny film but it has something to say miller has returned us to a grotesque dirty visceral world where survival is the only currency that matters amazing
Dec 4 2015,positive,top 5 movies all time   really
Dec 4 2015,positive,watched it twice to be sure  amazing film  suspenseful and gripping  technically brilliant  excellent soundtrack  tom hardy and charlize theron give powerful performances  a true classic  just honored as best picture of 2015 by the national board of review and sure to win many more awards
Dec 3 2015,positive,very well done crazy action scenes bad guys clan was a little too weird but still very good
Dec 3 2015,negative,fury road a fourth installment in the long dormant mad max franchise feels simultaneously familiar and inexplicably alien the desolate backdrop thrilling chases and camera work recall the road warrior and beyond thunderdome but its all so damn useless our long standing hero max presumably the character audiences are coming to see all but disappears behind the narratives of new additions nux and furiosa why make another mad max film if tom hardy has to sit in the passenger seat    writerdirector george miller never had much success fleshing out back story for his characters or the origin of their world and he seems to have completely lost interest in trying viewers who did not see the original trilogy of films are given no understanding of who max is or why hes fighting for survival alone in the wastes fury road provides little more information about its supposed lead than i used to be a cop and max my name is max wow profound    friends and fellow reviewers alike have countered these critiques by reminding me of how beautiful and exciting the film is i agree that fury road is visually impressive but im not sure whats exciting about not using your brain tom hardy grunting and shooting his way through a thin script certainly doesnt thrill me no matter how welllit the sand is if you want car chases and explosions for hours on end then why not just play the video game 
Dec 3 2015,positive,mad max fury road is an extraordinary movie the main characters are believable the set is an nontraditional kinetic display of vehicles the action has a special rhythm to it so your eyes dont have to wonder lastly the way the movie is shot is mainly in wide shot which reveals more of the action
Dec 2 2015,positive,action flick a good romp fun and chill looking but not much to it really driving and driving with new bad guys every fifteen minutes eye candy only
Dec 2 2015,negative,literally confused the entire movie what was the silver mouth spray paint why is it called mad max but barely even uses him as a main character why is there so much sexual chemistry between furiosa and max but its never addressed literally it was like a punk metal car race for virgins in the desert led by a silver alien looking guy
Dec 2 2015,positive,a unique movie incomparable really entertaining from the beginning till the end definitely a must watch and even more if you are a fan of the genre
Dec 1 2015,positive,great movie great message only shortcoming is it didnt go longer
Dec 1 2015,negative,terrible movie avoid it like the plague
Dec 1 2015,positive,when i saw this movie in the cinema every crazy stunt made me interested and exicited from the creativity i mean i think mad max isnt really a story to me its more like an eppisode
Dec 1 2015,positive,this was definitely a movie
Dec 1 2015,positive,explosions of awesomeness a perfect fit in the mad max series not great story but what mm movie has one
Nov 29 2015,positive,great movie its worth watching 
Nov 29 2015,negative,as a fan of the dystopic movies i saw the mad max trilogy a couple years ago bc i heard they were shining exemplars of the genre and have great action to boot i came away disappointed by the lack of an interesting plot to complement the overthetop action sequences and the postapocalyptic setting the two sequels in particular so you can imagine my excitement when news came of a new sequel but after seeing rave reviews from friends and critics alike eg this site i decided to give the franchise another try expecting somehow this time would be different    apparently the director decided the problem with his three previous attempts was that there wasnt enough adrenaline and proceeded to make the same mediocre movie but with everything turned up to 11 so instead of a mere waste time fury road was a spectacular waste of time i mean this in the literal sense the action sequences were quite the spectacle and allow us a glimpse of the atavistic savagery that lurks beneath our superficial civility and the lead actors very much impressed in the physical acting department but those positives were rendered hollow by a script one which i can only assume was written by a rather talented 13 yearold that offers little character development and a plot that can be adequately summed up as spoiler guy and girl go from point a to point b and back to point a kill bad guys along the way and save the day the chases fights and explosions soon became trite and after two exhausting hours something to be tolerated rather than relished the handful of attempts to humanize the good characters also looked clumsy and forced as incongruous as the brief tender string interludes amidst the nearconstant industrial drumming that filled up most of the run time in the end this movie offers neither hope eg children of men nor despair brazil just the anodyne comfort that the good guys won and all is right with the world again  at least until the next sequel comes along which shouldnt be long as there is a 5th installment on the way    so in conclusion if youre looking for 2 hours of mindless vroom and boom interrupted by an alleged plot this is your flick but if you appreciate even only an ounce of subtlety and intelligence avoid this movie like the plague in fact if you just want to watch tom hardy drive around the whole movie you would find locke a far superior alternative
Nov 29 2015,positive,witness this movie witness it
Nov 29 2015,positive,this movie is visually stunning and incredibly told what a mesmerizing story of redemption beautiful colors awesome action and amazing cinematography i was hooked and couldnt stop looking beginning to end loved it
Nov 28 2015,negative,had to be the worst movie ever wasted money onand it was  only 2 dollars
Nov 28 2015,positive,i didnt really care about this film when i went to the theatre ive never been a big fan of post apocalyptic themes but my feelings totally changed when i saw this beauty from george miller hardy is great as max but charlize therons furiosa steals the show
Nov 28 2015,positive,pretty good  i like the alternative thought process this movie makes you deal with
Nov 28 2015,positive,best action movie ive seen in a while
Nov 28 2015,positive,theres lots of films nowadays that are labeled epic and dont turn out to be epic well this is not one of those films this is an epic masterpiece and my favorite film of 2015 not only is this the best pure action film this century but possibly of all time believe the hype      studio warner bros pictures
Nov 27 2015,positive,nice action shallow story
Nov 27 2015,positive,story of survival externalsurvive and internalnever giving up hopegets me everytime raw and real

Nov 27 2015,positive,interesting concept drug on a little long
Nov 27 2015,positive,pure action and adrenaline rush through and through a great spectacle that never looses its momentum a must watch for anyone
Nov 27 2015,positive,witness me blood bag witness i live i die i live again    theres one word that comes to my mind after watching mad max fury road and thats the word madness this is a perfect visualization of what the term madness means i truly believe that the creators and writers of this hallucinatory trip were fed with hallucinogens a spacious cocktail of exotic mushrooms barbiturates and other drugrelated products otherwise i wouldnt know how they could think up this crazy wacky postapocalyptic film a film that feels as if it consists of a single action scene youre not given a moment to catch your breath its undeniable that this movie adopted the concept of mad max from 1979 a legendary cult film with young mel gibson in a leading role the same desolate and parched australian landscape with a shortage of water and petrol governed by fanatical gangs    i must confess ive already watched this film a while ago and i never saw the need to publish my review i thought that my opinion would contribute nothing to the general opinion that you could read here and there on the internet everyone uses the same superlatives and glorifying terms for this extravagant action movie in general everybody agrees this is an insanely great explosive ingenious and never tedious rebootits loud its unrelenting its crazily exciting and at times its just bloody weird why repeat this again i thought to myself over and over again but recent events forced me to rewrite it a bit and highlight an additional aspect thats applicable to todays events    we return to the scorching desert in a postnuclear world where people struggle to survive and follow crazy figures that rule over vital resources such as oil and water someone like immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne who thinks hes a kind of god and tyrannically keeps his followers in his grip he rules the citadel an old water reservoir and has his own private army of fanatical war boys this mad max episode shows how this lawless gang of lunatics start chasing imperator furiosa charlize the italian job theron she kidnapped joes harem including zoe kravitz daughter of shes later assisted by max rockatansky tom hardy who serves the first half hour as a living blood supply for war boy nux nicholas hoult    after the terrorist attacks in europe and hearing a debate about the motives of a suicide bomber i came to the conclusion that the creepy war boys exhibit similar characteristics they follow blindly a charismatic leader and sacrifice themselves for the greater goal a hero status is awaiting them when killed in battle they earn a one way ticket to a paradise they call valhalla by sacrificing themselves they become immortal in one fell swoop strange but after the is attacks i immediately thought of this brainwashed gang a similar motivation and the same destructive selfsacrificeand then theres the guitarist firmly attached with elastics whos stirring up the troops into action while hes playing his flamethrowing guitar an absurd image amidst total chaos similar to the drummer at the forefront during the battles at waterloo or piper bill who walked undisturbed on the beach with his bagpipes at normandy landings in wwii    its evident that every fiction film contains comparables with reality sometimes but beyond these serious digressions that overtook me i can only recommend to watch and enjoy this macho blockbuster filled with actionpacked chase scenes with futuristic cars a with diesel and gun smoke smelling stunner that deserves to be titled furiosa fury road charlize theron effortlessly outperforms nicholas hoult its not mad max who demands the lions share of attention you can call him mad drip feed instead    more reviews here  
Nov 26 2015,positive,just watch the damn film    you simply need to witness the film 
Nov 25 2015,positive,awesome worth a rewatch
Nov 25 2015,neutral,a bit weak so much potential wasted
Nov 24 2015,neutral,the effects and setting of the film are pretty cool i didnt like a lot of the way it was filmed it was discontinuous almost like they filmed it slow and used fast motion to make it look more normal not much of a plot mostly two hours of watching a bunch of cars drive around the desert and people fighting
Nov 24 2015,positive,this could be one of my favorite movies of 2015
Nov 24 2015,positive,mad max fury road is a continuation of the previous mad maxes and i thought this was pretty darn good watching this mad max youre sitting there going like what am i witnessing  if you have never seen a mad max before that will be your reaction everything about the mad max universe is so different and special bringing back miller was the by far the best decisionwithout him this movie would not have been anything close to what is was miller makes the movie feel like an original mad max film from the weird skull guys bad ass cars and post apocalyptic wasteland a great thing about mad max are the characters charlize theron plays furiosa a girl who has stolen precious cargo from main villain immortan joe that all of his followers are after charlize theron as furiosa was the highlight of the movie she is the most interesting and most impactful than any other character on screen fury road is the ultimate thrill ride and definition of a good action movie the action sequences and visual effects are so beautiful and amazing every shot is as real as it gets and looks spectacular definitely one of the best looking films of the year the movie is so alive and bright that it makes it hard to keep your eyes off the screen because you dont want to miss anything my biggest flaw in mad max is sadly tom hardys portrayal of max i didnt feel his performance was strong enough or energetic like the character should be but i overall i loved fury road its action scenes were amazing awesome characters and extremely well directed should be a fun watch for any mad max or action movie fan
Nov 23 2015,negative,while the background story maybe interesting and a good job done by the actors stuntmen special effects and makeup team the screen play is anything but spectacular lack of character development cheesy dialogue all masked by 2 hours of continuous explosions and brainless action quite suitable for those who can appreciate a film with a lack of intelligence  im willing to bet most of the hi rated reviews are paid promoters  enjoy
Nov 23 2015,negative,no script no story plain charactersdid i miss anything
Nov 22 2015,positive,no where near the classic but had its moment
Nov 22 2015,positive,a decent sequel to an already loved franchise
Nov 22 2015,positive,good stuff on the plane back from johannesburg might need to revisit on a larger screen
Nov 22 2015,positive,utterly crazy high octane there and back again with thin plotting
Nov 22 2015,negative,what a stinker where is mel when u need him they give one of hollywoods great beauties a stump for an arm this movie was perfect for a 15 yo male with no discrimanatory taste the male lead looked fat angry ugly like he forgot his lines in different scenes no acting ability combined with poor direction ill bet most of the peeps who watched this never saw the original
Nov 22 2015,positive,though the action was relentless throughout the first hour was a little difficult to follow as the dialogue is kept very much to a minimum the film is essentially a two hour chase movie and because of its basic premise it was a little too long its gender politics is something james bond could learn from and tom hardy is brilliant despite his few lines with his body language alone the postapocalyptic world is well made and you can almost smell the petrol but for the most part mad max is very loud bit too long and occasionally listless
Nov 21 2015,negative,the worst film in years  nothing of value whatsoever
Nov 21 2015,negative,wow its been a long time since ive seen a movie that bad the plot is a total disaster the storyline doesnt even explain why that creepy bald dude decided to switch sides all of a sudden let alone who max really was and what was his goal didnt work for me huge disappointment
Nov 21 2015,positive,so this film is bonkers truly bonkers its more akin to thunderdome than the post  apocalyptic bleakness of the first 2 gibson films however it is totally mesmerising and it really drew me in theres a strong female narrative although slightly undone by the scantily clad sirens however youre totally taken in by the escaping refugee narrative and a final word for the score truly evocative
Nov 21 2015,positive,i watched it 9 times in theatres i think thats all i need to say    this movie is honestly the best action movie possibly the best movie ive ever seen and yall are allowed to fight me on that
Nov 21 2015,negative,hollywoods latest garbage release intended audience teens i guess  how it got 97 on tm ill never know
Nov 20 2015,positive,mad max fury road is the best action film of the decade and one of the years very best films
Nov 20 2015,positive,i dont think ive ever seen something quite like mad max fury road with high octane action grandiose production values and a list stars it masquerades as just another summer blockbuster from hollywood but whilst it appears to tread the familiar formulaic path mad max bucks and breaks the mould audaciously refusing to conform to expectations its pace is relentless its storytelling strong its action impressive its morals commendable and surprising  it has feminism rather than machismo at its heart and its bonkers totally and utterly mad so on that front i guess it did do what it says on the tin it so easily could have been an indulgent unaccessible mess yet somehow it works the gamble paid off
Nov 20 2015,positive,a lot action was very surprised how good this was
Nov 20 2015,neutral,confusing action initially  weak plot and pales compared to the original
Nov 19 2015,positive,even fantasy has its limits and mad max fury road crossed all boundaries with its absurd amount of violence and disturbing images being a huge fan of the lord of the rings i find visual effects and extraordinary lands fascinating but this movie takes it all too far to a point of becoming rather upsetting highly overrated in my opinion
Nov 19 2015,positive,i had no hope for this movie until i saw the trailer this is the best movie that came out this year so far like ever dumb action movie now there would be jokes no jokes in this move it is perfect
Nov 19 2015,positive,lack of depth makes this a possible one and done  worth watching once but it needed more of a story
Nov 19 2015,positive,a sequel worth waiting for by any standard this is an entertaining and exciting road movie not dominated by cgi action sequences are so well choreographed you want to see it again  they are filled with fresh ideas and audacity there is not a boring moment tom hardys mad max is just as alluring too lets hope we do not need to wait another 30 years for the next one
Nov 18 2015,positive,by far one of the best cinematic experiences ive ever seen this groundbreaking action film tests and exceeds the limits of the action film stereotype a simple plot driven by great character performances from charlize theron and tom hardy these two actors break the mold of the stereotypical heroes of action films with stunning visuals and incredible liveaction stunts this film deserves every single tomato of its 97 rating from rotten tomatoes
Nov 17 2015,positive,this movie keeps you on the edge of your seat all the time if you are going for a movie that doesnt take to seriously in the sence of not being dark and gritty but rather fun for all the family the cinematography looks outstanding the colors look like they are to pop out of the screen
Nov 17 2015,positive,movie of the year all australians must see more australians in this movie then western sydney the girls are the heroes so is you a feminist this is for you for more fun check out the movie cast before watching the movie surprised me as the history is stunning and yes tom hardy is a great replacement for mel gibson specially 2015 mel gibson not shitty like thunderdome closer to mm 2 watch on big screen with sound up loud george millers manipulation of the time frames in scenes makes the movie you get to see movie the action is not to fast for the eye great movie
Nov 17 2015,neutral,the loudest most violent uturn in history thats fury road for you arguably the most overrated movie of the year its a desertset apocalyptic avatar with even less story which is incredible when you sit down and think about it
Nov 16 2015,positive,this movie is one of the most insane and chaotic movies of the summer with george miller returning to the helm for another installment of mad max it is our viewing pleasure that we get to witness such a high explosive film     this film stars tom hardy who plays the role of max alongside fellow stars charlize theron and nicholas hoult most of the actors in this movie do a phenomenal job and even though tom hardys character was the least interesting he did an amazing job as always if were on the topic of characters george miller really fumbled the ball here max is definitely the 3rd most interesting character along with being the 2nd strongest character charlize therons character was definitely put in the spotlight more and she was the bigger badass im not saying this out of opinion but the movie clearly shows on several occasions that she is the stronger power and even the more interesting     max had the least amount of depth given to him which is ironic considering his name is in the title and he had the most basic undeveloped backstory you can imagine they spent more time developing the character of nicholas hoult which was actually a good surprise rather than developing their main character     this movie though was filled tons of action and was the equivalent to a 2 hour video game the cinematography is amazing and everything looks so well done the cgi is solid for the most part but the movie does a great job of relying on practical effects and explosions there were some moments where i felt that the cgi background looked really bad but other than that they did a good job of utilizing their budget     on the contrary watching a video game for 2 hours doesnt leave a whole lot of room for plot development the movie sports a basic plot that says get from point a to point b thats all the movie really is nothing is really explained and nothing really has meaning they just see how much action they can fill into 2 hours like i said it makes for an extremely entertaining movie but i wasnt able to connect to the situation nor the characters when they tried to develop plot in the movie it felt like it came to a dead stop there was a point where nothing was going on and i was actually bored they seem to throw in random useless plot elements and it makes me groan for example at one point max and the crew meet up with these mothers that help them fight for their freedom im sure this was connected to the other mad max movies but if it wasnt then this was the most useless and boring plot device in the movie they seemed helpless and unnecessary and the whole pit stop derailed the movie     i know it seems like i have a lot of gripes about this movie but i really dont it was a great action thriller that was extremely crazy and intense i love a lot of the unique aspects in this movie and the level of crazy that they go up to they do things unimaginable to most human beings and its a really fun summer movie in the end mad max is certainly worth watching and one that i myself own on bluray
Nov 16 2015,positive,wasnt too good rather disturbing at times
Nov 15 2015,negative,for a movie with tons of potential it falls short since the film had feminist ideals everyone automatically loved the film in terms of the films itself horrible stupid confusing and pointless
Nov 15 2015,negative,one big ragefueled drive through a wasteland with no history and no explanation of the characters this film fails of any drama   the characters are trying to survive a madman but they have no story no background and no hope characters die meaninglessly conventions of the universe are just dropped into the film with no explanation whatsoever and the plot is indiscernible other than as a pointless fight to the death on a confusing wasteland for reasons that are known only to the characters and not to us
Nov 15 2015,negative,absolute and utter rubbish i can not believe it has good reviews on here its undermined the legitimacy of any rating on the whole site  a car chase one way then an otherno coherent plot no development just driving and explosions aimed at a brain dead audience who care not for story dialogue and a cinematic experience     i despair
Nov 15 2015,negative,i dont understand how this movie got such high ratings  i didnt understand anything i watched for 2 hours  did i need to watch the first one from 1979 i was 8 and dont remember anything from the movie except the car  what was the silver shit they were spraying in their mouths   why were they using other people for blood transfusions  cool special effects but i still have no other idea what the movie was about
Nov 14 2015,positive,adrenalinefuelled straightforward action car chase movie with enough plot but not enough dialogue from max
Nov 14 2015,negative, stick to the originals this is a shameful reboot of the franchise story  acting awful  mel gibson is the true mad max with the original stories being the best
Nov 14 2015,positive,a proper action movie and a must watch despite a notso compelling story and little character development it stands out in all the other aspects an action movie could desire forthe main change in cast from  mel gibson to tom hardy and the character of furiosa gives a different yet fresh feel from the original seriesthe action sequences and the carnage is stunning to watch amidst the arid and difficult landscape
Nov 13 2015,positive,dont understand the rating on this movie worth watching as its an ok film but nothing special
Nov 12 2015,positive,action packed art simple as that and wonderful throughout
Nov 10 2015,positive,its sort of like david lynch directing smokey and the bandit 2     one protracted chase sequence from start to finish with some innovative action moments but the weirdness for the sake of it of the antagonists wears a bit thin
Nov 10 2015,neutral,a lot of dramatic cut scenes a little too little story for my taste
Nov 10 2015,negative,tom hardy  not a patch on mel gibson pretty pedestrian all the way through no character development or plot
Nov 9 2015,positive,i really enjoyed the movie i would have to say it was better than i expected
Nov 9 2015,positive,im glad i didnt watch it in the theater since i needed the subtitles a few times lots and lots of chasing but i needed more than just that
Nov 8 2015,negative,horrible just horrible longest 2 hours of my life
Nov 8 2015,positive,if i had to define this movie in one word it would be spectacle film is 100 years old and change and in that time i have seen most every version of the car chase and fight then mad max comes along and give you 2 hours of action you have never seen before george miller does a flawless job of creating and executing this set pieces as well as creating a unique and intriguing post apocalyptic world this film has strong feminist undertones evening without a complicated plot several times the question is asked who killed the world and its clear it wasnt the women in a time of pretty wise cracking super heroes this throwback style seems so fresh possibly the best film of this year
Nov 8 2015,positive,i loved the concept behind mad max this movie rocked
Nov 7 2015,positive,at 70 years old director george miller returns to give a master class in how to make an action film a relentless twohour assault both on the eardrums and the eyeballs mad max fury road is the craziest film of the year daring in both ideas and imagery a spectacular carnival of carnage that puts most other blockbusters to shame
Nov 7 2015,positive,few movies can accomplish what mad max fury road does non stop action that can actually be followed despite a somewhat strange story the movie delivers an outstanding action film that will keep you up from start to finish
Nov 7 2015,positive,this is one of my favorite films of the year there is no other way to describe than just plain awesome
Nov 7 2015,positive,amazing mad max film breathtaking action great stunts and a wellwritten story this film can blow you away
Nov 7 2015,negative,mad max fury road offers a handful of technically impressive practical action sequences but the films headnumbing white noise tissuethin story and messy direction renders the whole thing a disjointed pile of twisted cinematic metal
Nov 7 2015,negative,lots of action cool cinematography but virtually no story and very little dialogue  i have no idea why it has such a high rating
Nov 7 2015,negative,why is this under horror movies haha also not the best movie 2 stars for you
Nov 7 2015,neutral,too much like a video game for my taste and  waste of tom hardys talent
Nov 7 2015,positive,excellent action sequences and visual effects  i also liked the story the characters and the acting was well done  tom hardy can do no wrong  i was thirsty when it was over p
Nov 7 2015,positive,an unflinching actionpacked ride in hell the most unlikely and original blockbuster i can remember
Nov 7 2015,negative,no plot line or anything of interest just effects 
Nov 7 2015,positive,exceptional tom hardy strikes me as a wise and mature actor to know when to leave a steamrolling charlize theron have her head she is as good as shes ever been in this we know were going to guess a lot of stuff before it happens but how it happens and how its filmed make this a thoroughly enjoyable romp breathing a solid breath of gasoline fumes into the franchise boom
Nov 7 2015,negative,pleased that i managed to make it through the whole film although as its difficult to differentiate between any of the scenes all of which are just action action action i neednt have bothered    aimed at a certain audience no doubt
Nov 6 2015,positive,what a ride this movie was i sat there gripping the handles of my bag so tightly for the entire movie i cannot fault this superbly crafted and acted movie awesome
Nov 6 2015,positive,utterly totally emphatically mad but its so much fun you dont care about the plot holes and repetitiveness kudos for making it mainly about badass women hollywood needs more of them
Nov 6 2015,negative,all action very weak storyline im really surprised at the rating this has on rotten tomatoes id stretch it to 50 at a push but no more and definitely not a patch on the old franchise if you just want to marvel at stunts this is for you if you want story look elsewhere
Nov 6 2015,positive,its an alright movie its fast paced with some good action and good car chases and the special effects are good i just think the story could have been better
Nov 5 2015,positive,where in valhalla did mad max fury road 2015 come from for years it was nothing more than a ghost story limping along in production hell until finally its trailers released and piqued little to no interest now with the feature finally in cinemas an unwitting audience has had its eyes opened and reemerged crazed and amazed without warning mad max has become a mustsee theatrical experience and required viewing for filmgoers and filmmakers alike    dont skip what i just wrote mustsee is what i put and mustsee is what i mean this is an unexpected hit that has shaken audiences in the most aweinspiring and thrilling way imaginable after a decade of planning george miller has finally shown his hand and taken the world by storm  electrical sandstorm to be precise after making childrens movies for the past couple decades miller somehow convinced the studio that he was fit to direct a sequel not a reboot the hollywood weapon of choice to a film series that hadnt been popular for 30 years in addition he seems to somehow have maintained complete creative control over a property of which many millennials read target audience have little to no knowledge how he pulled this off is a mystery and a miracle  and one of the best things to happen to movies in a long time    the avengers age of ultron 2015 has been hotly anticipated but this summer belongs to the mad    it is simply the most gorgeous exhilarating film i have seen all year breathtaking action is conducted with balletic precision miller masterfully leads the eye from beat to beat giving his scenes room to breathe and his audience a broad scope to behold he is not afraid to pull back and let every element of his rich textured world be absorbed studied and most importantly understood in the midst of incredible chaos the direction and editing stands in stark contrast to the claustrophobic frenetic camerawork that has dominated action films over the past decade    its been reported that miller spent the years leading up to production crafting every element of this postapocalyptic future in the greatest detail from mechanical body art and dashboard decor to endless storyboards and a choreography of violent perpetual motion millers own gleeful madness has crafted a movie so eyepopping in its reality that repeat viewings are a happy necessity the camera brilliantly frames and deftly tracks through increasingly intricate explosive and dynamic chase scenes with deft purpose    cinematographer john seale presents us with generously saturated shots resplendent with deep blues and fiery reds even the night scenes are a triumph of art seale overexposed these shots during daylight before giving them their midnight blue tint thus allowing the shade and depth of the elements to be captured and clarified in the dark even if you hate everything else about the movie impossible its intensely beautiful just to look at    although titled mad max tom hardy and charlize theron absolutely share the lead with the warrior imperator furiosa given just as much narrative depth  if not more  than hardys wild dog of a max like max furiosa is a professional badass  even with a missing hand their gradual alliance is destined to be one of the most classic pairings in cinema the nihilistic max is put to the test by the idealistic furiosa her sense of morality a bright light in a dark future in turn furiosas gambit against hugh i played toecutter keaysbyrnes tyrannical immortan joe proves disastrous without maxs honed remorseless instincts both the hero and antihero plunge into the insanity with only a faint hope of rising above their personal tragedies    significant portions of the thundering soundtrack are played by immortan joes own band on the run a raging tireless team of drummers led by a mutant guitarist shredding an axe so rock n roll that it literally spurts flames the absurd concept is a wonderfully bizarre choice for the film and a terrible temptation for those of us forced to drive the speed limit on the way home    mad max fury road is a spectacular victory in filmmaking and has rightfully earned its status as a new standard for action movies its balance of practical incamera effects with tangible cgi imagery coupled with millers patient planning and meticulous layout of his story is exactly why a movie that couldve been another runofthemill action flick has instead become an instant classic    what a film what a lovely film
Nov 5 2015,positive,adamant i wasnt going to like such a loud and aggressive action movie but i loved it
Nov 5 2015,positive,not a big fan of mindless action flicks but this film was amazing and glad i gave it a look
Nov 5 2015,positive,a woman has to drive a car from point a to point b then she turns left what follows is a thrillride like no other that will leave you breathless by the end this movie will ride eternal shiny and chrome
Nov 5 2015,positive,fury road will make you question if youve seen a real action movie lately with nonstop sequences and a fantastic ensemble you are never disappointed
Nov 5 2015,positive,wall to wall of great action
Nov 4 2015,positive,awesome action movie enough said
Nov 3 2015,positive,its not often that remakes can match the original in this case its my opinion that this remake surpasses the original in many ways the film is dark and light in equal amounts and hardy  theron are outstanding special mention for art direction  set design
Nov 3 2015,positive,a rush of madness action and insanity will come over you and youll know that youre watching mad max fury road definitely one of the best movies of 2015
Nov 3 2015,positive,impressive hyperkinetic action movie redefining the standards of the genre  top visuals and consistency 3d is a must  dusty deserted landscapes makes you cough dont drink too much coffee before watching it
Nov 3 2015,positive,excellent action excellent effects and excellent performances   the title however should read mad furiosa but thats not a bad thing
Nov 2 2015,negative,just another boring action movie  gets old and boring real fast
Nov 2 2015,positive,exceptionally actionpacked with a defined world and engaging characters
Nov 2 2015,positive,ridiculous riproaring over the top fun not much of a plot to be honest but with this much visual stimuli you dont really need it my only negative is that i feel tom hardy was a little wasted on a film where he barely says more than a few lines of dialogue
Nov 2 2015,positive,it is certainly a visual and aural feast and a stunt junkies wet dream but without much else it does get a bit tiresome there is very little character development and why it is called mad max is beyond me he is practically a nothing character in this there are a few interludes where characters take a breath to let us know why we should care about what is going on then off they go again and we realise we dont
Nov 2 2015,positive,this film challenged my manhood  and he won
Nov 2 2015,positive,i feel this movie should have been called furiosa to the max
Nov 2 2015,positive,there was never a dull moment in this movie pristine direction wonderfully acted believable and compelling characters and has a satisfying conclusion truly it stood its ground against action film greats such as die hard the matrix and the dark knight arguably the best movie in the mad max anthology
Nov 2 2015,positive,an action packed beautifully filmed movie with an incredible performance by charlize theron if you havent seen this movie yet you should there is nothing else to it
Nov 2 2015,negative,really stupid movie that is absolutely nothing but a 2 hour chase scene now i like chase scenes as much as anyone but not for the entire movie and not in lieu of a plot any plot not even anywhere close to the originals
Nov 2 2015,negative,if you want to watch stuff blowing up for 2 hours this movie is for you
Nov 2 2015,positive,i was really really young when the first movie of mad max came out and it was kind of weird i liked it back then but for obvious reasons it kind of scared me so it was a bittersweet feeling back then     watching this one i kind of went down the memory lane and really enjoyed it it was both nostalgic but also intense for me and it did not let me down in terms of effects or the general feeling i had imprinted in my mind     the acting was ok and i am not sure if it really matters the movie is so action packed and intense that even less talented actors could have pulled it off i think i was amazed by the costumes the make up the vehicles everything the music of the movie was so good     i liked the bad guys as they seemed and were really really bad and i enjoyed every minute of the chase that goes on for almost the entire movie the fiction part was there but its something you expect in such movies    i was really really close to rate it with a 9 out of 10 but i decided that an 8 is closer to the truth based on other movies of the genre if i could i would give an 85 to it
Nov 1 2015,positive,very exciting and unexpectedly good a good example for remaking a classic well done
Nov 1 2015,positive,2nd best film of 2015
Nov 1 2015,positive,stunning action movie  so much to take in one viewing is not enough  breath taking action sequences
Nov 1 2015,negative,a real good mad max movie for some parents
Nov 1 2015,positive,1001 movies to see before you die mad max fury road 2015  added 2016  i was surprised how much i enjoyed it creative original well directed and surprisingly good with the little dialogue it had
Nov 1 2015,positive,from our netflix dvd listone long car chase i rate it b
Nov 1 2015,positive,the ultimate 80s film that never came out in the 80s
Nov 1 2015,negative,2 hours of my life ill never get back horrible
Nov 1 2015,positive,this film cant be faulted on it imagination its visuals or it complex imagery but for a regular viewer this is just a great car chase
Nov 1 2015,negative,i loved the original but this was a waste of 2 hours
Oct 31 2015,negative,what a disappointment  only the third movie that ive left mid way  does no justice the the 1st and 2nd in the set
Oct 31 2015,positive,is it any good yes its exceptional is it as crazy as it looks crazier did tom hardy deliver absolutely he nailed those thirteen or so lines
Oct 31 2015,positive,great film full on action and not over the top
Oct 31 2015,positive,hands down one of the best and most artistic action films ive ever seen highly recommended ill be watching out for mr hardy now
Oct 31 2015,negative,how oh how can the critics have got this so wrong incessant witless virtually plotless cartoon action devoid of everything that made the previous mad max films terrific
Oct 30 2015,positive,pure adrenaline rush the most fun you will have at the movies this year
Oct 30 2015,positive,breathtaking fx and incredibly shot cinematography make this new mad max feature the best action film i have seen this decade
Oct 30 2015,negative,i dont get why this movie is so highly rated its just one big car chase
Oct 30 2015,positive,masterfully made film that the mass audience can enjoy but only film buffs will understand
Oct 30 2015,positive,best film of the year so far 4755
Oct 30 2015,neutral,there can be only one max rockatansky
Oct 30 2015,positive,i am a huge fan of tom hardy he is a very talented actor that commands the screen and seems to be very versatile however because once again he goes through the film grunting and mumbling i have had to know half a star off at first i thought he was going to attempt an aussie accent but soon went straight back into bain nevertheless i do believe he controlled the screen well     the storyline itself was good simple yet easy to relate and gave a good sense of morality the main stand out element to this film was the superb special effects and stunts which has been one of the best ive seen within the last 10 years the film itself knows exactly what it is and plays well upon it high octane none stop balls out action contender for film of the yearplease stop grunting tom
Oct 30 2015,negative,just doesnt live up to the original quite disappointed as really looked forward to seeing it
Oct 30 2015,negative,it could have last 45 minutes less and so doing concentrating action and sparing some useless footage a lost occasion for a better movie back to life naiiing the coffin i would rather say
Oct 29 2015,positive,one of the weirdest movies i ever seen
Oct 29 2015,positive,one of the very best action films ever made fury road is a testament to what all movies should strive to be a medium so creative it transports us to places our minds couldnt even possibly conceive themselves the postapocalyptic world and society in the film is fascinating to examine and the action sequences that take place within them will have audiences collective jaws on the floor for the two hour nonstop thrill ride a 21st century masterpiece
Oct 28 2015,positive,great art direction strong characters great fx  only notice i felt like the ending was a little rushed especially when the middle was that developed
Oct 28 2015,positive,mad max fury road much like its protagonists operates on sheer force and drive pun intended the thrills and style of this movie are unmatched
Oct 28 2015,positive,exactly what i expectedpacked with action mixed with some strange
Oct 28 2015,positive,freaking blew me away i would use up the character limit ranting
Oct 28 2015,positive,so much action it was nonstop even i was exhausted by the time the movie was over and i watched it from my couch while wearing my pjs
Oct 28 2015,positive,the movie is beautiful but max is not good like mel gibson
Oct 28 2015,positive,film of the year for me so far just fantastic a non stop adrenaline rush from beginning to end amazing
Oct 28 2015,positive,i expected to see stylized visuals amazing action scenes and awesome backdrops and settings  however the films plot and narrative were great surprises  they are both far better then i could have imagined  there are some very minor nitpicks that i can make  however they do not draw away from what is a great movie and one i would recommend to anyone
Oct 27 2015,positive,amazing loved every minute
Oct 27 2015,positive,there were only a few moments were my interest was not peaked entirely an incredible thrilling and exhilarating ride i cannot imagine the amount of work that went into making this film
Oct 27 2015,negative,most overrated movie ever    if you like one seemingly neverending chase scene in a futuristic desert with explosions and goblins youll enjoy because you get 2 whole hours of it    all others stay far away unless you want to put the movie in the background while you hang with friends to occasionally glance at one of the explosions
Oct 26 2015,positive,best movie in the last 20 years not the best story but by far the best movie
Oct 26 2015,positive, action locations furiosa mad max   plot
Oct 26 2015,positive,this is a mesmerizing and beautiful cinematic experience that has shaken the film as a whole and resurrected the action genre from the deepest of depths  this film is glorious magnificent mad and raw  above all mad max fury road is a masterpiece and will stand the test of time as the greatest that cinema has to offer thank you george miller thank you
Oct 26 2015,negative,may be i was expecting too much but this feels like retelling of an old story everything is predictable just ended up watching it for the action
Oct 26 2015,positive,a superb film packed with intense edge of your seat action powerhouse performances and a fresh sense of absolute craziness which carries throughout the entire run time its a fun entertaining and thrilling chase film with compelling characters perfectly choreographed action and suspense not to mention it is utterly unpredictable by far one of the best films i have seen all year and absolutely gets an a
Oct 26 2015,negative,some picturesque action sequences but ultimately dull and uninspired
Oct 26 2015,positive,mad max fury road is one of the best action movies i have ever seen it has redefined the action genre and had the best practical effects i have ever seen  this movie does have some flaws one being when you think back the story wast the greatest tom hardy charlize theron nicolas hoult and hugh keaysbyrne all give outstanding performances
Oct 26 2015,negative,i have no idea what that was all about
Oct 25 2015,negative,awesome visuals but action movies just aint my thing
Oct 25 2015,positive,mad max fury road is the best film of the summer by far it is also one of the best action films since the dark knight almost all of the action is practical and it makes the movie even better
Oct 25 2015,negative,visually spectacular but otherwise dull max drifts from locke to bane while charlize looks pretty much like monster by the end
Oct 25 2015,positive,everyone is right this is an awesome movie absolutely love how clever and hilarious the huffing of chrome colored spray paint just before a suicidal mission is explains a lot about these characters not really sure what some people were talking about when they said max was barely in the movie its no more therons movie than thunderdome was turners
Oct 25 2015,positive,this movie is way better than i thought it would be its mindless action fun of course but its an incredible ride an adrenaline rush from start to finish  i honestly cannot believe that this is the same director that did the first mad max films more than 30 years ago  the direction is so fresh and energetic it seems like someone much younger with a fresh perspective on action films would be responsible for such a film  ill admit that i was never a fan of the first films never even saw the third and found them exceptionally boring  this film is a complete 180 of the originals its jampacked with action action and more action  and its all awesome  the whole film is a series of carchasefight scenes car chases  fights  fights on top of cars yet it never gets boring  its visually eyepopping everything is wellchoreographed and composed and the stuntwork is freakin incredible  luckily there are some moments of down time where we do get to learn a bit about the  characters its just enough to let the audience catch its breath then off it goes again  the film doesnt bother explaining the hows and whys of this dystopian future but shows you the world and society as it is now complete with a culture that is surprisingly welldeveloped  the story isnt that deep or compelling but its got more substance than i expected it to  the acting is solid too especially by charlize theron who is completely believable as a badass dont let the title fool you this movie is therons show   i do wish there had been a little more explanation of the backstory sometimes the story and characters motivations get a bit murky but there is simply not enough room for that in the movie like this it would have disrupted the flow  this movie is pure action spectacle and raw entertainment  its a wham bam thank you maam and everything a summer action flick should be
Oct 25 2015,negative,mad max proves once again that you need more than special effects to make a good movie
Oct 25 2015,negative,most overrated garbage ive ever watched if this is representative of the mad max universe then its absurd  in a battle of dwindling resources packs of morons chase each other around in gasguzzling automobiles  this is the future
Oct 25 2015,positive,this is how action movies should be done period
Oct 25 2015,positive,non stop action movie flies
Oct 25 2015,positive,incrediblethe best action movie ever made it makes the original mad max look ordinary
Oct 25 2015,positive,excellent if youre into this sort of thing
Oct 25 2015,positive,crazy exciting and thrilling tom hardy is perfect as max and charlize theron delivered a great performance one of the best action movies ever made and possibly the best mad max movie ever made
Oct 25 2015,negative,ive never totally disagreed with rotten tomatoes on good movie choice  ive always liked the movies that critics and audience both enjoyed  sometime i like a movie better but not worse this one breaks that  98 to a movie i would give 15 and that is for special effects and because charlize theron  mad max was not present and neither was a good story line or character build up
Oct 25 2015,neutral,the plot was a bit weak and didnt make sense disappointed
Oct 24 2015,positive,great action sequences theron drives the film
Oct 24 2015,positive,absolutely incredible visuals effects music and cast  so much detail went into this film thats only revealed in the making ofs on the dvd my favourite film  of the year the choreography pace and impact of the action left us feeling emotionally raw worth watching again and again unfortunately going to most certainly going to be snubbed at the oscars as its not arty farty enough
Oct 24 2015,positive,this movie was great for what it was and for what the original was an action movie to be watched i thoroughly enjoyed it
Oct 24 2015,negative,way too much action  lacks any actual plot in my opinion
Oct 24 2015,positive,intense nonstop actionthriller
Oct 24 2015,positive,literally the most amazing action movie ever
Oct 24 2015,positive,mad max fury road was far from a perfect film but it was much more enjoyable than i anticipated it was exciting the acting was great the story yes unlike what youve been told theres actually a story was captivating and while not really all that original it felt fresh and unique in how it was told overall this was very entertaining and i look forward to future installments the negatives were that charlize theron has way too large of a role even in the trailer and promotional posters shes clearly the star does this hurt the film not necessarily but it feels unnecessary the story shouldve focused more on max we got almost no backstory for his character whatsoever and he maybe speaks a dozen lines the other element that was a weak point was that some of the scenes were a bit too ridiculous i expect some of it but not to the extent where you have a guy standing on top of a vehicle traveling at high speeds through the desert while playing an electric guitar with flames coming out of the tip yeah that happens
Oct 24 2015,positive,brilliant even without tina turner 
Oct 24 2015,positive,best movie of 2015 beautiful and bloody
Oct 24 2015,positive,while fury road is superior to its predecessors and profits from interesting characters clever dialog some great makeup and costume design and fantastic use of practical effects rarely seen nowadays it also suffers from a lack of a compelling story and fails to take advantage of tom hardys suitable portrayal of max rockatansky
Oct 24 2015,positive,i was worried at first what with all the hype that this existentially 2hr chase movie would be an underwhelming pile of tripe of course it is a very simplistic action blowem up characters are archetypes dialogue comes with a fair amount of spittle and there are no real revelations here it is really succeeds best  at drawing you in visually and not letting go you are chained to this ballsout burst of blood and oil spectacle which hurtles along at such a pace that thinking too reflexively is not advised there has been much made of the films feminist elements and they are intentional and wellintended however it falls short in the end as the plot still relies on the trope of the strong silent man with the brave plan whom the queen needs to convince her to not despair and risk the messy death again to do the logical thing come for the satisfying crunch of righteous fury stay for a captivating sequence of explosions
Oct 24 2015,positive,not sure what all the hype was about
Oct 24 2015,positive,amazing action sequences and practical effects terrific acting by charlize theron and rich in imagination
Oct 23 2015,neutral,dont understand why this is rated so well
Oct 23 2015,negative,the entire movie was a car chase threw the desert unbelievable
Oct 23 2015,positive,this movie is completely crazy and full of weird characters but if you watched the other movies from the series you know that this is what you expect when you go see a mad max movie with that in mind this is an amazing ride full of action and crazy car chases with a little bit o story here and there
Oct 23 2015,neutral,i miss the desolation of the earlier movies
Oct 22 2015,positive,a headbanging thunderous movie with enough action to fill several more sequels  the guitar guy alone could have his own movie awesome summer popcorn madness
Oct 22 2015,positive,far and away the best action picture of 2015 and possibly of all time mad max fury road crackles with outstanding visual design superb narrative symbolism and fascinating editing there isnt a boring second in the whole picture
Oct 22 2015,positive,i gotta say a lot of people hyped this movie up big time and i feel like it didnt meet such high expectations  a second watch is probably in order  nevertheless it was a highly entertaining action flick  you can leave plot at the door its all about crazy action and it does crazy action very well  despite being a gritty story visually its beautiful
Oct 22 2015,positive,really great visuals and really great action characters range from meh to good hardly anything that can be called a story sadly doesnt live up to all the hype its been given it wasnt really meant to be much more than a really good action flick but at least for me that cant make it a great film at least not as good as i was led to believe
Oct 22 2015,positive,mad max fury road its been 30 years since the last time we experienced the escapades of max rockatansky and his leaderclad dystopian future were the years of waiting worth it hell yeah but not as much as everyone thinks of course its an action movie and a phenomenal one at that fastpaced outlandish and incredibly creative driving sequences make up a decent portion of the film and these scenes are incredible but of course this is what everyone is expecting im noticing very few people are asking hows the story or how about the characters or how does a dystopian future lead to cult driven biker gangs this is the biggest problem with the film nothing is explained why is max captured by the strange cult who is immortal joe how does he have control of all the water what is the basis of his religion who is furiosa why is she leading this convoy whats the story of all the other gangs are they friendly with each other enemies why do joes minions spray chrome on their face why is max really involved in all this all these questions and more will not be answered in this film this is what turned me away during my second viewing of this film theres a lot of sacrifice of character development and filing in plot holes to make room for all the action but in theory thats what mad max is the only film that really had slow moments and focused on the story was beyond thunderdome a film thats overblown by the other two as well as getting lost in the 80s at the end of the day thats all fury road is a chase movie although i personally prefer road warrior if im watching a chase movie but mad max is definitely a great addition to the emerging genre of the secretly smart dick flicks
Oct 22 2015,positive,i know several people who really dislike this movie im guessing because it was hyped and lauded so much when its a pretty dumb action flick i went in thinking it was going to be another crappy rebootremakesequel and came out really surprised then i thought about it for awhile and went to see it twice more it is a great action movie a great exploitationgrindhouse film and i think a modern classic i dont like tom hardy and i think hes great in the role of max because he hardly talks with the exception of the stupid madefor3d shot near the end you know which one this is one of the most fun films ive seen come out in years obviously dont be expecting lawrence of arabia here
Oct 22 2015,neutral,good action and good special effects story nothing special theron but specially hardy cannot show their best
Oct 22 2015,positive,if youre into nonstop action and gore youll love this critically acclaimed flick i enjoyed george millers fury road as much as the next viewer but i still couldnt help feeling a little empty based on the lack of actual involvement of the titular character i get charlize therons furiosa is vital to the progression of the series but i need more participation from max nonetheless its a worthwhile watch the coolest random bit of this summer was the flamethrowing guitar guy amazing stuff
Oct 22 2015,positive,fantastic best movie of the year
Oct 21 2015,positive,best action movie ever i saw it three times in the theaters
Oct 21 2015,neutral,not my type of movie but well done a mess of a plot hard to follow
Oct 21 2015,positive,if has a good story i give 5 star for that
Oct 21 2015,negative,this movie in a nutshell victorias secret supermodels one of which is pregnant run off with bane from batman and a really butch amputee charlize theron across a barren wasteland while being chased by the characters of twisted metal basically the plot of waterworld with even crazier characters but on dirt at least the cinematography was pretty impressive
Oct 20 2015,negative,overrate it is fast and furious in the desert scenario just chasing around killing the bad guys and go back home
Oct 20 2015,positive,visceral is the word most often associated with fury road and its the right word to describe this film  everything is satisfyingly crunchy from the roar of deranged v8 rat rods and muscle cars to the spectacular action sequences to the coloursaturated landscape to the pounding soundtrack capped off by the unforgettable flamethrowing guitarwielding redonesieclad doof warrior    from the moment it starts youll be dragged along for a pulse pounding chase across the desert  its a simple enough story but its obvious from the start that plenty of thought has been put into constructing this dystopian reality  small touches will jump out at you like the intricately designed roof of the war rig or the ritual scarification of the war boys that will complete your sense of immersion in this world    the only reason it doesnt get the full five stars is because of the lack of australian humour although even that appears in places and for a touch of sentimentality that jars somewhat with the nihilistic survival themes that characterise the mad max films    other than that so close to perfect that it doesnt matter  greatest film of 2015 hands down
Oct 20 2015,positive,truly the best film of 2015
Oct 20 2015,positive,while moderately overhyped mad max fury road is still a really good movie in fact i will go to as far and say that its pretty great and for someone who is not too familiar with the other mad max movies i can safely say that anyone who hasnt seen them will find a lot to enjoy and it may introduce new fans of the series   while tom hardy may not share much resemblance to mel gibson he does a good job at making the role his own as well as preforming some great stunt work which is what i want to see from this guy but by far the best characterperformance in the whole movie is charlize theron as furiosa who steels the entire show and makes it her movie in fact she is more of a hero than max is in this movie visually this movie is absolutely fantastic this movie is gorgeous to look at if this film wins the oscar for best cinematography i will not be disappointed   the number 1 thing fans go for in this kind of film is the action and boy do we get a lot of it the action scenes pretty much take up take up almost the entire movie and to say that it keeps you on the edge of your seat would be an understatement but once in a while the film slows down so that we can learn more about the characters especially furiosa now granted it is very short lived just so that we can get back to the action but i at least give the filmmakers for at least trying for trying to help us latch on to the main character and making us feel for them during the action scenes also did why is no one talking about nicolas hoult in the movie he did a great job and i really felt sorry for his character   my only problems with the film would be that the flash backs that max kept having did get a little overused yes we get it movie he has a dark past you had 3 movies to establish this also the villain was really underdeveloped but with a good look and a bad ass voice that does not matter   all around a great film and probably the best experience watching a movie in a while
Oct 20 2015,positive,a great revival to the series we needed a new one after thunderdome
Oct 19 2015,positive,director george miller delivers a kinetic and visually spectacular cinematic experience in his fourth entry to the mad max series  through his masterful use of the camera miller elevates what is basically a two hour car chase through the postapocalyptic desert into high art placing the existential stakes for the characters at the centre of his narrative
Oct 19 2015,positive,the best action movie in years
Oct 19 2015,positive,if you love the road warrior shut up and watch this movie
Oct 19 2015,neutral,i can get behind the craziness of the characters but i found the plot and character development too bland
Oct 19 2015,positive,tom hardy is constrained even without the face mask however its adrenalin overthetop action that fuels this bonkers desert race hugely enjoyable from mad start to mad finish
Oct 19 2015,positive,not quite as good a story as the originals and mel gibson boasts a better mad max however the visuals happened to be very engrossing and wonderful to look at
Oct 18 2015,positive,cartoonish silly over the top perfect
Oct 18 2015,positive,better than 1 or 3 but still nothing exceptional  another film where the poster boy isnt the protagonist  not a patch on mad max 2 the road warrior
Oct 18 2015,positive,fucking brilliant there isnt words to describe this masterpiece
Oct 18 2015,neutral,action but disappointed not as good as the original
Oct 18 2015,negative,the movie is packed with actions from the beginning to the end plot  what plot  shooting shooting driving and shooting thats pretty much it
Oct 18 2015,positive,waferthin plot but the shear creativity of the visuals and outandout lunacy of the stuntwork make for an incredible and exciting two hours
Oct 18 2015,positive,might i just say if you want to kill 2 hours with amazing action and fun this is the way to do it
Oct 17 2015,positive,loved it great movie
Oct 17 2015,positive,i am gonna die im gonna die historic on the fury road
Oct 17 2015,positive,this  this is an action movie  i hate action movies because the stories are often vapid  the story in mad max fury road is meaningful its powerful  and its matched only by the stunning cinematography  this movie is gorgeously shot and perfectly edited  every action scene is natural  it isnt forced even if there are some very choreographed scenes  it works  and considering the movement of the vehicles as these shots take place it feels real  im sure there are some effects used but the scale is epic and reminds me of the intensity of the chariot races in benhur  simply said this movie is brilliant
Oct 17 2015,positive,fantastic non stop action i swear some scenes i never blinked for 10 minutes
Oct 17 2015,positive,pretty much a perfect move from where the original series left off unique and beautiful
Oct 17 2015,positive,great nonstop action how all action movies should be would like to see it get some oscar attentio
Oct 16 2015,positive,nice action sound effects i guess the return part was a little out of place but good movie overall
Oct 16 2015,negative,god that was boring for an action movie just couldnt care about these characters didnt really understand their motivations the world didnt make any sense some of the fx were fun lots of practical stunts and such that you dont see much any more but really a 2 hour car chase yawn
Oct 16 2015,positive,george miller gives us exciting action a simple story and great performances from charlize theron tom hardy and nicholas hoult in the 4th mad max movie
Oct 16 2015,positive,nonstop action really it literally doesnt stop
Oct 16 2015,positive,an okay film definitely not for the viewer looking for anything more than high packed action
Oct 16 2015,negative,puddle of diarrhea everyone who thinks this is a movie should be thrown to the sharks  97 really i say this place is rigged with payed votes no doubt about it   what a shit movie from the very first minute i wanted to turn it off then i just fell asleep and when i woke up with 30 minutes left i just skipped it to the end what a fucking puddle of diarrhea
Oct 15 2015,positive,mad max fury road is a visceral ride featuring incredibly impressive action scenes some surprisingly strong performances from tomhardy charlize theron and nicholas hoult and achingly beautiful cinematography while inside out is probably the strongest film of 2015 ive seen in cerebral heft fury road will probably be higher on my fend of 2015 list act due to the fact that i can see myself revisiting this one many times verdict a
Oct 15 2015,positive,unbelievably good  better with each subsequent viewing  george miller cements his legacy by expanding both his post apocalyptic universe and the scope of action films  the problem with this film is   just kidding there are no problems  this is a scifi action film will impact film making from this point forward
Oct 15 2015,positive,barely time to catch your breath  it doesnt stop
Oct 15 2015,negative,this is why you cant even trust rotten tomato all the time  went in with low expectations and the movie was still disappointing  not worth the time
Oct 15 2015,positive,this is my new favorite movie i couldnt love it enough
Oct 14 2015,negative,one of worst movies ever saw no clue why this is liked
Oct 14 2015,positive,confusing start but good ending
Oct 14 2015,positive,mad max is an extremely enthralling action film that grabs your attention by the collar slams it to the floor and beats it to a pulp
Oct 14 2015,positive,a reminder to how fun and exciting realistic effects can make a movie a wonderful return for mad max
Oct 14 2015,positive,brilliant is the only thing i can say about this film
Oct 14 2015,positive,some interesting elements to the film worth a watch but never going to be a classic a good effort but glad i didnt pay for the cinema
Oct 12 2015,negative,this movie sucks the plot sucksno sorry at all it was a petty movie good to watch when boredom strikes but not when you really want to see something really good sad
Oct 12 2015,positive,george miller has managed to make one of the best action films ever made much like a silent film fury road tells a story and shows character development through rich visuals and excellent directing
Oct 12 2015,positive,an awesome reboot without gibson
Oct 12 2015,positive,probably one of the best action films of all time this new entry to the mad max franchise is everything you expect it to be and more george miller has once again reinvented action cinema
Oct 12 2015,positive,best action movie in decades
Oct 12 2015,positive,very good next mad max chapter
Oct 12 2015,positive,review  what an epic ride im not one for remakes but this was a great movie its full of action right from the beginning to the end and the stunts were amazing personally i think the movie should have been called mad furiosa because max hardly said a word through the whole film anyway in this movie you see max rockatansky tom hardy being captured by a group of rebels who keep him in a dungeon as there prisoner when furiosa charlize theron is told to pick up some gasoline for the rebels she takes his five pregnant wives with her because they want to escape from the ruthless warlord immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne whilst travelling across the dangerous wasteland joe soon realises that his wives have escaped so he gathers his various gangs together so he can get them back max also travels with the rebels and he manages to escape from them and ends up helping furiosa on her impossible mission the storyline was great and the intensity throughout the movie kept me on the edge of my seat charlize therons performance was outstanding and the whole look of the movie was brilliant it does end quite abruptly so i hope they come out with a sequel soon im waiting to see mad max kick butt because there wasnt that much depth to his character thats not to say that tom hardy didnt play his part well but there was just way to much going on for the director to go into his story hopefully he will do in the sequel anyway its definitely one of the best films that i have watched this year and for a remake it makes the original look mediocre brilliant    roundup  charlize theron 40 first came on the scene in the children of the corn iii if anyone actually saw it but most people remember her in two days in the valley in 1996 after starring alongside tom hanks in that thing you do she played a major role as keanu reeves wife in the devils advocate in 1997 which pushed her to the big league her next major role was alongside johnny depp in the astronauts wife in 1999 and after the successful legend of bagger vance she starred with keanu reeves again in sweet november after that she had a string of average movies like 15 minutes trapped and waking up in reno and then she starred in a leading role in the italian job remake in 2004 she won an oscar  golden globe award for the best leading role in monster and she was nominated for the same award for north country in 2005 after the disappointing aeon flux movie in 2005 she didnt really come back into the limelight until she starred alongside will smith in hancock which i quite enjoyed she then got high praise for her role in young adult in 2011 and she also starred in the long awaited prometheus after that she proved that she can tackle most genres by starring in snow white and the huntsman and a million ways to die in the west and then she comes out with this movie were she put in a terrific performance i just hope she returns for the sequel this movie was directed my george miller who also made the original mad max movies he also directed the twilight movie the witches of eastwick lorenzos oil babe and happy feet 1  2 so he definitely has experience in different genres its planned that he will be directing the sequel mad max wasteland so i hope that he doesnt spoil the franchise now that this movie made such a healthy profit anyway the cast was perfect and the concept was fresh and definitely worth a watch    budget 150million  worldwide gross 375million    i recommend this movie to people who are into their actionadventurescifi movies about a man who helps a radical woman to bring 5 pregnant women to safety 810
Oct 11 2015,positive,this was a work of art and a love letter to vehicle explosions a lot of care and attention went into making this amazing film
Oct 11 2015,positive,so intense so much actiondoes more than justice to the legendary franchise
Oct 11 2015,negative,if you watched the origionals this movie is a sore dissapointment if you have never seen any of the old ones it was probably pretty good
Oct 11 2015,positive,i was really looking forward to this film because it got such good reviews and a couple friends said how much they liked it i thought that there wasnt really much of a story it was just a lot of mind numbing action and explosions all of that was really cool to watch burt there wasnt much more to the film than that i think the best thing about the film that made it interesting to me was the way in which it was filmed visually it was a very unique and interesting film and i i liked that aspect very much but the story was pretty simple i was expecting more
Oct 11 2015,positive,this is an amazing nod to past maxs and its a great  movie in and of itself the special effects done without cg is a great experience and you can really tell a difference
Oct 11 2015,negative,want to watch a similar movie watch transformers  poor character development check  poor story development check  terrible dialog check  nonstop action check    its a laughingly mediocre movie with awesome visuals thatll leave you looking at your watch
Oct 11 2015,positive,this is one of the best action movies that ive ever saw
Oct 11 2015,positive,good film but what was wrong with max every time he could have said a line he literally grunted and stared into the camera
Oct 11 2015,positive,most exiting movie ever
Oct 11 2015,positive,this movie is gonzo bonkers loved it tom hardy is really incapable of making a bad movie i hope they make another one george miller is to be commended for all of the cars he legitimately wrecked practical effects  and good villain deaths  are his specialty  a couch must
Oct 11 2015,negative,a decent attempt to revive something that did not need to be revived i still prefer the originals totally forgettable
Oct 11 2015,negative,very drawn out and boring
Oct 11 2015,negative,this wasit    i do not understand why this is so highly rated on both sides critics and audience
Oct 10 2015,positive,yo action movies im really happy for you ima let you finish but mad max fury road is not one of the best of all time not one of the best action movies of all time people andor this really isnt my genre
Oct 10 2015,positive,redefines nonstop action fury road has to be the longest car chase sequence ever
Oct 10 2015,positive,simple but brilliant  easy to watch over and over again  theron and hardy deliver outstanding performances
Oct 10 2015,neutral,damn not only did it sound awesome on my system i now want a air flow twin v8 engine
Oct 10 2015,positive,wouldve been perfect with a little more max
Oct 10 2015,negative,the most boring show with a set of dirty painted faces dont waste your money
Oct 10 2015,positive,in this fastpaced chase that doesnt stop moving george miller finds himself directing not just the movie but the viewer also taking us on a riproaring ride for the ages
Oct 9 2015,positive,it was ok not like mel gibson but still worth a watch
Oct 9 2015,positive,i left the theatre happy
Oct 9 2015,positive,fantastic action film does a great job of showing not telling
Oct 9 2015,negative,my boyfriend wanted to see this movie more than i did and when we left the theater together with 20 minutes still on the clock by that time i think he enjoyed the movie less than i had what was george miller thinking when he decided to redo his original movie maybe it was to cover up the mel gibson controversy now he has another mess to dispose of like gibson or not and the original was a bit before my time the new mad max is one of the worst films i have ever seen i dont know what the lead actors names are and dont want to know either because  their completely uninspired performances have me wanting to forget everything about them oh charlize theron not my favorite and further down on the list after fury road the movie reminds me more of the italian knockoff films made to resemble mad max than the original mad max series of films action movies do not captivate my interest normally and this movie reinforced the norm
Oct 9 2015,negative,how the hell does this get 97   people opinions of movies have really taken a nosedive in the 2000s
Oct 9 2015,negative,just plain bad  not sure what the fuss was about      absolutely minimal exposition soso action it just feels so small scale and not particularly exciting
Oct 9 2015,positive,still missed the mark
Oct 9 2015,positive,i had read mixed reviews about the movie but wanted to watch it anyway and i really enjoyed it the cinematography was great i thought id like to see more mad max movies with tom hardy as he played the role really well charlize theron and nic hoult did a fine job as well
Oct 9 2015,negative,wtf  almost no dialogue thus pitched to lowest common denominator and international audiences who dont need to speak english to follow along  fast and furious in the desert  in other words another one for very very stupid people who dont like to think too much about stuff  turned it off after 20 minutes  will say i did laugh at the campy stupidness of the guy playing the guitar on top of a truck while they drove through the dessert  like a scene out of a very bad 80s music videomaybe thats giving it too much credit actually  rotten tomatoes has lost my trust in its rating system and i will forever look skeptically upon the tomatometer  thank you for listening
Oct 8 2015,positive,one of the best action movies ever made like pulp fiction the unforgiven or goodfellas this movie will become the standard of its odd genre
Oct 8 2015,positive,loved the little glimpse of life
Oct 7 2015,positive,omg very exiting and bizarre
Oct 7 2015,positive,if you didnt like this you dont like movies
Oct 7 2015,positive,great action must watch for action lovers
Oct 7 2015,negative,why did people like this so much
Oct 7 2015,positive,a masterclass of film making this is an action film with the right blend of carefully handled character development you are left to draw on your knowledge of mad max and his world to figure out how things stand it doesnt lack for story at all  it simply doesnt spoonfeed you i watched this a second time with my friend at the biggest imax in europe and i can safely say that it changed my outlook on action movies    so interesting to see the cyclical inspiration of max max  borderlands  mad max too
Oct 6 2015,positive,very fun if slightly overrated action movie
Oct 6 2015,positive,great action movie beautiful effects and cinematography
Oct 6 2015,positive,great action and a wonderful sense of time and place mad max builds its own world with finesse
Oct 6 2015,positive,this movie is an adreline action pack from begin to end and the new look to miller original franchise is greattheron played a good max and theron shes great as furiosayeah welcome back max
Oct 6 2015,positive,definitely one of the top movies of the year 
Oct 6 2015,positive,this movie has all the things i missed so much brutal dark and irredeemable world a ton of good elaborate details and many of talented actors more over a spirit of the old max not only was saved but imho became more strong
Oct 6 2015,positive,mad max furry road is a nonstop thrill ride but i only wish there was more story and character development
Oct 5 2015,neutral,for some reason this movie is wildly critically applauded well i know the reason the action sequences i will give it that are amazing so im sure anyone who loves very well choreographed action films will worship a great film like this but the problem i have with this movie is there is zero storyline it explores the character of nobody the talented tom hardy has no backstory or at least no backstory that is explained in this movie charlize therons  characteris a great one but the problem with her is right when you think youre starting to get to know her boom more explosions more fight sequences on the type of guy who likes movies with good storylines this film was lousy in my opinion
Oct 5 2015,positive,strange movie and depending on my mood i could go either way non stop action
Oct 5 2015,positive,batshit crazy awesome movie
Oct 5 2015,negative,no character development  whatever little immersion there is is stripped away whenever harding speaks  the sped up action sequences keep immersion at bay   the introduction doesnt leave you very impressed with hardings character so when we meet therons she isnt built up as a bad ass very well  as its rooted in her handtohand combat with max  as for world building spilling water are we to believe that anyone survives on such a brief outpour with so much lost to the ground  and what gasoline shortage  everyone and their grandmother seemingly literally has an engine in good working order and plenty of juice   wouldnt have cared less if max bought it didnt care when his car bought it  the actors just dont pull any of their scenes off   when the villain fixes to hate the heroes death of premature son it looks like he may of just called it a day silly mask didnt help the actor  when the young hottie takes to meaning business with watching the back or using a gun it doesnt even live up to the cliché    zero sexual tension throughout  the nux and redhead relation wasnt even sweet  again the scenes were weaker than the cliché   i dont even know any names besides nux and max  i did like the cinematography of the cool desert night  however this is where they hatched the idea of travelling 160 days on bikes  well maybe if they travelled a mile a day  and of course  in a postapocalyptic world that was short on gas beforehand there are plentiful bikes   in good working order  enough that the stranger guy gets  one laden with supplies and brimming with fuel  harding is either a bad actor or wrongly cast  mel gibson or any number of others would have shown guile when turning them all back towards the citadel a bit of sexual tension when the blonde was in tight beside him in the hatch and so on
Oct 5 2015,neutral,ok  sure  honestly im not really sure what the point of watching this movie is  its just weird and intense  not in an out and out bad way but not in a really compelling way either
Oct 5 2015,negative,mind numbing repetition  i dont understand how this film gets good reviews  the story is thin characters are thinner mostly this is two hours of car chases and crashes in the desert  it assumes too much  mad max was a character driven film where we see max go from a family man that wants to live in peace to his trial by fire towards the road warrior  by thunderdome we knew max so so it was the development of others against maxs foil that made the story  in this weak tale a warlord named joe keeps many wives and has many more sons  imperator furiosa helps several of joes wives escape while on a gas run  when furiosa takes a detour joe finds out immediately and engages in pursuit catching up quickly thus begins the bulk of the film an endless chase scene across the desert  youll notice ive said nothing of max as max appearance in this film is merely gratuitous  he really isnt needed except to convince furiosa to turn back to the citadel and that could have been done by any of the characters  this was not a worthy addition to the mad max universe  perhaps its time for the franchise to die  im glad i only paid 1 to see this
Oct 5 2015,positive,mad max is literally the best thing ever
Oct 5 2015,positive,not as good as they say
Oct 5 2015,positive,one of the best action movies ever the asset of the movie is that it relies more on the action than the story
Oct 5 2015,negative,what  totaling confusing could not figure the plotwaste of money and more importantly my time
Oct 5 2015,positive,action packed but lacks in storyline although makes up for the action scenes gripping throughout
Oct 4 2015,positive,sets a whole new standard for action films with an unrelenting pace and truly original visuals exhausting in the best possible way id see it again
Oct 4 2015,positive,not even halfway through my first viewing of this fantastic film i knew it will be an instant cult classic wont be surprised to see it on best of the year best of the decade best ever lists  it watches more like a music video especially when compared to the early mad max films
Oct 4 2015,negative,i did not see the other films and this is the worst movie of 2015 in my opinion
Oct 4 2015,negative,acting and story are paper thin and the action doesnt pick up until the second half mad max him self doesnt have any personality so you dont connect with his character at all forgettable unless you spent full price on this then you will be mad for a minute
Oct 4 2015,negative,i honestly dont see what it is everyone who loves this movie sees in it its like eating the worlds best hotdog but its just a hotdog
Oct 4 2015,positive,theres a lot of good about this movie  its a great looker with a great aesthetic and feel  theres action guns drugged up skinheads who want to rush to valhalla or in otherwords death post apocalyptic setting it has a ton of things going for it but the issue is theres no story or characters  the story is just a simple chasemovie main character get caught after which he escapes from being a bloodbag skinheaded druggies need his blood to continue functioning while accidentally meeting up with a truck full of women who are escaping from the cult leader of the skinheaded druggies theyre trying to escape to eden which by the words of furiosa the manly woman who kicks ass is a green land from which she was stolen from  thats it for the story 80 of the movie is about getting to that place while fighting lots of skinheads in crazy spiky cars  characters also arent built up max is the blandest of characters his character is literally just looking at things angrily and shooting at them occasionally sees phantoms of his daughter show up which isnt explained at all in the movie and shoots more people  furiosas reasons for escaping are explained and thats also literally to save other girls not really a character trait that has much to it and otherwise shes also similar to the main character a hardass who gets shit done    and there comes the issue you will feel interested in sidecharacters that come from the enemy side because theres simply no reason to like the main characters until the end i was actually cheering for the enemies because hey they were interesting there was literally a guitar guy who sat on a huge truck which had huuuge speakers and was shooting out fire from his guitar thats badass immortan joe also looks like a barely alive bulgy old man whos like go to valhalla now which is again pretty neat    but this movie although it isnt horrible theres nothing great about it its a solid 60 imho its being kept up by its licence and style but half of the movie is simply less than mediocre
Oct 4 2015,positive,i cant put my love into words i apologize
Oct 4 2015,positive,there is nothing i can say bad great job george miller
Oct 4 2015,positive,just one long car chase expected a lot more
Oct 4 2015,positive,was reluctant to go see a retread but well worth it  over the top action script costumes and stunts  top to bottom a well done movie  if they made more remakes like this we would be saying wow that was better than the original  in this case it was
Oct 4 2015,positive,meh it was ok the end sucked quite a lot
Oct 4 2015,positive,what a fucking perfect movie beginning to end this film does not cease to amaze
Oct 3 2015,positive,one of the best action movies of the last ten years  thin on character and plot but the action barely stops and stays interesting and fun the entire way through
Oct 3 2015,positive,i have to say this franchise is better without mel gibson
Oct 3 2015,negative,terrible 15 minutes of decent movie but mostly a 2 hour car chase with no plot whatsoever  absolutely terrible  i want the last two hours of my life back
Oct 3 2015,negative,good special effects but not good enough to make up for the horrible story waste of time i have no idea how this movie received the reviews it did childish story not worth the red box fees even
Oct 3 2015,negative,not sure why the reviews were so i but our family new there was going to be hard to watch within the first 5 minutes
Oct 2 2015,negative,very average movie to say the lest to many floors
Oct 2 2015,positive,a solid and exciting action picture tom hardy is good as mad max but his performance seems shallow compared to that of mel gibson in the first three films charlize theron is the real star of this movie but even her performance seems to lack any of subtleties brought to the earlier films in the series by gibson definitely well worth watching and a worthy addition to the genre of postapocalyptic action films
Oct 2 2015,positive,fury road is the rare movie that wastes nothing not a character not a crazy vehicle not a scene not a single action is this film is done for no reason everything is put to absolute perfect use as we watch amazing practical action play out in a visually cohesive way but miller doesnt let the audience get tired he throws in scenes of tension character and emotional weight to round out the glorious apocalyptic spectacle after watching it three times in three days i loved it even more the last time
Oct 2 2015,positive,one another film  but 45
Oct 2 2015,neutral,at best should be only a 50 out of 100 tomatoes
Oct 2 2015,positive,having watched the first one provided some context to maxs hallucinations but if you havent seen any of them this would still be enjoyable  i havent seen any of the other ones so cant say if they would provide any additional context  the action sequences were amazing which made up most of the film  this is a movie i wish i had seen in the theater
Oct 2 2015,positive,full throttle spectacular
Oct 1 2015,positive,a thrill ride from beginning to end with the best creative action sequences involving vehicles after 30 years since the original trilogy this movie is a true upgrade utilizing modern movie tech to its fullest with apocalyptic pacing
Oct 1 2015,positive,about as good as a remake will ever be
Oct 1 2015,negative,very boring and ridiculous and disgusting
Oct 1 2015,positive,best movie of the year
Oct 1 2015,positive,70yearold george miller undoubtedly destroys every other summer blockbuster of 2015 with tom hardy wonderfully taking over the role of mad max from mel gibson
Oct 1 2015,positive,insane in a very good way
Oct 1 2015,positive,well done action movie to the end kept to the true nature of the mad max genre
Oct 1 2015,positive,quite possibly my favorite action film ever
Oct 1 2015,positive,charlize theron steals the film although this was just a giant car chase i was not bored one second
Sep 30 2015,negative,not a patch on originals silly film
Sep 30 2015,negative,i rented this movie becuse of how great the ratings werewow i really sucked no back storyhardly anyone talked and it was just one big car chaseatleast that girl got run overit was the best partthis movie was highly overrated
Sep 30 2015,positive,if youre a max fan buckle up because this is an epic movie if your not a fan of vehicle destruction move along
Sep 30 2015,negative,this movie has 97 critical consensus on rottentomatoes so im a bit sad to be joining the 3 who didnt like this movie    its not for some of the reasons ive seen floating around  its a mad max movie in name only since furiosa is the real star the iconic car is barely in it then destroyed theres no mel gibson and whatever else  i remember liking beyond the thunderdome when i saw it but i wouldnt call myself a max aficionado for these details to really matter    i just didnt like it because i was bored  2 hour movie and all but 30 minutes of it is car chases  they were well filmed and choreographed and all but that wasnt enough to make me car about any of the characters or stop me from looking at my watch in desperation wondering if this thing was ever going to end    im just glad i didnt see this in theaters
Sep 30 2015,positive,truly a masterpiece
Sep 30 2015,positive,a nearly perfect action film in that it is beautiful entertaining smart and full of social commentary
Sep 29 2015,positive,surprisingly goodi still didnt get the point of the movie
Sep 29 2015,positive,max rockatansky you know hope is a mistake if you cant fix whats broken youll uh youll go insane    review soon
Sep 29 2015,positive,i would have to say he is not mel but he did a good job   i would watch this one again
Sep 29 2015,positive,the plot is not the selling point but watching vehicles race for excitement in a desert apocalyptic wasteland with tom hardy is totally worth the pay
Sep 29 2015,negative,wow what a waste of two hours and five bucks
Sep 29 2015,positive,the best action flim of summers 2015 movies made by a grandpa
Sep 29 2015,positive,what the heck was this movie not knowing what to expect i was pleasantly surprised fun movie
Sep 29 2015,positive,thats action movie
Sep 29 2015,positive,exciting barely any dialogue and a lot of driving if it was t for a friend to bring it over id would never watched it
Sep 29 2015,positive,it had lots of action but i still didnt like it that much it has that super fine ass charlize theron in it but she looked almost unrecognizable in this movie lol
Sep 29 2015,negative,mad max fury road not bad if your a gamer reminds you of an action game except it lacks their depth thankfully this stinking piece of fetid australian desertbaked roadkill was a free redbox 8310 on imdb and an 87 on rotten tomatoes i want the two hours and 5 iq points back dont bother
Sep 28 2015,positive,what a lovely movie what a lovely lovely movie d
Sep 28 2015,positive,stick with it its ok in the end
Sep 28 2015,positive,there will be those that watch this movie and are left wondering what the hell did i just watch  and to be sure george miller can be an acquired taste  but i would suggest you try desperately to acquire it because the flavors are transcendent  the postapocalypse has never looked so good  this film is simply gorgeous to look at  sure there will be some film snobs tired of the increasingly more common orangeblue palette but it plays to great effect here  and it makes the chrome so shiny  miller has created yet another wonderfully bizarre fictive reality rich with original characters  if there is to be one criticism of the film it would be that it should drop the mad max moniker and simply call itself fury road as max himself plays much more as a supporting character indeed he spends much of the film as a hood ornament  the real lead in this film is charlize therons furiosa and theron infuses her performance with such a cool badassery that she seems to be channeling ellen ripley sarah conner and beatrix kiddo all at once  the best advice i can give anyone just now diving into the world of george miller is that its going to be weird it doesnt have to make sense and its ok to laugh and have fun
Sep 28 2015,neutral,combine vanishing point the original monster trucks and heavy metal stir well shoot with color blind cameras add charlize theron in another character unrecognizable as her and up pops mad max fury road     if youve got a home theater with a good subwoofer you might want to tie down any loose objects
Sep 28 2015,positive,action packed with a flamethrowing guitarbass
Sep 28 2015,positive,2 hours of edge of your seat holy fucking shit amazing bring a friend and if they dont want to come fuck em bring a couple of drinks and cheer your way through the chaos i had a great time and it was perfect in every way    if i had one criticism i feel like charlize theron should of showed up to the gig hungover and looking more like shit she really didnt match the aura of the movie a little more back story to her even a tease might of been good but that wouldnt of quite matched her im really unhappy with this hairstyle i just paid 200 for demeanour afaik if shed been as rough as the movie was it could of been the best action movie of all time
Sep 28 2015,positive,i watched mad max after having heard from nearly everywhere that it was one of the best action movie ever made although the 2 hours was filled with very few dialogues and a lot of pursuits and violence i dont know actually what to say on the topic because the world in which the action take place is very accurately built and also the character has the same great characterization both the main and the secondary the rythm never falls and also in the moments of calm you feel that something will roar back soon there is a total lack of humanity in most of the characters as well and this give you a strange feel for all the vision from here to say that is the best action movie ever made probably passes a lot and i will not express my opinion on this
Sep 28 2015,positive,i really enjoyed the action pack adrenaline pump fury as the title suggests i was fully entertained throughout the end all the romance junkies looking for a love fest this film is not for you
Sep 27 2015,positive,this movie was awesome definitely the most metal thing ive seen since megadeth and slayer came to town
Sep 27 2015,positive,this film is just one hell of a thrill ride  lots of great edgeofyourseat action scenes  incredibly well done
Sep 27 2015,negative,never had more of a discrepancy between my opinion and the popular opinion i gave it a chance but this is terrible
Sep 27 2015,positive,visually striking and action packed very interesting and immersive worldcharacters lots of things to enjoy upon rewatching
Sep 27 2015,positive,the original mad max film trilogy of the late 1970s to mid 1980s have long endured as classic dystopian science fiction movies they made a star of mel gibson and gave us the unforgettable image of tina turner in a chainmail cocktail frock i was a little sceptical at yet another reboot of an old movie franchise thereve just been so many disappointing ones churned out over the years here however we have a great movie that not only honours the originals but could almost fit easily between any of them in style it is more like the first mad max movie it is graphically violent and filled with some great car chase and stunt sequences the character of max now played by tom hardy is almost an antihero and says very little indeed much of the action and plot centres on charlize therons character imperator furiosa a onearmed oil tankerdriving rebel who is trying to rescue a group of concubines from the evil clutches of a local warlord theres a definite feminist undercurrent to this movie and the female characters are refreshingly strong for a movie of this genre it is telling that george miller the original director of the series has returned to his baby and taken it forward he has managed to recreate the visual feel as well as the spirit of his groundbreaking stories and clearly has a tight control over his vision this is a real edge of your seat movie gripping good fun and i really would like to see where the road warrior ends up next hopefully the rumours of more adventures to come are actually true
Sep 27 2015,negative,i look to rotten tomatoes to provide me with expert movie reviews in this case i think their rating of 97 must have been influenced through bribery mad max 2015 was visually an ugly movie with stupid dialog and unrealistic special effects the original mad max w mel gibson remains a mustsee classic
Sep 27 2015,positive,brillant action spectacular special effects
Sep 27 2015,positive,this is one of the finest action movies i have laid my eyes upon it stayed true to what mad max is while making it fresh and new the acting is incredible and the practical effects are amazing if you have not seen this you need to do yourself a favor and watch this masterpiece
Sep 27 2015,positive,i was really surprised by how boring this film was  also the first time i wasnt astounded by tom hardy charlize theron has always been overrated
Sep 27 2015,positive,tom hardy is the right guy to replace mel gibson as mad maxcharlize theron was great as ferouzaaction from beginning to endvisuals are awsome
Sep 27 2015,negative,this movie is epic trash one long cgi car chase i would ban this movie from life itself for having less plot development than walle
Sep 27 2015,positive,easily the best movie of the year if not decade easy to watch easy to understand easy to enjoy i think the negative ratings come from pretentious people who either must feel unique in any way possible or their taste in entertainment is unreliable
Sep 27 2015,positive,this is a piece of a big and gigantic monstrous action movie that gives you the feel that you are inside the film together with the cast
Sep 27 2015,positive,one word to describe this flickintense visually stunning action packed 2 hour music video it barely gives you time to catch your breath
Sep 26 2015,negative,i hadnt seen previous mad max films and that may be why i found this empty story of a movie to be completely soulless it was just an endless car chase sequence involving characters that i could not have cared less about wish i had just skipped it
Sep 26 2015,positive,mad max is some horrible fun and from the very beginning delivered much fire to burn gaping mouths in awe with intense sequences built with practical effects george millers latest entry to his franchise is sure to bring new fans to his club as he pleases those already in
Sep 26 2015,positive,an interesting thriller
Sep 26 2015,negative,worst movie ever how this can even be compared to the first mad max is just insulting
Sep 26 2015,positive,quite the action ride though at times it really does look like the movies a vehicle to build cool cars trucks and motor cycles
Sep 26 2015,positive,even at the beginning theres no hint mad max fury road is going to a stop right at the very start the engines are already rewing gathering furious fires of vengeance and redemption and before the audience could snap out of the sheer moments of brutal grittiness and exhilarating highoctane drama they are surely already held hostage within the confines of a postapocalyptic world where everything is horrendously scarce not that its a bad thing no its not i tell you this is like being hurled into the space in a rollercoaster ride its dangerous but its also thrilling witnessing this dystopic world and all its hellish drama unfold might make you grope for seatbelt under your seat    the film shares max rockatanskys tom hardy adventures max is an ex highway patrolman hes been haunted by the past by family he never saved he meets the imperator furiosa charlize theron who is being pursued by the dictatorial wasteland leader joe furiosa reaches for max for help in keeping the five wiveswomen she brought with herinto safety as joes deranged breed of warriors called the war boys that are barely humans are raging across the desert to capture them this pursuit throws the unlikely partners into the whalloping dangers of bloody escape suddenly sending them into a game of survival    after a riproaring opening chase sequence max is held captive in the citadel the city where the ruthlessly totalitarian leader joe is ruling over the grotesquely brutal lord maintains tight grip of every valuable resouces across the land this brings the entire populace crippling under his control as for max he becomes merely a blood bag for nux nick hoult one of joes war boys who is a fatal devout to the cause of their fascist leader who has promised them the glory of getting into valhalla the promised land    everything in this cinematic behemoth screams grandeur even the feverish chase even the dark erubescents spurred from the ruthless violence miller has molded a world where darkness is an escape from the stream of clichés and retreads surging into the cinemas today its a visual feast but surprisingly with sense its explosive in every unimaginable ways but its not devoid of a human story which in this case is propelled by stellar performances from incredible actors on the movies payroll tom hardy is utterly capable as the main hero but the emotional spine of the narrative mostly runs on therons character at some point there would be a sense that max isnt the only one playing under the spotlight as it gets evident furiosa is equally as massive as his role is hardy here is singularly stunning playing his role with utmost credibility as he is required his mission transcends past his emotional torments and hes never pulled himself free from the ghosts if his past same can be said with furiosa who is not only running from joe because she wants to get herself free from his cut throat grip but also to bring every woman into safety back to freedom where they belong    much of the movie is spent with furious speed chases that goes from end to end of joes subjugated land while also taking surprising twists and turns along the way its like it doesnt know how to stop and if it does thats surely only to allow us breathe and catch up with the next electrifying action setpiece theres an enigmatic style miller has employed to provide distinctions in his fantasy world and it keeps the momentum in tack if not ever progressing the tone of the movie all those vividly dark colors that magically shifts from something to another imparts a drowning experience only its enjoying and looks festive to the eyes this makes every eyesquashing spectacles take mammoth forms of visual extravaganza turning all those burning combustions metal blasts and endless pursuits from mere technical marvels into a hairraising escapade    amid these sanitygrabbing action sequences though is an emotional streak that keeps max and furiousas humanity alive this prompts them to survival into carrying out their similar humane causes clinging tightly to their only mission even if they get hurled into the barbaric hostilities of their dystopian society this turns the movie into something visceral cathartic in some ways that probably only a small fraction of the audience could understand it will not be enough to merit this achievement with merely a splurge of superlatives this needs to be experienced felt and forever cherished mad max fury road ignites eternal fire and it will keep burning through the stretches of cinematic history
Sep 26 2015,positive,just watched this today i really enjoyed the movie but i feel the focus was not about max i am okay with this because the action and story line kick it when it comes to car chases in movies these days i usually fastforward or go to get more soda i really enjoyed how the action during the chases worked into the plot fun movie
Sep 26 2015,positive,it was a good movie but not as good as the original mad max and nowhere as good as the road warrior
Sep 26 2015,negative,absolutely terrible
Sep 26 2015,positive,first things first i have to rant a little bit about something thats been bothering me since i finished watching this film last night  and that is the reaction to the film among mens rights activists or mras  now the very idea of mens rights activism is an absolutely preposterous one since and think about this what rights dont men have  think about it what rights are these men actually fighting for  what rights dont men have  specifically white men  but anyway the reaction to this film was very negative despite many of them not actually having seen the movie because of the feminist agenda by having a forced female character in imperator furiosa  i guess the complaint comes in the fact that these men believe that women in action movies arent allowed to be badasses because real women take a subservient role to men  either that or theyre damsels in distress or theyre the romantic interest for the male lead  these men have got clearly defined roles for women and being strong leaders isnt one of them at least in films  even if the film had a forced female character which it doesnt as the lead and the one that really drives the narrative forward it wouldnt be a legitimate complaint  its not like they make a big deal of imperator furiosa being a woman at any point in the film  the film just tells its story and lets its characters speak for themselves  the film having a strong female lead isnt a valid complaint and it will never be because you are focusing on the gender of the person playing the character and not on the content of the film  so mras and their opinions about this film are not valid and they are human filth  why would you listen to human filth    with that out of the way and i do apologize for that but i really had to get it out of my chest i was honestly really fucking looking forward to this film ever since i first saw the trailer late last year  i really like the original trilogy  the road warrior or mad max 2 if i were to compile a list of my favorite action movies would place very very highly on that list  like maybe top 3  i thought that mad max beyond thunderdome was a huge disappointment but that was probably because of george millers lessened involvement  it just wasnt as good as the previous two films in the trilogy  but ever since i saw the road warrior i absolutely fucking loved it  so when fury road was finally announced for release almost 30 years after the last mad max movie came out i was super excited yet also careful in my expectations cause the reality mightve been that this movie might not have ever matched up to the road warrior  well im here to say this film was pretty much everything it shouldve been and even then some  you know how i said that the road warrior was one of my favorite action films ever  well i can definitely say the same about this film  its really that fucking great  itd be one thing if it was just for the actionchase sequences which are out of this fucking world but the film also has a surprisingly good interesting narrative with some really strong character development for furiosa nux and max  heres the thing about max while the series is named after his character since the road warrior all he has been is a pawn in someone elses game  hes a means to an end for some of these people so thats why i wasnt bothered that max while still an integral part to the proceedings took a backseat to furiosa because her story to save the wives of immortan joe from sex slavery is the driving force of the film  nothing happens without her involvement  honestly furiosa herself is a fucking badass  i dont give a shit if the mras hate me for it but shes one of the better characters in any action movie since probably the bride from kill bill  notice how both those characters are women gasp  shes strong and vulnerable all at the same time like you know theres something about her past that simply fucked her up for life and her actions during the film is sort of her way to redeem herself for what mightve happened  max is also haunted by the past and the people that he failed to protect that ended up dying and how thats the reason that he usually goes off on his own rather than stick to a group  contributing to furiosas quest to free the brides also offers him a chance at redemption  though i do think nux is the more surprising of all the newer characters at least from how he transitions from one type of character to something completely different  nux is essentially a war boy essentially a fancy name for cannon fodder for immortan joe  nux wants desperately to reach valhalla a place where warriors who dies in combat reach in the afterlife imagine like a heaven or something  pretty much everything about nux is about reaching valhalla because this is all he knows and all that immortan joe has taught him  so seeing him evolve as a character is really interesting and nicholas hoult is great in the role   charlize theron is also pretty incredible as imperator furiosa as she surprisingly plays the character very subtly  by that i mean the fact that she never hams it up like theres much more to the furiosa character than what you actually see onscreen  and thats something that is hopefully explored upon if ever a furiosa prequel ever gets greenlit  tom hard is always amazing so no complains here but max is a character that never says or emotes much  have i mentioned how amazing the chase sequences are in this movie  like the first extended action sequence of the film is one of the best you will see this year or ever for that matter  the beauty about a film like this is that with very few exceptions its all actually taking place with real vehicles  theres some computer generated crashes here and there but by an large its actually taking place and that means that it has so much more impact than it wouldve otherwise  the visual of the apocalyptic dust storm is a sight to behold  i cant even explain how much detail there is in this one desert storm scene with fire tornadoes and shit  its a visual feast for the eyes honestly  something tells me that technically this scene was probably a bitch to put together  the spectacle of this dustelectrical storm has to be seen to be believed  its stuff like that that puts this film over the top  the chase sequences in this film are some of the best ever seen on film  find me a film with better chase sequences than the road warrior or fury road  i got all fucking day  the costume design is obviously excellent  no one does postapocalyptic costume design better than mad max  the road warrior pretty much set the standard of what postapocalyptic costume design looks like  the climactic action sequence is also out of this world  the action in this film is worldclass  and of course the editing has to be topnotch as well in order for it all to make sense from a visual standpoint  theres so many things going on from a visual perspective in this film that the editing needs to be especially commended because of the difficulties in placing this all together to where it looks amazing to a viewing audience  so margaret sixel the editor of the film deserves a standing ovation for her work here  i tip my hat off to you madam  but perhaps what i like most about the film is sort of the little moments of character development that you get in between the action sequences  like how theres a certain respect thats building up between furiosa and max throughout the film  they dont do it in a heavyhanded fashion but you can notice the respect building between the two  the interactions between the wives and the gang of women is really cool as well  those small little moments of character development is what makes this film and the world feel so fully developed  its a dark and brutal world to live in and the film does a fabulous job at representing that  with that said i fucking loved this film if you couldnt tell  my favorite of the year so far and one of the best action films ive ever seen  though its so much more than just an action film  thats one of the beautiful things about it  i obviously highly recommend this film  long live imperator furiosa        and fuck the mras
Sep 26 2015,negative,well i watched it again i am still not impressed with this movie i see tons of action movies i love them yes the visual effects were amazing but the rest of the movie falls flat lame dialogue lame characters etc one of the villains is a fat guy with an oxygen really i was happy with the story until everyone decided opps lets turn around and go back the exact way we can for the past hour and a half of the movie wtf weak story where did the ambino war children come from why is there no towns other than a gas town even shanties would make sense of the story world story world environment was lame also desert more desert i know it was a post nuclear war world but there could have been more than what we were given anyone see oblivion way way way better story world environment i would love to know how people this is an action masterpiece must not have seen john wick lucy the new mi movie which are all 20x better than this overrated
Sep 26 2015,positive,one of those films that  much like the turbo charged mega speakers and flame throwing electric guitar torch the earth in pitchperfect action a revelry drum charging into new territory
Sep 26 2015,positive,rip roarin good time from the word go quite intense
Sep 26 2015,positive,the movie is an allout blast that will leave you in awe even months after seeing it practical effects look amazing and the stunts are extremely well done the only thing keeping this review from a 5star rating is an overall lack of focus on the plot but thats excusable due to how entertaining the film is
Sep 26 2015,positive,this movie delivers from the beginning to the very end complete madness and raw explosive action everything you could ask for in a quality actionadventurehorror flick charlize theron and tom hardy go together like peanut butter and jellylike white on rice
Sep 26 2015,positive,as messed up as the original no storyline but was still a good action film carexplosions were brilliant
Sep 26 2015,positive,spectacular pictures and convincing actors as well as incredibably costum character design the whole plot catched me right from the beginning and kept me exciting until the end additionally i can suggest it people who didnt like the previous mad max movies nice soundtrack as well
Sep 26 2015,positive,best action movie possibly ever
Sep 26 2015,positive,2 hours of mindless violence crazy car stunts and bgrade thin plots enjoy it semi drunk
Sep 25 2015,positive,ok it was a really strange weird and creepy action movie i think lots of people didnt like it but i liked it george miller the witches of eastwick babe lorenzos oil happy feet is my favorite director mad max 2 was like this and thats his aussie style action best performer was charlize theron she was calm cool and wonderful tom hardy was cool too nicholas hoult about a boy warm bodies xmen days of future past looked different and he did nice performance first i thought story is boring but climax car chase action sequences were really dynamic heart pounding and fantastic 3d effects were really vivid colorful and amazing ending was great if you like car action movies you should watch it 3d is better
Sep 25 2015,negative,meaninglessly gory depressing ugly and bereft of substance this movie was by far the most torturous two hours of my lifetwo hours that i regret that i will never have back and ive had a sigmoidoscopy before the characters have about as much backstory and dimension as a toothpick and the mindless action is stupefyingly dull while i can never unwatch this overrated drivel i sincerely hope that my review will help you recover two hours of your life
Sep 25 2015,positive,witness this movie if you havent already as someone completely new to mad max i was thoroughly surprised at how much i loved it now i gotta see the first three
Sep 25 2015,negative,am i the only person that thinks a chase to the middle of the desert only to turn around and go back is a non plot  loved the first two in the series third and fourth very disappointing  this was visually very well done so that brings the second star
Sep 25 2015,negative,very disapointing lots of movement but no substance people who say that this movie is feminst totally miss the point of feminism
Sep 25 2015,positive,strap on the ole feed bag and sit back and enjoy the show fun to watch all the way around gonna have to watch it again to see what i missed easily one of the best pure action movies probably ever that is all it is and that is all it needs or wants to be
Sep 25 2015,negative,this was the biggest waste of two hours ive spent in a long time if youre into meaningless undeveloped characters over the top props ridiculously impossible in the real world action and shootings cgi generated stunts and almost no plot this is your movie from the first moment of the movie till the end its nonstop explosions chase scenes and gunfire thanks but ill just play call of duty when i want to watch insane action
Sep 25 2015,positive,there is literally nothing to hate about this movie its got immense action sequences a strong script relatable characters and a gorey charm to it its truly what a blockbuster summer movie is ment to be1
Sep 25 2015,neutral,sorry just such a fan of the originals
Sep 25 2015,positive,none stop action through and through acting is great cinematography was fantastic the effects were amazing definitely the best movie to come out of summer 2015
Sep 25 2015,positive,the rush my god the rush although it doesnt provide character development or focus the rush flowed from start to end
Sep 24 2015,positive,there are moments in the history of our culture where we were blessed with something deserving of a title such as masterpiece for instance in music people generally hail michael jacksons thriller album worthy of masterpiece status with film the godfather comes to my mind this movie is no ordinary movie its a modern day masterpiece it breaks the mold of films and gives us something new something fresh there isnt a ton of dialogue from the main characters but the idea is that we dont need it in the first place just by looking at max you almost get this feeling that you know exactly what he is thinking at the time sorrow is portrayed beautifully in the little moments and happiness is resurrected in the end this movie allows for multiple viewings and you really should take advantage of it because this is no ordinary film this is a mad max film
Sep 24 2015,positive,anti mainstream action movie like the flamethrower guitar witness me
Sep 24 2015,positive,as a action packed movie this movie nailed it all the day with its incredible colourful visuals and lack of cgi the problem was that there wasnt much of mad max in this film than the other prequels which was very disappointing since the entire franchise is depicted on him instead the film shouldve been called furiosa fury road as she was mostly featured through out the film another point was the whole vehicle chase scene was just copied from the second and third installment with more gore and action though gotta give credit for those damn monstrous vehicles see my point is this movie was great and all but i would like to have seen more of mad max and a fresh unexpected story to start of the fourth installment after like what 25 years
Sep 24 2015,positive,it definitely lived up to the hype i would definitely recommend this if anyone was wanting to see it
Sep 24 2015,positive,for nearly 15 years have we only received a handful of action movies that have a well crafted source of action character and high octane storytelling fury road is one of those movies in terms of not only a film having a wide range of being able to show the action in a clear and clever way just like how christopher nolan revived and changed the superhero comic book genre as we know it today george miller has returned to revive and change the action movie genre that we know for the better
Sep 24 2015,positive,a mad max for the happy feet generation     71yearold director and writer george miller has taken a 30year hiatus from mad max but in 2015 max is back this is a completely reimagined postapocalyptic world  forget mel gibson tom hardy gives a fantastic performance as max hardy offered few lines of dialog but he spoke to the audience thorough his action  he also had help with his supporting cast of charlize theron and nicolas hoult giving equally as impressive contributions to their respective roles     for those of you who are familiar with the world of mad max you will get a pleasant surprise im not sure if it ever specified as to where in the world this film takes place but it looks a bit different than the original trilogy that being said it was a great improvement and for those of you who have never seen the old mad max or have even heard of the film you will also be presently surprised with a fantastic action film that ranks among the best ever made     furiosa theron is charged with taking a war machine to fill it up with gas when the self proclaimed god immortan joe figures out that she is going off course to escape with all of his wives he goes mad and follows after her with every car available in his kingdom  max is a captured blood bank for nux hoult  a driver trying to make his name know to immortan joe  braving through a giant sand storm it is a race against time for furiosa to escape with the other women      when the film is boiled down to its core it is a two and a half hour car chase on the back drop of an absolutely gorgeous desert landscapes including a giant sandstorm tornado and the best action set ever to be put on film     the effects are outstanding and realistic the acting is phenomenal and the cinematography is beautiful any action film fan will love this whether or not you are familiar with the mad max story  taking the time and money out of your day to see this film will be worth every cent
Sep 24 2015,positive,this movie scream and revs classic max vehicle rage
Sep 24 2015,positive,this is my first experience of the mad max franchise and had much to learn about its story this movie taught me all i needed to know and its a bizarre world full of character and stunning imagery its a strange movie but one that keeps up an impeccable pace and is full of brutal action really the whole movie feels like one massive racing scene and on reflection not much happens but the full 2 hours is a fully entertaining adrenaline rush im positive this is a movie which can be enjoyed by all due to its unique style and extensive entertainment value
Sep 24 2015,positive,absolutely amazing a thrill ride worth watching
Sep 24 2015,positive,the acting for the most part sucked specially the new max i think maybe another actor would have been a better choice  furiosa to me was almost like the main character of the movie  max felt like a secondary character only a few scenes reminds us that he is a tough guy not to mess with i wish there was more to the storyline and how they just turn around it is just dumb  now for the action scenes they were great  they got this right and this is why i gave it 3 out of 5  if you watched the old mad max movies you will enjoy the action sequences since the action is pretty much 95 of this movie  other than that you are going to be let down  in my opinion the old movies were the best ones but the action scenes on the this movie were actually better  another thing to add is that for an apocalyptic world they sure wasted ammo fuel and water
Sep 23 2015,positive,mad max fury road is easily one of the best movies of the year if not one of the best of all time with mostly practical effects which stand out among the crowded sea of cg action movies this movie arrives like a lighthouse in the dark as a refreshing sigh of relief for the action movie genre
Sep 23 2015,positive,weird movie this one sure theres a lot of action explosions and fire but what is it all about the acting is great and theron is awesome mad max hasnt got much lines oh well i stayed awake most of the time
Sep 23 2015,negative,loved the original but this new one sucked if it wasnt for me riding my fitness bike and burning 1400 calories while i watched this i wouldnt have gotten anything out of this movie
Sep 23 2015,positive,loosely based on true events great movie for the whole family
Sep 23 2015,negative,this was a tedious grungy chase  war movie that i couldnt wait to end  despite the good art direction  everyone looked like they just got back from burning man and charlize theron was a waste as an action star  im glad i saw it on dvd and didnt waste the money at a theater  im really amazed that so many critics liked this  im being generous with 2 stars  for the art direction  sorry but the rest was a bore 
Sep 23 2015,negative,hated the originals and hated this just as much yeah cool cgi effects cool costumes blah blah blah  just dont get it overall
Sep 23 2015,negative,this was really bad
Sep 23 2015,positive,nonstop exhilarating action must see succinct dialogue
Sep 23 2015,negative,no star so bad i couldnt finish  it   i feel sorry for the actors
Sep 23 2015,negative,very disappointing little in the way of plot max almost seemed like an extra rather than the star
Sep 23 2015,positive,finally a remake of the notorious and infamous post apocalyptic action film mad max fury road with a collage of profound creativity and limitless imagination george miller cast and crew deserve the industries most distinguished recognition for this incredible production from costume design to monstrous mutant machines to high risk stunts and a compelling score from the orchestra behind the scenes this film defies all the stigma of a typical monotonous sequel the film speed variations close ups and panning and zooming contributed significantly to the riveting and seamless action amazing aerial drone footage and natural settings excellent casting and authentic looking extras this film is a direct result of professionally coordinated hard work i thought there was just one element it couldve used tomorrows technology depicted as outdated technology solar panels hybrid and hydrogen energy cellular and uhf communications but there is a certain admiration for the dedicated old school discipline that is just not for sale if you went to see this movie expecting something resembling terms of endearment no one is interested in reading your review anyone fit to grant this movie with less than 45 stars can never appreciate what it takes to produce ten seconds of a specifically original feature action film like this one
Sep 22 2015,positive,one wordviolence    pure 100 unadulterated allamerican homegrown hollywood style violence enough story to make it a movie enough suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat enough action to keep you fixated and enough violence to keep your mind stimulated hollywood really outdid itself right down to the random faceless devil man playing his lead guitar on a moving stage serving absolutely no other purpose but to be an on the spot soundtrack to instigate more violence chaos and death     oh what a day what a lovely day
Sep 22 2015,positive,mad max fury road is confusing its unsettling and its absolutely entertaining even though this is a sequel george miller has given us the most unique film of 2015 it really is like nothing youve seen before plus this movie is filled to the brim with impressive practical effects and remarkable stunt work this is an adrenalinefueled ride through the mind of a crazy person and i was happy to be a passenger
Sep 22 2015,positive,i can certainly see why this got good reviews damn what a movie the action scenes in this were something else probably the best ive ever seen in a long time the bad guys looked menacing the visuals were stupendous even the old ladies in the final showdown kicked some serious ass i loved that there was a dude rocking out to some metal during the whole thing hah the only thing that kinda irked me a bit was how things were wrapped up so neatly at the end when they arrived back at the citadel but thats the only issue i really had and a very minor one at that im shocked i loved this when i found the original mad max trilogy tiresomei slept through every one im calling it now best movie of 2015
Sep 22 2015,negative,absolutely pointless
Sep 22 2015,negative,dumbest movie ive ever seen i dont know where these positive reviews are coming from aside from pot induced stupor bad acting stupidno dialog stupid plot etc you name the category  failure on all counts written and directed for low iq teenage boys
Sep 22 2015,negative,a waste of time  ultra violence and not much of a story
Sep 22 2015,positive,what a film what a lovely film
Sep 22 2015,positive,it lacks the plot of the other films but has the action and excitement of the chase
Sep 22 2015,neutral,was great fun for the first hour then became repetitive and dare i say boring
Sep 22 2015,positive,this was amazing a twohour chase movie with a feminist messege and nothing but action mad max is back best movie of 2015 so far by far
Sep 22 2015,positive,badass no stop action with an incredible blend of cgi and practical effects 1010 will watch every weekend
Sep 22 2015,positive,do i even have to say why this is one of the best action movie  if not the best action movie of the 2010s  it has tom hardy charlize theron and a guy playing an electric guitar with a stton of giant speakers in the back what a lovley movie
Sep 21 2015,positive,150 beautiful insanity    hunted by scavengers and haunted by his past max lives on the run like a lone wolf reduced to the single instinct of survival things however take a turn for the worse once he finds himself a prisoner of a citadel tyrannized by an evil warlord and must join a group of strangers in hopes of escaping out alive    from director george miller the original mastermind behind the mad max franchise comes a new postapocalyptic tale of vengeance and solidarity fueled with stylistic chaos and amped with 150 beautiful insanity mad max fury road is like a nitroboosted adrenaline rush straight to the head every shot was flawlessly staged lit and framed like an artistic photograph that simply screams pure genius this goes without mentioning the awesome heavy metalinfused orchestral score by junkie xl now some viewers might feel a little awkward accepting some of the steampunk attire eccentric props and unquestionably weird characters but they shouldnt be too quick to judge everything in the film no matter how odd has a sense of logic and a functional purpose to support its existence not only does this sensible approach make things feel more realistic but it also couldnt look more genuine thanks to the abundance of practical effects and real stunt work even more impressive is the clear dedication from our leading actors who performed the majority of their own stunts one fight sequence even resulted in tom hardy breaking his nose but judging by his interviews its pretty clear that everyones proud of what theyve accomplished      putting the films obvious strengths aside one of fury roads most impressive aspects is the technical brilliance behind the cinematography and editing itself regardless of how fastpaced some of the scenes were and how many quick cuts they included i never once had to struggle to process the visuals its safe to say that the director knew exactly how to frame the characters in each shot to ensure everything flowed together without nauseating the audience regardless of its highpaced action too bad most modern action movies arent competent enough to film and edit sequences this way maybe taken 3 rings a bell keep in mind viewers may find disappointment through the films relatively thin plot and lack of dialogue but one could easily argue that miller effectively makes up for this with his clever use of visual storytelling techniques i for one felt the characters actions spoke for themselves and am confident his storyboard based script had a lot to do with why this approach worked so well    this might be the 4th chapter in a preestablished saga but millar has proven his concept is far from dead and fury road completely justifies all the critical appraise its receiving with just enough nods to the originals to please diehard fans but more than enough fresh material to engage new audiences anyone getting on board is sure to enjoy the ride if its unique style or genuine originality isnt enough to catch your attention the high octane and unquestionably explosive action sequences are sure to blow you away
Sep 21 2015,positive,mad max fury road had a compelling story and the direction of the acting was extremely impressive
Sep 21 2015,negative,too silly and illogical
Sep 21 2015,positive,visual effects are so cool should change the title to crazy max
Sep 21 2015,negative,i tried to stick with it but had to bail i am in the minority but found it visually interesting yet because of everything else virtually unwatchable
Sep 21 2015,negative,what a crap story if it wasnt for the action this movie wouldnt have a leg to stand on lets hurry up and leave so we can go back wtf
Sep 21 2015,positive,i went into this movie with huge expectations which led me to be a bit underwhelmed when the movie was over this is a great first movie of a series if they continue it im sure they will story was just too basic for me and i would of enjoyed more variety of locations acting and special effects were done to perfection though 45
Sep 20 2015,positive,best of the year and in my top faves forever
Sep 20 2015,positive,wasnt a fan til now
Sep 20 2015,positive,amazing movie action packed likable characters and a story that wraps up nicely tom hardy and charlize theron deliver a wonderful performance
Sep 20 2015,positive,after what people say that mad max beyond thunderdome a disappointment i think george miller will make up for it with mad max fury road mad max fury road is currently my favorite action film ever made it is a modern action classic and easily the best film so far in 2015 it is a milestone in action film history tom hardy does a descent job as max rockatansky not as good as gibson but good enough for the film charlize theron is also very good i think furiosa will be an iconic female action character like ripley and sarah connor the action in this movie is some of the best ive ever seen with great stunt work and no terrible cgi like most action films these days if you want mindless action unlike the expendables or fast and the furious movies watch mad max fury road because it will give you an experience like no other
Sep 20 2015,positive,lets be honest nobody was asking for a reboot of mad max its one of those old scifi series that were good in the old days but no one really needed to see again fury road completely blew away all expectations easily one of the best films of the year it incorporated so much wellshot action and so much metacommentary on resource usage and womens rights that its amazing no one was clamoring for this sooner now everyone wants to be witnessed tom hardy was a solid choice to replace mel gibson but everyone knows that charlize theron was the true star of george millers return to prominence therons imperator furiosa  is easily the best written female action character of the last few years and honestly probably of all time her characters sole mission after achieving military greatness is to rescue immortan joes concubines from a lifetime of breeding her performance is both subtle and inyourface which is what pissed off the last remaining mens rights groups that still laughably fight for relevance theron deserves massive credit for bringing humanity to a world that is massively devoid of such things but george miller deserves so much credit for crafting this desolate world the action scenes are perfect the creative decisions are beyond impressive what with an entire vehicle dedicated to a guitarist and his wall of amps this film is mad impressive and goddamn i hope it gets a sequel
Sep 20 2015,positive,2 hours of non stop fun and excitement
Sep 20 2015,negative,critics gave this a 97 positive rating many were amazed at how charlize theron was transformed physically to play this role     pros  a possible new drinking game here every time you discover a really bad visual blunder or terrible editing job take a drink i guarantee youll see less than half the movie before youre passed out on the couch     another possible drinking gamecharlize theron is beyond beautiful for this role she cut all her hair off and rubbed axial grease on her face guess what its still fking charlize theron only with short hair and grease on her face so the drinking game is when you first realize youre looking at the transformed charlize start drinking and dont stop till you pass out unless you have the intellect of a grape thatll be in the first five minutes of the movie and youll be spared death by boredom which occurs within a half hour     positive note and suggestion its better to rent the streaming version as opposed to the less expensive physical dvd this will actually be less expensive in the long run having the actual physical dvd in front of you will give you the strong urge to destroy it and relieve the world of one copy of this crap     investors gave money to this project theyre out there and theyre giving money away     cons  writer has serious mother issues     this movie took two hours of my life which i will never get back
Sep 20 2015,positive,rip roaring good time
Sep 20 2015,positive,amazing action scenes but story is okay i love this move to death
Sep 20 2015,positive,well donemust see  very much in the same vain as the original movies
Sep 20 2015,positive,good film great action great effectsgreat acting and tom hardy plays max just as good as mel gibson did all those years ago 
Sep 20 2015,positive,while im not a fan of nonstop cgi action thrillers this is the exception seen in 3d the captivatingly bizzare guitarist  drummers in the chase add enough unreal humorous reliefs to made this an entertaining expetience  in spite of myself
Sep 19 2015,positive,mad maxfury roaddirected by george miller and starring tom hardy and charlize theronis the fourth installment in the mad max seriesits main focus is in a postapocalyptic wasteland where several people are fighting for rightsgasolineand survivalits the best film of 2015 so far and is an actionadventure masterpiecethe acting and direction is incrediblestunts and setsmakeup and costumessound and visualsand the script are all first class entertainment in my bookthis is how an action film should be madeeach characters motivation is fully realizedand we never lose track of what the story really meansi absolutely adore the chaotic value in this film
Sep 19 2015,negative,im a fan of tom hardy lawless but if it wasnt for the cool motorcycles and cars this movie would be an absolute total bust dont see it unless youre a die hard road warrior fan really unwatchable
Sep 19 2015,positive,this movie doesnt need any changes it is a simple story with loads of intense action so much fun
Sep 19 2015,positive,rivals the road warrior epic it could have used more max though
Sep 19 2015,negative,this movie was low iq lead footed garbage  proof the critics consensus is utterly void these days
Sep 19 2015,positive,now this is a blockbuster 2 hours flies by almost nonstop action incredible work by tom hardy and charlize theron  quite possibly best film of 2015 so far a really really compelling watch
Sep 19 2015,negative,utter utter garbage walked out dont care about the cinematic self backslapping it is absolute dross
Sep 19 2015,positive,this show reminds me of spongebob the movie
Sep 19 2015,negative,nothing but a disgusting film how do you mess up mad max with this trash you have people doing hannibal acts among other shit things i would never let a kid watch this
Sep 19 2015,positive,probably the most insane highrisked timeconsuming overtheedge action film ive ever seen george miller really steps it up in the making the most eyepopping mad max film since its time during this film i didnt react to it maybe not quite as well as i expected but after it all i was pretty well convinced and had that slight feeling of so much going on that youd want to see it over again to catch more of it i usually felt that going from one camera shot to the next was a bit overbearing but most of the good parts during the road raging scenes were captured well and people getting the basic gist of it in reality i wouldnt consider it the best action movie ever made but probably not the best action movie ever made it was still much well done and quite enjoyable enough though
Sep 19 2015,neutral,tom hardy cant act he basically grunted his way through the film which just felt like a long version of the end chase scene from the road warrior     miller tries to capture the torment that the original max films had but fails because the flash backs dont really connect to the characters they are supposed to represent or at least i assume they represent  his wife and child who were killed in the first film     ultimately though you end up just feeling tired and bored as max seems to find some redemption or a kindred soul in therons character but instead he walks away again to wander the desert with his torment this was fine in the original max movies but at this point you just feel like someone should kill him and put him out of his misery a la gladiatorbut then that would be cliche as well     too bad
Sep 19 2015,positive,postmodern feminism in the postapocalypse good but not great would have rated worse were it not for some cool vehicles a bit of a disappointment
Sep 19 2015,negative,what did i just watch  and how was it rated 97 on rotten tomatoes
Sep 18 2015,positive,fury road inevitably reminds me a lot of the 2012 film dredd with which it shares many feminist undertones both films are part of a small but steadily growing subgenre of rrated action films that are uncommonly inclusive towards female audiences  and why the hell shouldnt they be yes its true these films are hardly the sort that youd suggest to just anyone  the violence alone is something that not every viewer can stomach but for those who already enjoy violent action films the need for a more progressive approach than the usual machomasculine type is all too apparent after all the action genres core demographic is not as maleheavy as hollywood would have us believe and it hasnt been for a very long time  movies like fury road dredd and kill bill are simply acknowledging that at least half their viewership is not male  these films dont needlessly alienate female viewers with what i think we can all agree is lazy writing this film inparticular goes a little father than dredd in terms of creating a plot that legitimately subverts harmful gender stereotypes  while keeping in perfect consistency with its postapocalyptic patriarchy backdrop  all in one fell swoop this movie genuinely gives me hope for the future of the action genre as a whole    full review here  
Sep 18 2015,positive,great movie following right in the footsteps of the classic
Sep 18 2015,negative,mad max was not the main character furiosa was the main character
Sep 18 2015,positive,full review at wordsonfilmscom     i dont usually go in for action films but fury road isnt like most action films its tighter its bolder its smarter this fearless and exceptionally memorable film puts the pedal to the metal in just about every way and the result is a film that puts the rest of its genre to shame first and foremost fury road is a highoctane visual spectacle but its also masterfully crafted work of cinema so if nearly 2 hours of car chases guns and destruction sounds at all playedout or uninteresting to you think again
Sep 18 2015,negative,i like dumb moviesa lotthis movie was awful  good cinematography lame movie
Sep 18 2015,positive,no plot but the best action movie of the year and all real stunts
Sep 18 2015,positive,the action sequences are fast paced  the visualization is stunning  the screen presence of tom hardy and charlize theron binds you to the seats this 2 hours straight post apocalyptic thriller is deeply entertaining
Sep 18 2015,positive,i would best compare this film to another film that came out in 2013 by the name of gravity gravity much like the film im reviewing right now was a spoon fed overly praised film that places more value on aesthetics than it does on engaging characters or a worthwhile story to be invested in just like gravity one bewilderment towards the overwhelming positive reception versus the actual quality of the film shouldnt be a surprise since if you remove the technical achievement all youll have left is superficial entertainment with a two hour car chase its a dumb action film with a high budget and cool car stunts which is sadly all it has to offer    around this portion of my reviews i would provide a synopsis of mad max fury road but any sort of synopsis should be considered a spoiler theres very little plot in the film that required three writers to create to put it in perspective the film without giving away thin specifics is basically like driving a couple miles away from your home to get water while being chased by lunatics remembering theres no longer anyone guarding your home for some reason and returning home the same way you came even though it was blocked after an explosion that is all that occurred within two hours like mentioned before this took the effort of three writers to create is pretty pathetic not just in writing but filmmaking as a whole    its titled character max is a man of few words fewer defining characteristic beside having a tortured past and less of an engaging character max is relegated to a supporting role who just goes with the motion of events some attempts are made in providing a backstory to max but it is thinly stretched out all that is told about max through hallucination is that he failed to protect people their importance is never specify almost as if discluding any newcomer in the franchise if it fails to stand alone as it own entity then it failed before filming began nope instead of providing stronger context its better if that time was better spent on very long car chases instead    more ridiculous than the thinness of the story is the presentation of serious moments car chases take up 90 of the film are bombastic and loud which when applied to a character furiousa talking about redemption cant be taken seriously thats the clear points of these moments though once again i want emphasize it took three people to write this story without much exploration into character backgrounds it further deteriorate into an eye candy spectacle that only manages to hold your attention because of it belief it would lose its audience if there wasnt a extensive car chase for every few minutes focus on plot    the film opens up with our main character max being captured and in an attempt to escape shows to the viewers how insane the world is this very early scene shows a crowd of people gathering around to get water with the images presenting a clear picture of how important this resource is in the world yet the three writers felt the imagery of this scene wouldnt be enough to convey the desperation in its world either being water healthy people or fertile land which is why lines like as the world fell each of us in our ways were broken is spoon feeding to the definition much like the example i use in the opening paragraph if it was entirely muted were talking about virtually no dialogue the film would actually be an achievement in storytelling regardless if it needed to use simple caricatures for an action movie unfortunately with spoon fed dialogue like that its a blessing and a curse the characters dont talk as much as they do taking away from the experience    characters are simplified to very basic character arcs most notable examples comes in the form of nux and furiousa nux wants to be taken to vahala which loosely can be tied to religion as much as furiousa search for redemption from an event thats makes a very loose connection with the antagonist nux doesnt suffer as much as furiousa in his basic characterization due to his simplistic loyalty painting a clear picture of his arc when he enters the picture max goal is to possibly get over past demons and survive without talking much now max getting over his demons isnt an issue since its what drives his character to be a better person than he was before however max being muted when furiosa is trying to kill him is idiotic hes man of few words but not very intelligentor is he the script cant decide on that as in one scene max manages to get a truck out a swampland that got mired in the desert by the use of the only conveniently found tree in that area so his reluctance to speak in a scene where women are trying to run away from the same lunatics chasing max and the leader is attempting to kill max a simple explanation would have avoided a well choreographed but rather pointless action scene    so earlier i made a rough outline of the film general story by making up an example that outline has serious issues first there is an explosion in a canyon with only one entrance way being shown that entrance gets blocked by rubble of rocks yet when the characters decide to return to where max was taken seemingly using the same road second were in the desert and making further suspend your belief is despite the large locations shown throughout the film max takes the same route to return to the citadel where the film basically starts lastly the antagonist took all of his men when chasing down max if not how come the citizens of the citadel didnt kill immortan joe the antagonist if his power was so limited it would explain the ending but if so even if the antagonist did strike fear in the peoples eyes the numbers of baddies still in the citadel is larger of that of what the immortan joe took with him when chasing down max and his five wives in context characters finally stop looking for answers in other places that might not exist but also in context it basically means the outline of the story is unbelievably goofy    if youre looking for action but mostly in the car chases variety mad max fury road has impressive stunt work for starter the way mad max fury road is filmed is done like an expert the camera in these car chases usually follows the cars without shaking the camera no matter how many cars are on screen together or if theres an explosion the camera doesnt need to shake to emulate the chaotic nature of just occurred in a scene it does it through visuals favoring long takes with wide shots angle to see every bit of carnage done in the film    another aspect of the car chases is the smart uses of wide shots throughout lengthy sequences a common problem for directors of higher budgeted action movies is that a director would make the mistakes of using many midshots instead to be closer to the action instead of pulling the camera further for a better flow one of the best example is a scene where max is attempting to break the window of a car from his capturer whos planning to kill himself in a blaze glory during a desert storm in the background max is seen struggling to hang onto a car and attempting to break the window while in the foreground his capturer is preparing to kill himself this paints a picture of struggle and a time limit within the same shot this also applies to car crashes as when a car gets destroyed the camera shows the entire car as it gets destroyed however instead of pausing to display this demolished car it will instead continue to follow the action one prime example of a george miller expert direction is in the film theres tanker that explodes and how he displays it incorporates many techniques from this lone scene in a couple of seconds miller combines cg shot composition and editing to seamless effect as max is fighting against a warboy on a poleladder thats very close to touching the ground in motion he successfully kills the warboy with the ladder now having less weight max attempts to get himself onto safety in the foreground on a moving car while the background a tanker is exploding within the same frame of shots this moment doesnt last any longer than seven seconds but seamlessly through expert uses of cg shot composition and editing its a seamless flow of coherence that miller often succeed in duplicating throughout the film    the stunt work is nothing short of amazing cars are demolished on screen alongside obtaining a high body count from in the film characters death in general the stunt will require a dozen or so cars as well participants to do insane set pieces not only do the stunt crew having perform a dangerous stunt on constantly moving vehicles but also do it with visibly little protection and sometimes with props like spears pipes baby bottle spray can and anything that can be found in this post apocalyptic film whats pulled off successfully is a string of convincing looking stunts that at some point in the film youll begin to believe every single stunt was done by actual person in some scenes a dummies is used but with an expert stunt crew it blurred the lines between a real person and dummy that its not even noticeable even among action aficionados    cgi is used in virtually every single shot of the film though its mostly use on either filtering colors or enhance the effect of a scene for instance going back to the tanker explosion if you removed the cg from that explosion youll still have the same explosion and stunt in place the only thing the cg is adding was enhancing the effect of an explosion to give it more visual finesse by darkening smokes and brightening up the flames sometimes cg will add an explosion or make a scene colors pop out fury road usage of cg is smart as it only uses it to add to a larger piece of the film instead of it taking over for an entire scene    set design is also detailed with a roughhewn general look for the clothings getting across a clear picture of this dystopia fascination with worshiping cars like a religion there is no normal looking car in the film as you have muscle cars on top of tanks vintage cars on top of oil rigs and things that look like killer porcupines with wheels underneath them theres a lot to admired from the vehicles including the manic arsonist guitarist surrounded by a wall of amplifiers the guitarist is also a key feature of the soundtrack with junkie xl using the chaotic music to stamp a mark of citizenship upon the particular tribes across the journey mixing in suspenseful looming soundbites to show the evernearing distance between threats    the acting i cant complain about but thats mostly because the cast provide a lot more conviction in their portrayals than the script does in providing details tom hardy hardly speaks in the film with most of his performance relegated to simply grunting and facial expressions despite the limitation in his performance tom hardy sells the image of a broken desperate man everything his character is feeling is received by the viewer properly charlize theron plays furiousa a cool looking character with a nononsense attitude playing a complex character whose composure hides a lot of her inner turmoil having to display a rough surface while at the same time a character whose holding onto what little hope for a better life there is left her chemistry with hardy is excellent displaying the changes in their relationship through the film going from strangers to enemies to partners convincingly    nicholas hoult plays nux a character heavy on a visual arc he has the most easily definable character traits utilizing them in his portrayal of nux a character that enthusiastically goes into blindly following a belief of the antagonist to a more down to earth person contemplating a new view for life his changes are among the most evident in the film benefiting from a character whose entire journey unlike the other two characters is seen to the finish line hugh keaysbyrne is a appropriate looking obviously evil bad guy type of antagonist his costume leaves little imagination for what kind of person he is consumed in the role byrne exudes desire hatred and vengeance through his portrayal of the film antagonist i also must give credit to the casting of largely unknown actor nathan jones and playing on his strength by giving him little words to speak and allot to express this movie was expertly put together needless to say    mad max fury road will make you mad and furious for the wrong reasons its more of an issue of the shallow writing that excuses itself to be a two hour chase scene gazing upon it youll be in awe at the large scale practical stunt work and gorgeous cinematography before realizing its product of its time that is only appreciated as such the biggest drawback to the film is it uncertainty to trust the audience its powerful images tell its story majestically but due to the spoon fed dialogue the reward that comes with figuring out what occurred in the story yourself diminishes the impact when it does it for two hours its technical achievement on all fronts but if the spoon fed dialogue was virtually removed than it would have also obtained a storytelling achievement to go along with its wild world
Sep 18 2015,positive,justs wow i expected a lot and received more adrenalin through 120 minutes without any break the visuals are just stunning i forgot to miss the plot being busy watching p
Sep 18 2015,negative,horrible purely horrible
Sep 17 2015,positive,good action boring story bad pacing good acting    a movie this well liked by almost everyone was sure to disappoint me and it did it wasnt bad but it wasnt amazing the acting was fine and the action was great it was the pacing that bothered me and the cg the story was shoehorned in and it took the backseat like it was supposed to so no real complaints there i never really cared for any of the characters or their plights the use of flashback to humanize max didnt do that at all and rarely made any sense it became cartoonish at points and the other characters were underdeveloped to care about their motivation or plight the acting was there and there wasnt a bad performance out of anyone    the graphics when not practical but cg looked terrible and extremely cg there is an establishing shot of the base in the beginning and it looks like a paper cutout diorama you made in middleschool it looked like a comic book since there was a thick outline around the people in the foreground it was weird most of the cg was bad there wasnt enough textures at times so it had that weird plastic look to it     the pacing was the worst offender in the film i get that its an epic car chase but there were scenes that took too long and didnt really feel like it fit or did anything to further the story theres this night scene which is clearly a blue filter over the lens of the camera its that bad that nothing seems to happen i get that theyre trying to strength the bond between the two leads but it felt out of place and annoyed me then the whole movie is about running away from the problem which is totally fine to go to this eden that takes a great chunk of the movie to get there but spoilers theres something wrong eden is dead so they have to go back to where they came so the first part of the movie takes 15hrs to get to eden and 30mins to go through now an army of cars and ruthless killers that werent there going out but on their tail to get back to the starting point eden should have been the middle point the blue scene should have been cut a lot shorter develop that relationship with action not exposition since nothing gets resolved there since they tell each other their history kind of which we the audience already know and more time should have been given to the fight to go back to the start there were more problems going to eden dont remember what it was called in the film then there was going through a fleet of murderous men and their vehicles that doesnt make sense     its a good film that would have been made better if miller kept it as a mindless action film and didnt try to make it just above that the storypacing and cg were the biggest retarding factors in this film with a very basic and somewhat cliche premise ironically max is the most useless and unnecessary character in the film to the point where i think he was a hinderance his character trope is so cliched its annoying guy with a troubled past that closes himself off to the world yet it affects him enough to retard progress in the real world he was overly melodramatic and it got annoying
Sep 17 2015,positive,cinematic masterpiece this movie comes as a breath of fresh air in 2015 george millers knocks it out of the park charlize theron stole the show as furiosa highly recommended
Sep 17 2015,positive,the best action movie ever made period tom hardy acquits well theron is amazing and it is absolutely non stop action its what i think of when i think of a mad max movie love the series but this is easily the best which is tough to say as it is being that the road warrior is so revolutionary on its own will never get tired of watching this not sure how they could top it
Sep 17 2015,negative,this is the worst movie i have ever seen there was absolutely nothing but car crashes and senseless action im talking action overload in a bad way im thinking does the director or anyone say ummmm hey guys this has no plot whatsoever maybe we shouldnt spend 100 million and ruin the legacy of a superbad movie bloodline the original mad max franchise was awesome this beyond sucks and a big kick in the  to all of you kool aide drinking movie lames that encouraged me to spend my hard earned money on this garbage this is 2 hours of my life i will never get back avoid at all cost not even redbox material save the 150 best regards marcel martin
Sep 17 2015,negative,mad max fury road proves that having only explosions and mindless killing wont make a film worth watching
Sep 17 2015,negative,campy and like a cartoon max in this movie has no substance huge budgets models and wild costumes contribute nothing the story is flat and goes in circles a waste
Sep 17 2015,positive,husband fell asleep watching this not his type of action film i couldnt quite look away even though yes it was one long car chase i hate it when a film relies too heavily on 3d effects and this one definitely did i also wish theyd put a little more effort into character development that being said i found furiouso heartbreaking and i want to be her for halloween now worth watching on dvd glad i didnt pay to see it at the theatre
Sep 17 2015,positive,the acting and storyline whilst interesting take a back seat to a two hour nonstop adrenalinefueled thrill ride
Sep 17 2015,positive,there is a lot going on in this film and if you look away for even a second you mind miss an important detail
Sep 16 2015,positive,absolutely amazing when i left that cinema i had witnessed cinematic history
Sep 16 2015,positive,if you like twisted metal the game  this is your movie way better than the first one  i regret not seeing this in the theater  best action film with car explosions and chase scenes i have ever scene in the every unique way possible  by far one of the most entertaining and best action film i have ever seen
Sep 16 2015,positive,balls to the wallas soon as it startsand doesnt let up till the end fury road will keep you clenching your seat through out its entirety very entertaining and exciting flick
Sep 16 2015,positive,two words fucking madness
Sep 16 2015,positive,could have sworn i reviewed this alreadyanyway it was bonkers and i adored it
Sep 16 2015,negative,ah yeah what happens when hollywood goes ape shit with an aussie classic throwing a butt load of money at the screen this this is what happens mad max fury road if you like car crashes explosions and more cgi than action plot or character development  this is the movie for you tom hardy as max sucks balls big ones hard charlize theron as furiosa spends the entire movie with a single facial expression   scowling up and to the left its a movie that spends 2 hours going no where  both literally and figuratively whereas daniel craig breathed new life into james bond bringing out a dark and sinister side  almost an antihero  to a film classic tom hardy neuters max and takes character development no where he says about three words does he have an inability to remember scripts or was the scriptwriter just lazy if they had put mel gibson back in the role he wouldnt even have had to act  just pay him in jack daniels throw him the keys and follow him around with a steady cam job done and twice as interesting without the cgi bullshit a bollocks of a film and crucification of a classic
Sep 16 2015,negative,this movie really was awful  yeah it had action but thats it  barely any dialogue and the little there was was mediocre ha mediocre zero character development  just a bunch of screwed up dudes driving screwed up vehicles with a couple of girls tossed in so the whole movie wasnt just screwed up dudes  another movie in what is sure to be a long line of crappy movies since hollywood can no longer make decent films
Sep 16 2015,positive,a glorious symphonic ballet of wanton destruction whose visual poetry dazzles and amazes whereas the current popular political correctness deems all life as precious this weekend jaunt through the local park with the baby in the stroller yells to differ reminding one of exactly what planet one dwells on standing ovation for george miller whose charming eloquence about the well hidden truth of modern society is jawdroppingly stunning the best apocalyptic vision seen for some time
Sep 16 2015,positive,weird weird movie but great action
Sep 16 2015,positive,one helluva ride  whoa  action like a raw one and the sheer rawness in all of everything  a carnage blockbuster

Sep 15 2015,positive,good movie would watch it again
Sep 15 2015,positive,fucking awesome and im not even watching it
Sep 15 2015,positive,someone hired this for me and accidentally got the dvd rather than bluray this was fitting because its just like a mindless 2 hour action scene from 10 years ago i thought we all agreed this concept sucks basically a cheesy death metal band chase an anonymous man and or woman possibly other women too from one side of the desert to the other people roll vehicles use rpgs hop inout of moving vehicles and eventually much to the audiences relief it all comes to an end at some point the ironic thing is this film probably has a higher rating than the originals and if you think there is going to be some of that magic apocalyptic ozploitation theme from its predecessors think again a solid action grind for people who enjoy that sort of thing not much else someone in hollywood should start selling movie kits complete with video game so you can regurgitate any old classic you want mediocre
Sep 15 2015,positive,an exhausting but fun thrill ride that starts at a furious pace and never lets up
Sep 15 2015,positive,a very very simple movie in essence perfectly executed  drive here drop these people off most movies that might carry a log line such as this would be a waste of your time not this one this is mad max fury road enough said dont wait any longer go watch it now

Sep 15 2015,negative,yes it has good visual  thrilling actions but this movie might have the most boring  dry plot of all 2015 movies
Sep 15 2015,positive,it is mad   and max is in it

Sep 15 2015,positive,best action movie in years who could have thought a movie about turning left instead of going straight will be so entertaining
Sep 15 2015,positive,chaotic thrilling wonderfully weird has some minor problems in the world of making total sense but whatever in most respects i could do without most action movies anymore but this ones action sequences are creative and bizarre enough to hold even my attention
Sep 14 2015,positive,visually stunning eyegasm best action movie ive seen in years hardy doesnt say much but he doesnt have to as this nonstop thrillride requires little in the way of commentary or banter
Sep 14 2015,positive,simply a great movie
Sep 14 2015,positive,just ok  action scenes were pretty good the story line was not  overrated

Sep 14 2015,positive,all action  that is it just all action
Sep 14 2015,negative,they all say this movie is a masterpice but i didnt like it at all it made no sense to me ugly post apocalyptic freaky guys charlize theron trying to be bad ass mad max barely speaking freaky guitar player that rides us to war like what i felt i was on acids or something while watching this movie
Sep 14 2015,neutral,story and acting was all on par for another mad max installment  however i found the use of cgi in lieu of actual explosions and landscapes to be very tiresome  i was unable to tell if there were actual stunts being performed or whether they were all fake
Sep 14 2015,negative,it only made a little sense at the end otherwise horrible waste of my time
Sep 14 2015,negative,the entire movie is just a chase scene and there is no character development at all i didnt care what happened to them because of that lack one of the worst movies i have ever seen
Sep 13 2015,negative,i would have rather spent the last 2 hours of my life cleaning my house thanks for nothing rotten tomatoes

Sep 13 2015,positive,great movie     a lot of actions and surprises on this movie
Sep 13 2015,positive,my personal favourite of the mad max films due to excellent performances from hardy and theron hopefully will get the recognition it deserves come awards season
Sep 13 2015,positive,excellent movie  has some of the best effects and fight scenes ever  lots of action suspense and drama  highly recommend  but very violent
Sep 13 2015,positive,visually spectacular especially given the little use of cgi saw on imax 3d a movie most certainly to be seen only on the big screen will have you at the edge of your seat for entire movie
Sep 13 2015,negative,this movie was just a perpetual train wreck it just starts in the middle of a story that has no real plot people drive off into nowhere for no real reason people drive all the way back because they finally say oh hey water would be a good thing the only high points of this whole snorefest is some mediocre action scenes and some hot women but the main douche character doesnt even bother to get a congratulatory kiss i struggled to just finish this movie hoping and holding out that there would be some sanctification brought from watching this film no
Sep 13 2015,negative,if felt like an endless video of slipknot the plot is very simple baddies chase goodies from point a to b then the plot gives way to experience it all over again from point b to point a 12 year olds are gonna love this movie yeah i would say this is a kidss film  kudos to the strong female action hero and the cool fighter grandmas
Sep 13 2015,positive,a rollercoaster of action and spectacular visuals
Sep 12 2015,positive,nonstop action stunning visuals and a meaty narrative make this more than just a summer flick clearly not for everyone but a masterful achievement no doubt
Sep 12 2015,neutral,too rushed not so much time for character development   not so great 3d effects on vudu  
Sep 12 2015,negative,this movie is horrible it has no storyline what so every you just join a guy that was hung upside down and losing blood next thing you kno the cars everywhere the end
Sep 12 2015,positive,everything i wanted out of this movie i received storyline is adequate if not mildly interesting but thats not what this is about its a slobberknocker and a damn fine one at that
Sep 12 2015,positive,i enjoyed this crazy action film quite a bit  i liked how almost all of the action scenes were really filmed and very few involved cgi  it took a little to get into the film as i have never seen any of the previous mad max films but for the most part it didnt have any effect on how much i liked this movie  i didnt see this film in theaters and i heard it was better in theaters and i believe it if i would have seen it in theaters i probably would have given it 4 stars instead of 35  it sounds like they were be making a sequel and if its true ill try to see that one in theaters
Sep 12 2015,neutral,has some good practical effects and action but its lack of plot and character development causes it to wear thin very quickly
Sep 12 2015,negative,the entire movie is literally based on a group of people driving around in a souped up semitrailer blowing stuff up you may enjoy this if you dont mind a two hour car chase in the desert but thats really all the movie has to offer
Sep 12 2015,negative,one of the worst movies i have ever seen i dont get all the great reviews
Sep 12 2015,positive,a future classic looks immense creative funny gory exciting and the quickest 2 hours i can remember cant recommend it enough pretty much constant action and plenty of tension but very solid performances and superb special effects
Sep 12 2015,neutral,mad max fury road was okay  not near the movie i was expecting and hoping to see hell there are no lines for the major actors the only actor who gets any sort of character development is nicholas hoult who plays war boy nux everyone else just fights everyone else im now glad i didnt see it in the theatre
Sep 12 2015,negative,lame very very lame
Sep 12 2015,negative,im a big fan of the original movies  im also a fan of the actors in this movie but i dont get the accolades for the movie  the dialogue was weak and mad max was almost a noncharacter in the movie  i really expected more
Sep 12 2015,negative,i would have fallen asleep if it wasnt so noisy im not smoking what you are
Sep 12 2015,negative,terrible  i had no idea what was going on most of the time  what a joke cant believe it received a 97 reviewer score pathetic
Sep 12 2015,positive,cracking movie astonishing to look at and totally unique like post apocalyptic wacky races loved it
Sep 12 2015,negative,not sure why rated so high story line was horrible just one long chase scene
Sep 12 2015,positive,its a nonstop action thrill ride through the wastelandput it solidly as the 3 best in this terrific seriesthe villains and story are just not in the same league as the first two but still a very good movie
Sep 12 2015,positive,thrilling whiteknuckle action that gleefully doesnt take itself 100 seriously  the backstorys oil wars leading to a world where battles are fought by large petrolguzzlers is about as ridiculous as actually having a war truck specifically for a postapocalypse metal guitarist and his six accompanying drummers just to provide a soundtrack but its all here and you cant help but accept it theron is formidable and furiosa is one of the best film action heroes this decade and its great to see hardy taking max back to the firstmaxfilm roots hoult is also brilliant and almost unrecognisable in a very good way great accent work by everyone as well
Sep 12 2015,neutral,21016 i really like the unique feel of this film  the way it is shot is very unique and the action sequences are fast paced the world that is created is also visually interesting with very nice special effects enhancing it even further  i really enjoyed the first hour or so but then the repetition started to set in  this is essentially just one big car chase scene  i havent seen any fast and furious movies but this is exactly what i would expect them to be  so while i really enjoyed many parts of the film i was ultimately a bit let down by the plot  it just feels like one big chase scene while it could have been so much more
Sep 12 2015,positive,this is a film daring in both ideas and imagery a spectacular carnival of carnage that puts most other blockbusters to shame im already gearing myself up for another ride
Sep 12 2015,negative,not a great movie hard to understand what they are yelling 90 of the time and the plot changes far too often making it impossible to actually get whats going on not tom hardys best work
Sep 12 2015,positive,fantastic film 2nd best film of the year
Sep 11 2015,negative,this is the worst movie ever  you must see it to believe it
Sep 11 2015,negative,welcome to monster truck i dont really understand the insane ratings this movie gets this movie is just a 2 hours long action sequence too much for me after 1 hour i was already tired to see explosions
Sep 11 2015,negative,awful  as a huge fan of the original i cant begin to describe how much i hated this movie the story line was pathetic the acting was egregious the effects were well done but truly no more than polish on a giant turd
Sep 11 2015,negative,wow did this suck i was embarrassed for charlize theron what a waste of her talent it was a big long car chase in the desert
Sep 11 2015,neutral,what a great big mess i almost stopped watching halfway through its less about max and more about the grrl power
Sep 11 2015,negative,this one is like an aquarium screensaver it looks cool but is not something you want to sit and watch for two hours
Sep 11 2015,positive,what a grand insane work of vision is mad max fury road what a bold and visionary exercise has george miller created  in a world of action movies that are mostly thin soup this is what you wish for from all of your action movies something created out of sheer ingenuity and imagination a movie that gets rolling and doesnt have time to stop a movie in which the bright and colorful visual palette is so audacious and so fully packed that your eyes cant catch everything that the director is trying to show you the first time around half the time you dont understand everything that youre looking at but you dont really mind its so big so grand so full that it demands to be seen in a theater i pity those who hold out for television    what surprises me is that all greatness happens in the midst of a modern practice that i normally despise the reboot yes george miller is rebooting the classic genre that he helped to create but hes not just slapping a coat of paint on an old fence hes embracing the new while taking us happily down an old familiar road    thirtysix years ago when miller first conceived of mad max he effectively wrote the book on how to make a movie about the apocalyptic future his was a world gone mad a savage and unholy world in which the bomb had tossed humanity back to its tribal state but only far enough back that it still had trucks and motorcycles to mow each other down with the participants dressed like professional wrestlers and shot each other at will when they werent driving spiked vehicles into one another ready to wage war for a tank of juice it was unique it was visionary and it was such a riotous journey that filmmakers have been chasing his vision ever since    in mad max fury road the mcguffin is a little more potent than just a race for gasoline the plot here is thin enough that it doesnt bungle the action but what it boils down to is the soul of humanity we meet max thomas hardy a haunted man suffering with painful bouts of ptsd  he has flashes of memories of people he failed to save before we can get a good look at max he is captured by the war boys a bald and skinbleached band of cultist working under the thumb of the tyrannical king immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne a fearsome being where wears plastic armor and a skull mask that is really unsettling  imagine if sweet tooth from twisted metal were a rock star and youve got the idea his cult is so vast and so audacious that his caravan travels the wastelands of australia with its own war drums and guitar solo no kidding theres a guy in this army whose function is to play guitar while strapped to truck specially designed for that purpose    what follows along a pattern of millers four mad max movies is that in each movie the world appears to be getting worse in the first mad max the world was devastated but still resembled one that we recognized in fury road the remnants of humanity have returned to their feral state still able to drive cars and have religious rites but closer in common sense to apes then to man    in the midst of this chaos one of joes warriors the onearmed furiosa charleze theron goes rogue and steals one of joes war rigs what the rig is carrying is more than just gasoline and weapons i wont spoil it except to say that mad max fury road isnt all boys with toys as the movie moves into its second half it really becomes a story of tough women fighting for their own survival    they exist amid a world in which every this is always moving george miller doesnt want you to catch your breath he allows you two or three slow beats but for most of its running time this is a movie that is always on the move essentially its a chase pictures but there are so many crazy images filling the screen at all times that you have to see it twice to catch them all even better is that fact that his action scenes make sense the chase scenes have an orientation so that we dont just feel that were watching a lot of nonsensical editing    his palette is refreshing in that its bright and colorful forcing you to realize how many movies these days are grim and dark and hard to see look at the trailers for dawn of justice and the fantastic four and youll see what i mean but mad max takes place mostly in broad daylight under blazing sun we see everything and there are bright colors definitive colors every vehicle every costume every location and every character has their own texture and their own look    what a crazy ride this is what a unique visionary is george miller he is a man who can create something as violent and bloodsoaked as mad max and then pull the reigns back for something as sweet and beatific as babe what he proves with mad max is that there are original worlds to be created in the movies it is still possible to make a great action picture that moves and pops and sings and excites us he had a plan and he executed it beautifully just like his trucks he kept his eye on the road and he didnt stop for anything
Sep 11 2015,positive,solid stay true to the original imo with a modern twist metal monster trucks explosions and metal
Sep 11 2015,negative,total garbage would not recommend to anyone
Sep 11 2015,positive,100 bad assery the guitar dude was awesome all he wanted to do was rock out while his homies did the dirty work
Sep 11 2015,positive,amazing film with the right amount of action and emotion its not your typical dystopian film based off of a cliche teenage novel a fresh take on a post apocalyptic world theorn and hardy worked so well together to create the perfect platonic bond there is no forced romance which is something that induces eye rolls when it is oddly placed in a film for effect definitely one of my top ten favorite films a definite winner
Sep 11 2015,positive,this movie is precisely what a mad max film ought to be and a worthy successor to the franchise you expect wild characters and outlandish vehicles in an explosive race across the desert and it delivers    whats even more impressive is the amount of back story and plot that is laid out at the start just by showing the way the people live its a barbaric survivalfocused existence but it tells everything you need to know    dramatic visuals and intricately created vehicles lend a rich background to the movie and charlize therons prosthetic is perfectly executed great work here its brutal and violent and dirty and covered in grease and sweat theres fire and drums and fights on top of speeding trucks if thats what youre looking for you will not be disappointed
Sep 11 2015,negative,artsy and boooooooring
Sep 11 2015,negative,omg one of the worst movies ive ever sat through  no plot  no character relationship   not even a tie to the old mad max movies  terrible  just terrible  dont watch it  pathetic attempt at entertainment
Sep 11 2015,positive,was expecting much better from the word of mouth movie seemed to be about getting nowhere as fast as you can then doing it again
Sep 11 2015,positive,what a spectacle from the first frame to the last the movie is relentless in providing outworldly surprises gruesome yet gorgeous gory and still glorious warriors on fast bikes that are grannies war armies led by a rock guitarist acrobats on bending long poles as the ultimate weapon in the fast car chase mystifying and mythical as contrasting in every scene as in the main story where maddeningly macho max is second fiddle in all the bravado to the far better furiosa
Sep 11 2015,positive,the best movie of the summer nonstop actiongreat practical effects and outstanding performance by charlize theron hard to believe its been made by 70 years old director
Sep 10 2015,positive,good movie but not as memorable as the original but george miller is smart and is getting positive publicity by getting a wellknown feminist to give her stamp of approval of course shared with the world so everyone knows anyway i appreciate the practical effects but the little bit of cgi that was used was very jarring because they were pretty poorly done and stuck out like a sore thumb from the practical effects they did that and the fact that it was basically just a car chase movie are the only complaints about it otherwise good movie charlize theron definitely outshined the character the movie was named after
Sep 10 2015,positive,great movie cant say anything bad about it
Sep 10 2015,positive,a must see for any mad max fan
Sep 10 2015,positive,ah the lure of unchecked violence and explosions left with my ears bleeding a bit but the story was good acting was great and the overall  weve doomed ourselves feel was there
Sep 10 2015,positive,expecting the old mad max that make this movie not too good its not what i expected  it seems like somethings missing
Sep 10 2015,positive,i really enjoyed this movie a fun crazy weird wild ride just as i had hoped i think the character mad max could have used a few moments where he does the extremely cool  wow maneuver seems like everyone has more of those moments than him   i liked that the womenwives that were being rescued werent just damsels in distress but that they got down and dirty and helped really cool movie
Sep 10 2015,positive,cars in the desert boring  lets add some crazy people guns explosions deep characters memorable villians and the best vehical action sequences with incredible lifelike visual effects    count me in
Sep 10 2015,positive,awesome characters simple plot intense undying action perfection has a name and its fury road
Sep 10 2015,positive,i dont get all the hype
Sep 10 2015,positive,a proper action movie that can best be described as the best chase scene but 2 hours long
Sep 9 2015,positive,spectacular this may be one of the best scifi action adventure films ive seen in some time it has a great cast amazing production design and makeup effects and a great story line thats very well directed by george miller even if you havent seen the other mad max films you can follow along with this one just fine its great high energy high octane entertainment
Sep 9 2015,positive,most better than i expected
Sep 9 2015,positive,a surprisingly great story telling and terrific production action sequence  one of the best films of this year
Sep 9 2015,positive,why cant i add another star in there 6 out of 5
Sep 9 2015,positive,one of the best action movies ive seen
Sep 9 2015,positive,i didnt expect to love the movie this much i liked the original mad max trilogy but this may be even better masterfully actionpacked and exceptionally weird and cool well acted and a fun ride rating 910
Sep 9 2015,neutral,nothing special about it
Sep 9 2015,positive,man i dont want to just add to the hyperbolic hype machine but jeez this movie is satisfying  we all knew it was gonna be good with miller back but who knew itd be this good of a continuation
Sep 9 2015,positive,i believe this film resurrects the shownottell mantra to filming that has been lost of use for nearly a decade
Sep 9 2015,positive,the most metal movie ever
Sep 8 2015,negative,two hours of ridiculous violence explosions and driving followed by more violence more explosions andmore driving in a post apocalyptic dystopian future cut out of a comic book devoid of plot and character development and lets not forget the punk rock band driving along with the bad guys playing nonstop electric guitar was the original this bad ugggg can i give negative stars
Sep 8 2015,negative,ok first of all what was this film i didnt understand where the story was headed or where it was it felt so sloppy throughout and was boring yes there was great action but what was the purpose nothing it was a 2 hour crapfest of a whole bunch of michael bay bs the storyline was horrible and made no sense this movie was an absolute boring and stupid movie i dont understand what was so special about this film in the acting department charlie theron stole the show it was her movie why was tom hardy there it should have been called mad charlize race for random crap seriously what were these people going after water or fuel and 90 of these people need oxygen tanks to breathe then there was this one moron im telling you he was wearing red pajamas and looked like a mummy that was wrapped 2 days ago overall to its roots mad max fury road was a comedy i laughed during this movie and people laughed during the transporter refueled really this might be one of the greenest smelliest and most horrific load of crap ive seen all year
Sep 8 2015,positive,tom hardy and charlize theron at theyre best
Sep 8 2015,negative,action  yes visuals  sure scenario  not so much  i struggled to watch this in its entirety the first 30 minutes set the tone perfectly  do not expect any coherence depth of characters or well anything other than full inyouface action here nothing stands up to scrutiny no character holds up to any real logic and of course it has nothing to do with the first movies of the same franchise  let it be noted that charlize theron is the real main character here and plays her part with talent and charisma which sorely lack in tom hardy
Sep 8 2015,negative,is there any way for the reviewers of this movie to rewatch it and then review it again  im guessing after a second viewing they will see how bad this movie is  the dialogue is the worst ive ever witnessed in a major production  the story  sorry there is no story  and when will the studios realize tom hardy has no charisma  would have preferred to have charlize therons character be max instead  maybe changer her name to maxine  then towards the end when he thinks therons character might not make it hardy finally says max my name is max  who cares at that point  wow i still cant believe how bad this movie was and how its getting such positive reviews
Sep 8 2015,negative,worse than the water world
Sep 8 2015,neutral,the car scenes were great would like to put a stopwatch to the time that max is actually on the screen felt as if this should have been called something else besides mad max not one i would want to see more than one time
Sep 8 2015,positive,a very entertaining edge of your seat thrill ride of a movie in this one its not max who is the hero but the character played by charlize theron i missed it at the theaters my loss but the dvd arrived last week from amazon and i watched it over labor day a very well done movie
Sep 7 2015,positive,very entertaining  nonstop action that keeps you on the edge of your seat
Sep 7 2015,positive,saw it in theatre a few weeks ago when i heard that another mad max film was being made prior to seeing any trailers or previews i was disgusted at the concept that there was no way that current day hollywood level production companies could possibly produce anything but garbage regarding this film i was wrong dead wrong this film is a fantastic experience that deserves to live as long and well remembered as any of the films before it do in my opinion nicholas hoult played a real character i was glad to see him come out of his pretty boy shell in my opinion i hope to see more from himnow that i have seen this film lol honestly i loved upwards of 90 of this film there were a few not so well paced scenes but other than that it was a well polished beautifully shot and masterfully created piece by my reckoning
Sep 7 2015,positive,dazzling special effects and packed with action an edge of your seat thrill ride of a movie good acting when there is the opportunity mostly its an exciting visual ride of a movie
Sep 7 2015,positive,just to say it ive never been a big mad max fan i enjoy the movies for what they are but im not a cult fan i did really get a kick out the action sequences in this film definitely a fun seriously actionpacked movie
Sep 7 2015,positive,action from start to finish 2 thumbs up
Sep 7 2015,negative,finally managed to watch this  and wasted two hours of my life with a lameass and completely predictable truck chase through the desert i cant remember the last time i was so bored by a movie 
Sep 7 2015,positive,jaw dropping astonishing movie one of the best ive ever seen
Sep 7 2015,positive,one of the best mad max movies ever
Sep 7 2015,positive,the only 5 star movie of the year so far according to me i have seen this movie too many times to admit and am looking forward to watching it again with someone who hasnt experienced it     the visual effects were amazing the performances were really outstanding it had the right blend of practical effects and cgi and most of all it made me love a movie about one big left turn    the story was as straightforward as that of gravity but its the storytelling and the performances that took it a step further for me the first 20 minutes set the tone perfectly allowing people to realize that there are creepy people involved in this bizarre ecosystem and they seem to be running the show    charlize theron is brilliant as furiosa and despite having matt hardys characters name in the title owns the movie matt hardy performed like a true filmmakers actor and thankfully didnt become overzealous to make this movie just about himself he barely has any lines and relies on his superb and sometimes subtle acting chops i keep on forgetting that these are alist actors and not these characters everytime i watch this movie they are that good in it     finally george miller not only proves that hes not invalid because of his age but instead he showcases how valid he is because of his age by making this years greatest movie aces all around now bring us a sequel 
Sep 7 2015,neutral,this movie was disjointed and bizarre great action sequences but this was not memorable     the guitar player did make me laugh
Sep 7 2015,positive,classic george miller directing with a solid story and well sussed out characters but it really should have been called furiosa fury road
Sep 7 2015,positive,high octane funyeeehaaw
Sep 7 2015,positive,an artistic and stylized action movie  perhaps it is more appropriate to say that this a violent lovepoem dedicated to the entire actionfilm genre  this movie had seriously awesome cinematography and seriously awesome action choreography  the story was simple but yet enjoyable  tom hardy played his brooding macho character with a lot of subtly  charlize theron on the other hand played her unforgettable character with bold heroic strength and beauty  this movie may not be for everyone but it was definitely good
Sep 7 2015,positive,very action packedwould see this movie again i did think that theron took the show and hardy played a very wimpy road warrior mel gibson was much better
Sep 7 2015,positive,visually impressive with a fairly involving story for the genre
Sep 7 2015,negative,pathetic mindnumbing dullness there is something to be said for less is more this is what you get when you have more money than inspired creativity a whole lot of bluster for bugger all glad i didnt pay full price
Sep 7 2015,negative,this movie was terrible  you have to develop the story not just explode one vehicle after another
Sep 7 2015,negative,thought this was awful
Sep 7 2015,positive,hold onto your seat because this one is nonstop action  not for the squeamish
Sep 7 2015,negative,nice visuals i developed zero connection with the characters i didnt care about them or even know why they did the things they did if you dont care about character development and only care about action sequences this is the movie for you
Sep 7 2015,positive,this is not a movie its an experience
Sep 7 2015,positive,gets better with each viewing amazing treat for the eyes
Sep 7 2015,positive,if all you want is nearly nonstop action then this is the film for you however the plot is so thin and the characterization so shamelessly stereotypical that it failed to make too big an impact on me
Sep 7 2015,negative,great effects terrible movie limited character development 2hr car chase where you dont care or get emotionally involved overated
Sep 7 2015,negative,this movie was horrible
Sep 6 2015,positive,this was a movie that literally kept me on the edge of my seat and i could not have asked for more i wanted to know what all the fuss was about with this movie and i must say it truly did lead up to the hype tom hardy is spectacular as ever and charlize theron brings to life a character i never would have thought shed portray so well hugh keaysbyrne portrays a great antagonist and the supporting cast of nicholas hoult as nux and the other girls definitely bring a spark into the film overall 1010 
Sep 6 2015,negative,2 hours of chasing action scenes great imaginery stunt work and scenography but bothers the fact of seeing two long hours of chasing a apparently vulnerabale truck and trying to stop it
Sep 6 2015,positive,shouldnt work yet succeeds briliantly
Sep 6 2015,positive,this movie brought back to life the story line of mad max  my wife and i were thrilled when we watched it in our house on bluray they need to make more new mad max movies and keep it going for the fans
Sep 6 2015,neutral,really disappointed in this movie the plot just jumps around and the entirety of the movie is just one big chase scene tom hardys dialogue for the entire film could fit on an index card charlize therons character isnt developed at all and then youre supposed to care about her the ending left me asking why
Sep 6 2015,positive,september 5th 2015  october 18th 2015
Sep 6 2015,negative,this movie was so overrated watched this with a friend with the sound on the first time and i literally fell asleep a few days later i had it running with the sound off and it looked cool when i was paying attention to it but there didnt seem to be any point to this film ill give it an a for grade a garbage
Sep 6 2015,neutral,if you like 2 hours of explosions and chase scenes then this is the movie for you the movie didnt really have a story and there was barely any dialogue
Sep 6 2015,positive,this is the most well crafted action movie i have ever seen even if the title character doesnt talk alot or is in the movie alot thats almost exactly like the originals on top of having the best car chases and practical action scenes in the past decade it is also a fantastically shot film the cinematography is beautiful the acting is great for the lack of dialog the body language and facial expressions feel genuine this is the perfect adrenaline rush if you havent already buy the bluray
Sep 6 2015,positive,awesome just like i knew it would be
Sep 6 2015,negative,silly no plot teenage noise movie your life would have to revolve around violent video games to find this waste of time interesting
Sep 6 2015,positive,got to have a wonderful movie night with my fiance and my family  we decided to watch the 4th installment of this great franchise  glad to say that no one came out dissapointed  action packed from beginning to end non stop from one scene to another we didnt have time to blink when something else was already going down it was so worth it dare i say that this one was up to par or better than road warrior yes folks i mean that
Sep 6 2015,negative,watched most of the movie but it really didnt make much sense to me
Sep 6 2015,negative,this has to be the worst movie i have ever seen in my life this movie is a disgrace to cinema there is no plot or storyline charlize theron and tom hardy are great actors but this movie did not showcase their real genuine talent i do not understand how the director was able to release this film in theatre as a movie lover i will not watch this movie ever again word of advice do yourself  a favor do not ever watch this movie this movie is a waste of time and money your welcome
Sep 6 2015,positive,amazing action that immediately puts you on the edge of your seat or has you leaning back so you can make sure your seeing everything going on if you havent seen the original series or you never consider yourself a fan i would still give this movie a shot and maybe youll change your mind
Sep 6 2015,positive,loved itgreat entertainment
Sep 6 2015,negative,worse then thunderdome everyone especially the writing should have been better let down
Sep 6 2015,positive,dont get mad with me to the max but i was not enthralled at all with mad maxfury road george millers redux of his classic 80s mad max franchise was mostly about visual storytelling but there was no true connection with any of the characters mostly the madman himself max if you are not familiar with this franchise the film takes place in a dystopian future where eccentric characters set the pave to a divided society tom hardy stars as max who is about to be killed in some type of mundane chain to a speeding truck kind of deal when circumstances change he now joins a group of female rebels led by imperator furiosa profoundly played by charlize theron but not to the caliber of oscar nominated dont get furioso with me just my take tom hardy who is one of my favorite actors turns out his worst performance of his career he looked lost and stale throughout the picture however i am still in the tom tom club as a hardy fan hardy har har nicholas hoult was sound as the desperate nux director george millers direction was way over the top and not much could be said of his limited screenplay hey but i did not hate it all together john seales brilliant cinematography got my seal of approval mad max fury road was a road for me that will be less traveled    average
Sep 6 2015,positive,that moive is good but there where some parts that made my angry that docent mean the moive bad even i still watch for the good action
Sep 5 2015,negative,violently overrated boring as hell nihilistic claptrap big budget lads on crazy vehicles in the desert cliches galore plus oo charlize t being badass shame she didnt have a script to be badass in craptastic waste of money in my opinion ive hear better stories out of two ten year olds in a sleepover
Sep 5 2015,positive,i can see why some might consider this movie a little overrated especially since character development story and max himself are little short in the movie but this may be one of the best action movies in past decade there are so many crazy scenes that i will definitely be watching this movie many many times a definite classic
Sep 5 2015,negative,started well slowed down came to a halt and then the movie literally went backwards and became a snoozefest
Sep 5 2015,positive,awesome fun entertaining a keeper
Sep 5 2015,neutral,critics rate this pile of dung far too high
Sep 5 2015,negative,watching as an on demand rental and it simply is not worth the price even there  no real plot no real acting  just a whole lot of things going boom exploding catching on fire getting shot or stab  i suppose from a cinematographically point of view and special effects it could garner some oscars but i was basically bored out of my mind and quit half way and then came back to finish as an obligation but still bored
Sep 5 2015,negative,awful  does not even hold a candle to the original
Sep 5 2015,negative,wanted to love this movie i loved the old series the first two more than the third but honestly i just dont see what people like about this movie i found it to be rather boring the plot to me kind of sucked it just seems like the movies critics or people on this site seem to like i normally hate and the ones that do bad on here may not be great but arent as bad as people make them out to be this wasnt a horrible movie but i gave it what i gave it because the expectations were high and this was just barely worth the rental
Sep 5 2015,positive,really intense and entertaining loved it
Sep 5 2015,positive,truely amazing effects and just simply entertaining
Sep 5 2015,positive,best action sci fi ive seen in a long time  thrill ride from start to finish  great new ideas  good story  only critique id give is max was not the center of this story at all  charlene was
Sep 5 2015,positive,have not seen star wars yet but so far this is the best movie of the year  i never thought i would ever say anything remotely close to that when it was in reference to a mad max movie  
Sep 5 2015,positive,awesome film and thoroughly recommend
Sep 5 2015,positive,it had a lot of action in it but i wish it was more of mad max
Sep 5 2015,positive,fun imaginative movie but i felt kind of bored near the end like i stopped caring a little bit about the endless car chases and who would kill whom i didnt really like either of the main characters they both had no personality and as many people have already pointed out  plot and storytelling takes a backseat to action i need to see it again but for now i feel like the movie is overrated
Sep 5 2015,positive,an immersively perfect action film
Sep 4 2015,positive,always being interested in the credibility and complexity of a plot but mad max road fury made everyone see that simple is sometimes made to be amazing though some of the subplots seem to be strained they never lacked integrity and purity from the delivery of the actors this was definitely hoults best performance and introduced him into the world of far more serious and complex characters the epic music combined with the unbelievable imagery pursued feverishly by the ravenous plot made me wish to stay and live in those moments eternally and for life an excitement that could only be ensured in a far fetched reality with truly human truly heroic characters
Sep 4 2015,positive,i always wondered about lone critics who disagreed with the general consensus  did they not see the same movie the rest of us did  and yet for mad max fury road i find myself going against the grain  this was a good movie but certainly not a great one  the road warrior was a great movie  at the risk of sounding heretic the first half of mad max beyond thunderdome might have been even better    what those movies had that fury road does not were two welcome qualities in an action movie which are attitude and restraint      in regard to restraint this movie was almost nonstop action  that sounds good on paper but it tends to diminish the impact of action scenes as they pile up throughout the film one after another  its a bit like indiana jones riding off on a horse and stealing a truck from the nazis  its one of the best action scenes ever filmed but part of why its so great is because its not 2 hours long      during parts of this film i felt like i was watching a cirque de soleil performance  it was too much too often      and though the movie had character development it lacked attitude  as an example from beyond thunderdome theres a scene where gibsons max has to relinquish his weapons  as he pulls more and more of them out from every nook and cranny the collector of weapons has a look on his face that says ive seen it all and even i know this is one bad man  its an incredible scene that sets the tone for what max has evolved into since the road warrior  and it didnt take 5000 extras to film or require a massive explosion  thats what i mean by attitude      in fury road tom hardys max never has a single moment of even that magnitude much less a thunderdomeesque scene where all eyes are on him  instead we get that for charlize therons character  and while that might please some who are looking for more female heroines i didnt pay to see tomb raider  i paid to see mad max      in the road warrior the villains knew who max was by the end though not by name  and the people he saved  they knew him as well hence the haunting monologue at the end  but in fury road it seems the only one who knew him by the end and was truly impacted by his presence along the way was furiosa  which brings up a natural question if the grand majority of the characters in the movie dont know or care who max is by the end then why should the audience
Sep 4 2015,positive,fking love tom hardy charlize theron is so bad ass 
Sep 4 2015,positive,pretty good action flick  charlize theron was awesome and so was tom hardy  it will never hold the same place in my heart as the originals but it was a valiant effort
Sep 4 2015,negative,watched this movie on dish i did not go to see it in the theater because i was afraid of being disappointed  my disappointment was just delayed remake turned mad max into pussy max and the whole thing came across as a victim mentality  i dont think the filmmaker was in touch with the nerve the original fury road touched and its a shame if he would have got it it could be the new cult movie instead its just a starship troopers 2 with no redeeming qualities other than the cute harem of gals
Sep 4 2015,positive,the wildest weirdest most inventive thrill ride ever this movie is a cinematic gem of excitement and special effects
Sep 4 2015,negative,this was quite possibly the worse movie ever made people actually got up and left during them movie i stayed only hoping that it would get better it sucked it was horrible if you watch it and you have half a brain you will soon realize that you just wasted 2 hours of your life if you watch it and you liked it well there isnt much to expect from you
Sep 4 2015,positive,unbalanced overlooked
Sep 4 2015,negative,road to nowhere      this movie was absolutely deplorable sure no sex or swearing but it paled in comparison to the original road warrior and mad max where was the dog and gyro man when you really needed them    the acting if you can call it acting was limited to 10 word utterances hardy was godawful with his aussie type accent if you can call it that  in fact the accent changed towards the end of the flick  the only redeeming features where charlize theron and some of the action sequences     but while it was loaded with action so much of the film was speeded up to supposedly heighten the action which it did not  the plot was so thin as well      all in all a total waste of time of true mad max fans
Sep 4 2015,negative,even worse than the original no character development couldnt care less about the characters couldnt understand the dialog for 20 min of the movie how this can be called fresh is beyond me its just another noisy shoot em up
Sep 4 2015,positive,this movie was a surprisea very welcome surprisei never thought i would like an action movie that muchcause i never felt like an action movie made any sense at the endbut this was fantasticthis was a really amazing moviei enjoyed every scenei enjoyed every sequence and i was blown away by the way action and meaning can be combined in a very thoughtprovoking waya movie about hopeand a movie that is hope to a cinema that produces films for visual pleasure and no passion at allcharlize theron blew me awayshe did a fantastic job bringing to life the surviving and more heroic side of womenand of course tom hardywas physically there without even having to talk that much and this is saying a loti really do start to respect him a lot as an actorim so glad i decided to watch this movie
Sep 4 2015,positive,was confusing at first then amazing near the end
Sep 4 2015,positive,this is one of the best movies of 2015 amazing action tom hardy is amazing as mad max miller is a legend
Sep 4 2015,positive,one of best movies that ive seen in a long time  deserves an academy award
Sep 4 2015,negative,no where as good as the first
Sep 4 2015,positive,one of the best action packed thrillers ive seen in a long time despite the lack of description and intermittent plot holes the story was anything but cliche and the characters were out of this world they constructed a surreal post apocalyptic future such that the societal structure and the tribal interactions seemed completely plausible which made the lore of the story that much easier to embrace ill watch this again and again
Sep 4 2015,positive,stunning magnificent crazy violently epic an adrenaline infused bullet to the head tour de force masterpiece
Sep 3 2015,negative,wow what a waste of time for a 97 rated moviemakes me question rotten tomatoes  george miller can make a pretty looking film but this has zero characters with any iota of draw
Sep 3 2015,positive,two hour chase scene dont watch it for the story watch it for the action
Sep 3 2015,negative,sooooooo disappointing no character development or story line full of special effects and machinery but not much else
Sep 3 2015,positive,incredible movie has by far some of the most intense and fun action scenes ive seen in a while its well shot well written and is filled with non stop action in a good way of course but it spends the right enough of time to get to know that characters
Sep 3 2015,positive,film and imagination at its finest its a fun ride one you can watch again and again
Sep 3 2015,positive,this reboot is a very well done film the beautifulugly apocalyptic world is still looking great max doesnt do so much in this film like talking but his badass sidekick furiosa seems to get the spotlight in the film not saying that max sucked but he doesnt do as much as mel gibsons version   the villain with the bane mask is cool hilarious how tom hardy gets to wear his bane mask in this film  the plot is that the characters try to get home and get out of that prison place   the stunts and action is so awesome to watch  overall you will really enjoy this movie
Sep 3 2015,positive,this movie is beautiful
Sep 3 2015,positive,visually mad max fury road is amazing but i really dont see what all the hype was about
Sep 3 2015,negative,why i didnt care for the fury road    im sure most of us have seen mad max fury road the movie critics gave it great reviews rotten tomatoes and imdb all show it having approximately a 98 approval rating and now the international film festivals all giving it awards and high accolades  these are all opinions and everyone is entitled to their opinions there was just something missing when i watched this reintroduction of one of my childhood heroes that despondent loner who was first on the search for vengeance for his life that was torn apart and then as a he wanders the dessert in a post apocalyptic australia he finds himself an unlikely hero to people more desperate than himself he always manages to win the fight against overwhelming odds  when watching the former mad max trilogy i always felt a sense of isolation and desperation i felt i emotionally connected and could empathize with how lonely his world could be his family and friends gone food gasoline and water are so scarce they are priceless and coveted by all  much of what had built that emotional connection for me in those movies were the cinematography the sound trackaudio work and the pacing it wasnt a rip roaring adventure chase scene throughout it slowed at times and built a sense of suspense and offered time to know and understand key characters    in my opinion i felt at the opening of fury road we should have received a more thorough reintroduction to max those of us who know him already have not seen him in 30 years certainly some have rewatched the films others may have no clue who he is also he has lived for a period of time wandering the post apocalyptic wasteland on his own since the last film show me how this has affected him in the opening of fury road we get a brief voice over monologue as introduction and we see max forced to eat a lizard as a means of sustenance then he is almost immediately captured by bandits from the citadel  even a brief montage of max searching for something fuel food civilization show him on the outskirts of the citadel contemplating if it is a safe place or hostile give me a camera shot of a small section of road sand blowing over it as a hint of the world that use to be but is now forever lost max shaking an empty canteen thirsting for water shaking empty gas cans these small things could easily build an emotional connection to max and make me feel a need to root for him as i then have a better sense of what it would be like in this desperate situation   then we find ourselves at the citadel lots of dirty skinny people here it must be a crappy place to live but better than wandering the dessert alone i really dont know how bad these peoples lives may be but they get really excited when that rare and coveted resource called water is released  wait is water not such a rare resource or are these people just idiots because when the water is released they catch about 1 cups worth in their random pots and pans then splash around in what is left on the ground is this a utopia of plenty filled with a population of morons  then their leader imperator joe the one who controls the water tells them to not become addicted to the water everyone needs water its not an addiction its a necessity joe just bad dialogue  joe is a god like figure to this community we later find out because he controls the water and it is pumped up from the ground and only he can command it to be released so obviously this clan is beholden to him also there is plenty of water he is just holding back to maintain his hold on the community  he does have a very ominous mask and costume so i honestly like him as a bad guy figure regardless of some of the less than stirring dialogue he is given  then we meet furious she gets to drive the truck why i dont know apparently she has proved herself in this male dominated militaristic society i appreciate woman in a strong leadership roles but this society clearly doesnt seem to be heavily dominated by women i would have appreciated furiosas character had i some idea of how she managed to become so entrusted that she gets to drive the truck that hauls their most precious resources fuel water and breast milk thats right the citadel is a lady milk dairy farm it doesnt specifically say that but it is conveyed through brief shots of women in a milking room just a brief glimpse into her past flashbacks something throughout the movie to show me what she overcame could really help elevate her character and make you cheer for her again its all about creating an emotional empathy for a character for me  so away she goes with her small contingent of security vehicles on her way to the bullet farm and gas town i guess to trade milk for supplies road trip  we are driving we are driving whoa wait what she went the wrong waywhy dont know joes crew is watching uh oh shes gone rogue why uh oh joe is mad apparently furiosa stole his lady friends or prized breeders as joe calls them you know pet names and all so cute  joe sends out the call to chase down furiosa and get his ladies back rally the war boys  now we meet nux who i really didnt like in the beginning but now i will say he is the only character in the movie that was dynamic enough to make me care about him nux as a war boy has one purpose in life and that is to do as joe commands and if he does an honorable job and pleases joe he will enter the gates of valhalla which i can only assume is some form of heaven as the movie progresses nux goes from only wanting to please joe to realizing he can do good for others and in doing so he would be more significant in this life than he ever was when he was just a war boy out to please joe  additional characters that i believe could have used better development are the breeders and the mothers or old ladies im not sure what they were real called because by the time we meet them i was just wishing the movie would end  the breeders are taken to safety by furiosa or they were kidnapped by her because she thought they were abused and didnt want to be with joe im not sure if the breeders wanted to leave or furiosa convinced them they should leave because once they are being pursued by joe they seem to want to return to him a simple scene showing how these women suffered under joes captivity would have made me care much more about these women not that i want to see abuse or cruelty to women but an indication that they had suffered would build an emotional connection that you then want to help save them as well  the breeders are the central component of the movie we should be made to care if they escape  the old women seriously they just loosely tied a few things together like hey there is no green place turn around and go home honestly they could have driven there met no one and formulated a plan to go back  now the guitar guy  i enjoyed the concept of the guitar guy jamming out as the war party moved along but i wanted him to actually play the music that you hear instead he plays a bar and then there is a score that takes over and includes none of his guitar work i wanted him to be james hatfield from metallica melting my face with fuel for firemakes sense they need fuel guitar guy is shooting fire also guitar guy is shooting fire but not using it to fight anyone super wasteful  here in a post apocalyptic world where fuel is scares and this idiot is just burning it up  i dont feel a sense of scarce resource or desperation the breeders are wasting water when they get one of their miraculous escapes from a horde of fast moving vehicles all the vehicles are supercharged gas guzzlers nux empties about 10 gallons of gas into his car in an attempt to kill himself and blow up the war wagon really if i was in charge and someone wasted that much gas there would be no valhalla for them  i just didnt get the same desperate these are hard times sense from this movie i wanted to feel suspense the whole time you just knew these guys were going to make it and furiosa and max would live but you knew nux was going to be dead before the movie was over of course they had their close calls but never did you think oh man this is the end for them  it was a great bit of cirque du sole style chase scenes pieced together again and again but i really could have done with 45 min less chase scene and 45 min more character development  on top of all of this im a car guy and there were a number of ridiculous vehicle related items that were wrong or nearly impossible  climbing around touching hot exhaust pipes an 18 wheeler can escape motorcycles and supercharged cars nux drives with a flat tire at high speed max would have to stay in place for this to be somewhat possible but still incredibly unlikely spitting a fuel mixture into the supercharger and getting boost climbing around in an engine compartment fixing the engine while driving down the road and its not just a single engine its a dual engine setup this rig would lose so much power after losing 50 of its power it would be crawling along not out running all those other vehicles    yes yes its just a movie dont nitpick the silly details but really character development could have tied it all together in a lovely package for me    okay enough of the why i didnt like it honestly i just wanted more of an emotional connection to the characters  positives  there were lots of explosions  it was well shot  the action scenes were well choreographed  joes costume was uniqueish post apocalyptic darth vader  probreast feeding
Sep 3 2015,positive,simply put breathtaking
Sep 3 2015,positive,having not really seen previous mad max films i wasnt really aware of the back story good scenery makeup and relatively unknown cast little dialogue but the storyline was really gripping enough to keep me interested
Sep 3 2015,positive,best movie every watch this movie
Sep 3 2015,negative,i was looking forward to this i bought the blu ray too i will make this short i almost had a seizure from all the computer generated scenes flashing at me from one second to the next there was no feel for the characters no story unrealistic apocalypse charlize looks like a dude the end
Sep 3 2015,positive,something i learned the hard way if you watch this movie without any prior knowledge about the franchise youre going to be a little lost much to my surprise however the movie was so visually brilliant that i didnt even care its a stunning spectacle with a terrific score  id recommend it to anyone
Sep 2 2015,positive,simply cant get over how much fun this movie is shot and directed to perfection with breathtaking action and a killer score mad max defies almost all tropes of modern hollywood blockbusters the film is incredibly smooth and provides the rare opportunity to just sink in and forget about everything around you which seems to be lacking from many other films    one thing i noticed and really appreciated is how colorful the movie is instead of a dark tone miller chose to color the movie with nothing but bright and vibrant shades even the nighttime scenes are a very vibrant blue    its quite mindboggling to think that miller a 70year old man creating this masterclass nonstop action thrill ride the first twenty minutes are filled with more energy and passion than about any film thats come out this year the only movie in recent memory that id say rivals this one in sheer intensity is whiplash
Sep 2 2015,neutral,i dont usually give into reviews when it comes to my interest for movies but when a movie gets a 98 on rotten tomatoes i have to see it now im incredibly flustered and trying to figure out how to get my 5 back itunes rental ive watched the mad max series before but when you do a reboot sequel you need at least some kind of introduction to the series the movie depended on the mystery of each characters past and future but failed to fulfill the suspense im disappointed in the reviews here the action was great but the storyline sucked
Sep 2 2015,positive,not a bad movie a lot of action that you would expect worth a look when you want to watch some blood and guts
Sep 2 2015,positive,such a crazy intense  thrill ride of a movie  superb acting and an interesting plot line weird yet riveting at the same time
Sep 2 2015,negative,there is no movie just cars blowing up and people shooting at each other for two hours     you dont even get a little bit happy when the good guys will a battle so ridiculously bad the character building is     this is simply not a movie and i have no idea why anyone would rate this with even 3 stars     please dont wast your time
Sep 2 2015,positive,incredible movie   it has everything we feminist love a worthwhile story with a strong female lead about time  as an extra bonus it comes with superb action compelling characters great plot twist and a fulfilling resolution the visuals are also stunning and the world of mad max is brought to life highly recommended movie 
Sep 2 2015,negative,i thought it was the worst movie ive ever seen in my life    horrible    37610
Sep 2 2015,positive,even though there was a bunch of explosions this movie was amazing
Sep 2 2015,positive,strangely entertaining
Sep 2 2015,positive,omg that movie kick ass i love it
Sep 2 2015,positive,the world of fist of the north star hokuto no ken
Sep 2 2015,positive,good movie not as awesome as everybody says it is though nice scenes of action and ok special effects
Sep 2 2015,positive,a synonym to the mel gibson version done in the 80s if youve seen the latter then this isnt for you otherwise a great thrill
Sep 2 2015,negative,2 hrs of michael bayesk explosions fin curtains
Sep 2 2015,negative,the critics loved this movie terrible  just one long car chase in a desert glad i didnt pay to it in the theatre
Sep 2 2015,positive,mad max fury road without a doubt is the summers best film not only is its action incredible but it also has one of the best villains of the year immortan joe this movie definitely deserves 5 stars
Sep 2 2015,positive,this is one of the best movies i have seen so far in 2015 charlize theron and tom hardy are forces of nature and this movie is a testament to their towering talents it is an awesome thing to behold
Sep 2 2015,positive,mad max is a sequel one could suppose to the three films of the mel gibson era although it is more of a reinvention of the mad max world or perhaps reimagining is a better word to this end miller brings a creative hand that is sheer spectacle on a grand scale a little digging reveals that this film was reportedly made over a period of 14 years initially constructed as a single chase sequence although the final product provides some ingenious ways of narrowing our focus in on the characters through colourful imagery and attention to the small details the thrill of the chase is very much intact     as with the mad max motif the setting is a post apocalyptic world where resources are slim max the man of little words finds himself enslaved in a majestic desert enclave where along with the rest of the slaves finds himself at the feet of a merciless leader who has been hoarding an underground water source for his own purposes the films plot which is refreshingly simple against this backdrop moves forward when as a character suggests at one point the people start to push back this push back comes in the person of furiousa theron who creates a plan to free the wives who have been taken by the merciless leader for their ability to repopulate the new earth with perfect human offspring here the world of furiousa and max intersect     there is much to be said about the details themselves it feels like every aspect has been meticulously handled with not just intentional oversight but intimate and personal motivation the cars themselves become each become a character and you almost feel a hint of sadness when they meet their demise they are a fusion of time periods and eras an effort to sentimentalize a time that is long past perhaps some of the vehicles emerge with some familiarity the spiked menaces and the long fuel truck while others elicit some surprises in ingenuity the acrobatic sequences with the long extending poles come to mind     the colour red is used for striking contrast in the desert setting symbolizing the fine line between life and death illuminating an epic sand storm as well the colours merge with the characters themselves the white attire of the retreating women also providing a striking contrast with the underlying emotion and subtle sexual tensions that arise which are wonderfully and tastefully explored with a degree of subtle modesty colouring the movement of the film itself      at the heart of the film is the question of hope which comes as both an idea and a character the question that looms is one that max assumes at one point in the film suggesting that one needs to be careful about the idea of hope for when hope fails your world fails with it the idea of hope also becomes a question of the chase and the journey a question of choices and direction the films concluding sequences which i wont reveal here becomes an intriguing commentary on these ideas taking the layers off of the question of what happens when hope fails     the character of nux hoult is perhaps the most intriguing especially in a discussion of the films heart and soul as we move from the spectacle to the chase and from the chase to the person nux a man who knows only one form of life blood and war gets swept into this journey of hope his transformation reaches outwards to the nomadic purposes of max whose sole purpose is to survive and to the community minded mission of furiousa nux becomes a picture of the possibilities that hope can provide in such an immersive and merciless apocalyptic setting life is about more than living and dying he becomes an embodiment of redemption of new life even for as crippled and hopeless as his body and circumstance appear to be set against such an epic back drop which includes a massive vehicle to transport a blazing electric guitar and a riser of drums this idea becomes somewhat monumental     mad max is a reinvention that brings the series to a whole other level it is spectacle and it is commentary it is post apocalyptic and it is wonderfully retro it moves with fury but it demands attention to detail it is what a summer film should be
Sep 2 2015,negative,oh how this movie speaks to my inner child of thinking that the grass is greener on the other side then only when getting there realising its not and going back home againmeh
Sep 2 2015,positive,this movie is really awesome and a big surprise
Sep 2 2015,positive,entertaining but overrated    set in a postapocalyptic future an evil ruler immortal joe keeps his subjects under tight rule  then one of his most trusted lieutenants imperator furiosa sets out to escape his regime taking with her all his wives  along the way she meets max rockatansky    directed by george miller who directed the original mel gibsonstarring mad max in 1979 plus both its sequels mad max fury road is two hours of nonstop action  the plot is rather basic and theres very little substance to it but the action is frenetic and constant      however while this makes it entertaining it does feel monotonous after a while  theres only so far you can go with an all style no substance approach    ultimately reasonably interesting but vastly overrated
Sep 2 2015,positive,films incredible nonstop action the only thing that i was disappointed in was they had promised the black and white version that had just sound playing that would be included in the film turned out to be that they are releasing the film with that one attached to it later on this is just another way for warner brothers to make more money i cant blame them the film was incredible and the sound score is really awesome really well done especially if you have a surround system at home the sound score is so well done that im even debating about buying find the soundtrack which never really catches my attention but its mixed by junkie xl
Sep 1 2015,positive,this  is an awesome film original  and radical  not showing charlize theron as a diva but rather a warrior it has intense and bloody scenes  and crude scenarios that immerse you into the movie and keep you entertained from start to finish
Sep 1 2015,negative,this movie was garbage did not compare or even come close to it very sad
Sep 1 2015,positive,it is quite a good film although not much happens in it its basically one long car chase sequence bit overated and not sure why its even called mad max when chalize theron is the main character of the story and max is simply along for the ride so many aussies cast in this film too that an american accent sounds a bit out of place
Sep 1 2015,positive,the best movie of 2015 until now and the best moie of the mad max franchise
Sep 1 2015,positive,quite possibly one of the most mind blowing movies of all time whose sheer scale and masterful filmography is a thing to behold
Sep 1 2015,positive,t2 set the standard for the action movie genre character depth strong storyline and remarkable action and special effects  the baton has now been passed to fury road which has emphatically maintained the standard set over twenty years ago
Sep 1 2015,positive,a visually stunning post apocalyptic extravaganza of awesomeness
Sep 1 2015,positive,everything the original three wished to be no offense intended mel
Sep 1 2015,positive,this film didnt have the impact of the original
Sep 1 2015,positive,exhilarating nonstop action supported by an interesting wellselected cast and wonderfully creative production design make this the summer blockbuster of 2015
Sep 1 2015,positive,thrilling adventure wasnt sure what to expect when i heard about this reboot and waited awhile after it was in theaters to see it so surprised and pleased
Sep 1 2015,positive,this film is lost its own little world i love this fucking movie  we waited 30 damn years for this sequel god it was worth it these films arent big on story or character development but i think its more the idea of the series you have to get lost in these films like the other characters are youll understand why they have do the things they do in this terrible postapocalyptic world and have a good time while youre at it    that being said mad max fury road is just as absurd bizarre unique and well mad tom hardy gives a funny and great performance as max hes a great addition to the series and a good replacement for mel gibsonwho had a quick cameo charlize theron is also cool but i think nicholas hoult was far more interesting he absolutely disappeared under the white makeup and surprised me of how much effort he was putting into this performance i love seeing george miller expand on his universe and really show us just how screwy the future could be if society truly would fall apart the bigger budget makes this movie look and sound amazing and somehow it still contains the same feel as the first two mad max filmsbeyond thunderdome kinda got bland    i look forward to future installments continue expanding this world george miller take all my money
Sep 1 2015,positive,easily one of the best action movies released in the last decade     i have shamefully not watched the original trilogy maybe when i was younger but cant remember     i have high hopes for the series with hardy signing on for 4 more movies
Sep 1 2015,positive,as a fan of the previous mad max movies i went in excited and afraid soon enough it proved to be just what we always wanted it to be a good simple  story with excellent over the top action crazy visuals and a man playing a guitar on top of a truck never in my life have i been so satisfied with a sequel
Sep 1 2015,positive,approached a skeptic became a fan
Sep 1 2015,positive,i liked it   pretty cool
Sep 1 2015,positive,great movie good action they do toss in a little socialist political symbolism in the end i didnt likebut great overall
Aug 31 2015,positive,one of my all time favorite movies best movie of the summer hands down would recommend to everyone
Aug 31 2015,positive,storyline was eh good scenes though
Aug 31 2015,negative,one long boring car chase with no real plot stereotypic female roles and lousy acting
Aug 31 2015,negative,found it to be quite long and boringthe original was much better
Aug 31 2015,positive,wast not as good as i hoped
Aug 31 2015,positive,if you havent heard of of george miller i beg you to please watch the mad max saga i appreciate this because it doesnt rely on cgi for effects and soundtrack is amazing the cinematography is beautiful in contrast to the bleakness of other action films and each shots were carefully planned this movie made wasteland beautiful i like the muted down performance of tom hardy as max and allowed charlize theron as imperator furiosa to shine she was an interesting character to study
Aug 31 2015,positive,hands down an excellent movie a masterpiece perfect in every way
Aug 31 2015,negative,the most disgusting and awful movie i have ever seen cant understand the high ratings
Aug 31 2015,negative,a drive in the desert and back and that is literally itawful
Aug 31 2015,positive,an adrenaline filled thrill ride that is almost guaranteed to wow even the most passive moviegoer fury road is filled with interesting characters strong performances beautiful visuals and arguably some the greatest action in cinema history the overall plot is pretty simple its basically an escort mission that you would find in a video game where you have to go from point a to point b now on paper that doesnt sound too interesting but the way the film tells its story through the combined use of impressive visuals interesting characters and strong nonverbal acting actually give this movie a level of complexity that many movies today lack
Aug 31 2015,negative,absolutely horrendous movie no story line haphazard action  loads of cgi work i dont know how people actually managed to sit through the whole movie
Aug 30 2015,positive,pretty awesome having seen the previous editions i was actually wondering what it would be like without mel gibson but dang it blew me away charlize theron was hot too intense action and great special effects
Aug 30 2015,positive,so good breathtaking and in depth distopian fiction 2015 must watch
Aug 30 2015,positive,must watch mission impossible 5 to decide but for now its the best 2015 movie 
Aug 30 2015,positive,its impossible for mad max to ever fall in love againhe is forever the wandering mercenary
Aug 30 2015,positive,incredible visuals vehicles and sets create a surreal world throughout the movie whats even better is that it was largely practical effects a reboot done right
Aug 30 2015,positive,holy sht is all i can say
Aug 30 2015,positive,nux  if i die im going to die historic on the fury road    wildcrazy and unrelentingthe holygrail of kickass scifi movies in recent times  watch it asap and youll fall in love with this kickass movie
Aug 30 2015,positive,i loved it action packed fun
Aug 30 2015,positive,loved thats amazing
Aug 30 2015,positive,charlize theron and tom hardy are excellent in this very original remake one of the bets films ive seen this year
Aug 30 2015,positive,wow what a movie mad max fury road is the story of mad max tom hardy as he follows charlize theron as she and a few fellow women try to outrun patriarchal tyranny in the guise of the white darth vader aptly named justjoe although mad max is the titular character the main protagonist is furiosa with a story that is all the same a feminist movie in the setting of masculine testosterone driven balls to the wall beginning to end action frame for frame george miller returns to make the fourth entrance in the film series that made him famous over 30 years ago its also funny that as a grandpa who has made such family films as babe and happy feet shows modern day action filmmakers how its done he uses more practical effects and cgi sparingly to give us a fully realized encompassing story filled with so much action that will leave you in awe if youre not captivated and dont buy into this movie you either dont like action movies which is understandable or youre just numb from overindulgence of action and a good old fashioned action film cant satiate youre lust for all things destructive i recommend that this film be watched by everyone everywhere at any time even though its a general four out of five i must give the film a 44 out of 5
Aug 30 2015,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed the first hour and then it just felt a bit same samey   very entertaining though
Aug 29 2015,positive,although i heard arguments that this was a misandrist movie i respectfully disagree    the movie was mad and simply great however i do wish that joe was given a bit more attention
Aug 29 2015,positive,awesome movie incredible in the theater the action the sound the music you dont watch this movie you experience it
Aug 29 2015,positive,must admit that thanks to the original mad max yes people this is a remakea new way to put it on cinema but is the same thing from the 70s anyway i admit once more that thanks to this story classic video games like twisted metal  borderlands came to existence n other words got born yeah borderlands has more storydialogue if you think of it over mad max mad is more action than dialoguesomething i dont like very much on movies since i love more to think than to sleep honestly this movie works coz its visually stunning and if you have played those games you will love it even more or if you grew up watching the originalnostalgia must be the correct choice so yes i recommend this film only for those reasons the music score is not that bad neither the make up but editing has its flaws to much speed on scenes that could work with the correct slowneutral touch enjoy  august 29 2015 review kinda late
Aug 29 2015,positive,it is amazing how a film can be gripping even when the story is not known we do not know where they ve come from we do not know where they are going all i know is i cannot stop watching     it is a 2 hour long big awesome car chase filled with bombs catapults bullets and lets not forget that crazy guy with the guitar    if you compare it with the mel gibson mad max you will find a major difference it is in english we can actually understand what words they are saying that does not make the sentences any more of nonsense but still a major improvement
Aug 28 2015,positive,i never saw the old mad max films but this one was awesome
Aug 28 2015,positive,non stop action non stop thrill
Aug 28 2015,positive,compelling ambitious and outstanding
Aug 28 2015,positive,would have been a fantastic movie if i didnt spend most of it asking myself what the heck is happening
Aug 28 2015,positive,as it stands right now fury road is the best movie of 2015 and the best action film in at least 15 years its equal parts lawrence of arabia and terminator 2 it succeeds on every level and you havent seen anything quite like it
Aug 28 2015,positive,was good to watch mad max again as an adult loved the older ones when i was younger
Aug 27 2015,positive,weird movie but very refreshing
Aug 27 2015,positive,very good movie but more about charleze than tom hardy he hardly speaks through the entire movie but quotes few gruntsthe vehicles were very cool and crazy looking as well as the traveling bandguitarist
Aug 27 2015,negative,full of stunning visual effects and well choreographed action scenes and nothing more
Aug 27 2015,positive,full intense thrilling
Aug 26 2015,positive,action packed from start to finish fury road may be my favorite movie of 2015
Aug 26 2015,positive,madness chaos non stop action  good times a worthy watch albeit nutso
Aug 26 2015,positive,super fun and for being a movie about the cars costumes effects which are all super awesome the story is actually good
Aug 26 2015,positive,the nonstop made it feel as though i was holding my breath the entire time
Aug 26 2015,positive,this was a fun action packed crazy movie to watch i enjoyed the 2 hours watching this
Aug 26 2015,positive,a movie with some of the greatest action shots ever witnessed
Aug 26 2015,positive,what a movie  what a lovely movie d
Aug 26 2015,negative,why do people want to pretend that this movie is more than what it is fucking terrible waste of time for a crappy story line with a bunch of explosions and loud music
Aug 26 2015,positive,lots of action and very fun
Aug 25 2015,positive,pure fun action and ridiculousness  everything i hoped it would be and executed to the highest degree the visuals and the set pieces which are pretty much the whole movie are breathtaking im not sure i always understood the politics of this postapocalyptic world but ultimately it did not matter what a wild ride     grade a
Aug 25 2015,positive,the awesome weirdness of this world and great use of practical effects make this one a definite watch at the cinemas immortan joe and his strange children make for unique villains in a movie thats plot pretty much boils down to an extended car chase due to someone taking something from the bad guy the main criticism from myself and the mates i went to see it with was that it does become a little repetitive as the movie goes on
Aug 25 2015,positive,this is not a remake its a new version  so enjoy it for what it is  they did a good job of capturing the original vision    well worth watching if your a mad max fan
Aug 25 2015,positive,after a surprise premier at this years cannes film festival mad max fury road is poised to melt audiences faces off this weekend  supposedly picking up things where the 1985 film mad max beyond thunderdome left off george millers new installment in the franchise sees the titular character this time played by tom hardy facing off against more carnage blood guns cars and chaos max has just pissed off a local warlordcult leader named immortan joe and he is out for revenge his escape through the australian outback sees him cross paths with furiosa a dangerous and unpredictable rogue leader with her own agenda the two form a makeshift team of sorts and the pair must to to rely on each other in order to outwit immortan joes ever growing pursuit    essentially this all boils down to one hell of a chase movie filled to the brim with hypermasculinized batshit crazy antics miller directs the action sequences flawlessly with a kinetic constantlymoving energy which adds a mesmerizing layer of visceral appeal to the whole thing fury road is pure spectacle and looks great  even in 3d where objects fly in and out of the frame without feeling too gimmicky or distracting the level and precision of detail that went into this film is almost as crazy as the stunts various tattoos weapons clothing vehicles makeup etc are all incredibly wellcrafted and give the film a unique feel of time and place oscar nom for best production design anyone    despite the films desire to be constantly churning on a violent machismo overdrive fury road feels perplexingly feminist at times charlize therons portrayal of furiosa easily makes her the coolest character in the film and her determination to be both wickedly badass but still sensitive when needed overshadows hardys quiet and onedimensional performance as max and then there is a scene where an allwomen militia take out a human trafficking gang girl power for the win    fury road like many other films of its genre suffers a bit from lack of characterization dialogue and undervalued performances the most we ever hear from max is during the opening voiceover where he sprawls on giving the necessary exposition to explain that this is a postapocalyptic film where survival is valued and ethics and law are not i wish we could have seen more of an explanation for his backstory or more interactions with him and furiosa  just something more to show that max is indeed a person and not some lifeless prop    despite its few setbacks fury road keeps the narrative tight and compelling which compliments the unstoppable fluidity of the action its a rich and immersive film sure to impress those who can stomach its brutality and a rare treat to see something so adrenalinepacked without compromising on story    leaving me feeling like a child at the amusement park fury road no doubt sets the bar high for what a summer action flick can and should aspire to
Aug 25 2015,positive,this film would have been perfect if it had been about half as long the storyline was singular so after the first hour i found myself wondering is it over yet
Aug 25 2015,positive,this movie is perfect it has so much more than tons of fantastic action there are actual character arcs no shaky cam practical stunts and effects the only people who say this movie is short on plot are the same people who have problems paying attention in movies or perhaps they are used to amateurish backstorydialogdumps that have unfortunately become the norm characters only say things to each other that actually make sense not like in christopher nolan movies where they bizarrely tell each other things they already know for the benefit of the viewer which they must know is there because otherwise there is no reason for them to be saying what they are saying you need to get absorbed in the movie and pay fucking attention you stupid twats all the plot is there all the exquisite detail of the world is there just get absorbed in the movie and look at it from the point of view of a person dropped in the world there are enough dialog cues to tell you everything you need to know but apparently everyone wants their dialog the same way mac from sunny wants it i cant even comprehend anyone not liking this movie it is perfect
Aug 25 2015,positive,much of the movie was set in the desert land so not very pleasing or interesting to watch the scenery the characters and interactions themselves made up for the lack of scenery though the story line was easy to follow but not easily predict a good movie overall
Aug 25 2015,positive,best action movie of the year
Aug 25 2015,negative,i saw this movie charlize theron is a wonderful actress she does a great job in this movie but i still do not understand why people like this movie i love weird and strange but this movie is strangely weird i wasnt impressed
Aug 25 2015,positive,i dont know what the hype was aboutit wasnt that goodwe barely see max the movie should be named furiosa
Aug 25 2015,positive,never saw the original  but fury road was non stop action from the opening scene till the end  not much depth behind max or any of the characters though  and max barely even spoke the whole time
Aug 24 2015,positive,visually stunning but having never seen the original mad max movies i was lost for a while trying to get a hold of the storyline great to see charlize the tough chick as the hero
Aug 24 2015,positive,characters that will transcend in film history a strong cast great direction editing a fantastic score and a hearth with just the necessary mad elements to make this movie simply one of the best action films since the past decade
Aug 24 2015,positive,mad max fury road is an achievement in action thrillers that is truly wonderful the use of practical effects and cgi are extremely well done and have much more substance than practically all the films that have came out in the last decade but when all is said and done is the action pointless are the characters big dumb and stupid well simply put no everything in here has been crafted to near perfection and george miller has truly achieved a masterpiece in film making
Aug 24 2015,negative,the fact that this movie is rated as high as it is makes me want to vomit
Aug 24 2015,positive, wad disappointed with the film bearing in mind all the hype that was around it at the time of release    the action in the film was by far my favourite element with each action scene feeling innovative and completely fresh    didnt feel there was enough of a story being told to tie together the intense action scenes
Aug 24 2015,negative,i really dont know what is going on with rotten tomatoes or the critics this movie was horrible
Aug 24 2015,positive,the quintessence of postapocalyptia
Aug 24 2015,positive,possibly the best action movie ive ever seen
Aug 23 2015,positive,tom hardy steps aside in what is clearly charlize therons momentum and boy does she deliver there is a reason for all the hype indeed fury road is a nonstop roller coaster ride which consists of 3 major action scenes scattered in 2 relentless hours of film however i dont believe this movie deserves all the hype its been getting its ending feels rushed and so does immortan joes demise it seems as random as any of the thousands of thugs  or warboys if you may   deaths we witness during the film i believe this movie should be remembered for what it clearly serves brilliantly orchestrated action sequences together with the strong memorable character that is imperator furiosa
Aug 23 2015,positive,best movie i have seen in the past 5 years
Aug 23 2015,positive,theres nothing to hate everything was awesome
Aug 23 2015,positive,great googley moogley what a spectacle solid acting drives the action sequences which are highkey and fastcut multilayered so all can enjoy if you need dramatic backstory its there  you just have to dig for it and not expect to get spoon fed you just want to see cars go boom thats there too if you like both of those aspects you will be shiny and chrome all the way to valhalla     brilliant direction drives the stunning imagery i can see how its similar to the road warrior but it feels less so in the end but comparing to the original is oddly enough an applestooranges comparison     hardy plays it great but theron steals the show strong yet human and real and tougher than you she delivers through and through her portrait of furiosa is nothing short of epic and its her subplot that drives most of the movie even the redemption of the warboy outshines max using max as the pallet to mix the other stories is a brilliant bit of film making     there was no need to make this a mad max movie and i suspect it was a device miller needed to get the studios on board they just could have made a new movie titled after the main character which isnt max     its superfantastic best film of the year for me
Aug 23 2015,positive,almost a silent movie the story is told with a minimalist mindset and characters saying only what needs to be said  the action is unparalleled and deserves to be seen on the big screen
Aug 23 2015,negative,maybe i am getting too old for this stuff but if i watch this and all its silliness and try to compare it to any other movie it just comes off as absurd and awful im almost at the point of thinking that the 98 ranking on here is some type of joke being played by internet trolls the movie has a difficult plot line at best and is basically a two hour chase scene full of ridiculousness
Aug 23 2015,positive,mad mex return to form in this overall rate and awesome one of the top films of 2015 and once again shows that george miller is an awesome director and look forward to see what more comes from mad max and also tom hardy is a very good new mad max
Aug 23 2015,positive,great action meaningful metaphors
Aug 23 2015,positive,i never saw the originals so i didnt have a bloody clue what was going on for about the first 40 minutes  but by that point i was gripped one of the strangest films ive seen in a while but the effects and style were pretty cool worth a watch ¼
Aug 23 2015,positive,given all the hype i really thought this would be better but it was just watching a slightly more interesting fast and the furious movie oh well
Aug 23 2015,neutral,where was the backstory
Aug 23 2015,positive,this film is awesome this is some of the most exhilarating action to ever be put on film furiosa will go down with sara connor and ripley as one of the best movie heroines ever great effects cinematography costume design actingi could keep this up forever george miller did an amazing job making an amazing film action films now have a new standard thanks to mad max fury road
Aug 23 2015,positive,so good i watched twice
Aug 23 2015,positive,a fun entertaining movie tom hardy was great as was charlize theron and im usually not the biggest fan of hers the only thing i didnt like is the wives werent the best actresses but other than that little nitpick the movie was awesome
Aug 22 2015,positive,it was so sad in the beginning but most of it was the best
Aug 22 2015,negative,are people just extremely delusional about this movie yes the road carnage was wonderful to watch but thats all there was no compelling story minimalist dialogue in other words this movie is a visual experience only and yet it rates to the top 15 of all time i loved the first two mad max movies the third was soso
Aug 22 2015,negative,95 bizarre vehicle chases crashes and mutilations  5 scantly clad women  almost zero plot  bring your earplugs  i gave it the extra star for impressive cgi
Aug 22 2015,positive,the best action movie i have ever seen recommend this movie to everyone
Aug 22 2015,neutral,dont let the cover fool you therons the driver not hardy
Aug 22 2015,negative,this film is shit terrible dialogue and pointless script
Aug 22 2015,positive,pure adrenaline action id watch it again
Aug 22 2015,positive,didnt really follow any previous movie plot line however was a great movie over all 910
Aug 22 2015,positive,original action with apocalyptic art
Aug 22 2015,positive,mad max fury road is quite impressive i would go so far as to call it close to a miracle     i almost never see rather than review movies in this genre as its not my thing but i was pleasantly surprised to find that mad max was pretty good and it paid homage to its gibsonesque prequels the film works on almost every level as a comic book movie as an action flick as a character study and much more also it has beautiful cinematography and performances to burn some of the cgi was almost as good as in the 2009 movie avatar i dare to say it was a really well done movie overall that will satisfy almost any viewer and i highly recommend the experience
Aug 22 2015,positive,it was sweet if you like mad max go see this
Aug 22 2015,positive,mad max fury gives us a stunning and at the same time blizzard dystopia world along with some crazy action we have some cool war rigsvehicles while the movie is an entertainer its weak on the story and characterization tom hardy is no mel gibson the charisma is missing
Aug 22 2015,negative,eh michael bayesk explosions good cinematography no plot what so ever this is really a two hour uturn in the desert didnt explain anything hardy was good i guess max character doesnt take much acting skill though terribly bored by the end of the movie too many questions from plot holes by the end al well
Aug 22 2015,positive,the freakiness elevates the film
Aug 22 2015,negative,the 2 stars was for the action but where the heck was the story im shocked that people have rated this so high i thought it was awful and really disappointing i almost want to rate it one star
Aug 22 2015,negative,extremely disappointing installment non of the actors made me believe in them i saw them make the journey and i was viewing from a far if i want to connect to maxs story i am better of dusting off the first three it is however visual entertainment and for that it is great fun for a movie night but not a worthy successor i do not understand that the titular character is playing second fiddle to ms therons character i almost feels that mad max was added to justify the mad max elements post apocalyptic landscape tribal societies and outrageous vehicle and to boost box office sales the script seems to be written not to tell maxs story hes just along for the ride the one moment max had an opportunity to take central stage and which might have made it a mad max film was cut on the editing floor i assume it was the nightly action where max returns with blood on his face and the viewer does not even get a glimpse of what our boy did just charlizes words it is not his blood
Aug 22 2015,positive,this film gets us on lsd and ecstasy together the real experience of this movie one can get only in theaters and who got the chance to cant help the feeling what the fcharlize even without one hand is more beautiful then brides and tomhardyuuuu tom hardy is real mad max he is so real that i cant even remember mel gibson in this role everything is so weird but so connected in one violent disturbing image of postapocalyptic world that we cannot stop the feeling and wonder what if really one tiny hand of beans could make our day in the future i certainly did great movie for action lovers
Aug 22 2015,positive,a bold vision fully realized in its stark color palates dramatic soundtrack and absurdist costume and prop design  action sequences can be a bit confused at times and the plot is very straightforward but you cant argue this film doesnt deliver what it promises
Aug 21 2015,positive,it is what it is  it delivers too
Aug 21 2015,positive,absolutely  best action move of the year
Aug 21 2015,neutral,100 rehash all action but still boring
Aug 21 2015,positive,in my opinion its the best mad max movie ever
Aug 21 2015,negative,i wanted to like it but it this film was just appalling in fact it was utter drivel  98 of the rotten tomatoes critics were obviously under the influence if they liked this film  i applaud the other 2  in fact id say this film was exactly the same as the 1995 flop waterworld except this time they switched from the sea to the desert  waterworld was actually a far better film compared to this tripe  anybody who fancies the film i can sum it up in one line nutters drive from one place kill each other along the way and do the same when they drive back  virtually no dialogue no character developmentnothing  crap
Aug 21 2015,positive,for the first time in as long as i can remember this is a film that actually lives up to its trailer basically go watch the trailer if that looks like a good time then go watch the movie its rarely that easy but honestly fury road is such a masterpiece of quintessential action filmmaking that there really isnt much else to say director george miller has reinvigorated the mad max mythos with an unexpected surge of gorgeously photographed action set pieces that put every other big budget superheroaction film this summer to shame even more surprising than watching a 70 year old george miller hand hollywoods action filmmaking elite their own asses is that charlize therons imperator furiosa is the star of the film theron has created a badass for the ages and the decision to have her character drive the narrative is brilliant this film is a triumph of high energy action filmmaking and deserves to be seen repeatedly on the largest screen humanly possible
Aug 21 2015,positive,mad gorgeous and beautifully shot this film better get the oscar nominations it deserves a unique blend of amazing action and heartfelt stroytelling
Aug 21 2015,positive,the movie is good but not great  simply the movie has one of the most exciting chasing senses i have ever seen  the graphics and effect are adorable   the performance of charlize thorn was incredible  but  the story is very very weak and ridiculous    there are no new places or characters at all   i mean the same places and people you begin with are the same in the end   so i gave it 7 out of 10
Aug 21 2015,positive,this movie is 5 stars all the way
Aug 21 2015,neutral,whats this thing called story  basically it was just a glorified actionbased music video its fun to watch just for action if you dont mind the lack of good storyline
Aug 20 2015,positive,well crafted and aesthetically stunning
Aug 20 2015,positive,its an ok movie not sure why it has a 98  maybe nostalgia factor took over there its a bit odd the entire movie is kind of an extended chase scene
Aug 20 2015,positive,beyond  it s all i can say 
Aug 20 2015,positive,i really enjoyed this far more than i imagined  as i am not always keen on remakes but this is superb the action an filming is stunning and beautiful despite the storyline and the only reason i did not give it 5 stars was because of the cut and shut job  pardon the parody of the ending it was too short jumped from scene to scene making no real sense  and lacked the conviction of the rest of the film a real shame but definitely worth a watch
Aug 20 2015,positive,very good  interesting but there was no story set up so if you havent seen the previous mad max movies you probably wont understand what is going on
Aug 20 2015,negative,waste of time  if you are a true mad max fan this movie is not for you mad max has nothing going on in this movie other than bowing down to feminism  in the end he doesnt get his car and good dog back
Aug 20 2015,positive,bone chilling music adrenaline rush heavy action and a simple plot makes the 4th entry in the series the best of all
Aug 20 2015,positive,fury road brings george millers postapocalyptic franchise roaring vigorously back to life
Aug 20 2015,positive,the action movie of 2015 nonstop nail biting heart racing brain melting eye blinding lung collapsing bowel voiding hair whitening teeth shattering madness  if you couldnt tell from my description i quite enjoyed this film
Aug 19 2015,positive,get ready to replace your eyeballs after this experience as max rockatansky is back in his most explosive sensory overloading vehicular led journey yet fury road a petrolheads sand infused dream come to beautiful yet utterly bonkers existence in george millers long gestating action extravaganza that not only laughs in the face of modern blockbusters but blows them away by creating some of the most outstanding carnage ever captured for our screens     in a modern day and age where its hard for action events to differentiate themselves from each other blockbusters that are cgi laden and shaky cam heavy fury road does the impossible and turns what is essentially a 2 hour long desert set car chase into something that is unique and refreshingly mad with a budget in the hundreds of millions and a crew that clearly knew how to deliver the goods 70 year old director miller has had his visions come to roaring fruition from the cars the inhabitants and the milk productions this is the apocalyptic wasteland that miller must of envisioned all the way back with the original mad max but only know did technology met the requirements     its without question that what elevates fury road to the next level of pure cinematic enjoyment is the fact that the world we enter into for these 2 adrenaline fuelled hours is a world that feels like a living breathing entity a handcrafted and often destructively beautiful labour of love there will be a constant reminder to oneself that what you are seeing is largely perfectly constructed stunts and props played out to painstakingly elaborate setups every clash of metal on metal every loud burst of exhaustive vehicle power and every swaying stunt man is a sight to behold and thanks to a thankfully strong cast of leads and supports millers orchestrated chaos is not lost by the wayside    it was never going to be an easy task for the actor stepping into mel gibsons leather boots but man of the moment tom hardy does a solid if slightly unmemorable job in his new gig in what is a role that sees max play wingman to charlize therons feisty and soon to be iconic imperator furiosa its a criticism of the film that it does seemingly waste an opportunity to get more out of hardy and while there are small moments of greatness and thankfully humour max heading off at nighttime to take care of a car full of bandits springs to mind his turn is not a highpoint of the film while criticism can be made of this aspect of fury road its also in an opposite effect a huge win for the film that it doesnt rely solely on the charisma or bulking presence of hardy to succeed and finds great moments when theron takes centre stage and in the moments from support from nicholas hoult as bad luck war boy nux and a fantastic bandit named doof warrior who takes inspiration from jimi hendrix with his axe work     an action event of recent times unparalleled equals and quite possibly one of the most purely visceral and intense action films ever made this wild and frightfully wild car chase is going to please fans of not only the mad max universe but cinema fans the world over george miller toiled long and hard to get his ultimate vision to our screens and after all his blood sweat and tears its fantastic to be able to say fury road is the great success that it is and hopefully the beginning of an all new saga for our beloved road warrior     4 and a half dedicated guitar players out of 5     for more movie reviews and opinions check into      
Aug 19 2015,positive,good action movie if you like this type of movie which i do the original is of course the best but the action special effects and badlands atmosphere was awesome  the biggest disappointment which annoyed me the entire movie was the darn rock band car it was over done and stupid  it added such a korny aspect to the scenes
Aug 19 2015,positive,stunt explosion shooting full throttle repeat
Aug 19 2015,positive,had some gaps in the story
Aug 19 2015,positive,what makes mad max fury road so great is that it sticks to the basics it puts its emphasis on great action and great performances the plot and the villain may be a little dry at times but its hard to care when you are having this much fun
Aug 19 2015,positive,easily the best and most innovative movie of 2015
Aug 19 2015,negative,this movie is the most dumb and idiotic movie ive ever seen it is created almost entirely out of car rides with minimal and incredibly cheesy emotion and plot the acting is terrible and the screenplay is even worse
Aug 19 2015,neutral,great effects  cinematography  was there a story
Aug 19 2015,positive,for those of use who can understand a story without having it all handed to us this movie is perfect miller doesnt hold our hands or feel the need to explain anything and that is a breath of fresh air in an industry where most directors think they have to give you an hour long backstory if you have a hope of understanding it miller throws you into the river and it is up to you to swim when you come up again you find yourself in a beautifully put together movie that grabs your hand and yanks you by the arm down its path until the final minute  leaving you with the sense that you have just sat through the greatest two hours in action movie history and that is what mad max is it doesnt pretend to be anything else it doesnt slap you across the face with politics or social issues and doesnt try to shove the directors ideals down your throat it is pure action unadorned and as naked as the wives if you are looking for max to deliver some deep monologue about his feelings you might be disappointed if you expect him to be max he is spot on
Aug 19 2015,positive,the movie can be simplified to a car chase simple and yet perfect in any way
Aug 18 2015,positive,this movie is completely insane action movies dont come this great these days watch this
Aug 18 2015,positive,who knew that literally 2 hours of explosions could actually be awesome to see and have a story
Aug 18 2015,positive,with the blend of practical and cgi effects beautiful cinematography and jaw dropping action mad max fury road is a welcome addition to the mad max anthology
Aug 18 2015,positive,one of the best movies of the year by miles no pun intended emotional thrilling and amazing to withhold
Aug 18 2015,positive,mad max fury road is the best action film of the year the 4th installment in the mad max trilogy simply about a car that goes the wrong way and needs to get back tom hardy fails to disappoint in this movie with amazing acting to portray the character of mad max but furiosa stands out the most in this movie one of the best female leads of the year mad max fury road is for sure a must watch if you like action films this movie has some the best visuals of the last 5 years max max fury road is the best in the franchise what a lovely day to rewatch fury road
Aug 18 2015,positive,30 years after the release of thunderdome mad max is finally back the lone wolf the single warrior the loner the lone soldier the outcast the outsider the man with no nameerrrnamed max the hype has been stratospheric for this one i have gone into this expecting truly mind blowing things the greatest action movie ever made lets see i will be brutally honest in every aspect    so the bottom line this is virtually based around one sequence from mad max 2 and made into an entire movie we all know which sequence the one with that bloody great gas tanker covered in gun turrets and spikes that sequence was epic on so many levels a truly award winning vision of distopian  science fictionwhere all the goodies get killed awesome now in this tale max has been captured by the war boys who are all led by immortan joe your standard gang of barbaric lunatics only this time not kitted out in sm gear no this time they are all painted up in a tribal sort of way long story short max has gotta reluctantly help out charlize therons character of furiosa with the help of nicholas hoults ill war boy character nux in saving some damsels in distress from joe whilst trying to reach some fabled lush green lands this of course equals a whole load of vehicle chases across the outback which basically never stop    the first sequence we see is maxs classic and gorgeous black pursuit special the now famous 1973 ford xb falcon gt getting trashed wait what i heard about this before hand and i have to say i dont like it one bit i wanted to see that fucking car in action once again damn it miller not quite sure how maxs super fast special manages to get wiped out by the collection of clown cars chasing him but never mind it bloody happened didnt it ugh    so one of the first things we see as the real story kicks in is immortan joes citadel which appears to built into a fecking massive cliff how the hell did they manage to do that theres like some sprawling catacombs in this rock by the looks of it i wouldnt of thought anyone had any time in between killing each other and building ridiculous killer automobiles this is actually one aspect that didnt sit well with me this whole idea felt way too grand and over the top for a mad max movie it looked like something from the lord of the rings trilogyonly with cars instead of orcs then if i really wanted to be picky i would ask how everyone is so muscular in this dead postapocalyptic world meh dont question it its here we start to see the strange freakish array of characters that inhabit this new earth gotta say i loved what i saw here for the most part miller has always been good at creating these bizarre characters for this franchise and he nails it again here    most of the bad guys are just big rippling baldies covered in white paint for some reason the war boys not much background given but they look intimidating for sure other citadel dwellers and bad guys come in various shapes and sizes such as the creepy looking corpus colossus a physically disabled child of joe with exceptional intelligence a real person with a real disability rictus erectus nathan jones a huge muscular mammoth of a man dimwitted and another son of joe the bullet farmer who is some ugly aging bloke in a suit of bullets andis a farmer hence is name the people eater is a big fat bald guy everyone is bald in the distopian future who i guess eats people again hence is name and the reason hes so fat he also looks to have lost his nose because he wears some kind of metal plate there the doof warrior who is some crazy blind bloke that rides a war rig the doof wagon into battle strapped to some huge speakers and playing a fire spouting guitar this guy seems to have become the new boba fett of the movie world but he doesnt actually do anything in fact i fail to see the point of him or the drummers other than simply to look cool admittedly he does look cool certainly unique with his mothers face for a mask oh yes but basically pointless    lastly we have immortan joe who is easily the most effective looking character ive seen in years his mask appears to be some kind of breathing apparatus that is attached to some kind of bellows around his neck the mask is slightly reminiscent of an old wwii pilots oxygen mask but with a terrifying line of big teeth like a skeleton not too sure about his ending though was his mask likeattached to has face and skull he also seems to wear some kind of transparent body armour with medals and whatnot attached obviously he suffers from some kind of affliction or disease visually this guy looks fucking amazing the makeup really tops it off with his pale ghostly complexion and silver balding widows peak hair line all in all the selection of characters gave off a very duneesque 1984 vibe in my opinion    the action is virtually constant here its the trademark of the movie and franchise nonstop the main bulk of the action centres around max and co trying to escape on the tanker under a barrage of gunfire and explosions now yeah weve seen this before in mad max 2 but this has been ramped up to maximum overdrive its insane there are vehicles being torn up and flipped all over metal mechanical shrapnel shattering all over the desert bodies are flying everywhere war boys are leaping around on pole vault type things hurling explosives gunfire stabbings fisticuffsall happening on and off various extreme vehicle creations it all looks completely real because all the stunts were real its highly impressive and shows great achievement in both eruptive action and practical effects on top of that the location work scenery shots panoramas and the crisp bold colour palette really look nothing short of gorgeous it almost looks too good for this type of movie gives you faith in movies again it really does    thats not to say the action saves it completely in my view amongst all this grade a action you do have to wonder how max joe and others manage to survive some of the horrific fender benders they get into the good guys battle their way away from the citadel all that way only to come back again and do it all again wut the canyon sequence stuck out as a very daft cheesy notion this biker gang that hides out there living in and around the canyon walls which they ride about onwith motorbikes bit risky isnt it also where did they all get their matching costumes when the good guys come back through the canyon do they go a different way didnt it get blocked off and it does all seem nuts that all this happens purely because joe wants his girls back he unleashes his entire armada and risks everything just for some ass cant you find more girls in your citadel oh and in the end the citadel bad guys just let max and co into their city and take over huh he just killed your leader    the greatest action flick ever hmmm not too sure about that its certainly up there but i still find myself preferring the gritty cult classic mad max 2 with gibson i think hardy does a reasonable job but he is no mad max if you ask me one thing i hated actually was the deliberate lack of dialog from max it worked well in the older films mm2 simply because there was less to explain mm2 was like a bloody 80s videogame it was so straight forward here there are things that could use background information plus the amount of times max gets into a situation mainly at the start where i really wanted him to just speak say something explain your situation to furiosa then she might not try to kill youugh i found that actually frustrating and it didnt need to be like that    still the fact that the goodies went back on themselves towards the end really made me groan frankly its like miller didnt know how to end it so he just made them go back and run the same gauntlet all over again easy option for more of the same i wont lie and say i didnt like it but i wont lie and say i thought it was a stunning movie the action is monumental at first but after the initial hardcore automobile carnage sequence things felt a little tamer the initial visual shock and awe that hit my eyeballs making them swell started to ease off so aweinspiring visuals all round and some great charactersvisually at least is this a good flick yes yes is it its a very engaging solid action movie buts lets not get too carried away its really a one trick pony if youre honest about it big gas tanker with goodies fights off hordes of baddies rinse wash and repeat until credits the only real difference is its furiosas story and to a degree nux too unfortunately max is just along for the ride in his 30 year old reboot
Aug 18 2015,positive,awesome movie look up the way its shot its incredible
Aug 18 2015,positive,the movie was best because of the awesome actions in this movie has for you
Aug 18 2015,positive,fantastic action tom hardy is amazing even with the limited dialog
Aug 17 2015,negative,yes there is action style and girl power however the paper thin plot doesnt give these elements enough context to carry any weight i could have followed this movie had it been silent
Aug 17 2015,positive,best film of the summer if not the year and the years only half over
Aug 17 2015,positive,there are new action sequence to be found made it a thrill to watch
Aug 17 2015,positive,loved it but not enough max
Aug 17 2015,positive,basically the perfect action movie constantly fantastical and mesmerizing  words cannot describe it adequately so just watch it if you havent
Aug 17 2015,positive,this is the first rotten tomatoes review ive ever written i could write pages upon pages about what makes this movie so great i could say how ive seen it four times and how i have friends who are going to see it their 2nd3rd times tonight the first time i saw it me and my buddy were so mesmerized by the film that we sat through every second of the credits which are like 15 minutes long blown away and speechless this was the most visceral immersive movie experience ive ever had gravity and avatar were also visceral and immersive but to even think about putting them in the same boat as mad max fury road is a joke before i ramble on and on ill keep it short and simple mad max fury road is the best action movie ever made i enjoy bringing people who havent seen it to see it so they too can experience what i think with time will be considered the best action movie ever by not just me but by the majority of longtime film critics see it twice three times see it ten times ive heard of someone who has seen it 11 times just make sure and see it once and get ready for rollercoaster adrenaline soaked 2 hour movie experience like no other all i can say is its so shiny so chrome
Aug 17 2015,positive,absolutely awesome one of the best action films this decade
Aug 17 2015,positive,absolutely awesome one of the best action films this decade
Aug 17 2015,neutral,way too much stuff happened in this moviefast paced confusing and too strange for my liking im not a fan of actionscience fiction films so i knew from the first 5 minutes that i wouldnt enjoy this movie i could understand people liking it but sadly not for me
Aug 17 2015,positive,while the practical stunts and beautifully shot action and chase scenes provide some nice eye candy mad max serves as a film that is only that and not amounting to an extensive plot or depth that other past action movies can display
Aug 17 2015,positive,the fourth movie in the mad max franchise and definitely one of the best  exceptional visuals great story and it stayed true to the mad max series
Aug 17 2015,negative,look worse than 90s bclass movies not sure why they had to relate this trash can movie to mad max as for standalone trash pit it would just decay in time but no it had to tarnish a legend  there are no more legendary movies just remakes and abominations like this one
Aug 17 2015,positive,mad max with a femme fatale amazing
Aug 17 2015,positive,great stunts and visuals  enjoyed this one
Aug 17 2015,positive,a great experience takes you and shakes you for most of 2 hours the story is thin dialogue is sparse and characters could use more dimension but somehow it all works with more plot or development the film would be even better as it stands its one of the best action films of the decade
Aug 16 2015,positive,movie was awsome and i recommend that you should watch the movie
Aug 16 2015,positive,this film is wild as it is aesthetically interesting i loved the story and found myself genuinely nervous in every action scene where a character was about to die my mother and sister almost teared up at one point over a character that had maybe 15 minutes of screen time charlize theron i think truly brings out the best in this movie with her stellar performance
Aug 16 2015,positive,very interesting movie
Aug 16 2015,positive,this is a movie that you need to see in theatres from seeing the sandstorm on the big screen to feeling the seats shake with the soundtrack i couldnt imagine seeing this movie on the small screen overall i give this movie an 8510 it is a great movie for anyone who likes action movies    mad max fury road is the 4th film in the mad max franchise it takes place in an apocalyptic future where fuel and water is scarce the plot revolves around max teaming up with furiousia after she frees a group of immortal joes the leader of the cult like city known as the citadel  sex slaves as they try to escape to the fabled green place    pros over all this movie was a great action movie therefor this movie had great action the action was all fast paced and exhilarating the range of different cars and weapons created many interesting and dynamic fight scenes each was fast paced and unpredictable while still making sense the character of furiousa was great her lack of lines is made up with the impact of her lines and the depth to her character the effects were great since it was mostly practical the little amounts of cgi all looked great  especially the sandstorm scene the soundtrack was awesome it was great how they actually integrated the soundtrack into to the action scenes it also took full advantage of the surround sound in the theatre at times the sound would actually make the sets shake the colour scheme was dynamic and the setting was great the dessert setting was used perfectly it was used in a wide range a ways that helped advanced the story for things like not having characters die when they fall and showing how far points were  from each other     cons max as a character was slightly flat the first act of the movie was hard to follow it seemed to just to flow from action scene to action scene without having much story in between another issue was the culture of the syndicate wasnt really explained this cause more confusion but eventually the audience is just forced to except it      this is a movie that you need to see in theatres from seeing the sandstorm on the big screen to feeling the seats shake with the soundtrack i couldnt imagine seeing this movie on the small screen overall i give this movie an 8510 it is a great movie for anyone who likes action movies
Aug 16 2015,positive,saw fury road thrice in the theatre and can say with certainty it is among the greatest most spectacular action films ever made its clear miller put his heart and soul into it and made every detail count the music the wasteland setting the dialogue the vehicles explosions stunts it had it all  if you arent visually mesmerized by this movie you need to check your pulse you may in fact be a corpse
Aug 16 2015,positive,solid acting gritty and realistic cinematography
Aug 16 2015,negative,this movie is pure trash i cant believe the high reviews this shit got wtf did we watch the same movie
Aug 16 2015,negative,while the cinematography and score were stunning the good traits of this film stop there how about having a compelling story or good dialogue or dimensional characters
Aug 16 2015,positive,it is one of the most intense dark  gritty and badass action adventure ive seen in a very long time watching this one feels like im living in the 90s or something it kinda reminds me on how cinematography is well executed without any nonsense or by putting huge explosions and overused cgi effects michael bay should take notes on this one the chasing scenes are the most brutal and jaw dropping as far as i can remember the movie is beautifully shot with well great pacing ive seen the last 3 mad max films but this one its just way beyond mad max it is superbly amazing in every way as far as the characters goes i like tom hardy as max he might be different compared to gibsons version of max but this guy nailed it but charlize theron as furiosa i think this character will be remembered she is super badass in this film she really brings the impact of this film the real hero till the end everything in this film is fantastic it will or should have a sequel thats for sure and people are furiously excited for the next one great job by george miller bring the franchise in a very high note
Aug 16 2015,positive,amazing ive watched it multiple times and it doesnt get old very very well done
Aug 16 2015,positive,it goes well with the other madmax series
Aug 16 2015,negative,i love action and sifi but this film is a complete mess  i hated it
Aug 16 2015,positive,bloody intense in every way brilliant
Aug 16 2015,positive,pure gold what can i say amazing action scenes interesting characters and amazing writing this is most well written film ive seen in a long time even better this is the best action movie ive seen in years i highly recommend it to anyone who wants an amazing movie my favorite film so far this year
Aug 16 2015,negative,an epic train wreck that should have been title mad mary sue tom hardy has all the charisma of a carrot just bad so bad my wife and i both said after watching it that we will never get that 2 hours of our life back the pole stunts were cool though other than that a real mess
Aug 16 2015,negative,i thought this was an awful moviethis is the first movie i walked out on in more than 20 years
Aug 16 2015,neutral,all the chasing made me dizzy  the breast pump scene where people are hooked up like factory cows and mad max has a bondage heavy metal slave mask it was more of a horror film to me and a bit disturbing   i didnt really get it
Aug 16 2015,positive,why did the trailer for this make it look bad this movie was simply one of the best action movies ive ever seen and one of the best movies of 2015
Aug 16 2015,positive,theres still hope for action movies
Aug 16 2015,positive,instant classic one of the best action movies ever and best movie of the year
Aug 16 2015,negative,nonsensical repetitive blechhh
Aug 16 2015,negative,so mad max is back after many years my wife and i watched it last night  it was okay obviously with todays technology and fx it was eye candy with michale bay type of crashes camera angles and explosions however  the story was seriously lacking however all the focus was on charlize therons character max maxs famous interceptor car lasted a whole 5 minutes in the movie while max himself spends almost 25 minutes of the movie stuck on the front of a large truck without really being able to talk  the story was seriously lacking in depth i watched mad max 1  2 just before the new one something was missing from this new movie it lacked feel and body  other strange things were added that i was not sure about the entire movie basically takes place on the back of one specialized fuel truck and that is pretty much it  the casting for max himself was not right either the actor tom hardy mumbled rather than spoke making his lines hard to hear he is no mel gibson   as a huge fan  i was not disappointing by the action trucks and weird cars as a screenwriter and person who loves a good story this one lacked in content
Aug 15 2015,positive,my favourite film in 2015
Aug 15 2015,positive,physical effects make a triumphant return to the ggi saturated season of summer blockbusters max rockatansky has emerged from the waste land in mad max fury road george miller aus 2015 to show us the light of epic cinema george miller gets another bite at the mad max apple and produces a lawrence of arabia 1962 david lean uk type epic while making a strong feminist statement in a post apocalyptic acid trip fever dream                             im not sure if it has anything to do with the uncanny valley but the epic scope of lawrence of arabia 1962 david lean uk versus revenge of the sith 2005 george lucas usa is apparent to anyone whose viewed both  cgi is helpful and can be a great asset to a filmmaker fury road has over 2000 visual effects shotsi that being said its not how much cgi you use but how you use it its the motion in the ocean not the size of the boat often millers use of cgi is used to color correct shots add clouds to the clear namibian sky and dessert rocks turned a much richer hue                          after screening mad max fury road george miller aus 2015 themes george miller was hinting at in mad max beyond thunder dome george miller aus 1985 became much clearer  the triple goddess helps redeem max when he is at his most feral his humanity holding on by a shred and our titular hero can only manage guttural sounds in lieu of language tom hardy plays the titular character in this latest mad max incarnation max fights to protect the maiden or in this case maidens he is aided and rescued by the mother and in this case the mother is the warrior imperator furiosa charlize theron crushes this role and lastly he is aided by the crone in millers post apocalyptic wasteland the crone is a bunch of motorcycle driving seed toting rifle shooting bad ass grandmas            at one point max washes blood off his hands using the contents of a tanker full of mothers milkthe themes in mad max fury road george miller aus 2015 are often not subtle but dont seem heavy handed in a movie that has little to no exposition in an era when movies find it necessary to have a pseudoscience explanation for our super heroes and science fiction its refreshing to have a movie not crow bar in needless exposition much like sergio leone miller uses action and his actors body language and facial expressions to convey story instead of relying on dialogue  in mad max fury road george miller aus 2015 theres no time to waste with monologues as the drums of war beat in the distance and a war party race towards you and among them is flame throwing guitar player strapped to a flat bed full of speakers racing down the dessert with dozens of other maniacs painted white oh did i forget to mention the maniacs in white body paint drive hot rods that have gentlemen with explosive spears ridding atop them                             ive heard the notion bandied around that george lucas is treated unfairly by adult fans who didnt like the prequels that the movies were not bad they were just now adults and not the target audience as they were in 1977 mad max fury road george miller aus 2015 takes that thesis and crumples it up and tosses it in the rubbish bin mad max 2 the road warrior george miller aus 1981  the star wars trilogy live in the same sweet spot in my preadolescent heart in fact they are probably neighbors and enjoying going over each others homes for summer bbqs or drinks around the holidays coincidently they live down the street from raiders of lost ark steven spielberg usa 1981 if my review hasnt been clear up till now stop reading this and go see this movie now  by jake cohen  5 out of 5 martin riggss recommend
Aug 15 2015,positive,brain off review oh my goodness this was so incredible it was all like pewpewpew and kaboomkaboomkaboom and the warboys were all like what a day what a lovely day and witness me and the guitar guy was all likeinhale this sick metal solo and the flamethrower on the guitar was all like fwoosh and furiosa was all like grab everything you can and run it was so cool    brain on review  an incredibly well made action film with underlying commentary about gender roles objectification of women faith hope creation destruction instinct and survival all streamlined into a movie littered with practical effects and where people spray chrome paint into their mouths  one of the best movies of recent years and my current favorite film of all time 100100
Aug 15 2015,positive,i felt like i was watching a rock n roll themed cirque du soleil performance and it was awesome
Aug 15 2015,positive,tremendous action packed thriller  charlize theron and tom hardy played off of each other very very well   some of the scenery and special effects were great  i go back to the beginning with mel gibson and tina  good film entertaining and worth the money  if you dont like viiolence and blood better skip this one and see a disney flick
Aug 15 2015,positive,a star off because in a world were gasoline is the man commodity no one seems concerned about fuel efficiency
Aug 15 2015,negative,too long and repetitive lots of action but all in the desert and with little storyline
Aug 15 2015,negative,this may be the most boring actionfantasy movie ive ever seen it was like watching someone play a computer game no deep dialogues mindless actionscenes and characters i couldnt care less about why this moviefranchise is so popular is beyond my understanding
Aug 15 2015,negative,you guys cannot be serious  this was a terrible movie  the plot was weak  the dialogue was garbage and the fast forward action scenes were annoying  ive seen the other movies  i get it but it was too over the top  then you got a mystery girl harassing max for whatever reason that was never revealed  we can all assume her intent and reasoning but i dont want to do that  then you got this guy suspended from cables along with his 4 drummers playing mall metal   the best part of the movie was when max smashed that guitar and interrupted that fiasco  and finally max played by tom hardy an awesome actor imo  for much of the movie i felt like i was watching dustin hoffman in rain man  i dont recall mel gibson mouth breathing for the majority of the other films  they made hardy seem like a grunting cromagnon man  movie was just painful to watch
Aug 15 2015,positive,great action film that never stop pumping adrenaline from minute one till the credits roll
Aug 15 2015,positive,boring really a car chase through the desert
Aug 15 2015,positive,amazing the cinematic imagination continues to grow with films like this the car chases and cinematography therein was spellbinding on the edge of my seat from the get go the plot worked well in the action and didnt service merely as a vehicle to deliver it hardy despite few actual lines and theron gave strong and engaging performances
Aug 15 2015,positive,one of the best postapocalyptic and action movies ive seen in this decade
Aug 15 2015,positive,very good film with all the usual madness of these films
Aug 15 2015,positive,not as good as i thought it wouldve been
Aug 14 2015,positive,this film is all about the action and my god does it pay off the insane and incredible action scenes are helmed fantastically with gorgeous mayhem and destruction everywhere
Aug 14 2015,positive,amazing movie with great plot and acting
Aug 14 2015,positive,a near perfect action movie     beautiful scenery beautiful cinematography beautiful well to some machines and most importantly of all beautiful people
Aug 14 2015,positive,this is the best action film of the decade youre crazy if you dont like this film
Aug 14 2015,positive,likely the best film in the last 10 years
Aug 14 2015,positive,although this movie was probably just an excuse to show off as much extraordinary special effects as they had to offer which couldve been a soulcrushing cgi void with no story they somehow managed to pull it off as a surprisingly wellrounded story with a not overly sexualized female lead something that many movies are sorely lacking in i will admit when i first saw the trailer i was unsure as to whether this would be any good but after seeing it in theaters i had absolutely no doubts it manages to stay surprisingly human while also completely suspending all logic with thrillingly insane action many people might say that there is no story however i would argue that one reason why its so good is its nuanced yet rich story for example the reason that the little girl in maxs mind is so haunting is because shes such an enigma we never fully see her backstory or get hit over the head with clunky exposition about it and yet she is an essential part of the story allinall i would say that out of the many i saw this summer this is by far the best action movie of 2015 full stop
Aug 14 2015,positive,this was basically just a two hour long chase sequence  an epic one though with some cool visuals and action but i was expecting more
Aug 14 2015,positive,every time someone ask to watch to this movie i join in great movie great acting just the madmax ive always wanted
Aug 14 2015,positive,best movie of the summer
Aug 14 2015,positive,a stale third act ruins an otherwise fantastic movie shame
Aug 14 2015,neutral,for medoesnt hold a candle to original felt like one very long chase scene 
Aug 14 2015,positive,good action good story
Aug 14 2015,positive,easily the best film of the summer and the fact that there is very minimal dialogue makes the cinematography that much sweeter beautiful stunning display of filmmaking
Aug 14 2015,positive,fuck it it was absurd and glorious and i want to watch it forty more times like a mad man
Aug 14 2015,positive,holy effin shitt this movie is bloody bonkers this is best watched in a cinema with great sound or in a friends insane home cinema like i did got sore eyes now cause i think i forgot to blink for 2 hours
Aug 13 2015,positive,i havent enjoyed an action film this much since terminator 2 judgment day
Aug 13 2015,positive,omfg so good from the start it was balls deep action
Aug 13 2015,positive,a very actionpacked film with incredible stunts it kept me entertained from the beginningend
Aug 13 2015,positive,that flame guitar great dystopia all characters are amazing i would like to see more of this movie like a prequel or something this movie is amazing but everything happens too fast
Aug 13 2015,positive,what a lovely day    2 weeks ago i wouldnt have seen this but the reviews started rolling in calling this the best movie of the year by far so i took my chances and saw it    holy shit holy shit holy shit    the reviews are all true this film is fantastic and by far better than any other mad max film produced to date its not one of those brainless action movies it has everything an thrilling story outstanding acting score that fits well and even makeupcostumes    of course the action is absolutely epic one of my very minor complaints though is that the film doesnt take full advantage of its r rating the film was action packed no doubt though and with our futuristic technology it became miles better than any of the other films    the performances as well blew my mind charlize theron is almost as badass as it gets she stole the show which brings me to tom hardy he was quite good and i think he was the perfect match for the role but he rarely had any lines so to me this seems more like a mad furiosa movie rather than a mad max one    of all the films i have recommended you to watch this one tops it all its a must watch but is not just mindless action it has a story and everything a good movie comes with if this film is out of my top 10 and even top 5 its going to be one heck of a year i dont know if anything will even compare to this in the coming summer
Aug 13 2015,positive,i have no idea why the critics rated it at 98 i enjoyed it wife hated it wasnt outstanding but i thought very entertaining
Aug 13 2015,negative,everyone else who rated this over a three must have been high  bad
Aug 13 2015,positive,mad max fury road is the best action movie ive seen in a long time it was so amazingly awesome i have never seen the original but that dosent matter i knew everything that was happening when this movie comes out on bluray i will buy it
Aug 13 2015,negative,i truly dont see why people praise this film boring and story is bullshit cinema has truly lost its magic
Aug 13 2015,positive,everything i was hoping for  morelives up to the reputation of the original 3
Aug 12 2015,positive,ahhhhso good brutal without being disturbing stark without hopelessnessapocalypse with a future that seems plausible just great intense filmmaking at its best
Aug 12 2015,positive,fast paced and over the top battle scenes keep you engaged all the way through  the post apocalyptic world is easy to get attached to
Aug 12 2015,positive,was a entertaining and intense ride down memory lane
Aug 12 2015,positive,one of the most intense action movies ive ever seen only complaint is that it tries a little too hard with the weirdness at points
Aug 12 2015,positive,this is my top best movie i have seen while its in theaters what makes this movie an incredible masterpiece from george miller is the nonstop vehicle fighting action scenes very amazing designed vehicles the location of the movie is apocalyptic and its in a real huge desert which is really cool the soundtrack has really interesting music to it and fits well for the movie tom hardy and charlize theron played their characters very well and the movie is well developed this movie is really something that i would watch again
Aug 12 2015,positive,just as weirdly awesome as all other mad max movies
Aug 12 2015,positive,you can take any frame out of the film and put it in the textbook
Aug 12 2015,negative,i dont know if its because of my taste in action films but this just wasnt good i was confused and annoyed half the time by all the plot holes and dumbass decisions from all the characters its only enjoyable if you completely turn off your brain before watching and even then there are too many boring parts that the few actually good action scenes just dont make up for

Aug 12 2015,positive,what an incredible action movie insanely good and probably one of the best action movies of this generation
Aug 12 2015,positive,mad max fury road was one of those rare action films which will leave a lasting impression in any movie goers mind i still remember flocking into the imax theatre for the very first time in my life in bangalore the screen was much bigger and clear in comparison to other theatre but then you cant really attribute all the amazement to the environment id say that this day was memorable only because of me being able to witness a film which would mark its place in cinematic history as one of the finest action movies of all time george millers vision is so captivating that the moment we see the brown sand simmering in the screen we know what this planet would be like in decades to come as the film progresses i kept wondering that how well were the scenes choreographed the action set pieces  characters make ups et cetera tom hardy and charlize theron acted well and played their part with absolute perfection but the real surprise to me was nicolas hoult he was a show stealer in some of the scenes especially the last one wherein he rams the car at rictus and mentions witness me
Aug 11 2015,positive,hands down the best movie of this summer george miller is a mastermind and he is not messing around
Aug 11 2015,negative,boring and ridiculously silly
Aug 11 2015,positive,the premise overall was ok but its blam blam blam mostly

Aug 11 2015,positive,pretty good and action packed
Aug 11 2015,negative,except for the title i god 0 feeling that this was a mad max movie hell it wasnt even about max it was about the girls trying to escape this film doesnt deserve to be called mad max anything yes its post apocalyptic and yes it kinda looks like it but meh was a total waste of time seeing this
Aug 11 2015,negative,shockingly cliched lacking any depth dull storyline with unbelievable characters awful
Aug 11 2015,positive,need i say anything
Aug 11 2015,positive,in an era of unnecessary nostalgiadriven cashgrabbing reboots mad max fury gives you the impression that this is the mad max movie george miller always wanted to make  this is the action film of the decade

Aug 11 2015,positive,one word describes mad max fury road masterpiece
Aug 11 2015,positive,and i thought the chase scene in the blue brothers was long
Aug 11 2015,positive,mad max fury road is the fourth installment in george millers series and i was slightly disappointed to get this straight the movie is pretty much a 2 hour car chase action packed and violent fury road gives you absolutely no plot whatsoever and at the end leaves you confused the movie makes no sense the only reason this review is getting its two stars are for the action sequences but when you leave the theater your going to ask your self what the heck was going on in that film if you like violence violence violence violence then this is your film you want a interesting story in this hyped film your sadly mistaken         grade c
Aug 11 2015,positive,just watched this yesterday   its totally an amazing film  so far its my favorite cant get enough between max  furiosa  they are amazing partners   i remember mr  mrs smith brad pitt  angelina jolie brangelina with them  wish that this would have a sequel     full of action packed scenes that will never make you bored absolutely a 55 movie recommended   redemption green max furiosa nux witnessme   charlizetheron tomhardy nicholashoult
Aug 11 2015,positive,this moving amazing every second i watch it action at every turn and everyone clap at the end
Aug 10 2015,positive,mad max fury road delivers old school action with a 21st century flare this is why we go to the movies to sit down and put logic to the side and be brought in by the characters and action tom hardy is great as mad max and  charlize theron is a bad ass with a heart of gold george miller keep it up
Aug 10 2015,positive,interesting moviegreat action scenes and cool stunts
Aug 10 2015,positive,loved it a master piece george miller has done it again
Aug 10 2015,positive,fast paced and full of action i thought the original was amazing but this tops it off
Aug 10 2015,positive,a nonstop action ride with great special effects and a story that was so easy  one dimensional and trite that you could taste the 80s throughout true to the original but then again the original had the same plot but with a better frontman or should i say frontperson
Aug 10 2015,positive,best film ive seen in over 10 years absolutely love fury road definitely one of those films that has to be experienced in the cinema for full effect
Aug 9 2015,positive,actionpackedi enjoyed this better than the original
Aug 9 2015,positive,mad max fury road was most definitely entertaining however with the hype and praise that it got i was expecting something a little better the plot was fantastic i will give it that as well as the acting i just feel like it missed something that separates it from a good movie to an amazing movie just a little disappointed in how it turned out when i saw it compared to the praise it got from others
Aug 9 2015,positive,exhilarating and surprisingly emotional fury road is possibly the best action movie of the decade and without a doubt a milestone in the action film genre
Aug 9 2015,positive,was actually pretty good
Aug 9 2015,positive,one of my favs of the year
Aug 9 2015,positive,theres no way to sum up the pure insanity of this film with the written word  if you missed it on the big screen i truly feel sorry for you  so many summer blockbusters feel like theyve had all their creativity and originality picked away to dumb it down for a mass audience  then along comes 75yearold director george miller who was given a big pile of cash and left all alone to continue his mad max franchise  tom hardy successfully steps in for mel gibson but otherwise this retains and actually improves upon all the elements that made the road warrior such a classic  while the performances production design and cinematography are all impressive its the fact this film relies on 100 practical effects and stunt work for its thrills  unlike every other megabudget movie hollywood barfs out mad max isnt drowning in pointless overthetop cgi  you know everything youre seeing on screen is actually happening and thats what makes it such an insanely enjoyable experience  if i have one complaint its that max pretty much remains on the sideline for much of the film  which is a shame considering what a great actor hardy is  heres hoping he comes out of his shell and is front and centre for the next chapter  otherwise this is without a doubt one of 2015s best
Aug 9 2015,positive,if you want to be sit down and be entertained for 2 hours with nonstop edge of your seat action this is the movie to watch
Aug 9 2015,positive,this movie is near perfect  although it would have been great to see mel back as mad max tom hardy does a great job of continuing the legacy of the character
Aug 8 2015,negative,the fact that anyone thought this movie was good shows that the people of this country dont care about story telling anymore  just explosions and death  im surprised death race isnt ranked higher due to this movie being ranked so high
Aug 8 2015,positive,just a amazing movie i rate 5 out of 5
Aug 8 2015,positive,phenomenal effects even better action this movie surprised me at every turn i want more
Aug 8 2015,positive,awesome lots of action and the girls kick some serious ass in this one
Aug 8 2015,positive,amazing movie  will have you at the edge of your seat
Aug 8 2015,positive,i guess im not old enough to know or have interest in the series but this would have been a good standalone film in itself  defiantly not a typical movie date  
Aug 8 2015,positive,best movie i have seen so far this year   amazing stunts  worth seeing it just for the choreography that went into the action sequences
Aug 8 2015,neutral,cant believe this is up for best picture on several contests including oscar  visually spectacular  but soon could not tell who was shooting and killing who  but then it really didnt matter as long as someone was shooting and killing someone
Aug 8 2015,positive,pretty cool movie never saw the originals but this was good
Aug 8 2015,positive,what a crazy beautiful awesome action movie
Aug 8 2015,positive,not being a great action flick should be pg13 a great wasteland film  90 out of 100 fresh
Aug 8 2015,positive,george miller did not make a movie he made a piece of art you can watch this movie without sound and still be invested in it it is a movie for the generations george miller will take you on a 2 hour epic masterpiece ride which will leave you stunned and amazed on how good this movie is
Aug 8 2015,positive,dont understand the high ratings of this movie  hardy  theron  co drives throu the desert to sell oil with enemies behind them  then wanted to go to the green field chased by the same enemies  have to turn back where they came from and killing a bunch of enemies and the leader on the way back  an idiot is playing guitar on a truck in the middle of the ride  fight 
Aug 8 2015,positive,taking one look at the theatrical poster for mad max fury road gives you all the suggestion you need that this wont be what you expect  the titular character is masked facing off screen his eyes fixed on something entirely different and partially eclipsed by a shaven headed badass woman in war paint shes close to us her eyes fixed just beside us right here with the problem at hand there is a lot of meaning in that arrangement as youll soon see     the postapocalyptic genre has seen an awful lot of come and go over the decades with sizzling hits and staggering failures throughout all because its a polarizing genre not everyone gets or enjoys it and some just cant stand the bleakness of the concept sure its bleak morbid even seeing the future of a destroyed world and the barren folk who still live there for those with a taste for adventures taking place after the world as we know it you pretty much cant beat mad max fury road     more so than any other film in recent years mad max fury road lives up to its title usually the words after the colon in a film title seem to be chosen entire at random like they just chucked a bunch of words like redemption and revelations into a bingo machine and just had at it  in mad max you better believe theres a road and damn is it fucking furious right from the asskicking opening our titular hero being captured by crazed white painted desert marauders you cant be ready for the chaos that will ensue as before you know it youre thrust along on a 2 hour nonstop high speed car chase through the wastelands of the world that once was     max has been captured by the foot soldiers of immortan joe the godlike leader of his own personality cult filling an entire city immortan joe holds the thousands under him in rapturous worship controlling all the water and all the power in the known region organizing cargo runs that control the supply of bullets and gas with sister cities across the wastelands joe is master of all he surveys most of all leading the white painted warboys who serve his wishes with an obsessed zealotism     setting his latest tanker full of supplies off on a run across the wastes joe basks in the idolatry from his audience unaware that what he holds most dear is being smuggled out from under his nose by his most trusted of soldiers the one armed sharp shooter furiosa  when furiosa turns off the planned course in her tanker taking the precious cargo contained within the enraged joe gathers a force unlike the world has ever seen to reclaim his property the poorfortuned max currently being used as a living blood bag to a sickened warboy is dragged along and strapped to the helm of one of a thousand revving cars trucks and crazed automobile monstrosities that blast out to give chase after furiosa from that point on all you can do is hold on for the ride    there are great characters at play through the action and theyre a huge part of what makes the film so enjoyable furiosa the driving badumtish force behind the heroes is as strong a character as youll see on screen today a brutal woman with a shattered past a killer shot and a meanmachine style mechanical arm its tough to take your eyes off her      the villains of the piece are works of art in themselves immortan joe himself is the echo of a military general crossed with a spiritual leader bearing a booming voice and a horrific breathing apparatus rigged to his face hes a great villain not just for his silver tongue and commanding screen presence but because he leads the forces of the wastelands at every turn personally hes a constant threat at the heels of the heroes not a distant enemy and it makes him a far more enjoyable villain  another fascinating personality at play amidst the chase is nux one of immortan joes warboys young feisty and desperate to please his beloved joe by any means nux drives a flaming classic car armed with explosives and a death wish nux is a wonderful alternate viewpoint to see the events of the film through so different from the cold determined logic of furiosa nux is impulsive obsessive and blinded by worship the travels of nux through the story is one of the films highlights  lost amidst the races and flames and fire blasting guitar players suspended from trucks max himself is there too its easy to forget the unfortunate man strapped to the front of nuxs car     max is an interesting spin on the classic action hero hes not as good a driver as nux hes not as skilled a shot as furiosa he has no personal vendetta against joe he doesnt know where hes going and hes just along for the ride he barely grunts a few lines of dialogue through the entire film thrust through the storyline set into motion by furiosa and contested between her goal and her enemies max is a lost soul who we can watch the crazed proceedings through who never overshadows the rest of the cast the titular hero is not the most interesting character so in a remarkably wise writing choice isnt hamfisted into being main focus     the closest thing i can compare mad max fury road to is a great anime film the old ones the ultraviolent apocalyptic worlds populated by the most crazed disfigured villains youve ever seen watching mad max put me back in the place of unique excitement i first found watching violence jack or md geist as a kid that crazy wild fun that you almost dont believe youre seeing for a moment from start to finish its larger than life its noisy and wild and it does not stop
Aug 8 2015,positive,this is the sequelremake that delivers on so many levels with some of the best action i have seen in a movie and great performances by tom hardy as max and charlize theron as furiousa this is a action flick that you shouldnt miss really no story though which is why it gets a 425
Aug 8 2015,positive,top notch really impressive thoroughly enjoyed  this film
Aug 8 2015,positive,nothing short of a miracle in the hollywood wasteland
Aug 8 2015,positive,a truly great action adrenaline rush movie with great actors and a weird villian
Aug 8 2015,positive,mad max is back in a big way  tons of action off the wall and memorable characters and a cool story that will gives the long dormant franchise a rebirth  my son and i loved the heavy metal flamethrower guitarist that hangs from people eaters vehicle like an ornament  who thinks of this stuff  tom hardy plays a much more introverted max than mel gibson so much so that it doesnt even feel like the same character  charlize theron steals the show as furiosa
Aug 8 2015,positive,you had me at fire guitar guy
Aug 7 2015,positive,in a world of disastrous remakes mad max is a standout success they delivered exactly what was promised and stuck to nonstop action in a dystopian future i particularly enjoyed the switch up of making therons character furiosa the main protagonist while using hardys max on only a slightly lesser scale
Aug 7 2015,positive,was ok nothing special
Aug 7 2015,positive,now this is a artistic action cinematic masterpiece of this generation george millar is still the master of auto carnage even after over 20 years since his previous entry in this installment this is clearly an update of one the best sequels in film history the road warrior beautifully shot and well crafted film with also great performances from tom hardy charlize theron and nicholas hoult this is a great reminder of why i love action films to begin with
Aug 7 2015,positive,good movie thought it was fun
Aug 7 2015,positive,one of the best action films ive ever seen possibly the best action movie this decade favorite movie of the year so far
Aug 7 2015,positive,mad max fury road  review    plot  in a postnuclear desert dystopia we follow the story of road warrior max and rebel furiosa and their attempt to overthrow the patriarchy  review  a lot of people claim that this film lacks plot and dialogue it is to my belief that people have become accustomed to over complicated plots over explanation and too much exposition this film really stripped filmmaking techniques back to basics all of the characters are defined by what they do and not what they say i think that by using this technique they have proven that simple really is best the plot follows the story of four rape victims and a military rebel as they escape from a vicious warlord they are then faced with joining forces with max who for the most part doesnt really say much whilst a lot of people have put the lack of dialogue down to broody characters tropes i believe that the use of silence to explore how the characters are feeling is well done do you honestly believe that prisoners of war would have much to say it is implied that max hasnt spoken to another human in quite a while and i think his lack of dialogue shows that he isnt comfortable or trusting i think the characters are incredibly complex and although they are difficult to connect with you do root for all of the characters because of the lack of dialogue we only know what max knows and i think that really establishes the lack of trust between the characters this keeps the audience on their toes constantly we are most certainly along for the ride with max   in terms of story i personally interpreted this as a social commentary on feminism with the main plot line of four rape victims running from the warlord master it is to my belief that the film comments on female life and where it is in terms of a hierarchy in gender there are also numerous other scenes which really make the audience think about issues other feminist centric issues there is a scene in which a pregnant woman is heavily injured and the warlord without question cuts open the womans belly to save the life of a child which poses the question when did a fetus life become more important than that of a 20 ish year old women just an interesting thought because regardless of whether or not you yourself would or wouldnt have an abortion shouldnt the choice be that of the womans who in this case bled to death after having a csection to save the rape child of her warlord whilst the events in the film are dramatized for the purpose of storytelling the incidents strongly resemble issues that span outside of first world feminism such as fmg child marriage  sex trafficking  in terms of climax the whole film builds up to a fantastic female lead victory in which the warlord is murdered by his other rape victims and the group of misfits head back to society in which they live to offer equality for all  the visual aspects of the film consist of steam punk inspired desert warriors with exciting and unique editing shout out to margaret sixel the editor who did an incredibly bang up job the editing was innovative new fast  captivating the majority of the film was made up of practical effects and it was brilliant everything seemed so real and i really felt like i was part of the chase  perks to this film   female lead cast   disabled female protagonist   social commentary on the patriarchy    makes you question world issues    teaches us about inclusive feminism   a brilliant narrative and wellwritten characters  if you havent seen this film already go watch it if you arent really a fan of strong female characters you wont like this film over all this film is a fresh view on the social commentary of the societal patriarchy and hierarchy of gender and i loved it
Aug 7 2015,positive,a fresh and thrilling adventure in a dead world
Aug 7 2015,positive,surreal awesome heart pounding  keeps you on the edge of your seat
Aug 7 2015,positive,awesome action story eh
Aug 7 2015,positive,didnt know what was going on till it got going then realizing its just action everywhere pretty good movie without a actual storyline
Aug 7 2015,positive,charlize and tom are excellent violent and raw as expected i enjoyed it
Aug 7 2015,positive,by far the best mad max filmgeorge miller is back
Aug 7 2015,positive,fast furious and intelligent the smartest action movie of its kind a script that does not ignore anything in it all of the scenery dialogue and action is relevant    basically stop what youre doing and watch mad max fury road the best film of 2015 period
Aug 6 2015,negative,the worst movie i have ever seen no story horrible script no connection to the characters just a stack reel of visual effects who cares
Aug 6 2015,positive,oh what a lovely day
Aug 6 2015,positive,wild exciting actionpacked and strange made max fury road is bolstered by its excellent production design and good performances with a lot of crazy and exhilarating action
Aug 6 2015,positive,a unique movie on every perspective less talk and more action
Aug 6 2015,positive,cool movie but by the end of the movie i felt ready for it to be over
Aug 6 2015,positive,high action low plot great visuals
Aug 6 2015,positive,meh not terrible but not all that exciting
Aug 6 2015,positive,a postapocalyptic allegory that is comprised of high octane chase scenes and surprisingly emotional relationships between characters who barely speak compared to most films it only has one problem which is the poor dubbing of what seems like almost all of tom hardys dialogue but in the grand scheme of things its barely noticeable
Aug 6 2015,positive,damn i never knew i could like an action movie this much made me want to watch the original 3 this movie was out of this world awesome
Aug 6 2015,positive,exceptional raw action flick with a strong mythos and complex universe it is hard to contribute meaningfully to the bloated postapocalyptic genre these days without invoking eyerolls but this film stands out this is one of the few recent examples of how good screenwriting and production respect for storytelling can elevate very simple premises the strong performances help performances that also elevate the occasionally ridiculous script and give it hard hitting depth tom hardy is sensational despite being effectively mute and muzzled for a great deal of the film   the attention to detail in the visual style narrative universe and cinematography is worthy of accolade and is probably the reason such an outrageous movie is so immersive   i saw it twice within a week
Aug 6 2015,positive,alright i may have been too harsh on mad max fury road initially i still dont think it is in any way a masterpiece but the action sequences are glorious and at times truly thrilling george miller cant be praised enough for avoiding cgi as much as possible and instead relying on deathdefying stunt work and a huge lot of practical effects its hard to imagine how much planning and rehearsal had to go into orchestrating these sequences of pure exhilaration still there is not much beyond the fireworks to hold everything together the actual story isnt all that compelling or surprising and a tad more characterization would have been welcome when it comes to dramatic weight fury road is fairly bare bones to say the least there are also a lot of stylistic flourishes that i just didnt really care for with that said the extended chases are certainly impressive and the cinematography and editing is truly outstanding
Aug 5 2015,positive,weird but great action
Aug 5 2015,positive,modern classic completely faithful to the movies before it george miller has outdone himself
Aug 5 2015,positive,this movie was massively hyped for me from reviews and movie fan comments so expectations were very high for me id seen many say that it was the best pure action movie of the last 10 years did fury road live up to those expectations for me mostly yeah i wasnt a fan of the original movies though i did have a small fondness for beyond thunderdome and thankfully mm fury road blows those movies out of the water which is pretty fantastic that the originals director is the directorcreator here with the film technology and budget present george miller seems to have made the mad max movie hes always wanted to i assume perhaps having had 30 year to think about that world he came up with better ideas after his original movies so is this the best pure action movie of the last 10 years im not sure though surely theres not much competition the old school action movie is mostly dead with comic book movies and martial arts movies taking their place i dont consider comic book movies to be part of the pure action movie genretype so that seems to mostly leave martial arts movies i feel asian cinema is still the leader in action scenes but fury road comes close its certainly the best action chase movie that i can think of since terminator 2 beyond all of the ranking the movie itself is great its hard to single out any moments of greatness and ill just single out the whole movie as being awesome charlize theron is the real action hero of the movie not tom hardy as max she has the best female action hero character since at least uma thurman as the bride in kill bill and a spiritual successor to again sarah connor in terminator 2 she just rocked the whole movie and tom hardy really takes a back seat in his own characternamed movie also this is the first movie in 20 years that while watching i was thinking i want these vehicles to be toys i can buy im not a car guy but the different vehicles in this movie were so freaking cool great movie
Aug 5 2015,negative,awful movie an insult to the mad max series a 2 hour mindless meaningless exhausting vehicle battlethats it just visual candy that gets boring after 15 minutes miller makes no effort in developing or caring about the characters
Aug 5 2015,positive,incredible with adrenalin turned up to 11 and the golden sundrenched saturation is overwhelming this intense and relentless very repetitive its just loud action and ballstothewall driving like all the fucking time but incredible you can tell this is the exact film george miller wanted to make its clearly his perfect postapocalyptic vision of the earth and it is beautiful its a bit odd that max is a bitplayer in his glorious return to the screen but it doesnt really matter this movie is stunning and judging by the success of the film it should hopefully herald the return of proper rrated action films
Aug 5 2015,positive,fury road forgoes any sort of clunky exposition in favor of visually showing the viewer the disparity of the wasteland onscreen pulling the viewer into the world in the best way possible with fantasticallyshot action sequences a heartfelt and heartpumping story and possibly the best characters to grace the franchise mad max fury road is the best that an action film can get and its quite possibly my favorite action film of all time
Aug 5 2015,positive,wow i love this movie so much
Aug 5 2015,positive,i found the plot to be thin and somewhat cliche but the action sequences which comprise essentially the entire movie are extremely entertaining and wellexecuted its dark and it pretty much offers heartpounding adrenalinefueled mayhem from the start and all of the nonstop action and great visuals may be enough to overlook any shortcomings
Aug 5 2015,positive,great movie non stop action
Aug 5 2015,positive,a movie that even without script i will still enjoy it
Aug 4 2015,positive,a little late to the party but whoa another intelligent action flick by miller
Aug 4 2015,positive,great movie a lot of action a lot of fun and i mean its charlize theron for gods sakes
Aug 4 2015,positive,postapocalyptic freaky steampunk fun just like the first mad max movie
Aug 4 2015,positive,a reboot of the original franchise and only good for the nonstop action instead of the actual story
Aug 4 2015,positive,mad max is a must see movie whether youve seen the originals or not this film is a spectacle with some of the best action scenes that ive ever seen the best part is that its practical the scale of this film is unreal and you feel immersed in it the cast does a fantastic job with everything as well go see it if you havent
Aug 4 2015,positive,absolutely amazing this actually has a good story good characters and really great action
Aug 4 2015,positive,loved it need to watch again so many things i feel like i missed the first time
Aug 4 2015,negative,i walked out after the first 12 to 15 minutes  did i miss anything
Aug 4 2015,positive,not the same as the original
Aug 4 2015,positive,i have seen the score happens to be fabulous but i must say i did not get the bang i had anticipated i enjoyed it but thought not enough of the movies was upgraded
Aug 4 2015,positive,ok could have waited until it was free on tv to watch just ok
Aug 4 2015,positive,a start to end action movie with no wasted scenes this is what fast and furious should really look like 
Aug 3 2015,positive,this movie was definetely shiny and chrome
Aug 3 2015,positive,great action adventure movie with so very good special effects i would watch it again
Aug 3 2015,positive,my pick for 1 action movie of all time
Aug 3 2015,positive,terriffic movie that contains amazing visual effects  mad max fury road gets an a
Aug 3 2015,positive,i wasnt expecting what i got but what i got was aaaamazing i was on the edge of my seat and having panic attacks the entire length of the movie intense is an understatement but worth the ptsd
Aug 3 2015,positive,looked exactly like my nightmares i get sometimes and i loved it post apocalyptic action done right charlize theron just became my favorite actress wow
Aug 2 2015,positive,colorfully vivid visually stunning technically flawless and throughoutly adrenaline pumping fury road is a great reincarnation of george millers apocalyptic wasteland with gleeful insanity and a strong female role to boost
Aug 2 2015,negative,i have more dialog with myself in the bathroom the rev of the engines was one of the things that made the original movie every motor in this movie is silenced or drown out by some other sound there was some pretty incredible looking machines in this movie and was just so disappointing not to hear any
Aug 2 2015,positive,just an absolute great movie with great action i havent like him in the past but he does a great job in this movie
Aug 2 2015,positive,wow it is worth of waiting for this epic
Aug 2 2015,positive,best action movie in a long time
Aug 2 2015,positive,this movie is ducking awesome
Aug 2 2015,negative,big in scalebut very poor enjoyment
Aug 2 2015,positive,nonstop practical action sequences beautifully colorful visuals and as narratively hefty as the stunts themselves
Aug 2 2015,negative,to quote an imdb critic nobrainer actionpacked movies without a story 2 hours of non stop rubbish without dialogue
Aug 2 2015,positive,new cast but a fantastic new film in the spirit of the original franchise
Aug 2 2015,positive,epicycles underwatched fury road is probably the best film of 2015 by far it will take a lot to top it
Aug 2 2015,positive,the best action sequences ive ever seen in a movie and at the same time it was such a good story how did they do it
Aug 2 2015,neutral,mad max fury road is such a let down with a bland story  bland characters it saves itself a little bit with beautifully shot action sent pieces but ultimately fails in all other areas a real shame
Aug 2 2015,positive,best hard on movie of the year it has women it has cars it have mutants it has deranged villains and it has post apocalyptic futuristic shit this movie is a movie that i think everyone should watch it is fucking mad max and in this day and age everyone needs another hero the best hero that ever was is back and this movie is no joke if you are reading my review and your a feminist and believe this movie is sexist then your a just a dumb cunt there is nothing sexist about this movie it is a car chase that will get your old pussy penetrated without lubricant because your pussy is already dripping from beginning to end i do recommend this movie to anyone who in the 90s stood up late and watched mad max on tbs this movie is the perfect sequel to a trilogy that a lot of people forgot all i can say is thank you george miller for bringing it back and thank you tom hardy for playing a damn good role as max
Aug 1 2015,positive,best actiom movie ever and the score loved it
Aug 1 2015,positive,not what i expected blew me away 
Aug 1 2015,positive,heres this years best postapocalyptic science fiction film which wonderfully restarts a franchise that has influenced a whole number of scifi films partly rebooting george millers first three films this film acts as a mad max for a new generation of filmgoers     the film is one big chase with ten or fifteen minutes of a breather so the audience and characters can take a short rest before the final big action piece    tom hardy fills mel gibsons shoes nicely making max a gruff and silent character hardy brings real charisma to the role proving that hes definitely the next big actor in the industry charlize theron commands the screen nicely working alongside hardy perfectly as a tough nononsense woman who isnt the usual damsel in distress theron is tough and calculating nicholas hoult is terrific as a young man who joins max and therons character furiosa on their journey and hugh keaysbyrne is truly menacing as the central villain immortan joe rosie huntingtonwhiteley riley keough zoe kravitz abbey lee and courtney eaton are also excellent as joes wives also being very fierce in the film as strong women    the film centers on max who is kidnapped by joes forces and used as a blood donor max than teams up with furiosa who has saved joes wives from imprisonment which results in joe leading his forces after them to retrieve his wives    the action which is mostly practical is outstanding in the film since most of the film is one big chase wonderfully staged seeing the use of practical effects over cgi is a welcome relief when many films now a days have started to mostly focus on cgi which with most films have been very tiring the chase as the practical effects wonderfully supports the plot further moving the characters along and the story while even going in unexpected directions that you dont see coming    the cinematography which goes away from the desaturated look of most apocalyptic films is very colorful for the day it is orange and for night blue which gives a very beautiful original look to the whole film john seale actually came out of retirement to shoot the film bringing a very new and different look to the genre junkie xls music is action packed and very explosive supporting the action chase aspect of the film and the characters the music like the film never calms down    the film also acts as a great new take on the first three films this film mainly intended as a new take for a new generation going into this film you dont even need to see the first three films since miller who also directed the first film in 1979 mad max and its two sequels allows this film to feel new and fresh while flashbacks are shown of maxs family being killed the approach is new in a way which works very well for a new audience going into this for the first time    the film also does a good job of empowering women and giving them strong roles which supports this film very well there have been a few men rights groups who have criticized this move since they feel that this has put max in the background even though they havent seen the film when an article on this topic was revealed during the films release max is still given a central role just as much as theron while the film allows all of the characters man and female to be very strong this works very well since the film is trying to go against female slavery which joe the villain is trying to do enslaving his wives so he can have strong children    the end result is a film that is not only terrific but utterly outstanding doing something that has been seen before no doubt that this film will live for ages and also change the science fiction genres and take it in a completely new direction this is a film everyone needs to see
Aug 1 2015,positive,lots of action but quite dark and barbaric but all in all it was quite entertaining
Aug 1 2015,positive,good action movie with a decent script for the genre the photography is really good too but in the end it is quite repeating itself from beginning to end and the stormy ost is exhausting
Aug 1 2015,positive,interestingly shot weird concept did not see the first movie
Aug 1 2015,negative,no plot no character development every line was bad dont waste your money watching it in theaters
Aug 1 2015,negative,the whole movie is just one long desert car chase from a to b and then back again complete waste of time  210
Aug 1 2015,neutral,done well but not for me and not for you unless you are a twelve year old boy
Aug 1 2015,positive,mad max  crazy unequivocally great not much else to say about that
Aug 1 2015,positive,two hour long car chase feminist propaganda plenty of crazy and george millers colorful style
Aug 1 2015,positive,hell yeah badass movie action all the way
Aug 1 2015,negative,if this movie was call armageddon 3000 we will not see the difference  the main character mad max has the same amount of dialogue that the second character furiosa maybe less  the voice of mad max was also recorded no live microphones just like batman the dark knight rises why   it may be the intention of the director to have a red dessert but it took out the original vision of real apocalypse to an artificial one    in respect the amount of hard work it took to make this movie but i cant recommend it
Aug 1 2015,positive,a heartthumpingly great cyberpunk actioner that pulsates with smarts energy thrills postapocalyptic quandaries and inventive kookiness you can hardly feel the two hours seriously that good
Aug 1 2015,positive,wall to wall action very captivating story line and great acting definitely worth watching at least once
Aug 1 2015,positive,awesome hate that mel gibson wasnt in it but do believe they kept to the spirit of his movies
Aug 1 2015,positive,if you are a fan of the mad max series this is a must see
Jul 31 2015,positive,if you like tons of action with little backstory this is your movie
Jul 31 2015,positive,pretty cool movie nonstop action once the action started
Jul 31 2015,positive,fun for the first time second time its boring
Jul 31 2015,positive,this movie was so fucking kickass miller only fucking did it if tom hardy didnt think that he was playing a literal gorilla then it would of been even better
Jul 31 2015,positive,absolutely stunning and definitely the best movie of 2015 thus far
Jul 31 2015,negative,i have no idea why this movie has received so many good reviews  i absolutely love action movies but even for me i found this endless chase movie ridiculous and tiring  they had zero character development or plot it was basically one endless chase scene going in a straight line through a desert doesnt that sound exciting
Jul 31 2015,positive,i think this is an acceptional movie
Jul 31 2015,positive,dystopian fast and furious amazing action sequences that is basically the whole film that brings in george miller a director who knows how to make a great action film with practical effects strong characters action sequences that are nonstop fun and a story that has depth and emotion to it that brings back the franchise back to life with a hell of a bang by far one of the best films if not the best so far of 2015 a must see
Jul 30 2015,positive,good movie but was missing something
Jul 30 2015,positive,really great movie nonstop action and great effects
Jul 30 2015,neutral,this movie is basically 2 hours of car chases albeit nicely done car chases with a very thin plot and thats being kind living on the mad max franchise and a strong female lead nicely acted but bad script saw the movie solely based on good reviews but left terribly dissappointed and feeling like i just watch nothing but car chases loosely strung together by barely any plot or in other words a fast  furious movie
Jul 30 2015,positive,great movie  great addition to the mad max story action packed begining to end
Jul 30 2015,positive,one of the best movies i have ever watched just pure adrenalinefueled awesomeness is what this movie has to offer honestly walking out of the movie theater i felt like punching someone but had to remind myself that i wasnt a lawless brute    why are you still reading the reviews anyway you could be spending this time watching the movie
Jul 30 2015,positive,greathad to see it again awesome
Jul 30 2015,positive,a revolution in the art of movie mad max brings forth a fascinating postapocalyptic universe created by director george miller
Jul 30 2015,positive,i really enjoyed this movie
Jul 30 2015,positive,this is amazing and a masterpiece i hope the sequels recive the same review i win more at thebox office oand more big bugedt and more running time i hope the secon con 2017 or 2018
Jul 30 2015,positive,phenomenal masterpiece
Jul 30 2015,positive,best movie of the year and one of the best action films that ive ever seen
Jul 30 2015,positive,crazy over the top and by far the most competently crafted action movie made in a generation
Jul 29 2015,positive,over the top action from start to finish glad i saw on the big screen cause it deserved it kudos to miller again for making a visually stunning affair not even edgeofyourseat actionmore like knock you out of your seat action
Jul 29 2015,positive,heart pounding adrenaline fueled and most of all practical mad max fury road is a lesson on how to do action right served up by a 70 year old man take that hollywood
Jul 29 2015,positive,having never seen the originals nor played the games i must ascertain that this is an outstanding epic  tom hardy goes above and beyond to demonstrate yet another persona of the acting world of which he can portray to perfection  the action is riveting  the narrative is enticing  you will be sucked into this from the opening scene looking out across the desert  the use of subtle imagery throughout is like that of little pleasurable gifts to the viewer scattered about eg the lizard behind hardy in opening scene  there is no need to be familiar with the backstory for this one and it is to the viewers advantage that they might go in unknowing of what is about to take place
Jul 29 2015,positive,brisk pace continuous action made the movie worthy of its remake status
Jul 29 2015,positive,fury road plays out almost like an experiment lets see if we can have 2 hours of amazingly choreographed car chases using as much practical effects possible and still remember to have a great story and characters to go with it the answer is surprisingly yes
Jul 29 2015,positive,actionpacked thrill ride the entire movie there isnt much in the way of a plot but its mad max who cares
Jul 29 2015,positive,this is by far the best film of the summer  i feast of action and drama  i will say that while it did a great job of capturing the essence of the original films it was lacking the hardcore sensory overload  punk rock feeling that the first two films had  not necessarily a bad thingi just missed that feeling
Jul 29 2015,negative,movie relies too much on formula  mindless action sequences minus meaningless plot plus poor dialog and hopes that the outcome turns out positive and fails to succeed at that more often than not poor or none introduction to the lore of mad max leaving you in blessed ignorance if you really want to enjoy this movie switch your brain of and marvel at the colorful scenery and fast action
Jul 29 2015,negative,two hours of unsuspenceful action with tidbits of good crazy bonkers action sprinkled in but not nearly enough to warrant the time limit and lack of character development
Jul 29 2015,positive,actionpacked with many original stunts and great storytelling doesnt hurt that there are some stong characters
Jul 29 2015,neutral,theron and hardy are the heart of the film most of the budget seems to have been spent building the vehicles and shipping them to namibia there is little dialogue but more than enough stunts and action
Jul 28 2015,positive,mad max fury road is without question the height of action filmmaking greatness a flatout heartinyourthroat deranged showstopper that punches brawns grit and cinematic ferocity back to the hollywood blockbuster without ever sacrificing emotional fullness it also unexpectedly lobs a bold equality statement in the form of charlize theron whose imperator furiosa joins the group of cinemas great feminist fighters along with ellen ripley in aliens and sarah connor in terminator 2 judgment day mark my words this film will be touted as one of the ultimate action masterpieces of our time
Jul 28 2015,positive,assigned to drive a massive truck to collect gasoline furiosa charlize theron has another plan once there is a good distance between the vehicle and her starting point she would veer offtrack and return to her homelandalong with five wives of cult leader immortan joe hugh keaysbyryne a hot pursuit erupts with ailing nux nicholas hoult chained to a prisoner named max tom hardy hoping to impress immortan joe so he can be welcomed to valhalla when he dies    mad max fury road directed by george miller is an orgasmic visual exercise of yelloworange sand sweltering heat vehicle acrobatics dramatic explosions and deformed heavy makeupwearing citizens of a collapsed world bound by no rules even without a deep story it engages thoroughly because the images are so hyperbolic there is not one film that is remotely like it in the past decade    the action scenes are inspired and creative the picture is composed of one long chase sequence but there is variety in the counters between heroesheroines and villains with each geographic change we get an idea about the group of people who live within that area particularly memorable is the biker gang waiting atop a narrow canyon a deal has been made between the gang and furiosa based on how the scene is shot as our protagonists enter the canyon we know immediately that something is about to go wrong    such is the films strength it is shot with a sense of urgency although the narration in the beginning briefly describes the circumstances that led to humanitys decay we remain curious about its universe nonetheless because it does not spell out every detail as the characters trek across dry terrains we discover the journey with them for instance the challenge is not only avoiding or eliminating those who try to kill them all characters must also be wary of and be prepared for the cruel environment that awaits    at times the picture attempts to do too much a romantic connection is introduced eventually which does not work at all the problem is we have a basic understanding about only half of the wouldbe couple character depth and development is not one of the films strengths and so such a desperate attempt to get us emotionally involved through a romantic scope comes across as forced and unnecessary sometimes less is more    the two leads hardy and theron and two supporting actors hoult and keaysbyrne are a joy to watch because they are unafraid to exaggerate their emotions to look unattractive physically to embody their deranged characters completely each one commands a high level of creative energy and so he or she is front and center there is a magnetism and charisma to the performance we are inspired to learn more about each one of these characters and yet the material has a way of always keeping us at arms length perhaps we are not meant to get to know these people for their world is so different than ours they might as well have been of a different species    written by george miller brendan mccarthy and nick lathouris mad max fury road is a visual spectacle but there is room for some improvement as mentioned previously i see potential as a modern franchiseone that is not about superheroes or chosen ones destined to save a dystopian world but one that is about a decaying world and the degenerates who are struggling to survive in it    filmrevieworg
Jul 28 2015,positive,in an age where movies about dystopian futures are a dime a dozen mad max fury road presents a truly horrifyingly beautiful take on the collapse of society with solid acting performances all around i enjoyed this installment more than any other in the franchise
Jul 28 2015,positive,best action movie in years its a simple story told very well the visuals are outstanding this movie is well shot well directed the action sequences are thrilling the choice to use practical effects and real stunt work with minimal cgi effects pays off this movie does car chases better then the king of car chase movies fast and furious charlie therons performance and character drives the movie her character adds enough emotional value for you to care about the characters on a deeper level this is movie is a must see
Jul 28 2015,positive,too much noisetoo much actionnot my favorite
Jul 28 2015,positive,where the hell did i see this
Jul 28 2015,negative,if i could have less than half a star i would
Jul 28 2015,positive,this is how a movie should be exciting eyegrabbing and genuine it appears everyone involved worked with such a passion that they have created one of the greatest films of the 21st century
Jul 28 2015,positive,possibly the most exhilarating action film ive ever seen
Jul 28 2015,positive,an absolutely breathtaking action movie with the best car chases scenes in the history of cinema to date but i cant imagine a movie outdoing these though this features a good physcial mostly nonverbal performance by tom hardy its charlize theron and nicholas hoult are the two who actually carry this movie a decent story very good acting and the best practical effects ive seen in a really long time this is my favorite movie of 2015 so far
Jul 28 2015,positive,theron hardy and hoult shine in this gripping actionpacked film thats a race from beginning to end
Jul 28 2015,positive,i find it ironic that a lot of men dislike this film because of the female protagonists finally strong women who werent sexualised finally not a dull romance with no depth that every other director seems to must include in his action film nice action scenes funny but also dramatic with a little more brain
Jul 28 2015,positive,mad max fury road delivers the action charlize theron is brilliant as furiosa tom hardy takes the mad max torch and runs with it the story is simple with a twist the characters are as crazy as the cars and their battle music
Jul 28 2015,positive,action from beginning to end
Jul 27 2015,positive,never was a huge fan of the mad max films yet this one seemed special when i first saw the trailer movie was done right and was visually amazing my only problem was they showed to much in the trailer and i felt like the movie was short but maybe thats cuz i loved it so much defiantly on my top 5 favorite movies ever
Jul 27 2015,positive,who didnt love this movie and why everyone i know loved this movie
Jul 27 2015,positive,one of the best postapocalyptic movies ever made definitely the best mad max film
Jul 27 2015,negative,not the same from the og
Jul 27 2015,positive,the best action movie of the 21st century no contest stunning achievement for george miller and a wake up call to real artists in film age is just a number
Jul 27 2015,positive,classic george miller free of cgi penguins and hollywood sterilization the movie is nonstop action punctuated by beautifully crafted setpiece moments and an unexpected level of emotion and sincerity charlize theron also delivers and arguably oscar worthy performance crafted for fans of the road warrior but certainly enjoyable for people new to the series
Jul 27 2015,positive,was a nice edition to the series a good amount of action and all tho nudity could have been better guess lack of quality was not a concern
Jul 27 2015,positive,highly entertaining
Jul 27 2015,positive,youre mad if you didnt watch this film
Jul 27 2015,positive,like everything and nothing youve seen before by far the most entertaining film of 2015
Jul 27 2015,positive,fudging brilliant this one and road warrior our my 2 favorite mad max films i suggest it it shows a more realistic version of how mad max or the wasteland would be in real life i cannot wait for this to come out on dvd and think its brilliant that the main bad guy from the first one is back as the main bad guy in this one but portraying a different person and i hope they will make another sequelremake or whatever its classed as
Jul 27 2015,positive,this movie is maddening freaking awesome action packed must see
Jul 27 2015,positive,one of the best movies i have ever seen stunning visual great soundtracks strong characters and suspense throughout the whole movie
Jul 27 2015,negative,worst remake ever no story hes not the main character he cant think for himself he cant talk but then all of a sudden gets very chatty 2 hour car chase that brings absolutely nothing new another hollywood moneygrab movie for braindead people    also someone please explain to those feminists that the word emperator is masculine shes called an empress unless shes really a transgender that doesnt know talk about femifail    worst movie of 2015 and that includes bollywood
Jul 26 2015,positive,i bumped it up half a star when i found out there are to be two more of them yay    i really liked the movie but i have liked the whole series  what i think i like the best about this one was that it had great graphics yet didnt lose that b movie character that was established in the first three       i keep mentioning the first three but if you arent familiar with the series just read the wikipedia synopsis and youre fine
Jul 26 2015,positive,this has to be the most actionpacked movie i have seen in a long time regarding movies i have seen at the theater after watching the original three of the franchise i have to say this is my favorite mad max to date with the 2nd one falling closely behind the 2nd one may overall a better movie in terms of its themes and the development of max as a character but i definitely enjoy this 2015 release the most    fury road opens with max mentioning he used to be a road warrior an allusion to the second film and we see jolting flashbacks to what seems to be his son dying in a road incident in this post apocalyptic world in this sense the film seems to combine a sequel with a reboot since max lost his family in the first film yet the film does not reference specific moments from the earlier films other than this with the style more focused on the action a fast pace throughout and more modern cinematography i would classify this more as a reboot    this movie has received a lot of hype and while i enjoyed this movie very much i would not be so quick to judge it as one of the greatest action films of all time i may have to see fury road a few times because of this the plot is ridiculously simple at face value one side character even sums it up perfectly by asking all this over a family squabble max is a loner captured by a community that resides at a place called the citadel and he is forced into the middle of a battle instigated by furiosa wanting to bring the leaders several wives to a land of safety when they realize this land doesnt exist anymore they decide to go back to the citadel fighting the warriors of the community who have been pursuing them the whole time thats it    im not sure what to make of tom hardys performance as max the opening voiceover sets the tone of the movie perfectly and the voice hardy uses even makes him sound like mel gibson from the original trilogy we dont get much dialogue from max throughout the film  which is perfectly fine  but his body language seems to only say one thing for a long while mistrust max is so paranoid of furiosa and the women she is protecting at first that he threatens them with an unloaded weapon watches them constantly and disarms them as soon as he gets the chance and actually fires warning shots that end up getting one of them injured his grief is represented by the jolting flashbacks to the death of his son which could have been handled with more subtlety as in the 2nd mad max    other than this what is there to say about the action in the film other than high praise i dont know how he did it but george miller was able to create many wellchoreographed and carefully thoughtout action sequences with little cgi and involving many various vehicles id have to say the best roadbased action ive ever seen takes place in this film    this is one of the best films the first half of 2015 has to offer but it is not a perfect movie if you love action movies then it probably is the perfect movie for you go see this film if you want the experience of a roller coaster
Jul 26 2015,positive,in an age of cgi driven blockbusters its nice to see some good old fashioned killer stunt work coupled with an amazing film production
Jul 26 2015,positive,so stupid yet entertaining
Jul 26 2015,positive,better then original 
Jul 26 2015,negative,this movie was sooooooooooo fing boring i wanted to put a stick of dynamite in mouth and light it absofinglutely zero plot stupid beyond belief and i am very skeptical of rotten tomatoes ratings system since this astonishing piece of turd is still sitting at 98    in retrospect i would have rather had the enjoyment of watching 600 burn than to have spent it on that crap
Jul 26 2015,positive,pretty good while it sticks with its daliesqueness and refrains from trying to make any plot statements  which thankfully it manages for the movies majority
Jul 26 2015,positive,see it see it now what are you waiting for you need to be watching this movie right now
Jul 26 2015,positive,this is my favorite movie of the year guaranteed
Jul 26 2015,negative,worst movie of the year for sure possibly the worst movie of the decade i have seen and enjoyed the previous ones and this one is not about mad max but about charlize theron ok why more importantly it does not develop any of the characters and like i said even having seen the previous movies i had a difficult time understanding what was what and why they did what they did plus car chase scenes are fillers for me when there is a lack of content and this entire movie is one long chase scene that ends up right where they started
Jul 26 2015,negative,looked cool the cars and  fashion designer did a great job thats the only reason im giving it any stars at all this movie could of been alot better if the chase was just a small piece of the movie and if the chase plot was based on another reason one huge long chase scene is just way to much i dont even like driving in a car 5 minutes to the store let alone watch someone drive 2 hours straight in a empty environment the cars and look was amazing but holy crap one long scene of a basic car chase was like nails on a chalkboard about a hour into the movie realized this was going to be another hour of just a car chase and said to myself holy crap is this actually happening one long scene is like going to a gfs parents house to have dinner and realizing you have to stay a hour longer because the gf wont stop talking and you gotta get up for work the next morning
Jul 26 2015,positive,thats one hell of a 3d movie
Jul 25 2015,positive,this was amazing i feared it would not do the old ones justice but it did and i fell in love with this movie in the end i left happy and almost cried tears of joy
Jul 25 2015,positive,in honor of my first review i would like to start off with a movie i truly believe visually and mentally is movie of the year although it has been some time since i viewed this movie i can close my eyes and imagine the whole movie because thats how much it attracted my attention visually the movie is that of a beautiful painting of a desert landscape but still captures the essence of a postapocalyptic wasteland you can tell that everything from the shooting locations to the gritty high octane powered vehicles was chosen and worked on carefully tom hardy did an amazing job as max and truly did mel gibsons performance justice charlize theron was mesmerizing as usual even with a shaved head and amputated arm and nicholas holt really did a 180 from his performance as beast in the prexmen franchise as he plays a drug addicted soldier wanting to prove his loyalty to his legion     as a huge fan of the mad max trilogy i can truly say this movie is rewatchable and i certainly will want to own the dvd it is an art gallery in movie form and i will welcome it into my collection of film whether you are hanging with the bros or having a date night i would say this movie is great for all parties involved
Jul 25 2015,positive,awesome ride throughout  really great
Jul 25 2015,positive,awesome filmvery metal
Jul 25 2015,positive,another great movie from tom hardy
Jul 25 2015,positive,easily in my top 5 favourite movies of all time ive seen this masterpiece 4 times in theater never gets old     the soundtrack cinematography visuals action acting everything is perfect
Jul 25 2015,positive,barbarically awesome
Jul 25 2015,positive,great film best mad max cant wait to watch this with me kids
Jul 25 2015,positive,best use of a guitar player in a movie ever
Jul 24 2015,positive,loved this rollercoaster ride of a movie cant wait for more
Jul 24 2015,positive,at first i was hesitant for this film considering the amount of hype that it had been getting from my friends then i sat down and became a believer  almost the perfect manifestation of an action film this recent mad max franchise installment goes to show that somewhat steady camera work and a wellbuilt read minimal cgi world full of unique characters can leave an audience in awe of its accomplishment thats not to say that a lot of the stuff in this film is weird and crazy but it just fits so well within the story that is being told  other action films take note this is what to shoot for
Jul 24 2015,positive,i wonder how many people saw the true nature of this film an equally brazen and shameless subversion of an once ultramasculine franchise and turning it into a dark and grotesque feminist fairy tale i despise the message but bow down to the craftsmanship its all super crazy and vibrant on the surface but very very cold and measured right beneath it
Jul 24 2015,positive,after some 30 years writer director george miller brilliantly brings back to a new generation of moviegoers his iconic character of mad max which was originally played by mel gibson in a breakout performance that made him an international superstar millers new visually stunning supercharged reboot is a punkinfluenced dystopian vision with an angry feminist streak it is also a nonstop relentless orgy of brutal violence death blood automotive mayhem peppered with collisions and explosions as well as unforgettable adrenalinepumping kinetic action sequences that puts to shame every action blockbuster in recent memory the plot concerns the revenge seeking desert nomad max rockatansky played impressively by tom hardy who skillfully takes over the role from gibson and proves to be a worthy successor max is roped into helping a onearmed steelyeyed badass female protagonist named furiosa played magnificently by charlize theron in a scenestealing performance she has escape with five young women from the clutches of immortan joe a fearsome psychotic warlord who wears a teethbar mask he is chillingly played by hugh keaysbyrne who played the sadistic villain toecutter in the 1979 original mad max joe with his army of murderous gonzo warriors and trickedout vehicles race across the desert he will stop at nothing to recover his female property and is totally hellbent on stopping them masterful direction by george miller exceptional supporting performances by nicholas hoult josh helman nathan joe zoe kravitz rosie huntingwhiteley riley keough abby lee courtney eaton but its charlize therons feminist freedom fighter that surprisingly steals this awesome film dazzling cinematography by john seale with extraordinary razorsharp editing by jason ballantine and margaret sixel the film has breathtaking stunt work a cinematic work of jawdropping imagination and artistic craftsmanship a total masterpiece one of the years best films highly recommended
Jul 24 2015,positive,best visual effects i have seen from ages
Jul 24 2015,positive,if you wanna watch someone else play mario kart watch this but i dont see why u just dont buy a wii u and play mario kart 8 its probably cheaper
Jul 24 2015,positive,cant wait to see if they make another
Jul 24 2015,positive,hands down this will most likely be my favorite film of 2015 mad max is one of those films where it is a genuine shock that not only is it a brilliant film but arguably ranks in the same league as the first two films a amazing action packed film with a lot of heart and actual effort that has and still is sorely missing from film these days see this multiple times at all costs
Jul 24 2015,positive,really great film one of the few movies ever made that is not predictable or cheesy a great mix of action madness and comedy one of the best films ever made
Jul 23 2015,negative,hard to believe with what cgi has to offer how much better the original is  whats unbelievable are the high ratings  pitiful and boring max cannot be saved by a one armed charlize  everything works out so easy its sickening
Jul 23 2015,positive,mad max fury road was a unique mixture of action and suspense with its wide range of colourful characters nux and the keeper of seeds to its intense car chases through the blazing dense desert mad max 4 is truly an astonishing treasure i would recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of chases action adventure or tom hardy
Jul 23 2015,negative,this movie was horrible and stupid how could this get such a high rating
Jul 23 2015,positive,very weird but different enough to make it stand out
Jul 23 2015,positive,im not usually one for movies that are just nonstop action but i wholeheartedly loved fury road its never repetitivesomething new interesting and visually spectacular is always happening the movie is filled to the brim with crazy concepts character and prop design and sets but it never feels like it was stuffed too full while its basically 95 action and has very very little dialogue the acting alone is enough to make it clear to the audience what the characters are feeling in a way that isnt too wordy mad max fury road is a truly amazing movie
Jul 23 2015,negative,if you think metallica is a band of creative geniuses and dylan had nothing to say this is the movie for you sound and fury signifying nothing
Jul 23 2015,negative,ok so you have all the action the fighting the crazy dude with the guitar but that is basically all you have this movie gave me absolutely nothing i do like a good action movie but without any substance these sorts of movies just falls flat for me     did it entertain me of course it did at times but as mentioned its just your shallow go to action movie and i started picturing bane throughout the whole movie     but its a winner with the crowds and i can understand why but its not for everyone
Jul 23 2015,positive,there was no mel gibsonbut it was definitely worth it
Jul 22 2015,positive,the entire movie is one long violent excessively loud breathtakingly beautiful car chase  this is not just a sequel just like roadwarrior wasnt george miller has evolved his world into a freaky extreme
Jul 22 2015,positive,great movie  from beginning to end its action packed and keeps you wanting more  not much dialogue but it fits the movie well
Jul 22 2015,positive,the most visually exhilarating movie i have seen in years fantastic cinematography and excellent acting charlize theron was outstanding
Jul 22 2015,positive,i cant give all stars because i have one issue with this film its small but i gotta point it out i felt betrayed by some of the smaller useages of digital such as near the end when the digital wheel flies towards the screen clearly cashing in on the 3d nature of current cinema it feels disingenuous and tacky for such a relatively grounded campy postapocalyptic cinematic joyride overall it was great regardless of a small niggle
Jul 22 2015,positive,an amazing action film
Jul 22 2015,positive,non stop action that will leave your heart pounding at the end of the movie
Jul 22 2015,positive,after exactly 30 years since the last installment came out george miller comes back to direct the next movie in his beloved series this time we have a new fresh cast and ideas there are two things weve come to expect from a mad max film great action and really crazy people this one takes both off the hook and puts them an a whole other level
Jul 22 2015,positive,its a highoctane remake of mad max 2 and it absolutely works
Jul 22 2015,negative,this really should have been called mad furiosa i like tom hardy but he doesnt speak and hes not the main man hes outdone by the bald one armed chick and loses his iconic car in first 5 mins not good and dont think its fresh but still its pretty to look at
Jul 22 2015,positive,the whole movie is a total madness
Jul 22 2015,positive,interesting movie over the top action and characters but that is the point i think
Jul 22 2015,positive,director george miller presents another postapocalyptic action adventure with fury road the fourth outing in the mad max film series charlize theron stars alongside tom hardy in this amazing action movie set in a future australia desert scenes filmed in namibia africa saw this in 3d 2nd viewing adults only  910 rev 236
Jul 22 2015,negative,the plot dialogue and characterisations were mind numbing and not in a good way sorry didnt do it for me despite the hype
Jul 22 2015,positive,a thrill ride of a movie
Jul 21 2015,positive,the most rewarding experience ive had at the movies in years
Jul 21 2015,positive,to be honest this is better then life
Jul 21 2015,positive,this is what future action directors should look to as the godfather of action cinema and take note of wide takes of breathtaking beautiful destruction 
Jul 21 2015,negative,how can this be getting such good scores  this movie isnt about mad max its about a woman named freakina or something like that   movie still could have worked but was booring
Jul 21 2015,positive,one of the best theater experiences ive ever had even despite going to a gross rundown 2 theater where at one point the exit door flung open during a thunderstorm thats how engrossing the film was
Jul 21 2015,negative,im no longer surprised when bad movies are nominated for best film by the academy but i cant fathom how fury road got away with a 97 rating on rotten tomatoes this movie was acclaimed for its narrative which i felt was scattershot at best to me the narrative felt more like a 2hour old spice commercial spliced with footage from an upcoming twisted metal video game and as visually rewarding as this movie was i felt the audio editing actually became a liability as the music and sound effects kept drowning out dialogue    to each their own for me this was not my cup of tea im shocked it was for so many people
Jul 21 2015,positive,two hour hold your breath fun ride with absolultley no plot and the best performances were at the very end by the old lady bikers
Jul 21 2015,positive,lured in by the surprisingly stellar reviews and a dash of tarnished nostalgia for the first and second not third max universe i found myself loving virtually every minute of this kickass ballet of violence fused with a story of love honor and character thats right the nearly mute heroes played by theron and hardy lend their hardwon survival skills to the rescue of two bands of women  the first one serving essentially as brood mares for the evil bad guy of the film the second an abandoned group of amazonian warriors all the actors are excellent but i especially liked nicholas hoults whitefaced havenekkid true believer punk motorhead inhabitation this is an insanely ampedup visual movie with more sightgags and visual story elements in a minute than you normally get in a full scene indeed there is nary a minute wasted on exposition somehow through a combination of the visuals the action and economical dialog the audience jumps on for the ride everything is clear and there are high stakes a perfect summer popcorn movie a genre which has in recent years become for me more of an epithet than its original meaning a wellmade movie that uses movie conventions as shorthand for telling stories that matter to audiences
Jul 21 2015,positive,amazing very well done its very hard to do a remake and still hold true to the fundamentals of what the original was trying to project to the audience this movie does a great job of that but with a new plot the new plot reinvigorates the original theme of post apocalyptic world where the those who possess the elements rule the world the special effects are some of the best done in years the hue in the movie alone drawls you in
Jul 21 2015,positive,i saw this movie twice in theatres and still cant wait to see it again the redemption of furiosa should be the secondary title
Jul 21 2015,positive,best action film for years visually breathtaking stunts and effects with real weight and heft  cgi sparing and unobtrusive dialogue minimal but effective acting as naturalistic as possible under the circumstances  except nick hoult who displays more character and animation than in his every other performance put together almost touching if there were any justice miller would get the oscar for directing a new standard for every action movie to follow the matrix de nous jours
Jul 21 2015,positive,just incredible acting excellent the script exactly what it should be kept to a minimum little dialogue not much characterbuilding and the action sequences were sensational but more than that fury road was the most visually stunning film i have ever seen  more so than jurassic park avatar or revenge of the sith
Jul 21 2015,positive,if you like post apocalyptic action film this is possibly the best i have seen since 1979s mad max original
Jul 21 2015,positive,amazingjust amazing incorporating from other previous films of mad max this rendition is clearly an extension of what george miller intended when he first came up with the concept truly a cinema marvel
Jul 20 2015,negative,if i could give it more negative rating i would    as a fan of the timeless trilogy this should not have been remade especially if they were going to rework the character of max who was a selfsufficient survivalist and main character    this movie would have been better served and a much higher rating and review given if george miller had based it on a female character similar to max and possibly involving another mfp cop who becomes her sidekick    this seems to be an attempt by george miller to reboot his career using the material that made him a success
Jul 20 2015,positive,one star just for the style
Jul 20 2015,negative,this was the worst movie i have seen in a long time  if you are looking for a 2 hour car chase with little dialogue this is your movie
Jul 20 2015,positive,such a badass movie
Jul 20 2015,positive,this is the best film ive seen since the 2000  one of my all time favorite for sure
Jul 20 2015,positive,they still make great movies phenomenal
Jul 20 2015,positive,adrenaline from the beginning never give us space to take cheappopcorn awesome 2 hrs seems so quick nice job george

Jul 20 2015,positive,this film in jurassic world are like twins for me ok movies with awesome special effects if thats what you like go see it i would have waited for the dvd
Jul 19 2015,negative,i have no idea how this was so highly rated is america that easily amused with things blowing up and lack or story line
Jul 19 2015,positive,filled with gratifying violence fascinating characters and a hunger to entertain hilariously masochistic and surprisingly emotional see it
Jul 19 2015,positive,just the best of the year
Jul 19 2015,positive,incredible just absolutely incredible
Jul 19 2015,neutral,spoiler alert theres a bunch of angry driving some people are good and others are bad and they all drive angrily for two hours
Jul 19 2015,positive,eciting action movie
Jul 19 2015,positive,such an brilliant breathtaking crazy ride
Jul 19 2015,positive,cant even stop breathing charlize theron deserves oscars
Jul 19 2015,positive,great film but beyond thunderdome still my favorite one out of the series
Jul 19 2015,positive,george miller does it again delivering another chapter in an amazing saga  definitely recommend
Jul 19 2015,positive,gritty grungy dirty fun
Jul 19 2015,positive,saw this action packed movie well done and story was good
Jul 19 2015,positive,v8 v8 v8  fly me to the valhalla witness me
Jul 19 2015,positive,i was on the edge of my seat the entire movie
Jul 19 2015,negative,there was literally a 30 minute scene of the characters driving and fighting while playing guitar why and it was so boring at this point you dont even know what is going on and who the characters are you could literally leave the theater for a half an hour and not miss anything i walked out so maybe it gets better i dont know but i wouldnt waste the money
Jul 19 2015,positive,best movie of the year 2015 so far for me  all i can say if you want to be entertained by a beautifully shot movieis you must see this in the theaters  it is a roller coaster ride that doesnt stop and every single frame seems to have been so artfully constructed  you truly feel you are watching exactly what george miller wants you to see of his vision in every frame  charlize theron and tom hardys performances are just right in what could be taken as an overthetop film but given the world of mad max this is the perfect exhiliarting thrill ride that wants you to walk out of the theater goingwow if not speechless 
Jul 19 2015,positive,action packed from the first scene
Jul 19 2015,positive,spectacular brutal and inspiring
Jul 19 2015,positive,so far my favorite movie the only problem was it was kind of confusing of what was going on and where they were going besides that this movie is spot on
Jul 19 2015,negative,the only reason im giving this more than one star is because the filmography was pretty good other than that and the special effects um where was the story
Jul 19 2015,positive,easily the best movie of the year my one of the top ten movies i havent got bored watching it again and again action packed story driven full of excitement
Jul 18 2015,positive,one big badass action scene
Jul 18 2015,positive,by far my favorite movie of the year maybe the best ive seen these past 3 or 2 years in my opinion charlize theron was the star of the movie but tom hardy also was amazing
Jul 18 2015,positive,best movie this year action packed from beginning to end never got boring the models with dirt on them was a bit cheesy but everything else was great i love hardy and theron was really good the effects were just top notch
Jul 18 2015,positive,the creativity detail and effort of the chase sequences and visuals will make up for lack of plot or character development
Jul 18 2015,negative,just one big chase scene  repetitive at 2h long
Jul 18 2015,positive,ball slapping insanity and i loved every minute of it
Jul 18 2015,neutral,ok so the special effects were great but all the mad max films since the 2 in the original series mad max  thunder road have suffered by being lame attempts to repeat that success
Jul 18 2015,positive,not the best mad max film but it definitely feels like one
Jul 18 2015,positive,âmy name is max my world is reduced to a single instinct survive as the world fell it was hard to know who was more crazy me or everyone elseâ     as you can see madness is at an epidemic stage and if you go into mad max fury road expecting anything other than fullon madness then you sir will tremble at the sight of the desolate orange landscape filled with baldheaded powdered men normallooking models and one very lonely fearsome man with no cause in life but to surviveâ and yes he may not be as mad as some of the creatures in this barren backdrop but he is downright bonkers in his bravery and his name is max     30 years ago the original mad max trilogy starring mel gibson in the title role ended so did it the hopes of the australian new wave and the career of its director george miller who hasnât recaptured his initial personal success but in 2015 the mad max franchise has been brought back into existence and the only thing connecting both franchises other than the character max is the creator miller himself this is the way to do it no film gets rebooted 30 years later with its creator still at the fore of proceedings mad max as a film manages to keep the heart of the originals but george millerâs intelligence is that he doesnât allow the film to get stuck in time failing to make use of its new audience he instead brings it up to date so fans of originals and audienceâs of today will all flock to the cinema to see what has become of this breeding ground of insanity upon first viewing i think it is safe to say especially in this era of evergrowing franchises that there is a future for mad max or better yet we want this madness to return     maxâs world may be fire it may be blood but he has never come across such powdery men in his fourth outing set in a future desert wasteland where supplies such as gasoline and water are scarcities and only the most fierce deranged people are able to collect the most the tyrannical cult leader of the citadel immortan joe sends imperator furiosa and a bunch of his white war boys to collect gasoline on a heavily fortified oil rig but as furiosa drives significantly off route joe sends his entire army and himself in pursuit of her one of joeâs war boys nux uses max as a universal blood donor and as he attempts to take down furiosa himself max joins forces with her and a lengthy car chase ensues in which blood fire mud and a literal hurricane sandstorm shake proceedings up     mad max fury road is one big long fat redemptive helluva crosscountry chase that willingly turns into two rounds where the goodies and baddies attempt to cross the barren desert landscape in such a toxically insane fashion audienceâs will start rejoicing for two reasons 1 because the mad max fury road experience was ballistic and 2 our worldâs evil is a miniscule pinch compare to these rabid folks the road rage puts fast  furious 6âs endless runway chase to shame ten times over the action is so original and so overthetop that it proves an action film can live off of its stunts all this madness occurs whilst moving and that is the best part of it because everything moves there is such an unexpectedness to the action and that is saying tonnes coming from action films of today that sitting back and expecting literally anything is the only way to watch it mad max fury road is a heck of a film that makes action films of yesteryear appear lacklustre and the action blockbusters of today look like they wet themselves trying to make even a fraction of the action mad max throws at us a tiny bit decent mad max fury road has set a benchmark for future action films and the only reason it has set a benchmark is because it is as if this is the first action film weâve seen     interwoven within the pandemonium of action is an unrelenting dosage of preposterousness that makes mad max as a package a riproaring spectacle of unyielding madness it is a combination of bizarreness with more bizarreness which alongside the electric action and thoughtful storyline simply elevates the mad max fury road experience to ridiculous levels from the gory deaths let me say not as bad as the original trilogy to the no nonsense cars a mirage of goodlooking women and a nutcase playing electric guitar on top of a car during the road rage emphasises mad max as not only original but simply bonkers entertainment thanks to the impatient storyline the marathon car chase allows for angles cameras never knew existed before or perhaps felt no need to go there making mad max unique on the eye as well to sum up the action mad max fury road is a visual explosion of insanity that does what it says on the tin of course for some this penetration of madness can be over the top but you came to watch âmadâ maxâ what on earth did you expect     imagine a 59yearold mel gibson jumping off of cars during a hurricaneâ yeah sorry mel it was never going to happen ever but tom hardy is possibly the best actor out there that fitted the raggedy and fierce max rockatansky and thank god he got the role his presence never goes unnoticed for his quietly eerie attitude adds a profundity to max that wasnât there in gibsonâs performance one thing though he does on occasion sound like a robot but that takes nothing away from a great performance charlize theronâs portrayal of imperator furiosa threatens to steal the limelight away from hardy her shaved head bionic arm and ruthless fighting skills and attitude just make furiosa such a badass character possibly the best supporting character in the mad max universe nicholas houltâs nux is a revelation for his bonkers attitude is one that brings a dimension of fun to the action hoult may be the romantic englishboy but this performance of a crazed war boy along with the hairy blue mutant beast sees houltâs career in ascension and hugh keaysbyrne returns to mad max as immortan joe again as the evil leader with such ferocity that he creates a worthy foe to max     where the success truly lies with this film is the narrative there is not much talking but the resonance of the taleâs importance is truly felt the longwinded chase allows for character development both from the good and bad side they may not talk much but you can feel how they feel because the acting is so raw after all the action and dirt accumulated in the desert heat the accomplishment at the end of the film feels so satisfying the richness of the script despite it lacking much talking gives the words that are said extra magnitude you could pluck any sentence out even during the moments of bamboozling action and its richness in emphasising the story and the world behind it including mel gibsonâs mad max history is fantastic not only that but some lines are just cool period how about this âwhat do you suppose heâs gonna do â retaliate firstâ or simply âhope is a mistakeâ mad max fury road may be rich in action but its narrative resonance allows the action to go on for so long because what is said actually has a sense of gravitas and that gravitas makes this rebooting of mad max more than worthwhile     after witnessing the hell on earth that is mad max fury road preferably in cinemas youâll all be on what nux is on because this film has made your day better than before it entered it     âoh what a day what a lovely dayâ     such a barrage of action mayhem has set mad max fury road on course to attaining legendary action status not to mention the fact that george miller has instilled new life into his revolutionary series     ââââââââââ     910
Jul 18 2015,positive,one of the best action movies ive seen in a long time it is completely over the top but thats the point always entertaining and very original strong performances from tom hardy and charlize theron as well
Jul 18 2015,positive,dear michael bay and zack snyder    theres this film playing currently called mad max fury road i strongly suggest you go see it    much like your films fury road consists of a considerable amount of intense fighting gun battles and explosions except it contains less stupid dialogue more meaningful characters even though max says about eleven sentences in the whole film and is shot in a more comprehensible coherent way oh and by the way it has 10x more action than your films and yet it made me jump with joy while your films have made me want to call 911 because i thought i was about to suffer a stroke    the entire story of fury road can be summed up in one sentence set in a postnuclear war earth max and a few others try to drive a giant tank of gasoline to the green place while a group of gangsters chases them the entire 2 hour run time consists of that chase    no joke the whole movie is one freaking long chase in one desert    but while this may seem like an exhaustive way to spend 2 hours in giant dark room with a bunch of strangers all of whom are wearing funny plastic glasses because it makes the screen look less blurry  and perhaps if it were made by you mr bay it very well might have been an exhaustive experience  but in this case it isnt in fact its precisely the opposite    you see mr bay a 70yearold australian medical doctor named george miller has made an action film thats all action from start to finish and is absolutely magnificent so magnificent in fact that i had shivers watching a shot where max is riding inside a dust storm as a bunch of the villains henchmen are blowing into a giant vortex of thunder and lightning    its genuinely stunning    all of this is done through stylistic consistency across the editing the strangely appropriate fastmotion presentation images perfectly in sync with the sound and music i could go on and on but itd be better if you go see it for yourself    oh what a film what a lovely film
Jul 18 2015,negative,boring as heck id rather watch a couple bees fight for 2 hours
Jul 18 2015,positive,great movie strong visuals action and acting good
Jul 18 2015,positive,interesting twist on an old classic i liked it and would definitely added to my collection
Jul 18 2015,positive,well it was good but not that good im sorry im not even impressed by the acting of one of my all time favourites charlize theron oh but tom hardy sure is an eye candy so now we know that im not a mad max fan
Jul 17 2015,positive,theres a reason the american western is so popular and mad max fury road steps up the genre ten notches    mad max fury road is an apocalyptic cinema masterpiece and george miller has written and conducted it flawlessly  not only does miller follow the vengeance and redemption formula but also does it masterfully  this movie could have easily been as disastrous as mad max beyond thunderdome   given the fact that its been a screenplay for almost 15 years miller has had plenty of time to polish this gem and not repeat that raggedy man crap    max rockatansky our protagonist tom hardy again finds himself alone and fighting with the nightmares of his past and struggling with the loss of his wife and son  max is caught and imprisoned by an evil cult leader named immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne who leads an army called the war boys  immortan joe has a lieutenant named imperator furiousa charlize theron shes sent out into the wasteland to collect the go juice gasoline but has smuggled immortan joes five breeder wives out with her inside the tanker  the formula for mmfr is the same as the past three mad max films maybe not the silly beyond thunderdome debacle as much but its much more than car battles battle cages wrist crossbow shots to the face and cool gruesome ways to fall under the path of trucks and tanks  once our heroes are on their youll see the parallels between max and furiousa once shes reached her clan and is given some pretty horrific news about the green place that used to be her home    at the end of our western we see max leaving what would be a new beginning for him but his angst pulls him away as he struggles with the guilt of not saving his own family  max will continue to be alone because allowing himself to settle down and start anew would be a sin  the torture of being alone is his penance for his wife and son  max does leave part of himself behind before he leaves  ill let you figure that out when you see the movie  its a brilliant yet subtle act that ensures the growth and prosperity of the clan  its also interesting to note that millers script passes the bechdel test  this denotes a movie that has two named women who talk to each other about something other than a man  its the first western worth mentioning including star wars that has done that   watch mad max fury road
Jul 17 2015,positive,a little long slow at times but i was still entertained by it  the electric guitar player on the war vehicle was a nice touch and i liked the humor of it  mad max was refreshing because it didnt have a free will forgiveness antigovernment antitax antimuslim antiatheist threads running through it  the oppression of women theme was in step with todays problems
Jul 17 2015,positive,one of the best films of 2015 this is the 80s action film that didnt come out in the 80s
Jul 17 2015,positive,great character study
Jul 17 2015,positive,as a good as an action movie can get
Jul 17 2015,positive,it was awesome i wouldnt mind watching it more than once
Jul 17 2015,positive,fantastic movie never lets up throughout 100mph and proud of it one of the best films of the year
Jul 17 2015,positive,lives up to the original series loved it
Jul 17 2015,positive,good as a straight ahead action film but the changing framerate makes it difficult to watch distracting and taking you out of the film
Jul 17 2015,negative,way to fucked up for my liking
Jul 16 2015,positive,this might be a new addition to my alltime top 5
Jul 16 2015,positive,it was ok i liked the original one better with mel gibson
Jul 16 2015,positive,mad max fury road is my favorite movie of 2015 and its one of the best action movies ive ever seen the action sequences in this movie are incredible the acting is amazing and the direction and stunts are mind blowing
Jul 16 2015,positive,now this is how you do an action movie thought provoking short on needless exposition and featuring stunning practical effects puts other films in the genre to shame and its doubtful we will get one better for quite some time
Jul 16 2015,positive,the action never really slows the movie is fast paced from beginning to end the effects are beautiful it would be nice to get a little more characterization but honestly in a movie like this it isnt really necessary this is a very fun movie with some really smart themes doesnt hurt that there are some great death scenes
Jul 16 2015,positive,pretty damn good what the hell was mad doing
Jul 16 2015,positive,one of the best action films i have seen in years well shot well choreographed heavy use of practical effects and very little cgi no shakeycam near flawless film
Jul 16 2015,positive,splendid indeed thats what you expect from a george miller alep july 2015
Jul 16 2015,positive,max rockatansky you know hope is a mistake if you cant fix whats broken youll go insane    one must give george miller a hand for this film this film is quite the spectacle a film for action junkies and critics alike the direction in this film is quite outstanding almost like a symphony the plot while not amazing is made in to so much more containing many feminist messages under george millers direction the characters may not utter much but it is their actions and gestures that really develop their characters and that is a difficult task for any actor charlize theron delivers one of the better performances of her career and even earns some early oscar consideration this film does not let down under the beautiful direction of george miller and outstanding performances from the cast it is difficult to not only revive a franchise but make its most outstanding entry to date and set up for future films george miller shows how sequels are supposed to be made and that he is one of cinemas better directors looking forward to more from him
Jul 16 2015,positive,to summarize this movie in one word it would have to be crazy doesnt let up from beginning to end and i left the theater wondering what marvelous madness i had just witnessed
Jul 16 2015,positive,this was just a great movie
Jul 16 2015,negative,boring boring boring i know one must suspend your disbelief when watching films like this but how were they able to drive forever and not once stop to gas up the cars and trucks for all the talk of this being a feminist movie why was there a scene that looked straight out of a beer ad with a wet tshirt contest this was an absolutely ridiculous movie  i dont get why so many people just loved it
Jul 16 2015,positive,exceptional one hell of a ride
Jul 15 2015,negative,wasnt fussed on this seemed to be pretty much of the same thing all the way through
Jul 15 2015,positive,kind of silly and really weird but i guess i liked it
Jul 15 2015,positive,a bit overrated but still a good throwback to the apocalyptic westerns of the eighties
Jul 15 2015,positive,in the same world where fast and furious gets seven instalments its extremely safe to say that this fury road is more than welcome an absolute pleasure to be immersed in george millers wild wasteland because the man has been gifted with a rather vivid imagination and this twohour long car chase is evidence of that its only a bit of a shame that not many nonwhite folk seem to have survived the end of this particular world but at least feminists can find a pal in miller  i love that his wife is the films editor and that the vagina monologues author was a consultant on set fury road also gets extra props for not wasting its 3d conversion theres nothing better than mechanical parts and postapocalyptic survivors flying over ones face if someone told you this is the best blockbuster of recent times they werent kidding it really is word on the street is there may be at least three more sequels coming yes please always a plus to watch blood being washed off with mothers milk in a multiplex reboot
Jul 15 2015,positive,super awesome flick
Jul 15 2015,positive,an exhilarating thirstmaking beast of a road movie  miller has taken the source material and nitrocharged the action more surprising is that the plot has depth not that theres much time to explore the post  apocalyptic world hes created throw in some seriously strong female lead characters and this is one of the most refreshing blockbusters ive seen in years
Jul 15 2015,positive,unique weird fucked up awesome action 
Jul 15 2015,neutral,a bunch of wakos fighting in the desert
Jul 15 2015,positive,non stop and just plain trippy dont think too much just get on and go for the ride of your life
Jul 15 2015,positive,mad max fury road is the new king of action movies its awesome
Jul 15 2015,positive,i like hot chicks and amputees i also like a good car chase and a few good deaths i really liked this movie and on a side note im moving to la mostly for the hot chicks car chases  deaths but also for the amputees
Jul 15 2015,positive,great action movie but the action does get repetitive  since its always while driving
Jul 15 2015,positive,the best movie i have ever saw in theatre so far
Jul 15 2015,positive,assigned to drive a massive truck to collect gasoline furiosa charlize theron has another plan once there is a good distance between the vehicle and her starting point she would veer offtrack and return to her homelandalong with five wives of cult leader immortan joe hugh keaysbyryne a hot pursuit erupts with ailing nux nicholas hoult chained to a prisoner named max tom hardy hoping to impress immortan joe so he can be welcomed to valhalla when he dies    mad max fury road directed by george miller is an orgasmic visual exercise of yelloworange sand sweltering heat vehicle acrobatics dramatic explosions and deformed heavy makeupwearing citizens of a collapsed world bound by no rules even without a deep story it engages thoroughly because the images are so hyperbolic there is not one film that is remotely like it in the past decade    the action scenes are inspired and creative the picture is composed of one long chase sequence but there is variety in the counters between heroesheroines and villains with each geographic change we get an idea about the group of people who live within that area particularly memorable is the biker gang waiting atop a narrow canyon a deal has been made between the gang and furiosa based on how the scene is shot as our protagonists enter the canyon we know immediately that something is about to go wrong    such is the films strength it is shot with a sense of urgency although the narration in the beginning briefly describes the circumstances that led to humanitys decay we remain curious about its universe nonetheless because it does not spell out every detail as the characters trek across dry terrains we discover the journey with them for instance the challenge is not only avoiding or eliminating those who try to kill them all characters must also be wary of and be prepared for the cruel environment that awaits    at times the picture attempts to do too much a romantic connection is introduced eventually which does not work at all the problem is we have a basic understanding about only half of the wouldbe couple character depth and development is not one of the films strengths and so such a desperate attempt to get us emotionally involved through a romantic scope comes across as forced and unnecessary sometimes less is more    the two leads hardy and theron and two supporting actors hoult and keaysbyrne are a joy to watch because they are unafraid to exaggerate their emotions to look unattractive physically to embody their deranged characters completely each one commands a high level of creative energy and so he or she is front and center there is a magnetism and charisma to the performance we are inspired to learn more about each one of these characters and yet the material has a way of always keeping us at arms length perhaps we are not meant to get to know these people for their world is so different than ours they might as well have been of a different species    written by george miller brendan mccarthy and nick lathouris mad max fury road is a visual spectacle but there is room for some improvement as mentioned previously i see potential as a modern franchiseone that is not about superheroes or chosen ones destined to save a dystopian world but one that is about a decaying world and the degenerates who are struggling to survive in it    filmrevieworg
Jul 15 2015,positive,great effects  action held my attention throughout

Jul 14 2015,positive,literally epicand so unique  i was on the edge of my seat for two whole hours  it was just amazing in every way  kind of a guy movie but unlikely that this one will fall short of anyones expectations
Jul 14 2015,negative,no real plot but good action
Jul 14 2015,positive,twas a nice reprieve from the stereotypical action flick although i felt it less then sensible in its plot  even if that was the point i was a little baffled by the lack of storyline opposing the full on brute action that mad max presents   all in all twas a nice film
Jul 14 2015,positive,the best action thriller ive seen in years strap in
Jul 14 2015,positive,full actionno big history behind

Jul 14 2015,positive,excellent action packed movie
Jul 14 2015,positive,looks great sounds great is great really great
Jul 14 2015,positive,great comeback for george miller but the story is a little weak
Jul 14 2015,positive,mad max fury road becomes so far one of the best films of the year  it unleashes mad imagination talented actors and eyepopping effects by storm
Jul 14 2015,positive,the most actionpacked movie i have seen and i really enjoy action movies with big sound and visual effects  mad max has definitely fulfil that craving there is no pause the whole film is just one big adrenaline ride mad max is a bit of a sidekick here though i will need to watch this again best watch it on the big screen
Jul 14 2015,positive,i went into this movie with high expectations but i couldnt help feel disappointed with the almost nonexistent story and hollow characters yes the action is great but i just got extremely bored at one point and went off to watch ted
Jul 13 2015,negative,driving scenes were good and that is about it the story was complete garbage and the world the movie makes doesnt seem believable at all i think this was rated high by so many reviewers if you can call them that is because so many movies lately were complete sht 
Jul 13 2015,negative,mad max has been neutered   its pretty obvious after watching this new mad max film that it isnt really a mad max film at all this film is somewhat of a kick in the balls to max fans and the character himself in fact it seems like george miller has sacrifice the iconic 80s hero that he created and mel gibson brought to life to the feminist movement thats currently on the roll in the us and hollywood why would he do that my first guess would be money its no secret that miller had been trying to get his latest max film going for years a good chunk of the problem was financial as it is with every film that isnt 100 produced by the major studios after years of trying get the finances together a group probably came along that had a feminist agenda and agree to the amount he needed but only if he played by their rules and made major adjustments to the story most of those adjustments was turning the max character into the second banana and having the story dominated by a female max which is what furiosa isa female mad max she calls the shots she barks the orders shes leading them to freedom and max is her gyro pilot oh there are a few scenes where max takes his balls out of furiosas purse for a few seconds but trust me its like a dog being let off his leash knowing in a very short time he will be leashed again even the posters and the blu ray covers reveal the true intent of the film maxs face in the background muzzled while furiosa face is front and center how many films do you see with the supposed main titled character as  background fodder in the promo materialdoesnt happen folks   of course why miller would do this is all speculation on my part but i really cant see any other reason why someone would throw their own created character under the bus other then for a shit load of cash whatever the reason its obvious he did it and he did it by using the ol slight of hand trick in one hand he created so much action and chaos in the movie that your attention was drawn to that the whole film is basically the end chase scene from the road warrior but pumped up 4x while in his other hand he cleverly spun the feminist story line while snipping his characters balls and dignityyes its true mad max has been neutered and a sad sad day for a iconic action hero character indeed i for one will not be seeing any of the sequels if they happened to get made seeing one of the greatest action character in movie history being pissed on once was enough for me
Jul 13 2015,positive,maybe the best movie in 2015
Jul 13 2015,positive,mad max fury road looks amazing with fantastic cinematography and some beautiful imagery and the action is spectacular as it is for once executed properly with good camera movements its accompanied with excellent score and sound effects and it has deadly consequences thus making it exciting and genuinely entertaining which is so commendable as it is so rarely realized as well although the themes never get properly explored and just become overtones the story is incredibly weak and the characters are so underdeveloped this movie is still one of the best action films as it has excellent performances positively crazy characters and humor remarkable worldbuilding some incredibly powerful and memorable moments and one of the best female action heroes of all time
Jul 13 2015,neutral,cgi acting and action scenes were very good and creative it lacked a plot and character development in the movie just thought the movie wasnt as great as critics say with a better plot the movie could have been great
Jul 13 2015,negative,id have to say a big meh on this one nothing to rave about but nothing awful either acting is solid  despite the lack of dialogue i appreciated the feminist undertones but found the story pretty mundane and the plot unconvincing
Jul 13 2015,negative,only stunts no story not really
Jul 13 2015,positive,9010  this movie is all kinds of awesome its a 2 hour chase scene with all sorts of insane action and cinematography the post apocalyptic dystopian wasteland that is the setting is pretty badass and of course tom and charlize kill it as usual
Jul 13 2015,positive,heck yeah    yup thats all ive got to say this had me the whole way through

Jul 12 2015,positive,20150712web hd amazing visual effects and design
Jul 12 2015,positive,okay so this is why i hate getting personal reviews from other people before seeing a movie like this eeeeveryone kept telling me how legendary this movie was after finishing it myself all that i could think was it wasnt great but was still a really good movie i found it incredible how they managed to have such success with making an action packed film with its brief stints of heartfelt moments ohand charlize thereon kicks a my overall rating 86
Jul 12 2015,neutral,looked awesome with insane images but with completely uninteresting characters horrible dialogue and a boring first hour this is not the movie i hoped it would be saved by a good finale though
Jul 12 2015,positive,basically a 2 hour car chase easy the most metal film of 2015 the film has a guy that plays a guitar that shoots fire how fking metal is that madmaxfuryroadconfirmedheavyfkingmetal
Jul 12 2015,positive,best movie of any genre i have seen in a very long time a wild ride and great visuals that were just amazing highly highly recommended im not even a mad max fan didnt even see the other movies they are irrelevant to this one this is postapocalyptic at its best wonderful acting except for tom hardy who nearly ruins it when he tells us his name towards the end i felt like saying who cares this isnt even your story  awesome characters awesome story insanely conceived of and brilliantly made
Jul 11 2015,negative,a half star is also not worth this junk do not waste your time or money on this crappy movie
Jul 11 2015,positive,do not get addicted to the water
Jul 11 2015,positive,the best movie so far this summer
Jul 11 2015,positive,loved it the roughness the feminism the fighting the effects probably the best movie ive seen so far this year
Jul 11 2015,positive,the most action packed and emotionally charged movie with little dialog also less time on building the story line
Jul 11 2015,positive,i think this is one of those movies that will divide the nation everyone ive spoken with about it either loves it as one of the best action movies of all time or hates it as one of the worst reboots and a black eye to the mad max universe i am of the former my husband is of the latter ill give you both opinions  i thought tom hardy was a spectacular mad max he brought a feral intensity to the reboot that fit perfectly in this fantastical postapocalyptic society it was over the top in a good way some say he was too crazy for mad max and he lost his humanity and relatability along the way he became just another crazy ptsd sufferer  charlize theron as furiosa was strong a bit mad herself and definitely wasnt your typical damsel in distress or sexy side kick she was a standalone lead that extended beyond her cup size some thought this character detracted from the max part of the mad max universe thats a fair point  max seemed to take more of a backseat in this story and was definitely not the primary focus he was more of a bystander in someone elses story assisting along the way i was okay with this but im not as much of a mad max buff as others i saw this as a more honest glimpse into the travels of mad max stumbling into others stories for a moment and less of a maxfocused saga  i thought the return of mad max veteran hugh keaysbyrne originally toecutter as immortan joe was a fun little easter egg that showed the progression of time and distanced itself from the mel gibson mad max his citadel stronghold was again over the top he created a religion around himself and you have to join his cult if you ever want his water i didnt have trouble with this premise but others did how did he build his well how did he get so many people under his thumb so quickly valid questions that i dont bother to ask myself but it ruined the suspension of disbelief for others  nux played by nicholas hoult was my favorite character hands down he brought the perfect amount of insanity character development and humor to this actionpacked movie oh what a lovely day indeed nux others were less impressed with the character but he was pretty funny  i absolutely loved that this was basically a twohourlong oversized car chase all the vehicles including the war rig were impressive to behold my favorite and the crowds would be the doof wagon aka the speakermobile the concept of the doof wagon and its flamethrowing guitarsoloing doof warrior is probably the coolest most testosteronedriven thing ever invented i feel like i grew chest hair just watching that thing speed down the road i thought it was a great way to update age old war drums into something totally appropriate for such a fantasy postapocalyptic world others thought it was insanely stupid and that guy should be deaf at the bare minimum if the speakers are pumping the music out loud enough to be heard over all the car engines i liked how insane and out of this world all the vehicles were a freaking merlin with tank treads it lent the story more of a comic book feel this coupled with the cinematography made the movie for me the classic quick zooms onto the drivers faces was very comic book like add to that the sugar on top that was the amount of practical effects and live stunts and youve stolen my heart it was almost everything a girl could ask for in an action movie others were nonplussed by the art style and saw how utterly inefficient and unbelievable such resourcewasting gasguzzling machines are in the setting and why make exploding harpoons instead of more guns again fair points but im not a fan concerned with realism in this fake world  i just want to see more car chases and explosions  finally i have to concede that the plot itself is very disjointed and thin it couldve used a lot more fleshing out and a lot more continuity thus half a star has been deducted from my rating the general concept was there save the wives by getting them to your magical lady utopia utopia doesnt exist so go back and take the citadel but the story seemed like an afterthought as if all the cool stuff like the cars and the setting were in place and someone at the story board said wait shouldnt there be like a story or whatever on this story board and poof someone tacked a postit that said save hot chix bruh and called it a day perhaps thats why there is no romantic undertones in max and furiosas friendship either way i really appreciated the platonic direction it was so refreshing to see a big action movie where the male and female leads dont magically fall in love they were wary allies who grew to respect each other as strong survivors until they parted ways thank you for that   tldr if you take the mad max universe seriously or are an oldschool mm fanboy theres a decent chance you will not enjoy this movie if you just want two hours of cars explosions tom hardy grunting like a feral animal and doof wagon awesomeness then i dont see how you couldnt enjoy this film
Jul 11 2015,positive,insane violence no real plot poor acting and yes i liked it im a guy lots of action
Jul 11 2015,positive,awesome film reminded me of sin city i love the whole visual style and language of the film and that its fairly unique and original or at least rare proper action movie fantastic feast for the eyes i hope theres a sequel
Jul 11 2015,positive,dear jesus please let this really be the future of humanitycause its awesome i dream of the day that i can play flame guitar while wearing a gimp mask
Jul 11 2015,positive,watchable but only just
Jul 11 2015,positive,having the only other george millar film ive seen be happy feet i film i didnt care for much at all and having never seen the other mad max films i had no idea what was in store when i saw this fortunately this movie does everything its promised and then some the cast is amazing the direction is impeccable and the action is out of this world some of the best action ive seen in a film in a long time i love the characters especially nux because he had some of the best character moments throughout the film and furiosa who is one of the strongest female characters there is right now while she is probably the strongest of them there is a cast of woman who all are strong and do a great job in this film tom hardy is great even though he doesnt even speak that much proving he has an even bigger carer ahead of him everything in this movie works and you couldnt ask for more if you tried easily one of the best action films this year and in a while if your a big mad max fan like my dad who absolutely loved this movie then you will definitely love it if your a big fan of actions movies youll definitely love it its a must see one of the best films of 2015 and an action masterpiece
Jul 11 2015,positive,nonstop action loved it
Jul 11 2015,positive,in your face tense action that doesnt stop the movie manages to build a story and characters while doing it too
Jul 11 2015,positive,the action movie of the year and possibly the decade i loved every minute of this fast paced story it is loud exhilarating and all around a shot of adrenaline must see by anyone who loves the actionadventure genre
Jul 11 2015,positive,amazing scenery not so much for storyline
Jul 10 2015,positive,visually striking riveting and surprisingly thoughtful
Jul 10 2015,positive,this is probably one of the best movies ive ever seen and im not usually the action movie type the storytelling with its gorgeous visuals and small amount of verbal communication was amazing i loved how it challenged the need for words in movies  the story was told so beautifully without them and that was a refreshing change from a slew of movies that tell everything through dialogue i also loved the uniqueness of the saturated color postapocalyptic films tend to be greyed out and dismal so emphasizing brilliant colors of the desert was an interesting visual choice and then there was the story itself  it was so well crafted and powerful i went in expecting an action movie though an excellent one from what i had heard and left the theater with the powerful messages about humanity and redemption still running through my head the world of the film is so wellcrafted and the story so powerful that it moved me to tears and made me want to watch it over and over again dont even get me started on the film score  i could go on for days about how well the music was written to add to each and every scene all in all this film was fantastic i was literally speechless when it was over and i can safely say that its one of my favorite movies of all time
Jul 10 2015,positive,fun flick exhausting wanted a wee bit more of a plot very video gameish which isnt necessarily a bad thing
Jul 10 2015,positive,my perfect movie its everything i could ask for in a story
Jul 10 2015,negative,somewhat cool visuals very repetitive chasefight scenes extremely mediocre plot tries to be prowomen but sexualizes them to an extreme for the ones on screen longest or kills them off quickly
Jul 10 2015,positive,this takes me back to the first mad max movie with mel gibson and all the others this one was a good mad max out of all the series the first one i loved and then it just kept getting better at the time that i was a kid to myself i went to see this movie with my girl and we both loved it            and even though charlize theron cutter her hair baldshe looked pretty badass in the movie
Jul 10 2015,positive,action packed thriller update that surpasses the original in all aspects cherese theron  all female army  band together with the new max tom hardy rag tag group to undue their corrupt rulerone not to miss ra reviews
Jul 10 2015,positive,a film whose visual scope exceeds anything of the last decade if not longer
Jul 10 2015,negative,should have waited to see it on hbo
Jul 10 2015,positive,visually stunning visually entertaining pretty much this is the best film of 2015 to date  i went in not knowing an absolute thing of mad max so this was amazing to see  the most fun ive ever had in theaters
Jul 10 2015,positive,amazing perfect combination of action oscar worthy acting inspired landscapes and more action well directed the best part is real action no bad animation
Jul 9 2015,positive,ok not sure why people think it was so great  no mel
Jul 9 2015,negative,absolutely horrible this was the worst the dumbest the most rediculous movie i have ever seen how in the hell did this get good ratings from anyone
Jul 9 2015,positive,ive seen it twice the movie has subtle details and treats you like an adult doesnt hold your hand the whole way its a nonstop roller coaster of action and i cant wait to take it for another spin
Jul 9 2015,positive,great action great acting great stunts great effects great director  if this movie doesnt win at least one oscar i could cry
Jul 9 2015,positive,a fun filled action ride that will be remembered as a classic thanks to its actingstuntseffectsand full blown madness
Jul 9 2015,positive,pretty wild movie just missing tina turner or i give it 5 stars
Jul 9 2015,positive,popcorn selling gold this modern day george miller soon to be classic does not follow any hollywood rules of how to make a blockbuster fail mad max delivers  two hours of good old fashion action packed fun sequels please
Jul 9 2015,positive,easily the best action movie ive seen the dark knight is more of a crime movie and the only other movies that come close are the bourne movies but there is no recent movie like mad max fury road hollywood seems to think that audiences like fancy cgi tricks and countless twists and turns that confuse you too much with the occasional fight to try to both keep audiences interested and distract them from the utter inanity of the plot fury road has none of that fury road is what weve all been waiting for a pure story no dumb twists practical effects and finally and most importantly raw thrilling action in all its unadulterated glory sweeping wide shots beautiful cinematography george miller has come to save us all if you want a nobs movie watch fury road
Jul 9 2015,positive,one of the best action movies i have ever seen
Jul 9 2015,positive,a masterpiece of art george millers own magnum opus stunning visuals masterful and daring stunts who doesnt want to see life threatening car chases filled with excitement
Jul 9 2015,negative,what an incredibly retarded movie walked out after an hour absolutely unwatchable what the hell was charlize theron thinking
Jul 9 2015,neutral,the story line should have been developed more which would have made me care about the nonstop chase sequences
Jul 9 2015,positive,amazing action film that feel like a 2 hour video game boss battle
Jul 9 2015,positive,a masterpiece mad max fury road is what i would consider to be the best movie of the year so far george miller returns to his mad max franchise thirty years after the third installment to make the best movie in the series you get excellent performances from everyone in the cast charlize theron is almost oscar worthy also if you worried about tom hardy being able to fill the very big shoes that mel gibson set out for him he does it with flying colors the action scenes are some of the best ive ever seen using mostly practical effects this allows for the viewer to believe everything they are seeing is actually happening and damn right it is the duo of director george miller and cinematographer john seale is something to marvel at both do some of their best work and its beautiful to watch the entire time the movie also fleshes out the characters rather then letting them be onedimensional and uninteresting this is caused by a surprising amount of emotional scenes not crying territory but emotional in a lesser way mad max fury road is the best movie of the year so far in my eyes and i would love to see a movie i like more than it come out before december 31st
Jul 9 2015,positive,this is the best action movie ive ever seen     hands down    this shit makes me happy i love everything about this movie    for the first hour you dont get a break they go hard for an hour and you dont even notice how long its been it was only when i got to take a breath and looked at my watch that i realized that an hour had gone by     theres so much to love about this film i love the gradual laying out of information they didnt give you a 20 minute narration about the future they didnt do pans of different cities or a montage of the war you just see a shot of the main city and its fucked you see people toiling people with white war face paint fake verne troyer in stephen hawkings chair they dont explain it there they let it marinate you figure it out as time goes on what the hell any of this means    let me gush about the action this movie could have easily been tom hardy fighting off thousands of maniacs it could have been any other action movie but it wasnt     you could probably recall every death in the movie     let me say that again    you could probably recall every death in the movie    how special is that nowadays you have scenes where hundreds of people die in seconds oh    this movie though gave each character some time you saw them you knew who they were even if it was just some minion that got offed you saw them on screen they might have had some lines you saw them do some stuff you get invested in these people so their deaths actually mean something    not saying you needed a lot just a little bit     slight spoilers the old bitties that max finds later you dont know much about them they didnt give a long backstory about themselves you knew they were tough women they had a little about themselves and whenever one of them bit the dust you felt bad     and max never fell in love with furiousa didnt become this thing of they had sex no he begrudingly helped and then grew a bit attached and then like a badass fucking walked into the sunset a great antihero if furiousa ever were to tell max she loved him he would say i know hes a badass through and through     fuck it its just an amazing movie just watch it shit
Jul 9 2015,positive,good movie coulda been better
Jul 9 2015,positive,what a film 2 hours of gripping action plus the captivating charlize theron
Jul 9 2015,positive,a must see movie
Jul 9 2015,positive,insanely fun insanely simple insanely messedup and just plain insane mad max fury road goes full speed ahead for the entire runtime
Jul 9 2015,positive,come on 87 average rating the movie is highly entertaining but hardly a masterpiece you should reconsider your ranking procedures or you will lose credibility
Jul 8 2015,positive,a furious tale of survival jampacked with exhilarating surprises intensely gripping cinematography attractive cast delivering powerful acting performances mindblowing effects raging action sequences vigorous motion picture score handsdown one of the greatest dystopian action films i have ever seen
Jul 8 2015,negative,it is hard to really explain my feelings on the movie  the good news is you can watch the movie in any language because there is so little dialog  they blew a lot up chased each other through the desert and blew some more things up  there was a lot of very weird stuff in this movie  we actually left and decided we had far more enjoyable things to do like count the socks in our sock drawer  we like a lot of variety of movies and were very sad how poor this one was
Jul 8 2015,positive,ten  yuppp cant wait for the next one
Jul 8 2015,positive,i believe you should judge a film on different standards  a comedy cant be judged like a drama and an action film like a thriller      i also do not like to compare sequels by each other    as an action film this is a fine fine film  very good acting  very good for an action chase movie story  great action and special effects  very good bad guys and great greta hero in max      i love that he did not talk until like 30 mins in  i love that it stayed true to the original material and yet was fresh  i guess it helps to have the same director  i really can not say anything really bad about this movie  it is not 5 stars as an action movie but a solid 4 stars and worth your money to pay and see and enjoy
Jul 8 2015,positive,loved it reminded me of mad max
Jul 8 2015,positive,loved the special effects and the amazing performance of charlize
Jul 8 2015,negative,i really will have to watch this movie again after reading all the other reviews i feel ive missed something
Jul 8 2015,positive,thats bat shit crazy
Jul 8 2015,positive,with phenomenal acting and lots of scifi action mad max fury road will forever be exhilarating  even if  the film contains 100  percent grotesque
Jul 8 2015,positive,embrace the madness that is fury road  this film must be seen to be believed
Jul 8 2015,positive,so rad it was a great ride
Jul 8 2015,negative,aesthetically displeasing overly color corrected mess with an undercooked plot i usually complain about plots being too convoluted nowadays but mad max was a rare one in a post nolan world of overcooked plots sadly i dont think it delivered that makes me sad because it would be a nice trend to start seeing more to the point visceral films but done well like the originals sans thunderdome mad max was like a guy with a beautiful les paul dressed well on a stage you think wow this is really going to be some performance i can tell but then when he starts playing its horrible and you feel embarrassed everyone else giving this movie such a high rating its like they saying hey but hes dressed well and has a nice guitarhe has to be good they completely ignnore the fact that the dude cant play theyre taken away by the superficial but not the substance of the film the writing is terrible its in no way shape or form a feminist film its antifeminist the theme is save the pretty models that can breed and leave the fat milkers back in the hell hole thats hardly feminism and actually sets feminism back in film about 40 years mad max fury road might have been cool when i was 14 but im not even sure about that there was so much action it was boring let me give you an example if everything is in caps it loses its impact and just seems like i am yelling constantly there has to be quiet moments that shade the bright action
Jul 8 2015,positive,apocalyptic films are usually a hit or miss subject many are forgettable or cliched to the point of being one big joke kind of like the film within the film by the mackenzie brothers in strange brew some films get it really right while others get it really really wrong with disastrous and silly results    when one thinks of the modern apocalyptic film the template for that genre of cinema was crafted by george miller his major debut mad max 1979 was less apocalyptic and more a 70s exploitation car chase flick sent to hell and back making the film an achievement in film making it pushed the envelope at the end of the decade    it would be the sequel to that film mad max 2 or the road warrior here in the states that would define millers vision of the world beyond the end the people that lived after the event the road warrior is one of those rare films that exceeds its predecessor with a story that while simple is presented in a way that is unforgettable and burns itself into your psyche    well skip mad max beyond thunderdome it has its place and its moments but is really a film that miller cared very little about as he left the world of max for thirty years    mad max fury road is a return to the supercharged film that the road warrior happened to be max tom hardy once again runs afoul of a mutant clan using slave labor and water to control their little piece of a broken world led by immortan joe played by hugh keayesbyrne who played the toe cutter in the original film a chase ensues after  furiosa charlize theron in an awesome performance steals a commodity that is sacred to the enraged leader    a simple story if there ever was one but this goes beyond that fury road is open to close action with very little time to catch your breath some films are called a roller coaster ride that age old cliche that they slap on posters fury road is like going into hell  without any looking back its funny that a film set in a fictional version of our world can draw so many parallels to life itself    what really stands out in fury road is the role of women for a film titled mad max the strongest character in the film is furiosa a warrior that does not give up leading her ironic cargo to a promised land that may or may not exist distant memories or wishful thinking there are moments when max feels like a side character and this is furiosas movie its an amazing thing to see in film where a woman is neither a pawn nor a gimmick but an integral piece to the film she is the center that everything about fury road revolves around    i was more than sketchy when i heard that another mad max film was on the way so many returns in the last decade have floundered over the indulgences of these sequels and reboots its about a 5050 split in that arena fury road is probably the best of the bunch and is probably one of the best films of 2015 so far it is a credit to credit masterpiece that really cuts at the other blockbusters of this year and the almost stagnant world of super hero movies fury road is ironically a breath of fresh air in a cinematic universe that tends to regurgitate last years product dare i say that this film is millers masterpiece possibly even surpassing the road warrior i dont know but i really really want to watch it again
Jul 8 2015,positive,it is impossible to talk about mad max fury road without mentioning spoilers the premise of the films vehicular society simply demands it but whereas the fast and furious and transformers franchises have fetishized cars and vehicle stunts george miller has used each of the vehicles in fury road and the other mad max films as setpieces over merchandise the action films of today all knowingly or otherwise owe a great deal to miller after all this is the man who crashed his own car in the first mad max film which was nothing more than an aussie bmovie in some critics eyes thats dedication miller has always understood peril as a means of narrative from his early years on mad max through to his more surprising familyfriendly ventures on the babe and happy feet series    so before venturing on into the wasteland beware of spoilers  but fear the drivers even more    max rockatansky is wonderfully realised by tom hardy bringing a more distinctively erratic side to mel gibsons original portrayal the flippant nature between maxs vulnerability and laconic bluntness remains true to the character as does the quest to wander the eternal wasteland further away from any civilization much to his dismay there are plenty of different cultures within this area of the wasteland including acrobatic rock riders the unflinching vuvalini tribe and the vicious war boys who all bow brainwashed to hugh keysbyrnes nightmarish caesar figure immortan joe miller never gets too deep into each society which could at any moment break just as max emotionally distances himself from civilization leading to languid shots in which disgusting hags on stilts over patches of water project onto our memories enough to intrigue us but with caution    gratefully miller understands that this is no longer the 1980s in which a star actor such as gibson even at the time of the third mad max film when mel gibson fights midget in arena was more likely to be a film synopsis than a newspaper headline cannot hold the screen alone as schwarzenegger and stallone still vie to this film is not a oneactionhero deal and so charlize therons furiosa becomes the emotional and narrative focus logically with maxs stoic lack of dialogue and motivations a modern audience requires someone else to ground the world in which they are thrust into and believe me once the opening credits begin revving there are only fleeting pauses for breath furiosa is levelheaded and utterly believable in the wasteland setting fury road is her odyssey her homecoming her mission max is just in the wrong place at the wrong time    furiosas quest to release immortan joes wives including revelatory performances from abbey lee zoe kravitz and even rosie huntingtonwhitely on the path to forgiveness after transformers dark of the moon and reunite with the vuvalini mothers at the heralded green place has already sparked a riot amongst male rights activists and meninists alike rightly so if anyone believes men to be more oppressed than women then they dont deserve to enjoy spectacular films such as fury road the gender politics of the narrative cannot be ignored when viewing particularly in an age of women as romantic foils and damsels in distress a generation after ellen ripley and sarah connor lets not talk about lucy from well lucy    the fuss over the current dialogue of gender politics in action cinema cannot have delighted miller more the mad max franchise has always had strong women as survivors from the second entrys rather telling warrior woman to the thirds polar opposites of tribal leader nix and scheming autocrat aunty entity add in the 30 years since beyond thunderdome with anomalous strong female action heroes mostly played by michelle rodriguez in subpar films but mostly traditional weaklings and you have opportunity for a blow at hollywood under furiosas guidance of the harsh reality of the fury road stretching from the citadel to the green place and back again the five scantilyclad virginal though not literally young women grow into combatready survivors before the films conclusion even as an audience we see victorias secret models and transformers girls arguably the same in a microcosm of a potentially exploitative carwash scene transform into action heroes precariously clambering across rigs to shoot down their attackers this isnt militant feminism this isnt even 90s girl power this is what action movies nay all movies should have been a long time ago    with gender politics on action films fixed miller decides he might as well fix everything else that action cinema has ruined over the past three decades each character gets a solid introduction before they slam an inch away from a spikyexplosivetyrebased death from the crew of furiosas war rig to the enslaved war boys and those varying on the moral spectrum especially the devout then doubtful disciple of immortan joe nux played by a terrific and utterly unrecognisable nicholas hoult the inventive design of the vehicles makes them more like setpieces than purely surface images when you first see the manic arsonist guitarist surrounded by a wall of amplifiers wide enough to make marty mcfly jealous you anxiously wait for the set piece that will take place on that particular vehicle the guitarist is also a key feature of the soundtrack with junkie xl using the chaotic music to stamp a mark of citizenship upon the particular tribes across the journey mixing in suspenseful looming soundbites to show the evernearing distance between threats    as the threats escalate there is no pause for thought as to just how extreme fury road is to the senses just when audiences had recovered from whiplash and fast  furious 7 miller speeds in fullthrottle with a chaotic vision of the future society without any space for meditation old guzzoliners will be satisfied with the culmination of thirty years worth of pentup spectacle and new fans will discover what every action movie has been missing the future belongs to mad max as it deservedly should
Jul 8 2015,positive,when it comes to action movies it doesnt get any better than mad max fury road the movie offers brilliant performances surprising thematic depth and some if the most jawdropping action sequences to ever be put on the big screen mad max fury road can be shelved with the best action movies of all time
Jul 7 2015,positive,i can say a lot about this movie but if you just want to be entertained with explosions and killing and violence this is the movie to see but if youre looking for a story line and meaning behind what theyre doing and how they got to this point this movie is not for you i was entertained and that was it i could not follow the storyline because it jumped all over the place i would recommend this movie if you had nothing else to do or if you just like stuff blowing up
Jul 7 2015,positive,i saw this movie last friday very good sorry for the late notice
Jul 7 2015,positive,easily the best of the mad max franchise easily the best action adventure film of the year and one of the best films ive ever seen fury road transcends its genre and gore with heartwarming relationships and incredible depth of character i absolutely have to watch this film a third time
Jul 7 2015,positive,exceptional summer flick
Jul 7 2015,positive,if you like action youll love this i would give it more stars of o had the option
Jul 7 2015,positive,fantastic great action packed ride
Jul 7 2015,positive,the first 5 minutes before the title shot are unnecessarybut from then on it is a great movie with creative nonstop action  the depiction of the postapocalyptic world is a bit over the top but clever and always entertaining
Jul 7 2015,negative,mad max fury road 2015 c120m  d george miller tom hardy charlize theron nicholas hoult hugh keaysbyrne loud headacheinducing mad max adventure fourth after beyond thunderdome follows relentless rebellion against disgusting tyrannical ruler in postapocalyptic australia with help of mostly inaudible loner hardy lots of fireworks but little magic hard to care about a movie with such perfunctory characterizations and plodding unimaginative story superproduction but lack of humanity hurt the effort larger in scale than other films in series but bigness doesnt equal greatness great names though rictus erectus toast the knowing etc
Jul 7 2015,positive,full throttle power house its maybe the biggest and wildest action flick of all time it has a script though not the best thus the story withhold the fall of time set in apocalyptic wasteland of futuristic scale in natures rawness dessert sun and drough hardcore muscles and americanized motorsexism draped in firepower and flames it cant get any more manly than this the visuals are incredible the sky and the dessert are revealing stunning sceanrios for impeccable beauty of visuality overwhelming
Jul 7 2015,positive,leave it to george miller to come out and completely demolish every modern action film by putting them in their place the posters say from the mastermind george miller and they arent lying saying he is a varied director is an understatement only he could go from happy feet to something like this the director that influenced action films with his original mad max trilogy does the same thing 30 years later with mad max fury road a film that gives audiences what they want in their action films and makes it a totally thrilling experience that transports us to another world simply put this film is something not of this planet    ill admit when i first saw pictures of tom hardy as max he looked more like sad max than mad i did think he was a little bit of an odd choice but then again the quietest guy is usually the one you do not want to mess with and the film demonstrates that many actors were considered in the many years of development but tom hardy was a great choice and had the voice to match and he didnt have that muzzle on his face that much i am glad he got it off though or else that would have gone into his eyes i understand he is a man of few words but he could have just said he didnt want to hurt furiosa when they met each other he didnt even look like the others but then again who would you trust if you were in their situation but still i liked how they met and how they managed to work together the story is mostly told through emotions with the looks on peoples faces and the visuals they make us care for the characters and it adds to the overall scope of a classic action film hardy does so many little things that make max so real charlize theron is an absolute powerhouse in this film shes always been a great actress but shes so awesome to watch in this film even things like her arm add so much as well and also as showcase smart use of cgi i do want to name the rest of the cast individually just to give them the individual praise they deserve but theyre all excellent and give allin performances to add to the crazy even if some of the actresses of the women that furiosa saves arent the best    i will say that it was nice to see hugh keaysbyrne in this film and was totally awesome funnily enough max and his character dont even meet and i felt sorry for nicholas hoults nux as he always seemed to be knocked around and forgotten about and for a film where everybody is getting thrown around all the time thats saying something however his character does actually open a door to the mindset of this group of people and does provide some quieter moments amongst the action i did find it kind of odd how that person opened up so quickly to hear him speak although im sure after their previous encounters and the way that person looked it would make sense for them to open up but it could be a trap they didnt know either way admittedly some could say you arent there for deep characters but it lead to good moments and adds to the films vivid world given that it is a mad max film it has to have some sort of car chase in there and given that this is being touted as a 2 hour car chase the filmmakers of course manage to make it make sense and it fits excellently the storyboard for the film was made even before the script was the story does sneak up on you though it looks like it will be one thing at first but then evolves into something else its smart and allows time for our characters to think although i know the people furiosa saved were different from the rest i just thought there would have been more you might be annoyed by the fact that they spend all this time trying to go to a place and then come back from it but they make it work and it isnt like its a deal breaker regardless its a very powerful piece of filmmaking and its true only the mad survive    the technical aspects of this film are absolutely glorious and this is an absolutely beautiful film in every department the 150 million was spend perfectly the cinematography is very vibrant and so clear john seale certainly knows his way around a desert after filming the english patient and that same beauty is seen once more he came out of retirement for a good reason the shots are clear perfectly shot and the landscapes are out of this world seeing the lights slowly crawl closer to you with your vehicle trapped in the sand gave such a sinister and ominous feeling all the types of editing for this film are excellent the scenes are cut perfectly the sound is perfect all of them it is just excellent the soundtrack is perfect highoctane unbelievably fitting and most of all catchy however it also has its quieter moments that are awesome as well hell even furiosas truck horn sounds like a beat the part where it used preexisting classical music not saying what it is as to not spoil it seemed rather odd at first but it works and perhaps i just shouldnt question something like that its crazy like everything else i noticed that the film fades out to black a few times and it felt quite original as well as the fact that most shots after it fades back are slowly built up the 3d was excellently implemented and one scene right at the end with something flying towards the screen seemed tailormade for it even if it looked odd probably because everything else was practical effectsit also seemed kind of odd that the character involved in that scene was gone even though what he was using was flung at the screen but then again they probably did go flying and maybe did not want us to see that because they probably guessed everyone would love that character not saying who as to not spoil anything going back to see the film again i did notice some very odd jump cuts right before something was about to happen but it only happened twice or i only noticed it twice right before we are introduced to the comadoof warrior who is an absolutely fantastic and insane addition who has a great backstory who like most of the things in this film i couldnt believe my eyes when i saw and when max is on the back of the truck pulling things off i have an idea why it was done like this but im just mentioning it    the practical effects here are the key to making it all work and they are just a sight for sore eyes george miller schools all modern action films and reminds us of why we are getting sick of those films all the action is memorable and each chase has its moments that make them stand out from each other it all adds to the excellent world building that the previous films have and they explain maxs past in a smart way without having to be bogged down by an origin story or something for fans of the original you know what it is but it doesnt downright tell you what happened but it respects its audience enough to know that they can work it out speaking of the originals of course with the release of this some reviewers have gone back to review them and of course their scores are lower now even the posters and artwork are awesome and the home media releases are going to have so many unique features one of which was teased in the black and white trailer it just seems like every aspect of this film has been done right the combination of the thrilling action and excellent music honestly gave me chills throughout the entirety of the film and even if people arent aware about the practical effects they know they have seen something special with this it all has to do with how our brains put together cgi and reality in a film and considering this was pretty much all practical effects it speaks for itself what a lovely day it is     the film has references to the previous films the opening shot and awesome intro being a perfect example that poor lizard but i cant help but think if max had moved sooner the interceptor wouldnt have gotten destroyed but miller seems to hate that car for some reason and always finds a way to destroy it max wears the same jacket as mels max and there even seemed to be a reference to a character in the third film that needed two people to fully work properly there were talks of mel gibson having some sort of cameo in this but it didnt happen they thought he was the person with the long hair in the trailer and that certainly would have been something to see he was going to be in this film back when it was first thought up but gibson and miller were both doing something else and apparently even 911 of all things had something to do with it as well     i heard some complaints before i saw it about furiosa being more of a leading role than max and that this is compounded by the fact that she is in front of him on the cover but seriously those people seriously need to grow up yes it does seem like max is hardly in it at the start and he seems to be overshadowed by everything else going on at the start but it isnt like he is a noncharacter and he quickly gets into the drivers seat they all work with each other and it fits however a complaint with regards to that is that it felt like it had too many characters in it a sequel to a film would generally have more characters for our lead to interact with as the previous trilogy showed us but i like seeing max being on his own even when it got to the third film when he had others he was still the lone hero saying all this i know its a new take it works the characters are great and the people they meet later on in the film are pure badass it makes sense for everyone to be battleready in a world like this the only things i thought were strange is the flash that happens when nux headbutts someone at the start and furiosas war paint on her head seemed to keep disappearing and reappearing i did wonder why it wasnt called road fury but the title we have fits as the road certainly is filled with fury and nux even mentions the fury road at one point it also seems kind of odd that that character would shoot that rifle so close to maxs ear i know they were leaning on him but as the film shows ouch    one thing that made the chases in the first films so spectacular is that they kept growing and kept getting more elaborate as time went on this film seemed to explode right from the start it certainly wasnt a bad thing and i dont mean to sound like im comparing them its just something to note but this film certainly was massive throughout its running time and never slacked you might question that a pregnant woman is climbing on the outside of a truck and that the humans should conserve their gas and ammo instead of randomly spraying it everywhere but come on you just have to jump in and accept this crazy world although there were many points where characters clearly should have died like max being attached to that vehicle and being flung around when it crashed but its all good however with that there are some very clever and subtle parallels that it portrays about us these are found sprinkled throughout the film as well in many different ways in mad max 2 the road warrior i questioned why the villains were wearing pretty much no clothing but in this film they have their lowerbody covered and it makes sense why the top half is exposed given the parallels i mentioned earlier there is so much swinging around in this film by the polecats that i kept expecting johnny depp to show up in his films he always finds something to swing on     its a little strange that this film was kept on the backburner for so long and before that development hell but when i first heard of this i just thought that george miller had to be attached to it and he was there was no way they could do it without him and he was back into the directors after some time had passed and he does an excellent job in a year filled with quite a lot of sequels and remakes my hopes were on this one and they werent unfounded hell there is even a poster for this film that looks like the originals its just awesome i wanted this film to keep on going some could say you would feel exhausted but once again this is george miller he knows what he is doing this film just put me in such a good mood and i wanted to see it again right after it finished hell even while i was watching this film i knew i wanted to see it again and i did i went back to see it the day after and just kept seeing and adding new things to this review like the previous trilogy i will watch this many more times in the future without a doubt whilst watching this film i was happy to look at the time and see how much of the film was left it made me happy seeing that i had quite a long time left now if that isnt a hallmark of a good film i dont know what is this film has to be nominated for many oscars i will be quite shocked if it is not but then again its the academy so maybe i shouldnt be judging it on its own without comparing it with pulse pounding action smart direction powerful performances and an engrossing world mad max fury road is a very unique and memorable film with so many spectacular setpieces and overall has a really raw energy to it that is unique to this film this is why we go to the cinema to see action films this film transports us to another world and it truly comes alive the film insane balls to the wall visceral exhilarating a game changer groundbreaking a landmark and totally hardcore as well as many other adjectives this film made me smile to no end left me exhausted in the best kind of way it is certainly the best action film of recent years is easily one of the best films of 2015 already and is probably one of the best action films ever made mad max fury road is a milestone for a generation the future belongs to the mad indeed
Jul 7 2015,positive,pure bad ass car chases done by the master himself max isnt even the main character charlize kills it as the main character instead

Jul 6 2015,positive,engulfed in its raw explosive energy mad max fury roads dangerous insanity can only be described as a wildly choreographed rock opera of chaos choking on is throat thickening dust viewers collide head on with surreal imagery in a relentless postapocalyptic reality where desperation is a key weapon for survival     taking a mere three decades to finally achieve his visceral dreams director george miller has simply out done himself love it or hate it fury road is an amazingly envisaged cinematic ride on the wild side and one hell of a movie     wandering alone in the desert wasteland that is now earth the internally tortured mad max tom hardy is taken prisoner by a ruthless apparatusmaintained beastlike dictator immortan hugh keaysbyrne and adopted by one of his tribe of ethereal war boy sycophants nux nicolas hout as a human blood bag     departing the citadel under the guise of acquire more oil elite war rig driver imperator furiosa charlize theron has a far more tenuous deed to abscond with the warlords most prize possessions his five captive breeders     unleashing his army of devotes led by nux and his unwilling hood ornament max the rebels ruthlessly pursue the escapes engaging in a vicious road war where escape doesnt mean survival     designed with minimal dialogue it is the palpable acting from this almost perfect cast that captivates from bizarre milking maidens to the guitar wailing undead unexplainable hybrid cars and the namibian desert there is a ferocious intensity to simply every element     the verdict certainly not for everyone myself included this is definitely one of those films you have to appreciate for its style and technical tenacity     published  canberra weekly magazine  date of publication  21052015

Jul 5 2015,positive,mad max may be the very definition of badass its definitely action packed and very important too it successfully created an interesting world with its own rules and perks from what ive heard this delivers exactly what it was expected to deliver
Jul 5 2015,positive,this movie was fresh and manic  lots of crazy people living in a strange and desperate time its not for the faint hearted or emotionally perturbed folks it is worth watching but prepare to be extremely exhausted when its over great script but its one movie i never want to see again
Jul 5 2015,positive,it was a fun film to watch i have never seen the previous films as of now i plan to some day
Jul 5 2015,positive,i wasnt exited to see it coz i thought it will be a big fat failure comparing to hollywood legend mel gibson timeless classic but when i did i wasnt disappointed due to brilliant talented charlize theron tom hardy was ok as well but any comparison with gibson will be unfair for him
Jul 5 2015,positive,were only half way through 2015 but im sure mad max fury road will be my favourite film of this year    george miller has brought the old school style of action films back to the cinema showing the next generation how it should be done    the heavy reliance on cgi in films in recent years has been done either because it was cheaper than practically doing it or it was easier to do on computer that in real life where ever you can film something practically i feel it should be shot practically otherwise it looks lazy especially on a big budget film thats where george miller has knock this film out of the park with the prefect blend of cgi and practical effects    charlize theron puts on a great performance in this movie as does the rest of the cast however the character of max himself doesnt feel like the lead role he feels more like vessel for us to view this postapocalyptic world his adventures and characters he meets along the way     the make up and costume design are brilliantly done i especially liked the immortan joes outfit its definitely going to be this years halloween theme    overall this is great pedaltothemetal action pack film definitely recommend everyone to go watch this
Jul 5 2015,negative,really not my kind of movie and really it felt kind of stupid and uneccerary if they had not gone on their drive and just killed joe in his home instead the film would have ended the same and they would have saved millions of dollars making it so i dont know
Jul 5 2015,positive,absolutely amazing nonstop action joy ride
Jul 5 2015,positive,this was the definition of visually stunning  intense adrenaline packed ride from start to finish and back again  fans of the original will love this one
Jul 5 2015,positive,wow  a well made visually fascinating action film with a wonderful story
Jul 5 2015,positive,this had a great cast and was quite different in its story line and the characters dont get me wrong i liked it however  i still prefer the original 80s version more
Jul 5 2015,negative,terrible film no story line just boring waste of money
Jul 5 2015,positive,what a movie   what a lovely movie     this is how action films should be not high emotion drama bullsht sometimes you just wanna see a guy with a guitar on top of a monster truck shoot flames out of the neck and that was in this film sometimes the weirdness gets a bit uncomfortable but thats just to show how society had degraded from the old world watch this movie now
Jul 5 2015,positive,its relentless trying to convince us with quick edits and brooding closeups that there is connection between these characters many transitions make absolutely no sense
Jul 5 2015,positive,insane action packed and great music mad max fury road is one hell of a movie
Jul 5 2015,neutral,55  saw this on 5715  good but extremely overrated george miller makes a great action movie but kills the mad max character by giving him too little screen time mel gibson was a better mad max for better and worse charlize therons furiosa always overshadows mad max its not tom hardys fault he just didnt have much to do here theron steals the show and nicholas hault is the second best character here the film simply recreates a road warrior kind of mad max movie but with barely minimal plotting for a film of 150 million budget fury road looks really cheap although it has got some good action sequences here and there the gun blazing wives are just a bunch of good looking chicks the villain is extremely bad and is not even threatening mr miller has directed the movie very well i wish that they at least give mad max something to do in the possible sequels to this film
Jul 5 2015,positive,loved it cant wait for a sequel
Jul 5 2015,positive,amazing it will make you believe that intelligent powerful action movies are still possible in the age of bayhem
Jul 5 2015,positive,best movie i have seen in a long time reminds me of borderlands
Jul 5 2015,positive,epic action movie best in a long while and point for badass ladies who are not just mens pretty backdrop
Jul 5 2015,positive,practical effects  straightforward narrative  plenty of atmosphere
Jul 4 2015,negative,the visuals and action are top notch but the story just wasnt there  even the old mad max films had more character development than this  its worth watching but i doubt youll ever wantneed to watch it again
Jul 4 2015,positive,keeps you on the edge of your seat action packed
Jul 4 2015,negative,i just am blown away by how many other people like this plotless movie i feel like the whole world is trolling me
Jul 4 2015,positive,best action movie i ever saw in this 10 years thank god for this movie and all the cast can make posible a piece of art like it is this movie
Jul 4 2015,positive,lives up to all the hype relentless action and fun
Jul 4 2015,negative,why even call this madmax its more about therons character than anyone else and its a poor imitation of the original  basically like comparing 300 greenscreentastic to a true war film something lacking something quite superficial about it all
Jul 4 2015,positive,you know hope is a mistake if you cant fix whats broken youll go insane max
Jul 4 2015,positive,outstanding in every possible way
Jul 4 2015,negative,crazy stupid and boring and tom  hardy adds to his ridiculous voices collection what a way to ruin a good set off films
Jul 4 2015,positive,awe inspiring action through out
Jul 4 2015,positive,i had never seen the mad max franchise and i dont think it is necessary to watch this movie the movie keeps dialogues simple and little which makes the movie fascinating george miller was able to prove what a good action movie through stunning visuals the whole movie is breath taking and intense which makes audience unable to eat their popcorns every action scenes are memorable and awesome while the characters are iconic and complex i am relieved that miller was able to show us that action movies are not dead yet
Jul 4 2015,positive,the visuals and production of this film are incredibly imaginative and jawdropping the action sequences are full of life and fun while the story is really simple this is the prime example of movies where cg and real props are used really well side by side
Jul 4 2015,positive,i must say mad maxfury road succeeded all my expectations and then some it had me on the edge of my seat and blew me away with every masterful shot and crazy action set piece    firstly the cinematography is fantastic with ever shot feeling like a beautiful picture the desert landscape is breathtaking and you are immersed into this crazy postapocalyptic world from the first shot of max    secondly the direction george miller director of the original trilogy completely out does himself in this film the scenes are directed to perfection with no shaky cam just beautiful wide shots of destruction and chaos    thirdly the characters the characters are brilliantly fleshed out with my personal favorite being charlize therons imperator furiosa i feel her character has the most depth and theron gives a truly deep and emotional performance tom hardys max rockatansky keeps in line with the mel gibson version of the character a no nonsense man of few words who has his own personal struggle nicholas hoult also gives a great performance as the quite comedic and heartfelt nux immortan joe is also a particularly striking twisted character and his presence can be felt throughout the narrative     and last but not least the action words cannot describe the through epic scale of these action set pieces the use of practical effects add a layer of realness to the chaos of these sequences these are not predictable scenes and the audience should get a real feeling that anything can happen    overall i think mad madfury road is a action masterpiece with brilliant characters and a fully realized world of chaos and destruction this movie is a spectacle of madness and although this may not be for everyone it sure was for me
Jul 4 2015,positive,the summers best movie
Jul 4 2015,positive,if salvador dali had ever made an action film mad max fury road would be that film a beautifully shot and wonderfully written summer blockbuster
Jul 4 2015,positive,i think i liked it not sure to be honest
Jul 4 2015,positive,the action sequences are the reason to go see this movie  the story line is too far fetched
Jul 4 2015,positive,it was really random but full of action
Jul 4 2015,positive,as someone who has never seen the original three movies and who didnt have any expectations regarding this sequelreebot hybrid thing i can only say that this is one hell of a movie 55
Jul 4 2015,positive,absolutely relentless stuff filled with outrageous sets of stunts action sequences which never get repetitive this probably added a new dimension to postapocalyptic action adventure genre
Jul 4 2015,positive,all sorts of awesome  this is what should action movies should look like
Jul 4 2015,negative,this movie is the perfect example of why i dont use this site to judge movies i will go see  i almost walked out on this movie  it was absolute garbage  junk film if ever there was one  i couldnt even recommend this one for dvd viewing dont waste your time
Jul 4 2015,positive,the action film of the year and the best film of the year so far an enigmatic tom hardy reluctantly joins forces with a blistering charlize theron in a mad dash across a desert waste land from the murderous and violent masses that inhabit a broken and hopeless world awesome
Jul 4 2015,positive,i love action movies but this movie is one straight action sequence easy for the writers they only had to write about 10 lines well shot movie just struggled for story in my opinion
Jul 3 2015,positive,incredible movie and what makes it better is that all the crash scenes fight scenes explosions people swinging on poles and ropes at 60 mph etc is all real the only cgi effects are the water flowing out of the citadel and the giant sandstorm
Jul 3 2015,neutral,interesting action but what was the point of it all
Jul 3 2015,neutral,i think im totally missing something the movie was fine there were a lot of good things about it but it was just so muchby halfway through i was hoping it was over
Jul 3 2015,positive,having never heard of mad max prior to seeing this film i was delightfully surprised in how much it captured and held my attention great acting great dialogue impressive visual effects i still dont get the dude with the guitar but other than that i found myself quite entertained
Jul 3 2015,positive,its as good as they say it is
Jul 3 2015,positive,this was a fantastic reboot for this franchise  its really a good story and the world created by the director is truly amazing and unique  great cinematography and awesome characters the villain was great  the creativity of this postapocalyptic world blew me away  i cant wait for a sequel because they can take this in so many directions which should be much more interesting than something like thunderdome
Jul 3 2015,positive,wow very organic film with real special effects not just computer graphics loved it better than the original charlene theron stole the movie it was really her film its rare that a remake out does the original in this case it absolutely did 
Jul 3 2015,positive,the cinematography took awhile to get use too  ending was the best dramatic portion of entire movie  on pure blood guts and explosions grade a
Jul 3 2015,negative,one of the most boring films ive ever seen and ive seen a few
Jul 3 2015,positive,minimal plot filled with nonsequiturs but visually interesting face paced but not suspenseful
Jul 3 2015,positive,looked and sounded amazing really exciting
Jul 3 2015,negative,i tried to watch this and literally had to walk out maybe it gets better but it is mindless junk entertainment

Jul 3 2015,positive,this is a blue print of how to make a remake anew
Jul 3 2015,positive,this is the best fucking action movie of the year
Jul 3 2015,negative,if you like watching dismembered disfigured and downright ugly looking human beings act out action sequences in a desert then this movie deserves 4 stars because it does that very well i was grossed out the entire two hours and almost vomited afterwardswish i hadnt seen it
Jul 3 2015,positive,great action packed explosive but gritty film
Jul 3 2015,positive,saw it and still want to see it  i havent had a film lift me off my seat like this in years  an adrenaline sandwich with double helpings of yowser

Jul 2 2015,positive,im so glad i wasnt disappointed one of the best movies ive seen this year
Jul 2 2015,positive,my 2nd favorite film of 2015 is one of the best action movies of the 21st century possibly of all time the simple plot compliment the movie as it lets you sit back and enjoy the spectacle for what it is the only drawback is that towards the middle the story kicks in and really slows down the movie 4755
Jul 2 2015,positive,epic from start to finish max is surprisingly not the main character but that doesnt matter  the action is fantastic from start to finish  the war boys are especially fantastic more please
Jul 2 2015,positive,a film just as insane as its subject and it all turned out great a lovely day indeed its clever and seldom use of cg is appreciated that sandstorm was gorgeous and the practical effects and sets were truly inspired granted the films action scenes were quite long the whole movie felt like the truck chase scene in raiders of the lost ark but there is enough plot to keep it all from looking like a vanity project in all it is an excellent film for all to see
Jul 2 2015,positive,visually this is truly compelling if this movie is to be watched it needs to be seen on a big screen i dont see this as a movie ill come back to
Jul 2 2015,negative,was not worth the ticket price do not see in theaters save your money and get a torrent or wait till it hits netflix deffinitely not a top 10 let alone number 1 jurassic world was better than this and its not even in the top 10 i have lost all faith in you rt and the rt community as a whole
Jul 2 2015,positive,am a giant fan of the original movies i would be lying if i said that i didnt go into the theatre with a sense of trepidation man was i worried for nothing this movie is amazing     end of story    ive seen it three times and will most likely see it again before its out of the theatre
Jul 2 2015,negative,max is a eunuchplain and simple this is not mad maxs movieits furiosas  and while theron does a great job with the task giventhe plot and the movie is way short of my expectations and the 98 tomatometer does baffle meas the original road warrior is such as pleasure to watch over and over again
Jul 2 2015,negative,simple story line characters not very deep action so so go see terminator
Jul 2 2015,positive,three original and remake are two similar but distinctly enjoyable stories this classic leaves a little more to the imagination with a mysterious suspense
Jul 2 2015,negative,by the end of the movie we were like please god not another car chase it has so much action it became mind numbingly boring literally no plot amd horrible dialogue do not believe the hype on this movie it was garbage
Jul 2 2015,positive,one of the best action movies at least in the last decade
Jul 2 2015,positive,crazy wicked destruction fuck bitches
Jul 2 2015,positive,this movie gets it right in so many ways  from the storyline to the cinematography to the action sequences to the actingthis movie is a lesson in how to do movies the right way  one of the best movies of the year and sure to go down as a classic
Jul 2 2015,negative,doesnt have the magic of the original mad max films and mega long at 2 hours bring back mel
Jul 2 2015,negative,no car no dog no plot anybody that thought this was a good movie should not be working reviewing in movies
Jul 2 2015,positive,did not see the movie in 3d on a large screen therefore probably missed out on most of its pure entertainment value without that without appreciating all the full minutes of action warfare fighting i missed out on its potential of being one of my top movies
Jul 2 2015,positive,fantastic story character developement and visual experience
Jul 2 2015,positive,this movie was amazing youre on the edge of your seat during the entire runtime one of the best action movies in a long time
Jul 2 2015,positive,excellent nonstop heavy and fast paced action but pretty much lacking in all other areas basically a group of people drive away from danger while being chased and then realize that they can now be safer back where they drove away from so they turn around a circle chase that is very entertaining but will not make you think at all it might actually make you dumber a top notch action movie nonetheless
Jul 2 2015,positive,oh what a day what a lovely day
Jul 2 2015,positive,epic film must watch
Jul 2 2015,positive,best movie of the year by far
Jul 2 2015,positive,pretty cool but not worth all the hype people were giving it
Jul 2 2015,neutral,the movie itself isnt short of action and if thats what youre into then you wont have any issues with this film but in regards to the story itself its a bit flat and even though the movie is called mad max he wasnt really the focus of the film more so a secondary character to furiosa as it was pretty much her storymission max was literally in the  passenger seat
Jul 2 2015,negative,wow mad max is a total piece of sht
Jul 2 2015,positive,the years best action film
Jul 2 2015,positive,unrealistic future completely different from the original good performances by lead actors in spite of cheesy scenes mindless pointless violence
Jul 2 2015,positive,crazy action amazing direction and a passable plot  if you like action scifi movies this one is great charlize theron is particularly amazing in her role which is really the protagonist and hero of the movie
Jul 2 2015,positive,max isnt mad but this movie is max is tom hardy which is yet another bonus
Jul 1 2015,positive,this latest installment in the series is a serious departure from its roots and an excellent snapshot of the changes in hollywood over the past few decades the pace has been accelerated the action levels increased drastically and the story line well if you are watching a mad max movie for its gripping tale you may want a different past time   my first impression of this movie was that it was the wet dream of a 15 year old male full of cars explosions beautiful women with seemingly no purpose other than to drive the nonexistent plot and a couple crazy guys the film carves an impression based on its fantastical vehicles all of which consume a surprisingly inefficient amount of fuel for a world in which gasoline and water are the two major commodities and the amazing amount of effort put into the stunt work  the majority of the film will be spent watching highspeed chases involving strange cars and shots of the face of whomever is driving interspersed with loud screaming dead bodies and flying maniacs on catapults there is also a doof wagon which comes complete with a flamethrowing guitarist on meth strapped on by bungie cords  all in all mad max fury road stays true to the series humble origins while bringing the effects and action style of a modernday production to a theater near you at a high rate of speed
Jul 1 2015,positive,worth going to see twice
Jul 1 2015,positive,visuals 1010  sound 1010  everything else 1010    this movie was shot to perfection and looked as perfect as can be in addition it keeps you gripped to the edge of your seat with your eyes locked looking at the screen
Jul 1 2015,positive,very good non stop action
Jul 1 2015,positive,intense with amazing effects and stunts i must return to the original seen such a long time ago
Jul 1 2015,positive,visceral intense almost mind numbing nonstop action
Jul 1 2015,positive,ive been waiting a long time for another mad max and it was worth it  this movie is a cinematic masterpiece that defines a franchise that has inspired so many post apocalyptic stories
Jul 1 2015,negative,aside from the gore  well done costuming this movie had no plot and when they tried to implement one it was pointless hated this movie
Jul 1 2015,negative,there is a lack of story   shocked people are saying it is oscar worthy
Jul 1 2015,positive,wheres tge plot i say plot the mkvie says what plot you mean the explosions right ya those are cool i reply and how bout these hot women ya i liked that     4 out of 5
Jul 1 2015,positive,remind me of a quienton tuerontio film great action and very intriguing
Jul 1 2015,positive,wasnt sure if this was gonna be my cup of tea but omg its superb theron and hardy are both excellant and the entire film is fast frantic and hilariously funny bring on part 2
Jul 1 2015,positive,my favorite movie thus far
Jul 1 2015,positive,high intensity enjoyable visuals
Jul 1 2015,positive,a freaking fantastic ride on this fury road
Jul 1 2015,positive,really good movie amazing action sequences with some pretty good plot and a really interesting world
Jul 1 2015,positive,this movie was awesome best action movie in a long time
Jul 1 2015,negative,the was one of the worse movies ive seen  it doesnt have the cult interest of the first mad max movies that is tries to emulate  save your self from the 2 hours long road raging movie
Jul 1 2015,positive,a very solid action chase film  this was surprisingly good given the heaps of crappie films that we have been subjected to this summer  not much dialogue but that does not matter in the end its a futuristic clint eastwood spaghetti western with updated special effects
Jul 1 2015,negative,the 80s was the mad max movies the film stoudies should leave this well alone i will not go near this movie  simondvdhotmailcouk
Jul 1 2015,positive,okay im just going to be honest that i didnt watch the first three installments of mad max and i wasnt too enthusiastic with scifi movies though its actually not i just prefer more realistic movies however after i finished fury road i enjoyed it very much  fury road barely has a plot its actually very simple the characters travel from a to b then returns to a however its the visual effects that explain the whole story of fury road all of the little things in the movie are made delicately and is designed uniquely this highlights that things can still be beautiful even though its set in a wasteland i can guarantee that everything in the movie is exclusive and cant be found in any other movies  the character development in fury road is done extremely well though there is not much on the talking throughout the movie you can see the development through their decisions actions and even through their facial impressions and thats what makes the characters stand out because every character has their own personalities  i have nothing to doubt on the credibility of george millers directing its incredibly and beautifully filmed in most action movies that i have watched most of them failed on using shaky cam which is just a lazily filmed technique used in action movies however in fury road you cannot find a bit of shaky cam every shot is either filmed from a distance or set in a point it not only highlights the massive view but clarifies on every action of the characters  the sound effects sound magnificent just by themselves its explosively loud but in a good way though its filled with heavy metal it applies to the soundtrack extremely well  overall mad max fury road is action packed and explosively stunning fury road is so beautifully filmed that its close to flawless this is absolutely a masterpiece constructed by director george miller
Jul 1 2015,positive,edge of the seat movie completely crazy  completely entertaining
Jul 1 2015,positive,not much plot but a fantastic spectacle all the same
Jul 1 2015,positive,nipple clamps 1010 would see again
Jul 1 2015,positive,rating based solely on the actionvisuals overall film is 3 out of 5    the good  action packed great visuals detailed costuming and no screen time wasted would have been good to watch in imax 3d    the bad   plot is thin and should have been called mad maxine as charlize theron is the true star of the film max does not have his iconic vehicle nor a vehicle of his own in the film     the ugly   mel gibson was mad tom hardy is just max hardy mainly grunts through the whole film like encino man the guitar playing goon left me scratching my head
Jun 30 2015,positive,the action scene is packed in the movie with lots of cool sequences the story is interesting enough to want to see the next one
Jun 30 2015,positive,better then the original
Jun 30 2015,positive,pretty darn good and best movie so far of 2015 and one of very best in past two yrs  the lets turn around part was quite predictable though  or would have been a 10
Jun 30 2015,positive,i thought this was a action packed movie with a very average story hardy  theron were awesome and the guitar playing freak rocked dont expect anything deep but the action is intense and fun
Jun 30 2015,negative,awful  its depressing to think that a lot of people found this entertaining  a plot written by and for 10 year olds and chase scenes through a cgi desert  how could it get any worse than this
Jun 30 2015,positive,just what the doctor ordered spot on plot and terrific remake finally someone figured out how to do a remake awesome film
Jun 30 2015,positive,cannot possibly recommend this movie highly enough there are no words witness me
Jun 30 2015,positive,hardy theron and even hoult are are fantastic in this beautifully directed shot and edited action flick that all other action flicks should strive to be as good as
Jun 30 2015,positive,amazing action movie definitely one of the best in years
Jun 30 2015,positive,mad max fury road is the 4th installment in george millers critically acclaimed action franchise understand my apprehension the phantom menace kingdom of the crystal skull etc    theres something different about mad max however namely i thought the first mad max was good but i thought the masterpiece known as the road warrior was a bunch of crap an unpopular opinion i know but mad max 2 made me mad enough to skip number three for the preservation of my sanity    for those who arent familiar with mad max you might get even more enjoyment out of fury road than i did and i loved it it feels like its own animal with only tangential relations to the 30 yearold films the energy of this film is like injecting premium gasoline into your veins the premise straightforward and engaging everything i was told the road warrior would be    although the movie is light on plot theres enough substance to string you along for the ride allowing for involvement that is sorely lacking in the average fare of this variety this film is electric and offers nothing short of utter exhilaration and wonder a true treasure the crown jewel of its creator
Jun 30 2015,positive,its an oldschool action packed movie where crazy people live up to the fullest
Jun 30 2015,neutral,i liked the second half
Jun 30 2015,positive,interesting visuals good action weird story should give it a try
Jun 30 2015,positive,amazing fusion of old school kick ass explosions cgi done properly and a gritty storyline with memorable characters its a must see really really liked it
Jun 30 2015,negative,youre kidding me right  nonsensical utterances and confusing backstory make this a complete waste of time and money  ive pooped better movies than this and they all lasted a lot shorter
Jun 30 2015,negative,really  did these people see the same move i did  you have got to be kidding  a waste of 90 minutes of my life
Jun 30 2015,positive,wheres the max good movie but missing development on max character
Jun 30 2015,positive,if you want to see a movie with 0 plot but a ton of action that some how keeps your attention this movie if for you the entire movie has no real plot or substance but hey it looks amazing and has amazing action
Jun 30 2015,positive,postapocalyptic perfection
Jun 30 2015,positive,whilst fury road is an entertaining ride with jaw dropping effects and visuals the film lacks in heart and doesnt really allow you to care whats happening its very good dont get me wrong but i dont think its a 5 star film as many have suggested  you can call me elitist but i value substance plot character development over style flashy effects camera work
Jun 30 2015,negative,you gotta be fucking kidding me how did this get such good ratings  like a dystopic cinematic opera fury road is a road to nowhere going quickly but slowly with lots of gunshots and fucking weird shit happening at every turn  and tom hardy just broke into a banevoice to say what was probably supposed to be his most memorable line about hope and fixing whats broke no idea     im just going to say go see it only if you have no expectations no desire for story or resolution as you watch  an hour and a half into it youve got characters making a plan to end the film at which point it gets exciting again and shit starts happening again but by this time who gives a shit  now its a bunch of old ladies the golden girls trying to reach the best place left for humanity     im going to stop now this is all a crock of shit and i have no idea what the fuck is going on whats worse i dont give a single shit   its the end of the world people let the fuck go and say good night    im out
Jun 30 2015,positive,i dont feel like writing a review cause there is too much to say just watch it more than once
Jun 29 2015,positive,first of all charlize theron is the real star of this movie  her character is somehow more interesting than the title character      second tom hardy is not mel gibson  his mumbling delivery of lines is illsuited for this role  he delivers dialogue with this bored look on his face and he does not convey the inner turmoil with his eyes that gibson did so well    last but not least the movie felt like a twohour long road runner cartoon with roughly the same amount of character development from the looney tunes shorts  example the heroes are played by beautiful people and the villains played by the not so beautiful      once again director george miller changed the causes of the apocalypse to meet the latest threat of the day    kudos for a decent score and action sequences
Jun 29 2015,positive,all those descriptive words youd use to for a great summer action movie apply here but this one is such a step above what weve been served in recent years the use of stunts with very minimal cgi enforces the believability of what were being shown and makes me reconsider our over reliance on it nowadays fantastic thematic design and brilliant performances from the cast means i left the theatre one happy chap
Jun 29 2015,positive,one long chase movie with more imagination  ingenuity in the first 12 hour than avengers  furious7 put together
Jun 29 2015,positive,mad max fury road is probably the most fleshed out action flick ive seen in quite a while it goes beyond action alone and even develops an enveloping narrative and story told mostly through its visuals some details are given through dialogue and it combines with the visual storytelling to make for an incredibly realized world the actors are all pretty good in their respective rolls with one or two exceptions for some particularly cheesy acts from the wives and they all contribute to the feel of the film the action is the most fantastical stuff youll see for a while stealing most of the show its all done for the most part without the assistance of cgi so it feels more real and gripping knowing this is all happening and not an illusion   another thing that makes this movie great is the character imperator furiosa even though max is arguably the main character its definitely furiosa that steals the show she does most of the badass stuff throughout the film while max acts as a second wheel no pun intended and because of this the films becomes a welcoming feminist entry into the action genre without a dolled up character  in short this movie is definitely worth the time and money heres hoping the sequel is just as good
Jun 29 2015,positive,best action movie in years a must see
Jun 29 2015,positive,the best action movie of all times
Jun 29 2015,positive,so much going on with very little story  i could have used a bit more

Jun 29 2015,positive,very good movie there was a lot of action and it was a bit crazy but still good
Jun 29 2015,positive,good action and very entertaining
Jun 29 2015,positive,a stellar example of well balanced story with the superb and mind blowing action mad max fury road is a showcase of insanity increible writting and intense scenes of action that dont feel gory or dumb the film hits in all the right spots and thanks to its amazing cast and pitch perfect narrative this is one of the best action films of the decade
Jun 29 2015,positive,awesome film doesnt really warrant an r rating only complaint is that it needed some gore
Jun 29 2015,positive,a lot of action not much of a story  mad max if at most only says 50 words the whole movie
Jun 29 2015,negative,no story poor cgi and tom hardy is awful big fan of the previous films though hugely disappointed 
Jun 29 2015,positive,pure insanity fury road manages to pay tribute to past max films while blazing a path of its own
Jun 29 2015,positive,the most intense movie ive seen in years
Jun 29 2015,positive,great addition to the mad max history and charlize theron is well suited for her part as furiosa
Jun 29 2015,positive,words cannot describe the respect i have for this film
Jun 29 2015,positive,beautiful fun and epic this movie had my mouth open for all of the 2 hours it was truly a spectacle and worth several watches to appreciate what miller was able to accomplish i brought my girlfriend who did not even know that mel gibson was the original mad max and she even enjoyed it amazing movie
Jun 29 2015,positive,while its clearly a great film stellar acting very over the top but it worked
Jun 29 2015,negative,horrible zero direction plot was absolute garbage
Jun 29 2015,positive,one of the best action moviesever
Jun 29 2015,negative,i dont get it one long chase scene mediocre at best
Jun 29 2015,negative,not impressed i struggled to find the tie in to the original movies which i liked i cannot tell if this is a sequel a prequel or a remake
Jun 29 2015,negative,no walked out 40 min into the movie
Jun 29 2015,positive,non stop what a great movie
Jun 29 2015,negative,how can a 2 hour film have absolutely no back story and no plot development
Jun 29 2015,positive,this movie from start to finish is pure action  probably the longest car chase in cinema history  i have seen the previous 3 movies if you havent fret not my wife hasnt and she thouroughly enjoyed it  i had to explain that the movie is set in a postapocalyptic world but really anyone could of figured that out  fury road is relentless its insane in a nut shell this is a movie about people just trying to get from one place to another point a to b but damn it  it works  the vehicles are so creative its borderline brilliance  this movie could of been a perfect 10 however not having a nod to mr mel gibson i deducted a point  from my point of view  9 out of 10
Jun 29 2015,positive,surprisingly good movie
Jun 29 2015,positive,george miller is a genuis the only series of films he has ever done fury road is a modern day masterpiece from beginning to end fury road is relentless it brings you into the directors strange post apocalyptic world this film is woman power at the max and so exilerating it is so refreshing to see a film in modern time using practical effects im so impressed words cant describe thought is wasnt going to old up or be different without mel gibson but without a fought this film is extrodinary in every way thank you george miller
Jun 29 2015,positive,i liked it it was really gross at times and a bit unbelievable but it wasnt nearly as farcical as jurassic park still fun to watch with lots of crazy action and so forth its not a perfect fit for me as a film but it was worth seeing
Jun 29 2015,positive,only movie of 2015 i gave 5 so far at some point i asked myself when action and these views of incredible beauty will gonna to stop that was overwhelming i just needed to stop for a moment to take a deep breath superb just superb
Jun 29 2015,positive,one of the best action movies ive seen this is why movies are made to take you to a place thats not reality for god sake there is a dude playing guitar with flames shooting out of it amazing go see this movie
Jun 28 2015,positive,top film held me from start to finish and done justice to the original movies awesome

Jun 28 2015,positive,great movie better score wanted more doof warrior
Jun 28 2015,positive,one of the best and craziest films of all time
Jun 28 2015,positive,what seals the deal here is director george millers ability to subtlely paint a fullyrealized universe mostly with symbols and with minimal dialogue mad max fury road accomplishes what hollywood hasnt done in decades think highly of its audience without sacrificing noisy dirty adrenalinefueled and downright thrilling action sequences
Jun 28 2015,positive,i did not watch the original mad max so i cannot speak on that but what i can tell you that this is a guys movie all the way from fighting for survival to fighting over women to just plain fighting guys eyes will be glued to the screen the entire film amazing character development with minimal use of words makes this film one for the ages
Jun 28 2015,positive,best watched while under the influence mad max fury road achieves the  not really so remarkable feat of being more realistic than most of the fast and furious series if you can get over its utter weirdness and just accept that youll have no idea whats going on youll have a good time
Jun 28 2015,positive,loved it great fun
Jun 28 2015,positive,visuals were insane very different in a good way
Jun 28 2015,negative,boring just one explosion after another
Jun 28 2015,positive,just about worth a three amazing visuals boring people
Jun 28 2015,negative,worst movie ever  seriously at the risk of sounding like a movie snob i am completely questioning the sustainability of the human race when i see that critics give this movie 90 rating and users give an 85 rating  horrible unimaginative story line an even worse script and the by product of the two transparent uninspired acting  my 19 year old son and i kept wondering when the movie was going to get good  finally after enduring the ridiculous exchange between max and charlize therons character about how the others are doing all this for hope and and how shes doing this for redemption we couldnt take the relentless slap in the face of intelligence this movie was dishing out any longer and left at the 90 minute mark  we left the theatre and didnt look back  because cool guys dont look at explosions  anyway hope this helps someone save themselves from throwing their money away on this complete waste of time and effort of a movie
Jun 28 2015,positive,a lot of action but to much nonsense
Jun 28 2015,positive,intense exciting and highly suspenseful mad max fury road is an action blockbuster that offers the mustsee moviegoing experience of the year as far as summer blockbusters go its doubtful that youll come across a film as fun as mad max this year filled with breathtaking action sequences exceptional sets and a talented cast of actors its got everything that audiences could possibly ask for from a summer blockbuster at the same time it also features a powerful performance from charlize theron which is unlike anything shes ever done before however what is lacking is characters whom you truly care about amid the big and loud explosions theres very little character development aside from charlize therons furiousa in a nutshell mad max fury road is a thrilling experience but not the masterpiece that many critics have been hailing it as if youre willing to turn off your brain for 2 hours this is the film youve been looking for see it for the style if you can forgive the lack of substance
Jun 28 2015,negative,nothing but action no plot no story
Jun 28 2015,positive,awesome is the word can fit apt to it nothing more i felt to fit into this film will be one of my favs
Jun 28 2015,positive,awesome visually stunning and the story isnt that complicated but it definitely is something you wont be bored by
Jun 28 2015,positive,an absolutely breahtaking 2 hour long action sequence that barely lets up in a far flung dystopian future the action even allows some great characterisation and acting from the 2 main leads which is all the more surprising considering the nonstop action it is a world i wouldnt want to live in yet i would want to hear more about
Jun 28 2015,positive,absolutely fantastic the special effects were great and the style of the world was breathtaking the story was filled with strong characters and a great plot constant meaningful action perfection
Jun 28 2015,negative,overrated and action is mediocre
Jun 28 2015,positive,was really good great watch
Jun 28 2015,negative,maybe you can enjoy this one if youre braindead if not you will struggle to watch past the first 30 minutes  they should apologize for the entire movie
Jun 28 2015,positive,i think i may like it again if i saw it again but on first viewing its great for the first halfafter that it felt too samey
Jun 28 2015,positive,so are future hasnt changed since the 80s then still looks like a select few have massive cars trucks and bikes to drive around excellent
Jun 28 2015,negative,i would wrather pour liquid hot magma down my asshole than see this movie ever again
Jun 28 2015,positive,the narrative power comes not from the main plot or the dialogue but through a unique and exciting brand of visual storytelling seldom seen since the days of silent cinema teamed with the kind of eccentric anything goes action you expect from the franchise
Jun 28 2015,positive,all i got to say is    wow
Jun 28 2015,neutral,one long drive hollow
Jun 28 2015,positive,dystopian at its best george miller revives his eccentric series with a gritty feel good flare
Jun 27 2015,positive,thats one hell of a road
Jun 27 2015,negative,cool action ridiculous movie
Jun 27 2015,positive,pedal to the metal from start to finish
Jun 27 2015,positive,a logical extension to babe pig in the city also hoping for a dystopian junkyard aircraft in the sequel
Jun 27 2015,positive,lots of action and anarchy
Jun 27 2015,positive,loads of fun and almost nonstop action
Jun 27 2015,positive,plenty of gasoline plenty of bullets plenty of water plenty of breast milk convenient
Jun 27 2015,positive,i really loved how this film played great homage to its original  but i am disappointed in how there was no back story since they did skip the first mad max  i feel also that tom hardys talent was wasted since he barely had any lines in the film  charlize theron had by far the leading role which wasnt bad because she did an amazing job  it was just a little surprising  other than that it was a top notch film with stunning visual effects
Jun 27 2015,positive,one of my favorite movies of all time
Jun 27 2015,positive,the most metal experience of my life to date cant wait for more
Jun 27 2015,positive,really stressful episode of scrapheap challenge
Jun 27 2015,positive,this movie is missing all the things a good movie should have for example the plot is confusing and doesnt totally make sense  plus its totally predictable with little to keep anyone interested the characters arent developed and theres little in terms of relationships between them i wouldnt say the acting is bad there just are very few opportunities for acting since the dialog scenes are few and far between maxs character has no personality to speak of hes not likable admirable or even empathetic theres really no reason to root for him or even hope he makes it so basically when i think of all things i look for in a good movie this has none but i liked it im not sure why but i did one thing is that is a very visually cool film as a person who couldnt care less if i ever see another car chase the one in this film held my attention does it make sense to have a crazy guy playing a flame throwing electric guitar on the hood of vehicle in the middle of high speed chase across a desert no but it does look pretty cool the costumes and make up were creepy disturbing and interested enough to keep my attention also interesting that i wouldnt call max the main character of this film charlize therons character is really the protagonist she might have many as 20 lines in the whole movie all in all its entertaining and worth watching
Jun 27 2015,positive,stop what youre doing and go see this movie every frame is a masterpiece i loved every minute
Jun 27 2015,positive,a solid 10 movie well balanced and let us know that max isnt the only hero in the world
Jun 27 2015,positive,the first mad max movie in 30 years this has a new actor in the lead role no longer is mad max played by mel gibson but instead we have the character portrayed by tom hardy    remember mad max 2 the road warrior  remember how it ended with the tanker chase sequence    well its almost as if the entirety of this movie is based around that with the entire thing pretty much one extended chase sequence    there are some spectacular scenery show and lots of completely overthetop vehicular carnage with lots also being made of the feminist subtext of the movie  in fact i think its a fair point to say that the movie is more about charlize therons furiosa than about max himself    i do have to say though that i found it quite hard to make out what immortan joe the main villain was saying most of the time due to that mask over his face    definite winner for mostbonkersmovieoftheyear in my book
Jun 27 2015,positive,to anyone who sees this film as an unnecessarily excessive car chase or overdone and lengthy action scene you have never understood any form of poetrypoesy from the vehicles weapons scenery all the way to the extras it is all subtle symbolism
Jun 27 2015,positive,loved this movie was action from start to finish i was locked in the entire time hope they make many more must see
Jun 27 2015,positive,would watch over and over like i did with the road warrior
Jun 27 2015,negative,a visual operaepic hellbent on shocking its audience with grotesque depictions of postapocalyptic society its inhabitants and its environment while violence and explosions are never absent mad max is more concerned with charlize therons character than anything else in its limited plot
Jun 27 2015,negative,following a nuclear war the world has become a desert wasteland and civilization has collapsed max tom hardy a survivor troubled by those he couldnt save is captured by the war boys the army of the tyrannical immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne and taken to joes citadel designated a universal blood donor max is imprisoned and used as a blood bag for the sick war boy nux nicholas hoult meanwhile imperator furiosa charlize theron drives joes armoured truck to collect gasoline when furiosa drives offroute immortan joe realizes that his five wiveswomen selected for breedingare missing immortan joe leads his entire army in pursuit of furiosa calling on the aid of nearby gas town and the bullet farm nux joins the army with max strapped to his car to continue supplying blood a battle ensues between the truck and joes forces furiosa drives into a sand storm evading her pursuers except nux who attempts to sacrifice himself to destroy the truck max escapes and restrains nux but the car is destroyed after the storm max sees furiosa repairing her truck accompanied by the wives capable cheedo toast the dag and angharad who is pregnant max steals the truck but its kill switch disables it max reluctantly agrees to let furiosa and the wives accompany him to the alleged freedom from immortan joe    first of all it needs to be said that my 9 year old me still remembers the movie stills outside the movie theatre when mad mad 2 the road warrior came out in 1981 i was too young to see it at the movies some year later i managed to see the film on vhs and my mind was blown as this was by far the most intense gripping violent and unique action movie my eyes had seen so far in life the rawness the tension the music the cinematography was so different from everything i had seen before it became a favourite movie in an instant and so did the character mad max and not that far from this moment i managed to see mad max as well banned in sweden at the time and my mind was blown yet again as this was even better then mad mad 2 the road warrior george miller had managed to create something so unique in all areas of this film with no budget at all i salute george miller for that the film mad max is an action milestone with many layers and i can see it over and over again and then i mean the original version with australian accents i resaw the third installment mad max beyond thunderdome some weeks ago and my opinion about it hasnt changed its weak and wasnt supposed to be a mad max movie from the start anyways and that shows all too well it starts off ok but midways it dips and theres no rescue for max left behind in the desert mad max and mad mad 2 the road warrior are on my top list of best action movies ever made and that will never change with this intro i wanted to state that i have a truly personal relation to mad max and the three movies from 19791985 its inevitable that my opinion about mad max  fury road is coloured when i red several years ago that george miller wanted to do a fourth one with mel gibson i was uncertain already then why whats the idea whats the concept the production was infested by problems and years passed mel dropped out and it looked like it would never been made then suddenly it rose like the fenix from the ashes tom hardy was suddenly connected to the max rockatansky role and it felt it might work great actor with a strong cv was george miller actually up for making another mad max movie after having been away from it for 30 years the primary theme of mad mad 2 the road warrior and mad max beyond thunderdome was survival and as well a global collapse and moral decadence a state of the globe that pushes people into all sorts of mayhem and violence to posses power and gasoline themes that somehow will always be current and close and i reckon that we all fear that we might see this collapse in a near future other themes is solidarity home and redemption mad max  fury road carries more or less the same themes and george miller seem to not be able to get enough of these specific themes but thats ok those themes are worldly and constant what we get in mad max  fury road is a pumped up steroid like hollywoodized action spectacle that seems to be built on a sentence or two making george miller look like a sugarhigh kid with too much money in the pocket to go bananas with something he once created out of nothing to become something amazing a nothing that became a template for how to make a great action movie with no budget in mad max that became yet another genre milestone in mad mad 2 the road warrior that then became something less intriguing and more abstract in mad max beyond thunderdome some say that george millers postapocalyptic franchise has been kickstarted back to life via mad max  fury road while i on the other hand say it stears it into a speed bump pushing the car right over the edge and crashes with a loud roar the stunts and the choreography might be of high standard and more or less cgi free but when the substance is lacking the action cant make up for it both mad max and mad mad 2 the road warrior had great storylines in comparison wheres the rawness and uncompromising direction from mad max and mad mad 2 the road warrior wheres the fantastic music from the previous films wheres the characters you actually believe in despite the slightly cartoony tweek wheres the actual feeling of reality in the insanity as we see in both mad max and mad mad 2 the road warrior mad max  fury road is such a postapocalyptic cartoon explosion of a desert western with extra everything and over the top times ten it makes you tired both in the eyes and in the head i dislike the rehash of the crazy convoy chase from mad mad 2 the road warrior but this time around with a different load i dislike what george miller has done with max as the main character why is he even in the film is a riddle as he is more or less just a backdrop max seems to just be an excuse to make another action film i dislike tom hardys approach to the max character with grunts as the main vocabulary he doesnt come close to the magic and charisma mel gibson had i dislike the whole immortan joe universe and his war boys i dislike that charlize theron doesnt manage to convince me full on of her character imperator furiosa i dislike that george miller doesnt handle the feministic approach of the story in a proper way as that becomes also way too cartoony in my point of view i dislike the fact that the script seem to have been written on a whim and outlined to sort of fit with current topics as an excuse to blow up new stuff i truly dislike the over the top ridiculous flamethrowing guitarist i dislike that the acting is mediocre at its best i dislike the cartoony character development if you even can say there is some sort of character development i dislike that george miller has adapted the movie to being more international and not using the australian heritage and accent anymore in a proper way mad max  fury road makes no sense in my book and for me the mad max universe disappeared in that desert in mad max beyond thunderdome and was never seen again
Jun 27 2015,negative,the worst film of the year a long drive in the desert its boring
Jun 27 2015,positive,its a mad mad mad mad world max is just living in it well existing in it by his own admission survival is the one instinct that he  the last sane man in a world gone crazy  has been reduced to as he wanders through the postapocalyptic wasteland in mad max fury road the fourth in a film series that hasnt revved its engines since 1985    the real madman is producerwriterdirector george miller mad for deciding to pull his long dormant road warrior out of retirement 30 years beyond thunderdome mad for conceiving the sort of world that heretofore could only have existed in a truckdriving anarchists worst acid trips and finally mad for pulling it off with the sheer mindshredding gusto that filmmakers half his age he recently turned 70 consistently struggle to inject into modern action movies    best not to stand up right after seeing this one itll melt your bones from the inside    those unfamiliar with the original mad max trilogy need not dismay those films had little in the way connectivity treating their eponymous antihero more as a figure of legend than as a continually developing character besides miller tells you everything you need to know about the franchise within the first five minutes of fury road    nuclear armageddon has rendered the planet a balding desert  the sands of namibia standing in here for the outback of millers native australia  where warring tribes do vehicular battle over water and gas the only commodities of value max tom hardy stepping into mel gibsons leg brace and onesleeved leather jacket sides himself with no tribe instead roaming the abyss alone evading marauders and fleeing the ghosts spirit guides perhaps of innocents hes failed to protect    yet trouble always has a way of finding max who is captured at the outset by the cultist war boys of immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne a fearsome czar who lords over the masses of his colony with ironjawed authority joe sends out a war party led by bigrig driver imperator furiosa charlize theron to bring back supplies unbeknownst to him shes smuggling a valuable cargo    it doesnt take long for furiosa to be found out in a storm of fury immortan joe hits the road a fury road if you will with his convoy of death machines in tow and the chase is on max is just a prisoner reluctantly along for the ride until circumstance forces him into an uneasy alliance with the renegade imperator who ends up pulling far more than her own weight in this unlikely heroic partnership perhaps a more appropriate subtitle for the picture would have been the fast and the furiosa    though what amounts to a 2hour car chase may not exactly be high on concept the simplicity of its narrative belies what is actually an exemplary worldbuilding screenplay the locales and characters of millers vision are steeped in details that are never formally explained but merely revealed with the trust that audiences can soak them in and figure them out as they go    miller knows that idiosyncrasies such as kamikaze war boys chroming themselves or a flamethrowing guitar soloist atop an ampmobile or any other tidbit best left to discover on ones own would not benefit from verbal exposition but in visual context everything we see from the largest set to the tiniest prop is of a piece with his demented hellscape    as if all that wasnt bonkers enough for you the tangibly dangerous action scenes  principally achieved through heartstopping stunts and practical effects  make it clear how this movie could only have been made by a madman but evident in that madness is such meticulous method that fury road rises well above the throng of bombastic summer blockbusters    good action movies often get chalked up as editing achievements  granted margaret sixels footage assembly here is whiteknuckle stuff  but theres something to be said about the way an action movie is shot that often goes unheralded the way images are composed to fit multiple layers of activity in frame yet without becoming the cinematic equivalent of a 12car pileup see avengers age of ultron is a fine art that hearkens back to the days of buster keaton whom miller has cited as an influence on his mad max endeavours    the well advertized shot of max swinging atop a metronomelike pole whilst vehicles barrel roll and explode behind him is just one example of how miller and his cinematographer john seale himself a man in his seventies maintain the films visual assault without sacrificing coherence as well seale  who won an oscar for capturing the tunisian desert in the english patient  lends surreal beauty to this stark and violent landscape with scorching oranges and chilling teals albeit helped along by extensive postproduction colour tweaking    if youre the sort of person who really needs your movies to be about something more than mere spectacle there are a few thematic oases to latch onto amidst the sensory onslaught you could say its a film about the dangers of blind fanaticism given face by a disillusioned war boy named nux nicholas hoult or you could look to its unmistakable feminist edge and say its a film about running over the shackles of male oppression therons gritty star turn as furiosa deserves to join the ranks of ellen ripley and sarah connor as the most badass heroines in the genre    but lets not kid ourselves the spectacle is what this movies all about and when its delivered as imaginably as cleverly and indeed as crazily as miller does the only proper way to appreciate it is to sit back buckle up and revel in its glorious madness
Jun 27 2015,positive,a movie with heart  great acting and script  superb editing and music  terrific ending
Jun 27 2015,positive,this movie is the best chase scene ever made
Jun 27 2015,positive,completely satisfying awesome action and story
Jun 27 2015,positive,it was everything you want to see and more it was fantastic i was on the edge of my seat from beggining to end truly a work of art
Jun 27 2015,positive,if you havent seen the originalsit leaves you a bit lost
Jun 27 2015,positive,more than any other genre of film i am a fan of action films the most this is one of the best action films in decades everything blends together so well the musicvisualscharacters and the easy to understand plot i went to see this film 2 times in the theater and that is rare in my caseif you want a great experience in entertainment media today do not pass on this film you will regret it
Jun 27 2015,positive,its a fun actionpacked ride nothing spectacular about it hardy is underutilized
Jun 27 2015,negative,hated it weird load of rubbish
Jun 27 2015,positive,wow more directors need to take advise from this gem of a movie i would give it 10 starts but i can only give it a 5 must watch
Jun 26 2015,negative,i felt like the whole time i was watching this that this needed a lot more action for what it was worth the stunts and acting were great  but the film is called mad max for a reason max only says at best maybe a dozen lines and thats about it he doesnt do anything nearly as crazy as we had hoped if they try to make another film in the mad max series after this film they really need to step it up
Jun 26 2015,positive,nux oh what a day what a lovely day    mad max fury road is a remake of the 1979 mel gibson film mad max which is also directed by george miller unfortunately i havent yet seen the original but seeing fury road really makes me intrigued to do so its one of the few great action films ive seen in a long while its wild and loud and almost never slows down     from what ive been told fury road is similar to the original but its not a complete remake george miller wanted the film to stand alone as a unique work theres no doubt about that fury road is stunning it boasts absolutely outstanding visual effects a lot of which are practical effects incredible action and some trippy kubrickian aspects     the film opens with one insane sequence of violence and disturbing images it lets you know what youre in for the story never slows down and most of it is full of action but the moments that arent do not feel boring the story is nothing to go crazy about but its interesting enough besides thats not what this movie is about its about the excellent showcase of visual effects and action sequences i can quite honestly say its one of the greatest action films ive ever witnessed     back to the kubrickian aspects the opening shows max being captured he receives carvings in his back showing information about him blood type sex race etc later on we see nux one of the battle craving mindless superstitious warriors taking blood from max what i instantly noticed was how none of this is directly told to us we just see it all occurring at once were in the midst of it its awesome it really is the action is breathtaking loud and really fun    the action is better than in most other films and theres a reason for that theres purpose to it theres style all of the battles are just as awesome to see as they are to think about especially because the combat takes place mainly on vehicles this allows for some epic explosions theres shots of bikers jumping over cars throwing grenades inside theres giant poles that people climb onto to reach the subsequent vehicle this is all so cool to see and to hear fury road is an action movie to the bone and one of the best to be released
Jun 26 2015,positive,not bad  exciting from start to finish
Jun 26 2015,positive,this movie is a 55 not because it is perfect or the best movie of the year but because it does every single thing you would want out of a mad max movie plus so much more i expected a crazy action movie but this was beautiful an incredibly realized world and completely compelling despite the plot not being too deep just a super fun movie to watch
Jun 26 2015,positive,good effects cool and crazy action movie
Jun 26 2015,positive,its more like a 485 stars this is one of the best action movies of this summer and best action movie i have seen in a long time  not really any story  but the action is none stop and amazing besides the action charlize theron and nicholas hoult are the best parts of the movie   are the best parts
Jun 26 2015,negative,second movie in my life that ive walked out of way too bizarre and dark for me
Jun 26 2015,positive,full of action but did need more of a story tom hardy and charlize theron are great in this movie
Jun 26 2015,positive,as good as any of the others
Jun 26 2015,positive,this movie was pretty cool visually but otherwise fairly monotonous definitely a mustsee if youre a road warrior fan it was definitely charlise therons movie though  it really should have been called mad maxine
Jun 26 2015,positive,best film ive seen in ages gripped from start to finish
Jun 26 2015,negative,boring tedious and poorly edited when will this end when will this endcould this be the worst movie ive ever seen
Jun 26 2015,negative,this was a video game remake and tragedy of a great movie franchise where was the script and story line great graphics and violence seem to beat out actually creating something of substance
Jun 26 2015,positive,literally a nonstop thrill ride with only two small breaks to catch your breath artistic and visually pleasing
Jun 26 2015,positive,when i watched this movie i felt my heart pounding and the action effected me like that the stunts sets and costumes in this movie are just incredible no actor felt out of place this nonstop movies leaves you full of adrenaline and amazed when it ends after two hours
Jun 26 2015,negative,great cinematography sound and unreal special effects  no story no character building
Jun 26 2015,positive,loved it max a secondary character in the story of furiosa but frankly that made it all the better mad fun violent and a rollicking night out
Jun 26 2015,neutral,it certainly mad max  very modern take and great action scenes  mr hardy dons a mask again
Jun 26 2015,positive,best example of the perfect blockbuster
Jun 26 2015,positive,having gone into this without thinking too much about what to expect i was pleasantly surprised about how well executed it was the acting was solid from all however i did feel that tom hardy was perhaps lacking through no fault of his own i like him as an actor however the portrayal of max was basically just grunting on a pretty face nicholas hoult stole the show for me with his role as nux i found myself watching him intently in ever scene he appeared in forsaking all others    the film was action all the way delivering some cool explosions and bodies flying through the air    would recommend to anyone who has or has not seen the originals
Jun 26 2015,neutral,action packed nice explosions i guess after watching the original many years ago this one just didnt live up to mel it is definitely worth watching though
Jun 26 2015,positive,the fact that the critics gave this movie a 98 and the audience a 89 yet the identical received measly ratings tells me that americans dont want dialogue good feelings they want non stop action this movie didnt have a story or character depth it was a pissed off gory guy trying to get back his stolen wives thats it a huge car chase throughout the whole movie you like mindless high energy video games then this movie is for you
Jun 26 2015,positive,pleasantly surprised
Jun 26 2015,positive,george miller is a genius  mad max fury road is one of the best most creative and epic films ive seen in a long time its easily the best action film in decades the directing acting cinematography music all work in a symphonic precision to deliver one of the most fun and enveloping cinematic rides ive ever experienced and i love movies if you couldnt tell yet and i love big movies but so many big movies are brainless and forgettable not this one george miller knows his format with an insight shared by few in his industry these days and this film is a brilliant showcase for a faceted career in storytelling on the big screen it literally is a moving picture show and i hope that this film serves to reinvigorate an interest in audiences to see practical special effects and real stuntwork in hollywood films you cant beat the real thing and this film is a real movie did i mention yet that george miller is a genius 
Jun 26 2015,positive,oh my i thought how can this have such great reviews but it really delivers total non stop chair gripping excitement and several fun nods to the first mad max worth seeing imax and 3d dont wait for this to come out on disc
Jun 26 2015,positive,this is probably one of the best movies ive seen in a while just realize that this is an action movie and there is intended to be little to no plot involved if you can come to terms with this then youll find yourself engrossed in every single shot while anticipating the awesomeness of the next if you cant come to terms with this then i feel very bad for you
Jun 26 2015,negative,could have been a great film if it wasnt for the buy one get three mentality of modern hollywood     where was the big explosion killing nux and the pursuing war party where was happy ending with a view of life after taking the citadel these loose ends will be tied up over the next couple of years through a series of increasingly frustrating disappointments    the lord of the rings was naturally okay as a trilogy the first matrix was great as a single film so who cares if the producers then cash in on couple of lame sequels  at least they delivered one good one hunger games is beating down the divide between movie and soap opera where as mad max feels more like a vanilla audi it looks the part but really its just an empty box and youll soon want to buy something else    if we take the whole upcoming mad max trilogy or however many it is they plan to spit out of the sausage machine then condense them into one 253hr film then it would probably be worth the 98 fresh rating sited above so i will divide the 98 by 3 to result in a meager rating of 30
Jun 25 2015,positive,perfect action wonderful direction practical effects a definite must see
Jun 25 2015,positive,mad max cool film enjoyed it
Jun 25 2015,positive,melted my face off definitely go into it with an open mind
Jun 25 2015,positive,i love how a veteran such as miller beats the modern action film at its own game it makes this even sweeter a success than it already is otherwise     despite being very action heavy the spectacles in the film actually had weight to them and didnt feel diminished as most films in the genre have been guilty of thats because theres one crucial element missing from you average fast and the furious avengers and expendables fare character development mad max fury road shows that you can have all the action youll ever want but give a damn about the characters too every character undergoes a sort of change and all of them feel incredibly real and integrated into a fullyrealized world the female characters a major reason why many are giving mad max so much praise are treated like the guys they arent hitting the audience over the head with the overdone bad ass woman trope but rather simply developing them as much as the rest of the cast so i dont see mad max as a feminist film really but simply put a film thats successfully driven by actual fully fleshedout characters something unfortunately very rare today
Jun 25 2015,positive,the choreography and editing in particular are so wellorchestrated that the action is boiling but never bewildering and that is one of the elements which makes mad max a joy to watch the other is the great writing that cares about all of its characters as human beings thinks good looks good is good
Jun 25 2015,positive,geroge miller returns with an epic continuation of the mad max franchise its a movie about survival in millers beautiful visualized postapocalyptic world this really is a great refreshment to all the other so called action movies nowadays     its a crazy ride of insane realistic and unique action at a grand scale it got its classic moments with many references to the previous films especially when it comes to the cinematography and the visual effects which all are stunning its beautifully shot the plot is extremely entertaining and the best aspect is the surprises throughout the film so many crazy ones this truly is an epic postapocalyptic film and it really is my favorite movie so far of 2015     its a bit overrated though due to lack of long term entertainment when it comes to the actionsequences but also because the movie didnt fit me to a 100  everything else though is epic wonderful and touching music great characters chemistry spectacular action at a massive scale and a villain so great and so terrifying and mysterious that he might be one of the best ive seen the movie did satisfy my expectations but its a bit overrated     8510
Jun 25 2015,positive,an amazing refreshing action movie composed of practical effects and clever ideas one of the only movies where i felt it necessary to see twice in theaters however i felt max was a side character in his own movie maxs involvement in the film was seemingly by mistake and one might as well call the film mad joe furiosa road despite that though it is definitely worth the watch if you want to see a good action film and not a bythenumbers super hero flick
Jun 25 2015,neutral,scenes take place to get you from one action piece to the next
Jun 25 2015,negative,just another action packed film one time watch only
Jun 25 2015,positive,if you loved the original or enjoy destruction and chaos in a postapocalyptic world you are going to love this
Jun 25 2015,positive,i loved that this movie was not really about max but about furiosa instead i think she is a good character to add to the mad max catalog strong woman with feminine qualities
Jun 25 2015,positive,in a future world where civilization has descended into carnage within a small settlement a skirmish breaks out    i have to confess to not being a fan of the mad max series perhaps now is time for a reappraisal  few movies that i know are so polarizing than this series many movie aficionados truly adore the original mad max series beyond the cult status that it already has amongst fans the original series has a reverence for anyone who grew up in the 80s almost as a symbol of a simpler time  i myself have memories of staring at the mad max movie posters in my youth and marveling at the art work and trying to fathom how tina turner fit into this rather odd package  a package that starred a certain mel gibson an absolute super star of the 80s and 90s and had names like road warrior and beyond the thunderdome and was titled mad max to boot mad max  imagine how that must sound to a 9 year old in the 80s      equally their are many movie fans who i know that have never seen this series or have a certain ambivalence to it  acknowledging the spectacle but not quite invested in the world    now to drag a story further i remember a certain time in the early 90s when the original mad max trilogy was shown on tv it might have been on bbc2s moviedrome series with the director alex cox providing a suitably cinefile intro  well i remember the excitement in my house when my older brother stayed up to watch and record the first mad max movie on the vcr well i was too young and was not given the privilege of staying up late so relied on my brother to watch it and give me a suitably in depth update the next day  by this point my brother had already developed his sci fi fixation the original terminator had already come on weeks before and im certain in mad max he was expecting something of the same ilk  well the next day i asked him how mad max was and his response was i stopped recording half way through confused i pushed for answers why  well i cant remember his words verbatim but it was something along the lines of low budget nonsense  and thus was my impression of mad max for the next 20 years  without having seen the movies proper the die was cast in my head every time i saw a flicker of mad max on the telly all i could think of was low budget nonsense    now with the release of fury road it is time for me to reassess my opinions of this series and readdress an oversight that my brother failed to address in his first viewing all those years ago  from my understanding of mad max as a phenomenon what one must appreciate about these movies is the intelligence that runs through them  mad max movies particularly road warrior are different from standard hollywood blockbusters in that they do not follow the same constraints as their american counter parts  whereas most movies demand a central character who is at the heart of this world and somehow able to change and influence it mad max merely exists in this world  alone in pain and disconnected  the series doesnt attempt to throw light or resolve the problems that plagues this future waste land the characters are only a small part of a grander stage  to appreciate this stage is to understand mad max and possibly a route into loving it    fury road follows the same path as the original series in that it is suitably cast with a circus of freaks has a bewitching landscape that almost hypnotizes the eyes and does not in anyway provide any answers to what is going on in this post apocalyptic world  what is does have is a compelling action set piece that pervades through the whole movie and somehow through this one set piece everything we need to know about this world is unveiled      now heres my theory about mad max what some people love about it is the same thing others find off putting about it  whilst many marvel at the sparsity on screen others find this empty whilst some find the sm costumes and diesel engines a turn on some find it cheap and distasteful  some people feel the post apocalyptic world is not fully rendered some say this is all that is required to understand the movie    i am of the opinion that mad max is as perfect a movie as it needs to be  whilst i confess that i am not quite bowled over and a fully fledged fan of the series i will say that i appreciate the craftsmanship that is put up on screen  the artistry of colours and light that is embed in every scene of fury road tells us so much more than a simple exposition would  and even though by the end of this movie there is a sense of what happens next going though my mind there is also a sense of mission accomplished as i realized that for almost two hours i have stared wide eyed at what is the richest and most real depiction of a future society in modern cinema    when taken on its own merits away from the previous mad max series the movie stands out as a piece of sheer action fueled mayhem the likes of which we dont often see except for of course in other mad max movies
Jun 25 2015,positive,i found it entertaining i still love the originals
Jun 25 2015,positive,so i exist in this wasteland reduced to one instinct survive
Jun 25 2015,positive,the most action of action films i have seen in my whole filmwatching life stunning special effects and a great world created to the minute detail i appreciate they avoided putting too much existential drama or moral stories into it which could easily be done and didnt try to make it anything more than an action film   very violent be prepared to spend the first 10 minutes getting used to it
Jun 25 2015,positive,as of now this is the best movie this year the action and the stunts are perfect more than making up for the minor weaknesses in the story tom hardy does a great job as max whatshisface and has great chemistry as the female lead while people call this movie feminist i wouldnt say that the women are simply displayed as strong as men and the movie isnt making a big deal ive seen it two times and i would gladly watch it a third
Jun 25 2015,positive,i really enjoyed this lots of non stop action edge to your seat
Jun 25 2015,positive,omg this movie was amazing like really amazing this was the best mad max ive ever seen in my life like the new mad max blown my mind great movie i just love it
Jun 25 2015,positive,even though im not into vehicular destruction this movie is truly fast and furious it could have use more character development and i wish max was at the forefront of the story overall one of my favorite post apocalyptic movies
Jun 25 2015,positive,super stuff all round very entertaining and exhilarating
Jun 25 2015,positive,better than i expected actual stuntmen did some of the amazing stuff
Jun 25 2015,positive,what a outstanding film was nervous about this remake but it really was excellent
Jun 25 2015,positive,so good incredible in imax 3d
Jun 25 2015,positive,fast action movie great for the mad max fans
Jun 25 2015,positive,so much testosterone it was a none stop thrill ride through the dessert great action sequences and while it was over the top it made sense and i didnt get tired of it as someone who hasnt seen the originals i was mostly able to follow why things were happening some questions were there about a few things but it didnt interfere with the film looking forward to checking out the old films and learning more about the mad max world
Jun 24 2015,positive,the plot gets out of the way for the action which isnt a bad thing when choreographed this well production values are amazing when you think of all the vehicles they had to create and destroy
Jun 24 2015,positive,most insane action movie to date i know thats a big statement but ive seen plenty to defend it from the ridiculous vehicle designs to the costuming joes mask wtf  to the overthetop chase scenes thumbs sky high for miller showing the young bucks in hollywood how its done what a return for the mad max series i literally wondered am i really seeing this a half dozen times
Jun 24 2015,positive,to be honest i didnt find this film to be that great at all seriously im not saying that its bad or anything that is terrible that would put off viewers here i also happen to be a person who enjoyed the original mad max films starring mel gibson that launched his career as an actor here is an actor tom hardy whom weve seen in many other movies since the early 2000s or so i think i think hardy is not yet ready to take over gibsons max yet and besides he doesnt get much screen time or get to know more of his character instead the film tricks us most of the time on us seeing his hallucinations and fantasies about the people who he didnt saved or helped especially his family that is much better told even brutally on the 1979 mad max film we then instead had charlize theron who is the more main character in the film than max himself and the other women and nux all are searching for redemption and hope but i wish the film deeply explores that and inspires many other people who survived the movie then spends more time on the road with other pirates with hummers jeeps cars chains guns blade wheels and even a flamethrower guitar indeed it is a big question to the audiences on how did director george miller made all of those stunts on the road my other main issue in this film is not like the other max films this one purely feels small and low budget i just dont know why but if its bigger and still concerns to the story and to the characters then its still a lovely day right again im very upset about giving this a low rating not because i didnt felt excited after but its just too little too late
Jun 24 2015,positive,as intense as the original films an absolute nonstop thrill ride george miller really understands how to tear you out of reality and bring you into his dark twisted wasteland of a nightmare
Jun 24 2015,positive,very far fetched but action packed surprised me that i liked it so much but to me mel gibson will always be mad max
Jun 24 2015,positive,mad max fury road is probably the best summer blockbuster in years filled with totally insane stunts actionsequences hot cast charlize theron being hotter then ever  and nonetheless quite emotional tom hardy and  charlize theron almost tearing up the screen with adrenalinefueled performances   george millers longawaited sequel is indeed a masterpiece  if you put iit n scale of 110 in average it surely does manage to get over eight and overall it brings a new flavour to the classic mad max series of course mel gibson was great no doubt but so is hardy
Jun 24 2015,positive,a cat and mouse chase for 2 hours straight still wont bore you
Jun 24 2015,positive,an awesome movie although it may look strange it was great it was different but very interesting and appealing
Jun 24 2015,negative,it is the stupidest movie that i have ever seen
Jun 24 2015,positive,non stop action without much of a plotbut who cares so much enjoyable action
Jun 24 2015,positive,theres not a bad thing i can say about this film
Jun 24 2015,positive,great and entertaining a bit confusing if you didnt have the background info great effects make up and set designs
Jun 24 2015,negative,words cannot begin to describe how the undertones of social justice warriors ruined this movie
Jun 24 2015,negative,while it has its moments it feels largely like a poorly constructed cartoon the dialogue is either boring or blatant trailerbate the cast is directed with complete incompetence although the actors themselves do their best to resurrect the film the aesthetics are overly indulgent the story is barely present and the narrative is shuffled
Jun 24 2015,positive,slept on it 5 stars it is havent seen such a pure action movie in years
Jun 24 2015,positive,everything a blockbuster action movie should be
Jun 24 2015,positive,best action film i think ive ever seen not only that it is up there with my all time favorite films it has amazing acting terrific action set pieces fast paced never dull and a depth that i really connected with i really felt for the characters it has an epic scope that could match that of star wars and lord of the rings great writing fantastic narrative and edge of your seat thrilling deals with themes of desperation right and wrong and survival emotional as well which i wasnt expecting loved it
Jun 24 2015,positive,awesome well orchestrated action a variety of female characters great story want to watch again
Jun 24 2015,positive,there are some really impressive set pieces but the film essentially just repeats itself three times and the ending is pretty blah
Jun 24 2015,positive,amazing effects still dont understand the story now
Jun 24 2015,positive,great action and just as sadistic as mad max can be
Jun 24 2015,negative,not worth your time
Jun 24 2015,positive,i really enjoyed mad max fury road its a flawed action masterpiece where all the things wrong with the movie get blown away by the sheer amount of action stunts and kinetic energy technically flawless and aesthetically gorgeous it rarely pauses the 2 hour non stop vehicle chase so in the end you might not even want another 20 minutes of in between characterization or an ending that doesnt seem extremely rushed and a bit anticlimactic i would still give this movie 5 stars were it not for that guitar playing
Jun 24 2015,positive,now i need to wait a minute for my heart rate to return to normal
Jun 24 2015,positive,the amount of action in this movie is absolutely incredible
Jun 24 2015,positive,the bloodpumping thrilling action and awesome effects are great to see but the weak plot and lack of depth in each character weakens the potential of what this movie could have been
Jun 24 2015,positive,wild berserk awesome in its absurdity everything i expected and more
Jun 24 2015,positive,some of the most inventive action sequences i have seen in a while need to watch a second time to appreciate the actual storyline and the world these people inhabit
Jun 24 2015,positive,by far the best movie ive seen this year mind blowing visuals great action scenes and great performances by tom hardy  charlize theron alone make this movie worth it
Jun 24 2015,neutral,big budget hokey cgi mess was there a story there
Jun 24 2015,negative,we seen this and wasnt impressed mad max was not the main character and the stunts ive seen better at the circus men on sticks all about women being objects for men from mothers milk to beautys for breeding so stupid i wanted to gag
Jun 24 2015,positive,it was amazing and terrible it had phenomenal chase scenes and too many chase scenes it had bad dialogue and really bad dialogue that left me cringing and slightly uncomfortable for the rest of the day it is not a thinking mans movie but a primitive part of me liked it a lot
Jun 24 2015,positive,witness me bloodbag
Jun 24 2015,positive,bane is back is this fantastic batman sequel rightfully taking place after he blows up the football field in the third movie
Jun 24 2015,positive,one of those rare films that gets better with each viewing  deceptively smart and progressive wrapped in a heart pounding chase
Jun 24 2015,positive,very good movie the directors made the action sequences are very well done
Jun 24 2015,positive,one big action sequence to the maxit never really lets upset pieces and design are first ratenot much in the way of storyline or dialogue to quench the thirst for itgood but not great
Jun 24 2015,positive,non stop action except for a few slow parts it was action packed and non stop car chasing in the post apocalyptic and droughtinfested world that has no water or sane people plenty of freaks for you freakshow lovers and charlize theron had a wicked kewl stump of an arm
Jun 24 2015,positive,quite possibly the best action movie i have ever seen
Jun 23 2015,positive,extreme action flick
Jun 23 2015,positive,super highoctane action flick  very little cgi plenty of strange vehicles and characters spectacular chases and battles and a simple coherent plot to hold it all together  a refreshing change from superhero movies
Jun 23 2015,positive,with overthetop stunts good themes right performances bizarre characters and eccentric designs this film is impressive and exhilarating
Jun 23 2015,negative,just another car chase in the desert very disappointing a big bore
Jun 23 2015,positive,loved this film from start to finish
Jun 23 2015,positive,what a film just wow by far my favourite film of the year   its fallout and borderlands on guzzoline
Jun 23 2015,positive,very intense enjoyable movie for such a straightforward quest of heading from one location to the end of the line and back there was a surprising amount of character development the world itself is so well developed and rich with details that im looking forward to more mad max stories max as a character reminds me of artoo and c3po in the original star wars in the way they interact with the main protagonists and participate in the action going on in the world around them they are thrust into the center of an epic struggle resulting in a permanent shift in power or other meaningful change in their world and all theyre trying to do is survive this is one film im looking forward to seeing at least one more time to absorb more of the details of the world
Jun 23 2015,positive,mad max is a guzzeline charged rush of a movie i enjoyed it far more than i was expecting to as it proved to be far more intricately woven than its testosterone filled preview suggested the acting was on point and the cinematography helped make the experience
Jun 23 2015,positive,well the forth in the mad max saga is the best lets start with that props to george miller for holding out and finally getting a budget and time to realise his world  max has been caught by a desert overlord and is being used as a blood bag for one of his minions when said minion takes him on the road in pursuit of one of overlords leaders gone rogue max joins with her in pursuit of some redemption  its basically the same shebang but with a bigger budget max has never been a particularly fulfilling character in his eponymous series and here the focus is taken off him to charlene therons character furiozasp   tom hardy is great as max tbf but this is all about her journey   so for a film about female empowerment i thought there could have been a bit more women kicking ass i felt a little let down in that vein and the film does have a saggy middle   all that said though it has some masterclass action scenes and ooh a plot its a great popcorn film and a half totally recommend like totally
Jun 23 2015,positive,i really liked the action and the settings they were amazingly captured and also the characters were very well realised especially imo nux and of course max
Jun 23 2015,positive,i was a little skeptical at times but overall its very much worth the time and money to see it on the big screen ive never seen the original however remake approved visually thrilling and surprisingly well executed
Jun 23 2015,positive,as someone who has not grown up with the previous mad max movies i can only comment on the spectacle and immense visual effects displayed in fury road while light in dialogue each characters actions and emotions display the fervor and energy of the land they inhabit a great action movie
Jun 23 2015,positive,im not usually a fan of overly stylized movies but this one was near perfect the steampunkeque setting was the perfect backdrop for an exciting extremely well paced movie that doesnt give in to the norm or play by the rules the performances are all excellent but the true star of the movie is the incredible design that takes what could have been a dull action movie and excels it to a much more beautiful place i dont usually say this but i hope there is a sequelprequel in the works this is one of the spate of reboots that actually works brilliant
Jun 23 2015,positive,awesome movie action all thru the movie
Jun 23 2015,positive,best action film in the last 10 years easily
Jun 23 2015,positive,fighting in cars i liked charlize theron before but i love her now as the kick as furiosa what a world george miller has created best movie so far this year easily
Jun 23 2015,positive,the best action movie so far this year
Jun 23 2015,positive,while it is packed with action packed car chases fights and stunning cinematic vistas this film also does a great job of filling out the backgrounds of the characters during the film at times it has a theatric feel to it with soliloquy like moments and at others it is a chaotic circus you really feel you are in the truck with max as he along with furiosa leads their group on a quest for a better life
Jun 23 2015,positive,epic and thrilling and way underrated  do yourself a favor and see it  even though there isnt much dialogue there is amazing storytelling going on that will require you to use your brain to figure out
Jun 23 2015,positive,excellent entertainment too bad mel wasnt includedcameo
Jun 23 2015,positive,anyone who told george miller to maybe tone it down a little there was fired
Jun 23 2015,positive,guess this is among the movies which become cult classic even before they get released and why not the movie is revolutionary in terms of action once there was matrix which revolutionized stylized action mad max revolutionizes stylized raw action  there is no action movie like it
Jun 23 2015,positive,dont know what surprised me more how insane this movie was or how many times i want to watch it and replay certain scenes it lived up to everything the trailers claimed and so much more
Jun 23 2015,positive,a singular film overthetop and crazy in the best ways possible thrilling relentless and riflevision focused on constantly showing us things weve never seen before in films
Jun 23 2015,positive,this is much better than any movie i have seen in a long time
Jun 23 2015,positive,such a great movie  the effects were amazing  the story line is terrific  acting is awesome  the overall feel of the movie is super unique and captivating  some of the characters will haunt your daydreams while others will enchant you  i loved it
Jun 23 2015,negative,awful reboot save your time and money and watch beyond thunder dome
Jun 23 2015,negative,endured 20 minutes and had to stopnot my thing
Jun 23 2015,positive,highoctane relentless fun  uber shoutout to the art and stunt departments on this badboy
Jun 23 2015,positive,my world is fire and blood
Jun 23 2015,positive,my favorite action movie this year even over the avengers and jurassic park action from beginning to end
Jun 22 2015,negative,just a really really really long car pursuit
Jun 22 2015,positive,george millers reintroduction of the postapocalyptic bmovie franchise soars high and above expectations with huge and boisterous set pieces dedicated performances and earnest storytelling mad max fury road is a modern cinematic triumph
Jun 22 2015,positive,this film is proof that people need to quit doing reboots and remakes period either come up with a fresh sequel or leave it alone and come up with a fresh idea i think that were all tired of hollywood constantly pumping out unoriginal cash grabs it was refreshing to see such a good sequel after 30 years since the last installment also this film is action done right all of the action sequences were filmed flawlessly the hero was constantly in peril there was just enough plot and character development to keep the audience interested this is the must see of the summer
Jun 22 2015,positive,boring very repetitive driving and driving and shooting if you take some time to analyze the movie and relate it todays issues in society the movie is a masterpiece but i wouldnt watch it again
Jun 22 2015,negative,worst movie yet without any plots only thing memorable from the movie was constant action and grotesque portrait of the postapocalyptic future of human race
Jun 22 2015,positive,beyond brilliant defo an add to my movie collection no need for gibson 
Jun 22 2015,negative,very ordinary indeed not even a good action flick
Jun 22 2015,positive,who would have thought
Jun 22 2015,positive,with exhilarating action and a surprising amount of narrative heft mad max fury road brings george millers postapocalyptic franchise roaring vigorously back to life its all perfectly wonderfully fantastically crazy mad max fury road will leave you speechless which couldnt be more appropriate words are not really the point when it comes to dealing with this barnburner of a postapocalyptic extravaganza in which sizzling unsettling images are the order of the day amidst all those ingenious powerpacked road warrior sequences fury road contains a surprising amount of depth and character development mad max fury road will leave you speechless which couldnt be more appropriate words are not really the point when it comes to dealing with this barnburner of a postapocalyptic extravaganza in which sizzling unsettling images are the order of the day millers not interested in character development plot twists or social commentary with one possible exception he wanted spectacular stunts which he achieves with tremendous skill and a badguysvslessbadguys pursuit that goes through countless exciting permutations from its very first scenes fury road vibrates with the energy of a veteran filmmaker working at the top of his game pushing us forward without the cheap special effects or paperthin characters that have so often defined the modern summer blockbuster maxs reenfranchisement is a triumph of barkingmad imagination jawdropping action crackpot humour and acting in the face of a hurricane     verdict highquality stuff  positive reaction this is a rating to a movie i view as very entertaining and well made and definitely worth paying the full price at a theatre to see or own on dvd it is not perfect but it is definitely excellent films that are rated 35 or 4 stars
Jun 22 2015,neutral,graphics were good story was lacking was expecting alot more from the franchise
Jun 22 2015,positive,i respected more of the films aims than i was entertained by the film itself i would have to say that i was more interested in director george millers ideas more than anything else such as what rosie huntington whiteley one of the wives of immortan joe said the theme that women are more than just things for the pleasure of men and also the culture surrounding the war boys and joe giving them a higher calling and something more to believe in tom hardy and charlize theron give superb performances in the movie and just gel so well together in addition nicholas hoult famous for playing beast in the last couple xmen films was given a nice character arc and a cool role for the movie there is also plenty of jawdropping action throughout the movie including at least 6 or 7 holycrapworthy moments however i would have liked it even more if miller focused more on those ideas hes playing with in the film rather than show more and more carnage and almost 200 ways to kill people because it was a bit too gruesome for me it knocked down a film that could have been pretty great to merely good enough  it is still a film worth seeing if you can stomach the violence
Jun 22 2015,positive,insane special effects with no cgi god bless george miller and god bless america
Jun 22 2015,positive,i was a big fan of gareth evans indonesian film the raid as well as its sequel despite the fact that there was really not much to it it was an action film in the most basic sense of the word an exercise in pure unbridled adrenaline now what would you get if you took that film and refined it a bit namely by shoring up the characters and the environments    youd get mad max fury road    the latest entry in george millers australian apocalyptic saga comes 30 years after the last picture 1985s mad max beyond thunderdome and has a new lead actor but it hasnt missed a beat like the raid its a straightforward action film with a barebones plot but the character work gives it that extra edge miller has populated his movie with a whole roster of quirky memorable misfits and though its true that this is a sequel in a preestablished franchise the only recurring character is max himself its kind of impressive that with each new film the inventive miller creates a new batch of wacky supporting characters for his stoic lead to interact with    taking over for mel gibson tom hardy stars as max rockatansky the embattled road warrior who like john mcclane always seems to find himself in the wrong place at the wrong time in the desolate postapocalyptic australian wasteland max cruises the roads with only one thought on his mind survival in millers warravaged universe the road gangs have taken over much of the world and the ultimate prize is gasoline this has already been established in prior mad max films but the beauty of them is that they all function as standalone films as well as sequels you can walk into fury road having seen none of the earlier entries and you wont have to worry about being lost    as with the previous films max finds himself in hot water with one of these gangs warlords this time its the hulking immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne who incidentally also played the lead villain albeit a different one in the original mad max who runs a dictatorial reign over a city that seems to have been carved from the sides of mountains through a series of unusual circumstances max ends up on immortan joes bad side when he inadvertently aids the fierce warrior woman imperator furiosa charlize theron in liberating five of joes female slaves his breeders joe wants his women back and all hell is about to break loose on what remains of the australian highways    its a simple story but its masterfully executed and it serves mostly as a clothesline for some sensational action sequences whereas the raid focused on martial arts millers specialty is the car chase and like previous mad max film the road warrior he constructs some humdingers here for me to say that is really saying something because the car chase is one of the most overused clichés in the action genre if youre going to employ one youd better do something unique in order to hold my attention miller manages to do so and with multiple car chases theyre the backbone of the mad max franchise and somehow four movies and 36 years later hes still finding ways to impress me    in fact probably the vast majority of the movie takes place in a moving vehicle and the film never gets boring its a whiteknuckled thrill ride throughout the special effectsmostly practical as opposed to cgiare fantastic but because the characters are offbeat and memorable we really care about the outcome of these insane car chases    theres an argument to be made that its actually imperator furiosa who is the main character here and max is more of a sidekick max has always been a man of few words and that trend continues here its furiosa who is the more galvanizing of the two the one who makes the call to action and shes just as much of a badass as he is if not more evidently this has become a source of concern to some of the more misogynistic movie goers out there but these people are cretins the common link in each movie has been max but with the exception of the first movie hes almost always come across more as support its never his plight that the movie is focusing on rather he always finds himself dragged into other peoples situations in this instance its furiosas    the only way i wouldve had a problem with this is if the actress was not up to the task but theron makes a morethan convincing action heroine theres a fierce determination in her eyes and voice and its not hard to see why shes both feared and respected in this dystopian universe additionally tom hardy makes a splendid max make no mistake these were big shoes to fill before mel was riggs he was max and it was going to be difficult to find a suitable replacement hardy is up to the task he definitely has the right physicality for the role but hes also capable of displaying maxs inner turmoil with little more than a grunt and a rueful stare max is a wounded person for reasons i wont reveal here and though it seems at first glance like an easy role to play theres a bit more depth than people may realize i also rather enjoyed the offthewall performance of nicholas hoult as nux a fanatical follower of immortan joe hoult has established himself as one of the more talented actors of his generation warm bodies xmen first class and xmen days of future past    ive always been a fan of action films and its encouraging that i saw fury road so soon after john wick another recent example of the genre that took a clichéd foundation and did something creative with it these movies prove that filmmakers dont always have to reinvent the wheel especially when you can find different things to do with itlike maybe rip somebodys face off  oh what a lovely day
Jun 22 2015,positive,this movie rocks its a movie that proves you can have literally nonstop action and still tell a really good story i thought the story was on point and it never faltered there was a surprisingly very strong emotional core throughout as well the movie never feels too long and its not too short its the perfect length  the acting is very good as well tom hardy does a good job as the lead role charlize theron is fantastic as furiosa she has a lot to do and she handles it masterfully nicholas hoult is also very very good his character has the best arc and i just loved his character for me he stole every scene he was in  i loved this movie and with its strong characters great acting fantastic filmmaking beautiful cinematography and great story this movie is one of the best of the year and a great time
Jun 22 2015,negative,i really dont understand where all of the praise for this movie is coming from  the movie is a 2 hour long desert car chasebattle with near zero plot  the action is cool for the first 10 minutes but then quickly becomes repetitive and mind numbing this gets even worse when the second half of the film turns out to be the exact same thing as the first half of the film just in reverse  some cool concepts are teased but absolutely nothing is fleshed out in anyway  im not sure what i want more my 13 dollars back or the 2 hours i spent mostly bored out of my mind
Jun 22 2015,positive,max returns with a vengeance  the cars are gased and the guns are loaded the end is here
Jun 22 2015,negative,do yourself a favor and do not go see this movie  it got so far of the track of the road warrior plot that it seemed to get lost in a whirlwind of wierdness  the main actors didnt get a chance to talk enough especially max to develop their roles  the guy waited until the very end to even introduce himself  strange plot kept getting stranger  must miss
Jun 22 2015,positive,mm fury road is a good movie if it wasnt mad max related i was so excited for this but was unfortunately let down 3 stars for the make up look action and top notch car sequences i thought with george miller behind this yet again it would be something special i thought it could have been a graphic movie they finally had the budget for it it was gritty but not gory i wanted both i also felt like these women wouldnt kick all these guys asses is george miller a feminist now it sure felt like it they also didnt wrap up the film with the fate of a main character did you edit the wrong part out miller tom hardy was meh ill take mel any day charlize was awesome though i think they didnt have enough development for mad max either i guess thats what the next 4 sequels are for ugh
Jun 22 2015,positive,fun yes one of the best movies ever fuck no
Jun 22 2015,positive,really enjoyed it tom hardy was excellent in the of mad max
Jun 22 2015,negative,basically a 2 hour car chase very boring
Jun 22 2015,positive,mad max is awesome i mean sometimes its best to put things in the simplest terms i may change this to a 5 star rating after i see this again because i was very impressed however i saw this film on my iphone which does this movie absolutely zero justice  this movie has about as much dialect as cast away but blows you away with its special effects anf incredible action i really enjoyed mad max and look forward to seeing it when it comes out on bluray so i can get a better experience see this in theaters if possible
Jun 22 2015,positive,so much visual storytelling and minimal dialogue this is what cinema is all about
Jun 22 2015,positive,this is everything an action movie should be mad max fury road has fantastic practical effects a hero that is actually in danger and adrenalinepumping action sequences what a lovely day indeed
Jun 22 2015,negative,i dont understand all of the positive reviews of this film  have these reviewers been bought  this film was just one huge chase scene with very little dialogue or plot and was a complete wast of tom and charlizes talent  two hours ill never get back
Jun 22 2015,negative,relentless is the only way to describe it
Jun 22 2015,positive,this installation into the mad max franchise was exactly what it needed to be it used max as more of a plot device that allowed us to see the crazy world he lives in and observe new characters while still seeing max do his thing and rehabilitate from the state he was in at the beginning of the film the practical effects mixed with the cgi worked very well together and the performances were spectacular
Jun 22 2015,positive,glorious action absolutely worth seeing in dbox for the full experience
Jun 22 2015,positive,this film is riveting and stunning however i do wish it was less noisy and made a bit more sense plotwise
Jun 22 2015,positive,omg this long chase through the desert is never long enough i didnt want the screen to turn black and to get out of the cinema nooooo this is to make you understand how great this movie is top performances from the whole cast
Jun 22 2015,negative,they spend half the movie driving somewhere and then the other half driving back
Jun 21 2015,positive,this movie was incredible amazing action scenes amazing scenes all over the environment is incredible and very mesmerizing this movie alone was a game changer for me by far the best movie ive scene in a long time the story was scripted perfectly the acting is on point theres really no reason not to watch this movie
Jun 21 2015,positive,visually stunning and true to its predecessors in the franchise george miller delivers
Jun 21 2015,positive,i thought mad max fury road was visually astounding and that charlize theron was an amazing protagonist i understand that action fans appreciate that it jumps right in and is nonstop until the end however i think there is about 20 minutes too much car chase maybe its estrogen making me say that but heres the truth i fell asleep about 23 of the way through just so much chasing and so much dust and explosions and it got very repetitive and then i just kept nodding out i woke up and got interested again when they finally returned to the citadel i found maxs character to be utterly uninteresting i didnt see the original mad max movies and so maybe i was missing the joke or something but i just didnt love it like the other folks i saw it with did just sayin ex machina is still my pick for best scifi movie of 2015
Jun 21 2015,positive,mad max fury road is one heck of an action film that does not stop until the very end with terrific performances from nicholas hoult tom hardy and charlize theron it is a nonstop thrill ride of pure madness
Jun 21 2015,negative,terrible movie would not recomend there was little to no plot the cammeras did funky things that made it hard to follow and the whole concept is just stupid the only good parts of this movie is the musical score and tom hardy would not recomend
Jun 21 2015,negative,2 hours of chase scenes ugh
Jun 21 2015,negative,i got caught up in the tidal wave of good reviews i hated the first one and i hated this one theres no reason for any of it a bunch of idiots in stupid costumes chasing either other around in the desert trying to kill each other without much rhyme or reason some fat guy impregnates sandycunted supermodels tom hardy looks at a baldandangry charlize and people are just teatsuckle on the overwraught emotional depth shutttttt up hated it luckily i was sitting near a pretty girl and my bff and had no sleep and a plane to catch and it was the only air conditioned place in the middle of the searing heat of summer in las vegas i guess im really not the demographic for this movie as i hate remakes and anything postapocalyptic but god i hated it
Jun 21 2015,neutral,lots of action but in the end no real reason to care if any of them lived or died with the original you cheered for max here he was just another guy speeding across the wasteland trying to stay alive i was disappointed in that aspect the cinematography was wonderful the chases exciting the characters lackluster at best
Jun 21 2015,positive,favorite film so far this year
Jun 21 2015,positive,awesome movie great action
Jun 21 2015,positive,visual effects just wow fast paced and action packed movie moved along at a wonderfully entertaining pace and was violent but in a surprisingly balanced and interesting way though for me a touch ott at times but i not really a fan of gruesome special effects or extended car chases movie was a bit light on plot and character development  but still managed to deliver an enjoyable and engaging viewer experience despite a very scant amount of dialog multipleunclear references to redemption huh and some verb improbably ridiculous subplotty twists an unfortunate pitfall common in this type of movie but i did like that most of the women in this movie were tough af  strong female representation was refreshing and so very welcome especially for this genre of movie well done ps  does anyone make movies anymore that do not scream sequel pending at the end auggghhh
Jun 21 2015,positive,brilliant is the only word to describe fury road best action film ive seen ever and i watch a lot action films two just last night saw fury road today
Jun 21 2015,positive,very good but storyline could use a little more work
Jun 21 2015,positive,its intense and nonstop action the thrill ride never stops its a story of survival and hope
Jun 21 2015,positive,practical effects and wellchoreographed scenes gives an otherwise average story a nice visceral edge
Jun 21 2015,positive,atmospheric action beauty must see theatrically
Jun 21 2015,positive,i never thought you could have so much in a movie about crossing the desert in a truck
Jun 21 2015,positive,excellent movie thrilling
Jun 21 2015,positive,terrific action packed thrilling ride
Jun 21 2015,positive,very entertaining mayhem
Jun 21 2015,positive,good high action popcorn movie  parents need to take the rating seriously though
Jun 21 2015,positive,in the deserts of a dystopian postapocalyptic world an escaped prisoner gets caught up in a royal escape in the exhilarating thrill ride that is mad max fury road a followup to the mel gibsonstarring trilogy from the 1980s fury enlists the help of george miller who directed the original films as well as tom hardy and charlize theron as the leads who play the protagonist max rockatansky and rebel warrior imperator furiosa respectively the film centers around a supply run gone awry as furiosa smuggles the five wives of the supreme military leader immortan joe to rescue and return with them to her homeland as fate would have it max ends up in the middle of everything and joins forces to escape the clutches of the crazed joe and his army of war boys halfdead beings    what fury does particularly well is it keeps the audience engaged there is not one scene in the film that feels like a wasted opportunity and while theres walltowall action there are plenty of more subdued scenes that also work well the amount of stunt work is probably equal to the cgi both of which are really impressive and the cinematography adds another layer of brilliance to the film in terms of acting theron delivers a standout performance and she really becomes her character in a believable way hardy also does well even with limited dialogue but in the end it comes down to the stylized cool cinema that fills the screen during fury that makes it the fun action ride that it is    while it might not be everyones cup of tea mad max fury road is a great soap opera that runs on dust and motor oil and makes a great case for reviving the franchise for a few more lovely days on the road
Jun 21 2015,positive,fine action film that virtually ignores characterization and plows thorough at full throttle  offputting and disturbing sequences abound  not for kids  i liked it but didnt love it
Jun 21 2015,positive,everything ive ever wanted in a movie two thumbs up
Jun 21 2015,positive,one of a kind a perfect mad max movie incredible action and story line
Jun 21 2015,negative,terrible reboot of a classic trilogy the most over hyped falsely advertised film in history of cinema you know the world is in trouble when a movie like fury road is the best cinema has to offer you these days audiences of today could care less for a good story with character development and would rather just sit back and watch two hours of explosions with no real impact behind them characters are killed brutally but we no nothing about them so why should we care about their demise why should we care about this one dimensional character called max who is nothing but a generic action hero who takes a back seat in his own film why should we care because the explosions are pretty pathetic
Jun 21 2015,positive,action packed with some great sequences throughout and a unravelling plot that keeps you hooked till the end
Jun 21 2015,negative,this was an awful experience  acting was poor and the underlying theme was not subtle
Jun 21 2015,positive,absolutely one of the best movies of the summer
Jun 21 2015,positive,i have seen a lot of movies but none quite like this pure carnage through and through a shame just a little more story and a little less madness could have done wonders but the novelty amazing road action and awesome soundtrack were enough for me to somehow still enjoy the movie it was just that crazy
Jun 21 2015,positive,feministic undertones aside this movie is a blast  with kinetic energy to spare and a slew of gloriously constructed action sequences done with a refreshingly small amount of cgi mad max is the quintessential modern action flick      4 12 stars    jt
Jun 21 2015,positive,best movie ive seen this year it had great action sequences and it really built an amazing postapocalyptic world
Jun 21 2015,negative,looks like a live action version of the game rage visually its fantastic but its as shallow as they come tom hardy is a great actor but hes not mad max also the idea that this is a feminist film is utter nonsense given that the majority of the women in the film ie the wives look and dress like fashion models on a location shoot if you want a couple of hours of mindless well filmed action scenes masquerading as something more this is the film for you you might like rage too if you want an actual plot with real character development best look elsewhere
Jun 21 2015,positive,delivers what it promises it is a petrol headed action movie the sequences are pretty awesome
Jun 21 2015,positive,pretty decent movie i didnt like it as much as the originals but it was a very good sequel especially for one that was made 30 years after the originals the movie had great action and great acting but in terms of the story i didnt think it was as imaginative but it sure was an entertaining movie to watch
Jun 21 2015,positive,where is the 1973 ford falcon xb gt coupe police interceptor not enough it  wtf come on i like the movie the only good thing about it   is the cars thats it the actors ok director could of slowed it down a bit and tap into how the world got this point  characters are good but the movie is ok im a big fan of mad max grew up watching all first three movies so i will stick with the old and and enjoy the visual effects of the new
Jun 20 2015,positive,loved the action one giant road battle but kept your attention
Jun 20 2015,positive,the visuals were stunning on a continuous basis this made up for the tedious plot which never really grabbed my attention nonstop violence  choreographed like a twohour ballet so it never seemed real  almost dancelike i think its visually interesting on a bigscreen so if youre going to see it see in a theater
Jun 20 2015,positive,i can hardly wait to see it again george miller has topped himself several times over with this spectacle 150 million was the budget and it was all put right on the screen in a long procession of action incredible vehicles demented characters and mind boggling stunts and visuals anybody who wants to complain that it didnt have much of a plot should stick to books because they are not understanding or appreciating that this is a visual medium and that miller has upped the ante for how action  adventure flicks should be shot tom hardy makes a great max and charlize theron is every bit his equal as furiosa a character i hope well see again in future films just see it
Jun 20 2015,positive,one of the best movies ive seen in a long time
Jun 20 2015,negative,this movie was terrible the movie attempts to tell most if any back story during neverending and intense action sequences with characters who you can barely understand as a result you really dont know whats going on or why the characters are doing what theyre doing until theyre done doing those it i was really shocked it had such high ratings i dont think it was just me other people in the theater were yawning laughing i suppose if youre braindead and you like action without plot or story then youll love this
Jun 20 2015,positive,roller coaster from start to finish hang on to your butts
Jun 20 2015,positive,ok expected much more with the ridiculous critic score
Jun 20 2015,positive,best movie i seen in over a year action pact and solid acting bravo george miller
Jun 20 2015,positive,normally i dont go for these type of moviesbut this one was so creative   1 f bomb  congrats for not throwing that one around all the time   it had humor amazing stunts and i loved that women rule
Jun 20 2015,positive,when i watched this movie i was going in with no knowledge of the mad max movies previous of this one this movie is very entertaining with car chases and explosions and strange looking characters this movie was a lot of fun watching
Jun 20 2015,positive,i will personally carry this film through the gates of valhalla
Jun 20 2015,positive,now one of my favorite movies ever made
Jun 20 2015,positive,even after seeing inside out a close second mad max remains my favorite summer movie so far go see this movie
Jun 20 2015,positive,certainly entertaining
Jun 20 2015,positive,without a doubt the most brilliant mad max film of the series well scripted well directed well filmed and very well acted
Jun 20 2015,positive,a must see film for max fans so good that you dont even care how stupid the concept is
Jun 20 2015,positive,action pack from start to finish gets better each time i see it
Jun 20 2015,negative,boring but interesting
Jun 20 2015,positive,one of the best action films in ages  cant wait to see again
Jun 20 2015,negative,2 hour car chase  unnecessarily violent  maybe 50 words of dialogue
Jun 20 2015,negative,charlize theron and the other guy what the bloody hell does this have to do with anything post apocalyptic just a bunch of girls driving across the desert with spatterings of really nonexistent violence ridiculous to even class this as mad max more like post apocalyptic thelma and loiuse
Jun 20 2015,negative,action was cool but no story
Jun 20 2015,positive,the whole movie was a chase scene and i am perfectly okay with that  not because of chase scenes are cool but because it was a chase scene and i hardly noticed  what a film what a lovely film
Jun 20 2015,positive,most fun ive had in theaters in a while
Jun 20 2015,positive,simple storyline  excellent sets  superb action  easily the best film of the year hands down and that includes the overrated insideout
Jun 20 2015,positive,i thought that it would be a newer version of the classic mad max movies but it was a total remake it was pretty much a 2 12 hour car chase with some crazy stuff in between i liked it but i went in expecting something else
Jun 20 2015,negative,great action scenes great cinematography but boring story line absent relationships and subpar acting
Jun 20 2015,positive,a fun and roaring summer blockbuster george miller delivers one of the fastest and most exciting blockbusters to hit the screen in years between its beautiful and desolate desert cinematography roaring metal soundtrack and action sequences and a nuanced tom hardy performance mad max fury road delivers great entertainment and a better film experience recommended
Jun 20 2015,positive,awesome great action scenes super entertaining
Jun 20 2015,positive,if you want pure and simple action movie search no further this is it action pack from beginning to end btw charlize theron kick ass and she almost steal the show from tom hardy visually stunning with amazing 3d effect so just sit back relax and enjoy
Jun 20 2015,positive,perhaps the best action film since dredd to grace our screens mad max fury road isnt so much an endurance test as it is an endurance marathon a loud screeching unstoppable unshakable engine of violence anarchy destruction action and rollercoaster fun this is the kind of movie michael bay wishes he could even hold a candle too it makes the cgi fest of modern action films look like childs play opting for stunning stunts jawdropping choreography and inyourface violence its nothing but pure genocidal fun which many modern action films think to seem is somehow beneath them fury road shouldnt honestly work in that it seems like any other movie trying to be a nonstop action sequence would be boring but with the capable hands of its cast and crew it somehow avoids that fate by an inch and delivers one of the most thrilling action films in years despite this if anyone tries to tell you mad max fury road has something more than its nonstop violence that it speaks volumes about how max is a true hero or about the inevitable decay of human civilization they must be snorting some kind of pretentious nostalgia dust because thats not even what fury road seems like its supposed to be what it is instead is simply trying to make every minute if not every second hold your attention and it does so with flying colors
Jun 20 2015,positive,batshit crazy but super entertaining
Jun 20 2015,positive,one big fight with charlize theron in the coolest female lead role since the days of sigourney as ripley  my only complaint was it ended a little too quickly but its a very welcome edition to the mad max saga  i can only hope for more  quote of the film witness me
Jun 20 2015,positive,really enjoyed this movie great action sequences which are stand out overall a brilliant movie
Jun 20 2015,negative,it was mehcool highshutter fight with charlize and tommy thought the female characters were cool and the rest just eyecandy
Jun 20 2015,positive,simple story beautifully shot absolutely loved it worth the 30 year wait just get on with the next one otherwise george and i wont be around
Jun 20 2015,negative,fury road is plastic sc fi dross with cardboard cutout performances its one long desert car chase with no plot or dialogue worth worrying about and i am so sick of the tom cruise no facial expression im so serious school of acting replicated by theron dont waste your 15 bucks
Jun 20 2015,positive,not much of a story line but the action is almost surreal
Jun 20 2015,positive,great movie intense nearly the whole time
Jun 20 2015,positive,pretty good action pack but thought it was going to be a remake guess not
Jun 20 2015,positive,lots of berserk powerhungry gargoylelike savages contrasted with normal folks who try their best to survive and princesses who never had a scratch in their pampered lives i appreciated the random spots of humor and thought theron did well in this adrenalinepumping actionhorror movie âmax on the other hand wasnt quite convincing in his role
Jun 19 2015,positive,finally another mad max
Jun 19 2015,positive,pure adrenaline total blast of a movie tense and fast paced with just enough dialog to give you a chance to catch your breath great popcorn flick
Jun 19 2015,negative,what am i missing they drive to one place but the women talks the other women of the man to go to the green place there are creepy stupid people with no hope and nothing to do besides try to look like a zombie then they drive back  try not to get killed okay what was good about this movie
Jun 19 2015,negative,my husband loved this movie and was quite insistent that our sons and i go to see it with him i spent the first 20 minutes or so wishing i could figure out what was going on who i was supposed to care about and wondering if it was going to improve ever there were a few places in the middle of the movie when the incredibly gratuitous chase scene paused and something interesting happened actual dialogue anyone please then it was more chasing more people dying including a couple i actually had started to finally find interesting and finally the movie was over i spent most of the drive home trying to shake myself out of a blue funk and wishing i could have those 2 hours of my life back i wouldnt recommend this to anyone who actually likes plot lines interesting characters or enjoys a bit of humor  none of these things were present
Jun 19 2015,positive,felt like a 2 hour car chase that never felt boring
Jun 19 2015,positive,this one is pure metal from start to finish
Jun 19 2015,positive,from the beginning until the very end mad max fury road managed to deliver one of the most intense and satisfying movie experiences ive ever had i can say that it might be the best action movie ive seen thanks to the ingenious mind of george miller this movie creates an unique atmosphere  and that same atmosphere builds a sheer sense of awe  max comes back as the leading man played by tom hardy he is a man with only one goal which is to survive unfortunately he gets caught by the warboys who destroy the interceptor and take him to a citadel returning once again to the mad max franchise is hugh keaysbyrne who gives life to immortan joe an uncanny and intimidating ruler who reigns the citadel as a godlike figure also he is the leader of the warboys charlize theron makes an unforgettable role as imperator furiosa who has been sent by joe on a mission to collect fuel from gas town however she takes a detour for a personal reason as soon as joe finds out that she took his wives out of the citadel he deploys his forces to retrieve his prized possessions this is when the warboys come in and we take a peek of a sick warboy nux played by nicholas hoult he wants to join the chase but he is very weak so he takes a blood bag with him a healthy person to fill him up that person happens to be none other than max himself who was designated as an universal blood donor  just a reminder this whole sequence was only the setup for the spectacle to come  then fury road becomes a visual feast as one car smashes into another car people get blown up a mad guitarist plays a guitar that shoots fire and a huge sandstorm appears its epic just pure epicness  if i had to describe this movie in a few words id say that it is a relentless orchestra of pure beautiful chaos  despite a minor shortcoming that i can overlook this film is very entertaining with an amazing musical score realistic stunts and visuals mad max fury road is worth watching and it will remain one of the best  may this movie ride eternal shiny and chrome
Jun 19 2015,positive,tom hardy at his best
Jun 19 2015,positive,its better than the original no doubt but im 30 years older now too the visuals of this version match what the original made me feel im happy they made it im not sure itll reboot anything though like the new star trek genre has but maybe thats not the point maybe it was for us genxers simply to feel complete regardless it works
Jun 19 2015,positive,great film go check it out
Jun 19 2015,negative,i thought this movie lacked any character development this made the endless action scenes feel hollow and empty mostly because it was impossible to care for the characters also the design was odd and seemed unbelievable for t  he world
Jun 19 2015,positive,best movie of the year so far visually stimulating great action very original ok story and a little disappointed that theron was more of the lead than hardy but i would see this again
Jun 19 2015,positive,visually stunning if a few notches too grotesque for my liking it felt like fastfurious set in dune with the epic carnage of a chinese war movie which with a onearmed charlize at the wheel isnt necessarily a bad thing the movie is badly named though as max hardly seemed mad throughout the movie and should probably have just be called worried max
Jun 19 2015,positive,with its fastpacing and exhilarating action sequences acclaimed director george miller delivers  a summer blockbuster with a fascinating story line
Jun 19 2015,positive,good and ok but not much of a story line though it was sorta like one big car chase lol good graphics and overall an ok movie
Jun 19 2015,positive,if youre into heavy action with little plot then youll love it however like i said it lacks in the plot department and often leaves you confused or wondering however the action is in your face and very fun but can only take a film so far
Jun 19 2015,positive,was mad  as the title suggests once you get your head round the first 20 minutes and what the heck you are watching it grips you by the balls and doesnt let go     you do have to over look certain bits where you know they would certainly die but you can do this because this film is mental none stop action its a pulsating adrenalin rush that by the end leaves you gasping for breath but whats more
Jun 19 2015,neutral,meh  vehicles were cool though
Jun 19 2015,positive,really had no idea what to expect when i went to see this i walked out of the theatre shaking and grinning ear to ear and saying thatwas amazing yes im a fan of the old ones but this certainly took it to another level of excitement everything about it was so good and i appreciate the minimization of the script not much really needed to be said and any more lines might have ruined it
Jun 19 2015,positive,edge of the seat from beginning to end
Jun 19 2015,positive,greatest movie in the history of cinema
Jun 19 2015,positive,a perfectly balanced action film
Jun 19 2015,positive,theres nothing like it
Jun 19 2015,positive,finally a good reboot on a classic movie series that original star movie that mel gibson tom hardy takes the lead role of max good cast story and director george miller the original directed the original movies for the action movie lovers  this does not let upi would recommend this movie
Jun 19 2015,positive,amazing  went to see it twice already would definitely be willing to pay and watch 3 more times
Jun 19 2015,positive,i always enjoy a sequelprequel that pays homage to the original movie this movie does just that with a new plot line in the spirit of the previous movies the only criticism that i have is this i would have liked to have seen more character development and maybe 10 less minutes of driving i understand the title of the movie denotes a lot of road rage but a few more minutes of dialogue sometime there is such a thing as too much action
Jun 19 2015,positive,get your blood bag ready for a lovely day this is one thrill ride you wont want to miss mad max furry road is an instant hardcore action classic
Jun 18 2015,positive,a lot more depth than i expected a bit long at times and the action seemed a bit forced but i thought the movie was worth the price of admission i believe i got the earlybird rate
Jun 18 2015,positive,mad max fury road is motivated to deliver upon exactly what its promotional materials and the originals suggest and does so with just as much intent as the interesting characters set out on their mission for redemption  director george miller waited years to be able to acquire enough finances to create this vivacious explosive exciting and masterfullycrafted remake of the original road warrior and it shows  no minute of the film is put to waste no detail overlooked no opportunity missed  fury road is entertainment at its finest constructed in a way that almost forces the viewer to appreciate just how much effort is put into the creation of each individual scene  even with shortcomings in character development and backstory that leaves something to be desired its hard to hate on something that knows exactly what its trying to do and does a damn good job carrying it out
Jun 18 2015,positive,cant even begin to say how much i enjoyed this being an original mad max fan this was a generation trip and a half and way better than when the other george decided to get back in the star wars seat miller wins
Jun 18 2015,positive,loved this movie wish max would have played a bigger role
Jun 18 2015,positive,fast pace no down time unexpected
Jun 18 2015,negative,im not sure who the critics are but normal people will not like this movie this movie was 98 percent rotten
Jun 18 2015,positive,mad max delivers on so many different levels brilliant action sequences and visuals including genuine practical effects engaging characters and great performances by those who play them fantastic direction with both story and framing and originality especially for a franchise film fans of the original and newcomers to the series will enjoy this visually stunning and gripping film from beginning to end and leave hoping more of its kind will be on its way
Jun 18 2015,positive,warning every movie you see after mad max fury road will be a complete and utter disappointment  if you see one movie in your entire life then it needs to be mad max fury road
Jun 18 2015,negative,this movie is whats wrong with cinema today  all visuals crap plot riding on the success of its predecessors and too much money spent on explosions i used to like charlize theron not any more this film made michael bay films seem reserved and subtle and passive i want my two hours back

Jun 18 2015,negative,bigger letdown than the super bowl
Jun 18 2015,positive,it aint groundbreaking
Jun 18 2015,positive,very action packed but seemed to be all about the chase 
Jun 18 2015,positive,mad max fury road brings the tough hardened maniac back to the big screen for modern audiences obviously mel gibson isnt max in this movie but they dont force tom hardy to be a better max the people who made this movie are aware that tom hardy cant match mel gibsons interpretation of the character so they instead focus on side characters the action and visuals are amazing and surprisingly practical with the only cgi being the setting for some parts overall a satisfying action movie that will leave you entertained
Jun 18 2015,negative,this movie has no plot or relation to the original series whatsoever aside from a few minor references its just a very long long long long long car chase should be called mad charlize
Jun 18 2015,positive,absolute insanity this is a pure pleasure of action and furious insanity in the high definition world of mad max

Jun 18 2015,positive,second movie with tom hardy seen this this and it hasnt disappointed hes an actor who has everything in his locker but this is his at his best full on action what hes does best the movie was a bit slow to start with but once it was in full swing superb charlie wasnt bad either very gritty performance from her too if you havent seen it yet and you grew up with the first mad max films and mel gibson go and take a look it wont disappoint
Jun 18 2015,positive,mad max fury road is by far the best movie of the year and one of the best movies in history of cinemaan insane movie filled with amazing looking actiongreat acting and overall very intensethis movie has it all  everything about the way that the action is directed is perfectall the time the main character is in danger and you never know how it will endtheres a guy playing the guitar during all the actionthats just freaking insane  tom hardy does such an amazing job herehe fits on the movie perfectly and charlize theron is also very very good on the rolealso theres a certain amount of heart to the characters that makes you love them even moreits not just brainless actionit makes sense and its done beautifully  george miller is back to show us how to do action in the best way possiblehe built this movie in practical effects and i appreciate that even morecars flipping and real explosion over the top makes the movie even more insane  i really cant think of a negative about this movie so im definitely going to give it a perfect 55 rating and deservedly so  go see this movie if you still haventi personally cant wait to rewatch it and experience this amazing craziness all over again
Jun 18 2015,positive,taking moviegoers down a maddening furyous road at maximum overdrive this highoctane thrill ride makes for one of the most entertaining popcorn blockbusters to come along in ages like a roller coaster without a brake the gun battles fisticuffs and pedaltothemetal stunts come at you at a fully automatic clip what makes the whole two hours so exhilarating however is how fresh had vital it all feels sure audiences have been down similar third world road wars hell theyve even travelled with a road warrior bearing the same name youve never quite seen anything as entertaining as mad max fury road however with very little dialogue fury road manages to spin an eyepopping postapocalyptic characterdriven tale unlike no othereven its mad max forebears it helps that title notwithstanding the movie proves to be a double act max and furiosa are compelling enough on their lonesome but in teaming up these purposedriven hardcharging people of action theres just as much mystery and intrigue as there is actionand thats a hell of a lot     in this rrated continuation of the postapocalyptic thriller series a nomad named max hardy teams up with a mysterious rebel leader furiosa theron to try and survive in a world in which people fight to the death and oil is the most precious commodity     having already demonstrated himself to be a highly expressive fighting man of few words as the villainous bane in the dark knight rises and as an embattled exsoldierturnedmma fighter in warrior tom hardy perfectly fits the bill saying as much with his eyes as with his right hook likewise charlize theron brings a ridiculous amount of gravitas and grit to his counterpart a hardbitten rebel exhibiting more energy than filmmakers one quarter his age however original mad max director george miller offers up nonstop racecarinthered action full of grit and spit using very little cgi he stages the soupedup car stunts organically indeed it plays out like a 20megaton demolition derby locked in top gear from the getgo 30 years tickded by since the last mad max 1985s beyond thunderdome but he more than makes up for lost time in fact this is really the only chapter that you need to see     bottom line beyond thunderstruck
Jun 18 2015,positive,great action very imaginative lots of fighting  entertaining
Jun 18 2015,positive,crazy exciting and great fun acting was stellar action was go go go edge of your seat definitely a must
Jun 18 2015,positive,good movie enjoyed it overall but it was too heavy on the action there was no break in the shooting chasing and dying it was exhausting to watch
Jun 18 2015,negative,worst movie this year no imagination mel g was not in the movie but thats not the worst part so many pointless moving in the movie stupid story line over doing it with cars make up and to top everything with the lame guy playing a guitar while hanging from some strings while everyone is shooting
Jun 18 2015,positive,a true rollercoaster of a film veteran filmmaker george miller shows us how a fast paced action film is suppose to be made with a straightforward story mindblowing stunts fast paced action sequences and interesting characters this postapocalyptic adventure is never boring and is hopefully what action films will look like in the future
Jun 18 2015,positive,it really is as good as people say it is no shaky cam thank you
Jun 17 2015,positive,its an amazing movie  we never saw yet
Jun 17 2015,positive,i liked this a lot more then i expected love charlize theron
Jun 17 2015,positive,you will shit yourself thats how badass this movie is
Jun 17 2015,positive,my son and i love this movie i liked that they formed their own storyline and didnt use the old mad max
Jun 17 2015,positive,best movies so far this year would see it again â
Jun 17 2015,negative,reasons to never see this movie  1 there were so many explosions that had i walked out of the theater and into a car bombing i probably would not have noticed  2 max was a bumbling idiot that did almost nothing useful or productive in the entire movie one or two small things yes but he spends the first 14 of the movie as a spectator which brings me to  3 this movie could have been made without ever including max it had nothing to do with max as mentioned above he did nothing really useful and he was almost the flattest and most emotionless character in the story  4 it has little to do with reality or frankly physics at one point there is a dustthundertornadolightningdarkness storm that has no apparent cause except to make the interminable chase scene different for a couple of minutes  5 the villain an overweight dude with no physical presence dressed in clear plastic armour and with a serious breathing issue its like if darth vader had lived to 150 and brutally interrogated a million donuts he has no personality and basically no lines with noting if he had been silent the entire time it would have been better   6 it makes no reference to the previous three movies at all was this a reboot why even include max then since max didnt have any actual impact oh right the franchise so george miller made this movie trying to draw on his fan base for success i dont know but this is the truth  7 i am a fan of the first three mad max movies but my support of this franchise ends there like aliens 3 and terminator 3 there is nothing worth seeing here unless you want two hours of explosion and nothing nothing else
Jun 17 2015,positive,refreshingly absurd and preposterously violent a moment doesnt go by when you dont wonder what the hell is going on and why is there a guy strapped to the front of a truck jamming out on a guitar  in a world of cliche movies mad max is not one of them
Jun 17 2015,positive,fury road is not just about adrenalin rust though theres plenty its also rich with superior acting good storyline and cinematic   beauty the mad max way
Jun 17 2015,positive,def one of the best action movies in years loved it
Jun 17 2015,positive,mad max fury road is crazy crazy good
Jun 17 2015,positive,mad max fury road is the best action movie to come out in the past five years i was astounded by the amount of practical effects were put into it and by how well they were executed plus the preciseness and efforts that went into the effects were really easy and noticeable george miller outdoes himself with the work and measures he goes through in order to make this the amazingly entertaining and dazzling movie that this is not only is the action very very well done but the character development that happens throughout the movie is incredible and with hardly any dialogue used to show it in mad max fury road max rockatansky played by tom hardy goes on a wild and adrenalinepumped car chase that immortan joe played by the toecutter of the original mad max hugh keaysbyrne leads with his war boys to take down the war rig run by imperator furiosa charlize theron who forms an alliance with max to take five wives formerly selected for breeding to safety from immortan this actionpacked and exhilarating ride throughout the film is impressive and grand in scale and i cant wait to see what comes next i was so impressed and amazed by this movie that i was compelled to start writing reviews for movies and im glad i got to start out with this one
Jun 17 2015,positive,theres not much to say about this film that hasnt already been said its amazing full of exhilarating action scenes and technically flawless so because these are all established facts ill look at aspects of the film that i think were more or less overlooked what ill get out of the way right now is that this film may be the coolest and most entertaining action movie that ive seen in a long time in fact its hard to really compare it to anything i guess perhaps i had the type of sensation watching it that i had 16 years ago walking into the matrix not knowing much about it not in the sense that the two movies are anything alike but in the sense that i was seeing something ive never seen before something so technically sound and confident and also new fresh and ambigously stylistic    no one on this earth knows how to flip a car like george miller and its so amazing to see him back in this franchise the production on this movie was a disaster going all the way back to the early 2000s mel gibson was still attached the cars the actual ones we see in this film were being built and glimpses of the set were being occasionally thrown online even though the internet wasnt exactly the 10 pics a minute medium it is now then in 2003 production stopped mel gibson was dropped after his bizarre antics and the production budget appeared to be cut off about 7 years later photos starting dropping once again online of the cars that had been built all those years prior and it appeared that production was back on this time allegedly with heath ledger being courted for the title role    obviously problems with budget arose again this time believed to be more with the overall scale of the story miller wanted to tell too much damn money for something fairly obscure to youngsters and overly ambitious by todays hollywood standards however in 2012 it all came together tom hardy came on board and the stage was set the end result thank god was absolute insanity this film extracts the insanity in all of us watching it makes you feel like you are going a little crazy thats the way a film like this is supposed to be and this one never lets up    the story is quite simple snatch and grab job by furiosa of priceless wives of the might immortan joe and drive themsomewhere its not really all that important where they are going its how they get there charlize theron is perfect as furiosa someone who i guess held a lot of weight in the citadel before the movie kicks off most likely she was the head honcho driver for joe we see just how much ass she kicks from the get go the movie takes a very odd direction within the first few minutes not in a bad way of course without spoiling it max is basically introduced captured and sidelined all with in ten minutes from there it becomes furiosas film at least for the rest of the first act    the look and feel of this film is incredible when watching some of the scenes in the citadel a large city made up primarily of surrounding cliffs its hard not to wonder how they pulled it off the city looks real and lived in not like a hollywood set but like a real place the attention to detail is incredible with things like a shrine of steering wheels and really bizarre elevator systems running throughout the war boys are the minions who make up a large portion of the citadels population they look like something right out of the road warrior they all apparently have a disease of some sort that makes them constantly need blood transfusions and since water is scarce their bodys have more or less adapted to dehydration one war boy in particular we get to know is nux played by a scene stealing nicholas hoult    nux is a man but we look at him as a boy i thought it a very great concept to write this character for one it gives us insight for once into the mind and ambitions of a henchman all these films and many others have always had loads and loads of nameless henchmen but here we get to journey with one throughout his struggle to find a purpose for his existence in the wasteland hoult really brings life to an otherwise expendable character type and in the process created my favorite character in the film hes more or less the one to watch route for and it becomes fascinating watching his arc throughout the film    tom hardy is pretty good as max i wont say great but he was decent my biggest problem with his version of max is the fact that i see tom hardy not max rockatansky this is the fault of casting not the actor himself i think he is a terrific actor the thing about max is that hes max mel gibson was mostly unknown to the world upon release of max max i truly believe the film would have benefitted from an unknown in the role oh and how about getting an actual aussie because you know max rockatansky is australian having said all this it didnt really end up mattering all that much because max is simply the catalyst in this film we follow him and watch through his perspective for the most part but hes not the main character has absolutely nothing to do with the actual plot and takes a back seat many times to charlize therons furiosa in fact most everyone in the film has no idea he is even part of the action and hes simply referred to as the blood bank by the war boys early on    that brings me to furiosa could she possibly be ranked up there with ripley and sarah conner id like to hear a case against it because she is pretty damn badass theron owns this movie in every way shes got heart and her character feels emotion even through all her badassery she still maintains her feminine side shes a lady and she respects greatly immortan joes wives she feels obligated and responsible for their safety and it makes the story so much more compelling especially for a mad max film lets face it aside from part one these films have had next to no depth    the wives were also very good bringing in some actual character instead of simply scantily clad hotties we learn what these girls want and believe therefore we actually care for them as furiosa does and want them safe miller does such a great job of giving us these characters and in the midst of all this crazy action gets us to know who they are and why theyre important thats not an easy thing to do so with clear cut goals we follow the characters on an amazing ride something so bizarre and so insane that you walk out of the theater with a sense of wonder the film is haunting but not really dark its weird but beautiful at the same time its full of mayhem but also instills hope throughout all its barbaric tones it manages to have more heart than most films made today and certainly more than most actions films so yes the action scenes are brilliant but its the films heart and millers love of practical film making that are the big winners for me
Jun 17 2015,neutral,maybe one of the most overrated films of recent times a 5 year old could come up with a better story however the action is very good and that accounts for the stars if you like mindless action films then this one is for you
Jun 17 2015,positive,the best action movie since 2014s the guest and the most rewatchable movie since 2012s frances ha
Jun 17 2015,positive,mad max fury road is the best action movie to come out in the past five years i was astounded by the amount of practical effects were put into it and by how well they were executed plus the preciseness and efforts that went into the effects were really easy and noticeable george miller outdoes himself with the work and measures he goes through in order to make this the amazingly entertaining and dazzling movie that this is not only is the action very very well done but the character development that happens throughout the movie is incredible and with hardly any dialogue used to show it in mad max fury road max rockatansky played by tom hardy goes on a wild and adrenalinepumped car chase that immortan joe played by the toecutter of the original mad max hugh keaysbyrne leads with his war boys to take down the war rig run by imperator furiosa charlize theron who forms an alliance with max to take five wives formerly selected for breeding to safety from immortan this actionpacked and exhilarating ride throughout the film is impressive and grand in scale and i cant wait to see what comes next i was so impressed and amazed by this movie that i was compelled to start writing reviews for movies and im glad i got to start out with this one
Jun 17 2015,negative,since im not that old to sit around trying to find the first movie of mad max which shouldnt matter anyways all i heard in the movie was grunting and i was lost ever second of that movie meanwhile im reading all of these reviews saying how great it is and that it is mind boggling and i still cant wrap my head around the fact that it got a 98 like not to be rude but i think that was one of the worst movies ive ever watched and everyone i saw it with would agree with me just because we are able to use graphics now a days doesnt mean we always should
Jun 17 2015,positive,it is unquestionably the best action film of the past decade its arguably the best action film of the last forty years its inarguably one of the five best action films of that time period and ultimately it may well end up being one of the best films ever period     its pure unadulterated visual poetry it could have been 100 silent and the storytelling would have still had more heft and impact than 80 of all other screenplays
Jun 17 2015,positive,masterful direction 
Jun 17 2015,positive,what is there to say about this really that hasnt been said its so great the whole thing is basically one big chase scene but that works marvelously the action is so great with so many inventive tricks like the guys hanging from big swinging stilts    one of the best things about this movie  and probably the series in general  is how weird it is this dystopia is so wellformed filled with strange details that make it unique first of all theres the overall impression of the world and plot immortan joe ruling over everyone with his control of the water but theres also the idea of using max as a blood bag a slave for his blood and the war boys in general are strange and frightening but the most strange unique and funny touch by far is the dude on the back of the bad guys truck playing a flaming guitar like what its amazing it helps that george millers direction and the cinematography create a completely unique visual look i love how orange everything is and then how blue everything is at night the film seems to have its own weird color palette    the characters also manage to leave distinct and powerful impressions without really having tragic backstories or super complex characterization in some ways nux has the most complex characterization of the movie but its still a simple strong arc about a man who desperately wants to sacrifice himself for his king but begins to side with the good guys after he repeatedly fails and needs companions max is a badass simply put but watching his interplay with furiosa is interesting because he starts out selfishly stealing the truck and only serving himself until he slowly begins to place his trust in other people and even trust them but max isnt even the real protagonist that title belongs to furiosa played powerfully by charlize theron and new feminist hero its pointless for me to try to comment anything meaningful about the feminist politics at work in this movie because so much has been written about it already but ill just say that it was nice to have a blockbuster basically built around gender politics that was still enormously thrilling and fun i love that max and nux were vastly outnumbered my women especially in the scenes when furiosas old friends join them its also surprising that elderly women get such a chance to shine in the action scenes you dont see that in every action movie    overall this was just a great movie subtly weaving in themes and characterization without overwrought dialogue or melodramatics yet leaving the action and view of the world bigbudget and lightningfast around a third or so through i started smiling and i kept grinning throughout almost the entire movie
Jun 17 2015,positive,sucked at the beginning
Jun 17 2015,positive,very different type of movie i really enjoyed it
Jun 17 2015,positive,nonstop entertainment goodness more like a two hour amusement park ride than a movie great fun
Jun 17 2015,negative,the movie was fake had no storyline other than driving a truck across the desert has nothing to do with the mad max storyline and im sorry the guitar player showed it was a dune remake just insulting to people living the mad max trilogy
Jun 17 2015,positive,you know its good when 2 hrs feel  like 20 minutes and you find yourself on the edge of your seat from the get go with not one relaxed muscle in your body brilliant thank you mr miller
Jun 17 2015,positive,action does not stop imagery awesome like being in john blanches head
Jun 17 2015,positive,this movie melted my face off damn entertaining but i want to know one thing is this film about the title character or furosa
Jun 16 2015,positive,wow just wow even watching this movie six years later it is truly amazing i cannot say enough good things about mad max fury road it has a good case to be the best action movie of all time ranking alongside die hard the bourne series and crouching tiger hidden dragon    i love that george miller throws people into this universe with no explanation he does an incredible job telling a detailed interesting and engaging story with relatively few words so much of this film relies on showing instead of telling the way it should be if aspiring action directors need a textbook example for writing compelling narratives along with bestinclass action scenes they need not look future than this film    perhaps the best thing i can do is to list all the things that i really like here goes   the purposeful editing   the practical action sequences   the detailed and distinctive custom design   the vibrant and stark color grading   tom hardys unique take on the mad max character   the depth and originality of the entire universe   furiosa being on part with ellen ripley for badass women   the portrayal of differentlyabled people as human   the thoughtful subtext about climate change    this is a smart tight and complete film even though the plot is deadly simple dont let it fool you as anything other than brilliant to anyone that has not seen this film do yourself the favor of watching it asap
Jun 16 2015,positive,i must have looked like some kind of owl and deerintheheadlights combination while watching mad max and im fairly certain i didnt take a single breath until the credits rolled it is one helluva ride seriously george miller made the weirdest loudest rockandrollest ball of fire ive ever seen its like if shakespeare wrote a michael bay film go see it and anticipate it staying at the front of your mind for the next couple weeks
Jun 16 2015,positive,non stop action absolute craziness furiosa is tougher and more humane than max kudos to charlize theron for picking great characters
Jun 16 2015,positive,great movie definitely different
Jun 16 2015,positive,mad max is a brilliant masterpiece from director george miller hollywood once again hits its milestone with the best action movie of the decade
Jun 16 2015,positive,fury road has reinvigorated the action movie genre by proving to the audience that there is in fact a way to stun and thrill without the overuse of cgi and the infamous shaky cam
Jun 16 2015,positive,i had never seen any mad max movies thoroughly enjoyed the action and the universe is amazing went back and watched the other movies and became an instant fan george miller is a master
Jun 16 2015,positive,every part of this movie was indescribably good

Jun 16 2015,negative,i loved the original mad max movies but this sequel lost me

Jun 16 2015,negative,definitely not my type of movie  ive never seen the original films either
Jun 16 2015,neutral,one long chase scene  zero interesting characters  a hohum plot
Jun 16 2015,positive,visually amazing with the awesome designs of the cars and sets
Jun 16 2015,positive,love everything about this movie insane crazy choreographed action all the way through
Jun 16 2015,positive,face paced from the jump then all of a sudden it slows down and shows the true disparity our protagonist are facing then right on beat of the heavy metal guitar that is ever present throughout the movie the action picks right back up as our rebels regain hope and fight back against their pursuers must see
Jun 16 2015,positive,the best summer movie
Jun 16 2015,positive,visually pleasing tons of action bad guy death scene could have been better
Jun 16 2015,positive,i saw this on a day it was a lovely day and holy balls it was awesome this movie has one speed and one speed only the story is ok but lets be honest youre not seeing it for the story watch it soon and often
Jun 16 2015,negative,another action cliche hollywood comercial shit movie
Jun 16 2015,positive,this film is an action masterpiece if you would like to watch an entertaining eyebrow raising mythology inducing film then you will certainly enjoy this movie its perfect perfect in every way
Jun 16 2015,positive,im still thinking about this movie even though i saw it a month ago it was one of the most intense movie experiences i have had i was literally exhausted after the credits began to roll george miller certainly knows that he is doing
Jun 16 2015,positive,much better than expected
Jun 16 2015,positive,i have never watched any of the earlier mad max films but i thoroughly enjoyed this one  charlize theron is very convincing and nicholas hoult engaging in their respective roles  tom hardys accent seems to wander off on a journey of its own at times but he more than compensates for this with his smouldering close ups  the action is spectacular and relentless  i felt exhausted by then end
Jun 16 2015,negative,very repetitive in the action becomes tedious
Jun 16 2015,positive,i dont think there is any doubt mad max is the best film so far this year and one of the best action films ive seen in years
Jun 16 2015,positive,incredible and visually stunning fun ride
Jun 16 2015,positive,despite a few fakelooking and spedup fight sequences mad max fury road is a visually spectacular film that features some insane vehicles in worldclass car chases
Jun 16 2015,positive,a massive improvement on the original max films this is the best in the series a fully realized world is presented and youre immersed in it from beginning to end miller also understands that this is a gonzo action flick and dialogue when necessary should be kept to a minimum besides the fantastic actors who were chosen are great at emoting and raise the standards of the film special recognition goes to charlize theron who steals the show from tom hardys mad max id like to see a prequel featuring imperator furiosa
Jun 16 2015,positive,really great movie for one all the hype was right amazing action sequences badass characters really didnt want the the movie to end
Jun 16 2015,negative,i watched this movie because of all the great reviews but i found it to be extremely long and ridiculous
Jun 16 2015,negative,i just need to point out that miller did a wonderful job directing this movie beautiful lovely job the writers on the other hand were slightly off on their work they  focused too much on wits than the actual storyline to reach the level of recognition
Jun 16 2015,positive,not really sure why this had such high ratings but it is definitely worth a watch
Jun 16 2015,positive,it was crazy too crazy that all you can do was to laugh at it lol
Jun 16 2015,positive,mad max fury road is likely the first mainstream action movie of the century to follow the principles of great storytelling an excellent movie
Jun 16 2015,positive,good omage to the originals not great though
Jun 16 2015,positive,pure unadulterated just action
Jun 16 2015,positive,film of the year so far
Jun 16 2015,positive,mad max fury road is a action movie done right this movie is the reason i still believe in action movies  in fact i think its the only action movie i saw in recent memory the action is visceral and authentic made with real stunts yeah stunts they still exist fury road jams the pedal to the metal with almost nonstop action for only 2hrs that makes us think that every actionaventure movie we saw in past years feels like a new spongebob episode yop here we have real characters insane but real with no paperthin characterization hardy is perfect for the role he maybe says 5 words in the entire movie but we get the picture the man lives to survive and he is a little crazy put very crazy in it theron is the star of the show a warrior fighting to survive in a world made for men fury road is a beautifully realised vision of the postapocalyptic future filmed in namibia but looking like another planet is a must watch for every action fan the best in the series by far thank you mr miller  the good the action damn this is action after i saw this i realise that i didnt saw a action movie in yearshardy theron all the others with lunatic names and very insane behaviour and  grandma bikers   the bad only 2hrs  the ugly water blood mothers milk guzzleine  but its a lovely day
Jun 16 2015,positive,i have gone back to see this film six times now in the theater ive never seen a movie in a theater more than twice ever this film is a masterpiece and each time i see it i pick up on another plot nuance that connects the story even more you are a brilliant man george miller
Jun 16 2015,neutral,some spectacular scenes mostly hohum and predictable
Jun 16 2015,positive,what a great ride shot really well lots of great tones minimal dialog gives more weight to any thing spoken amazing production design was so happy i took my wife along and we got to share the experience

Jun 15 2015,positive,walking into mad max and having no previous knowledge of the franchise or characters the first 25 minutes were mostly becoming acclimated to a totally new kind of cinematography and storytelling the characters proved to have their own captivating silentbutdeadly traits that fit remarkably well into a wartorn intransigent world while being coupled with highintensity desperate motives the film left me satisfied with the plot and yet hungry to learn more of the universe and characters something that i think makes an enjoyable movie and successful franchise
Jun 15 2015,positive,one of the most incredibly human and intelligent movies i have ever seen the acting and screenplay are strong giving this film an almost superhuman quality the relentless thunder and lightning of one fast paced scene after another is so smoothly constructed that it is not tiring nor monotonous instead we experience a storyline which is weaved around survival mutual concern and compassion the explosions and killings all make sense in the end when freedom prevails and we understand what all the fuss is about this is not an action movie overblown with a meaningless series of explosions and killings no this is a film about a people with a purpose and strives to achieve a goal in the end you sense it and when it achieves that purpose you get an incredibly satisfying sense of relief and happiness the film creates a monstrous life and then creates an equally unbelievable catharsis and it does this with an amazing skill in manipulating cinematography acting and screenplay that i have never seen achieved in such a fastpaced and emotionally charged movie
Jun 15 2015,positive,crazy   intense  insane  incomparable  it is nearly 100 straight minutes of intense action i cant think of any movie to compare it to  it felt very unique   i also liked the strong female characters   good to see the women being as badass as the guys   i gotta wonder if the people who made this were on some serious drugs as it is just crazy over the top   but entertaining
Jun 15 2015,positive,if you like very well made action films you have found the pinnacle of great action flicks a hell of a fun ride throughout with breathtaking cinematography and engrossing eerie acting
Jun 15 2015,positive,the story is extremely simple but mad max is an incredible feat in direction the pace is breathless never slowing down or becoming boring for the 2 hour length the underlying messages and symbols are plentiful and extremely deep all the performers are a joy to watch and theron  hardy are one of the best recent on screen duos i really enjoyed how the audience was required to put the story together for themselves instead of it just being told to them however the two central characters could have been fleshed out more especially max who has flashbacks the entire movie none of which are explained overall this is one of the best popcorn flicks youll ever watch with an incredibly deep feminist message along with many others about class power government and more
Jun 15 2015,positive,wow great action acting and intensity tom hardy is electric and engaging and charlize was so bad ass yet feminine it just needed more tom hardy and more clothes on the girls
Jun 15 2015,neutral,great action silly plot no character development or story silly plot the fact that this has 98 on rotten tomatoes when most of the people leaving my theater were grumbling about how average it was  means that they paid for high reviews from top critics here this is not a 98 fresh film
Jun 15 2015,positive,this was terrific that is all
Jun 15 2015,positive,they should not sell this as a mad max film mad max was the star of the films he was in i think this max had about 20 lines total and was not focal point or the star of this movie  the one scene he had to go back and kill the bad guys they did not even show it very entertaining but no mad max film and all of you who say i need to see or did not see the originals you need to see them
Jun 15 2015,negative,ok ish film a bit like the old ones could have had a lot better story line tho
Jun 15 2015,positive,with beautiful photography astonishing special effects and strong female characters this movie provides what it promises and more the best summer movie of 2015 so far
Jun 15 2015,neutral,theres a good 90 minute bmovie lurking in here somewhere but its too long and the action sequences go on and on without ever really exciting
Jun 15 2015,positive,loud exhausting crashes loved the charlize theron character
Jun 15 2015,positive,action packed 
Jun 15 2015,negative,i dont know who rates these movies or if they were even watched by the person rating the movie but this movie was far from good i regreted every minute of this movie and if i hadnt spent 50 to see it then i would have walked out i expected so much more
Jun 15 2015,positive,best fucking movie all year bravo miller bravo
Jun 15 2015,positive,based upon the great reviews i expected more nowhere near as good a movie as road warrior but solid
Jun 15 2015,positive,i know it seems clichãd but this is actually insanely mad i dont believe ive ever seen a movie that i can claim has actually made me contract epilepsy with totally dazzling visuals madcap explosions but with a plot which wanders a path thinner than a mountain goat which is actually a blessing and told by totally realised characters on and the famed doof warrior who rides atop a mobile concert befit with a wall of guitar amps all hooked up to a bed panflamethrower electric guitar all the while looking like an eyeless noseless marylin manson as a death squad of murderous villains pursue our heroes through the desert good stuff
Jun 15 2015,positive,awesome movie  non stop action  character and plot development happens by accident
Jun 15 2015,negative,less plot than dude wheres my car  drive for an hour in one direction then return to origin  only positive point being it wasnt camp like george millers original
Jun 15 2015,positive,absolutely loved this film the action was amazing and the movie was very well paced one of the first really good villains i have seen in film within the recent years i cant encourage you enough go see this movie
Jun 15 2015,positive,i dont have any idea why this movie is getting such good reviews the movie basically shows a bunch of people drive from point a to b and then b to a along the way they get attacked a bunch of times by large groups of cars doesnt make sense that they survived all the attacks given they were driving a 53 fuel truck and that there were only 2 useful people on the truck theres a lot of things that dont make sense in the movie  for example one of the vehicles has a guy playing a guitar the whole time the visuals are really good overall but the story line doesnt make much sense
Jun 15 2015,negative,was i the only person who didnt like this film
Jun 15 2015,positive,epic movie making courtesy of george miller
Jun 15 2015,positive,not quite as good as they say but good
Jun 15 2015,positive,the most action you are likely to see packed into one movie this summer
Jun 15 2015,positive,mad max fury road has intense action a strong cast and good visuals the movie is entertaining and a worthy followup to the previous movies
Jun 15 2015,positive,cant remember the last time i smiled so much in a theater  finally something brilliant that breaks the mold
Jun 15 2015,positive,visceral vibrant and thoroughly entertaining from start to finish fury road wholly reinvents the mad max series   its a wonderful reboot that never strays from its intent or narrative  a supercharged chase film with surprisingly human undertones  apparently a sequel is already in the works and i for one cannot wait to go back into the wasteland
Jun 15 2015,positive,lots of action involved in a very long car chase scene entertaining but the story doesnt develop much passed that
Jun 15 2015,negative,i would rather sit through 20 sharknado sequels than put up with 10 minutes of this piece of crap again this shows where our society is headed no plot bad acting all nonsensical action i can only feel sorrow for all of all of the trees that gave their lives to fabricate the scripts im sure they they would have preferred to be made into a softer grade of paper so some worth while purpose would have been fulfilled i even had to give it half a star just to post this review
Jun 15 2015,positive,this movie is splendid mayhem i enjoyed it even more than the original mad max which is considered a classic the visual effects are stunning and the plot is meaty enough to keep the viewer engrossed till the end i regret not being able to watch it on the big screen
Jun 15 2015,positive,when ever i try to explain my favorite scenes in this movie i cant an hour and 30 minutes well shot action will see again
Jun 15 2015,positive,this movie is amazing best movie this year so far ive seen it twice already and cant wait to watch it again
Jun 14 2015,positive,visually entertaining and the action was over the top and thats just good
Jun 14 2015,negative,very boringno story no change of sceneif you want to be entertained just skip this one
Jun 14 2015,positive,completely bonkers and completely awesome  i dont know how george miller turned an overthetop action sequence lasting two hours into a thoughtful remarkable movie that works
Jun 14 2015,negative,i thought this movie would be similar to the previous title but sadly it was more like a silly apocalyptic death race the actors were rather horrible withe the main characters garbling through their lines in the end i was unimpressed even with the anticlimactic death of the main antagonist and lack of emotion from the actors when character after character died i even cared less and less as time went on and found myself looking at my phone
Jun 14 2015,positive,pretty good not convinced its 5 stars though
Jun 14 2015,positive,rarely does a director nail it in character development store depth and visual expression but george miller thanks to wbs trust delivered the allegory and action here rival only the matrix and terminator 2
Jun 14 2015,negative,very disappointing good action but very thats it people were leaving the theatre
Jun 14 2015,positive,this movie was honestly much much better than i expected it to be if i told you that i was going to make a film about car chase battles set in a post apocalyptic nightmare while also highlighting a theme of female empowerment youd probably look at me like i was insane feminism and car explosions dont go together you say well apparently they do and to a colossal effect charlize theron is the real hero of this movie starring as furiosa a female soldier in the fanatical army of immortal joe who goes rogue to kidnap joes wivesslaves to bring them to freedom she is pursued for the next 90 minutes with the help of max tom hardy an escaped prisoner of joes army while it sounds like it could be tedious it isnt the action sequences are punctuated by sincere character development and this director lets you know that the stakes are real anything really can happen to anyone in this movie add to that real life stunts and a welcomed lack of nauseating cgi effects and youve got a very visceral movie in mad max fury road
Jun 14 2015,positive,weirdâ action out of control havoc still great
Jun 14 2015,positive,good but too little dialogue for me
Jun 14 2015,positive,i think im being nice with 3 stars
Jun 14 2015,negative,in 1990 i was taken by a friend to see a movie called hardwarea film about an android that escaped a lab rebuilt itself in the apartment of a soldiers girlfriend and went on a killing spree half way through this cinematic abortion i wanted to find the nearest spoon and gouge out my eyes to put an end to the misery of watching this cacophony of science fiction rubbish on that day i remember making a public declaration that if i were to live until the extinction of our solar system that i would never be able to see a film worse than this    i stand here before you to state that i have now must be corrected mad max fury road is without questions or debate the single worst film i have ever seen in my entire life this movie was so horrid it makes santa claus conquers the martians look like citizen kane this incomprehensible mess made absolutely no sense whatsoever had the story line that could have been written on a torn piece of a cocktail napkin and the entertainment value left for chimpanzees or other small primates with under developed brains the spedup method in which this film was put together in combination with the nonstop dubbing of any dialog in this film is proof that if you put enough explosions monosyllabic grunts and car crashes in one film people will love it     a 12 star review is being generous to this film
Jun 14 2015,negative,i dont understand why people like this movie so much the main character can barely speak theres no depth to any character theres no plot they blow up the same geological rock structure twice in two days with no explanation for why its intact when they blow it up the second time theres no explanation for most of the bizarre stuff that happens in this movie this is one of the worst movies ive seen in a long time
Jun 14 2015,positive,not a movie i would typically see but found myself really liking this one
Jun 14 2015,negative,my wife motherinlaw and i watched about 35 minutes of this movie and walked out  special effects do not make a movie
Jun 14 2015,positive,good show harding was playing bain again though
Jun 14 2015,positive,a great homage to the road warrior  lots of action mayhem and tricked out vehicles roaming a post apocalyptic wasteland george miller scores again
Jun 14 2015,positive,i loved this movie fastpaced and cool my favorite is the doof warrior with the guitar     so what is it i liked about mad max fury road well the characters are all very good the action is amazing it says a lot when you can get good entertainment and characterization from actions and driving cars this is a thrill ride through and through
Jun 14 2015,positive,i was disappointed with the movie the action shots were great and it was definitely mad max but the story line im just not sure
Jun 14 2015,positive,this was a great movies that action and the plot went well together a great watch
Jun 14 2015,negative,i fell asleep 2 times lots of action very little plot little to no character development if you are a 16 year old boy you will probably love it
Jun 14 2015,positive,personally i dont get all the fuss over this movie i never got into the mad max series before and i dont think this film got me interested into seeing the other previous films granted the cinematography is brilliant and the story isnt that bad but it just felt long when it didnt have to be and though a lot of the supporting characters got great development the main protagonist and antagonist hardly get any so really this ones a mix bag for me as well as affecting my personal preference levels not a bad movie at all and i do think people should watch it but just go in with your expectations a little lower than you may have before
Jun 14 2015,negative,one of the worst movies i have ever wasted money on max grunts his way through the movie ive seen way better special effects this was a sand filled mess story what story max helps people drive out to the middle of nowhere only to drive back again and do absolutely nothing except break stuff the only part that was enjoyable was the guitarist strumming wildly on his electric guitar sadly the guitarist dies the end
Jun 14 2015,positive,truly an epic movie if d box is available well worth the extra 
Jun 14 2015,neutral,wow i think i must be getting old or jaded this film is getting such wonderful reviews i was expecting to be enthralled i admire tom hardy as an actor too this one left me cold though now back to my rocking chair and slippers
Jun 14 2015,positive,thrill ride loved it but wish their was more complexity to the storyline
Jun 14 2015,positive,fantastic action fantastic acting and the practical effects in this movie are beyond incredible
Jun 14 2015,positive,this movie was awesome love the car with the drums  suspended guitar play that added more drama  action
Jun 14 2015,positive,solid action  dystopian future  real characters  max is passing through the story rather than leading it  furiosa is a complex character  no real plot twists
Jun 14 2015,positive,really fun ride but dont expect it to deliver on the crazy good reviews
Jun 14 2015,positive,absolutely entertaining this is better than road warrior
Jun 14 2015,neutral,high octane super fun i like the fact that the girls were not just sitting around going help me help me the special effects sequences were ground breaking and the stunt work was superb only flaw i think max could have been a bit more exciting
Jun 14 2015,positive,about 4 or 5 times during the movie i had to actively remind myself to relax because i occasionally noticed that my muscles started to get sore from being so tense i mean that in a good way and that guitar is goddamn hilarious every single time it appears
Jun 14 2015,positive,two hours long twisted overthetop brilliant testosteronefuelled madness as a new entry in the classic series  mad max fury road earns its title in every way possible with tom hardy nailing the performance of haunted max rockatansky and adding depth to the character that mel gibson made cult george millers fury road is not only the best film in the franchise its the anarchydriven crazy ride straight to valhalla of cinematography
Jun 14 2015,positive,this is now my favorite action movie
Jun 14 2015,positive,for once a movie that lives up to the hype i loved it cant wait to buy the movie when it comes out on dvd
Jun 14 2015,positive,two hours long twisted overthetop brilliant testosteronefuelled madness as a new entry in the classic series  mad max fury road earns its title in every way possible with tom hardy nailing the performance of haunted max rockatansky and adding depth to the character that mel gibson made cult george millers fury road is not only the best film in the franchise its the anarchydriven crazy ride straight to valhalla of cinematography
Jun 14 2015,positive,came for the action  thats what i got
Jun 14 2015,positive,only two words can some what sum up this awesome film cinematic masterpiece
Jun 14 2015,positive,intense hardy is fantastic in the role the action is brilliant and i cant wait to see what comes next
Jun 14 2015,negative,could have been done in 30min way over extended scenes
Jun 14 2015,positive,charlize and her robotic arm are my heroes
Jun 14 2015,negative,so i finally sat through this one took me three tries and i really dont understand the hype maybe i didnt get it but whats happening besides the action sequences to me this felt like one long shot of choreographed explosions and extensive violence with little to no character development or background story if its all about vengeance the good go have your vengeance i somehow expected a little more depth
Jun 14 2015,positive,mad max fury road follows max rockatansky played by tom hardy as he is caught up in between a warlord immortan joe and one of his rogue imperators furiosa played by charlize theron who has kidnapped joes wives     the one thing to know about this film is the nonstop action this is an action film that takes vehicular mayhem to the extreme while still staying within the confines of reality unlike some other franchises ff the high octane action becomes even more impressive when you realise that miller had a strong focus on practical effects with claims of 8090 practical the action in the film is also framed perfectly for you to enjoy the spectacle without the excessive cutting and shaking that plagues many modern action scenes     the story of the film is simple playing out like one continuous chase akin to a simple video game dialogue is also scarce with max saying about as much as a movie extra however although these seem like drawbacks they allow the film to be unrelenting in the continuous action even with the minimal dialogue and plot the postapocalyptic world still seems complete due to the excellent design of everything     the design of the movie is fantastic every detail on the vehicles and the costumes builds a world in which the insane action seems likes it would occur it is amazing that they actually built many of the vehicles and the subtle plot details within the props the design actually feels like everything was built from the decaying pieces of the pre apocalyptic world and seems practical for what they do     tom hardy does a great job of playing max displaying a character driven mad by his history and the decaying world around him although max may be our titular character the most interesting person would definitely be furiosa another great performance by academy award winner charlize theron although it is hard to remember any characters name besides the two mentioned the other characters are still fun to watch and have interesting moments even without their names you will still be like nicholas hoult was awesome as whoever he was i would have liked to see more of immortan joe because he seemed like a great villain when he was present but i felt like it wasnt enough     some of you may be hesitant to see fury road as it is the fourth movie in a franchise from over thirty years ago however walking in with no knowledge you will still be able to enjoy the film fury road is interesting as it not a direct sequel to any of the previous films nor prequel or reboot instead it takes the best parts of the character and the world to tell another story that fits within the world but without the necessity of prior knowledge   from the opening credits and hardys narration my name is max to the very end mad max fury road is gritty entertaining and a neverending action thrill ride this film offers more than just the action it has a female lead that will be remembered like ripley or sarah connor there are countless memorable sequences throughout and i found it impossible to not enjoy the film regardless of how you felt about the previous films i thought they were okay this is something definitely worth seeing
Jun 14 2015,positive,believe the hype who needs plot with action like this the relentless hioctane pursuit is awesome and everything looks amazing
Jun 14 2015,positive,mad max is a colossal achievement in the moviemaking world with its tremendously persistent pace and constant reverence unseen in our millennium it has the emotions to back up the bombastic action a balance not usually witnessed in your ordinary summer popcorn flick    tom hardy and charlize theron are impeccably cast and do an admirable job as the lead characters of this postapocalyptic remake tom hardys rendition of mad albeit more crazy and unpredictable was still marvelous in its own right charlize therons neverbeforeseen character imperator furiosa helped enforce much of the emotion thats deliberately felt while still maintaining an aggressively courageous mindset    all in all mad max satisfies in pretty much every department masterclass in its execution mad max will be stored in my personal list of favorite films of all time
Jun 14 2015,positive,what every action movie in the last ten years strives for minimal cg and a return to practical effects with shots so beautiful my soul leapt from the seat before being slammed back into it with amazing characters like immorten joe furiosa and the doof oh yeah and max only real problem with the movie is maxs presence is so low key they should of named the movie furiosa but i liked tom hardys portrayal nonetheless best movie of the year
Jun 13 2015,positive,actual stuff happening inventive and imaginative art design an energetic score a solid story told mainly through show dont tell sign me up
Jun 13 2015,negative,giving this movie one star is being generous so bad that when the power went out in the theatre i was relieved that i didnt have to sit thru any more
Jun 13 2015,negative,bad plot confusing film
Jun 13 2015,positive,great special effects but the story line was a bit dry
Jun 13 2015,positive,the first 30mins of this movie are some of the most exciting and visually thrilling ive ever seen
Jun 13 2015,negative,i was very disappointed in this movie its plot was beyond generic and very predictable lots of parts made no sense the action was well done but i dont like tom hardy
Jun 13 2015,negative,movie had more special effects than story line movie had many blank outs between scenes hard to follow which actors had been killed off main actor abruptly went from hr death bed to becoming well again through a blood transfusion with a random donor that worked out i guess thats what happened the best character was the two headed lizard that got eaten during the first two minutes of the movie and the crazed actor who played the guitarduring the truck chases this movie stunk up the theater
Jun 13 2015,positive,one raw kinetic fireball of a movie
Jun 13 2015,positive,must  must  must see that is all oh yeah charlize theron
Jun 13 2015,positive,spectacular whenever the subject of cinematography comes up we think of movies like avatar for their grandeur and array of colours to me mad max fury road is right up there the colours are there but theyre multiple shades of the desert sand mixed with plumes of smoke the grandeur is there but it consists of vast expanses of deserts and testosteronedriven action sequences    the performances are definitely worth mentioning as well tom hardy as the eponymous character is solid as ever and charlize theron is breathtakingly beautiful despite the war paint but the scenestealers were hugh keaysbyrne as the ominous immortal joe and the supremelytalented nicholas hoult as the crazed nux    this flick is just one crazy ride filled with incredible action a simpleyetintriguing storyline and fantastic performances definitely a mustwatch
Jun 13 2015,negative,what in the world did i just watch
Jun 13 2015,negative,how did this movie get such high reviews  i think only young people would like this movie not for someone in their 50s
Jun 13 2015,positive,heartpounding fun and beautiful george millers latest mad max installment was absolutely amazing
Jun 13 2015,positive,thelma and louise on steroids
Jun 13 2015,negative,not my kinda movie must say the graphics creativity etc amazing though
Jun 13 2015,positive,one of the mot exhilarating visually inventive and exciting action films ive ever seen a virtual triumph of the cinematic form  buoyed by strong performances especially from theron and pulse pounding frenetic action sequences that are clearly mostly practical watched it after the avengers and this film clearly a testament to doing things the old way
Jun 13 2015,positive,fun wild crazy violent nonstop action with just enough plot
Jun 13 2015,positive,mad max fury road is the best installment in the franchise it is the  most testosterone filled fun you will have at the theatre in a long time
Jun 13 2015,positive,one of the best movies ive ever seen in a long time
Jun 13 2015,positive,although the leads arnt quite engaging may be furiosa a bit but man doesnt this movie deliver on everything elsea wild rideevery time an action sequence ends you realize you are short of breath
Jun 13 2015,positive,very dark but it was good
Jun 13 2015,negative,it was the worst movie ever omg no point to the plot at all just awful
Jun 13 2015,positive,excellent action but lacking in plot
Jun 13 2015,positive,from the sand storm to the motivational guitarplayer the whole thing just oozes of creativity which is complimented well by the story telling prowess of george miller
Jun 13 2015,positive,holy freakin crap this movie is great
Jun 13 2015,negative,did not really like itlike the landscape the actors but the story itself was not my thing
Jun 13 2015,positive,relentless from beginning to end beautiful to look with a killer soundtrack to compliment the on screen carnage very little dialogue with much being conveyed through a look or body movement yes max is superfluous to requirements and theron is the real star of the film but each complements the other and the film would be a lesser beast without them
Jun 13 2015,negative,a fim made for the video game generation  like star wars 4 with jarjar binks it is a film without any characterisation more profound than a little puddle a huge disappointment in almost every way aside from some lovely cinematography and editing the plot is absolutely nonexistent and the hope lines lifted almost word for word from shawshank are a pathetic attempt to lift the whole project out of the dust mad max 2 the road warrior gives the character depth  through tiny glimpses of humanity in his sharing of his food with the dog and his relationship with the gyro captain here neither theron nor hardy are given enough to say to make you care one jot about their cartoon characters and the modelsinwhite breeders are beyond silly  2 out of 10
Jun 13 2015,positive,wfo from the get go great action movie
Jun 13 2015,positive,very overrated film nowhere near a 98 in my book still its an awesome movie
Jun 13 2015,positive,max helps a band of wives escape from their husband to a place of water and green across the desert
Jun 13 2015,positive,despite the hype mad maxs visually stunning beauty and overzealous twisted story cant make up for the fact that its action sequences are virtually the exact same car chase for an approximately two hour duration to get lost in its look is a whimsical fare that is easily achieved by watching clips or trailers perhaps i am being too harsh on it but mad max would have curried more favour from exposing more of its fantasy elements instead of drowning them in explosions
Jun 13 2015,positive,this movie is insane  this is by far the definitive action film of the decade
Jun 13 2015,positive,a weird scifi a ton movie with great shots and good story line   you might be lost in the beginning but if you just accept the movie for how it is you will enjoy your ride since there is no back story to explain the reasons why world in mad max is what it is
Jun 13 2015,positive,incredible and immersive 8910 a      the characters arent incredibly strong making moments not filled with action lesser in entertainment value but the aweinspiring amazing and endlessly funtowatch action sequences with incredible direction cinematography effects and performances make it a fantastic movie
Jun 13 2015,positive,awesome stunt work amazing visuals incredible action thats both detailed and comprehensible and tom hardy and charlize theron both give great performances the story has a lot of heart and you care about all the main characters and there is a guy on top of a car playing an electric guitar that shoots flames
Jun 13 2015,positive,best moviegoing experience in years
Jun 13 2015,positive,volume was extremely loud bring earplugs
Jun 13 2015,positive,thrill ride throughout  i personally loved it
Jun 13 2015,positive,intricate plot and characters had depth need to see the movie again sometimes overwhelming action
Jun 13 2015,positive,good movie lots of action from beginning to end charlene the actress excellent part she better than max
Jun 13 2015,positive,one of the most imaginative movies that ive seen in a long time  proof that liveaction is not dead and that you dont need a lot of cgi to make an excellent movie  those pole cats were freaking amazing  i dont know if i would have the guts to get up at the end of those poles and swing around like they did  eeeeek
Jun 13 2015,positive,despite the fact that max himself takes a backseat in this story i hardly noticed while watching because i was so lost in the action and style of the film i felt like a kid who wanted to watch it again and again what a lovely day
Jun 13 2015,positive,unique thoroughly entertaining and above all  batshit insane
Jun 13 2015,positive,i finally got to see this movie being the feminist movie lover that i am everyone wanted me to see it the look of shock on peoples faces when i say no i havent seen it yet was pretty amusing by the time i wanted to see it everyone had already gone then it was a matter of finding a theater that still played it and being in the area to watch it either way it was worth seeing it on the big screen     first let me say the action was superb michael bay at his best could not even touch the symphony of explosions fist fights shoot outs and cars ramming each other that miller created  kudos to all the graphic artists set and costume designers that made it possible     second casting was great in fact it is what attracted me to this movie in the first place i admit that tom hardy has been my eye candy but he is a great actor as well choosing him for max was a great fit charlize theron as furiosa was the best fit of all i honestly dont see anyone else in that role nicholas hoult was also a very nice surprise just when i think he is going to be erased from the movie at the start he rises to the occasion and becomes a strong part of it even the actresses that were the wives were wonderful drawing attention to each ones dominate traits and not being a typical group of pretty women that need to be rescued     so this movie has been labeled as a feminist movie i agree with the label it is far better than many action flicks that have women in the background or are the reason why the protagonist is fighting some people have gone as far to call it a furiosa movie well no i wouldnt go that far furiosa was a driving power but it was more like a partnership between genders to accomplish the goal not even the wives were weak and helpless my breath caught when a pregnant woman stood in front of max to protect him while making eye contact with her enemy they actively took part in their escape and survival max and furiosa in a dance of spraying bullets and car chasing was a beautiful experience miller gave each character equal credit in the movie max didnt have many lines yes but someone who has been alone then taken prisoner to be used for his blood and feels responsible for the death of many people would have a social impairment he was a similar character in lawless but a little more well mad the expressions and nonverbals he did got his point across well anyway the tribe of older women was also nice to see these desert amazons were tough and kicked the shit out of an army full of crazed men just both genders equally beating each other with no hesitation i want to see more of this this one is high on my feminist meter up there with edge of tomorrow and alien     thank you mr miller for a movie that gave me hope for gender equality in film
Jun 13 2015,neutral,meh action stop action stop action stop  no back story or any real character development character interaction   i didnt care if any of them lived or died  also the post apocalyptic world of mad max could have been developed more besides a few mins at the start and the end the entire move is set in barren waste land  i would have liked to see more detail of this world and its cities
Jun 13 2015,negative,with so many positive reviews i thought id check it out was very disappointed its way too long for a story thats barely there i couldnt help but check my phone multiple times throughout to check the time the action sequences were visually impressive but with so little plot you couldnt really feel the stakes i take it back actually there is no story only action sequences lets put it this way if you loved pacific rim youll love this too probably though even pacific rim had a more developed and interesting story there are definitely worse movies out there but the hype far outweighs fury roads executionsubstance     think of a typical michael bay movie but without the characters and plot
Jun 13 2015,neutral,i didnt understand what the hell was going on there was no dialogue so you mean they have a ton of gasoline but no water the purpose and plot of the movie didnt make any sense i truly didnt understand what was going on until pretty much end    great action however it felt like i was watching wacky races  when i was a kid and i thought dick dastardly and muttley was going to show up during this long race
Jun 13 2015,positive,this film is a must see
Jun 13 2015,negative,worst movie ive seen in some time and i saw hot tub time machine 2  if it was on tv i would have put pawn stars on instead
Jun 13 2015,negative,two hours of unrelenting noise and violence with none of the character and humor that made road warrior or beyond thunderdome worthwhile  if your idea of a great concert is one song played over and over at top volume this is the film for you
Jun 13 2015,positive,good especially if one appreciates the originals there is the requisite amount of absurdity and the action is high coupled with some very cool camera shots and awareness that the film doesnt take itself too seriously this was definitely entertaining
Jun 13 2015,positive,non stop action good fun would like to have had more from max though id definitely watch it again
Jun 13 2015,positive,breathtaking and what a way to have a hard on
Jun 13 2015,positive,fantastic cgigraphics  well done   somewhat good story line   being a movie based solely on a chase they did an excellent job in keeping you entertained but its only a movie solely based on a chase    my recommendation worthy of watching but wait for it on movie on demand not in the cinema
Jun 13 2015,positive,perfection when a movie just works characters are all interesting and each one of them offer something of great impact a relentless movie that starts strong and doesnt let go seriously an instant classic of a film
Jun 13 2015,positive,best editing to coincide with a brilliant soundtrack that i have ever see a brilliant stunning nervewracking 2 hours with excellent acting action unforgettable visuals best film that i have seen in many years
Jun 13 2015,negative,wasnt overly impressed
Jun 13 2015,negative,im one of the small percent that did not like it it literally was 2 hours of the exact same thing and anticlimactic action its not that it wasnt believable or far fetched i expected that it was petty and drawn out it avoided easy clear solutions in favor of long drawn out more of the same and i certainly do not think it had the same depth of soul searching morality that the first one had sorry i just cant 2 stars because it was beautiful well shot and the 30 or so lines in the movie were well delivered
Jun 12 2015,positive,well well 2015 a another great blockbuster action movie in may what a lovely year it is
Jun 12 2015,positive,2 hour long chase sequence great characters outstanding action sequences this is easily the best in the mad max franchise and one of the best action movies of all time george miller is truly a mastermind
Jun 12 2015,positive,it wasnt as good as thunderdome
Jun 12 2015,positive,amazing on every level damn near perfect
Jun 12 2015,positive,this movie was so much more than i had expected definitely worth seeing in a theater
Jun 12 2015,positive,absolutely loved this movie and to think i didnt have this on my list as a must see glad i changed my mind
Jun 12 2015,negative,dont understand how everyone loved this it was really one of the stupidest movies ive seen in a while
Jun 12 2015,positive,the action was so insane this is a movie you have to experience in theaters
Jun 12 2015,positive,as good as a madmax movie can be
Jun 12 2015,negative,really disappointed 
Jun 12 2015,positive,this was amazing must be seen in the theater two thumbs up
Jun 12 2015,positive,amazing movie with legitimate nonstop action throughout excellent narrative and characters
Jun 12 2015,positive,it was okay had action  sorry the original is still the besthowever ct was quite good
Jun 12 2015,positive,many people are gaga for this and while i say pump the brakes a bit to those people i still very much enjoyed fury road charlize theron shows her versatility i just watched her make pussy jokes with seth mcfarlane in a million ways to die in the west last year fury road is very stylish the bright desert the monster vehicles the fuckedup looking characters its also amazing how so much information is conveyed through actions and not through dialog you dont learn many other characters names or their backstories but you dont need to just watch it
Jun 12 2015,negative,one long long car chase
Jun 12 2015,negative,skip it extremely disappointing nonsensical and movie that drags on and on and on
Jun 12 2015,neutral,disappointed wasnt what it was hyped up to be  witness me
Jun 12 2015,positive,truly a great original story line for a new series start
Jun 12 2015,positive,was a decent action flick with impressive visuals and a good feel outside of that the plot is pretty straight forward fleeing to a better place and resulting car chase and the character development was more shrouded in mystery kinda felt like a setup to a series enjoyable lotsa sand and max with a flat affect
Jun 12 2015,positive,the best way ive heard this described is as a surprisingly amazing b movie the main character max might as well be a caveman and has basically no lines furiousa however has a great performance with some hidden depth of character during what is effectively a drawn out battlecar chase they even manage to work in a romance side plot not involving furiousa or max
Jun 12 2015,positive,the special effects in this movie are stunning if youve never even seen a mad max it doesnt matter still worth a watch on the big screen
Jun 12 2015,negative,i would rather give it zero stars how can so many people like this boring two hour truck race no story horrible acting and the whole movies was a truck race  i loved the original there was a story and action i just saw furious 7 and that was awesome there was action acting and a story mad max was bad max
Jun 12 2015,negative,i threw away 120 min of my life 120 min ill never get back and i even paid for throwing these valuable minutes away i went and saw mad maximum piece of horrific crap a movie made from combining ishtar and street of fire remember michael paré exactly what i thought  this movie has absolutely zero redeeming qualities or values a script that could fit on a cocktail napkin and acting with line delivery like and automated customer service phone line  i read reviews and took the words of loved ones but this one i either didnt smoke the right amount of crack or i am just not seeing it
Jun 12 2015,positive,loved the guitar player creative masterpiece
Jun 12 2015,positive,must see movie in my top 3 of the year so far
Jun 12 2015,positive,fantastic thats all i can say this movie left me speechless and it is so great and so well directed i cant wait to watch it over and over when it is released on blu ray
Jun 12 2015,positive,fabulous  so entertaining
Jun 12 2015,negative,i cannot for the life of me figure out what movie the critics were watching when they gave this one a 98 rating  it was truly one of the most disjointed unentertaining films i have seen in recent history   with no character development and spotty dialog the movie went from one overthetop cgi effect to another  this was no homage to the original  in fact besides the name there is no comparison whatsoever to the original film  usually i can find something redeeming about most films but in this case if you are even considering seeing this film dont
Jun 12 2015,positive,run err drive furiosa drive   exciting nonstop action
Jun 12 2015,positive,i had never seen the old ones this definitely kept me entertained from start to finish i look forward to the following ones
Jun 12 2015,positive,going to see this one on the big screen again
Jun 12 2015,negative,great special effects but weird movie that was super random
Jun 12 2015,positive,this movie was an absolute thrill ride from beginning to end one of the best movie experiences i have had in years in fact so good that i saw it three times the last time i saw a movie that good was when i went to see smoking aces and i only saw that one twice kudos to george miller on returning to make such a great film and show these new directors that settling for a cheap story with tons of cg stands no chance of good ole classic stunts action and suspense not to mention a great score by junkie xl
Jun 12 2015,positive,great driving sequences and great action to me it was the best movie all year in my opinion they did everything right from the right actors to the coolness factor and all the things you want to see in a mad max movie plus there is a guy the plays a guitar that spits fire two words to explain this movie go watch it
Jun 12 2015,positive,my heart was pounding constantly and the music swept me away i may even take drumming lessens just to perform the epic percussions from this stellar movie what really makes mad max fury road so special is its practical effects and scenes that never get boring  mad max fury road is probably the best action movie of the decade
Jun 12 2015,positive,as your watching it you know it achieves greatness oddly enough it wouldnt be that bad to bring the whole family to this one
Jun 12 2015,positive,saw mad max  its sad that the post apocalyptic thriller hasnt advanced much  chaotic car chases and assisting damsels in distress can only carry a movie so far    love tom hardy  charlize  but theyd do better with a script with words  just a few words      im not sure how well the franchise was reset      gotta give the action an a tho       loved the car chases  made all the fast  furious movies look like comparative dog shit       a relatively easy hurdle 
Jun 12 2015,positive,mad max fury road is the best apocalyptic movie i have ever seen great action bizarre but crazy fun characters and badass looking junkyard cars recommended see this film
Jun 12 2015,positive,great music great action sequences great actors and actresses the story was a little weak but that didnt stop this movie from being amazing
Jun 12 2015,positive,wasnt as great as i thought it would be i thought the mel gibson version was much better
Jun 12 2015,positive,lots of great special effects i like it not alotta words
Jun 12 2015,positive,hands down best friggin movie ive ever seen already paid to see it twice i hate paying for movies i just wait for them to hit netflix or hbo go and am planning to drag my respective sets of parents to go see it another two times at least
Jun 12 2015,positive,my brain feels like scrambled eggs from the first scene it is nonstop action millers style with todays advances make visuals possible in a way ive never seen theron is great as the heroine hardy is good but theres no attachment with the origin story being so many years ago go see it your neighbors will file a noise complaint if you wait for it on bluray
Jun 12 2015,positive,i really enjoyed from start to finish
Jun 12 2015,positive,pretty badass love the guy with the guitar
Jun 12 2015,negative,erm  what rubbish  even charlize theron in boots corset and leather pants couldnt save it
Jun 12 2015,positive,insane action no story
Jun 12 2015,neutral,enjoyable ride but basically no plot
Jun 12 2015,positive,one for the action junkies  so in the postapocalyptic future where fuel is used as currency max tom hardy is forced into an alliance with furiosa charlize theron  they attempt to outrun multiple factions of bad guys all of which are pursuing them for a plethora of different reasons  i dont want to call this overhyped i really dont but i dont know what other word to use for it  when a film is sitting on a 98 at rottentomatoes and is currently considered to be the 38th best film of all time according to the unbiased voters on imdb its either just me or people are in cahoots  this is really giving me interstellar flashbacks because while i do recognize elements that work in both films i failed to connect on that level of full blown adoration that almost everybody else has for the film  if you love action and that is the only thing that you ask for out of your action movies by all means this is your ticket and i would like to start this off with all of the positives about mad max fury road  the action is extremely well choreographed and filmed and is shot in such a way that you never have any doubt exactly what is going on its not like a transformers movie where its just a bunch of metal clashing together you feel every single hit and crash  the majority of the stunts and effects were done practically which makes it all the more impressive  all of the designs are cool from the disturbing mutilated characters to the vehicles that have been cobbled together from spare parts  there are so many bizarre touches and so much attention to detail it goes a long way to building this postapocalyptic world  all of the effort was made which makes it all the more disappointing that i only liked it and didnt fall madly in love with it  the action is all great but where mad max fury road comes up short is well pretty much everywhere else  you are thrust into the thick of the action so quickly and it wastes no time on stuff like character development  you know what helps an action sequence  caring about whether your protagonist survives or not  i wanted to care but this film has other interests set as priorities  the writing doesnt sparkle and i cant think of a single quote off the top of my head when i just watched this three days prior  the pacing on this is unorthodox having two extensive car chases at the beginning and the end and having all of the slim plot crammed into the middle  also theres all this hullabaloo going around about how feminist this is when i really think people have that confused with it just featuring a capable female protagonist dont get me wrong its still a good thing but theres really nothing about this that screams feminism  i feel that i appreciated this more than i actually ended up liking it and i think ive reached an age where this brand of insanity doesnt appeal to me the way that it potentially could have had i been a decade younger
Jun 12 2015,positive,great movie a must see in 3d
Jun 12 2015,positive,australianborn directorwriter george miller has had one interesting career not only is he responsible for the cult 1980s action series featuring his vengeance driven cop max rockatansky but he has four oscar nods under his belt for such unlikely fare as the family film babe best picture and best adapted screenplay his susan sarandon medical drama lorenzos oil best original screenplay and the animated penguin musical happy feet the 2006 oscarwinner for best animated feature he also directed one of my favorite guilty pleasures 1987s the witches of eastwick     now he returns to the series that made him famous but this time with all the technical power of cgi behind him he uses it to dazzling effect this is the biggest baddest maddest max ever almost the entire two hours is nonstop road warrior action max is rescued from being a universal blood donor to one of the vile immortan joes henchmen by the divine charlize theron more like he holds her hostage for a ride out of the desert and rightly so as her flight away from the desolate capitol is what nearly gets him killed in the first place she is fleeing with a gaggle of joes hostage brides and joe launches his full army of highoctane vehicles after her every action sequence that follows is a heavy metal barrage capable of shaking a theater to the ground a great deal of the impossiblelooking stunt work is apparently real and miller claims to use cgi only when necessary like when he throws some fire tornados into the mix     tom hardy the dark knight rises inception is your typical action cypher  almost silent pained enigmatic we dont know him at all i venture to say hes the weak link in an otherwise exemplary effort but theron totally owns as imperator furiosa  a femme fatale with a bionic arm and a relentless drive to rid herself of the maledominated apocalypse     is this a feminist manifesto as some detractors have claim those detractors by the way are commonly called male chauvinist pigs you bet it is one man one bullet is a just a sampling of the dogma spouted by the few free women still struggling to survive in the desert thats what comes of a society where sexual slavery and human dairy farms are the norm     miller coaxed veteran oscarwinning cinematographer john seale the english patient cold mountain the talented mr ripley out of retirement to do this film and for that cinema lovers should be rejoicing
Jun 12 2015,positive,its interesting to see a reimagining of a cult classic where you instantly know this take on the series will become a cult classic of its own a very high paced action flick that still manages to keep your attention however it seemed to follow the storyline of furiosa rather than max but it worked
Jun 12 2015,positive,well done very well done save for the change of the main man and plot brings me back to the original movies in so many ways everything is over the top and insanely wild just as it should be george miller nailed this one in every which way possible
Jun 12 2015,positive,bizzare film fast paced action from start till finish very violent and disturbing in places have never seen a mqad maz fil mbefore but might want to go and check out the others
Jun 12 2015,negative,meh no plot utterly uninteresting
Jun 12 2015,positive,could a blood transfusion count as the best love kiss in a movie ever
Jun 12 2015,positive,in my humble opinion damn just damn    we need more movies to be as bold and risky as that in todays world fury road brings a grit back to cinema thats been missing probably since the last mad max movie which was 3 decades ago by the way i dont have enough words to describe my satisfaction with fury road but i will say its a work of art and i hope it goes down in history as such i am inspired and grateful to be able to say that i saw possibly the best mad max film on the big screen    as the world fell it was hard to know who was more crazy me or everyone else max rockatanksy    my rating  1010  i typed 98 at first but then i thought whatever stop beating around the bush this earned it
Jun 12 2015,positive,bought popcorn and didnt even make it half way because i couldnt move from how fantastic a film this was
Jun 11 2015,negative,what a waste of time
Jun 11 2015,positive,really cool action movie very violent lots of cool action shots
Jun 11 2015,positive,everything i wanted out of a mad max movie the craziness tops the other movies oh what a day what a lovely day
Jun 11 2015,positive,best action movie in years with adrenaline pumping action likable characters and beautiful shots and design go watch it and witness
Jun 11 2015,negative,good effects but zero on plot character development and context  the second half of the movie is the first half in reverse  this is the poster child for mindless action
Jun 11 2015,positive,brilliant  great to see max back in action
Jun 11 2015,positive,this is one of the best action movies seen in the recent decades  feels like a rollercoaster ride  buckle up get set go
Jun 11 2015,positive,it redefined the genre action it was just amazing the characters were very interesting if youre looking for an awesome movie this is the one
Jun 11 2015,positive,dont laugh it was too much action for me i didnt want to see it but my husband did and i am a good wife just not my kind of movie he watches all my chick flicks so i watch these kind of action packed violent crazy fight scene adrenaline rush manly movies with him if thats youre thing  you will love it
Jun 11 2015,positive,thiswasgreat best action movie in a while things get pretty wacky
Jun 11 2015,positive,pleasantly surprised action packed  entertaining
Jun 11 2015,positive,a nice new twist on a great classic
Jun 11 2015,positive,wish that max had gone with the wives and furiosa in the end
Jun 11 2015,positive,mad max fury road is much more than a reboot of the iconic mel gibson trilogy its a reboot for all action films although this film is screaming with action for nearly the entire 2 hours the immersive universe developed by george miller creates a complex set of characters that are grounded junkiexl also provides a massive and sweeping score that brings only amplifies the action more so most notably in the motorcycle ambush scene overall an intense film with outstanding stunt work visual effects and great writing a doesnt do this film justice it will ride eternal in valhalla shiny and chrome
Jun 11 2015,negative,am i the only one who thought there was little to no plot and absolutely zero character development what did i miss i prefer films with more substance i suppose
Jun 11 2015,positive,action packed thrill ride from start to finish whose story is linear but interesting
Jun 11 2015,positive,will ignite the fuel within you you will get pumped
Jun 11 2015,positive,in any other hands this could have been a disaster but george miller does a  spectacular job  of mixing the absurd spectacle of action with a strangely compelling story its amazing how good miller is with this franchise
Jun 11 2015,negative,oftentimes i dont let reviewsscores determine if im going to see a movie but with mad max and pitch perfect 2 both being on screen that weekend my wife and i waited to make that decision until we were the ticket window seeing how strongly it scored here at rotten tomatoes i figured how bad could it be     well for the two hours or so i pretty much came away thinking what i spent my time watching was just a prolonged car chase followed by another when the stupid guy jamming on the guitar for seemingly the whole movie was thrown from his vehicle toward the end i was so tempted to bounce out of my chair and let out a big cheer while charlize theron was solid as was tom hardy the lack of any real plot to speak of was the death of this movie     you can put great actors on a screen spend plenty of movie on effects and costumes all of which this movie provides in spades but with no plotscript to lean on it all falls apart in the end
Jun 11 2015,negative,what a pure total crap of a movie this was total waste of money
Jun 11 2015,positive,the best movie i have seen all year
Jun 11 2015,positive,this is a different breed of movie it immerses you in the fast paced nightmare that is their lives it is an instant favorite 1110
Jun 11 2015,negative,i truly hated this film and couldnt wait for it to be over i cannot believe this film has such high ratings on here the lead actor tom hardy was so stale and boring to watch i was watching the movie and realizing that they still hadnt gotten to the full plot of all of the characters and i just wanted the movie to be over as fast as possible i grew up seeing the original mad max and went into this with no expectations other than i hope its good i really enjoyed the first as a kid had no plans to compare the two and i didnt this simply sucked the only thing i can say positive about it and what earned it one full star was the actor nicholas hoult he was actually very good and entertaining he kept me from walking out i also will say that some of the visual scenes were well done i was just so annoyed i wasted 2 hours plus what seems like 25 minutes of commercials and previews on this movie i want that back i also want my money back
Jun 11 2015,positive,i did not want to see this movie because im a 1st generation mad max fan but i actually liked this film  35 stars means i can withstand constant repeats on cable but it wasnt really memorableexcept the guitar playerlol
Jun 11 2015,positive,nonstop twists and turns and fun
Jun 11 2015,positive,plenty of high octane action well developed characters and awesome score drive this welcome return to the bush with mad max
Jun 11 2015,negative,terrible terrible terrible  bad plot stupid vehicles that make no sense bad acting
Jun 11 2015,positive,a great cinematic experience with awesome action and driving sequences
Jun 11 2015,positive,mad max fury road is yet another postapocalyptic action film  violent and disturbing the script is unbearably thin and is essentially one long chase scene top marks for breath taking cinematography and great camera work
Jun 11 2015,positive,immerses you in the world
Jun 11 2015,positive,i went into this movie theater bling it was going to suck balls instead i was treated to a 2 hour celebration of gory playful insanity  if thats even a thing also i cant say enough how much more impact the practical special effects had on my feelings for this movie truly astounding im so glad this was done instead of relying on cgi the story was good too probably the best story since the original mad max in 1980 or 81 i cant remember also i saw this in imax and holy shorts it made a huge difference
Jun 11 2015,positive,not sure if this was a remake sequel or prequel but there was no backstory or depth to the characters not for someone who hasnt followed mad max religiously anyway a good entertaining movie none the less with great effects
Jun 11 2015,negative,bad b movie nothing to do with the original and still great mel gibson movies first of all max hardly speaks the only connection is the voice over at the start of the movie  maybe if it had a been a stand alone knock off but trying to get in on the mad max story with this was a waste  it totally misses the mark
Jun 11 2015,positive,really an amazing movie would watch again and again action packed and keeps you going but also packs an emotional punch
Jun 11 2015,positive,absolutely the best movie in the franchise fury road may not focus on max for the most part but all the characters are interesting and wellacted the fast paced and practical action sequences are phenomenal and i was engaged every single second there are a few smaller things that i wish were better but i can ignore them even though the movie is overhyped at this point i still highly recommend it 9510
Jun 11 2015,positive,this film was awesome start to finish it was done beautifully by the original director and theron plays a great performance there is little cgi in the film which i love and there are mainly props i saw it in 3d so everything really jumped out at you and all in going to say is if you loved the original mad max you will love this one
Jun 11 2015,positive,not a huge action fan but this was a pretty good
Jun 10 2015,positive,best movie i have ever seen a true masterpiece
Jun 10 2015,negative,possibly a good movie if you are a 13 yr old boy  truly disgusting unsettling action from start to finish  it was a waste of 2 hours for me
Jun 10 2015,positive,this movie rocks one of the best action films ive seen in very long time probably in my top 5 of all time im excited to see it again
Jun 10 2015,positive,carsexplosionsgunsbulletsboompunchstabvroomflamethrowing electric guitar on the hood of a monster truck    yea i liked it
Jun 10 2015,positive,mad max simply put is the best movie of this decade so far
Jun 10 2015,negative,it is one long violent chase scene  way too long  very little character development  i was so bored
Jun 10 2015,negative,boring and mindless zzzzz
Jun 10 2015,positive,what an exceptional movie at times preposterous and gaudy its searing pace and energy leap off the screen some production elements scream australian made but all in all a decent reboot
Jun 10 2015,positive,if you love action you will have a hard time finding a better movie this is perfect for fans of the mad max franchise but you dont need to watch the others to enjoy it the main bad guy is played by the same actor as toecutter you decide if it is the same character 
Jun 10 2015,positive,mad max fury road could just possibly be the greatest action film of the decade it boasts some of the best special effects and direction put on screen and is most definitely the next big action movie landmark a
Jun 10 2015,positive,could almost be a silent film as the amazing visuals pretty much tell the story
Jun 10 2015,positive,theres a scene where mad max fights a man playing an electric guitar that shoots flames
Jun 10 2015,positive,the ending could of been better
Jun 10 2015,positive,if i could give this movie six stars i would
Jun 10 2015,positive,shouldnt that be mentally incapacitated max in todays pc concious era anyway fury road is a satisfying reprise of the original mad max 2 road fight before the original franchise got plain silly tom hardy  charlize theron are credible as hardened road warriors the baddies are suitable villainous so sit back and watch the fun
Jun 10 2015,positive,this flick is very well done  nice visuals decent acting decent script and lots of action  for any fans of the original movies i highly recommend this one  just dont expect a deep or intricate plot
Jun 10 2015,positive,combines the best elements of all its predecessors into something familiar yet entirely new theres real humanity buried below the madness and its mythic qualities are almost as strong as in the road warrior at times even surpassing it filmmaking of the highest calibre a crescendo of diesel carnage and insanity wrapped in a glorious 70s exploration aesthetic  910
Jun 10 2015,positive,entertaining rode rage mayhem the cat and mouse chase through the outback
Jun 10 2015,positive,loved this movie had very low expectations but turned out to be a great action film and you cant go wrong when tom hardy is in a movie
Jun 10 2015,positive,not nice stories or characters yet somehow interesting and escapist these films have a style and story outside of the normal hollywood sugar zone
Jun 10 2015,positive,on a par with the first installments and that is some achievement

Jun 10 2015,neutral,thesis  women are not objects  and those who treat them like objects are ugly  irony most of the female actors seemed more like objects than relatable people with hopes and fears
Jun 10 2015,positive,mad max is simply a terrific popcorn flick and the creators seem to know that it wisely avoids attempting any more than the minimum necessary amount of character development aiming to do no more than simply give us characters real enough to care about and also sticks to one simple theme which allows a very large chunk of the run time to be taken up by roaring action scenes as post apocalyptic cars engage in thrilling chases and battles dont wait for dvd as between the action and the beautifully shot setting this is definitely one for the big screen it wont change any lives or win any oscars but mad max ranks among the most fun ive ever had at the movies
Jun 10 2015,positive,had real doubts going in whether tom hardy could pull off the character  luckily the rest of the movie was so good that he was necessary only as a plot device to carry the story forward  tom hardy  the truck
Jun 10 2015,positive,raw fast paced dark and thrilling thats it minimalist dialogue
Jun 10 2015,positive,im not the biggest fan of the mad max trilogy but i love the films and despite being the least liked thunderdome is my favourite despite of its flaws to me its the most complex and the one that comes out more as a film and has all the things that makes a film more importantly the story    so when the trailers for fury road came out i was super hyped and it was definitely one of my most hyped films to see in 2015 i couldnt stop thinking what miller would do with 150 million and the trailers made it look like an epic non stop action film with classic visuals just pure insane action like no other film then critics and audiences acclaimed it to the point of being an instant classic and is now an oscar contender then the score came out and i loved it so much i couldnt stop listening and it made my expectations even higher so i went to imax with my expectations at an all time high and saw it    and i was so disappointed i couldnt stop thinking what was i missing since everyone loves it sure the visuals are insanely good the stunts are breathtaking the score is a killer the performances are great it has originality to spare the production design is an oscar winner its so inventive i mean the cars are insane and the costumes are brilliant but all the rest pales in comparison    i never went expecting a complex story or even much dialogue but i was surprised that there was no story and no dialogue to the point i was a little bit bored one time or two i couldnt stop thinking how this could be an oscar contender with no story or dialogue and how was the film moving along but this wasnt my biggest disappointment at all it was the action because i really went for the action and it was just ok sure it was very realistic and all but the production videos were a lot more realistic and exciting the film had a mad look that was cool but takes a lot of the realism and excitement and feels weird    i didnt like the choreography it was just so simple and had a weird rhythm there were parts where nothing happened i couldnt find a single piece of action that i truly liked or was excited just things happening and most of the problem was the edition that mad look also mad max felt like a secondary character just going along that wouldnt be a problem if furiosa was a great character but she wasnt i couldnt relate to any character because they had no story no dialogue they were just insane people with great looks doing insane things    overall i cant feel nothing but disappointment and sure the technical parts are almost perfect the cinematography the sound the production design the visuals are insanely good but all the rest pales in comparison no story nothing i could relate to not even the action that is so blunt and simplistic even with its real stunts and all this is the weakest of all mad max films this film is hugely overrated and its another one i cant share the same opinion the world has but since everyone loves it so much i must be the problem im not saying the film isnt good i just cant agree with everyone i just cant see what makes it so great this was one of the most strangest experiences at the movies i ever had
Jun 10 2015,positive,this movie was much better th  an anything ive seen in awhile
Jun 10 2015,negative,this was the worst fucking film ive ever seen
Jun 10 2015,positive,non stop action and awesome makeup work yet tastefully done loved it
Jun 10 2015,positive,surprisingly good  and here here for an old guy making a cool comeback directing splash
Jun 10 2015,positive,pure amazing over the top madness
Jun 10 2015,positive,although i liked it and it had great visuals i didnt get all the hype  there was almost no dialogue and it was riddled with plot holes  i hope they make another and spend some time explaining things
Jun 10 2015,positive,the most cadas movie lol
Jun 10 2015,positive,as far as genre fare goes it doesnt get much better than this  topnotch practical effects and cg only when absolutely necessary astounding vision and just all round excellence from everyone involved  not much else to say
Jun 10 2015,positive,george miller is the enemy of exposition he does not waste time telling the audience what they just saw he shows us with the most deft hand and skill imaginable since seeing road warrior when it first came out i knew this man was one of the best director visionaries alive and so far ahead of his time during rw my jaw hit the floor and i sat in my chair in stunned silence long after it ended the usher had to kick me out instead of driving home like a happy zombie i bought a 2nd ticket and went along for the same ride with equal enthusiasm awe and respect then king miller went on to change gears with babe and happy feet  talk about diversity and talent babe had more heart and emotion than any cheesy romance i had ever seen and deserved to be nominated for the academy award for best picture why people objected to that honor is beyond me     what followed after the less than stellar thunderdome cant win them all was 30 years of copycat action movies that could never reach the standard that george miller set forth its almost as if gm came back to maxs world to tell them all  no no no thats not how you make an action movie have i taught you nothing with my work  then proceeded to show them once again how it should be done with fr im guessing that the bar has been raised so high into the clouds that every movie studio except warner is freaking out by the lesson mr miller just taught them all     fast forward to fury road a crowning epic that defies logic and words to describe this movie could have worked without any dialogue the minimal words spoken were precious gems treated with great respect without loud blaring organ music drowning it out im yelling at you interstellar there was plenty of dialogue and explanation with the visuals providing all that the viewer needed to follow this profound and relevant story sure there is lots of cg but it is woven in so organically that you dont even notice  the flow between live stunts and post enhancement is seamless and elegant this is unlike the avengers that makes me sick with claustrophobic cg and so many other movies that cant sell a story without blasting you with snazzy technology     ive seen fr 3 times and am writing my first review for a movie george miller should win every award in the book and i expect it to be nominated for every oscar category expect perhaps screenplay  bully to that if you spend the time following george millers brilliant career hearing his interviews and understanding the passion and fortitude it took to make this astounding movie then you would come to appreciate what happens when you authentically combine love and art     and lets not forget to thank warner bros for having the faith and pocketbook to finance this triumph they had as much trust in mr millers skill and vision as his loyal fans ive never seen the fast and furious movies and cant imagine how i would react to stunts that would seem like kids games compared to the masterful choreography in fury road and how is it that no one was killed or badly injured on the set that is testament to the great care that gm and his team put into all the preproduction storyboarding and precision execution the story of the making of fr would be as entertaining as the final product
Jun 10 2015,positive,a furiously fun romp but thats where it ends for all the critics cooing over the feminist overtones i found the film falling to hit the story sweet spot
Jun 10 2015,positive,must see of the summer
Jun 10 2015,positive,best action movie since guardians of the galaxy but in an entirely different class best movie this year
Jun 10 2015,positive,came out with nothing bad to say and still dont which fucking never happens for the films i see
Jun 10 2015,positive,an instant classic two hours of perfect cinema filled with stunning performances beautiful visuals and a story which makes you to want to see it again thank you george miller
Jun 10 2015,positive,max is caught up in an intense chase with furiosa looking for her home    an updated mad max movie for a new generation fury road takes a look at another of maxs adventures in the postapocalyptic wasteland this time he is taken in to a citadel under the rule of immortan joe maxs chance for escape comes when something is taken and a ruthless pursuit ensues    the film is basically an epic chase that doesnt let up until the very end action packed with a thumping soundtrack and visuals to amaze while some of the computer influence in the effects shows there is also some of the familiar sped upslowed down sequences from prior mad max outings while the impact and violence seems a little tame in comparison    still an enjoyable action flick though
Jun 10 2015,positive,not that i needed to watch the first movies before this one but since i didnt watch them and i just watched this one it was amazing if you love to watch things blow up in a very awesome non micheal bay way
Jun 10 2015,positive,mad max fury road is one hell of a ride
Jun 9 2015,positive,who killed the world  es max o es el niño del desierto
Jun 9 2015,positive,best action r rated movie of 2015
Jun 9 2015,positive,awesome remake  much better than the first in almost way very surprised
Jun 9 2015,positive,mad max fury road is justly regarded by many as the best action film of the decade so far spectacularly gripping from start to finish the film showers its viewers with moments of awe and insanity with the ability to bring them back down to earth with emotional and harshly realistic aspects whilst tom hardy is faultless in his banelike performance charlize theron and her band of freedom fighters steal the show george miller thoroughly demonstrates his skill as a director providing a magical yet scarily realistic portrayal of his imagined dystopian future with the use of stunning practical effects gripping action sequences and strong character development miller is able to bring his fantasy to screens in an awesome and beautiful way
Jun 9 2015,positive,i liked that it was action the whole movie but mad max didnt have that much emotion
Jun 9 2015,negative,not even close to the original weak plot horrible acting tom hardy probably say 5 words the entire movie it does have plenty of eye candy if you just want to see a bunch of cars and trucks running over each other and blowing one another up then its all for you this was pathetic
Jun 9 2015,positive,for a movie packed to the brim with spectacular mayhem and extravagant violence mad max fury road is ironically a study in minimalism george miller takes a few short minutes to paint a vivid picture of a sadistic dictator betrayed by a noble subject and then he lets all hell  seriously every ounce of it  break loose    there is effectively no character development no context and so little dialogue that the movie would have been just fine without it instead miller daringly and successfully replaces those traditional elements with relentlessly bonkers action brought to life with practical effects and an endless nightmare of visual creativity for good measure and scale the intensely personal action is framed with gorgeous wide angle shots of dessert wasteland     one could imagine that it would be exhausting to live inside the creative minds of artists like terry gilliam david lynch or rob zombie george miller who has been better known for his childrens fare in recent years apparently belongs right next to those wonderful lunatics    even though its the fourth installment of a consistently excellent series miller has delivered something wholly original theres a new bar set and miller himself might be the only filmmaker working today who has the ability to raise it
Jun 9 2015,positive,definitely  one of the best movie ever made in the history of cinema 
Jun 9 2015,positive,an exhilarating thrill ride and visual orgasm textbook example of when to use cgi and when to use practical effects
Jun 9 2015,positive,one of the best action movies this year
Jun 9 2015,positive,good entertainment for when you want to waste time
Jun 9 2015,positive,oh what a day what a lovely day
Jun 9 2015,positive,a tour de force from beginning to end george millers foray back into this desolate world grabs hold tight and never lets go the scope and intensity of the action scenes were breathtaking and never felt repetitive or overdone i tip my hat to the production crew on this film its simply visually spectacular and the sets wardrobe vehicles makeup and technical and special effects were all first rate especially the makeup and wardrobe the music was on point too tom holkenborg aka junkie xl has really come into his own since i heard bombers over ibiza from the dark knight rises tracks like brothers in arms were relentlessly powerful and tribal while softer tracks like many mothers provide warmth and comfort in this bleak world excellent performances all around thomas hoult provided the right amount of comic relief and heart to the group i thought tom hardy was superb and his portrayal of mad max was complex rich and left me wanting to see more of him and last but certainly not least charlize theron who knocked it out of the park i always love seeing more badass women in cinema and theron nailed that balance of being emotionally tender but also ferocious and tough as hell i was also pleasantly surprised that to me anyway the movie seemed like it focused more on her and her story of redemption while still leaving the door open for us to learn more about max in future stories highly recommend this film 
Jun 9 2015,positive,awesomeness stuffed with gripping action  george miller does a great job capturing the insanity of everyone in the world of mad max
Jun 9 2015,positive,different weird beautiful violent
Jun 9 2015,positive,left wing action films are en vogue nowadays and this one is among the best watch our band of misfits fight the three headed incarnations of the patriarchy the gas industry and the military industrial complex hardy is a great max however action is a bit mindnumbing towards the end only so many explosions and crashes i can watch before going and then
Jun 9 2015,positive,a heartpounding full throttle action spectacle mad max fury road is a powerhouse of a survival story
Jun 9 2015,positive,this movie truly captures the world of mad max  insanity all around and action packed
Jun 9 2015,positive,wow this is an excellent movie nonstop action from beginning to end
Jun 9 2015,neutral,pu    spoiler alerts    first if i had not seen the previous mad max movies i would probably give this 4 or 45 stars but its not my fault they hyped as part of the mad max series     first there is the lack of a plot  yes heroine takes off with bad guys wives chase ensue s end of plot    the max character felt like he could have been anybody i had no feelings for this guy a lot of flash backs to things we never saw happen and are not explained    nax the war boy turned hero brain washed all his life meets a pretty girl and voila hes cured    the vehicles  vikes where were they keeping the mechanical genius that it would have taken to build and maintain these     dont even want to discuss the idiocy of the flame throwing guitar  the guy who played it and the vehicle they transported him on i thought about walking out when it first appeared on the screen    now for a time line question  seeing as how this is supposed to take place between mad max and the road warrior  tell me exactly how max gets his pursuit special back it was crushed between 2 trucks and run over by one of them    i cant suspend disbelief quite that much
Jun 9 2015,positive,not much of a plot though that hardly matters
Jun 9 2015,positive,the purpose of a metaphor is to compare a subject to another thing so that your listener better understands the point youre trying to convey i will do that now one of my favorite metaphors for describing movies other than sandwiches and burgers is to compare them to complex machinery a movie is like a machine in that it is full of moving parts all of which work with each other to perform the machines job with many machines not all of the parts may be functioning but they still more or less work its only when all the parts work as theyre supposed to that the machine works at its optimum capacity this is how id describe mad max fury road george millers return to the franchise after a 30 year hiatus has it really been that long i regret not seeing this one in theater first viewing it on my laptop which diminished the experience for me however that did not stop me from loving this movie and my affection towards it has only grown with each subsequent viewing    fury road combines two of my favorite things about movies for a really great package big spectacle and meaningful storytelling these sometimes get mislabeled as being mutually exclusive but this film seems to be a big middle finger to that notion miller uses big action set pieces to tell a story about survivors monsters cults and the overthrowing of tyranny to set up a benevolent matriarchy that last one may seem a bit odd for mad max but thankfully the more laid back script keeps it from being too onthenose     thats another thing i like about mad max there isnt too much exposition the opening shot tells you all you need to know to get caught up on the scenario whether youre a newcomer to the franchise or a returning fan everything else important to the story is shown through visuals and character interactions for example max is very different from how we last saw him and i dont mean that hes played by a different actor a lot of time has passed since he last interacted with another human being but this is never told directly to you instead the audience is trusted to figure out by the way max behaves hes not so good at talking anymore speaking in low grunts and pantomiming with a shotgun in order to order people around likewise we know that immorten joes group of followers the war boys are cultists because of their mad devotion and willingness to throw away their lives even though the word cult is never mentioned once in the film i think the mad max movies are a great example of how you can show instead of tell in order to make a more compelling story    there wasnt a single moment that the film lost me miller understands the audiences need for practical effects mostly keeping the cg invisible to viewers the only really obvious use of cg is the crazy scary sandstorm with the tornadoes and lightning bolts and man wasnt that really cool yeah this whole movie is cool which is important for an action movie thankfully everythings always moving forward nothing stopped    i could go on and on but this is just an rt review im doing for fun if this was for a publication id be more thorough and professionalsounding but nobodys going to read this but me if you do happen to stumble upon this and wish i wrote more well sue me
Jun 9 2015,positive,i expected an overly violent movie  but it was very enjoyable good mix of action and interesting characters  i especially liked the vehicle with the guitarist on the front and drums on back
Jun 9 2015,neutral,the cool action sequences arent enough to make the entire movie interesting when the character depth is about as interesting as rotting cheese
Jun 9 2015,positive,having never seen the old mad max movies i had no idea what this film was about  all i had was a coworkers recommendation  since there was hardly any dialogue i was totally lost for the first half hour or so  as the film went on i caught on to the basic almost nonexistent plot  it got slightly interesting as it went on but the constant noise eventually put me to sleep  ill probably want to see it again when it comes to redbox to see what i missed  i did like the actors and the sets  the action wasnt bad but there wasnt enough dialogue and story to keep me engaged
Jun 9 2015,positive,amazing non stop action filmsit back hold on for the next 2 hrs
Jun 9 2015,positive,story isnt great but the action more than makes up for it both tom hardy and charlize theron are great in this
Jun 9 2015,negative,folks seem really desperate this summer for good movies to rate this one so high the story was confused it seemed to start nowhere and end up nowhere the characters were flat and boring really disappointed by this
Jun 9 2015,positive,mindblowing insanity
Jun 9 2015,positive,this is how movies should be made best action movie since drive
Jun 9 2015,positive,intense and ludicrous enough said
Jun 9 2015,positive,the best action film in years  a must see on the big screen and in 3d format
Jun 9 2015,positive,a perfect film a nonstop thrill ride thatll leave you with your mouth gasping in awe and your heart emotionally torn so far the best film of the year by far
Jun 9 2015,positive,exciting action packedand a stunning visual cinematic movie  although this movie has a lot of action something seemed to be missing as it didnt have much of a storyline the acting was good but a bit weak at times its defiantly a must watch if you want too watch an action packed movie
Jun 9 2015,positive,balls to the wall from start to finish best action film for years
Jun 9 2015,positive,the biggest problem to seeing this film late is all the hype surrounding it what most are saying is true great action flick but what separates it from the rest is that we are more or less dropping in to a very detailed world without a lot of explanation or exposition the viewer is playing catch up most of the time the best scifi films do that the things they see and do are common to their world and dont need to explain what they are doing to others around them   i look forward to the next chapter
Jun 9 2015,negative,saw it in 3d very disappointed not worth the time or money maybe see it as a 5 dollar dvd but still wasting your time imo
Jun 9 2015,negative,utter drivel looking at my watch all the way through hopeless dialogue which thankfully was inaudible for the first half hour
Jun 9 2015,positive,charlize theron rocks in this filmthis movie is great and we finally have a female leading role in a big budget action film welcome to 2015 hollywood
Jun 9 2015,positive,best action movie ever
Jun 9 2015,negative,i dont get what the heck is going on around that crap probably the worst movie i ever seen  got seriously bored and clearly not worth the money i paid to see it
Jun 9 2015,positive,very good and well paced film which probably has a cult following now
Jun 9 2015,negative,so why wasnt this just a spin off film mad was hardly present and when he was hardy was wearing his bane mask
Jun 9 2015,positive,if i could see just one movie for the rest of my life itd be this one
Jun 9 2015,positive,a visual masterpiece was blown away by everything from the music to composition the story was quite interesting as there was not much dialogue added a sense of mystery to who is mad max overall a fantastic film a must see
Jun 9 2015,positive,love the dust and metal hardcore girl power and stunts was on going warriors for real action packed good for to enjoy theaters will be very rewarding this summer
Jun 8 2015,positive,watching this and going back to then watch the original trilogy is a bumpy ride this film is epic its as simple as that
Jun 8 2015,positive,great movie loved it
Jun 8 2015,positive,mad max fury road was visually pleasing without a doubt although some parts seemed a little too disturbing and outlandish for my taste i enjoyed it for what it was worth its a strange but solid movie
Jun 8 2015,positive,this is one of those under rated masterpieces unbelievable it took me out of the theatre amazingly done for what it did
Jun 8 2015,positive,do we care about any of the characters no except the hippy looking chic its like watch a string of police chase videos with everybody wearing sm gear after the original what new ideas does it really bring you need seeds to start plant life  young men dont think for themselves much  good grief was expecting better on that score so while i didnt hate it is not exactly clever and cinematographic wise was nothing i hadnt seen before but it could sometimes make me laugh and i thought it did a good job with the car stunt battles recommend it if this is your thing but its miss able if youve seen the first two and expect those to be beaten by this effort not going to happen
Jun 8 2015,negative,history repeats itself in response to remakes original movie was better
Jun 8 2015,negative,some elements of the movie were not properly developed like the theme of mental illness or the origin stories of some characters like the main bad guy who shows distinct burn marks but were not told why also there are many great characters in the movie but very few are developed beyond basic features which makes them unidimensional the main character speaks of there not being hope but then brings hope this contradiction might have been intended but if it was then it was not developed clearly a such
Jun 8 2015,positive,mindblowing  miller has set the bar high with this one and in doing so has passed the torch to the next generation of filmmakers as if saying  boys and girls this is how its done  masterful
Jun 8 2015,positive,i dont think i can say much that hasnt already been said about it but those stilts people tho this movie was great but i want a whole nother movie just about them
Jun 8 2015,positive,this movie is intense thrilling and everything you would expect and anticipate from a mad max movie while the movie has absolutely no plot the action and visual effects make up for the loss the entire plot of the movie is that a few groups of strange looking road ragers drive down a postapocolyptic australian road only to find that there is nothing therethen they drive back up the roadthat is literally the entire storyline not being a huge fan of thrillers or car chases which is pretty much the whole shebang i did not think i would like this movie as much as i did guitar solos cars getting smashed and speared explosions strange looking midgets foot fungus fighting getting high on chrome spray paint body parts being ripped off im not going to spoil it and not having much character dialogue or back stories created a suprisingly good movie trust me you wont be driving slow on the way home from the theater
Jun 8 2015,positive,achieved what it was aiming for lost half a star because even though its an action movie doesnt mean it cant have a stronger plot with more fleshed out characters
Jun 8 2015,positive,a fantastic film and a creative tour de force
Jun 8 2015,positive,for what the film lacks in plot it certainly makes up for with its action set peices and film making style in a time where action films after action films grow tiresome and plain fury road delves into its chaotic dystopia with style mad max himself may be the supporting grunting mask wearing character in his own film but with this much fire in the heart of it you wont care
Jun 8 2015,negative,literally the dumbest most idiotic ridiculous and absurd movie i have ever seen the action is cool but seriously why is this movie so popular it freakin sucks
Jun 8 2015,negative,horrible movie kudos to the adventurous action scenes however the plot and character depth was nonexistent by the second hour of the movie i was anxiously waiting to leave the theater
Jun 8 2015,positive,pure action packed goodness
Jun 8 2015,positive,the movie essentially consisted of action sequence after action sequence while entertaining there was very little dialogue and the characters were difficult to connect with in this story no one is truly evil or good theres  obviously a grey line of moral ambiguity resulting from their survival extinct
Jun 8 2015,positive,best movie ever dying to see it again
Jun 8 2015,positive,a visual masterpiece that scarcely needs dialogue as it tells a simple story of females trying to escape a dystopian waterscarce mad dictatorship mad max has barely a dozen lines as this is all about a furious badass woman
Jun 8 2015,positive,absolutely loved it
Jun 8 2015,positive,only works if you embrace the absurdity
Jun 8 2015,positive,was a good movie but parts also left me thinking that was pointless its also billed as 30yrs after first movie well tell you max wouldnt look like tom bludy hardy if aged 30 yrs that bludy guitar player youd think if going into battle get somecunt that can at least play guitar and tom hardy couldve at least used an aussie accent to stick with original max being from oz
Jun 8 2015,positive,loved it way better than i thought it was going to be a delightful surprise
Jun 8 2015,positive,you wouldnt fall asleep during this movie if you havent slept for weeks  easily one of the best action movies of the new millenium and the best mad max movie
Jun 8 2015,negative,just one long road trip with battles about as little plot as a porn movie
Jun 8 2015,positive,relentless frenetic excessive overthetop exhilarating empowering gorgeous and so so enjoyable it outdoes all the poor rehashed and lazy action movies everywhere turns other franchise on their head and tells them to go do their homework it accomplishes the promises of road warrior and beyond thunderdome all i want is to go back
Jun 8 2015,positive,lots of awesome action a lot isnt special effects poor plot development i was pretty engaged though and sitting on the edge of my seat the whole time
Jun 8 2015,negative,reminded me of a modern nascar race running in circles and going nowhere
Jun 8 2015,negative,not impressedthe story was absent which the actors little to nothing to work with
Jun 8 2015,positive,while i had some problems with it and havent seen the previous films which is my fault mad max fury road is a excellent action movie it boasts some of the best practical effects ive ever seen just wow and some of the best action sequences since ever just the fight between max and furiosa was one of the best fight scenes ive ever seen its raw scary fast paced action throughout everyone did an exceptional job despite tom hardy doing an amazing performance i have to say nicholas hoult stole the show for me as his character was given direction and was given the chance to redeem himself in a mad world
Jun 8 2015,positive,exhilarating crazy jarring and greatly performed action scenes acting and direction
Jun 8 2015,positive,non stop pulsepounding action sequences interesting characters and deep and engaging lore expertly merged as one even after multiple viewings of the 2 hour movie i felt like i was only scratching the surface of george millers masterpiece go see it now
Jun 8 2015,positive,no story but the action was parts were great
Jun 8 2015,positive,pure action but not a lot of substance it was good but just needed more character development kinda felt like the story was just thrown together
Jun 8 2015,positive,what a rollercoaster ride great action packed movie
Jun 8 2015,positive,awesome  the cast and crew delivered
Jun 8 2015,positive,great film one of the best of the year without a doubt  the story and acting was great the costumes effects choreography sets vehicles were excellent  the highest grades go to the amazing stunts and how the director weaved them seamlessly with the story  this is the best mad max film made and an entertaining film from start to finish  note this film is rated r and is not a family film  this film takes a bleak and heartless time and manages to find humanity and heart where it is conspicuously missing
Jun 8 2015,positive,rarely do films come as visually enthralling and thought provoking as george millers  mad max fury road but above all its the masterful execution of both traits that will leave you in awe for some time to come
Jun 8 2015,positive,this movie was amazing it was the film of the year for mehad to see it twice
Jun 8 2015,positive,a frenetic heartpounding intoxicating ride from start to finish flawless effects coupled with a superb score and above average performances
Jun 7 2015,positive,awesome non stop action loved it
Jun 7 2015,positive,this movie is basically one big car chase from start to finish
Jun 7 2015,positive,charlize theron is excellent the rest of the movie is not but if you like action adventure aka endless killing this is your dream movie come true    the special effects are excellent and the cinematography is good but still it was only a road movie with simplistic plot
Jun 7 2015,positive,best actionfilm in the last 25 years
Jun 7 2015,positive,great action flick with just one big problem it shouldnt have been called mad max it should have been furiosa and the brides
Jun 7 2015,negative,shallow  lots of stunts and spectacular effects  plot so weak is was effectively not there  very little connection to the first and best max
Jun 7 2015,positive,exceeded my expectation
Jun 7 2015,positive,good movie i liked it specially because it show us how the big guys run the world wile the rest is dying that sounds familiar right
Jun 7 2015,positive,wooooow it was the best movie of the year
Jun 7 2015,positive,this movie is a redneck motor heads dream
Jun 7 2015,positive,a masterpiece of an action film
Jun 7 2015,positive,ive never seen the other mad max movies but after seeing this one i really want to  fury road is ridiculously entertaining and the most fun ive had at the movies since the first avengers  i had a huge smile on my face for the majority of the movie reveling in the destruction on screen  the plot is extremely simple basically just an escort mission but it accomplishes what it needs to it makes us invested enough in the characters goal to add tension to the action sequences and make us emotionally invested in their success  in the course of the two hour runtime about 90 minutes of the film is an action sequence  miraculously it never gets tiring take note michael bay and is consistently entertaining  the film constantly finds new ways to entertain the hell out of you with stellar stunts and massive destruction which are mostly used with practical effects  my one gripe with the film is that the ending comes a little too abruptly and feels a bit too clean but everything leading up to that is so damn awesome i really cant be upset  i love this movie just a damn good time
Jun 7 2015,positive,this movie blew my mind
Jun 7 2015,negative,too bad i cant give less than 12 starts  awful boring no plot
Jun 7 2015,neutral,spectacularly awful loli didnt understand much of it hit it was at least entertaining
Jun 7 2015,positive,outstanding george kennedy truly is a prodigy
Jun 7 2015,positive,one of the best movies ive seen in theaters in a long timemasterful and ingenious the best story told since gladiator way better than the original
Jun 7 2015,negative,not my cup of tea a friend put it perfectly lots of fury lots of road lots of mad but very little max furiosa was a bad ass though
Jun 7 2015,positive,whether you love it or hate it i think we can all agree nothing will top the road warrior not now or in a hundred years
Jun 7 2015,negative,this movie was ok the main character sadly had only a few lines and plot was terrible
Jun 7 2015,positive,this movie is jam packed with action and suspense a proper character development led to a great cinematic experience
Jun 7 2015,positive,one of most thrilling movies of all time breathtaking action and fast phased thriller keep you at the edge of the chair enjoyed the movie
Jun 7 2015,positive,seldom do i walk out of movies blinking my eyes in disbelief and say holy shit that was a good movie this lady and gents is that kind of movie
Jun 7 2015,negative,terrible couldnt wait for it to be overwanted to leave after first 15 minutes but got curious about these high ratings and thought maybe there will be something that will change my mind didnt happen waste of time and 
Jun 7 2015,negative,i have no idea what movie these reviewers saw but it couldnt have been the terrible train wreck that i wasted 2 hours watching  it was just a bunch of nonsense violence  sorry not my type of movie at all
Jun 7 2015,positive,extravagant epic glorious picture incredible acting screenplay and stunts exceeded my expectations by far
Jun 7 2015,positive,probably the best action in a film i have ever seen and while the sentiments in the creation of each character is great the film kept the characters superficial  not a huge complaint but could have pushed it over the edge beautiful to look at my god
Jun 7 2015,positive,amazing one of the best action movies of the past couple decades charlize theron stole the show and i hope she reprises her role in sequels
Jun 7 2015,negative,worst movie ever so cheesy i think im now lactose intolerant   i have no idea how this movie is getting such high ratings because those people obviously did not watch the same drivel we watched  the only thing that could possibly redeem this movie would be to cast melissa mccarthy and adam sandler in the lead and pass it off as a spoof    i gave it 12 star because i had to give it something and some of the 3d effects were pretty cool
Jun 7 2015,positive,best action movie ive seen in a while
Jun 7 2015,positive,mad max fury road is a visceral 2 hour action sequence that keeps you on the edge of your seat until the credits roll
Jun 7 2015,positive,nearly nonstop action  little character development but fun and has the correct tone
Jun 7 2015,positive,ridiculous  bonkers  amazing
Jun 7 2015,positive,a good old action packed smash crash and crunch em up with superb visual and sound effects  story line was also much better than i expected but like all good action films its not a question of what will happen  it all about how they get you there
Jun 7 2015,positive,solid performances all the way around with the cast and mad max uses an intelligent style of thoughtful sped up fight scenes on occasion and the characters and attire are truly unique the only dissapointing factor is the whole movie is a desert setting that kind of makes you feel like your seeing the same thing
Jun 7 2015,neutral,the action in this movie was incredible but to me that was about it  way too much crazy and over the top  also max did not feel at all like he was the star  felt like charlize therons character or even that of nicolas hoult were made bigger deals of  just my opinion   i would wait for dvd
Jun 7 2015,positive,mad max fury road is by far the best movie of the year and the best mad max in the franchise theres heart pounding and pulse racing non stop action sequences and tom hardy charlize theron and nicholas hoult give great performances
Jun 7 2015,positive,2 of the most action packed hours ive ever seen
Jun 7 2015,positive,apparently tina turner lied  they did need another hero they did need to know the way home  the symbolism to what is going on in the world today is palpable in this mad max franchise film which brings it to a well deserved third star cdw
Jun 7 2015,positive,really good i had high expectations coming into this one because of all the rave reviews and i can say that i was not disappointed and it is well worth seeing    all the whacky violent zaniness from the original film returns here in spades too and we get to see some really badass women who show that you dont have to be sexually itemized to be an interesting female character
Jun 7 2015,positive,it had so much potential  the story ruined it for me
Jun 7 2015,positive,born a decade after the old mad maxmovies ive never seen them i wasnt going to see this one but got curious im glad i did since this is the best movie ive seen in ages and left me restless shaking and amazed i want more male action heroes like tom hardys max even through his trauma and torture that robs him of his speech through most of the movie his humanity survives i want no i need more female action heroes like charlizes furiosa fierce angry but with a good caring heart who gets the job done more action movies done with such thoughtfulness with such heart tangled with all the tarantinoesque bright colours and general craziness and you know the guitar guy that goddamn guitar guy
Jun 7 2015,negative,im blown away with how high the ratings are for this movie and how horrible it turned out to be ridiculous would be the only way i could describe the sequence of events that took place from beginning to end i loved the original parts of this franchise but this movie forced me to contemplate whether i should remain in my seat for the entire movie or walk out after the first 30 minutes im not sure this was even worth renting so if youre on the fence about it dont waste your time or money
Jun 7 2015,positive,brilliant fast paced movie would see again 
Jun 7 2015,positive,expected more no dialogue no story just an endless action scene
Jun 7 2015,positive,seriously one of the best movies ive seen in years if you miss out on this one consider yourself a fool
Jun 7 2015,positive,loved it tom is great as max a lot of action different for sure
Jun 7 2015,negative,after the reviews we thought it would be a good movie we were so wrong   there is absolutely nothing i liked  my husband didnt want to leave so we watched the whole thing
Jun 7 2015,positive,its a simple reimagining of the old mm films
Jun 7 2015,positive,amazingamazingamazingamazingamazing mad max is one of the few franchises that has only improved with age each film better than the last tom hardy did excellently filling mel gibsons shoes and george miller delivered the stunning visuals and memorable characters that hes become known for there are so many awesome things from fury road to talk about i know for a fact i wont be able to cover it all but the short list is furiosa furiosa furiosa furiosa furiosa kick ass lady characters whose compexities stem beyond the act of asskicking lots of disability representation and a dude playing a guitar that shoots fire while strapped onto a moving vehicle this movie is sick and if it were a person id highfive the hell out of it
Jun 7 2015,positive,pure entertainment for good or bad
Jun 7 2015,negative,best theatre ncg in spartanburg sc  not good movie
Jun 7 2015,positive,one of the coolest most original action movies i have seen in a very long time
Jun 7 2015,positive,a fantastic tourdeforce that is a visual treat for both the eyes and the mind
Jun 7 2015,positive,absolutely loved this movie fast paced high octane guzzoline fueled fun dynamic and inspired costume and set piece design really created an immersive movie only quam was a seeming underuse of hardys talents hope to see a more maxcentric storyline in the next installment
Jun 7 2015,positive,solid  an exceptional actionscifi thriller  miller perfectly calibrated his expectations for an audience and has delivered on time with all toppings present  see this one in the theater
Jun 7 2015,positive,not a bad movie some what dry then again it is english  it stars tom hardy not at his best but doing what tom hardy does best flanked by charlize theron who provides a little more clairvoyance to the credibility of both characters  needless to say you can hear bane tom hardy dark knight rises the whole time throughout the movie  it was ok  be ready for a little blood and lot of action
Jun 7 2015,positive,this is one awesome action film
Jun 7 2015,positive,when i saw this i sure had a lovely day
Jun 7 2015,negative,self indulgent too much action not enough story after the first 15 minutes i was done with the film
Jun 7 2015,positive,the best action movie ever made george miller have done the most  complex work in a movie y cant imagine the story board of this one not easy to do but the result is a visionary and exceptional movie
Jun 7 2015,positive,the entertainment value here is the originality and the dazzling images that miller manage to put together however some of the story was a bit convoluted theron definitely stills the show here so one should wonder why not change the title to furiosa mad max begins she felt more of a hero than max it felt as the movie played max as furiosas sidekick which it was probably best for the movie it made it more badass kudos to theron overall confusing at times but highly entertaining b
Jun 7 2015,positive,this movie delivers on exactly what it advertises car chases mad max and lots of violence dont go into this expecting a lot of depth but honestly that not why you go see mad max its for the visuals and man are there a lot of great ones this movie slightly suffers from too much green screen but the car chases are legit exciting having been enhanced instead of fully computer rendered max has barely any lines and the majority of the dialog is done by furiosa and nux but to be honest their characters end up being more interesting max is in his element just doing his normal survival thing but furiosa is obviously in the midst of deep emotional conflict and so is nux as he goes from bad to good also just saying guitar guy stole the movie
Jun 7 2015,neutral,shouldve had a script and been 40min shorter then itd be 4 stars
Jun 7 2015,positive,not big on story but makes up for it in action  fun 
Jun 7 2015,positive,great cinema experience not sure how well it will transfer to home watching
Jun 7 2015,positive,this movie is pretty much fast  furious on an acid trip an absolutely fantastic watch showing that it really is possible for a film to keep such high paced action though out without ever getting sick of it  to put it simply this movies actions spoke louder than its words  peace
Jun 7 2015,positive,a great movie full of tense and comedy but nothing like thunder doom mel gibson
Jun 7 2015,positive,wow this movie was a ton of fun the storys nice and simple but everything about it is perfect feels like youre transported into a new world really looking forward to seeing this again
Jun 7 2015,neutral,mad max fury road is basically one big action scene with some vaguely grunted plot supermodels in rags and a buttload of guns it may have passed the bechdel test but it didnt do a lot for feminism the best part was when they entered the giant desert dust storm thees things actually exist in real life althou maybe not with the tornados and lightning inside them but noneltheless this scene was beautifully incredible
Jun 7 2015,positive,the story line is mediocre but this movie is one action packed ride maybe one of the best action movies of all time a must watch in the theatre
Jun 7 2015,positive,by the end of this film you will not want to blink because you could miss a mere second of george millers brilliant masterpiece of a film
Jun 7 2015,positive,loved every minute
Jun 7 2015,positive,twisted as fuck but a great movie
Jun 7 2015,negative,not even close to being as good as the bmovie original
Jun 7 2015,positive,losing none of the madness and even gaining some quality in terms of storytelling fury road is packed with enough action to entertain newcomers and enough quintessential insanity to reinvigorate old fans
Jun 6 2015,positive,great movie keeps you on the edge
Jun 6 2015,positive,visually insane but the originals much better until further notice
Jun 6 2015,positive,each scene could be a set to an apocalyptic postcard set a beautiful visual journey of adrenaline cars guns and gasoline everything the fast and the furious saga wishes it could be
Jun 6 2015,negative,this movie consisted of nothing more than a single movielength chase scene with just enough plot to make it seem vaguely reasonable the crazy cool special effects are made less interesting by the lacking story and plot holes
Jun 6 2015,positive,impressive lots of action well done special effects seeing it in 3d made it even cooler
Jun 6 2015,negative,i could sht out a film better than this one to be completely honest one critic said i defy you to see a better movie this year ive seen better films this year already because pretty much every film ive ever seen was better than this this one was poorly planned out lacked logic and had absolutely no plot or point what so ever 90 of the movie was irrelevant to the plot which was almost nonexistent i dont understand how actual movie critics can call this a good movie by any means the special effects werent even done well i could tell that this was filmed in a studio and i usually cant notice that at all the props were clunky and unrealistic the characters were uninteresting even max was boring good movies have main characters people can connect with and he sucked absolutely nothing was good about this movie and the war electric guitar that shoots flame was that really necessary the movie makers clearly just tried to throw in every cool thing they could think of and throw it into one movie resulting in an absolute mess of a movie
Jun 6 2015,positive,everything an action movie should be and more
Jun 6 2015,positive,an ode to the guitar guy    eardrums pierced by 50000 watts of shrill power chords  lungs scorched by the fumes of spewing napalm   vertebrae twisted by elastic wires   body draped in scarlet pajamas  you are the fury road   they know youre coming
Jun 6 2015,positive,why are you even here you should be in the theater watching one of the best action films in years before its too late i promise its worth it just go
Jun 6 2015,positive,action the whole way through def on the edge of my seat the entire time
Jun 6 2015,positive,this is a fully loaded 100 testosterone thrill ride that any guy should see its also as im sure youve heard a great film for the ladies as the plot focuses around womens rights albeit in a postapocalyptic australia    the best part of this film is that most of the effects are real people are literally being thrown car to car vehicles are exploding and my personal favorite there is a rock star literally playing a flamethrowing guitar while riding atop a truck made of speakers    if i have any issue with the film its that mad max isnt nearly the star you could have had the same film and replaced mad max for a random new character created for a new franchise of postapocalyptic films i hope the sequel and im sure there will be one focuses on giving max the spotlight i think hardys max said 3 complete lines in the whole film
Jun 6 2015,positive,this instalment in the mad max series has put the series to prominence kudos to george miller tom hardy charlize theron and company for fury road
Jun 6 2015,positive,what a ridiculously awesome movie this world is just soo ridiculous and i love the guy that was strapped infront of the vehicle playing his flaming guitar he was soo committed to his job didnt matter that there was a fight in the background he just kept playing his guitar the chase scenes were beautifully shot too i like this world in all its ridiculousness
Jun 6 2015,negative,first half is incredibly boring  no idea how this has such high ratings
Jun 6 2015,neutral,the mutant pimped up cars are the stars in this one charlize theron was more than adequate but the max character was very poorly written directed and acted my 212 star rating is very generous
Jun 6 2015,positive,so much action i could barely handle it
Jun 6 2015,positive,fury road is an exhilarating and unforgettable experience the action scenes are unmatched flawlessly choreographed thrilling and unique the story is simple but works the cast is pretty great tom hardy charlize theron and nicholas hoult all bring their a game the characters are actually really good they heroes were people i was constantly rooting for there are even some emotional moments to be found the direction and set design are amazing and the villain is very intimidating and memorable this movie is a true cinematic experience one of the greatest times ive ever had at the theaters  and unforgettable in every way its one of the best action movies ive ever seen its fast paced exciting and well made mad max fury road gets 55 stars a
Jun 6 2015,positive,one of my favorite movies of all time and quite possibly my favorite action movie of all time i could watch this over and over again
Jun 6 2015,negative,i have no idea why this movie is getting such great reviews it honestly makes me question rotten tomatoes whom ive been heavily reliant of in the past ratings theres zero plot introduced and terrible acting the only amusement i got was from watching a weirdo dressed in latex play the guitar for 2 hours  attached to a truck surrounded by explosions could have sworn michael bay directed this
Jun 6 2015,negative,if i could give it negative stars i would literally driving to point a then turning around and going backsame garbage for two painful hours  ive had trips through western texas that were more interesting in this moviehorrible boring movie and seriously mad max had like what 8 linessooooo bad
Jun 6 2015,neutral,given the ratings apparently im wrong but the director deserves all the credit for the success of this movie the story sucks and tom hardy brings nothing to this movie the rest of the cast was good and the fx are amazing
Jun 6 2015,positive,very well made and played out film not a fan of fast forwarded action scenes
Jun 6 2015,positive,in 1979 director george miller presented the world with mad max an post apocalyptic action film that had groundbreaking action 36 years later he presents another film in the series in mad max fury road it becomes clear that he has not lost his touch fury road has some of the most exciting and entertaining action scenes again the post apocalyptic themes continue and interesting character designs and themes are displayed beautifully throughout the film although the film lacks much of a plot it more than makes up for it with breathtaking actions and solid performances from theron and hardy
Jun 6 2015,positive,george miller succeeds with this film unlike micheal bay and the transgormers series george miller has clearly stated that he is able to make 4 films that are of the same series this film is exiting and will keep you at the edge of yor seat the whole film though there is not much dialogue the film somehow manages to grasp you just by the story im not even going to talk about the crazy stutns the cinematography and sound effects are oscar worthy furiousa may be the main character the film is still about max the acting is superb its worth seeing in 3d but to understand the film completely you should see the first three films
Jun 6 2015,positive,best movie ice ever see  hands down
Jun 6 2015,negative,what a disappointment  character development plot logic dialog  no need  all were discarded to showcase monster trucks chase scenes and munitions  having thoroughly enjoyed the earlier renditions fury road left me cold particularly regarding the central character  max circa 1980 was new fresh and intriguing he was clever cunning cheeky and self sufficient  ie he was fun to watch vicariously  in contrast fury road max is just a shell of a man  sure he can handle a rifle but hes uninteresting as a character  hes nearly incapable of communicating or independent thought  furiosa the one interesting personality but even she wears thin after the first hour drags him around like a dog on a chain  save your time and money instead enjoy watching the first 3 over again or for the first time
Jun 6 2015,positive,this movie is basically a two hour chase scene with badass ladies versus gwar fans in the desert
Jun 6 2015,positive,can i give this like 6 stars
Jun 6 2015,positive,best movie ive seen in a long time
Jun 6 2015,positive,i saw a screener for this but im going to have to watch this again  this is the most metal movie i have seen an apocalyptic future where a caravan of killers in crazy vehicles is chasing down mad max and his makeshift team  this movie is so metal that they had a guitar player with an axe guitar strapped to the hood of a car shredding it as they went  the movie is great but it is overwhelming how many details are put into each scene  youll have to watch it again
Jun 6 2015,positive,good movie just a little gore for my taste
Jun 6 2015,positive,i really enjoyed this movie 
Jun 6 2015,positive,at last i get the chance to watch this muchhyped actioner in the local theatre squeezed in a thirdrate screenroom with a pretty small screen this is what i can find for a current movie enters its  third week run in cairo the hardware facilities are inferior but we should all make the best of what we can acquire    this reboot of the cult brand of mad max from the mastermind behind its original trilogy is a felicitous remedy to the generational fatigue of cgirampaged action tentpoles the world is overloaded with presently after decades of immersion into animation filmmaking paid off with an oscar trophy for happy feet 2006 with his codirectors george millers grandiose return to liveaction feature the first one after lorenzos oil in 1992 detonates the genre film enthusiasts with its cuttingedge visual spectacles which counteract the current trend with the majority of its staggering set pieces accomplished with bloodandflesh stuntmen and authentic objects other than virtual fictionalisation aided by computers more pleasingly the film has already conducts a profitable boxoffice trajectory worldwide albeit it bears a hefty budget of 150 millions     continue reading my review on my blog  thanks
Jun 6 2015,positive,very good movie and better than most of the older mad max sequels amazing visuals and action
Jun 6 2015,positive,surprisingly good lots of action good storyline
Jun 6 2015,positive,saw it once saw it twice first time i thought it couldnt be any better 2nd time it was still better without any words almost tom hardy charlize theron and nicholas holut delivers everything any movie buff must watch this dare i say it raises the bar and is at least equal to the dark knight
Jun 6 2015,positive,i looked at the cover thinking yea this looks terrible ill watch it anyways i thought wrong xd
Jun 6 2015,neutral,2 hours of nonstop action not always a good thing
Jun 6 2015,positive,definitely a movie worth seeing on the big screen
Jun 6 2015,positive,ok george miller 1000 points  every other action director under the age of 70 mr millers age 0 miller wipes the floor with snyder abrams whedon and all those pale poor shadows     nerds will love the return of the war boys  which helps makes sense if the duran duran song of the same name for those that remember and please correct me if im wrong the vw beetles from the cars that ate paris another great aussie flick    another nerd bonus point goes to miller for writing with brendan mccarthy genius comic book writer who gave the world the incredibly obscure paradax comics that kept me going through the creative drought that was the earlier noughties on rewind of course time to pour a little more petrol on those flames and lets kickstart a revolution
Jun 6 2015,positive,this movie is extraordinarily unique in my opinion delivers exactly what it promises everyone is insane and it is awesome to watch
Jun 6 2015,negative,i guess this rates five stars if you are a militant feminist  not even close to the original
Jun 6 2015,positive,this movie is really skillfully done in character development ethics and plot however im not sure why everybodys crapping themselves perhaps because they havent seen the original mad max movies its pretty consistent certainly nothing new it managed to not really thrill me particularly but it was definitely enjoyable tom hardy really owns his role charlize theron is a badass
Jun 6 2015,positive,thoroughly enjoyed amazingly well done
Jun 6 2015,positive,total nonstop action
Jun 6 2015,positive,the definition of crazed insanity
Jun 6 2015,neutral,seemed like a 2 hr action scene thats filmed in one location not sure why so many people liked this movie
Jun 6 2015,positive,a magnificent action film 
Jun 6 2015,positive,miller proves madness in heavy doses can be pure fun
Jun 6 2015,positive,wow what an intense ride a veritable visual orgy of vehicular based action set against a stark background of hideous looking inhabitants the exception to this is of course charlize theron who puts ubersex appeal into onearmed fierce warrior chick and tom hardy who doesnt say all that much but doesnt need to with his captivating screen appeal and killer lips mad in every possible way
Jun 6 2015,positive,crazily frenetic   all great theron
Jun 6 2015,positive,lived up to every expectation of the mad max series  dont miss it on the big screen
Jun 6 2015,positive,remember when the matrix shocked the audiences back in 1999   mad max fury road did the same to me after 16 years the story is not that complex but the action scenes oh mannnn the action scenesss
Jun 6 2015,positive,enjoyed the movie but do not think it was as good as the original story lines was pleased it did not try to be a remake of the first movie would be interested in seeing more movies set in this period
Jun 6 2015,negative,very poor character buyin  excessively loud and not very good music  3d special effects were the only saving grace
Jun 6 2015,positive,i came to this movie  with low expectations but this movie proved me wrong 
Jun 6 2015,positive,well worth the wait 
Jun 6 2015,neutral,if you like action and things blowing up this for you there isnt much else to this movie
Jun 6 2015,positive,mad max with his mad world   hell of a experience  
Jun 6 2015,positive,it kept me on my toes throughout the film from start to end
Jun 6 2015,negative,this is the worst movie it has been my misfortune to endure acting was so wooden that piboccio appeared to be a real boy in comparison storyline was notable absent as was any kind of logical follow on the one thing done well were the stunts and for that reason only i give 12 a star this movie is nothing more than a stealer of life
Jun 6 2015,negative,it was like a computer game with explosion after explosiononly you were watching someone else playing ityawn we walked out after an hour
Jun 6 2015,positive,seriously regret not being able to watch this movie in 4d
Jun 6 2015,negative,absolutely no plot barely any characterisation and its just a two hour long fighting car chase
Jun 6 2015,positive,the fact that action is my least favourite genre and i still gave this five stars is a testament to the quality of this film definitely a mustsee
Jun 6 2015,positive,an enthralling ride with points of calm between the heaves of storm mad max is a pretty intelligent action film as far as big blockbusters go its infused elements of the contemporary postapocalyptic genre which ironically takes its influence from the original films and the cult classic franchise itself despite the titular characters prevalence onscreen max rockatansky is played by tom hardy his relevance to the film is undermined not at all in a negative way by charlize therons performance as imperator furiosa who betrays the tyrannical patriarch immortan joe another commendable performance is nicholas hoults warboy nux who as a character provides a development to the film nux is another eventual traitor to the immortan joe kingdom as an actor he delivers a thoroughly convincing performance from the start this film is definitely worth a dvd buy when its out and a second or third watch in general 910
Jun 6 2015,positive,weak on plot but excellent on unrelenting action and production a more stoical and broodingly macho max is brought to the screen than mel gibson portrayed the improbably anorexic pregnant women aside it was an impressively rollicking film weak on substance but gripping and impressively put together
Jun 5 2015,neutral,want action well it is 2 hours of pure action from start to finish
Jun 5 2015,negative,sat there wondering wtf was i watching not as good as the first three mad max movies a bunch of special effects with no story
Jun 5 2015,positive,very intense  a long continuous chase trip great soundtrack and pretty good acting     seen with babette at amc mercado in july 15
Jun 5 2015,positive,the best action movie i have seen in years constant action the never lets up  amazing car designs stunts score and creativity  the fact its all real and not cgi even makes it better action and mad max fans this is the movie you been waiting for
Jun 5 2015,positive,great action sci fi compelling from start to finish miller teaches the young filmmakers how to make a cinematic feast schooled
Jun 5 2015,positive,mad max is what 5 hour energy says it will do it is a thrill ride for the ages and executes its point so perfectly that it is truly the best of the year for cinema
Jun 5 2015,positive,amazing nonstop 120 min of action   very dark makabre and cruel movie  love love loved it
Jun 5 2015,positive,a 70 year old man george miller shows every other action producer how to make a proper action movie if you are a producer take pen and paper and take lots of notes
Jun 5 2015,positive,this movie is awesome its so good its such a good movie never saw any of the other films but this one rocked the action is intense but cool to watch charlize theron is astonishing as the female lead and tom hardy is a perfect casting choice as max it takes a while to get into at first but eventually it captures you and has you at the edge of your seat ill admit its a bit disturbing with some weird creatures and bloody images but overall its incredibly well done one of my favorite films of the year my grade97a
Jun 5 2015,negative,horrible film   nothing more than a 2 hour car chase
Jun 5 2015,positive,a great return to awesome practical effects and riproaring action
Jun 5 2015,positive,really really good
Jun 5 2015,positive,it was actually a really movie 
Jun 5 2015,positive,amazing creative outrageous great move joe miller made a masterpiece cant wait till mad max wasteland
Jun 5 2015,positive,insane explosions and two and analog hours of driving psychopaths lolneed i say more
Jun 5 2015,positive,amazing action and beautiful filmmaking where it lacks in plot it makes up 200 in raw unhindered badassery basically exactly what you want from an action movie
Jun 5 2015,positive,i loved road warrior all those years ago  if possible this is even better  it even makes more sense that rw  you should see this film
Jun 5 2015,negative,what the hell is this  why put mad max on the title this is not a mad max film   total waste
Jun 5 2015,negative,a 2 hour race with no real plot
Jun 5 2015,positive,an apocalyptic story set in the furthest reaches of our planet in a stark desert landscape where humanity is broken and most everyone is crazed fighting for the necessities of life this movie is the story how lives the apocalyptic world and stay life from the world how it turns on him there is some easter eggs from all of the mad max movies in this film the soundtrack in this film is amazing plus the 3d was amazing i think if you like apocalyptic movies with action then you will enjoy this film i cant wait to see what they will come up with next for max in mad max the wasteland film
Jun 5 2015,neutral,he had the baine the voice whole time very little dialogue needed better plot
Jun 5 2015,negative,the only thing this movie has in common with the original mad max movie is that his name is max which is only divulged in the last 10 minutes of the movie and it was set in a wasteland it is just bizarre and quite frankly pointless i have no idea who voted it so highly on rotten tomatoes all the voters must have been teenage boys do yourself a favour and give this movie a miss because its just dreadful 
Jun 5 2015,positive,everything you could want from the apocalyptic action genre
Jun 5 2015,positive,must see nonstop action from start to finish 
Jun 5 2015,positive,absolutely fucking bonkers insane gross nonsensical but also utterly hilarious at times and 100 action totally justifies the title
Jun 5 2015,positive,action and mega stunts out the wazoo very cool flick charlize theron is great in her role
Jun 5 2015,positive,i enjoyed this film to a certain extent the thing i dont get is it had nothing to do with mad max at all to me it was more about furiosatheron didnt feel like max was in it enough to be mad max should have been renamed furiosa and the breeders if ther is to be a sequel i sure do hope itll be more focused on the title character than the supporting cast   thrilling action scenes and the chases are expertly done but max should have had more of a story like in the previous films

Jun 5 2015,positive,this movie will be shown in valhalla forever
Jun 5 2015,positive,non stop action but they still find a way to fit in a compelling story a must see
Jun 5 2015,positive,a visual masterpiece and entertaining from start to finish
Jun 5 2015,positive,george millers still got it pure action and weirdness that mad max should be tom hardy and charlize theron were great and surrounded by a great supporting cast of unknown so far this every movie i wanna see turns out great lets keep it rolling
Jun 5 2015,positive,i was totally impressed  i wasnt expecting it to be such a great movie  light on story heavy on visual storytelling  like maxs dialogue  i think he said about a dozen words in the whole movie

Jun 5 2015,positive,without a doubt one of the best movies i have seen in years  loved it and cant wait for the next one
Jun 5 2015,positive,stunning action setpieces and a beautiful attention to detail in its design also totally bonkers crazy fun
Jun 5 2015,positive,this is a 150 million dollar science fiction art movie watch it with that in mind but it is a ton of fun to watch amazing stunts awesome design work and a nice restrained use of cgi not that anything in this movie is restrained this nuked out australia has more life to it than in the past and it looks like a surrealists automotive nightmare max has always been a spectator to his own story in the fallout world set up in the road warrior he is the last identifiable link to our human world a guide we follow as he finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time this movie takes that idea to the extreme and max is just about the least important part of the movie thats ok because this new mad max world is no place for normal humans
Jun 5 2015,positive,not much left to say about this movie other than its amazing and you have to see it more than once you  will certainly catch stuff that you missed the first time around incredible movie simply incredible
Jun 5 2015,positive,exilirating you never saw such a temper before highly recommend only in cinemas
Jun 5 2015,positive,spoiler alert     i cannot get the image of the fat accountant man with the rings on his nipples out of my mind it is so disturbing why would you do that to yourself ughhh and seriously that pale postule filled moster of a ruler died the way he deserved
Jun 5 2015,positive,amazing performances from tom hardy and charlize theron
Jun 5 2015,positive,great action and follow on story in the same vein as the originals tom and charlize are terrific stunt teams are the hero and of the movie
Jun 5 2015,neutral,my personal opinion is that the movie is quite didnt worth the hype it got  others praising the movie is their personal interest
Jun 5 2015,positive,good fun movie to see
Jun 5 2015,positive,98 on rotten tomatoes  the film is so layered its ridiculous  great ride
Jun 5 2015,positive,i found quite depressing that san andreas sold something like 40m more than this movie luckily the tomatometer speaks for itself this movie will be or it already is a cult i guarantee it insert meme pic
Jun 5 2015,negative,a bunch of uninspired incoherent cyberpunk bullshit might as well have been called michael bays mad max
Jun 5 2015,positive,saw this last week and was completely blown away
Jun 5 2015,positive,lots of action but the plot wasnt very strong
Jun 5 2015,positive,one of the best action movies ive ever seen
Jun 5 2015,positive,while i dont think this film is the masterpiece its extremely high rating implies its definitely well done  the plot is simple its basically a 2 hour car chase and i guess i was expecting something a little more complex  however miller creates a vivid postapocalyptic setting with a constant intensity and i commend him for not relying a lot on cgi for the special effects the cast also does a great job at portraying the larger than life characters
Jun 5 2015,positive,fury road is an incredible story told by george miller that adds to his legacy and the legacy of the mad max franchise powerful story telling and amazing noncgi action sequences makes this one of the film of the year
Jun 4 2015,positive,mad max is back and better than ever and what a roller coaster ride of complete mayhem destruction and absolute insanity tom hardy was a great mad max and looking forward to seeing him in more the best part is there are also a few easter egg surprises that original fans may notice 
Jun 4 2015,negative,feminist propaganda charlize theron is not believable and cant carry the movie not enough story
Jun 4 2015,positive,absolutely thrilling to watch everything was amazing the action the soundtrack the story which is told perfectly for a non stop action film absolute cinematic action packed perfection
Jun 4 2015,positive,great acting great storyline and big cars highly recommend to anyone who loves actionadventure movies
Jun 4 2015,positive,mind blowing action sequences keeps your heart rate going out of the world visuals
Jun 4 2015,negative,mad max is an elaborate set with elaborate special effects and no story there is no character development whatsoever nor a plot worth following i left the film knowing none of the characters and caring even less what happened to them despite the time and expense on visualization there is nothing worth seeing
Jun 4 2015,positive,finally a movie with badass kick ass women ok i usually hate movies like this but i went begrudgingly and i got swept away i went from i hate this to ok im getting sucked in to edge of my seatheart in my throat exhilaration fueled by exciting anxiety i have never had a movie experience like this in still reeling hours later
Jun 4 2015,positive,minimalist writing and almost nonstop action make mad max an insane thrillride  this film has its own narrative language of sorts as miller and the other writers invent an entirely new world with its own set of crazy rules  the messaging is updated and has an incredibly progressive view with both a feminist and anticlassism slant that is muchappreciated  obviously the visuals are also stunning and theron owns every scene shes in  a really spectacular film allaround
Jun 4 2015,positive,very good movie if you are a person who loves action this is the movie for you
Jun 4 2015,positive,one of the best action movies of 2015
Jun 4 2015,positive,this movie was amazing it was action packed and surreal at some moments which is my kind of movie
Jun 4 2015,positive,by far the best action movie made so far
Jun 4 2015,negative,although a fan of the gritty original mad max  this movie had all the key elements of being great  but wasnt tom seemed emasculated and didnt showcase the intensity and strength of character of films past warriorlawless charlize character was unsympathetic despite her best efforts to balance between  being tough and being soulful  the carnage and revelry was constant and bothersome but did create the curiosity of when it would all end  hense the two stars
Jun 4 2015,positive,action packed george miller has not lost his magic touch one bit tom hardy is very good as mels quiet but heroic nutbag
Jun 4 2015,positive,a triumph of the goodlooking over the ugly and deformed
Jun 4 2015,positive,a visually stunning thrill ride that doesnt stop until the credits roll
Jun 4 2015,positive,cool but humorless nihilistic spectacle
Jun 4 2015,positive,brutal fuckedup and insanely fun
Jun 4 2015,positive,action packed from beggining to end love the characters and the setting the director portrayed in the movie cool cool cool
Jun 4 2015,positive,1st 20 minutes non stop action so much so whether the action stopped with a fade to gray screen you could hear and feel the entire audience sigh with anticipated relief that we finally got a much needed heart pumping action break   acting  âââââ  costumes  âââââ  special effects âââââ  cinematography  âââââ  score  âââââ  amazing amazing amazing  will see this again soon
Jun 4 2015,negative,i was so excited to see this and so crushingly disappointed in the result the story strained every shred of believability and connection with the characters maybe i am just exhausted by the prevalence of exceptionally prolonged fight or action scenes in movies today then add in that directors think so little of their audience that they either dont realize of dont care that people are taking physical abuse that would kill anyone and they just shake it off and keep fighting as if nothing happened add to this the frenetic pacing the pandering to young teens with the insertion of hot women the only five hot women on earth apparently who are all also vapid and a manic guitar shredder and i was out i still love charlize though and she was the best thing in the movie by far
Jun 4 2015,positive,great action never got bored of stuff getting blown up and broken  but not much else    casting must have been a nightmare
Jun 4 2015,positive,this was a wickedly excellent movie all the stunts are real no cgijust amazing 3
Jun 4 2015,positive,lots of high intensity action little in terms of a solid plot rather it has a reason  it resembles road warrior of the original 3 quite closely
Jun 4 2015,positive,mad max fury road    to quote joe bob briggs the worlds most famous drivein movie critic theres no plot to get in the way of the story    mad max fury road mmfr is set in a dystopian future where warlords rule and fight over oil and water in a desolate desert land outside any rule of law that would never happen     its the stupidest movie i have enjoyed in a long time the sets arent wonderful and the actingwhat acting the editing meh the cinematography is okay not spectacular for a dystopian road movie the make up nope not great     what works in the film is the action and morality tale and the vehicles the vehicles are cool ie fascinating im not a gearhead by any stretch but what they did to mix different vehicles together to make scary road war machines was very successful     like the horrendous there are no words to describe how bad mad max beyond thunder dome 1985 mmfr is a morality tale not about saving max but about saving the innocent however the writers were smart this time giving max few lines and making the female protagonist imperator furiosa the star     if there was an oscar category for best stunt work mmfr would win hands down its fun to watch while incredibly improbable however because it is set in its own world we accept that furthermore there are no posturing heroes spouting diatribes from patriotic speeches avengers or camp and cute but deadly sorts of heroes guardians of the galaxy or a vomit inducing good versus evil dualism that pervade so many super hero and other action films while violent and full of explosions it doesnt insult us with such morality play nonsense mmfr is pure action take it for leave it rating matineefull price    if action without pretense is your cup of tea if you are sick of the simplistic good versus evil plots if you like characters that dont easily fit into a box called villain or hero than you will enjoy mmfr if you need those things or you want more plot or thought i understand i would recommend you stay home and watch the also entertaining theory of everything  but youll miss some bad ass vehicles    peace   tex shelters
Jun 4 2015,positive,i have never been more entertained by a movie its is a thoroughly enjoyable action movie see it in a good theater
Jun 4 2015,positive,this was a really fun movie to watch
Jun 4 2015,positive,highest quality action film possible
Jun 4 2015,positive,imagine if a gifted psychopath on a gnarly mixture of coke and amphetamines decided to make a tribute to the original mad max and also added in a super violent fusion of scrapheap challenge and death race for good measure well its better than that probably
Jun 4 2015,positive,absolutely everything you want out of an action film
Jun 4 2015,positive,was gripping from the start and was entertaining throughout consistent suspense for around 70 percent of the film i would highly recommend beautifully filmed and the cgi was very well done seen the film in 3d and non both have the same impact and effect
Jun 4 2015,positive,very very strange movie not unlike its predecessors it takes a real sicko to come up with some of the stuff as seen in this movie the fact that most of the stunts are practical effects make this one you will probably want to see in the theater
Jun 4 2015,positive,if you watched and loved the road warrior mad mad and thunderdome you will certainly enjoy the new high action and cool effects version of mad max it can stand on its own for those that dont remember the original or never saw them but the setting and background will be a little confusing i would classify this as a guy flick
Jun 4 2015,positive,truly a great film the sound track makes this film
Jun 4 2015,positive,what a lovely day indead the scenarios the music the actions the acting the narrative this film is so wellcrafted george miller is truly a mastermind
Jun 4 2015,positive,this may be one of the most watchable most enjoyable action movies in the recent history if you dont mind some blood and tension that is the sets are jaw dropping the music carries you the entire time the characters are perfect so many memorable shots interactions its a perfect movie this will be the goto pump up movie for years to come excellent excellent excellent
Jun 4 2015,positive,nice visual great film the pacing and plot was well done and two hours went by in a flash the action scenes were good and not too over the top the cast did a great job the music was awesome and help set the rhythm for the film
Jun 4 2015,neutral,horrible  the action was okay the movie didnt make sense the bad guys was crazy  but the movie was horrible
Jun 4 2015,positive,awesome thrill ride and insanely over the top action movie opening 30 mins are about as pulse pounding and exciting as you will ever seen on film  in my top 5 action moves of all time for sure
Jun 4 2015,positive,george miller is the enemy of exposition he does not waste time telling the audience what they just saw he shows us with the most deft hand and skill imaginable since seeing road warrior when it first came out i knew this man was one of the best director visionaries alive and so far ahead of his time during rw my jaw hit the floor and i sat in my chair in stunned silence long after it ended the usher had to kick me out instead of driving home like a happy zombie i bought a 2nd ticket and went along for the same ride with equal enthusiasm awe and respect then king miller went on to change gears with babe and happy feet  talk about diversity and talent babe had more heart and emotion than any cheesy romance i had ever seen and deserved to be nominated for the academy award for best picture why people objected to that honor is beyond me     what followed after the less than stellar thunderdome cant win them all was 30 years of copycat action movies that could never match the standard that george miller set forth its almost as if gm came back to maxs world to tell them all  no no no thats not how you make an action movie have i taught you nothing with my work  then proceeded to show them once again how it should be done with fr im guessing that the bar has been raised so high into the clouds that every movie studio except warner is freaking out by the lesson mr miller just taught them all     fast forward to fury road a crowning epic that defies logic and words to describe this movie could have worked without any dialogue the minimal words spoken were precious gems treated with great respect without loud blaring organ music drowning it out im yelling at you interstellar there was plenty of dialogue and explanation with the visuals providing all that the viewer needed to follow this profound and relevant story sure there is lots of cg but it is woven in so organically that you dont even notice  the flow between live stunts and post enhancement is seamless and elegant this is unlike the avengers that makes me sick with claustrophobic cg and so many other movies that cant sell a story without blasting you with snazzy technology     ive seen fr 3 times and am writing my first review for a movie george miller should win every award in the book and i expect it to be nominated for every oscar category expect perhaps screenplay  bully to that if you spend the time following george millers brilliant career hearing his interviews and understanding the passion and fortitude it took to make this astounding movie then you would come to appreciate what happens when you authentically combine love and art     and lets not forget to thank warner bros for having the faith and pocketbook to finance this triumph they had as much trust in mr millers skill and vision as his loyal fans ive never seen the fast and furious movies and cant imagine how i would react to stunts that would seem like kids games compared to the masterful choreography in fury road and how is it that no one was killed or badly injured on the set that is testament to the great care that gm and his team put into all the preproduction storyboarding and precision execution the story of the making of fury road would be as inspiring and entertaining as the final product
Jun 4 2015,positive,the definitive art of making kick ass concept art a reality and doing it in style cant believe some people would insult this by watching screen copies go watch the 1080p or go home
Jun 4 2015,positive,somehow surpassed my already high expectations
Jun 4 2015,positive,this movie delivers on what long time mad max fans craved pure chaotic fun with bad ass cars gritty action and no punches pulled    this movie has and will continue to receive criticism for the simple plot but for this this movie is it works and any attempt to shoe horn in a deep complicated plot would get lost in the anarchy that spins your head around for the near whole duration on of the movie the use of practical effects and stunt actors is refreshing in a world where cgi is a hallmark of hollywood george miller invested an immense amount of detail into the mad max world presented in fury road that helps immerse you this world and makes the seemingly unbelievable post apocalyptic universe feel very tangible to the point you might try and shake the sand out of your shoes after leaving the theater    while this movie is a triumph in a landscape littered with remakes and cookie cutter films that seem tired and regurgitated this movie is not without its flaws the most glaring to me is the lack of moments where max really shined his dialogue was short with very little memorable lines which is a shame because tom hardy is extremely talented that being said this does not take a way from the movie as a whole it fits the story and works well its only after processing the movie as a whole you might step back and think there wasnt a lot of max in that mad max film    in closing this a sold film but its not something you are going to finish and feel emotionally moved you will leave the film feeling like you went on a roller coaster throw a wasteland its what a summer movie should be and what action movies arent anymore fun
Jun 4 2015,positive,without a doubt maybe the best action movie since raiders of the lost ark right out the gate it grabs you and until the last scene it wont let go what i liked about this movie is you dont have to be familiar with the mad max series to enjoy it hardy is perfect and so is theron there are some disturbing scenes regarding how they get some particular nutrients and ill leave it at that but one of the best pure action films ever
Jun 4 2015,negative,noise and blood lots of ugly setting and ugly looking people
Jun 4 2015,positive,this is probably the best action movie ive seen in the past 10 years       sure there have been many that have come out but when i actually dig deep into them and think about them more and what they were their significance goes down      this is as pure action film as it gets that starts from the beginning has minor breaks in the action to evolve the story a tad and continue moving full steam    its relentless and hits you hard with its thumping soundtrack that truly moves this film at a high pace       matt hardy is badass as max despite being secondary and having very few words in the flim although the film doesnt need too much talking as the action does all the talking    charlize theron without a doubt is the driving force in the movie and she is the main player here with max looking in she shows a very strong determination that cannot be broken you can see it in her face and actions she rocked this movie      this is a movie you can watch over and over whenever you need to wake up and forget about any of the past mad max movies and watch this as a new one try to leave the comparisons at home its not like a new guy took over the previous guys work here its still the same george miller putting together his finest work
Jun 4 2015,negative,all flash and no substance  even the titular character was completely one dimensional and in fact took a total back seat to furiosa and nux  no explanations for maxs flashbacks  no explanation for furiosas arm  nor for either of their supposed quests for redemption  the only actually interesting character was nux who actually went through a transformation over the course of the film  even the major plot twist was something i wound up anticipating from about halfway through the movie    i really dont get what has all the critics raving about this flick  it is absolutely mindless eye candy that throws away all substance in favor of goofy visuals  in other words its exactly what critics have been railing against for the last 20 years  the movie is a decent popcorn flick for killing a couple of hours  just dont expect to ever be actually interested in anything thats going on
Jun 4 2015,positive,arguably the best entry in the mad max franchise right up there with the road warrior a simple but well executed story fantastic and imaginative visuals and great pacing make this the perfect summer blockbuster
Jun 4 2015,positive,the action sequences are ridiculously good the best ive seen in a long time definitely has to be seeing on the big screen only negative is max barely speaks and his role is not that important in the story the movie is more about how bad ass charlize theron character is
Jun 4 2015,positive,excellent action movie with strong female characters
Jun 4 2015,positive,holds true to mad max mythos
Jun 4 2015,positive,a 70 year old man george miller took 180 million dollars as far out into the australian desert away from studio executives and nay sayers and made the most batshit insane eye popping film of the decade i was in a total sense of awe the entire 2 hours incredble
Jun 4 2015,positive,okay that was the best action movie ever nonstop and crazy beautiful and intense
Jun 4 2015,positive,i give this movie 100 out of 5 stars its incredible the movie is about this guy named max hes kinda of a cop well he used to be actually hes not a cop at all but hes kinda like steven segal that being hes kinda hard to kill so thats the premise of the movie max  the road  charlize theron minus an arm  x marked for death divided by under siege  above the law  fury road
Jun 4 2015,positive,incredible direction hard to believe its a 70 year old director making set pieces that are as good asbetter than the younger gen directors in hollywood  the film itself did lack a bit of substance for me though its pretty much a 2 hour car chase   it would be good to more of a story different setting
Jun 4 2015,positive,if there is such a term as halfmainstream midnight movie it will be best coined to mad max fury road from its narrative approach to various references and symbols the film oozes midnight cinema from every pore   having said this it is a surprise to me that it is so highly ratedboth on imdb and rt    as for the film itself it is a visual delight has enough action to keep viewers on their sit but it also has an unevenif a bit lazy opening act and a rather vague story   overall however the good outweighs the bad and makes fury road a worthy followup to the previous films
Jun 4 2015,positive,ay expected a lil more great chase scenes action got me excited for wasteland tho have more  lines hardy
Jun 3 2015,positive,a adrenaline blast almost too much to really see if a story exists amongst the destruction but as a fan of the original i must say it stands up as a great reboot
Jun 3 2015,positive,one of the most incredible visual films ive seen the stunts are a lot of fun yet for me none of the emotional stuff works at all
Jun 3 2015,positive,one of the best pieces of feminist literature i have ever chosen to expose myself too
Jun 3 2015,positive,action from start to finishif u liked the original mad max films you will enjoy this
Jun 3 2015,positive,have to give this excellent movie 5 stars but an empty popcorm bucket as there is no time to munch on popcorn in this action packed movie
Jun 3 2015,positive,a fantastic spectacle with the most innovative way of telling the story on the run that ive seen in years
Jun 3 2015,positive,best mad max movie made yet for many reasons
Jun 3 2015,positive,literally nonstop action
Jun 3 2015,positive,an adrenalinefueled nonstop thrill ride bizarre characters wicked stunts a mustsee on the big screen
Jun 3 2015,positive,best action film i have ever seenit was nonstop action from beginning to the end
Jun 3 2015,negative,i wont give it a 1 because the action scenes are out of control however repetitive
Jun 3 2015,positive,magnificent over the top a modern masterpiece its not just about the masterful direction and flamboyant visuals or charlize theron sublime acting its about the implicit theme violence to women so subtly explored and how these strong women rise and rebel and win
Jun 3 2015,positive,wow that was incredible
Jun 3 2015,positive,wow just a visual rollercoaster and a minimalist plot that manages to feel like more i cant wait for the bluray
Jun 3 2015,positive,a overall great movie not a lot of talking but great cinematography i really enjoyed it
Jun 3 2015,positive,great movie action is crazy  director did an amazing job better then the original
Jun 3 2015,positive,intense and not your normal action movie i liked its grittiness
Jun 3 2015,positive,i have no wordssimply awesome
Jun 3 2015,positive,tom hardy has been playin some great characters as of late and putting on great performances this one included
Jun 3 2015,positive,one of the best if not the best action movie ive ever seen
Jun 3 2015,positive,this might be my favourite movie shawshank redemption die hard and fury road this movie is absolutely brilliant
Jun 3 2015,positive,it was as if i was watching road warrior again miller has not lost the feel and nerve of his previous work if only we could say the same of spielberg lucas and scott the practical effects are amazing with the cgi adding just enough support the acting is solid and is delightfully over the top when needed
Jun 3 2015,positive,a must see action movie   fast paced action action action
Jun 3 2015,positive,with jawdroppingly beautiful fluid panoramic shots fury road is one of the most cinematically pleasing treats weve been gifted in a long long while this film is actionpacked but not at the cost of a fantastic storyline written with excellent flow appropriate pacing strong characters in every corner and at two hours long youll leave the theatre asking yourself when does the next film come out    millers outdone himself and i couldnt be more impressed mad max fury road is one of the few action films done right  no shaking cam no difficulttofollow sequences and every shot is desktopwallpaper quality    dont bother with the 3d for your first goaround the cinematic version of this film is worth watching asis and while the 3d is done very well and so tastefully that you dont actually notice it it is not immune to the typical readd issues of excessive jutter meaning if a character moves across the screen quickly the frames we see are choppy instead of fluid and it darkens the movie slightly not a lot but enough as the 3d effect does not serve as a critical element to the films delivery its sort of a if you see it twice sure see the 3d one the second time but it really doesnt add anything critical to the movie a film such as gravity is much more solid with the 3d since the effect submerges the viewer into that vast wideopen void of space in a way the cinematic version simply cannot do      so shiny and chrome see it on the bigscreen while you can because this movie is one hell of a highoctane ride and the scale of a theatre screen is only appropriate for experiencing the full scope and scale of its beautiful sweeping shots
Jun 3 2015,positive,beautifully shot engaging action and a surprisingly deep script that will take more than one viewing to pick apart
Jun 3 2015,neutral,what a load of old shit    full review coming tomorrow
Jun 3 2015,positive,very weird good storytelling but definitely not the masterpiece some critics are hailing it as
Jun 3 2015,positive,mad max fury road is one of the finest movies that ive ever seen in a theatre and this comes from a man who was not a fan of the originals nor a lover of the end of the world type of thriller in general you would have never convinced me that a 2 hour chase movie that drove the narrative pun intended would have enthralled me the way that it did and yet there was more than enough characterization especially from charlize theron to please even the most veteran movie critic tom hardy and the other actors are very good in their roles but theron deserves oscar consideration for work here
Jun 3 2015,positive,one of the top three movies i have ever seen
Jun 3 2015,positive,a mad symphony of action and image violent extreme beautiful and grotesque the world it depicts  makes little sense and what is worse is painfully conventional but it plays wonderfully
Jun 3 2015,positive,big giant aweinspiring stunts help propel fury road past other actionadventure films
Jun 3 2015,positive,great  almost as good as the first  very close  a tina turner cameo would have pushed it to a 5 star  i think she is still alive  real actors can bring an action film to life and they certainly did in this one  theron looked great even dirty with no hair no makeup and missing an arm and leg  this movie deserves an oscar nomination for something fx costume something
Jun 3 2015,positive,ehhh wasnt  bad but it wasnt great either
Jun 3 2015,positive,best film ive seen in years rip roaring adventure a must see
Jun 3 2015,positive,like watching art but not really a great movie persay sure it got rave reviews but it entirely lacked a coherent storyline i get it they want you to see the sequel but jesus explain something and develop some characters im sick and tired of franchises not explaining anything the first time around because they expect you to go see all their sequels ive seen all the 3 mad max original films and i was still like huh while watching a lot of this it was like a giant car chase the whole movie and just when you think its over they decide they will go back where they first chased and do it again i was starting to wonder if this was going to get boringredundant it wasnt in fact it was heart pounding and thrilling action throughout i think the director was almost showing off like let me reboot that last great action sequence to be even more intense and better i dont even like action that much but this was cool it stepped action up another level and i think a lot of films in the future will be borrowing from this movies ingenuity you can tell the director thought every visual detail through thoroughly from the costumes to hair to makeup to choreography to cool cars to special effects to cinematography it honored the original film by being better as far as visually and actionpacked  it def recreated the series severe postapocalyptic violent car gangs world it was sensory overload and i felt tired after watching this in a good way because i felt like they didnt have to go this extreme but instead they kept it over the top like the original series and threw in cheesiness in a good way many cool and unique scenes from the sandstorm to the crow graveyard place to the final chase thats why despite this film lacking some basic movie fundamentals i have to give it a high rating for the creativity and directing style alone
Jun 3 2015,positive,have a feeling i will have to watch this again before i can really appreciate it
Jun 3 2015,positive,this is a movie thats complete madness and it works so well i cant explain it the chase sequences are remarkable with interesting enough character depth to make this movie more than a chase through the wastelands charlize theron shines in her role the acting all around is impressive especially the cult followers theres no reason for the movie to be as good as it is getting reviewed by everyone but at the same time i just couldnt find anything bad about the movie i only was slightly disappointed in nicholas hoults characters major character change but otherwise what a tremendous movie
Jun 3 2015,positive,what a glorious film a great sequel very much in the vane of mad max 2 brilliant physical effects and wonderful cinematography
Jun 3 2015,positive,its like priscilla queen of the dessert but with actual women
Jun 3 2015,positive,amazing action packed film great big scenes with nice still cinematics there is very little dialog but its not needed
Jun 3 2015,positive,non stop action from start to finish
Jun 3 2015,positive,amazing cinematography was on the edge of my seat the entire time
Jun 3 2015,positive,best movie theater experience in years
Jun 3 2015,positive,one of the best action movie of all time
Jun 3 2015,positive,another lookingintothedismalfuture action gig with tons of dramatic sound effects and explosions and of course scantily clad good looking girls sit relax and numb your senses
Jun 3 2015,positive,action packed but the dialogue could fit on one page
Jun 3 2015,positive,awesome movie so much action that was a piece of artwork
Jun 3 2015,negative,whats good about it  well the visuals are great and the 3d is very well done    whats bad about it  oh boy    mad max 2 set the scene  it wasnt a complex plot but it worked well  mad max 3 added some more nice visuals a bit of a mess of a plot but still ok  then there was waterworld which took a lot of the visuals but with an even thinner plot and rightly got panned as a derivative piece of junk    this one  its waterworld minus whatever plot and character still survived  i wish i could think of something which would redeem it but really theres nothing  all thats left is to look at the pretty pictures and by halfway through youve seen whatever there is to see    george miller definitely has form on this  the original 300 was groundbreaking the sequel was tat  the original sin city was groundbreaking the sequel was tat  in this one i guess hes thought that since its a sequel then he can go straight to tat without passing good
Jun 3 2015,neutral,mostly i was confused as to why this movie is popular but it had a good message
Jun 3 2015,positive,too disney for an attempt at such a dark film
Jun 3 2015,positive,mad intermittently tedious first hour more like
Jun 3 2015,positive,ok i just saw this for the third time last night but this time in 3d in my opinion it changes everything i resisted seeing it in 3d because it doesnt seem like the type of film that would benefit from that treatment but i was very wrong sometimes the film has so much going on it it youre not sure where to look  sometimes it doesnt matter because anywhere you look something amazing is happening  but 3d focuses the action to the focal point of the frame it brings out details that might have been missed before    its like a room full of pinatas all exploding at the same time but you miss the big one filled with the best candy because you werent looking where you were supposed to be looking and consequently youre stuck with tootsie rolls and single starbursts from the cheapo family not in 3d you dont youre looking right where the director intended you to look at precisely the right moment boom    see it in 3d get the candy
Jun 3 2015,positive,maybe the best action movie i have ever seen ground breaking action and cinematography amazing blend between real stunts and cgi though the story is a little simple the action makes up for it it even has great character development especially furiosa and nux    this is a must see movie so watch when its still playing in theathers
Jun 3 2015,positive,well worth watching for any fan of the original mad max films or anyone looking for a good movie in the 21st century
Jun 3 2015,positive,nonstop exhilaration awesome
Jun 3 2015,negative,horrible possibly the worst movie i have ever seen
Jun 3 2015,positive,if you made the motorhead ace of spades album into a movie this would be it  one of the greatest action films ever made
Jun 3 2015,negative,this movie sucks 0 stars
Jun 3 2015,positive,this movie js by far one of my favorites does the previously made movies justuce its one of those movies you can see over and over and never get tored of watching it such great filmaking and an epic storyline along with the immaculate and immense action sequences that keep you asking for more
Jun 3 2015,positive,a nice world created and the action scenes are out of this world this keeps you hooked on till the end story wise nothing much but still worth a watch
Jun 3 2015,positive,best action film iv seen at the cinema in years
Jun 3 2015,positive,great movie keeps you enthralled the whole way great to see strong female characters
Jun 3 2015,positive,kept me on the edge of my seat
Jun 3 2015,positive,it has been nearly 2 weeks since i saw fury road and im still trying to recover it is the sort of film you forget to breathe through much like interstellar but for an altogether different reason unrelenting from beginning to end this postapocalyptic saga is virtually one long explosive chase sequence albeit one which seemingly has new ideas on tap the action ie the whole film is utterly bonkers conceptually and in execution that writerdirector george miller and his team concocted such ferocious set pieces is impressive enough but being able to pull it off with extraordinarily daring stunt work  augmented by gritty cgi  is simply aweinspiring  visually it is vivid and spectacular the searing desert landscape offering a dirtfilled grime so tangible your throat will dry up within seconds whilst the vehicles are creative and wonderfully preposterous the heartpounding score by junkie xl in which he blends orchestral and heavy metal music accompanies millers on screen splendour to create a visceral experience for both the eyes and the ears the vehicular carnage may be the drawcard but the committed cast elevate the overall product tom hardy is savage as max charlize theron is compelling as imperator furiosa and nicholas hoult remember xmen is gonzo as nux whilst a plethora of recognisable aussies show up in deranged cameos  theres an intensity here you just dont find in majority of the bigbudgeted blockbusters an inventiveness in all elements that drives this movie from great to mesmerizing miller hasnt played in the mad max world since the dreadful beyond thunderdome back in 1985 but by god he has redeemed himself and then some fury road is a rollicking ride that carves out a piece of cinematic history all for itself  considering the wave of terrible 90s scifi sequelsremakes weve had fired our way in the past few years terminator salvation robocop total recall etc fury roads success has been more than a pleasant surprise  in short it is a grungy masterpiece
Jun 3 2015,positive,a wildly intoxicating ride that never fails to thrill with its hyper reactive sense of style and flair fury road not only rejuvenates the mad max series it also rejuvenates the action film series a well needed shot of adrenaline
Jun 3 2015,positive,charlize theron isnt not hot
Jun 3 2015,positive,dont bother with jurassic world or entourage or san andreas or pitch perfect 2  just go see this
Jun 3 2015,negative,i feel very alone but this was a terrible movie almost no plot almost no dialogue and no character development i had to force myself to stay in my seat and not leave the theater
Jun 2 2015,positive,awesome movie the best action movie i have seen in a long time
Jun 2 2015,negative,pointless plotless ridiculous 2 hours car chase scene
Jun 2 2015,positive,explosion scream smoke sand exciting fun
Jun 2 2015,positive,i thought i didnt really like it when i saw it on saturday but ive been thinking a lot about it ever sense so i think it will be one of those movies i like more the 2nd time there were parts i hated but there were things i really liked too
Jun 2 2015,positive,take a heavy metal concert and mix it with probably one of the best action films of all time this was easily the most exciting and ferocious mad max film to date there is a small story amongst this high octane tale and since the first installment this one actually made sense among all the sequels which were a bit harder to follow even if we dont know the whole backstory of how this world came to be in this apocalyptic setting here we have these characters all fighting for survival and more importantly here women fighting to get their independence back in a chaotic world ruled by a psychopath my only complaint really here is that the acting and script here are a bit dry but that doesnt take away from this amazing picture that is really unlike anything ive ever seen charlize theron is also pretty much boss here taking over what seems to be the lead role in this picture and kicks some major ass here tom hardy was a  decent max even though his acting was a bit off here also nicholas hoult was fantastic as the albino looking character in this and is quite memorable this is easily the craziest action ride you are likely to go on this whole year and the academy awards owes this film as much technical awards as it can get along with its heavy hitting soundtrack easily one of the best films of the year and officially in my top action films of all time
Jun 2 2015,positive,possibly my favorite movie twisted stunning artistic and totally glorious well worth seeing in the theater if you can make it
Jun 2 2015,negative,i thought they ought to be more careful with their water and petrol cmon proletariat put your bucket into the actual waterfall instead of trying to catch the rain and charlize go easy on that war rig heres a question if it didnt look incredible would this movie be any better than a fastfurious dealy not really sure theres something to be said for millers unapologetic focus on aesthetics but it doesnt hold up as the masterpiece many are claiming hollow acting clicheridden dialogue and little real suspense
Jun 2 2015,positive,big movie made for the big screen
Jun 2 2015,positive,very intense    i dont know if i want to watch the second one or not
Jun 2 2015,negative,seriously dont see this film  the two main characters managed to look cool but that was about it  there was no dialogue or story line  it was one crazy long car chase and a lot of over the top acting the special effects and stunts are obviously the only thing viewers seem to care about these days
Jun 2 2015,positive,went in not knowing what to expect and i really got a lot more than i bargained for really powerful visual film with an intense underlying message very fast paced highly actionpacked and incredibly hardcore very interesting film
Jun 2 2015,negative,half a star for at least showing some females in nonvictim roles but in general all characters are unsympathetic the action is unbelievable in the most negative sense of the word and the plot doesnt hang together awful movie
Jun 2 2015,negative,this movie was a total waste of time loud boring no character development and no plot the dialogue could not be heard a lot of the time due to the loud background noise my wife came with me to this movie based on the high ratings unfortunately it is so bad that im going to have to see a chick flick with her to pay her back for her indulgence
Jun 2 2015,positive,one of my new favorite movies
Jun 2 2015,negative,i so wanted this to be good  unfortunately the wall street boyz laid another dud  not sure what everyone is smokin but this movie was flat out boring  marketing 101  lets target the 1214 yo boys demographic and make a contrived movie about chaos and mayhem and btw  and dont worry about any of it making sense or going anywhere  wait for it on netflix and dont say you werent warned
Jun 2 2015,positive,that guitarist though 
Jun 2 2015,positive,action movie masterclass
Jun 2 2015,positive,fury road isnt just balls to the wall it crushes the wall in a big rig covered in harpoon guns and flame throwers because fuck walls
Jun 2 2015,positive,78  insanity i didnt know you could make a 2hr car chase movie      acting8  effects10  story7  twistshock6  tone10  pacing9  action9  dialogue6  design10    rewatch7  in theaters5  sequelcomplete7
Jun 2 2015,positive,holy mother of all apocalyptic progressive action movies the hype is real i cant begin to scratch the surface of how great mad max is so all im going to say is this flamethrowing guitar
Jun 2 2015,positive,awesome endtoend beauty full of car chases chaos and a female heroine  tom hardys max is more feral dog than mel gibson  making the protagonist that more interesting  worth every penny
Jun 2 2015,positive,loved it  while most of the movies i have seen in 2015 have been late 14 releases to say this is my fave film of 15 isnt saying a lot because i have not seen a llot of 15 films that said i absolutely loved and have no doubt it will finish in my top 10 of not 5 of 15 and is the best ive seen this year thus far tom hardy is great but it is charlize who steals the movie which is furiously and expertly directed by george miller
Jun 2 2015,positive,most fun ive had at the theater this year it gives you minutes to recover between stunning action sequences decorated with elaborately created land terrorizers driven by some of the coolest villains and heroes max is played by the always solid tom hardy but charlize theron is the star of this film her furiosa is as tough as they come and her rig is beyond awesome see it on the big screen im already looking to grab folks who havent seen it or those who have so i can take another ride in the wasteland
Jun 2 2015,positive,meet a new era in chick flicks i loved it but judging from all of my lady friends it said something to them akin to freddy mercury singing  we will rock you does for me at the gym visceral but not all that bloody relative to films i have seen bring any action girl you know to enjoy a beautiful post apocalypse
Jun 2 2015,positive,this movie was really really good i was iffy about seeing it because i thought it looked weird which it was but in a good waythis is well acted and directed and the story line is exciting all the way through the movie from the very beginning
Jun 2 2015,positive,not sure its possible to have made a more metal movie  fricken awesome
Jun 2 2015,positive,the trailer was much better
Jun 2 2015,positive,wow just wow absolutely astounding filmography and storyline thats worth watching again and again
Jun 2 2015,positive,after viewing the trailers for fury road i was not convinced this movie would be very great all the scenes had the same desert backgound i thought the film might be drab however when i noticed the director was george miller i started to believe the film was 2 hours in length but it didnt seem like it probably because of its relentless action throughout borrowed from the road warrior the film featured a big rig racing across the desert to retrieve gas while being chased by psycho bad guys when comparing it to the originals fury road did not dissapoint in fact this movie was just an updated hybrid version of the originals just like everyone would want george miller again put his signature on the film with lots of attention to detail similar to what made the first installments so unique fury road is one remake that did not dissapoint
Jun 2 2015,positive,its a 4 because its damn funny and entertaining hahahah
Jun 2 2015,positive,its a constant 100 full bore action movie that almost never stops  plus it has a pretty good story  i see sequels in this future
Jun 2 2015,positive,so i watched meshuggahs new extended video erm i meant mad max it was awesome
Jun 2 2015,positive,wow mad max fury road is one of the best action movies of all time this film was on my most anticipated list for 2015 and i was not disappointed the film keeps you engaged from the very opening scene and you really get transported into the world george miller did a wonderful job of bringing his vision to life and this movie was visually breathtaking the action was filmed great i never got bored in a two movie about a car chase no skakey cam whatsoever great job i also love the performance of tom hardy as max and charlize theron was absolutely perfect this was her movie and she could have carried it herself last but not least there was no over reliance on cgi mostly practical effects which made this insane film believable this movie is nuts and absurdly entertaining please go see mad max fury road
Jun 2 2015,positive,insanely good  i need to lie down knackered
Jun 2 2015,positive,very exciting mindless fun very over the top lots of action loved charlize but thats standard she is always the best part of anything shes in great looking and phenomenal special effects however its not a movie that will make me think
Jun 2 2015,positive,genuinely relentless throughout and never dull i couldnt believe it was half an hour and felt blasted after
Jun 2 2015,positive,so awesome  and oh so badass charlizes furiosa is biggest badass in the movie
Jun 2 2015,negative,to crazy for me  not even close to the original
Jun 2 2015,positive,one of the best action movies
Jun 2 2015,positive,this isnt a film that will be to everyones taste  it has a unique style and you need to place your brain firmly in action mode because its almost non stop  the film is essentially one long chase movie loud intense and a little bit nuts    if anything is missing then its a decent back story we get brief loud flashbacks that hint at tragedy but i found it a little frustrating that this wasnt explored further  if this is a direct sequel to the original mel gibson trilogy then i guess there is no need for further explanation but if its a remake then i think they should have covered maxs origins a little better  im actually still non the wiser whether this is a sequel or a remake  tom hardy was a decent lead but i thought the supporting cast were the ones that really stood out charlize theron and nicholous hoult  worth seeing if youre a fan of the original and are familiar with george millers vision  if not then you may think its a little ott
Jun 2 2015,neutral,pointless really here is the entire plot escape go back run credits if special effects action and goofy characters are enough for you you will love this if you want something more stay home
Jun 2 2015,positive,a excellent reboot of a classic franchise
Jun 2 2015,positive,adrenaline filled practical action packed movie with charlize theron at her finest
Jun 2 2015,positive,not a ton of dialog but what are you looking for with an action flick  this movie is is edge of your seat action from start to finish
Jun 2 2015,positive,stop whatever your doing in fact dont read this go watch mad max fury road movies like these make me say im done with terrible action films like the transformers sequels mad max is something everyone needs to see if you claim to love cinema this is similar to guardians of the galaxy something oldschool yet new and opens up potential for the future i love this film go see it
Jun 2 2015,positive,non stop action presented in non cheesy way thanks
Jun 2 2015,positive,very good action movie but just action movie
Jun 2 2015,positive,amazing atmosphere crazy originality and creativity not for everyone people who like robert rodriguez movies will love this
Jun 2 2015,negative,i wanted to like it but it just felt like it was incomplete and the story left something to be desired
Jun 2 2015,neutral,writerdirector george miller returns to the world of mad max with the reboot mad max fury road  set in an apocalyptic wasteland a rogue warrior named max gets caughtup in a battle between a tyrannical warlord and an escaping group of concubines  tom hardy is no mel gibson and doesnt really bring any charisma to the role  in fact none of the performances are anything more than serviceable  but the action sequences are incredibly dynamic and exciting  the visual aesthetic is also quite remarkable with extremely creative vehicle and costume designs  though neither the story nor the characters are that interesting mad max fury road delivers some extraordinary chases and fight scenes that are wildly entertaining
Jun 2 2015,positive,this is what action movies should be like
Jun 2 2015,positive,beautiful exciting and adventurous mad max fury road was a perfect blend of artistic plot and meaning and minddumbing fun that can and should be appreciated by everyone this film was damn near perfect
Jun 2 2015,negative,a lot of action didnt follow the plot at all hardy looked good but all in all eh
Jun 2 2015,positive,very sold action flick the cinematography is pretty powerful as is the performance of charlize theron the title of this film really ought to be mad charlize my main complaint about this film however is there is virtually zero character development for example tom hardys character  barely spoke more than 5 sentences the whole film but other than that if your looking for a good action flick that simply kicks ass than look for further
Jun 2 2015,positive,amazing movie nice to have an action movie with a bit of substantial plot its definitely not neccecary to see the first movies in fact i wouldnt reccomend those unless you are into vintage movies
Jun 2 2015,positive,a high octane adrenaline filled exhilarating ride of a movie which you cant help but enjoy
Jun 2 2015,negative,a 2 hour car chase with next to no dialogue and ungripping action makes this movie worth nobodys time an awful movie
Jun 2 2015,positive,it takes a really really great movie for me to give five stars mad max is that great the stunts are amazing because they are real the trucks are real the explosions are real the cast is awesome movie has very little cgi affects so get up and see this movie now in 3d before it leaves the theaters
Jun 2 2015,negative,i cant understand why anyone i mean anyone ever likes any of these films  the half star is simply for the moments i laughed  that is all
Jun 2 2015,positive,when i saw the movie i was happy george miller return to his world and was able to do much more now he knows how to make a good action movie and great movie in general
Jun 2 2015,negative,i couldnt even eat with this movie hate it
Jun 2 2015,positive,the same theme as the original but a new story  very well done  o
Jun 2 2015,positive,best mad max hands down
Jun 2 2015,positive,not as bad as i expected it to be but certainly not that original good entertainment nevertheless some of the editing was annoying  so many cuts that you cant see clearly what is happening that editing style seems so common these days in actions movies
Jun 2 2015,positive,pretty good a bit cheesy but in a reminiscent way to its predecessor great action very enjoyable
Jun 2 2015,positive,definitely sets out what it trys to accomplish its action packed with seldom a moment to pause there were a few moments where those pauses were a little awkward i didnt find the narrative especially amazing but it was able to hold itself and the action together it was definitely a spectacle to see and worth watching in the theater but once again im not sure i agree with a 98 rating i give this a positive review and 98 of the critics did as well but its definitely not the best movie ive seen in a while still good though
Jun 2 2015,positive,exhilarating tons of fun and batshit crazy mad mad fury road is pure action gold with exceptional camerawork practical effects and very limited use of cgi
Jun 2 2015,positive,mindblowingly awesome i wanted to go straight back in and watch it again hands down my movie of the year maybe even the decade
Jun 1 2015,negative,disappointing from start to finish  this is not a mad max movie its a charlize theron movie  if it were called fury road with no mention of max and tom hardy were removed from the film entirely it would be a decent action flick  what has happened is that the mad max character and franchise have been hijacked in order to sell tickets  the dialogue is barely audible drowned out by engine noise and background music and exactly one line about 20 minutes in got a subtitle  the whole thing needs subtitles  in the real mad max movies you know youre watching a movie about mad max  in this one hes an afterthought in front of the camera much of the time but not even close to being central to the story  was there a time when tom hardy took over made a decision became a leader did something heroic  if so i must have been so bored by the time it happened that i missed it  and what was up with that absurd russ meyerstyle nakedgirlsinthedesert interlude    note to george miller  if you insist on putting mad max in the title it might be a good idea to give max a significant role in the film    signed a lifelong fan of the real mad max films which are actually about max
Jun 1 2015,positive,superb acting and intense action sequences but the style of the movie is what struck me the most film of the year so far
Jun 1 2015,positive,makes fast and furious look like hot wheels
Jun 1 2015,positive,lots of dust screaming hideous dune buggies in pursuit of or being pursued by perverse postapocalyptic goons a onearmed heroine and a grunting antihero mad max awesome as ever humors pretty dry too
Jun 1 2015,positive,great actiongreat visuals
Jun 1 2015,negative,i wish there is a no star view
Jun 1 2015,positive,no story just pure action
Jun 1 2015,positive,action packed movie from start to finish
Jun 1 2015,positive,one of the best action films of 2015 it was refreshing to see something that kicked ass for once on the big screen loved every minute of it
Jun 1 2015,positive,3d is not necessary  to enjoy the actionpacked film with fantastic special effects
Jun 1 2015,positive,all brutal action with almost no romantic subplot yes please
Jun 1 2015,positive,finallyeverything mad max should have been in the first 3 attempts cant wait for more
Jun 1 2015,positive,a whiteknuckle nononsense actionfest for grownups the inertia of this one is tangible in a way not experienced since terminator 2 the chase intensity is slowly amped up to 11 in a way you wouldnt think possible going in and the performance if not the look of charlie theron already seems almost iconic its not just the best action flick youll see in 2015 its probably the best one youve seen in the last 1520 years
Jun 1 2015,positive,lets get it out of the way first up ive never seen any of the previous mad max movies i have minimal knowledge of the universe and went to this one because my partner is a fan and i was blown away  fantastic action sequences that really stood out from other movies brilliant performances from tom hardy charlize theron and nicholas hoult and an engaging story theres real depth to this movie and to so capture me without the requirement of being an established fan is impressive tom hardy has had one or two fitting roles prior but now settles wholly into one that fits him exceptionally well managing a hell of a lot with little dialogue furiosa in wrong hands would have remained an immemorable character worthy of suspicion and confusion but theron strikes the perfect note seeming to know exactly what to give away at any given point in time the scene of her bionic arm left in the dust falling to her knees in the sand is one of the films most poignant the showstealer was nichaloas hoult who embraces yet another quirky character and completely nails it as a war boy sickly and fanatic nux has been raised to worship the cult leader immortan joe as a god but after witnessing him complete an act of cruelty against one of his own wives he has a change of heart and winds up joining max and furiosa in their frantic escape learning oe of two things about how to live a decent life in the process   i wont lie  there were parts of the story that were obvious before they happened nuxs fate maxs universaldonor blood blood saving the day and the moment he speaks his name  but these are not such negative thins sometimes seeing what we expect isnt a disappointment its fulfillment so it was with fury road anyway
Jun 1 2015,positive,the best in the mad max series full review here 
Jun 1 2015,positive,this film was pretty freakin great not only is it the best action film ive seen in a while it had a surprising amount of narrative depth
Jun 1 2015,positive,very weird movie but some elements are intriguing the villain is very cool but the directing feels over the top max is so deadpan and quiet he really isnt the star of the film furiosa is having never seen the other max films im sure i lack the appreciation for this series but this film seems to be a well done continuance of the genre if youre into that sort of thing i personally got bored with the constant action sequences which all take place while speeding through the desert even a hundred cars exploding and rolling gets boring after a while
Jun 1 2015,negative,very depressing movie  too much blood and torture
Jun 1 2015,positive,mad max fury road is the best thing to fucking happen to movies in like fucking years  okay  now that i have your attention      i actually hesitated to review this for several reasons  the primary reason is because i feel that i am completely unequal to the task of writing a critique of a film that is so far beyond me on every conceivable level that i have no clue how to proceed or give it justice without sounding trite pandering or somehow further expose myself as a hack amateur geny fanboy critic bereft of original commentary  but even if that is true i still have the obligation nay the directive to inform moviegoers that this is something to behold and recognize as one of the greatest movies of the past decade  and that is not a hyperbolic statement  that is codified law      what makes this film truly exceptional is wellfucking everything  fury road is an operatic masterpiece and by far the best entry in a series that had been dormant for decades  it bears much in common with the road warrior but it exceeds even that the cinematography is perfect  production design and art direction are outrageously flawless  the color palette is saturated with hues and contrasting tones that narrate the story and make it memorable  every image and shot could be framed as a beautiful and alluring oiloncanvas painting and hung in a modern art museum  the performances and casting are without misstep  charlize theron gives a performance for the ages as the films true protagonist and dominates every moment we are blessed with her viciously powerful and yet subtly fragile imperator furiosa  tom hardy fills the shoes of our titular hero quite well playing a less roguish and charming max than gibson but more unhinged and defensive  bringing him in line with this films erratic and hypercharged tone  credit must be given to nicholas hoult as a wouldbe sacrificial stormtrooper who comes to realize the evil warlord he worships may not care about his efforts as much as he would care to admit  and speaking of that warlord who knew bringing back the actor who played the main villain from the first film hugh keaysbyrne would pay off so well in the form of immortan joe a deformed albino cross between tom hardys bane hey what and darth vader  even the super minor roles floored me and i feel guilt ridden for not elaborating on those        id also be remiss to not dwell on the films decidedly femalecentric tone and plot  what i mean by that should come off as obvious  the main character is a female warrior whose primary goal is to save a group of sex slaves from immortan joe and bring them to safety in the form of a small tribe run by women far from the reach of maledominated patriarchy  thats about as on the nose as you can get  in fact there are two distinct paths which the female slaves and hoults exstormtrooper are given  they can stay in a patriarchal borderline fascist state run by joe that brainwashes its people and warrior class through rehashed norse mythology and the illusion of safety  or they can follow furiosa toward a matriarchal one based in what i assume is some kind of meritocracy and one defended by elderly amazonian women with dirt bikes and big fucking guns  then theres max who chooses neither but chooses to aid the side with the most merit as he represents the wandering gunman trope from the classic western genre mad max derives much of its imagery and soul from  a lawman who finds himself in an era in which law has no meaning or place    feminism and philosophical leanings aside this film delivers on action in the same way henry hill delivered on cocaine in goodfellas  you almost certainly have heard that this movie is one gigantic chase scene but whats more important is that it was accomplished mostly by old school practical effects stuntwork and moving rigs  fury road somehow accomplishes the impossible task of being both outrageously overthetop while being fairly dark and gritty  every scene has consequence and every moment is entertaining  the mad max films were incredibly influential to postapocalyptic fiction and had dramatic impact on many of the things we enjoy to this day including the fallout series which i love  to see this come back and blow the doors off the modern film industry is truly something to behold  george miller just came back and told contemporary action directors that theyre doing it wrong  and it would behoove them to listen       ps  to all the critics who keep labeling tom hardy a flavorofthemonth actor  fuck you  he is one of the most capable character actors in the business today  eat shit and die
Jun 1 2015,positive,full of action not as bloody as former sequels
Jun 1 2015,positive,in meeting what it sets out to achieve this film is outstanding forget all the talk about feminist messages  thats way overthinking it its a chase film and a really really good one at that the only weak points are the couple of times where the action slows down so we the audience can catch our breath in those moments where the characters actually need to talk the dialogue is fairly inane but before long it winds up again and off we go see it on the biggest screen you can find
Jun 1 2015,positive,one of the few movies to have both amazing storytelling as well as action scenes
Jun 1 2015,positive,one of the best action movies ive ever seen
Jun 1 2015,positive,an exhilirating piece of cinema gorgeousness which does more than a standard action flick and does it with style thanks to great direction
Jun 1 2015,negative,mel gibsons movies were much better than this version after an hour i wanted to get out of the theater mindless movie with explosions every ten seconds
Jun 1 2015,positive,sure personal biases help me relate more to main character but still a great flick empowering to women empowering to good  stayed close to original great storya little comicish but still great  some scenes were superamazingwell done loved it    saw it twice in digital  once in 3dworth every penny
Jun 1 2015,positive,very good movie all the way around cant wait for the next one
Jun 1 2015,positive,if you have not seen this movie there is something wrong with you im kiddingjust a little bit you have to keep in mind i believe this movie has any cgi all the action scenes which is literally from frame 1 until the end were made without cgi the imagery and themes that are portrayed in this film is what makes it enjoyable to watch for the two hours sitting there i wasnt bore for a second     if you enjoy explosions people kicking a and much more then go see thisnow
Jun 1 2015,positive,this movie is insane and thats a compliment its one of the greatest movies ive ever seen and ive seen a lot exceeded my expectations how they even made it is beyond me go see it
Jun 1 2015,positive,absolutely brilliant
Jun 1 2015,positive,best movie of the year so far
Jun 1 2015,positive,absolutely awesome tom hardy nails the mad side of maxs personality which i always thought mel gibson didnt it threw in what i thought were elements from beyond thunderdome   some of the stunts during the chase scenes were original and exciting the part in the swamps was i thought kinda spooky something different for mad max but it worked it had a nice plot that didnt go as planned for the characters but they made it work   all in all an awesome flick go see it
Jun 1 2015,negative,so overrated it boggles the mind though it is full of fantastic effects and stunts it is both banal and utterly preposterous that the critics give it 98 good reviews does indicate that we are hellbent on dumbing ourselves into oblivion one we deserve man and woman alike
Jun 1 2015,negative,this was like a big budget summer action movie with what little is left of plot dialogue and character development left in such films these days cut out so just the special effects and explosions are left over an endless chase scene with admittedly cool cars pieced together from some postapocalyptical junk yards that just went on and on with very low stakes
Jun 1 2015,neutral,i cant believe people and critics are rating this movie so high is the world full of sheep or very simple people very average movie no plot n stunts ive seen thousands of times before entertaining but didnt grab me as enthralling
Jun 1 2015,positive,great but my ears are still ringing
Jun 1 2015,positive,recently i wrote that i fell asleep at the latest avengers movie a film with lots of action  why  because it was the typical stuff ive seen before and come to expect from a movie like that having seen the first one  but never did i come close to falling asleep or daydreaming or even thinking about anything other than the movie at hand when watching mad max fury road  if you start to doze off while watching this you should probably seek professional help  you dont need to have watched the old mad max films to follow this one  in fact i only saw one of the three back in the day  this movie stands on its own  its basically a 2hour car chase  normally i dont care for car chase sequences too much because its another thing thats been done over and over  but youve never seen a car chase like this  and the story is easy to follow  one guy named immortal joe runs the land  whats left of the land anyway  he has female slaves and is basically starving most of the people giving them just enough water to live  max played by tom hardy and sporting another face mask just like when he played bane in the dark knight rises is a survivor who is captured by immortal joes men at the beginning of the film  charlize theron plays furiosa a woman who decides to take the slaves away from the leader and off to a better place she remembers from her past  joe sends all his men including himself on the road to capture her  max the survivor that he is manages to break away and ends up on the run with furiosa and the women  its a pretty simple story and its all explained in the first 20 minutes or so  from there on its vehicles with crazy contraptions going full speed ahead with just about any weapon you can imagine  chainsaws flamethrowing spears machine guns cars with deadly spikes all over them even an electric guitar that shoots fire when played  this couldve came off very cheesy but the whole thing is shot in amazing fashion  the stunts are incredible and the action never lets up  of course there are a few scenes where things have to come to a brief halt to actually have some dialogue among the characters  but theres always that feeling that the bad guys are not far behind and the action will kick right back into full gear  and though the movie doesnt require a lot of soulsearching type acting it does help to cast good actors like tom hardy and charlize theron who make it all so intense and believable  they pull off all of their fight scenes as well  you can count on this movie to be up for multiple awards come oscar time because its so expertly crafted  the cinematography makeup sound and visual effects are all just about as perfect as you can want in a movie filled with so much ambitious energy  simply put the movie is bonkers  this is what one hopes for in a big summer blockbuster  dont worry about seeing it if youre a little tired it will wake you up
Jun 1 2015,positive,this is why there are movies
Jun 1 2015,positive,this movie was amazing i thought it would be hard to top off mad max with mel gibson and tina turner so i was reluctant to see it turns out it was out of this world
Jun 1 2015,positive,best action movie in the last times
Jun 1 2015,positive,it must be really depressing to be the five critics in the whole world who called this rotten i havent been this blown away by an action movie in ages everything from direction to art direction blends together in an explosion of sheer insanity that might be impossible to beat i need to see this film in slomo so i can pay attention to the details warning will cause motion sickness in some people
Jun 1 2015,positive,best movie ive ever seen best action scenes ive ever seen and best cinematography ive ever seen
Jun 1 2015,positive,i really liked furiosa the wives the vuvalini they were fucking awesome the rest the worldthe drivers the whole thing was totally fucked up
Jun 1 2015,positive,visually stunning great worldbuilding treats the audience as intelligent  lots of amazing female performances a great movie that offers a new perspective lacking from most action films these days
Jun 1 2015,positive,great action great characters good story little dialog perfect
Jun 1 2015,positive,stunning max  who in the beginning deny it   is a paladin that gravitates around the other characters helping then and showing witch path they need to follow    every character was very well constructed with they own reasons and desires and i say special congrats to nux  who was nothing more than a cannon fodder  and became one of the true heroes in this movie fighting for family and purpose
Jun 1 2015,positive,havent seen a movie this exciting and captivating in a loooonng time   first time i would say that the 16 dollar 3d ticket is worth every penny     after the movie i was like hot damn
Jun 1 2015,positive,the world itself is enough to drag you in excellent film bring imax movies not 3d
Jun 1 2015,positive,agree with critics on the exhilarating action but still looking for the surprising narrative heft  seems as if miller was enamored with 1970s rock with a leader who easily could be called aqualung and his minions looking like bowies thin white dukes and with his kiss drums and guitar of war   theron steals the show with her tank girl persona  hardy didnt say much and couldnt understand him anyway  53115
Jun 1 2015,positive,great actions packed film of futuristic survival mad max well not sure why it was called a mad max film when it was more about the woman he was with
Jun 1 2015,positive,when i saw your score of 98 to this movie i hadnt yet seen it and so i was skeptical now that i saw the movie im not skeptical anymore now i genuinely feel like youre on drugs
Jun 1 2015,positive,fantastically non stop they keep it 100 the entire movie visually beautiful with a surprising amount of emotion so damn cool
Jun 1 2015,positive,between the action and characters  reminds me of borderlands in a lot of ways  top 5 action movies easily
Jun 1 2015,positive,totally fresh genre fast moving from start to finish those who have not seen previous films will be able to jump right in nonverbally well acted and excellent when dialogue required fun fun change of pace nc13
Jun 1 2015,positive,this may sound crazy given the ridiculous setting driving around all day looking for gas but fury road was probably the most realistic movie ive ever seen the women characters are realistic living people they are willing to take sane realistic action to save and protect themselves and their companions but are still women and human they have internal conflicts shows not talked about and are more 3 dimensional as a result no amount of dialog would have done that     furiosas physical disability is another reality never explicitly talked about or acknowledged it is just there as texture while she gets on with business without her arm it is simply a fact this matches what ive seen in real world people in similar situations     beyond the reality miller has done something really special by making a true action movie in that he uses action to tell the story most action movies are dramas with some action scenes the action is secondary it supports and enhances the story in fury road the action is the story more than that it tells the story miller does what great artists  from novelist to painters to photographers  do he removes every single thing that isnt required distilling the experience down to its purest essence trusting the audiences imagination to fill in the details in doing so he creates a far richer more nuanced story than dialog can ever do regardless of genre
Jun 1 2015,positive,intense and actionpacked the movie will do well with an audience expecting supreme visuals and adrenaline but with almost no dialogue the scenes blurred together and lost their excitement theres enough allegory to make this dystopia unique but the plot looks more like a disney screenplay than an inventive suspense flick
Jun 1 2015,negative,boring takes too long to get into the story line
Jun 1 2015,positive,undeniably unique and astoundingly fearless a refreshing actioner for a time when every action movie has been done before
Jun 1 2015,positive,fantastic film deserves the rave reviews its getting and more besides im no movie enthusiast but i loved this in a league of its own makes every other action movie ive seen look like thomas the tank engine brilliant
Jun 1 2015,positive,visually and thematically a fantastic film however the writing really brought the film down a peg i would go to the cinema and see it again     elevator pitch  tom hardy vs endless army of slipknot in an infinite car chase across the desert    if that sounds like your cup of tea then you wont be dissappinted
Jun 1 2015,positive,pulse pounding action with great visuals no plot is needed edge of my seat fun from beginning to end
Jun 1 2015,positive,fun beautiful entertaining memorable  go see it
Jun 1 2015,negative,i saw it so what the big deal  its not a bad movie there is no real plot but so what i wasnt bored just not involved now i know that i am not a part  of the target audienceim over 60 but i still like movies that have some idea where   they are going besides a sequel
Jun 1 2015,negative,if i could give this garbage no stars which flixster should make an option after the release of this movie i would no story lineafter the guitar player on the truck i knew i had wasted my money
Jun 1 2015,positive,a greatly made movie which not only keeps the feel of the originals but also brings it upto date great action and acting and even though its a bit out there the visuals and carlorrybike whatever chase scenes are second to none a must watch
Jun 1 2015,positive,double cadillacs blood banks and a flame throwing guitar millers latest masterpiece fury road is high octane and not for the weak hearted as is typical with millers franchise the film throws you at the deep end straight into a dusty oblivion polluted and dry as with the rest of mad max its best to sit back and let miller display his vision to you while the story is both fantastic and crucial the concept is what were here for the cars the stunts the rut that humanity has got itself in without going into the plot miller has created a ground breaking film that in its heart represents the objectification of both women and men it challenges hollywoods perception of womens role demonstrating that women can be leads without romantic subplots sexualisation or adopting masculine qualities to succeed it demonstrates the mind set of dictatorships and its disregard of seeing every day men as human beings  but instead cogs in a machine immortan joe himself brain washes his war boys into thinking dying in war is the most noble thing a man can do to put it simply miller has made a film that shows us what man and woman can achieve if we work together theron and hardy are both excellent theron taking the main stage and executing furiosa beautifully  a woman who clearly shares millers vision to conclude exciting beautifully shot and as usual amazing real life stunts fury road is bound to get your heart pumping high octane crazy blood
Jun 1 2015,positive,this is probably one of the best action movies i have ever seen while the movie has a rather simple story it is simply superb in every other aspect i loved the visuals i loved the practical effects i loved the cars and i really loved the female characters
Jun 1 2015,positive,yea its that damn good action comes at a fever pitch and the fact that the villains have a guy playing heavy metal music from a guitar that shoots fire is fcking excellent if you like action movies youll like fury road
Jun 1 2015,positive,packed with cgi action
Jun 1 2015,positive,amazing violence destruction fire chaos going left to right amazing violence destruction fire chaos going right to left i wont spoil the ending for you
Jun 1 2015,positive,marvellous creation a steampunk masterpiece
Jun 1 2015,positive,mad max fury road reestablishes a fantastic universe and packs two hours full of exhilarating action with costumes production and visuals off the chart and tom hardy cementing himself in the iconic role the only thing that holds back fury road is the feeling that it would play better as a long video game
Jun 1 2015,positive,i loved at how pumped this film was it left you always on the edge of your seat but the lack of dialog and a broken story at the start of the film leave you scratching your head as to what happened before the events in this film it is after all a sequel to the original film
Jun 1 2015,positive,loud noises hot chicks badassery total dude bro dude movie
Jun 1 2015,positive,just what i want to see in a summer movie
Jun 1 2015,negative,really quite terrible   after the first 30 mins i was ready to get up and leave
Jun 1 2015,negative,the only reason it got 2 stars is because it delivers on the title its absolutely mad
May 31 2015,positive,a 2 hour orgy of car chases and high production values make this the best mad max yet i guess some things do get better with age was just amazing from start to finish  v8 poetry
May 31 2015,positive,stunning visuals and a very well told story line mad max kicks every other action movies butt out of the window witness me
May 31 2015,positive,great movie want to watch again action packed

May 31 2015,positive,great movie with tons of action from the beginning to the end its nonstop chaos   very weird movie but mad max is a touch mad himself
May 31 2015,positive,this movie is amazing
May 31 2015,positive,truly  amazingnever expected  it to be so good
May 31 2015,positive,the first movie in years that both my wife and i stepped out of the theater and wanted to go back in to see it again
May 31 2015,negative,this movie is garbage never been so pissed off watching a movie at the theatre that i walked out and i want the only one
May 31 2015,positive,this is one of the best action films ive seen in a very very long time it is nonstop the whole way through make sure you go into it not expecting very much dialogue  your best bet is to just sit back relax and joy a great action film
May 31 2015,positive,this is an awesome movie  holy smokes
May 31 2015,positive,i have seen mad max two weekends in a row it has exceeded all of my expectations the dbox 3d version truly enhanced the experience compared to my 2nd viewing in a regular theater setting
May 31 2015,negative,never trusting rotting tomatoes ever again this movie was pointless and boring it had no plot and no acting how can it have such high reviews these critics must be real morons
May 31 2015,positive,the movie delivers a great narrative exceptional stunts and characters that dont take the audience for granted
May 31 2015,negative,after reading all the great reviews for this movie and the hype some of my friends had for it i was pretty excited to see this movie the trailer looked kick ass this movie was basically the trailer for 2 hours though it didnt really have enough story to keep me engaged the action graphics cinematography were great i just got bored after a while like ok this is crazy but now what well not much else just craziness i was hoping for more
May 31 2015,positive,the most fun you will have with a movie with such little plot
May 31 2015,positive,the mastermind director  even mad max 123 of mill gibson
May 31 2015,positive,not as good as i was expecting
May 31 2015,positive,just what you wanted in an action movie
May 31 2015,positive,the road warrior it will not be the last we will ever see of him 
May 31 2015,negative,as is common today lots of glitz lots of ritz yet minimal substance grab a hold of this flick for the effects alone and you just may enjoy this mindless petrol infused albeit leaky affair
May 31 2015,positive,one of the best movies i have seen in a while
May 31 2015,positive,george millers longdormant franchise is dusted off and given a new coat of paint in this explosive and dynamic revival mad max tom hardy is going through some traumatic survivors guilt as hes abducted by a posse of crazed zealots he eventually falls in with an idealistic warrior charlize theron whos dedicated to escorting a chieftens rape slaves to freedom mad max fury road has better and more creative action sequences than just about any other genre film of recent memory its likely to galvanize old fans while winning over plenty of new ones
May 31 2015,positive,not stop action
May 31 2015,positive,pretty entertaining   way way out there though  our favorite part was the road rally guitarist  crazy
May 31 2015,positive,what a movie   what a lovely movie  i saw a movie and it was perfect in every way  witness this movie
May 31 2015,positive,total chick flick super sappy with all the quite whispered i love you scenes not a lot of action 
May 31 2015,positive,it was really good i didnt expect it was going to have so much action i still need to see the original though
May 31 2015,positive,best movie i have seen this year way more than i had ever hoped for everything i wanted from an action movie i was on the edge of my seat the entire time
May 31 2015,negative,was horrible poor acting and pointless story line
May 31 2015,positive,as many other reviewers mentioned it really is remarkable what the movie achieves with so little dialogue little character development and a simple story  i am not sure there was much acting either though i would venture to say the casting was excellent  jaw dropping  sometimes it was hard to believe your eyes  outa control captivating cohesive chaos
May 31 2015,negative,positive reviews are delusional they must have seen what they wanted to see i wanted to see a really good movie but this one did not deliver several pretty cool vehicles are all that is offered there really isnt a plot or any charter development ive seen commercials with more of both ultimately the movie is 2 cool 80 pointless 8 terrible and 10 obvious missed opportunities
May 31 2015,positive,insane fun but far from perfect kinda overrated in my opinion
May 31 2015,positive,greatly exceeded my expectations
May 31 2015,positive,this is the perfect date movie for the guy  one of the most intense 2 hours of action ive ever seen for the girl  rescuing pregnant women from the slavery of the abusive and ugly king worth paying to see in 3d
May 31 2015,positive,i cannot explain the 98 this film is getting in rottentomatoes based on that i expected more  or at least something mildly original but this incarnation of mad max is no better than road warrior or thunderdome if anything it lacks the political intrigue and motivation of those films this is basically just a long chase scene and even those arent anything original it looks cool and the pace is frenetic but weve seen that in the previous two the original mad max is the oddball in the group furthermore there is so much about the max universe that makes no sense gasoline is at a premium and yet these idiots drive like madmen for fun with flaming guitars and this version does nothing to erase those gaps in logic if anything this one adds more postapocalyptic silliness  but i dont want to spoil anything tom hardy makes for a far less compelling max than gibson theron is fine but ive never been much of a fan if anything this is nicholas hoults film i have been avoiding much of the press surrounding this film but what ive gathered is that the film is drawing a lot of attention for the strong female characters which may have been contributing to the high rt percentage but i think that says more about the sad state of female roles in cinema rather than the quality of this movie save yourself the money unless you are a fan of the genre or perhaps if you have never seen the gibson max and can see this with fresh eyes
May 31 2015,positive,better than the original ones story is much better and a bit darker than the road warrior fun fun stuff
May 31 2015,positive,very interesting plot with creative characters action packed throughout the whole movie
May 31 2015,positive,very dreddish and thats a good thing
May 31 2015,positive,a well done movie but a word of advice to hollywood apocalyptic movies with dirty starving barely surviving people usually never do well at the box office
May 31 2015,negative,the only good thing about this movie is that it eventually ended  it was one long plotless bore  there were so many cliches i couldnt keep count
May 31 2015,positive,i dont remember too much about the originals but this is a fantastic film in its own right its full of action whacky characters and the special effects in 3d are the best i have ever seen  really adding a lot to the mad experience
May 31 2015,positive,the stunts were awesome and im glad practical effects are making a comeback in film making anyways i think id have to be a real fan of the franchise to truly enjoy it
May 31 2015,positive,this movie is insane once you get passed the very weird trippy craziness of this postapocalyptic world that george miller created you get a very very enjoyable summer blockbuster the acting screenplay action sequences stunts and direction are all done so well everything about this world is so over the top but yet you accept it as you watch the movie because its so well done youre immediately dropped in to it and you just accept it you dont need explanations the thing that blew me away the most was the action sequences and stunts amazing not another movie out now or that has been released in some time can hold a candle to this one and the fact that most was done conventionally is just mind blowing straight forward action packed thrill ride of a movie perfect guy movie perfect lose yourself for 2 hrs summer block buster
May 31 2015,positive,go watch this movie asap if you havent yet it is too raw
May 31 2015,negative,this movie was one long car chase with the thinnest plot i have seen in a very long time the slash wannabe strapped to one of the vehicles with bungee cords was downright laughable and only added more of a reason to mock this film
May 31 2015,positive,seriously stressful filmin a good way intense imaginative smart and eerie
May 31 2015,negative,it is hard to understand how this film is so highly rated  the violence is gratuitous the premise and action are silly the acting is soso  while there are some amusing parts like a guy playing a guitar on the hood of a car there are more than a few really ridiculous parts like a bunch of models hanging around a desert  if you do not like movies that are one long violent car chase then you may to think again before you see it
May 31 2015,positive,a salvador dali painting with motion and sound great movie from beginning to end beautiful scary and highly entertaining reminiscent of my nightmaresbut in a good way and the visual effects were nothing short of amazing theres something for everyone action pretty people tom hardyxoxoxo philosophical quagmires and an interesting story line the only critique would be lack of character back story ie what happened to furiosas arm  was that the reason she wasnt one of the kings wives nonetheless definitely one to see once or twice
May 31 2015,positive,big loud exciting visually stunning one of the most intense theatrical experiences ive ever had the screen fades to black maybe three or four times during the film just long enough to take a breath whisper holy shit and plunge into the next intense action sequence if you dont see this in the theater and i recommend 2d not 3d dont bother to see it at all this kind of spectacle is big screen only
May 31 2015,positive,i dont know what was so good about this movie it was the imagination and implementation but nothing to really wow it was boring in the middle and the characters didnt seem too defined or should i say complex charlize was good
May 31 2015,positive,this film is 80 nonstop action so for you action lovers this ones for you im a strong proponent of action with meaning or purpose meaning the action has to be placed strategically in the movie to support the story otherwise its just things blowing up for no apparent reason that gets boring good news is the action does support the story     bad news the movie does not do a good job with the main character mad max we dont really get to know his character
May 31 2015,positive,it was amazing couldnt breath lol  action all the way through the end
May 31 2015,positive,original something different to what we are used to
May 31 2015,positive,this movie i really liked it was so action packed that you couldnt really do anything you couldnt even breath or really think it kept me on the edge of my seat and everyone else on theirs to in conclusion even though this is rated r it is really sort of pg13 the only reason its rated that way is because  of a little sexual content and thats only because of the way like 6 girls are dressed and also because of all the violence there was only one little bit of gore and thats near the end
May 31 2015,positive,a fantastic action picture with surprisingly refreshing feminist undertones gory thrilling and beautifully filmed
May 31 2015,positive,acting 355  story 35  perception 45    motorized mayhem charlize and a drop of hoult thats what comes out of is one the story is as linear as they come with the aforementioned exceptions the character development is thin but the practical stunt pyrotechnics frenzy and the crazy factor take over and hush down that inner voice saying it doesnt make any sense
May 31 2015,positive,none stop action they did a great job to adapt to the original mad max style while taking advantage of cool new special effects
May 31 2015,positive,a ton of action and they didnt spend a lot of time on maxs back story cut the movie time down a lot which was good
May 31 2015,positive,good good stuff  amazing imagery and cinematography exciting nonstop action sequences great acting all around no hitting you on the head with the save the planet no nukes undertones
May 31 2015,positive,unique and succulently gory it breaks ground much like 300 did some years ago great performances by everyone involved few words lots of excitement
May 31 2015,positive,three weeks ago the world of max rockantansky was somewhat a mystery to me id seen bits and pieces of the road warrior and beyond thunder dome on tv over the past few years then the trailer for mad max fury road came screeching into theaters it was without a doubt the most intriguing trailer i have seen in the past five years i soon set out obtaining the first three movies and speeding through them in preparation for fury road from the semidystopian australia in mad max to the putrid squalled of barter town in beyond thunder dome director george miller depicts mankinds fall dissention into madness and struggle to recapture what was lost with his middle instalment the road warrior as his most fully realized vison that is until now   mad max fury road finds our antihero now played with a silent strength and yes intense madness by tom hardy struggling with visons of his slain daughter miller wastes no time moving us into the action with an intricate set piece and violent explosions usually saved for the finally of top tier action movies captured and muzzled by imortain joe and his brainwashed war boys max finds himself being used as a medical supply for the first third of the movie miller uses the opportunity to introduce us to his bizarre patriarchy led by imortain joe where woman are both objects and providers of sustenance joe has created a cult fueled by suicidal warriors who want nothing more but to die proudly for him in battle and be carried to the gates of valhalla for their eternal reward the most interesting part about the early picture is that miller explains nothing we are introduced into the world at lighting speed and operating on inferences which leads to quite the exhilarating experience   max is saved by opportunity when a female war rig driver named furiosa played with great strength and pain by charlize theron frees joes enslaved wives and high tails it to her matriarchal home land the rest of the film is essentially one of the most exciting car chases ever put on film chalked full of eye popping practical effects only letting up for the audience to clear the guzzoline from their nostrils with all this excitement fury road doesnt run out of things to say either present is strong commentary on everything from female empowerment to cult practices the real victory for miller is that all these elements meld organically into a fully realized world mad max fury road is one of the most intense and wellcrafted action films in years the fact that you leave with something to think about is just gas in the tank
May 31 2015,positive,now this is how you make a movie
May 31 2015,positive,easily the best film ive seen all year one those rare masterpieces where every area of the film seems to excel despite being a primarily action and stunt driven movie the story and characters where better than most dramas cant recommend it enough 
May 31 2015,positive,wildly unique which felt like an hour and a half of buildup that falls flat at the end  production values were top notch and actually felt the supporting cast and extras did more for the film than the leads
May 31 2015,positive,great movie especially in 3d
May 31 2015,positive,not a fan of the first three mad maxs i had very low expectations for this movie when i left the theater my mind was blown miller does a great job filming and directing the action scenes in this movie the pacing fits it well and once the movie kicks into gear it doesnt stop this my be one of the top 5 action movies ever made
May 31 2015,positive,action packed this is a must see
May 31 2015,positive,i thought it was great full of action all the way through although the film was more based on furiosa and her mission
May 31 2015,negative,not a terrible movie until they introduce the 70 yr old granny sidekicks who run  jump  and shoot with the 20 something heroes it was fun until it gets so ridiculous that you make fun of it in your head while watching what were they thinking  you will notice how the advertising and previews never show these old grannies
May 31 2015,positive,words cant even express how surprisingly good this movie turned out to be its a nonstop thrill ride with a phenomenally realized world  characters the action sequences alone are worth the price of admission especially in 3d 
May 31 2015,positive,overall a good film not 1 i would rant and rave about but wouldnt cringe if someone said they were going to see it
May 31 2015,positive,an amazing ride that kicks in the nitrox right out of the gate and does not stop  yet despite the insane pacing there is a surprisingly good story revealed by the innovative visuals the solid acting and the brief moments of  poignant dialogue i cant wait to see it again
May 31 2015,positive,good reboot i would watch it again
May 31 2015,positive,this movie is a perfect action movie  there is no unnecessary dialogue or exposition just inthemoment character and story development  and yet the cast is able to convey the complexities of their characters and the history of the postapocalypse world with body language and interpersonal interaction    that most of the action was filmed live with cgi only augmenting what couldnt be captured in reality makes it that much more visceral  what is seen on the screen is actually happening and it draws you in even more
May 31 2015,positive,it isnt necessary to shell out for 3d on this one absolutely beautiful aesthetically and a surprisingly sufficient plot
May 31 2015,negative,this movie makes no sense starts off like its been playing for 20m takes about 40 minutes to try to figure out what your watching and what the story line is
May 31 2015,positive,ok so the first ten minutes was spent with the back of eyeballs stuck to the back of my chair the film was full on action from start to finish
May 31 2015,positive,love charlize theron she was fantastic in this film great storyline
May 31 2015,positive,hope is a mistake if you cant fix whats broken you go insane     mad max is hauntingly beautiful devastatingly violent and erratically different we didnt know we wanted to reboot this franchise but we are definitely glad they did
May 31 2015,positive,rotten tomatoes quotes almost all of the lines in the movie visually detailed and fun saw it in 3d and it was thrilling like a theme park ride the guitar player is the very best detail
May 31 2015,positive,a thrill ride from start to finish fury road sets a new archetype for modern day action movies and most will fail to compete fury road just goes to show what can be accomplished with commitment to vision  and piratical effects
May 31 2015,positive,think i need to go out and buy more ammo
May 31 2015,negative,the entire movie is just one huge chase sequence   the characters dont get enough time for development   the story is barely there     the only things which are there are the explosions and gunfights
May 31 2015,negative,i am confused as to whether i saw the same movie everyone else did the whole script was probably less than 100 words i have low expectations in regard to plots in action movies but this was completely nonsensical it was like watching a teenage boys nightmare
May 31 2015,positive,it was pretty goodthe original was still better
May 31 2015,positive,mad max  the film is directed by  george miller and he was write by george miller brendan mccarthy and nick lathouris he was produce by kennedy miller productionsvillage roadshow pictures and village roadshow productions its a horror actionadventure and science fiction movie it was released in 2015 the 7th may the character played by charlize theron furiosa  and tom hardymax rockatansky was the hero of the movie because they do move the movie and he saved the lot of people  they are a lot of peopleactors in this movie because he show many tribeclan in  the movie speak of the world when in the futur when the search of the oil decline the world man kill other man for have a amazing car and waterfeeding they are a lot of groups who are lead by one dictator who control him  the script is novel because its a subject more know the world in the futur but it is eyecatching im impressed by the performances of the movie who are nice and refined the musics is sab and we are in the movie because she conveys to the scene we dont know the end and i like this because we can imagine actors good play his part because we feel sensation when we see they  the scipt is not much repetitive because the bad kill one or two good and he was search always the heroes cant dead and its damage  for me its a good movie with good script and actor scene amazing and beautiful scenery i saw him with enjoyment and i wait another part on the series mad max  i recomemendation this movie because it was a good time and he do think to the world in the futur
May 31 2015,negative,theron was great and the special effects were neat but it had no story and was gratuitously violent and bizarre with themes of rape and all manner of personal violation throughout
May 31 2015,positive,this movie was awesome it tells the story with visuals instead of dialog which is something not done much anymore also its an adrenaline rush from start to finish differently the best action film in years
May 31 2015,positive,never thought id like this movie sci fi and violence is not my cup of tea but somehow this movie did it i could help but feeling at awe by the pure creativity of the creator of the movie the victoria secret like model looking girls didnt hurt either
May 31 2015,positive,though severely lacking mel gibson the movie continues the franchise appropriately well
May 31 2015,positive,i dont eve know what to say this movie is unlike anything ive ever seen thoroughly entertaining its literally a 2 hour action scene
May 31 2015,positive,normally post apocalyptic movies are not my thing however this movie was done extremely well it was very thought provoking and the character of furiosa was phenomenal
May 31 2015,positive,best movie ive seen in a long time my heart is still pumping of course im a child of the 80s and grew up on the original mad max films
May 31 2015,negative,i think im in the minority with my rating  in one word irritating  well done direction the production value is a 50 star  but id be embarrassed to put my writing name on it  hardy and theron were onedimensional but appropriate for their roll
May 31 2015,positive,i was incredibly impressed with the latest installment on mad max over the top and extreme always but it did an excellent job of producing a plot worth following as a reader i only wish there was a place where i could learn more about the world they live in and the people they met  the detail recorded in each scene was fantastic and everyone played their roles perfectly i was particularly impressed with rosie huntingtonwhiteley who i had never seen in anything more than print ads before   i adore tom hardy and i think he played this role incredibly well now i just need to go back and rewatch the old mad max movies so i can see it all again
May 31 2015,positive,crazy overthetop action and violence this movie is great on every scale
May 31 2015,positive,quite possibly the best action movie of all time
May 31 2015,positive,such a good film tom hardy is amazing as always
May 31 2015,positive,a heart pounding thrill ride of action sequences that pummel your senses with non stop vigour sit down  buckle up  max is back  takes you on a thrill ride of your life get ready to have your head ripped off  stomped on for the next 2 hours as any action movie gear head fan will love this new reimagining of max in this deadly  diseased desolate future this is what weve been waiting for  see it in imax
May 31 2015,positive,amazing  the best summer action movie to come out in years
May 31 2015,positive,exceptional action film that delivers exactly what it tells you it will a must for action fans
May 31 2015,negative,just a tab overrated
May 31 2015,positive,was a very good movie kept you asking what is going to happen next
May 31 2015,negative,this film is a con  it is well shot and ostensibly has good chase scenes  however any analysis of the dialogue will reveal it true hidden agenda which is very much a feminist one  the producers and director have taken a icon of male independence in mad max and turned it on its head into an advert for political correctness and they think people are too stupid to notice
May 31 2015,positive,this one had the best post apocalyptic feel of any of the mad max movies but it should have been called furiosa ft mad max since theron definitely took the spotlight in lines action and relative importance as a character  im not convinced they cast max correctly but tricky to do when compared to mel gibson very glad they kept the aussie accents and really liked the cinematography great colour saturation effects
May 31 2015,positive,if you have every heard the words madness is genius you will know it all to well after watching fury road with its terrifyingly epic use of vehicles and machinery it is now arguable if fury road is more of a fantasy than a science fiction its been twenty years since the last mad max movie i have not seen a more imaginative movie since guillermo del toros earlier works hopefully we wont have to wait that long for another exciting installment
May 31 2015,positive,this is a review two imax viewings in the making and not because it was incomprehensible but because of all the badassery that i didnt quite catch the first time if you dont want to read this inevitably wordy review then ill just say this go watch the movie in the biggest loudest way possible    so if you havent seen the previous mad max movies i recommend the road warrior theyre violent and gritty tales told in the postapocalyptic wasteland of australia the highlight usually being the the crazy bad guys at the lead of these stories is max rockatansky previously played by mel gibson now played by tom hardy who used to be a cop of sorts but now he belongs to the mad as far as characters go hes actually not the most interesting one this is kind of a tradition for max with the exception of the first movie max is usually just caught in the middle of someone elses ongoing problems with his only motivations being getting stuff for his long and lonely road ahead this movie kind of keeps the tradition going but it doesnt at the same time since the last movie max has actually succumbed to his craziness and become more of a wild animal than a straight thinking person     through fortuitous events he soon unites with furiosa played by charlize theron who let me tell you is the real badass of this movie seriously this is the best ive seen charlize theron you just totally buy her awesomness and its not just that shes a total badass but the central story revolves around her this movie may as well have been called furiosa road and the interesting characters dont stop their theres also nux played by nicholas hoult who belongs to the group of crazies trying to chase down max and furiosa i knew for a while that hoult was a cool guy to watch onscreen but his role as nux totally flips what you ever thought about him hes just batshit as in his motivations dont really make sense but its those motivations that drive him as a character and this is the first time you see this from the crazies perspective in a mad max movie the bad guy immortan joe who played toecutter in the first movie is also one of the sickest bad guys in movie history he has a kickass breathing mask and just an overall intimidating presence about him that would just make you shit your pants if you met him in real life    but enough of all this character nonsense lets get to the real star of the movie the fucking action well firstly theres a surprising amount of story and it actually carries a lot of heart and emotion but i dont wanna bore you with that this movie is a spectacle of eye candy and explosions almost everything you see exploding flipping and crashing is made with practical effects meaning no cgi unless the moment really calls for it and its all just so relentless and an assault on your senses in the best possible way and its all shown in beautiful wide shots with a kickass soundtrack to get you pumped for the rest of the ride    to summarize george miller brought mad max back to the big screen with a vengeance while max isnt the quite the main character in his own movie him and everyone else are awesome to watch an honorable mention for the doof warrior there was a surprisingly good story and the incredible set pieces make mad max fury road possibly the best action move of the decade so far 910
May 30 2015,positive,its a bit silly but so much fun truly a mad max film
May 30 2015,negative,its a 2 hour car chase with a hackneyed line thrown in every few minutes should have saved the 20 and just watched the trailer on loop
May 30 2015,negative,wow loud nonsensical action sequence to yet another loud nonsensical action sequence coherent plot interesting characters subtlety mad max fury road has no need of such things ooh explosion ooh loud car chase rinse and repeat     the sexual politics are not as interesting as advertised women good and noble men despotic fools wow very compelling     i dont get how this is getting good reviews
May 30 2015,positive,easily one of my favorite movies of all time
May 30 2015,positive,best popcorn movie of 2015 big screen a mustsee
May 30 2015,positive,holy crap wow this is one you have to see in theaters do it
May 30 2015,negative,boring didnt like it at all the characters surrounding max were annoying and boring could and should have been better
May 30 2015,positive,the absolute definition of a nonstop thrillride tom hardy is great and charlize theron is fantastic mad max fury road is one of the most exhilarating intense and impressive action films in recent memory instant classic  a
May 30 2015,positive,stop reading this review and go see it now
May 30 2015,positive,cirque de soliel does a demolition derby  dismantling the patriarchy while flying through the desert with not quite the greatest of ease
May 30 2015,positive,the absolute definition of a nonstop thrillride tom hardy is great and charlize theron is fantastic mad max fury road is one of the most exhilarating intense and impressive action films in recent memory instant classic  a
May 30 2015,positive,its a must see and i will be buy the bluray
May 30 2015,negative,youve got to be kidding me george miller and crew should be embarrassed by this work of drivel predictable unrealistic you dont care about any of them especially max way too much cgi we almost walked out but stuck with it for some reason
May 30 2015,positive,movie of the year screw the oscars
May 30 2015,positive,outstanding movie  everything about this is perfection
May 30 2015,positive,definitely need to see this again just an absolutely fantasticbrilliant movie breath taking intense immersive words can hardly describe the epicness   55
May 30 2015,negative,2 hour action sequence with no plot no emotional connection built with the characters so many loopholes like not explaining the blood transfusion boils spraying of face etc and to top it all furiosa decides to only save the hot women and not the big mamas and feminists still like the movie doyouknowwhatfeminismmeans
May 30 2015,positive,tom hardy charlize theron and nicholas hoult came together to make a classic and actionpacked spectacular that should be destined to become a classic
May 30 2015,positive,this movie is a fking masterpiece its brilliant on every single level and is easily the best mad max film to date its my favorite film so far this year and i cant imagine any other upcoming movie topping this you owe it to yourself to see this if you havent already 
May 30 2015,positive,there might have been 6 or 7 minutes without action  the movie is so action packed with so many explosions  it puts michael bay to shame
May 30 2015,negative,fury road is a movie in which action speaks louder than words miller and his production team fill the screen with a wide variety of amazing and impressive stunts which will have you gaping in disbelief while holding the dialogue to a minimum exactly why i hated it
May 30 2015,negative,im sorry  i really wanted to like this  i have always enjoyed the mad max franchise i like tom hardy and i adore charlize theron but this movie is a posterchild for what happens when you give a director too much money to play with    when the movie is set in a postapocalyptic future where things people need to survive are almost nonexistant  how can you justify having a large truck carry around a guitar player with a 12 foot high stack of amplified speakers behind him and the guitar gushes flames where do you get a supercharged car that runs on tank tracks imho if you are going to do a movie like this you should  have your props people build everything from scratch from things they find in junkyards    and how about a least a semblance of a plot there is an itttybittyteenytiny bit of character development but my 7 year old grandson could come up with a better plot line  run this way while bad guys chase you and when you finally elude them run back the other way and let them chase you some more    it was a waste of time and money
May 30 2015,positive,the boyest boy movie i have ever seen monster trucks in a desert with explosions and guitars yeah i jest however testosteronefilled this film boasts technical achievements that make for a worthy watch i wish tom hardy had more than oneword grunts and there was a tinge more backstory but what can you do
May 30 2015,negative,i thought this movie sucked really bad
May 30 2015,positive,i cannot believe the number of people and reviews that have completely misunderstand the story of mad max the raggedy man  so many reviews upset about the fantastic showing of charlize theron as the imperator furiosa and in my opinion such a worthy dynamic and fantastic strong female lead in a timeless story  ok here i go  you dumb asses  thinking this is some weird antimale epic is beneath any male at this time in the 21st centuryyou male orienteddominating baboons are totally missing the point  you mouth breathers obviously dont read  read the story by george miller and byron kennedy before you offer an opinion  on a story this awesome you jellobrained dolts  max has never been the pivot point or the focus he is and will always be the wild card he is a tortured soul out of place suffering from debilitating loss having travelled through a crucible of fire and pain but also with skills and ability worthy of heroics and a long lost code he lives on the periphery the blind spot the shadows  if if he feels your cause balances within his mental anguish and within the direction of his travel and ultimately if he finds you worthy of his time and you are at the right place at the right time you could run across the raggedy man the unknown the eternal question mark you incipient dolts he is no male standard bearer he is max the survivor the equalizer whom no one expects he is an unassuming warriora selfdescribed wasteofresources who is unexpectedly inserted into the lives of toecutter bubba zanetti johnny the boy wez lord humungus aunty entity and most recently immortan joe  in the wasteland your lucky if he throws his hand into the ring and supports your cause and if you are really worthy he may tell you his name if your going his way  know the story before you bitch
May 30 2015,positive,i havent stopped thinking about this movie i feel like i need to watch it once a day for the rest of the year to quench my ongoing thirst fury road is an adrenaline packed action movie powered by guitar ballads no really there is a guy strapped to the front of a semi and he plays his guitar while in battle and it shoots fire this is a real thing it is absolutely amazing simply because of the ridiculousness that is the job i want once the world has become a giant wasteland     tom hardy is one of my favorite actors he was a perfect fit for max he is smart and strong and completely mad this is one of the worlds i wish i knew everything about what the heck happened to the earth what disease is in their bones why do only certain people have it why is it mainly men who makes all these kickass cars who thought up all of these awesome cars who is the guy playing the flame guitar     ill give you a little bit of the plot if you still arent convinced that you need to see it max is picked up by these very pale men who are madder than him they have a creepy leader who has a bunch of wives if i had to sleep with and carry this guys babies i would be super pissed charlize theron is imperator furiosa she is a military leader that finally decides to help his wives escape once the leader catches wind of whats happened he sends out most of his guys to get his wives back max is essentially a blood bag for nicholas hoults character he is strapped to his car like the picture above im thankful im not a universal donor eventually max and furiosa join forces there isnt any romance and its great its purely action with cars and weapons and explosions and fire and amazing filming and amazing acting i really hope the next one doesnt take 10 years to make    all praise the v8
May 30 2015,negative,the last time i saw a movie this bad was 30 years ago when the last mad max was made so disappointed
May 30 2015,positive,so weird you just have to embrace the world and jump in
May 30 2015,negative,i cant believe the positive reviews this movie received  it stunk it is an uninterrupted twohour long mutant chase scene and thats it there is no story there is almost no dialogue there is no reason to care about what happens to any character  good or bad dont waste your time or money in either the theater or rental
May 30 2015,negative,really guys why all the good ratings mad max fury road is a redundant cliche and exhausting reboot of the superior original films even if you are looking for just a mindless action movie you may want to rethink stepping in line to grab a ticket heres why    we see max a man whose lost everything including the title of main character in his own movie max is brushed aside to make way for a onedimensional female character looking for redemption fromwe dont really know we also meet a character who gets more screen time then max and does absolutely nothing for the story    the action is insanely repetitive  and never changes there is no diversity between the antagonists and little character developement makes them all the more bland the struggles becomes more and more anticlimactic because of the obvious ending to each situation the good guy is in danger and at the last moment is saved next scene     the visuals are quite good and the acting and dialogue are fine but what kills the movie is the story line theres no depth and it leaves nothing to the imagination it leaves you with no suspense because its a storyline thats been done before and we all know the ending    im all for reboots but please writers either stick to the story or give us something fresh     i give it 25
May 30 2015,negative,action was great and visually stunningbut who cares  with no character development and zero plot how can you care about what is on the screen action is meaningless with no build up  not even a backstory to cling to really i dont know what the five star people are seeing in this film but i must have missed it
May 30 2015,positive,this movie kicks ass go see it
May 30 2015,positive,hella ultra mega sick this film was like if gwar has a baby with itself and the fetus flew out of the womb like a gymnast on fire i cant remember the last film that i held my breath for multiple times guess i shouldnt have expected anything less from a movie with car chases that literally include a guy playing heavy metal on a guitarflame thrower
May 30 2015,positive,warning do not wait for dvd unless you have a huge screen    the best time to see this movie is while it is in theaters it is an experience that cant be felt while viewing on a regular tv screen it is all about cinematography and special effects the story is simple but still good
May 30 2015,positive,intense throughout most part disturbing part entertaining and last but not least epic carnage
May 30 2015,negative,maybe its because im in my 70s but i hated it
May 30 2015,positive,it was good as far as insane cars and explosions go but honestly it seems like feminism has gotten to mad max as well this was like mad max girl power so i was disappointed with that otherwise great movie
May 30 2015,negative,so stupid i feel dumber for watching half of this train wreck  this movie makes tank girl and beyond thunderdome look like pure genius  ajfhjfhf9uhrufhfnkjbe damn i it made me so dumb i cant spell anymore      ban the the director from hollywood so he doesnt get to make more stupid movies
May 30 2015,positive,if you enjoy a good actionpacked movie go see this
May 30 2015,negative,i dont know what is with all the positive reviews on this piece of garbage  probably worse than hot tub time machine 2  horrible cheesy acting and filming  it reminded me of a bad cut scene from guitar hero    absolutely the worst movie ive seen this year
May 30 2015,positive,surprisingly liked it quite a bit even despite the heightened anxiety it gave me along with visuals ready to warrant a few nightmares only thing missing tina turner 
May 30 2015,negative,horrible and disappointing this movie is so overrated
May 30 2015,positive,most thrilling experience ive ever had in a theater
May 30 2015,negative,action sequencies 100 story line 0 the special effects choreography and acting of theron is superb but thats the only thing going for this movie there is no story the movie is meaningless i had to fight getting sleepiness while watching it
May 30 2015,neutral,so many holes in the story so annoyed however i do like the fact that they made females more of a real fighters and heros in a movie that is named after the male lead
May 30 2015,positive,george miller paints a striking visual canvas with fury road blending practical effects and dynamic choreography with some truly magnificent cg backdrops which are often reminiscent of the atmosphere created by those old star wars matte paintings during the films opening sequences i often found myself smiling with a delight at millers innovations and ideas although i hated the silly band on wheels nonsense  this was at odds with the otherwise grim atmosphere and too far beyond the laws of physics for me to enjoy  it was as if miller second guessed himself and decided to lighten the mood out of fear that the audience would be too stressed by the action     the rudimentary exposition allows the films narrative and concepts to breathe and develop as the chase reaches its conclusion  fine performances from the key players although hardys strange accent at times distracts colour the amazingly detailed set pieces with a forceful human presence but are at best diminished and at worst utterly destroyed by junkie xls awful score which is often unbelievably incongruous and cheap sounding  i am utterly sick and tired of being told how to feel by a soundtrack and this mess of hack scoring totally ruined the experience for me several times     i wondered if i should feel cheated by the fact that max is not the protagonist and that this is essentially mad furiosa but i cant think of a good reason why a mad max film cant be told from the point of view of max as he participates in rather than drives the narrative fury road is certainly the most interesting story from the series so far
May 30 2015,positive,giving this movie 4 stars for action  there is an underlying plot but that isnt really what this film is about  this film is about wildass action and crazy stunts special effects and lots and lots of explosions  i get why people like it  i was entertained by it  the guitarist was a nice little bit of a punchline throughout the action sequences
May 30 2015,positive,this is why we go to the movies  best summer movie i have seen in many years
May 30 2015,positive,mad max furiosa is the protagonist in this action filled very entertaining feminist journey movie a shoe in to win several awards for costume and set design one of the most convincing alternate world ive seen in quite some time
May 30 2015,positive,one of the greatest action movies ive ever seen the ride never stops in this film its a blast from start to finish
May 30 2015,positive,for a film that could have easily exploited its content george miller manages to tastefully create a two hour powerhouse that puts its story and characters front and center
May 30 2015,positive,the bestmadmax movie ever made
May 30 2015,positive,great movie you will not be disappointed this was my favorite movie for 2015 i just want to lay it out there that this is a must watch it is also a guy movie just a heads up for all your families out there
May 30 2015,positive,balls to the wall fucking insanity
May 30 2015,positive,one crazy ass thrill ride
May 30 2015,negative,i cant believe this movie still has such high ratings  everyone in the very highend theater i saw it in went out shaking their headstoo much unending action this film is meant for fps gamehappy teen boys
May 30 2015,positive,madmaxfuryroad instareview royalreview  friday may15     i only saw madmaxbeyondthunderdome of the original melgibson madmax trilogy and all i recall from that is the tinaturner song and outfits so my expectations for this one was quite open kinda like markwahlbergâs remake of thegambler late last year     well this movie makes me wanna forgive gibsonâs recent transgressions and check out the originals because this film is offdachain itâs stunning the fact that the director is the same as the original mad max films is even more incredible i can honestly say that iâve never seen anything like this on screen ever iâm not usually a fan of postapocalyptic depictions on screen one notable exception willsmithâs iamlegend the world portrayed in this movie is reminiscent of jabathehuts world in starwars returnofthejedi     the action sequences pretty much the entire film will leave you breathless i literally exhaled at the end of each they leave you captured so much so that you miss them when their gone but hold on they will be back     the film has âmad maxâ in the tile but the opening credits lets us know that tomhardy and charlizetheron have equal billing in the movie hardyâs max is a man of very few words theronâs furiosa ranks up there with sigourneyweaverâs ripley in aliens and lindahamiltonâs sarahconnor in the terminator movies     what i loved most about the film is that i had no idea what the story was about until he rolled out on the screen so i wonât summarize the story here to allow you that same pleasure as i see it you will either love this movie or hate this movie if after 30 minutes when the general plot pretty much unfolds youâre not enamored then not much will happen to change your mind a shout out to nicholashoult recently seen as thebeast in the xmen films who plays nux a disciple of immortanjoe nux will go to any length necessary to win the immortanâs praise thereâs not much back story in this film which makes it even more incredible damn iâve already said too much        my score 9outof10
May 30 2015,positive,it is impossible not to be both dazzled and awe struck by the sheer ingenuity imagination intensity and unhinged insanity of the largely analog chase  fight sequences and george millers revisit to his own creation is essentially an extended adrenaline and rage fueled car chase following the same bleak stretch of terrain twice  once running away from and then running back the george millers return to his original idea is over flowing with innovation creativity and intensity when it comes to the visual presentation of what is essentially two brutal death metallike car derby chase and war that stretches the same barren wasteland of sand twice the level of intensity violence gore and mayhem make for one hell of a ride that continues to escalate and amp up with each passing minute the spectacle of this film is unique and unforgettable  however that is pretty much the whole movie based on the many praises this film has received i expected something smarter than what i got there are a number of interesting ideas here but never examined at any level approaching depth this is just an unusually visually wellcrafted ride of horrors and that carries a great deal of entertainment for a lot of people millers film should be praised but a rating of 98 is over doing it if you are anticipating something with intellectual or emotional insight you will be let down the one new aspect to the mad max adventure is mad max himself tom hardy is allowed to convey a far more complex realistic and damaged character i never picked anything remotely like that from mel gibsons max in this more fully realized film mad max is a broken man who is not only lost but slowing slipping into insanity as he makes his way through a bleak reality that is a constant barrage of sadistic torture cruelty and horrors the visual power of the film is mindblowing sadly you might feel a bit like tom hardy as you leave the cinema and attempt to adjust your senses
May 30 2015,positive,best action movie best script best actress best romance idek best everything  unexpected feels and plot and friendship and losers and ships there needs to be a sequel tiein comic novelization merchandise i want that arm
May 30 2015,positive,clip your nails because mad max fury road will have you ruining chair arms if you dont    george miller has masterfully welded together a neat gritty and chaotically choreographed dance of metal mayhem this point is highlighted with scenes of apocalyptic war drums accompanied by a madred jumpsuit donned stringed ax thrasher who strums and picks notes during amany doomed pursuits    one of the most talented and varied cinematographers that exists in the industry john seale punches bold and mesmerizing hues of rust sweat life and zeal through the audiences optical pipes seizing the imagination    madman of the hour max tom hardy has few lines instead he communicates more by what he doesnt saywhich i found ideal for the character his suspicion that all minds are tortured in one way or another and how miller illustrated those mental episodes lets me feel connected to the character in that special way that elevates a movie from an experience to an interaction    rebellious charming and astute imperator furiosa charlize theron must have missed the memo about the title of the movie anyone would have trouble defending max as being the lead in this movie  this is not a complaint    remaining cast were aces in my book    car chases were spectacular and certainly blurred the lines between special and visual effects my only complaint is that despite the movie being titled fury road there could have been less vehicular venery    spoiler alert ahead  scale is scoped in epic proportions throughout much of  this flick mile high dust storms desert plains hordes of monster truck luxury transports motorcycles and ratrod clod busters are barely contained onscreen encapsulating this fact is at the tail end of the climax as the mixed group of protagonists contemplate their futures into an apparent dried up ocean bedgazing to the haze of the foreboding horizon to cross it on motorcycle would take over one hundred and sixty days    while not my preferred octane of choice mad max fury road is an addition to the franchise that many will aspire to replicate some will use to motivate but all respectable fans of cinema will appreciate
May 30 2015,positive,full time thrills  all senses to the max
May 30 2015,positive,awesome movie id go see it again
May 30 2015,positive,all five stars to art direction so many things and references come to mind burning man monster vehicles steampunk im not even sure what was first all these or the mad max world need to do more wikipedia research im sure about one thing though  here it all shines to the tiniest detail spoilers from the metal nose cap on the fat guy to the muscle car mounted on a tank tread to the convulsing leg of the redvelvetclad guitarist from hell those are just a few images that wont escape my memory fast   what a day what a lovely day 
May 30 2015,positive,not quite the masterpiece some would have you believe but an enormously welcome diversion from the studioled cgi heavy efforts that seem to dominate the genre a blisteringly intense relentless ride
May 30 2015,positive,heart pounding chaos and destruction  a cast of characters who are freaky  way too much fun   it is an exercise in survival
May 30 2015,negative,stylish and extremely committed attention to detail but ultimately too violent
May 30 2015,positive,the minimal cgi and dialogue and maximum technical brilliance make this pretty amazing
May 30 2015,neutral,although technically spectacular this vastly overrated addition to the mad max franchise offers precious little that we havent already seen three times before what minor narrative twists that have been included here are greatly overshadowed by an underdeveloped back story underwhelming character development of the protagonist and an overreliance on overlong action sequences that become predictable and boring over time hype may help sell a movie but it doesnt make it better
May 30 2015,positive,fast paced explosive action packed and excellent
May 30 2015,positive,okeveryone loved it more than mejust not enough storyconversation in it for meseemed just like a really long and loud drive back and forth across desertonly high pointwas charlize therons performance it was awesome
May 30 2015,positive,love the action best film so far 2015
May 30 2015,positive,incredible the best action movie of the year and maybe one of the best ever
May 30 2015,positive,this was by far the best money i have ever spent in the movie theatre  i have never stopped and thought about buying another ticket to watch a movie right away again and if i didnt have a family to get back to i probably would have
May 30 2015,negative,98 rating what is wrong with people today this isnt really a movie at all its got no plot no suspense no drama its a two hour montage of stylised car crashes its basically porn
May 30 2015,positive,great visual with depth perception magic  a twist on pace unlike the horror head twisted backward crawl like a spider move but something along that line good story and like able characters a must see
May 30 2015,positive,miller has raised the bar of action movies now others will find it very difficult to live up one of the best action sequence movies i have ever seen expecting the sequel to be even more deadlier
May 30 2015,positive,weird but spectacularly weird
May 30 2015,positive,this movie blew up my face great flick
May 30 2015,positive,probably the most thrilling movie going experience in recent memory
May 30 2015,positive,an instant classic not merely a cult one but universal there is no department where this  movie is less then superb starting with haunting interior makeup and characters soon on the shoulders of furiosa it enters into a new direction of astonishing graphics story and deadly action which not only drop your jaw but make you forget to breath action sequence are as amazing as never before acting from top to bottom is to be praised and from top i mean theron though named as mad max but this is furiosas story and movie belongs to charlize theron she gives another oscar worthy performance tom hardy is good in his role and portrays the complication character needs nicholas hault is good too who really surprised was rosie hutington whiteley she might have given her best to the screen  in the end the real crown goes to george miller who brought this unique thrilling adventure to the screen
May 30 2015,positive,super cool  hope to see a sequel
May 30 2015,positive,action after action after action there was so much action that they involved old ladies in the film that kicked ass in the action scene
May 30 2015,positive,unique action packed and full to the brim   this is one movie that is begging to be turned into a cult classic if you want your adrenaline level raised for 2 hours straight then this is the movie for you
May 30 2015,positive,where were all the prius death machines
May 30 2015,positive,great action and flow of the story line mad max was acting more of serious mad guy and not as a crazy funny mad guy
May 30 2015,positive,stunning visuals make for a gripping and powerful film  the action sequences are expertly choreographed and the cinematography is memorable  this is a film made to see on the big screen  the movie is relentless pushing you forward through the action until it pauses and you can take a breath  the experience of this film immerses you into this bleak future world where survival is the only rule
May 30 2015,positive,oooooo maan this movie has the best action sequencesreally welldone everyoneand the special effects that make the movie more polished amazing
May 30 2015,positive,good for what it is  action movie
May 30 2015,positive,last night i saw the finest movie ive seen in a long time  a master epic featuring valiant heroes a deep resonating story and a gripping storytelling style that literally had me on the edge of my seat when the credits rolled i cheered  along with most of the audience what you may find surprising is that the movie was mad max  fury road critics and audiences across the board have given it a rating in the high 90 or 5 stars im already planning to go see it again  soon hard people are forced to deal hard times heroes are crafted as they continually make the difficult decision to simply keep moving forward villains actively pursue wickedness without any of the well mommy didnt love them enough nonsense so prevalent in media today hope betrays yet hope goes on the trailers give an accurate depiction of the chaotic roadwarrior style which makes the movie so much fun yet despite the ease with which it could have taken a particular stereotypical road it chose to be brutal without slipping into gore and contained almost no bad language or sensuality almost unbelievably most of the overthetop vehicles jawdropping stunts and chaotic chase scenes are real rather than cgi fantasies i looked it up moviegoers have nearly forgotten what real gravity and physics feel like what punishment the human body and psyche can and can not absorb this movie reminds us go see it if you can before its theater showing is replaced with some shallow summer blockbuster designed to take our money and time and give us nothing in return this movie gave me back a piece of myself  i walked out vibrating with power it truly is one of the stories i look for as the story seeker the stories that remind us who we are and encourage us to become whom we are meant to be 
May 30 2015,positive,wow can i just say one of the most amazing films i have ever seen
May 30 2015,negative,mad max was not the main character and the acting was often wooden
May 30 2015,negative,didnt understand the hype at all a really long car chase scene basically it was cool for about 30 minutes then i was ready for it to be over
May 30 2015,positive,almost constant action that is top notch and a good story to boot
May 30 2015,positive,best action movie this year
May 30 2015,positive,amazing film intense thrilling violent masterpiece
May 30 2015,negative,what the freak  literally    such a waste of time id give it negative stars if i could i need to be more careful following ratings here 90 for what
May 30 2015,positive,everything you want an action movie to be but never has been non stop but it somehow finds its emotional core without being the least bit cloying perfect
May 30 2015,positive,the best action film of the year strong character development great performances charlize theron deserves oscar consideration plot pacing and directing makes this such a great movie tom hardy may have the top billing he had very few lines yet it was effective and true to his character but it is the women in this movie that are the stars
May 30 2015,positive,ok didnt really do it for us took itself way too seriously and thus spoilt all the over the top action sequences
May 30 2015,positive,a movie of few words and a ston of action that was amazingly intense and compelling 
May 30 2015,positive,driven by its beautiful intense action scenes great action and style mad max fury road proves why actions speak louder than words
May 30 2015,positive,brilliant film not quite as good as road warrior but definitely close
May 30 2015,positive,i dont think ive ever seen a movie like this so fucking awesome non stop action
May 30 2015,positive,its a movie that needs to be watched a few times there are no brakes in this film so prepare yourself for this badass ride
May 30 2015,positive,as much depth allowed by a legendary action film series and then some
May 30 2015,positive,everything about this movie was fantastic its an action movie that transcends the boundaries of what might be expected of it it is exhilarating and interesting in every detail i feel people are misguided when they expect it to be a mans film or even a feminist film because it transcends both these things as a truly believable struggle for freedom hope and redemption
May 30 2015,positive,ok best parts are in previews
May 30 2015,negative,stupid movie nothing like the original very disappointing
May 30 2015,positive,mad max was everything i needed it to be and more every single frame was beautiful necessary and damn near peerless  in an era where action movies use the nub of a very old crayon to connect the dots to show you a picture you could see before you started mad max gives you the side of a barn blasts it with 40000 rounds of buckshot and dares you to try to find the first dot  find the biggest screen you can and enjoy   the trailer says from mastermind george miller and i cant argue  on par with the good the bad and the ugly and not much else
May 30 2015,positive,so i just saw mad max fury road and it was pretty great  this is that rare blockbuster we get every couple of years that manages to be impressive as a whole  the biggest thing that surprised me was how much attention to detail their was to the setting and characters  its these fun world building ideas that we can infer that is part of what makes this movie so engrossing  and although it isnt too story driven id say this is a movie that understands how ridiculous it is  i dont know about you but if youre going to show a world without law and order then i expect to see weird and chaotic repercussions  key word being show because was it ever refreshing to see a movie that strays away from the common faults its peers tend to have      the most striking being the action  the action is shot in visceral wide shots with daring stunts  and although their was action that wasnt practical and relied on cg they didnt distracted too much from the movie and sometimes even added to overall atmosphere  even if thats all that mad max was it would still be impressive to me but it took an extra step  not only did the action have some real weight to it but so did the emotion  this is a movie where i felt tension for our characters  the introspective of the danger happening was clear and i even got goosebumps on more than one occasion      now unfortunately there are a couple of issues  their was a questionable edit of a fade to white that didnt show the contact between a headbutt  its the one time it happens in the movie and its not like the movie shied away from violence so why just that time  also i didnt really buy into maxs haunted illusions  it never felt as serious as much as it was trying to implying  personally id have preferred if it shown crazier imagery  this is a look into a psyche of someone who is puts on shades mad  these illusion do take a noticeable amount of movie so it kept taking me a bit  there were some bad green screen shots where i swear i saw the hue around the actors  its a shame that these small production issues are as noticeable as they are in a movie that has otherwise great setpieces     this is the kind of movie i see growing on me  as someone whos never seen a mad max movie i was pretty damn satisfied  it was weird it was selfaware and above all it was just plane fun  in a year thats been pretty underwhelming im happy to say that this is the best movie ive seen so far and im giving this an 810
May 30 2015,negative,i dont know why this movie has scored so high but it seems that the amount of tasteless film critics are rising 1 star
May 29 2015,positive,good mad update on the franchise
May 29 2015,negative,absolutely one of the worst movies ive ever seen never before have i left the theater wanting a refund or wishing i could erase the last few hours from my mind not only did it lack a real and suspenseful or purposeful plot but it was poorly executed hardly anything was actually explained who did kill the world or why max had the nightmares why are these people deformed all any of the action scenes were smoke and mirrors to distract from the lackluster plot if i could give this negative stars i would
May 29 2015,positive,the best movie of 2015 just for this moment
May 29 2015,positive,its ironic that mad max will likely be the movie to save the oscars this year in 30 years some kid is going to pull this movie off the shelf watch it and say damn that was a bad ass movie there are a lot of other films that have won oscars these last few years that will never get such a true and pure response from an audience
May 29 2015,positive,best action film since the dark knight a master study on character without dialouge world without narration or long exposition and action with relying on cgi not to mention that hilarious blind guitar player
May 29 2015,positive,highly imaginative and incredibly unique even if i was confused half the time mad max is the best summer blockbuster of 2015    for those who havent seen any of the mad max films prepare to be confused george miller wastes no time giving any back story to its story or characters which makes me wonder why critics have responded so positively to storytelling method usually dismissed youre plopped right in the driver seat from the start with that said the film is still highly enjoyable    just sit back in awe of these unbelievable action sequences and try not think that this movie is directed by the guy that brought you happy feet
May 29 2015,negative,terrible movie no plot nor point how did this movie get the green light to even be made
May 29 2015,positive,possibly the best action movie ever made i love the cinematography and costume design just a beautiful film
May 29 2015,positive,this movie is off the charts good youve gotta like metal movies because this movie is just that bad ass from start to finish
May 29 2015,positive,action packed but i dont see why it got a 98 it was lacking some detail   in the story
May 29 2015,positive,one of the best action films of the summer and possibly of the past few years the script and acting are so strong especially from one of the fiercest female leads of the decade ms charlize theron this film is worth seeing for the car battle scenes alone but throw in everything else and mad max fury road easily holds up to a third or fourth viewing do yourself a favor and see this on the theater with a coke and popcorn on the largest screen you can find
May 29 2015,positive,lots of good authentic action and a simple plot keeps you engaged in the movie could use more depth but considering the apocalyptic theme of the movie it was a pretty good movie
May 29 2015,neutral,ok this was straight nuts i dont know how to describe it at all
May 29 2015,positive,i watched this movie with my mouth open in absolute awe  i missed the first 15 minutes so that gives me the perfect excuse to go see it again    not that i need one  it was just that good
May 29 2015,positive,this movie is crazy as helllol d  its fun to watch thoughnever a dull moment
May 29 2015,positive,definitely lives up to the hype who wants to go see it again next week
May 29 2015,positive,truly a masterpiece go watch it you are missing out
May 29 2015,negative,this was a horrible film filled with continuous gratuitous violence character development  are you kidding i wish i could give it zero stars
May 29 2015,negative,this movie was so dull and boring just driving up and down one road yelling and shooting  so dumb so not chrome just a bunch of pea brain ants running around trying to bite each other for two hours
May 29 2015,positive,i usually dont like this kind of movie but this was great
May 29 2015,positive,absolutely ridiculous and entertaining as hell
May 29 2015,negative,this movie was horrible  the plot is dumb and characters are boring  save your money and rewatch the original
May 29 2015,negative,sure the movie was visual stunning but when the actors only have 100 lines between them the plot is not existent this is one of those movies you wish would end 20 minutes in
May 29 2015,positive,ive bee waiting of max return for 30 yearsit was excitingheart poundingi give thumbs on the story explore the other characters rather then max how the female fighters and the brides of immortan joe on their journey to the greenland just to finds out that immortan joes kingdom is the only hope no information about how furiousa lost her left handbut easily conclude that furiose was a loyal to immortan joe that turn her back against joe after she knew that joe cruely imprison the best women to give birth for joes offspring max important role begins when the female warriors starts to desperate and he give them the crazy idea which is insane choice but is also the best choice and worth itbetter then die in salt desert in the midle of nowhere finally the better world belongs to the mad and after a hard days of journey ends in happy ending in the afternoon when u can say what a lovely day
May 29 2015,negative,a half hour into this movie around the time when the flamethrowing guitar player appeared i turned and asked my partner at some point does this movie have a coherent plot line  count me among those who thinks this is one of the worst movies ever made
May 29 2015,positive,action action action until the end  if you love charlize theron and tom hardy you will enjoy the movie for sure
May 29 2015,positive,i cant even put into words how much i loved this movie go see it go see it
May 29 2015,positive,honestly speaking 6 stars but i guess that is not allowed here hands down best scifi movie in a while the acting the script the action the score just go and do yourself a favor watch it
May 29 2015,negative,was good but liked mad max with mel g
May 29 2015,positive,definitely deserves this rating
May 29 2015,positive,i would say this is hands down one of the best action films  nay one of the best films  that i have ever seen the visual effects were astounding the plot and story arc was surprisingly weighty the character development was on point and despite several similar sequences with the cars it never felt repetitive or boring everything felt fleshed out and completely awesome added bonus so much girl power i would happily watch this again and again maybe a few more times who knows  but seriously if youre even considering it go and see this movie
May 29 2015,positive,certainly adrenaline filled the revamped mad max has everything except for unpredictability in structure in acts 2 and 3
May 29 2015,positive,better than avengers best action flick of the year so far
May 29 2015,positive,now this is an action movie mad max fury road is a fastpaced crazy and electrifying thriller
May 29 2015,positive,action from being to end  great movie
May 29 2015,positive,crazy and over the top my kind of action movie loved it
May 29 2015,negative,really  this was repetitive and uninteresting  bad writing and ultimately a failure
May 29 2015,positive,director george miller establishes that a great action movie is about more than the stuntwork its about the morality and the outcome in a movie where even in the most frenzied crashes and violence have a coherence and clarity
May 29 2015,positive,kinsman the secret service   avengers age of ultron  mad max fury road tramples all of the above the fact is the first mad max was great the second fantastic and the third not to bad just not a mad max film but thank god george miller came back and created this masterpiece of well directed explosive fun even though tom hardy is an absolute boss i still i prefer mel gibson but that doesnt matter the main plot is a classic mad max plot and thats what i love george tried something different with mad max 3 and it didnt work and like people say you learn from your mistakes yes sir nothing in this film made me not enjoy the film at all its best to watch the prequels before but you dont have to film will be better if you do but yes this is definitely the best film of 2015 so far last note nux is one of my favourite movie characters
May 29 2015,positive,this movie is absolutely incredible  the effects are perfectly done the action is always meaningful and the violence is necessary  as a film driven by outstanding female roles this film impresses not only in its ability to bring many different types of characters to the forefront but it also avoids the gratuitous sexual violence against women that often finds its way into modern action films  cannot wait for this halloween
May 29 2015,positive,music score was fantastic you dont really have to have had to see the previous sequels of mad max excellent as one of my mates says you werent short of action plot was not as clear but from what i could get was furiosatheron was asked by immortankeaysbyrne to deliver or collect cant recall she instead went off course to east where maxhardy comes in i dont understand i take it was captured and he escaped but was recaptured so while immortals men were after furiosa nuxhoult said hed keep maxs blood something like that one thing i never understood was why was max getting vision of a young girl etc etc
May 29 2015,positive,what can i say about tom hardy taking over the role of road warrior max rockantaskyamazingtop performancedid the job rightthe whole film was perfecti recommend watching this one
May 29 2015,positive,take the best part of road warrior the chase and make it a movie voila fury road
May 29 2015,positive,thank you rotten tomatoes for reminding me that your scoring system is based on statistical rather than objective weighting at time of writing it gets 98 better than gone with the wind 94  no but relentless  bludgeoning high octane madness in  high definition gets my vote as the most action orientated movie of all time go see it and let me know what you think
May 29 2015,positive,now this is what a real action movie looks like just plain awesomeness
May 29 2015,positive,great a must see for any fan of the originals or anyone new i hope you like car chases
May 29 2015,positive,superb action sequences from start to finish totally amazing styling props cars characters and vision of a postapocalyptic world all with a badder and madderthanmax charlize theron
May 29 2015,negative,visually impressive but honestly disappointing almost left half way through almost unbearably boring at points  cant believe people really like this  fast and furious levels of shallow action
May 29 2015,positive,the effects were pretty well done but other than that i thought the plot line lacked a bit for being a main character tom hardy said maybe 20 words the entire movie just wasnt what i expected
May 29 2015,positive,if you dont like action or awesomeness skip this flick
May 29 2015,positive,this was a really crazy movie crazy in a good sense driven by a fantastic original music score the storyline made sense and unlike other action movies the female furiosa excellently played by charlize theron had more lines than her male counterpart tom hardy as mad max lets not forget some great acting by nicholas hoult as nux who switches sides he has some really great facial expressions and memorable moments oh what a day what a lovely day he says as hes driving his combat vehicle full speed into battle  unlike mad max 1 2  3 which were shot only in australia this movie was also shot in namibia and cape town south africa the namib desert with its arid rolling sand dunes was a great backdrop for this movie  i wont spoil the story for you but this is a must see movie never a dull moment i wouldnt be surprised if you saw some copies of the intriguing mad max fighting vehicles at the next burning man festival aug 30  sep 7 2015 in the nevada desert after all these vehicles are a form of art as well  before you leave the theater take a look at the credits i have never seen such a massive list of credits which means they employed thousands of all kinds of people to make this great movie possible
May 29 2015,positive,awesome insane and epic movie making with hardy fast approaching greatness
May 29 2015,positive,its good to see an old property brought back and better than ever no pandering to a pg wide audience no need for a trilogy or shared universe no need in a reboot or even bothering to fit the film into existing continuity just a damn good action film i also dont get all the apologetic theres no plot though comments  there is exactly the right amount of plot for the story thats been told we dont need a prequel film for furiosa and we only need to spend 10 minutes in the immortals world to know everything we need to know about the villain the world building is hinted at and more disturbing for it well thought out action scenes love all the tricks for car piracy and a level of insanity throughout hardy seems drawn to mumbling roles hoult has the most complete arc and is endearingly and unnervingly insane and i think theron has just joined the club of established actor easily transitions into action hero i hope this makes loads of money at the box office so that other film makers throw out the cookie cutter and take a risk im almost tempted to watch happy feet if this is what the director can do
May 29 2015,positive,i was under the impression this was going to be a remake of the original it is not a remake its another chapter but without mell i liked the bare bones nitrous grit of the original a little more but theres no denying the overthetop action packed into this latest chapter it is what it is and it did it well the only real drawback for me is that at no point did i feel like i was watching mad max he was so damn forgettable as a character that it ended up being all about the ridiculously out of place breeder girls as beautiful as they werethey were the story line and the story line was equally ridiculous to the point of almost getting in the way of the action but like i said it is what it is as far as postapocalyptic action flix go this one is fueled by pure anabolic steroid and in this case thats a good thing
May 29 2015,positive,awesome way to start the summergreat plot non stop action  great acting
May 29 2015,positive,was a gripping film lots of action
May 29 2015,positive,great film  superb acting and something a bit different than most films around
May 29 2015,positive,even though my friend and i hadnt seen the original mad max trilogy neither one of us had any regrets going to see this movie its pastpaced intense and it never loses your interest its a brilliant actionpacked piece of filmmaking that actually manages to focus on character development and plot within all the nonstop action great summer action movie
May 29 2015,positive,wasnt sure i even wanted to see it i like the classic 80s version but it was surprisingly good and very entertaining
May 29 2015,positive,definitely worth watching on the big screen
May 29 2015,negative,seriously this movie is essentially a 2 hour car chase movie  i like a good action movie however i also like my action movies to include character development and a better story line than this movie could muster up   dumbfounded as to how this movie received such high accolades  i left feeling well theres 2 hours of my life ill never get back
May 29 2015,negative,an unqualified piece of shit no plot no character development couldnt wait for it to end stay away
May 29 2015,positive,this movie is the best of the year thats no joke go see this film
May 29 2015,neutral,for special effects  5 for the storyline  1 i compromised with a 212
May 29 2015,neutral,i personally didnt care for this movie i dont get why people are making a big deal at first i was like eh on the fence but the more i hear how great everyone thinks it is the more in like no its not really    some of the action was cool but it was slow in other parts and had no story line  if you want action see the avengers 1000 times better  or see tomorrowland if you want to see an enjoyable movie about the future
May 29 2015,positive,mind blowing action questionable ethics and unpredictable characters so many details in this movie that it must be seen a second time to pull in every element filming and effects were top notch and gives the feeling of being inside the action at all times this is a must see movie
May 29 2015,positive,best movie of the year so far  great story action and effects  george miller hit it out of the of the park tom hardy plays a great max and charlize theron steals the show highly recommended must see
May 29 2015,positive,this is a thrill ride  its an epic glimpse into a world of pain found in a valley of damnation  a visual adaptation of a wonderful terrible imagination  really a work of art  9810
May 29 2015,positive,first time in awhile walking out of theater with the audience and everybody blown out of their mind  epic big mad max fan now
May 29 2015,positive,ive seen this movie 3 times now going for the fourth tomorrow
May 29 2015,positive,i was not expecting this movie to be so good having charlize be the main hero instead of max was unexpected she plays a very strong woman in this movie not only savingrescuing some women from an overlord she even manages to save max and gets him to help her great movie
May 29 2015,negative,horrible waste of 2 hours tanks and truck speeding through the dessert boring boring boring
May 29 2015,negative,if you are into filling your mind with senseless violence this is you kind of movie
May 29 2015,positive,sets a completely new benchmark for the action genre
May 29 2015,positive,had to update this after many more viewings probably the best action movie ive ever seen and that is coming from a person that has t2 in his top 5 of all time
May 29 2015,positive,remakes are everywhere and there is a revelation coming when everyone will force studios and their creators to be somewhat original with an unaltered story but not yet right now we enjoy the alternative action packed possibilities of bringing life to our favorite movie characters and their new stories    there is a moment when mad max has his hand darted into his head    before an ounce of blood is shed the fan favorite interceptor is obliterated and the king of the wasteland is victimized and embarrassed by his realms mad and macabre the war boys big big mistake    fury road is hyper in its motions fury road is hot gross and sanded in its production design sharp and psychotic in its action rough and angry in its performance all these thing are catering a pure movie experience driven by the films impossibly staged action and refreshing landscape fritz langs first sciencefiction epic metropolis 1927 comes to mind when you first see the citadel the last place on earth with water and plants that is home to the terrestrial ghoul race that are what humanity once was the film has a massage about our society and the future each palepainted worker has a job kill and conquer they are ruled by immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne the worlds ecosystem is ill and dying and so are the war boys  they have illness of death and disease in their blood immorten joe is the worst of them he needs his blistered and irritated skin powdered and his face the darth vader look with a grinning grill it is these creatures that captured mad max and wrecked the interceptor they imprisoned him and used his pure blood to keep themselves alive     the whole spectrum of the original mad max films are turned up tenfold so much so it is unrecognizable much of what we knew as mad max is scrapped  except maybe the nonstop motor parade of destruction that is the buster keaton version of bloodthirsty action and the jeep wheeling crucifix in the front of the car from mad max 2 that is used by max himself you may have seen in the trailer and two or three easter eggs    while max is indisposed on the crucifixcar the war boys chased down charlize therons character furiosa who is a mechanical armed imperator she has deceived the ranks to save the immortan joes virginal wives who are in a powerful war transit furiosa is using in the explosive and stormy pursuit it is baffling how once the action starts from the first few minutes and it just does no giveup or slow down for more then four minutes     what is brilliant is mad max is like the watcher for the first 20 minutes  stapled to his chair as he watches in trapped hysteria the film go wildly insane with its action and it acts as an origin story if you have not seen mad max before    tom hardys spoton gravel portrayal of his vital role is more then half the reason why the film is so immensely great watch tom hardy is not mel gibsons mad max  mad max is tom hardy     after a highspeed chase for the ages and a funny scene where max first meets therons punked road warrior character and the perfect virginal wives max is forced to help them as he has finally gotten control of the overpoweringly badass film situation    fury road only gets near to being bad when splendid rosie huntingtonwhiteley one of the wives dies and the adrenalin infused film tries to be sappy and calm down for just a moment but it did not work at all    fury road practically remakes the final convoy fighting scene from mad max 2 as one feature length commotion that holds you at every second of the films turmoil in humanities last stand fury road is an experience there is no time to think about the story when the pure action scenes are taking you by the throat one of the best films of the year sure one of the most immense action films in the last decade spoton an immensely great film
May 29 2015,neutral,the action and stunt work was great but the lack of a halfway intelligent plot and any character development or introduction that would make me want to care about any of these characters limited my enjoyment   heres the plot of mad max fury road spoiler alert max is captured by a mutant gang and drained of blood for several hours or days who knows meanwhile a one armed charlize theron for some reason rescues 5 random australian supermodels and hides them in her truck so they can escape to apparently the only green place left after a crazy car chase through the desert max survives a wreck and being drained of blood for several hours and doesnt even need some orange juice or a cookie to be perfectly fine after our heroes meet and fight they decide to team up to escape from the bad guys another crazy car chase later with accompanying music by a punk rock guitar player with a guitar that shoots flames our heroes escape and make it to the green place only to find out wally world was closed so in order to continue the action they decided to go back and take over the villains base since it was left mostly unguarded then after all that trouble max decides to go back out into the wasteland now without his car even though there is water aplenty here   its just so dumb
May 29 2015,positive,this is better than some of the older mad max movies  however it is still just as rediculious   there  is a lot of action and it will keep you engaged   however i found myself laughing out loud at some of the scenes
May 29 2015,positive,geat action sequences coupled with amazing cinematography make for one of the best films of the last couple year
May 29 2015,positive,amazing and beautiful weirdness wrapped in nonstop actionpacked grittiness
May 29 2015,negative,where would this film be without cgi or theron bout a zero  laughed my way through it
May 29 2015,positive,visually emotionally and philosophically engaging mad max fury road is an action drama sure to remind you of everything you hate about sand and everything you love about flamethrowers
May 29 2015,positive,action packed with little to no acting
May 29 2015,positive,definitely an improvement from the original mad max movies  however this movie lacked in its plot and could have been expanded upon with more meaningful dialog
May 29 2015,positive,i would not have imagined from the rather campier earlier mad max movies that it would mature into this reboot which has now been created such a rich and brutal fictional universe the key elements as well as small tributes to the original are still very much intact but actually underneath all that inhuman visual carnage lies a very human core message that just resonates very profoundly theron is largely the soul of the story but hardy also carries the new max with a great quiet turmoil witness it
May 29 2015,positive,a really good movie since the first movie
May 29 2015,negative,in my opinion  this movie was a hot mess so much went on without much ever happening it also had a  below mediocre storyline
May 29 2015,positive,great visual effects not very good plot
May 29 2015,positive,just in case you all didnt notice mad max fury road has a 98 on rotten tomatoes go see it for serious
May 29 2015,positive,wow gotta see it again
May 29 2015,positive,i must start with overrated     this film compared to the original mad max films does not have any legs to stand on it does not follow any plot that you would consider traditional which would not be a bad thing if they did not call this movie mad max     the good    this film has perfectly depicted the thematic sights sounds atmosphere and cultures of the postapocalyptic world and brings you into it in a fast and furious way   despite the plot this film would make a great video game     additionally the film has some very good acting moments some cool action scenes and spares no expense with its props costumes carsvehicles etc    the bad    as i said in the intro this film lacks proper story or character development to make you remember the characters there are only flashes of good characters only because there were some decent actors in the film the director misused many actors in this film such as tom hardy himself with a metal mask on his face we are basically watching bane in this film for what seems to be 34 of the movie before he finally takes it off its actually shorter than that but that opening sequence feels that long     the ugly    the mad max license has been grossly misused here and was completely unnecessary     if they wanted to have a female heroine with feminine rights messages within they should have named the film fury road and allowed the film to be its own intellectual property rather than leaning on a cult classic that millions of people know and love so much     being a huge fan of the original 3 movies yes even beyond the thunderdome  master blaster runs bartertown     in conclusion there were many parts i enjoyed and will probably see the movie again but i can not allow there to be so many 5 star nearly 100 metascores out there by wellknown critics without making my own statement     please watch the movie and dont be bias      thanks    chris        they should have just called it fury road and made max into a random wanderer sidekickside character supporting role which he was throughout the film
May 29 2015,positive,throughly enjoyed this film action packed from the start
May 29 2015,positive,great high action film loved the diverse people they used from the people on the poles to the musicians on the truck plot was good  ending was ok
May 29 2015,negative,blowing up cars and shit that makes you over look the fact no one can act
May 29 2015,positive,on my list of top action movies a real accomplishment
May 29 2015,positive,the more i look back and think about this movie the better i like it really cool action and simple straight to the point plot i was looking for more dialogue and i cant give it a full 5 stars just because i dont see it academy award worthy but really creative action and really cool for 3d a viewer could be confused at the beginning as the setting is established but would eventually catch on b
May 29 2015,positive,high octane action  with a good story must see
May 29 2015,positive,better than the avengers 
May 29 2015,positive,its one long car chase movie maybe it has a moral not sure didnt care
May 29 2015,positive,will surely go down in history as one of the greatest action films of all time a week later and my adrenalines still pumping the work of a true auteur and artist and leagues away from the generic formulaic pap usually peddled by hollywood absolutely fantastic
May 29 2015,positive,from the trailers i wasnt interested in seeing this movie but the critics gave it a 98 and everyone else gave it a 91 so i figured it was probably pretty good epic proportions certainly beginning of he movie i couldnt understand what was being said the speech was garbled a lot of action some storyline but it was so long i found myself shifting uncomfortably in my seat before it was halfway over after shelling out 15 bucks i stayed through it hoping it would somehow improve i mean it wasnt terrible just a strong meh
May 29 2015,positive,a well made action movie with a primitive uninteresting plot
May 29 2015,positive,brilliant cinema science has finally caught up with millers original vision and we reap the reward of it all happening within georges creative lifetime
May 29 2015,positive,one of the best action movie of recent years
May 29 2015,positive,as a huge fan of the original franchise this one definitely exceeded the standard  theron really stole the show although hardys maxs spot on as well  take note hollywood  this is how you ought to sell women
May 29 2015,positive,i cant describe how amazing and imaginative this movie is it is simply a blast i was on the edge of my seat the entire time
May 29 2015,negative,the movie was grotesque and so laughably ridiculous i could not enjoy it the main character max had terrible lines this is my first and last mad max movie
May 29 2015,positive,mad max is typical fanfare for the feminist wave but for others a long overcrowded movie that may have added too much fighting and stunts
May 28 2015,positive,    i had not seen a mad max film before this and was curious as to how this would play out for me ok lets face it i wasnt curious about this film but cinephiles everywhere are just shoving this down peoples throats saying this is one of the best of 2015 and you know what this film deserves such hype    within the first 30 minutes there was a point where i got up and started pacing the room it is that exciting miller and the rest really brought something special i felt guilty skipping the credits because of just how immense a team it took to create such a unique environment did you see how many people were on stunts this movie did not take the easy route on the special effects and i appreciate it mad max definitely deserves the hype it gets and instantly jumps toward the top of my favorite films of the year
May 28 2015,positive,unbelievable action from start to finish this installment expands the mad max universe and provides it with gritty and intriguing new characters like the warboys and imperator furiosa its wonderful to see a film that has unapologetically strong female characters that are important to the storyline rather than there to look pretty
May 28 2015,positive,awesome just awesome
May 28 2015,positive,this is how you make an action flick  miller hasnt lost it with an amazing visual style and flair check your brain at the door
May 28 2015,positive,i didnt think i would like it but i did it does run a little long though
May 28 2015,positive,an adrenalinefueled 2hour action spectacle with a surprising amount of heart given the general lack of dialogue it breathes furious new life into a waning genre
May 28 2015,negative,no idea what movie everyone else watched but this was awful
May 28 2015,positive,finally somebody made an interesting movie thumbs up
May 28 2015,positive,a stunning action movie that manages to build a complex thoughtout world and tell a full story with barely any dialog  i really enjoyed tom hardy as max i was very excited to see melissa jaffer from farscape make an appearance really great cast all around
May 28 2015,positive,the best movie of 2015 so far
May 28 2015,positive,madmaxmovie what a lovely flick best action movie in a long time nonstop w strong performances incredible film by georgemiller 810
May 28 2015,positive,great action movie loved it was just not the same without mel gibson as max
May 28 2015,positive,a fantastic blood pumping action film the best of the decade
May 28 2015,negative,weirdest fn movie i ever seen i dont even understand what happened i feel like i should have been on some heavy hallucinogens to enjoy this piece of crap
May 28 2015,positive,i think it should have been called mad furiosa fury road  but thats kind of redundant
May 28 2015,negative,i walked out 34ths of the movie it was a complete waste of money an time this rating for this movie is appalling it should be a 2 complete trash
May 28 2015,positive,pretty good not as bloody as i would have liked but neither were the other ones loved the vehicles
May 28 2015,positive,very entertaining movie a blast
May 28 2015,positive,mad max fury road gave me what i wanted and expected from a mad max film a nonstop thrill ride everything from the stunts visuals and the bad ass monster trucks and the freaks that drove them were amazing for a beautiful woman charlize theron looks great with a buzz cut while knee deep in a gritty grimy post apocalyptic world nicholas hoults manic character adds nitro to the movie and takes it to a new level awesome movie to be enjoyed in 3d
May 28 2015,positive,bland characters  bland movie    the action is spectacular the cinematography is gorgeous    but the characters are flat that mainly is the fault of the writing but tom hardy and and charlize theron are very subdued throughout i know that mel gibson has had his problems but his electric presence would have been infinitely better than what hardy does its one of those things where it doesnt matter if max is supposed to be two decades younger than gibson is now they should have still had gibson in the lead    i just couldnt really care about any of the characters for the most part except for nicholas hoult as nux one of the main villains drivers he at least has a story to tell and it is a lot more interesting than everyone elses    there are many fun touches here and there mainly the guitar player guy whose sole assignment is to play power chords while chained to the front of a massive vehicle that is basically a mammoth speaker stack except for the main compound where the vast society lives lorded over by the villain immortan joe there is zero world building even with a budget over 10 times what thunderdome cost and over 30 times what the farsuperior road warrior cost    i was pretty much just riding out the rest of the movie by the halfway point even though george miller proves he is a much better director than whippersnappers a third his age there is just too little point in the story or in the characters to have made the effort on this worthwhile
May 28 2015,positive,this movie should not exist in 2015 but thankful it does  it brained fuced me  it is truely a masterpiece of our time  a visual feast so absurd that your eyes will not be able to look away  charlize theron was amazing in her role  tom hardy did more with a few lines than most actors do in a career   i havent left a movie talking so much about since inception  must go
May 28 2015,positive,tom hardy and charlie theron take this film by storm from the very start the acting is top notch from the entire cast the editing is phenomenal the script is awesome this is hands down my favorite movie so far in 2015
May 28 2015,positive,this movie is an amazing blend of cinematic art and the pure action of a car chase
May 28 2015,positive,boring dialogue essentially a dragged out car chase becomes a movie decent villains better than average girl hero not so good man hero 4 scantily clad babes to save and alot of killings car wrecks and nothing else
May 28 2015,positive,one of the best high speed movies ever charlize theron is amazing and  gorgeous
May 28 2015,positive,probably the craziest movie ive ever seen full of exhilarating action and some spectacular moments the movie nevertheless feels a bit underwhelming when it finishes the story or lack thereof is confusing charlize theron steals this movie from everyone else and provides a strong female character in a movie that heavily celebrates feminine empowerment not the best movie of the year some are claiming it to be but nevertheless balls to the walls action and enjoyable empty calories rating 79
May 28 2015,positive,non stop action from start to finish had me at the edge of my seat the whole time
May 28 2015,positive,probably the craziest film ive ever seen there is some spectacular and aweinspiring moments while watching the film but it doesnt add up to much and the story or lack there of is confusing enjoyable and proudly insane charlize theron steals this movie from everyone and allows the movie to be a tale of feminine empowerment rating 79
May 28 2015,positive,phenomenal  mad max fury road is visually stunning an actionpacked from start to finish charlize theron is perfect in the lead role and a great match for the new mad max if you liked road warrior you will love the film five stars
May 28 2015,positive,i really enjoyed this film  i thought it had a surprisingly good story with some strong characters and themes  i like how max was characterized with a little more emphasis on mad this time around and i enjoyed tom hardys portrayal with limited dialogue  i thought the action sequences were very well done and not overly flashy fighting style wise they were plenty flashy with explosions and crashes  i liked that the fight style was more basic and barbaric it suited the nature of the setting  i enjoyed the incredibly strong female lead furiosa portrayed wonderfully by charlize theron  she was as much of the heart and soul of the film as max was  i liked all the little throwbacks to the original three films in the franchise with maxs car the tanker truck battles the music box and aviator hat from road warrior immortan joes children vaguely resembling masterblaster from thunderdome and joe himself being played by the same actor who portrayed the main villain toecutter in the first mad max film  all in all this show was a heck of a ride
May 28 2015,positive,one of the best films i have seen in a while
May 28 2015,negative,i usually dont give absolute merit to ratings but often will believe if a movie gets a high percentage theres probably some truth to the reviews i dont actually read the reviews before seeing the movie because well i dont want to know too much going in i stand by this decision even though it really backfired here after seeing the film i went back and read the reviews because i could not believe it got the accolades it did and now i get ita lot of people said it was a better story line than fast and furious 7 and it was but ff7 was awful i actually walked out because the action just couldnt save the completely soft insipid dialogue and pan shots of serious face violin playing dramatic one liners mms plot was only slightly better i cant really criticize the dialogue too much because there wasnt any to speak of mms witticism was replaced with cave man grunts and spastic attempts at releasing himself from the continuous impossible traps and kudos to the reviewer who pointed out how much of a patriarchal evil doer was immortan if he entrusted furiosa to be his lead driver it played like a   graphic novel and that was cool the soundtrack was at times inappropriate when barry and larry were introduced the violins in the background it was funny was it supposed to be though in fact there were many really funny moments although i was the only one laughing on a plus note the costumes were genius the action was awesome the vehicles were badass and the weapons and means for war were incredibly creative the pole boys
May 28 2015,negative,had higher expectations poorly executed
May 28 2015,positive,i liked this film a lotdidnt love but i had some scriptstory issues in the beginning great performances by theron and hardy  i was really amused that the guy movie had a not so subtle feminist twist
May 28 2015,positive,fantastic and crazy movie
May 28 2015,negative,just action a wild wild action scene but thats all it is
May 28 2015,positive,great fun finally someone figured out how to reboot a franchise without attempting to retell the back story exactly what a mad max movie should be action car wrecks and blood not a movie that explores characters or plot simply put driving shooting killing and finally redemption see it in a theater
May 28 2015,negative,if you are interested in a 15 hr fight scene with a bad plot at best this is your movie
May 28 2015,negative,i regret the 16 i paid to see this long boring and dragging story i dont get it and dont get the scores of rating
May 28 2015,positive,it was entertaining and worth the ticket but i must have missed something because 98 on this site seems a little high  its more of an 8085  good effects and stunts but i totally didnt care about any of the characters at all
May 28 2015,negative,all testosterone with hardly any dialogue only decent part was the strong females of all ages who kick ass the message to not ruin the planet or else was nice but not worth the 2 hours i lost watching this train wreck avoid at all cost
May 28 2015,positive,super action from start to end  pretty wild
May 28 2015,positive,believe the hype its extraordinary
May 28 2015,positive,great movie fantastic action but managed to fit in a pretty conpelling story i was very entertained and enjoyed it
May 28 2015,positive,possibly the greatest action movie ive ever seen i just hope filmmakers will not be ripping this movie poorly off like they did with all those crappy sin city and 300 ripoffs
May 28 2015,neutral,unable to visually track mad max road furys befuddling yet stylish violence i considered its similarity to illienkos a well for the thirsty
May 28 2015,positive,wonderfully punishing to steal a buddys review of it
May 28 2015,negative,really sucked  no way these reviews are real they are paid for  scammy movie  i want my money back with interest
May 28 2015,positive,one long car chase 
May 28 2015,positive,cracking bit of action not dissimilar to mad max 2
May 28 2015,positive,mad max is back and better than ever fury road started fast and kept a nice constant pace throughout each character had time to develop and thanks to fantastic writing played an important role to the plot the camera placement was shot beautifully while the music was so good you wish itd play during the entire film george miller is back and with superb casting im definitely looking forward to the next four movies best movie i have seen in a long time
May 28 2015,positive,loved loved loved everything about this movie
May 28 2015,positive,you must see this movie this epic actionadventure opera rocks rocks rocks and charlize theron sizzles like the surface of the sun
May 28 2015,positive,i watched this on an airplane just as everyone else was leaving its probably not an ideal setting to watch this alist action movie but thats okay i jotted down notes here they are   my first mad max movie   great action movie decent drama   action was fun and extremely fastpaced sometimes to the level of not following what was happening   i did enjoy the action but for a twohour movie it could have used more variety   sprawling world of a desert which as empty as it was was easy to understand in its geography   disconnection between characters led to an aura of mystery   the cause was established in a short and sweet package dont expect anything revolutionary or elaborate   characters connect simply on grounds of not liking status quo and seeking redemption without one of our heroes tom hardy even revealing his name until near the climax   extra points for avoiding romantic mumbo jumbo in favour of developing strong female roles led by charlize theron   ultimately redemption is achieved its unclear perhaps so that sequels are justified    to round up my points in a paragraph i hesitate to hail this as one of the best action movies of all time none of the characters were memorable even in their mysterious ways neither was there a singular great action moment that still resonates in me the whole package was definitely greater than the sum of its parts and as a whole i had a good time as a drama the relationships between all of the characters with a silent agreement to fight for the same cause intrigued me most as an action movie i can see myself having an even greater time when watching this on a screen larger than my head i cannot speak for mad max fans so as a newcomer to the franchise i dig the world you are definitely still relevant george miller
May 28 2015,positive,mad max fury road is one of the best looking films ive seen in recent years and in many ways the action is fact paced thrilling and unlike anything ive seen on screen before in my life the cast is outstanding with hardy and theron leading the charge and the story is engaging the film is proudly insane from the over the top characters to the incredible stunts performed mad max is the best blockbuster of the summer
May 28 2015,positive,mad max is a spectacle perhaps the most beautiful action movie ive ever seen due to its fluid action sequences intense color juxtaposition and grandscale set pieces its story is basic to the point of brilliance the only thing you need to be concerned about is the gorgeous mayhem happening on screen
May 28 2015,positive,awesome best actoon ever
May 28 2015,positive,there is little few to say except that it is two hours of brilliantly orchestrated action
May 28 2015,positive,its not a plot lovers movie for sure those who love raw action special effects postapocalyptic films though will be in for a real thrill
May 28 2015,positive,seen it twice and really want to see it again its just the perfect action film
May 28 2015,positive,very interesting good action
May 28 2015,positive,get ready for a high octane all out no lack of action movie with mad max fury road now before you go thinking that this is just a movie for the action and effectswait this movie is pretty much about the action and effects but seriously all the action is for a purpose and underlying watching a demolition derby on screen is an interesting story that is told from furiosa who is attempting to rescue unwilling woman from basically lets call it a cult the movie might be called mad max and trust me we get plenty of madness and max but the bulk of the film centers on furiosa and her plan which involves the aid of max mad max fury road is also a much much better take on the subject of what happens when a postapocalyptic world is filled with different groups fighting over what else water and oilso remember how muddled the movie waterworld was ok ill gave you this most people its still a sore subject for kevin costner dont want to remember waterworld in any case mad max is quite an upgrade
May 28 2015,positive,im judging you if you dont see this movie in theaters
May 28 2015,positive,very good film very different but the guitar guy was very weird
May 28 2015,negative,charlize theron was the best part one never ending chase beginning was a bad acid trip story was terrible could have been so much more
May 28 2015,negative,the guitar guy was a waste a electricity
May 28 2015,positive,balls to the wall entertainment only problem was max didnt get his car back
May 28 2015,neutral,at least a whole page of dialogue  another 12 page of undesipherable dilogue costume set design make up editing etc very good in other words super korny  yet mildly entertaining
May 28 2015,positive,another movie from miller and let me say he did not let me down just imagine a movie with more action than transformers and had a better story well you got this movie if you want an exhilarating action movie with a decent plot line i highly recommend this movie
May 28 2015,positive,weird as hell but strangely fabulous and visually stunning
May 28 2015,positive,my husband and i saw it and thoroughly enjoyed it it kept us interested through the entire movie from beginning right to the end it wasnt a high level intellectually stimulating movie where you were trying to figure out the plot but visually it was interesting and the characters were unique i felt it was true to the mad max of the past and it was a great ride especially if you enjoyed the original go take a ride
May 28 2015,positive,exhilarating with cutting edge revolutionary action scenes  plot is not complexand doesnt need to be  some films need complex plots others dont  this one hits the nail on the head  great film
May 28 2015,positive,thirty years after thunder domegeorge miller is held with the mammoth task of bringing his iconic genre defining story back from the ashesand boy does he deliver12 years of work and preparation pays off in this adrenaline pumpingvisceral unapologetic intense embodiment of visual ecstasy that drives you down the depths of dirt road hell at 400 km per hour living you dazed confused nauseated and entertained  fury road is a movie that absolutely thrives in the arena of cinematographyaction sequenceart designs and sceneryi will go as far as saying miller may have just re envisioned a new way of plotting the action scenes at rapid intense pace that will shake up the movie universe for everi dont think i have seen anything like this beforeit almost combines elements of old movie making with a modern cinematic land scapei smell oscarsthe levels of inventions are high and very poetic michael bayjerry are you watchingyou could learn a thing or two about inventing new action sequences without over reliance on rehashed sloppy cgi scenery  for all the great big action sequences fury road is movie that is not without weaknessesthe character development and plot execution are a bit troubling  on face valuetom hardy seemed a perfect fit for the role of a steely cold bad ass maxbut was he a little too perfect for the role hardy suffers from what i call co star syndrome were no matter the role giventhe personality of the actor always renders him a well suited costarhardy feels like a costar in his own moviehis lack of charisma coupled with his anti social mood means personality falls away in the dark shadows of the movie leading the way for charlizetheron and nichola hoult to steal the spotlight as soul and heart of the movie  in terms of the plotunfortunately for fury roadfor all the beautiful artistic scenerythe story is exhausting and a bit flati feel it could have had a bigger edge to it  despite its shortfallsfury road artistic theme and visual imagery is were the movie hits a home run it feels like a dark comic book that is literally brought to life with grand gesturesfury road is like a symphony orchestrated by vibrant colorful characters that whisk you away from your seat into a scary hellish dystopia riddled with a surprisingly well balanced dish of male masculinity and feminist renaissance  all in allfury road is a classic tale of big bad bully vs unlikely protagonist that can be thoroughly enjoyed by the testerone fueled action junkies
May 28 2015,positive,it was a very entertaining film  i especially like the guitar player in the film
May 28 2015,positive,pointless unnecessary fucking unbelievable
May 28 2015,positive,this movie is rawgrittywasteland destruction created through the use of real noncgi effectsall the way down to the flame throwing guitar nuff said right quiet possibly the best action movie period
May 28 2015,positive,too much sound and fury signifying nothing great eye candy but hollow story and characters left me empty
May 28 2015,positive,mad max beyond beyond thunderdome  a sequel or is it its never made quite sure but its very much more of the same very much more big postapocalyptic oil tankers smashing through flaming postapocalyptic pick up trucks a la the road warrior very exciting to watch but with a plot that makes very little sense tom hardy is just there really  he doesnt do much except squint
May 28 2015,positive,this movie is and unbelievable spectacle that kicks conformity to the curb i can count on both hands and feet the number of badass moments go go now and see this if you havent already
May 28 2015,positive,after watching the movie i can say the trailer does it justice while at the same time leaving out one of the best side stories most important it works the images got stuck in my mind since seeing it before fast and furious 7 and i knew i have to watch it     youve got in this trailer the beautifully mastered start of the movie with the broken rhythm of reality for a mind lost in madness youve got the oppressive ruler who aims to bend life to his own will youve got the action pumping crazily like the flames exploding in a city set alight by a dozen of arsonists at the same time and youve got the deep dark and broken voice of the guy whose eyes see it all max the mad one no madder than the rest of the world   and there is something else which charmed me at first sight the images worked with surrealist refinement i know this is some quite pretentious language i am using right now but please believe i cannot help it  im also pondering on how much to reveal as not to spoil it all for you but to say enough of what i really want to express   after debating with myself i have decided i will not reveal anything about the very first image on screen which made me whisper to my friend ana wow it looks amazing and it wasnt a flowing summer dress a pair of gorgeous shoes or a picturesque landscape  well a landscape it was burning your retina rather than soothing it  what i will tell you is how impressed i was with the start of the movie in itself it has all it needs good timing good rhythm great vision over the jerked movements of the outside seen by a mind gone mad over the haunting fears and regrets lurking inside   a small gem in its own it sets high expectations for the rest of the movie while it gives you just enough to be satisfied from the very first steps into the story i would say it was a clever strategy from an experienced director in line with basic entertainment and not only principles give them enough to keep them interested but not too much as to overwhelm them or put it this way meet peoples expectations as much as needed not to frustrate them but go one step further and surprise them as well this makes the best scaffold for any good entertainment product for the large audience after all  in this respect george miller marks point after point with mad max fury road  i must confess that i have seen the first series a good while ago probably as a young teenager and i am not that young any longer by biological age at least so besides mel gibsons charisma some good action and a misty faint image of the postapocalyptic world in that series i cannot remember much of course i have always loved mel gibson and i can confess that the beautiful madness in his passionate eyes cannot be equalled at least by my emotional or not standards but then mad max fury road  gives you more than one great charismatic actor burning from inside out on the screen the new movie brings a truly memorable world the madness spreading through and along in such a way in which it becomes almost touchable it imprints its setting into the viewers minds with powerful and haunting images not soon to be forgotten and it does this while pumping crazy action scenes one after another   apparently it has been reported according to imdbcom that this was the directors intention beautiful settings and breathtaking action to speak for itself   i have mentioned the images so many times now that i need to give you a few examples without spoiling the story see the trailer the war rig huge oil truck escorted by a few other vehicles rolling down in a dessert landscape under a bright sky then watch the chasing party catching their tail the radioactive sand storm the young woman in bride like attire walking from the oil tank to the trucks cabin the beauty and sadness in furiosas eyes see the water flowing from a burnt huge rock to the people waiting for a drop to keep them going   and then what you dont see in the trailer is even better the night scenes engulfed in a surreal hue of blue almost glowing but still heavy like the shadows of death of all the lost souls who roam a wasted land not entirely alive but not dead yet   the way this postapocalyptic world has been designed and set into motion looks most compelling no one is spared pain or disease not even the rulers and their packs of war lords tumours blisters poisoned lungs weakened limbs are the most common things never mind the masses waiting at the foot of the high rocks they seem to exist out of inertia only due to this selfpreservation instinct that all forms of life but even more human beings with their sense of self posses   immortan joe one of the three dictatorial rules of this world decides who gets what around his citadel he gives the masses speeches and a little water every day with a voice tone and tactic reminiscent of hitler he keeps the right to breeding to himself and his own he decides for all the rest   for someone as interested as i am in society and humanity values certain scenes have a strong impact i found myself impressed at showing how a handful of peopl decide who gets to have the basic survival needs met and who doesnt immortan joe gives them words and a little water while growing lush gardens and vegetables on the top of the rocks for him and his chosen ones on whose support his power rests on somehow this is not necessarily a postapocalyptic world of the future it happens today and most people do not think of it some probably say its just the way things are we cannot do anything to change them and some even support this state of facts as they probably feel they are the chosen and entitled ones   there was another thread of the story which touched me the character appears in the trailer but you would not expect much of him nor think he actually has an important role whatsoever besides the two strong lead characters max and furiosa this guy grows a personality and his personal development is one of the most delightful parts of the whole movie  while he is still only chasing targets set for him by a choice deprived society he embodies the fanatic however there is innocence in this character throughout in a certain scene when he gets blessing from the big guy and my friend ana was somehow showing her disapproval i whispered to her actually with tears stuck in my throat give the faintest string of hope even in death to somebody who has nothing to expect in this life and youve turned them fanatic   to my delight this character has kept his innocence and supported my observations  without spoiling the action the twists and turns the dark humour and how the story grows in between the fighting scenes i can say that mad max fury road  is a movie about hope it shows what happens to people who do still have hope in a nonegotistic way as they share it with others imperator furiosa it shows how one without hope who lost a lot and who is still haunted by all the losses can go mad mad max it gives the perfect image for egotistic greedy unscrupulous people who build all their hopes and expectations on the shoulders of others and of taking whatever fits them from all it gives a touching delicate image of the ones who have just received hope and now have not only what to fight for but what to die for fighting   at some point max talks about not having hope a powerful striking statement but i will let you discover for yourselves  what this movie is not is a feminist propaganda product whoever sorry i cannot be bothered to check uttered such nonsense could possibly be a person with nothing else to say or do in order to attract more attention on themselves   strong women so now you have to be a feminist and to spread feminist propaganda whatever that is to approve women are strong and can fight for themselves need be   strong women escaping an oppressive regime please just read the newspapers and you will see over and over again examples of women standing for their human rights and against discrimination in regimes where they are mere breeders and sexual objects as well as servants for the man around them   or is it really so farfetched that in a postwar world ruled by warrior men who take all the can take and make the law with no respect to other human beings who are breeders blood banks or just cockroaches lurking at the foot of the citadel women would be treated as providers of babies and pleasure and nothing more is it now  the two main characters in this movie play their part beautifully and success depends on both of them imperator furiosa chases a dream from her childhood fights for her own when nobody cares for women other than they themselves but finds her dream shattered she cannot give up on her paradise is ready to carry on running to catch its illusory shapes max helps take the right turn his madness proves to be the needed element to change the world whilst making it collapse inside while his drive is survival and as such he finds himself alongside the fugitives at some point his perspective changes as well the hope he lost stays alive in these women and he cannot fight its bonding strength   and as men are said to tend to he comes up with a solution in the end   last but not least george miller thinking this movie as standing on its own and not a remake of his earlier works proved brilliant not a fan of remakes whatsoever i appreciate how he used a setting and a character to create something new and to emphasize on society and the way it is still heading today   as we were getting out of the cinema ana told me this was the craziest action movie shes seen in a while comparing it only to kill bill then later on back home she expressed she liked this one more than ex machina yet another production that i have to write on as i found it clever refreshing and haunting at the same time   definitely it is the movie which made me think debate and analyse the most of all i have recently seen
May 28 2015,positive,loved the visuals and the action super weird and different highly entertaining
May 28 2015,positive,overrated in my opinion but i did like the special effects explosions action and all that not much of a plot and a disappointing amount of lines and screen time for max he mostly grunted most of the time really lol furiosa seemed more of a main character than him and she was pretty badass too
May 28 2015,negative,terrible movie how many ways to kill someone while driving a vehicle beyond stupid
May 28 2015,positive,it is an amazing movie to such extend that has reshaped for ever the genre it represents it is a full blown action movie set in an isolated and deserted earth were people has gone totally crazy it avoids cliché and corny dialogues that are often present in action movie films and the actors are acting as much and as discreetly as needed for the actual demands of the movie until the end of the movie you will grasp your breath the graphics and sound effects are its strongest asset in the end it is a movie that convinces you that this could have been happening in reality somewhere and somehow at any given time i loved it even though i am not a huge fun of the action movie genre
May 28 2015,positive,i came in with no expectations and was blown away loved that the female characters werent the 1dementional im afraid of charlize theron after watching this
May 28 2015,positive,having not watched any of the original films i went in blind only knowing it was set in an apocalypse and nothing else my only complaint is that its very light on plot its essentially an escorting mission from point a to b with literally non stop action for 2 hours there is about 1015 minutes of breathing space in between the action i would like to say that tom hardy is brilliant but he is overshadowed by charlize theron and nicholas hoult they steal the show in every scene if you are an action junkie then you will be pleased to know that the majority of scenes are done with practical effects and cgi is only used when its absolutely necessary excellent film but only let down by its lack of story
May 28 2015,positive,ill just jump right on that hype wagon and say this movie is everything people say it is the first act mad max is pretty much tied to a vehicle driving at 100mph with an awesome baneesque mask on  there are also sniper assassin grandmas  bad ass villains  bad ass everything nothing wrong with this movie if there is a secret war in the action movie genre between super hero movies and everything else this just made a major move excellent concept excellent execution
May 28 2015,positive,sooooo in love with this movie
May 28 2015,positive,you want character motivations and script analysis go elsewhere this reviews a little different    mad max was never my cup of tea dont know what it is but i never got into it they were ok movies i just never really cared why did i see the new one it looked like it could be pretty good and mad max fury road is good    no its not lawrence of arabia but it is a thoroughly good movie now it has issues issues i have castigated movies for in the past whats the difference why does this movie get a pass ill tell you and no its not because its a mad max movie thats lazy and stupid a movie needs to be worth excusing the little problems beyond the genre or title thats what you call suspension of disbelief and it has little to do with its this kind of movie it boils down to three very important items so rather than an in depth review full of insider nonsense about frame rates and character motivations lets look at the three major reasons this movie works and so many others do not and maybe afterwards ill set a few angry antifeminists straight on something     1 effort  from everyone writing directing photography stunts costumeseveryone one department fails the movie as a whole can fail see stallones latest series of lazy cashins if everyone works hard except for your main actor or the effects department or the director the whole movie starts to look and feel lazy and you totally lose your audience i suppose this is why i cant stand most of the bad on purpose movies getting pumped out lately by the likes of the asylum the asylum truly does not try so many movies from them and from major studios are lazy on purpose and excused as a genre now i can get more enjoyment out of italian bflicks like yor or downright bad movies like space mutiny than i ever will out of sharknado the reason is that the former actually tried and cared what they were doing in spite of their limitations and the asylum knowing makes garbage on purpose that insults me as a viewer and its dangerous for movies as a whole    it lowers the bar for movies as a whole when bad on purpose becomes more profitable than genuinely trying here george miller made a batcrap crazy movie that reads on the page like the asylums wet dream but theres a major difference and no its not budget the original road warrior cost 400 thousand to make in 1981 adjusted for inflation thats just under a million dollars which was the budget for sharknado meanwhile road warrior is a hundred times better than sharknado so whats the difference    2 the desire to make a genuinely good movie  i know its like kicking a crippled man at this point butmichael bay transformers had a budget of 150 million fury road had a budget of 150 million both movies are huge action extravaganzas with minimalist plots and thin surface level characters why is this movie better george miller actually cares what he churns out which goes back to effort he cared more so he tried harder and so did everyone involved in this movie i suppose there may be another factor which brings us to    3 talent  george miller is a talented director he knows when to push when to pull and when to leave well enough alone he surrounds himself with talented people who work equally as hard and care about the finished project he knows his material back to front and front to back and doesnt try to force the audience to have a good time or feel something he lets the material do it for him and he just films it    and thats why this movie works    a post script on feminism in this movie and the little boys who are angry about it    firstly lets get something out of the way if youre a feminist and you excuse a movie that is otherwise terrible because of the strong female characters thats about as stupid a reason to praise an otherwise bad movie as any ive heard men women whatever good is good and crap is crap and as much as id like to see more strong female protagonists in hollywood i want them in good movies luckily  this is a good movie    meanwhile if youre a guy and youre pissed that there are so many tough ladies taking the focus off of max and youre blaming feminism and eve ensler for corrupting your precious max max movie grow up and grow a set of balls that isnt threatened by a woman with a gun that doesnt need your help eve ensler was there for one reason only to advise george miller and the actresses playing the wives on the realities of sex slavery and human trafficking its the same reason military personnel were advising the war boys expert consultation max isnt some perfect impervious warrior sometimes he needs saving even the old movies made that perfectly clear having some ladies in there kicking tail and pulling his ugly butt out of the fire was millers decision plain and simple and it was a good one want to know why    this is the freaking apocalypse man only the strong survive if you expect to see any women after the apocalypse you better get used to the idea of them being tough you think the only people who could ever hoist a rifle and throw a punch are dudes ive got a few female marines mma champs and farmgirls who want word with you and if you run youre just gonna die tired    time to grow up boys
May 28 2015,positive,terrible dialogue for tom hardy  really abysmal  no max humor or wiseass comment  great action scenes but would definitely give tom a better max persona  and must there now be a strong leading female role in every action film  this film is pcd to death
May 28 2015,negative,i would give this zero stars if i could to get this thing down from 98 so more people are not thoroughly disappointed trying to fathom how this movie is rated higher than every best picture award winner in the last 20 years no plot development character development dialogue it may be a decent movie for a very specific genre but dont go in thinking this movie is worth its 98 rating
May 28 2015,positive,a triumphant return to the reckless mayhem and guiltfree indulgence of the early 80s actionadventure bubble max puts foot to floor right from the opening bell and never lets up somehow topping itself over and over again even when it seems like theres nowhere left to go its joyous anarchy a world that thrives on all of societys dirty secrets completely postapocalyptic crazy but also a little more familiar than wed like to admit of course its a visual powerhouse  a glowing example of art direction stunt driving cinematography and character design thats damn near unrivaled in modern cinema  but its also an audio behemoth like inceptions deep bellow or terminators ominous rumble fury road can convey a looming sense of dread through its frequent effective use of bass you feel that rumble the rides starting back up again junkie xls accompanying soundtrack is a perfect tonal match the right blend of fuzzy maxedout guitar licks and incessant pounding tribal drums perhaps most impressively the film doesnt feel obligated to dig up every last bit of backstory on its way to the finish line if anything it revels in leaving that to the viewer whose imagination is bound to fill in the blanks for such a broad wildly eccentric cast of characters far better anyway its a raucous success a lethal dose of sensory overload that hits like a twohour surge of adrenaline i loved it constantly shaking my head at the experience and laughing at myself like a little kid at his first rrated movie loved every minute
May 28 2015,positive,it lost a full star cos its not a mad max movie and would have been tons better if it hadnt been sold as one  that said its a good action flick wellmade great photography 3d is sublime and well done the cars are so awesome i want all of them charlize and nicholas hoult are the leads  tom hardy never really stood a chance against them
May 28 2015,positive,an action packed thrill ride that leaves your bum tense thoroughly enjoyable havent seen the originals but makes me want to
May 28 2015,positive,i found the ending rather flat and anticlimatic but the movie was an excellent visual adventure it was just plain fun to watch all those car crashes its a mad max movie so i was willing to suspend disbelief for the number of car crashes mad max survived without any broken bones and a few other things i just went with instead of questioning overall i think it made more sense and was easier to understand than any mad max movie yet maybe i dont remember the others well enough but i believe its my favorite of the series
May 28 2015,positive,in mad max fury road immortan joehugh keaysbyrne celebrates a trading run to another town that is being led by imperator furiosacharlize theron by sharing some water with his subjects  things go well until furiosa abruptly changes course and immortan joe notices exactly who is missing from the citadel  so he sends his war boys after her  one of them nuxnicholas hoult has maxtom hardy as his blood donorhood ornament    as a movie of few wordsone of the most meaningful ones being redemption mad max fury road is an exciting superb and thrilling movie just like they dont make any more that is ruled much more by superb production design and astounding stunts than empty cgi effectsin fact this would be the kind of movie that quentin tarantino would make if he were not so very selfindulgent  overall this  provides a bleak vision of humanity at the brink and few options with an even more damaged max than previously seen  whats especially refreshing and extremely cool is how feminist this movie is which you might also have read about elsewhere
May 28 2015,positive,dont really get the hype great visuals but nothing really that outstanding in terms of plot
May 28 2015,positive,visual stunning a non stop adrenaline ride with not much story but a great popcorn flick
May 28 2015,positive,great achievement as an action movie delivers beyond what its expected simple storyline but enough to excuse whats going on really enjoyable great in 3d
May 28 2015,positive,how action movies should be awesome
May 28 2015,positive,easily one of the best movies of 2015
May 28 2015,positive,this film will clean house come oscar season guaranteed
May 28 2015,neutral,the action sequences were great the effects  awesome the only thing that blew it was the overall cheese factor of   how overly weird the bad guys were the monster trucks pole vaulting and fireworks  just wasnt what i expected   try again please
May 28 2015,positive,brilliant action and beautifully shot charlize theron is kick ass
May 27 2015,positive,saw it tuesday  very good action  entertaining
May 27 2015,positive,its been a while since ive seen a madly good car chase
May 27 2015,negative,this movie really has nothing to do with mad max  very little dialogue  way to much car chase scenes and ordinary casting      maxs character in this story is secondary weak and quite frankly not required    retitle this film mad furiosa  swap tom hardy with jack black  comedy relief  introduce more dialogue   shorten its chase scenes  and film it in australia    maybe some penguins as well      not a classic
May 27 2015,positive,mad max vs dr satan slipknot and billy corgans family
May 27 2015,positive,the longawaited revival of the mad max franchise was well worth the wait as not only is it the best of the series but its the gold standard for contemporary action films george miller reinvents his postapocalypse for a postvideogame  world but it causes for a very imaginative look thats as exhilarating as it is playful of even more import the film manages to be both a 2 hour car chase as well as an adventure movie with a good storyline dont be surprised if this machismoleaking movie gets you choked up a bit as its really damn good and likely the best popcorn movie youll see all summer
May 27 2015,positive,the most rerrifying part when immortal along with his gang chase furiousa   adding that  demon rock guitar is more scary 
May 27 2015,positive,rock opera sheet metal carmageddon 30 years later and george miller hasnt lost a beat
May 27 2015,positive,a return ticket to a continious adrenaline rush
May 27 2015,positive,its litterally two hours of adrenaline and twisted metal the perfect continuation of where the previous three films left off tom hardy become the road warrior  and litterally captures the very essence of gibsons previous max the rest of the cast really should get nods as well each portraying a diffrent charchter of the post apocalyptical australian outback
May 27 2015,positive,the guy with the guitar tho
May 27 2015,positive,wow powerful themes and  almost non stop action great use of 3d and charlize theron and tom hardy are top notch even the use of the brief moments of silence was so well done i am still recovering one of the best movies i have seen in a long time
May 27 2015,positive,this one took a little bit of stewing with me i walked in with high expectations after reading other reviews and left a tad bit underwhelmed but not because it was bad but because it was such an odd film very different from many of the other blockbusters after a day or two though it settled and i was hooked the visuals are spectacular the story was interesting the action was amazing it was just all done up so well loved it
May 27 2015,positive,its a good movie good popcorn flick but it just felt like one very loooong roller coaster ride
May 27 2015,positive,insanity on top of madness all being presented in such unabashed passion
May 27 2015,positive,one of the most subversive action films  cue guitar riff
May 27 2015,positive,allow me to begin with a confession i had to see mad max fury road again i knew minutes into the film that my appetite would not be quenched and i needed to see it again which i did less than 12 hours later a week later i saw it a third time in the theater the reason i did this is obvious in one regard  its a highly enjoyable pulsepounding amazing spectacle of firstclass stuntwork and mad genius so rarely accomplished on such a large splendid scale of destruction the other reason from a writing standpoint is that i needed to see the movie again or else my review of fury road was going to consist of nothing but an unending stream of positive adjectives vomited upon the page in excitement and for you dear reader i wanted to do better also i wanted to see mad max fury road again and i honestly wouldnt mind in the slightest seeing it again    in the postapocalyptic future immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne is an aging warlord with his own fiefdom he controls the water supply and has an army of gearhead warriors to enforce his rule his trusted driver imperator furiosa charlize theron is leading a caravan for supplies when she goes rogue driving off into the desert furiosa has taken immortan joes property namely his five wives enraged immortan joe gathers a posse of death vehicles and riders and heads off to reclaim his property max tom hardy is a drifter thrust into the middle of this conflict when hes strapped to a car and driven out into the desert part of the immortan joe rapid response forces     there are few things more exhilarating in the realm of motion pictures than a wellexecuted welldeveloped action sequence and mad max fury road is a blistering aweinspiring masterpiece of brilliant carnage what director george miller has achieved onscreen is visionary the level of execution is so rarely seen at such a large scale and with so many moving parts that i was delighted and curious how something this extraordinary could escape the riskaverse studio system im trying my best to restrain myself from sheer hyperbole but this is an instant classic in the world of action cinema and a definite top five alltime action film for those keeping track i would say last years raid sequel would also qualify for that status the movie provided me a font of joy that did not let up until the end credits ushered me out of the theater the action sequences are epic in their scale with dozens of different vehicles in hot pursuit and yet miller brilliantly orients his audience to every moment of his symphony of demolition there are so many different parts to the action but the audience knows everything that happens the sheer sense of momentum and pacing is overwhelming and giddy the action sequences develop organically with new consequences throwing our characters into different and dire directions theres also a startling amount of variety with the action sequences fury road has been described as a twohour chase film and thats accurate to a degree but there are breaks in between the sequences small moments to catch your breath and learn more about our characters and their hostile world each sequence is different enough that the action doesnt ever feel redundant even when the third act literally requires the characters to backtrack the adrenaline just doesnt turn off from the getgo and miller keeps throwing out new tricks new stunts and new cars to astound and amaze simply put fury road shames other american film releases     the stuntwork is another facet that just raises the bar when it comes to action movies miller emphasized practical effects whenever possible and the emphasis pay off with a heightened sense of realism onscreen its real cars being smashed to real bits real stuntmen being tossed around in an age of cgi over saturation its all too easy to become numb to big screen spectacle because of how hollow it all comes across visually just this past month with the avengers sequel i knew that all the fight scenes were mostly cgi or actors against green screens and it eases off the enjoyment of the moment dont even get me started on the deluge of cgi carnage in the last hobbit film real physical objects and physical interaction offer so much more believability in an age of increasing disbelief with special effects with millers focus on practical effects first and foremost it brings that sense of crazy excitement back and it ensures that fury road will hold up better over time     i also appreciated just how much thought miller and his team put into crafting their world every detail feels like it adds to the overall richness of millers vision the designs of the cars the use of scrap the fact that a pulley system is operated with children running up giant wheels it all contributes to making the world better realized and more alive the level of thought put into weird and deadly concepts in this movie is fantastic once the main characters pass through a bog of land we see people dressed in cloaks traversing the land on stilts and its little passing details such as this that make the movie feel more complete i enjoyed that one of maxs heroic attributes is that hes specified for his blood type being o the universal donor the fact that miller finds a satisfying way to bring this attribute back as a payoff is also appreciated i also enjoyed how miller expands upon the family of immortan joe with his bevy of freakish sons and brothers and peculiarities i enjoyed the fact that miller isnt afraid to embrace the weird of his dystopia symbolized best by a blind guitar player attached to a roaming wall of speakers who can shoot flames out of his instrument every time the movie cut back to this guitar playing pace setter i smiled and i smiled a lot during this movie    some have grumbled that max is a supporting player in a movie that bears his name but i would argue he is a colead and the real star is rightfully imperator furiosa max is not replaced with furiosa rather they have an interdependant relationship where theyre both vulnerable and they both come to trust the other but without a romantic mingling these are both wounded shaken mistrusting and volatile people and to watch their shared sense of teamwork and the gradual opening and reliance upon one another it is itself an affecting and emotionally satisfying relationship but back to furiosa its really her story because she is the one with the personal connection o the mission max has always kind of been a wandering warrior who finds himself in other peoples battles consider him a postapocalyptic man with no name furiosa is the leader who has planned and implemented the escape from immortan joe and its she that deserves our attention i enjoyed the fact that miller doesnt even have to explain her past we know shes suffered trauma physical and likely sexual and he assumes the audience does not need furiosas past abuse spelled out specifically for them or seen in grisly flashback shes a strong woman who is far from helpless with one arm this is a story about women liberating themselves from sexual slavery under a corrupt patriarchy more on the thematic relevance below theron is our leader and the ferocity in her eyes is all you need to know you believe that this woman will do whatever it takes for freedom    the other aspect thats very clear is that fury road is a decidedly feminist film but it never stoops to preaching or even directly calling attention to its efforts its a ruined world where men with unchecked power have exploited the vulnerable where women are treated as property and valued for breeding purposes our heroes are by and large women who have rejected their roles in this society or are fleeing their impositions and with furiosa as lead it paints a more than convincing picture of women being just as capable and badass in the postapocalypse i want to go as furiosa for halloween its a movie that portrays women struggling against an unjust system that devalues them but fury road doesnt wallow in their suffering it doesnt have to in order to get its points across it also treats the wives in a manner that lacks sexualization immortan joe has treated them as property but miller treats them as human beings even going as far as to give them distinguished personalities im not saying they approach threedimensional characters but theyre certainly not just eye candy theres a sequence where they wash each other with a hose and you could see the myriad ways this moment would go tawdry for some cheap titillation what the mens rights activists sadly this is actually a thing seem to have lost in their caterwauling is that feminism is not a zerosum game one person gaining stature and opportunity does not mean its taken away from another just because furiosa is strong it doesnt make max weak furiosa being a compelling lead character does not diminish max it makes him an even better character because he recognizes her value and his own limitations like a scene where he voluntarily hands over a rifle because he knows shes the better marksman no one has to explicitly point and say girls can do it too    theres also a fascinating commentary on the danger of religious fundamentalism with the war boys these powderwhite young men are immortan joes armed forces and they are promised a swift appearance at the gates of their paradise if they die in battle witness me is their exclamation before sacrifice they spray paint their faces chrome eternal shiny and chrome and then go in for the kamikaze kill again the theme is ripe and obvious but without requiring characters to comment nux nicholas hoult wonderfully deranged and then sincere actually has the closest thing to a character arc going from hopeful martyr to independent thinker he begins as a clumsy yet determined antagonist and becomes a resourceful and unexpected ally     this is practically a flawless film on a technical level the cinematography by john seale cold mountain is bright with lush colors that pop on the big screen weve been treated to far too many color degraded films so its nice to view a movie that wants to use all the colors at its disposal the musical score by junkie xl 300 rise of an empire is stirring and pulsepounding with its heavy percussion but theres a languid melody that returns again and again that is emotionally resonant its surprising how the score will punctuate the bombast and wailing guitars with a lovely string arrangement like when we rush into the sandstorm and a car is blown into the sky the editing is outstanding by margaret sixel happy feet and she keeps the audience informed with every new twist and turn and with so many moving parts and changing dynamics that is a miracle itself the production design by colin gibson beautifully expands and informs this strange world there isnt a department in fury road that wasnt at the top of their game    if i had to quibble i could accept the argument that mad max fury road lacks the substance to be much more than an exhilarating action ride the dialogue can be a bit onthenose hardy mumbles through a majority of his miniscule lines and the characters arent as fleshed out as they could be and the plot is rather bare bones however i view its narrative economy as a virtue as there isnt a moment or scene wasted in telling this breakneck tour de force of postapocalyptic demolition rarely does an artist get to work at this level in the studio system let alone succeed with a final product that still manages to be strange mordant uncompromising and completely riveting this is a nearperfect action movie and a thrilling highwire act of practical filmmaking bravado mad max fury road is the standard i am going to judge all summer movies by for the rest of the year and i imagine many will be found wanting i could continue to heap praise on the movie but the most persuasive stance i can make is that if you fail to see fury road on the big screen you will always regret this decision i am a disciple of fury road and witness my brethren and me this movie was made for the biggest screen the loudest sound system and an endless bucket of popcorn     nates grade a
May 27 2015,negative,this movie is absolute garbage feminist propaganda at its finest the mayor of town is robbed by furiosa she steals his guzzaline and kidnaps his unborn child after furisoa was entrusted with transporting his guzzaline the mayor of this post apocalyptic town is a bad leader but the story does not cover enough on him to show he is evil just that he is a bad leader the mayor of the town has young and elderly people in his care and they seem to be doing fine and he even entrust furiosa with transporting his goods so the mayor has trust in women furisoa then steals the gas kidnaps the unborn child all the while mad max is no where to be seen he is only a mere hood ornament in this feminist unreal apocalyptic world the movie has almost nothing to do with mad max this movie is about furisoa and her crimes this movie mad max fury road is really really really bad i hope tom hardy gives a public apology after he has ruined the mad max image for all men any person saying other wise is too afraid to admit it this movie sucks
May 27 2015,positive,the whole time i felt like i was watching a twisted metal variant movie  the rockstar semi ruined the movie for me  bring back thunderdome 
May 27 2015,positive,this movie rocked simple story the focus was the nonstop action
May 27 2015,positive,oh what a day what a lovely day
May 27 2015,positive,ive never seen a mad max so im not a fan and subsequently didnt like it as much im just not into the genre as much but they did a good job with it i liked it but it wasnt my kind of thing
May 27 2015,positive,after watching a wellacted and wellwritten film that uses practical effects so well i feel like i never want to watch a movie with cgi again its always a nice surprise when a movie that from the trailers looks awesome but cheesy comes out on top on every level
May 27 2015,positive,this movie for me did not live up to its high ratings there was not enough of a plot and backstory  i would have liked a few more slow scenes with dialogue if you want fast action with chase scenes then this is for you
May 27 2015,negative,utter nonsense not the nonstop exciting action the critics claimed it was hokey and minimal story ridiculously implausible action scenes and concepts
May 27 2015,positive,awesome start to finish this movie killed it i would have preferred more dialogue and a little more back round information connecting the entire series together regardless this movie still gets 5 stars from me enjoy this hell ride
May 27 2015,positive,could be the most fun i ever had watching a movie  it exceeded expectations
May 27 2015,positive,i saw it n monday evening and i cant stop thinking about it its a gleefully over the top western in the vein of stagecoach its wacky races on acid its a smart feminist take on a genre usually filled with mindless macho swagger its put together with such panache and a very definite love of the action movie this is the movie george miller probably wanted to make years ago but didnt have the money to do so it was stuck in development hell for a long time but it was definitely woorth the wait see it on the biggest screen you can find
May 27 2015,positive,weird but camp an institution if you like living in an institution plenty of action trump got in and pressed the button we could be in a mad max world   85 on the ricksta scale
May 27 2015,positive,not really my typical type of movie really kinda messed up but well done
May 27 2015,positive,this film was a complete surprise i loved every minute of it from the trailer i thought this file was all action and no substance boy was i wrong this is a must see
May 27 2015,positive,it was better the second time i saw it
May 27 2015,positive,that was a lot of fun
May 27 2015,positive,visually astonishing an incredible ride through the wastelands that barely ever lets up  george miller doesnt get caught up in the modern movie culture aside from the blisteringly incredible special effects that is but max is what he has always been  a man of few words  when he speaks it is important  the ladies carry the dialogue and further the story and he doesnt show up as the savior or the one man they turn to for help  this distinction is important because to have it any other way than how it was done would have caused muting of the female characters and their arcs  the film has been described as one long chase scene and its hard to argue that  the action is furious  mad even  and millers creations of vehicular craziness replace the technological weaponry of other films with breathtaking ease  nicholas hoult is easy to overlook mostly because hes all white and bald but his character nux goes through the most substantial arc of any of the characters to get to where he is by the end  it will blow you away not with great wit or tearful monologues but with action that allows its characters to use sheer force of will to dominate the screen and demand your attention  max is back and with a vengeance
May 27 2015,positive,i was hyped to see this movie but i left disappointed paper thin plot evil overlordbrainless minion tropes  i give it three stars for the glorious spectacle
May 27 2015,positive,very much enjoyed this one  it doesnt stop  lots of action  lots of impressive stunts  minimum detectable cgi  really enjoyed it
May 27 2015,positive,it has story 3 movies this is just fun to enjoy the subtle and grotesque ways to survive the road
May 27 2015,positive,pure awesomeness max as a sidekick female heroine crazy stunts 2hour long car chase yes please
May 27 2015,positive,for all the action i actually became bored with the movie towards the end
May 27 2015,positive,the visuals and production of this film are incredibly imaginative the action sequences are different and fun and while the story isnt great it also isnt like many other movies out there this films uniqueness sets itself apart from your typical summer action flick
May 27 2015,negative,mad max    dont believe the reviews not the critics not your best friend     i dont know who bribed whom or who sold their soul to the devil but this movie is one of the worst movies i have seen jay and silent bob is gone with the wind comparably     this movie is the most ridiculous stories and scripts     somehow in a post apocalyptic world where the older folks can remember the earth before it became a wasteland in other words 40  50 years post cataclysmic event the population of earth has devolved into societies like nothing ever conceived on earth not the indians of the great plains in 1850 not the romans not feudal times even the ancient egyptians and the chinese dynasties of old are light years ahead in societal devolution that the people of world a la max       the evil overlord there is no explanation of how  he came to be in charge and why everyone has turned into complete morons but one in complete unison with the next how did this society of dipshi7s become so organized and orderly in their utter retardedness    ive seen monkeys and dolphins on the discovery channel act more human than the people of this world     movie begins with the society sending charlize theron headed out to get gasoline because oil is more precious than even virtually the non existent water apparently no one told the douche bags the earth is 45ths water     but she is going out to get one truckload which easily would have been expended 4 times over with the vehicle activity during the remainder of the movie     here are some of the dumber points    the bad guy in the company of max and charlize somehow switches sides halfway through the movie with absolutely to explanation or reasoning  one minute he is a mindless robot believer in his masters cause the next minute hes like ill help the other guys like if it were so easy to sway the followersdisciples of the evil skeletor leader how has he kept his people in line in their fervent and fanatical fashion for so long    why does charlizes truck with two gas v8 engines sound like a cummins diesel    they have both gas and diesel    toward the middle of the movie charlizes truck blows an engine she asks the restard turn cloak if he can fix it he says yes he grabs a 78 end wrench crawls underthrough the truck and somehow repairs the engine with one wrench and no parts in about the time an indy crew changes tires    mad max bain from the last batman movie recreates the bain character although his breathing machine is worn by the bad guy  he adds nothing to the film does not really advance the story     when the cars need extra speed  power the morons climb onto the engine and blow wth their mouths  gasoline directly into the air intake     lastly in a world where they have virtually nothing no resources why would they have a vehicle completely dedicated to multiple giant tomtom drums and drummers    and a separate vehicle with some electric fuel fire breathing guitar and musician     dont waste your time
May 27 2015,negative,this was basically one long chase scene designed to show us once more how great or crazy australian stunt people are there was minimal storyline and tom hardy didnt show me any of the character that the original mad max showed mel gibsons portrayal showed how max actually cared about the world he was fighting through
May 27 2015,positive,absolutely crazy movie this one special effects pretty much mindblowing and there is very little to criticise character wise the plot is a little thin but at the same time fairly streamlined and the only thing i might have wanted more of was an idea of the society in this film what its like to live at the citadel and that would arguably strengthen your connection to furiosa and the wives kick ass flick though for sure
May 27 2015,positive,theron and hardy offer no frills nor fluff but the real stars are director george miller and his glorious team of technicians through perfectly controlled yet gleefully chaotic movement fire metal and feminist rage they craft the best action film of the decade
May 27 2015,positive,action packedwith great visuals its a good time
May 27 2015,positive,the plot is waferthin but thats mostly made up for in highoctane action and sexy sexy postapocalyptic cars
May 27 2015,positive,it was amazing instead of relying on clunky exposition and statements the storyline is shown rather then told the characters feel believable and in a strange way relatable everyone should go see this movie
May 27 2015,negative,while the choice of actoractresses were great the movie left me really disappointed it was nowhere near as good as the first mm movie i know this is a continuation in the series and not meant to be just like the original one but this was just a repeat throughout the movie i was wishing i could leave an hour into the movie but i stayed hoping it would have an epic ending it did not it was a waste of time and money  hard for me to say as someone that absolutely adores tom hardy lol
May 27 2015,positive,very interesting visually but the story is pretty awful  at the end of the day they didnt make me care about any of the characters or any of their actions
May 27 2015,positive,fantastic watch action packed edge of your seat movie that leaves you wanting more tom hardys raw portrayal of max accompanied by george millers stunning directing with the help of some thrilling cg makes this movie a definite watch highly recommended
May 27 2015,positive,radically well shot acted edited and just downright fun to watch
May 27 2015,positive,guitar guy stole the show he and furiosa
May 27 2015,negative,dumbest and sickest show ive watched in a while if not for the comedy relief of the guitar guy i probably would have walked out stunts were as cool as they were hilarious as were the cars if you cant help yourself wait for it on rental
May 27 2015,positive,oh what a moviewhat a lovely movie
May 27 2015,positive,this movie is a roller coaster ride that doesnt end  you will be hard pressed to find better car action sequences than what is in this movie  absolutely mind blowing stunts  this movie must have cost a fortune given the sets cars costumes etc  amazing production  however the story line was a disappointment     if not for that this would have been a home run  i give 2 12 stars for the story and 5 stars for the action scenes
May 27 2015,positive,what a mad movie  true cinema entertainment not for everyone  and thats a good thing
May 27 2015,negative,found it really boring and fell asleep half way through didnt understand the whkle point of the film
May 27 2015,positive,thin on plot big on grotesque
May 27 2015,negative,the director had to be mentally challenged to do a movie like this is sooooo bad
May 27 2015,positive,loved the non stop action great movie
May 27 2015,negative,worst movie i have seen in a long time  nothing good to say about it  how it ever received such high reviews i will never know  wow
May 27 2015,negative,wow what movie did everyone else watch  i found this movie to be boring stupid and slow moving  it was the worlds worst round trip journey  it may have been visually pleasant to watch but how can that compensate for a story that made absolutely no sense  max is mad because he had to watch this steaming pile
May 27 2015,positive,amazing action the whole time strong female leads and they arent just there for the male 5 star movie definitely movie of the year so far
May 27 2015,negative,not even some decent action can save this mess of a movie to begin the action that it does have is completely undermined by the overstylized directing  george miller decided to speed up the frame rate which created an effect more similar to the three stooges rather than anything close to exhilarating   in addition much of the movie is silly beyond words  this might not be a problem except for the fact that i dont feel like the creators of the film were in on the joke  the overall plot and the action of individual characters made very little sense at times and at the end of the day i really didnt care what happened in the movie
May 27 2015,negative,im not sure why this movie gets such high marks
May 27 2015,positive,very good  lots of action
May 27 2015,negative,loved the original mad max and loved road warrior didnt leave the theater until i sat through it again thunderdome not so much hated this one just so bad on so many levels such an ugly movie reaching for shock value but really just shockingly bad flimsy characters no real plot to speak of gratuitously gruesome violence no pacing whatsoever just nonstop driving and shooting absolute mystery to me why such high ratings here i would rate it a 1 out of a 100
May 27 2015,positive,utterly mad but i couldnt take my eyes off it makes fast  furious look like the teletubbies
May 27 2015,positive,spectacular the most beautiful storytelling ive seen in years so organic no lame exposition short concise dialogue no crappy love story beautiful cinematography and production design this is real filmmaking not at all surprised it has a 98 positive feedback on rotten tomatoes cant wait to watch again female empowerment always wins me over
May 27 2015,negative,worst movie ever made we see most everything that come out this is my first review i would rather watch ishtar 10 times in a row than ever see this film again what was charlise theron thinking  dont waste your time or money not worth even one star
May 27 2015,positive,apparently it takes an old veteran like george miller to show this new generation of young filmmakers how action can be exhilarating and so he gives us this highoctane adrenalinefueled roller coaster of a movie that is technically flawless visually astonishing and looks amazing in 3d
May 27 2015,negative,i spent two hours listening to a dialogue that consisted of nothing but people screaming at each other and nonstop explosions dont get me wrong i like a good action flick as much as the next guy but this movie made absolutely no fucking sense     how it has a 91 fan rating is beyond me but if fireballs and unintelligible yelling is all it takes to entertain people these days then im seriously worried about the state of our society i have never seen a movie so dumbed down it was unwatchable    if this piece of shit wins any awards im going to shoot myself in the face
May 27 2015,positive,this film epitomizes what a grindhouse b style movie can be if given a big budget there is no pretense so if you took the family based on reviewswell you should have done your homework its not for everyone although it was largely one extended chase scene it was so fully realized that you could fill volumes inside furiosas rig each vehicle was an environment unto itself miller didnt spoonfeed you a plot either which is what most are used to these days with modern films the story was there but you had to take it in visually and fill it the gaps yourself this movie is also hilarious both in its excess and its subtlety ive never laughed so hard at a thumbsup i havent enjoyed a movie this much in years
May 27 2015,positive,it was a good 2hour action venture
May 27 2015,positive,by far the best of the mad max series of movies  tom hardy is good but charlize theron as furioso steals the show  great action movie good story tremendously executed
May 27 2015,negative,action soup but weak plot with tons of holes  ive seen every mad max and this was a poor remake
May 27 2015,positive,the best advertisement for seatbelts ive ever seen
May 27 2015,positive,it was awesome i gave it a 910
May 27 2015,positive,i dont understand action movies so i think i was searching a little too hard for the plot during mad max fury road it had me on the edge of my seat for much of the movie but there was a lot of material left to be desired that electric guitar player though
May 27 2015,positive,neither more nor less of what i expected thanks to george miller for keeping the aesthetic of the previous entries in the series thats something i really appreciate highly recommendable
May 27 2015,positive,ever since i saw the trailer for mad max fury road ive been excited to see it but the funny thing is i hadnt seen the previous movies and thats the great thing about this movie you dont need to mad max fury road is exactly what the title suggests this guy max rockatansky tom hardy whom is not of sound mind is forced to survive in this post apocalyptic world but he isnt the only one as he is quickly ambushed and taken to be used as a blood bag by a creature called nux nicholas hoult i got the impression that most of these people have become a little nuts which is best summed up by max himself as the world fell it was hard to know who was more crazy me or everyone else    taking into consideration this movie is an out and out action flick the plot isnt great but its tolerable for what this movie is but its the women who grab this movie by the balls lead by imperator furiosa charlize theron whose plan to free a harem of imprisoned women from the clutches of immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne and once joe realises something is wrong he sends an army of these loosecannon nutjobs who view immortan joe as a god in pursuit of his property    accelerated maybe by recent action franchises fast  furious marvel universe mad max fury road has had an adrenaline shot to the heart or some shiny metallic spray paint this movie is relentless im not kidding from start to finishes it is purefast paced action and i loved it i mean i havent seen a film with such intensity since the raid and thats no easy task i believe we have the father of the mad max franchise george miller to thank for this    george miller has done a truly outstanding job in creating mad max and has directed every single movie nurturing and developing this chaotic world a special mention needs to be said for the visual effects also theres this one scene where theyre all driving through the desert and they drive right into a huge desert tornado and it was just amazing to see    met all my expectations and i will now be watching the previous films
May 27 2015,negative,big mistake twisted stupid gross moronic oh  and all those people catching water in shallow pansreally theyd be dead
May 27 2015,positive,fucking amazing the sort of film that makes you want to swear when you talk about it
May 27 2015,positive,a great movie with even greater stunts this is in my opinion the best movie by far this year if you havent seen it then you must make time for this movie
May 27 2015,positive,all around great movie  has a well done flow through the entire movie i would see it again for sure
May 27 2015,positive,this movie was 2 hours of action with very little dialogue which the movie didnt need for character development or to drive the plot forward  i was not at all disappointed
May 27 2015,negative,a straight wtf movie the whole time good on action but the plot was just fuck shit up
May 27 2015,positive,best action movie ever i loved everything about it
May 27 2015,positive,remakes are often refreshing for nostalgic experiences and yet i went to see this movie before watching the original mad max films after watching all four of them i can give my opinion on this one it takes every good aspects of the original movies and improves them esepcially the action sequence of the road warrior the action is very well choreographed to where its easy to follow the chaos and that alone tells the story perfectly this is for sure the best action movie ive watched in a long time
May 27 2015,negative,probably should have stuck with my initial low expectations of the movie then i wouldnt have been so disappointed after hearing the high praise for weeks it turns out to be another generic loud cgi infested i dont care what they say theres a ton of cgi in it summer actionadventure the only thing mad max about it is the name and some of the characters accents
May 27 2015,positive,when you go to a movie you want to be entertained when you go see mad max fury road you are not only entertained you leave feeling exhausted from start to finish this movie grabs you and pulls you into the action the characters stand on their own but mesh together even better theres no need for pithy dialogue or funny one liners like the 80s and 90s action flicks there is no need to see the previous mad max movies prior to seeing this im happy the george miller was able to make a movie in this time period where movie making allows him to excel out of 2 hours of film there is about 15 min of downtime it also brings in probably the best portrayal of a postapocalyptic world that ive seen in a film tom hardy embodies the crazy and charlize theron brings in an amazing badass woman portrayal to me this movie is perfect
May 27 2015,positive,one of the wildest movies you will see this year if not in the last 5 years a fitting addition to the mad max series that easily stands on its own as an independent film from the original franchise yet leaves just enough of the original that you appreciate the roots of the film
May 27 2015,positive,solidly the best movie of the year so far its amazing what practical effects and real story telling can accomplish why use words when a flaming guitar can say it all
May 27 2015,positive,so intense felt like someones gripping my balls throughout the film
May 27 2015,positive,i usually hate action movies but this one was great this is the best movie of the summer
May 27 2015,negative,this movie was horrible i liked the originals but this one doesnt even give you a story its just mindless fighting shooting and driving the post apocaliptic world looked great but where was the story
May 27 2015,negative,a boring two hour car chase
May 27 2015,positive,big laud and epic storyline is very simple yet movie is totally satisfying
May 27 2015,positive,i went into this know what mad max was about but i have never seen the past three after watching 10 minutes i wished i had the movie didnt shine to much light on just max it hit every note note and some nothing is forced or maybe i just really liked the movie
May 27 2015,positive,definitely goes back to the roots of road warrior   just awesome action sequences
May 27 2015,positive,one word describes the beginning to the very end  intense
May 27 2015,positive,very glad i went to see this  furiosa is one badass mother fucker i love her
May 27 2015,positive,impressive actionit will melt ur face offone hell of a ride
May 27 2015,positive,mad max fury road is an exhilarating and thrilling action film where its action sequences are filmed with exquisite camerawork and impressive stunts that allows viewers to intrigued and engaged with them plus its screenplay manages to provide an intelligently and creatively designed dystopia universe while showcasing acting performances that convey multidimensional characters that capture the plots intensity while occasionally showing hidden heartfelt perspectives
May 27 2015,positive,dont know why the fuss around this movie the story is stupid and for a movie named after him max was nothing more than a sidekick everyone else overshadowed him positives some memorable quotes witness me mediocre are just a couple i might say when driving now music is good action scenes are not bad for the gamers in us this movie is kinda like ids rage
May 27 2015,positive,this movie was fcking amazingly awesome
May 27 2015,positive,the only thing wrong with this movie is that there is no way max would still be alive past the first minute of the movie
May 27 2015,neutral,post apocalyptic world where the survivors are focused on finding fertile land to boil it down in a sentence the  whole movie is just a series of car crashes this movie was an apocalypse of its own and ultimately just too weird for me
May 27 2015,negative,cant they come up with some new ideas we are stuck in the redo mode or some crap
May 27 2015,positive,i would dare to say that its the best action movie of the last 10 years every aspect of this movie makes the experience unforgettable
May 27 2015,positive,my name is max  my world is fire and blood    the world is a dark and dreary place and resources are in short supply  immortan joe is a ruthless leader and slave owner that rules over his land with his many wives  one of his slaves imperator furiosa who is supposed to drive one of his gas tankers to gastown uses this job as an opportunity to rescue the slave wives and take them to the green land where she is originally from  she runs into another escaping slave max and the two join forces in their escape attempt    i live  i die  i live again    george miller director of mad max mad max road warrior mad max beyond thunderdome the witches of eastwick lorenzos oil happy feet and happy feet 2 delivers mad max fury road  the storyline for this picture is very well executed and does a great job of delivering the character and the universe  the action and settings are perfectly done and the makeup and costumes were spot on  the acting is marvelous and the cast includes tom hardy charlize theron nicholas hoult zoe kravitz and hugh keaysbyrne    remember me    we saw this at the drivein last weekend and i thought it was awesome  i thought it was cool how they jumped right into the story and it felt a little like the thunderdome plot  there is a lot of room to deliver a prequel or continued adventure in the current max universe  this was a well done film that hopefully turns into a trilogy    i am the one that runs from both the living and the dead    grade a
May 27 2015,positive,plenty of action a sort of new movie in my eyes not prequel or sequel not much dialogue for anyone some moments of brilliance
May 27 2015,positive,must see on the big screen in 3d amazing
May 27 2015,positive,bringing the spectacle back to australian films the vision of this hyperealistic film works very nicely the physical performances and the action pieces make thrilling but there were a few tender moments to break up all the chaos although not much on character development it was enough and all in all this film is to entertain and it did that 100
May 27 2015,negative,to put it simply this is not a mad max movie but rather just a thin story with an impressive car chase in the desert borrowing the franchise title    george miller for some reason has removed all of maxs humor wit and cleverness which made the previous three films great in addition to making the title character a sidekick in his own movie while both charlize and tom are great actors the seriousness of this story bares no resemblance to the original story line    while the cinematography in this film is impressive it is for the most part unnecessary and over done as a fellow australian george im sad to say this movie was kind of disappointing even if it was a visual masterpiece
May 27 2015,neutral,hmmobviously thrilling a car race in the desert with a bunch of mad people will definitely make it quite entertaining tom hardy is so handsome in this film well without the crazy mask on of course
May 27 2015,positive,witness me  its a beautiful day
May 27 2015,positive,asskicking asskickery from the first minute to the last this movie knows what it wants to be and it does it it is a pure action film 100 steam punk 100 of the way it was the most fun ive had at a movie in years
May 27 2015,negative,some great action scenes but i thought it was pretty boring and repetitive
May 27 2015,positive,honestly theres nothing i can really say that was dissatisfactory the concept of the film was quite unique obviously based off the 1980s film and the cast was perfectly picked the main female star shined the brightest in my opinion and i would be curious to see her in hopefully new upcoming roles  the one thing i loved the most about the film was its art style usually youd expect a movie solely based in the desert to lack color but they decided to do the opposite and by increasing the contrast it also increased the intensity of the overall film which i would say is a definite plus surprisingly for a film solely based on a long car chase there was not a dull moment it was enjoyable from start to finish although this was a fantastic movie i would not recommend this to younger audiences for it was gory and violent but i dont have much more to say if you have a chance to see this film please do itll make a great addition to my collection once its released on bluray
May 27 2015,positive,high speed tightly packed action with guitar revving in the foreground and you had me at hello the movie looks straight out of a graphic novel and with complete artistic license it could have been overboard but was well managed theron is good and so is hoult in some ways so is bane oops well not really but its the high speed motorcade sequences that steal your breadth away along with the thumping sound job well done
May 27 2015,positive,one of the best action films of all time  not only is it brilliantly acted and directed but it brings a great amount of intellectualism and sophistication to the scifiaction genre  the action is amazing the story is amazing and the political and moral messages are incredibly smart  go see mad max fury road  i cant wait to see the sequel
May 27 2015,negative,not as good as the original not at all good special effects but the story to this movie is wack and it sucks
May 27 2015,negative,did not get the movie at all i usually enjoy weird but this movie was beyond weird
May 27 2015,negative,seeing the other reviews of this movie i had high expectations but in reality the the impressive part of the film is the actionography  and set the characters are ill developed the plot is weak the dialog is lacking  the original movie blows this away    as a secondary character max helps the actual lead character  played by theron by grunting  brute vigor  and mostly ridiculous luck through a 2 hour car chase  basically to end up where they started i will not remember this movie in 6 months unlike the original which i remember after 3 decades
May 27 2015,negative,must have missed something it was dreadful
May 26 2015,positive,amazing loved every minute
May 26 2015,positive,packed to the gills with action vibrant poetry in motion and a powerful statement in unexpected feminist cinema nicholas hoult delivers the best performance of his blockbuster career mad max is certainly the film to beat in 2015
May 26 2015,negative,when i saw the trailers last year i nearly peed my pants and then i witnessed a years worth of anticipation get flushed down the toilet watching basically the longest thinnest plot lines drive from a to b to a in all be it a most artistic fashion  the imagination was glorious but i need substance to complete the celluloid experience i want meat on a beautiful skeleton  this movie receiving the high acclaim makes me feel lonely and suspicious of all future movie reviews good or bad  im generally on board with most critics but when im in such a lonely camp it makes me wonder if we see movies now just for a spectacle and not the story  this is basically the first two movies remixed into a dub step like cacophony without any smooth lulling rhythm to make you care for anyone  the movie tries earnestly like a precocious child to show you how successful it is at providing depth and meaning but translated into 15 sec close ups articulating something that the movie hadnt patience or depth to understand  i feel betrayed this was supposed to be an homage to the filth which followed the first two films in our timein my time  one thing is for certain this one will join beyond thunderdome into the thunderdumpster
May 26 2015,negative,this plot was so dry nothing is explained in this movie what was the point of his stupid visions they happened so often and then just stopped
May 26 2015,positive,mad max fury road is such a unique heartpounding visual thrill that youll need to catch your breath when its done george miller delivers a perfect action film that blends artistry with roadrage in this postappocolyptic feature mad max tom hardy and imperator furiosa charlize theron highjack a war rig to take five prized young women to salvation a piece of green land in the middle of a desert wasteland only they are being followed by a band of ghostly dieselinjected attackers bent on revenge fury road doesnt under deliver on its name there are explosions races and twists to keep the audience on the edge of the theater seats still the mad max part is what sticks with the viewer as george miller has created a disturbingly wonderful glimpse into the maddening reality of raw human nature in the most extreme circumstances
May 26 2015,positive,one of the best action movie i have seen in years
May 26 2015,positive,really good movie as story action and special effects however however  one thing i dont understand if there is the end of the world why will be the only one kind of looking people there and they all speak british accent 
May 26 2015,positive,best action movie i have seen in ages
May 26 2015,positive,i watched the recent remake of total recall with that in mind i was afraid to see mad max of course different directors blah blah blah but remakes have not been great recently after watching this new version of mad max i was extremely impressed  stayed on track with original
May 26 2015,positive,this movie was fully a crazy movie and full of actiongone fully crazy thought that even i was also riding on that road
May 26 2015,positive,awesome action but storyline couldve been better
May 26 2015,positive,oh what a lovely day    single handedly the greatest display of vehicular mayhem ever to grace my eyes no build up no beginning just ready set go 100 climax would watch again in a heartbeat    i give borderlands the movie 5000 dragons out of 5
May 26 2015,positive,bit dissapointed very entertaining lots of amazing action but some lame and cliche parts
May 26 2015,positive,better than fast and the furious in terms of overall action and storyline
May 26 2015,positive,i never thought it would be possible but i actually feel cooler after seeing this it has all the makings of a perfect action film nice rides wild violence and a clear good vs evil story
May 26 2015,positive,mad max fury road is a whole lot of bonkers  with roughly 5 minutes of development fury road climaxes for and hour and a half complete with score that never lets up this isnt a film with a story arc or character development or even an attempt at either no mad max fury road starts revving the engines and when it hits the gas pedal it doesnt let up  this may not be for everyone but for those wanting a little action and post apocalyptic mayhem its right up their alley the 3d is actually quite good for a film of this nature i was surprised at how effective it was considering most the film takes place in open desert areas   oh and flammin guitar guy is flippin awesome
May 26 2015,positive,it was a good movie crazy but good
May 26 2015,positive,no one will confuse mad max with bergman but those movies are certainly fun there is nothing like post apocalyptic australain marauders trying to destroy everyone and everything in sight     this new iteration is a complete mess a great mess the dialogue well there is none the movie might have a total of 10 minutes of people actually speaking there is however plenty of driving some great violence and a fair amount of anarchy not to mention the most hilarious post apocalyptic guitarist in the history of absurdity     i really dont know what the movie was all about since the plot is also mia however i do remember some hot women barely dressed but with some hot piercings also lets not forget the killer grandmas    the only thing missing in this movie is some actual violence there could be so much more if robert rodriguez had directed this the blood and guts would have been magical    overall a great show
May 26 2015,positive,greatest action movie of all time holy fuck non stop beginning to end action action beautiful action     i will absolutely see this movie again in theatre holy fuck omg
May 26 2015,positive,best action pic of the year amazing
May 26 2015,negative,this movie is great if you like explosions and halfnaked women there was not much of a plot to it it wasnt the worst i have ever seen but it was pretty close
May 26 2015,positive,this is one i need to see again i was impressed by the kick ass women in the story if women were in charge
May 26 2015,positive,absolutely brilliant   miller recycled some of his best and most iconic moments from the original series with 30 years of thought on how to improve them and weave them into a socially conscious and responsible story whats better is that he keeps his developing mythology fairly simple giving himself the opportunity to get creative in the details rather than do the current studio practice of overblowing and exaggerating the action as a smokescreen to cover up their muddled story see avengers ultron and any other comicinspired movie i can comfortably compare fury road to movies like crouching tiger hidden dragon movies that are less about razzledazzle and just letting the story convince the audience about the world theyre watching   it is a pleasure to see how miller loves his characters and mythological world rather than the superficial artifice of cgi and overblown grandeur of the james cameronmichael baygeorge lucastypes these guys should be bowing to miller these days and take lessons from him where the star wars prequels the transformers series all the marvel films and avatar failed miller succeeds he makes a socially relevant film in a mythological universe without being preachy he doesnt try to hit anyone over the head with rightwrong or believe his audiences are idiots he doesnt pander to the lowest common denominator and instead believes that strong simple visuals can and should tell the story   i cant count how many of his frames looked like paintings how rich the colors and tones were and how he relished in showing the various textures this is a prime example of a storyteller who absolutely loves loves loves his universe and wants the audience to love it too but doesnt try too hard to be loved by everyone  for everything brilliant about this film the only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is some disagreement i have about the beats in the storyrhythm in other words there are some moments and characters that i think are significant  enough which dont get enough attention but in millers defense it seems he chose to emphasize his social interest rather than these other things and cest la vie directors choice artistic liberty  in my opinion the sophistication and very conscious and deliberate decisionmaking by miller has not been seen by any director in a long time and fury road escalates him into sergio leone caliber whereas directors like tarantino are leonewannabes miller proves himself the real deal and full of substance with this movie and it is with great anticipation i look forward to seeing how he develops this mythological world and introduce us to new characters   fury road shows a new possibility for future action movies i hope other directors and studio execs who are dumber than dirt take note
May 26 2015,positive,one of the most spectacular things ever put on film triumphant and satisfying in every way
May 26 2015,positive,if i could give it ten stars it would not be enough greatest character in film ever is the guitarist i need a shirt with him in it
May 26 2015,negative,i dont get the accolades the only good thing about it was charlize theron the talented tom hardy was wasted on a dimensionless character
May 26 2015,positive,amazing movie must watch
May 26 2015,positive,what an unbelievable movie
May 26 2015,positive,quite frankly this movie is pure madness  its ridiculously fast paced and beautifully shot but somehow it doesnt quite do it for me  perhaps the dialogue is not as strong as some may suggest
May 26 2015,positive,great creative film however i couldnt enjoy it  it went full throttle on the action in the first 10 minutes and from there the significance of the action scenes declined
May 26 2015,positive,it invites comparison to the road warrior since fury road is essentially a remake 30 years later with higher technology  after having watched both road warrior is superior is every way  1  the story line shows humans that have not succumbed to the horror and still feel shocked at the limits of barbarism in fr no one is shocked or surprised the action and plot is over the top  but very well done  2 rw  the actions moves non stop but a few relevant pit stops that adds to the story  3 better acting yes big names dont help much as i hate to say gibson does a stoic job joined by a no name crew that delivers music score  i dont where some of the fr music came from the score during the credits was supurb but the score by brian may in rw was absolutely on point and intense the entire time  rw has the advantage of being one of original apocalyptic films that has been followed by countless zombie movies and other fare  it is also an important movie that is unfortunately more believable in showing the downward progression of human society  fr is a very good film and a great action movie by all means go see it  road warrior is an important film that miller cannot replicate which is no knock on him  sometimes you do get it right the first time
May 26 2015,positive,this will go down as one of my favorite movies ever truly epic ive never seen a movie like this before
May 26 2015,positive,best movie i have seen in a long time man its like what but good
May 26 2015,negative,its great to see a movie when the main character max is little more than a side character matt hardy can not be blamed for this as his protrail of max is rather good if u remove him from the story it would be practicality the same the only major part in this film for him is his plan to go back to the citadel possibly the best scene in the movie is not shown when max goes to fend of the bullet farm but all we are shown is the aftermath
May 26 2015,positive,pretty darn good didnt think it would be because mel gibson wasnt in it
May 26 2015,positive,you surrre must be fun at parties if you think this movie is shit sarcasm  anyways this movie is fucking badass crazy and insane yet deep and powerful
May 26 2015,positive,i go to the movies to be not merely to be entertained or to think about pressing issues but wanting to see sights that ive never seen before or thought possible watching this film provides me with one such pleasure after a drought of banality  an insane masked heavymetal guitarman in overalls strung up in a tricked out speaker truck with kodo drummers booming away behind him the guitar doubling as a flamethrower i couldnt put my finger on that scene apart that it was an amazing moment i couldnt believe was actually filmed such as the rest of the film    george millers mad max fury road is a relentlessly ferocious and bonkers monster of an action film full of sound and fury and yet signifying something  the arrival of a new action masterpiece a soupedup 2hour heavy metal cirquedusoliel demolition derby on a wagnerian scale this weird and wacky beast snaps crackles and explodes from minute 0 to the credits assaulting the adrenalized senses in ways only michael bay can daydream of this is in my opinion one of the very best films of the year and dare i say it the first great action picture of the century    the film arrives in the midst of a pg13 action film hegemony where with no disrespect to fans of these movies superheros fly about destroying cgi enemies supercharged sports cars fly through cged skyscrapers nubilelooking young adults weild weapons like veterans spies get beat down in jittery camerawork and addediting and every hero mopes and sulks in doom and gloom to the point of being immortalised as a modern day cliche ol dr george has arrived in the nick of time when rrated popcorn fare were beginning to buzz again the surprise successes of american sniper and kingsman the secret service and he decides to give one hell of a remedy by flipping off every single one of those aforementioned filmmaking cliches redefining the action textbook with his own trademark brand of mayhem and subsequently outdoing himself in the process this isnt a this is how its done kids its a now lets see you do better it encourages and will influence future and current filmmakers to step up their game in the action arena it is a defining generation film and miller proves once again that large scale action sequences in a big budget film can yes be a genuine art form    you know the drill you know the man millers cult franchise heralded by action fans and established critics alike roger ebert loved the underrated beyond thunderdome is a quintessential action franchise marking the beginning of a decade and a half of calibre redblooded action films lethal weapon terminator rambo die hard once the matrix spiderman and the bourne identity  showed up audiences were anamored with the cg technology youthful storytelling and quickcut shaky cam techniques of the trio and dominated the next decade and a half the classic action trope reduced to bmovie cliche granted there have been a lot of good even great ones the dark knight united 93 from the current period but most of them took themselves very seriously damaging the urgentness of the action at stakes which the movies of past decade so expertly executed    miller himself took a hiatus from mad max and the action genre overall after the third outing following the death of his close friend and max coproducer byron kennedy which is perfectly reasonable in between then and now 30 years miller shifted towards family friendly fare creating babe and happy feet both to a considerable skill of success it is a testament to millers mad scientist oeuvre that he managed to conjure up both these juvenile films and mad max    or rather not the thing is with mad max movies one can sense millers childish exuberance in every frame of the film be it a quieter moment with a camp survivor or during a trademark chase sequences there is no time for emotional contemplating when you have insane goons on your trail and truck ill give you that ebert once said that immaturity should be something to be cherished not thrown away because it reminds us to always be simpler and happier in life as we were in our childhood miller at the young age of 70 apparently has embraced that to its fullest here  the result is a live action comic bookcartoon bursting with color and energy in every frame disguised as a real film by a true auteur at the top of his game and more importantly having a huge blast with it    not that there isnt a plot given all the action and mayhem afoot sure in an undisclosed time period in apocalyptic australia where civilisation probably went up in flames max once again finds himself in the middle of a war between the cult leader immortan joe and imperator furiosa who aims to rescue joes prized breeding wives away from the tyrant as usual max does his thing thats pretty much it most filmmakers excuse such a simple story as clichã cd and daft and thus find a way to pad it out with serious character moments and more drama to make it grounded in reality miller not only goes it traditional again he embraces it and exemplifies the basic sensibilities of silent films in the spirit of buster keaton and charles chaplin  pure unadulterated entertainment even touching up some moments with the unusual miller quirks that make his films stand out from the crowd the shoestring plot serves as a chain of action sequences linked to one another  all of them insanely awesome  for lack of a better description not since t2 has there ever been a truly relentless truly thrilling action film and i mean that in all honesty there are stakes and there are consequences and they are all shown through action    and what of our hero max last we saw of him he was played by mel gibson with cool confidence and stoic machismo now he is played by tom hardy perhaps the most talented actor of his generation and he adds a new sense of unhinged bouts of insanity to the stoicism unusual but reasonable given what the character has gone through in the past a recent controversy is that maxs screen time is reduced in favour of charlize theron as imperator furiosa with feminists celebrating and mens rights activists crying foul over the oneupmanship of their icon over an unknown female character well theyre both right and wrong max is still the centre force of the movie with his presence ensuring that furiosa survives her ordeal but furiosa portrayed by theron in one of her most compelling performances is something else  she is a fierce warrior nearly as unhinged as max relentless in her goal and showing the scars to do so its a great action heroine role up there with ellen ripley and sarah connor  a strong female protagonist that doesnt give off feminist vibes for the sake of it which seems to be the marketing draw for most movies nowadays special mentions to a captivating nicholas hoult as a misguided war boy and hugh keaysbyrne returning from the first mad max as the devilishly cartoonish immortan joe relishing in every scenery chewing moment    millers handling of the sensational action sequences outdoes even the road warrior with a frenzy of amazing stunt sequences and action choreography by guy norris piled up atop another  each outdoing the last unlike modern filmmakers who decide shaking the camera and shredding it makes it look cool and edgy miller editor margaret sixel and veteran cinematographer john seale wants the audience to savour each and every drop of the anarchy in its all of its big bold beautifully spectacular glory the use of cgi in movies is unavoidable today but unlike marvel michael bay and recent peter jackson fare miller doesnt phone it in and uses cgi sparingly and crucially when it needs be  rather than being the action it enhances and compliments it without ever being distracting its also refreshing to see practical on screen stunts and effects return centre stage and with such aplomb the academy might consider new categories for stunt choreography for the upcoming oscars the result is a perfect marriage of action and stunt choreography cgi practical effects editing cinematography and sound in a cacophony of action brilliance that will leave one dazzled and in awe seale in particular has created a gorgeous visually lavish look for the film which starkly contrasts the clichã cd washed out look of most modern postapocalyptic films proving him to be one of the most gifted modern day dps    the action sequences are a spectacle by itself but the film is also a triumph by itself in its artistic direction miller simply does not rehash what his previous and other genre films have done he costume and production designers jenny beaven and colin gibson art directors shira hockman and jacinta leong and cowriter brendan mccarthy who worked on the concept art with miller a decade prior have taken great pains to create this wholesome universe that lives and breathes on its own lungs every frame is alive with life every costume every set every insane vehicle looks very particular in detail and perfectly belonging in a world gone insane you can smell the burning rubber and fuming guzzoline whenever that v8 engine revs up and roars even the music score by junkie xl roars a thunderously apocalyptic vibe that sends goosebumps down the skin especially so when it is heard during the chase scenes     i love this film and it takes a lot for me to admit such a phrase but if you dont like the prior mad max movies or whatever i just described you might not enjoy this one or might i would rank this a slight notch below the road warrior which remains the best of the franchise but thats akin to debating whether the terminator or t2 is the better movie theyre both cracking stuff    the point isnt for me to convince others that this is a great film that would be condescending of me and its up to them to decide not me the point is that a film like this with moments that cannot be described and simply must be seen to be believed does not come around often and just the sheer scale and magnitude deserves to be savoured on the big screen at least once in your lifetime and in my humble opinion this is a movie miracle just when i thought the game was up and there were too many pg13 copycats through the industry machine my batteries get recharged and hope reignited george miller you mad magnificent rockstar bastard i thank you for this special gift to cinephiles better late than never
May 26 2015,positive,easily one of the greatest action films this year blows age of ultron out of the way mad max fury road is crazy and eccentric yet never ceases to excite
May 26 2015,positive,it was hard to get into for the first 1520 minutes because the world of the movie is so totally bizarre and grim i was starting to think i was going to hate it and then it won me over it just gets better and better and better    its almost an art film charlize therons furiosa is so totally badass and basically carries the film i started loving it when i gave up trying to rationalize anything that was happening its so incredibly inventive with the action and the car chases it feels like a postapocalyptic cirque du soleil movie on steroids a few side characters in the film seem totally grotesque and abstract but eventually i stopped asking why and start thinking why not what i really appreciated was that however outrageous the stunts were they still felt real think of indiana jones hanging onto that truck in raiders instead of the video game physics we see in other modern action films    i cant say its for everybody because it really is out there but damn it if wasnt a fun ride you just want to blow something up afterwards
May 26 2015,positive,this is the reason summer movies can be awesome
May 26 2015,positive,superb an instant classic best action movie in years
May 26 2015,positive,it was good but it didnt challenge  my imagination  or require  and brain activity at all i live the movie but felt like it missed something
May 26 2015,positive,great action scenes and a lot of feel from the mel gibson movies
May 26 2015,positive,it was alright nothing extraordinary
May 26 2015,positive,fucking amazing love me a hero who dont say much
May 26 2015,positive,its probably the best movie of the summer and maybe one of my favorite movies ever the whole movie was made with the effort to use as little as cgi as possible and the benefits that they reaped were magnificent i could go on but id rather suggest to just go see the movie gooooo gtfoooooo
May 26 2015,positive,a badass movie thats it
May 26 2015,positive,brilliantly fast paced and visual once on the road  you are in for a ride
May 26 2015,neutral,he wasnt as mad as i thought he would be
May 26 2015,positive,amazing lavish spectacle of a mustsee movie and if the scene of max washing himself in breast milk doesnt revive the flagging fortunes of helene cixous i hope it does nothing will
May 26 2015,positive,perfect in every way the visuals are so stunning they bring me to tears the acting is phenomenal the music is just heartbreakingly spectacular the direction and editing is so well done and perfect for this type of film this movie brings me to my knees as i shout in fits of joy
May 26 2015,positive,i used to think they couldnt make action movies like this anymore i was wrong
May 26 2015,positive,prepare to have your eyeballs punched right in their faces
May 26 2015,negative,a truly horrible movie i want two hours of my life back
May 26 2015,positive,its not a feminist movie its just not not a stupid movie
May 26 2015,positive,i cannot believe how intense this movie was   i am going to buy this on bluray for sure
May 26 2015,positive,truly amazing if youve seen the old mad max movies thumbs up for the actors it was a rollercoaster of emotions a movie that deserves to be watched over and over again
May 26 2015,negative,so furious 7 is 81 and this max max is as good as max max 2 i think the end of the world is close
May 26 2015,positive,i havent seen a movie twice in theaters in 20 years amazing
May 26 2015,positive,when i went to the cinema to see this film i had pretty high expectations for it and by the time then film had finished i was blown away by a truly spectacular cinematic experience this was one of those films that i knew would be an awesome ride from beginning to end and youll know it right from the start while there may be a few things i could nitpick about the story it is very engaging and with all the highoctane vehicular action youll always be on the edge of your seat wondering if the main characters will make it alive and if they do youll feel incredibly relieved i know thats how i felt the characters have a surprising amount of depth and the performances are loud and proud with the possible exception of mad max this films version of max doesnt really talk much but he develops significantly as character he goes from being a tortured body and soul to being an incredibly selfconfident hero whose actions speak louder than words the visuals were outstanding and although im aware that this is a cgiladen action film this is one of those films where the special effects work to the benefit of the cinematic experience rather than detracting from it the cars the costumes and the environment all looked like they were done to perfection in that they reflected the gloriously crazy overthetop nature of the film although nothing hammers the point home quite like a flamespewing guitar the overall atmosphere is very intense to the point that its contagious it keeps your eyes to the screen and it really got my heart pounding of course this film would not be complete with the action and let it be known that this is debatably the most intense and explosive chase film ever to grace the silver screen with relentless action scenes that you simply have to see to believe and no description will ever do it justice with all sincerity i can say that this is perhaps the best film of the decade it sets out to define itself as more than just a good action film in fact with the way the characters are depicted and the films excellent handling of the timeless themes of survival and tyranny id say that this film is the definitive postmodern action film and one that i feel will set the standard for future films in the genre
May 26 2015,neutral,i was really excited to see this as i am a big fan of the earlier movies  but for all the hype about mad max fury road i found it to be a disappointment unlike the previous mad max movies they spent little time with character and background story development they plop you into the setting then nonstop action for 2 hours sure there were lots of cool vehicles great costumes stunts and special effects but for me that doesnt make for the thin story telling and lack of character development     if youre a fan of the original movies seriously dont bother  if you just want to see crazy stunts vehicles and costumes and basically a 2 hour car chase then youll probably enjoy it
May 26 2015,neutral,mindless earsplitting violence from start to finish what plot there was and it was very very thin was predictable as one who loved the original mad max films back in the day this was incredibly disappointing even the so called feminist viewpoint was just serving the violence tom hardy was totally wasted as max he had what 30 words or so for the entire film at least charlene had some good moments
May 26 2015,positive,mad is the word its a great throwback of a film mental cars raced mentally just crazy action and fun
May 26 2015,positive,98 of critics liked it according to rotten tomatoes when i saw it  it was good but i was expecting more
May 26 2015,positive,best action film in years
May 26 2015,positive,an overthetop apocaliptic rush straight into hell no dialogue needed as nobody understands what anybody else wants basically everything hurts and everybody is badass visually stunning and interesting overall
May 26 2015,positive,adrenaline rush almost to the point of exhaustion but all in all engaging not sure about charlize theron in this role physically she was spot on but her voice was just too clear and calm and almost flat to suit her rugged postapocalyptic character it was a bit of a disconnect    but a wild ride of a movie nonetheless
May 26 2015,positive,high action packedctheron is so talented
May 26 2015,positive,i cant trust people who didnt like this movie
May 26 2015,positive,very fun action sequences are insanely awesome
May 26 2015,positive,i was very pleased to finally give this one a spin after missing it theatrically but holy moses did all the hype pay off this one starts off at a frenetic pace and keeps it going for most of the two hour running time barely giving the audience a chance to catch its breath    this is great energetic storytelling and a worthy successor to the original material    recommended
May 26 2015,positive,theres a lot of mad lots and lots of mad a little bit of max and plenty of mothers overall a big long desert chase movie that didnt quite hit expectations   mostly gratuitous many of the scenes are pure spectacle with little to distinguish from one chase and crash to the next  however any film that features a flame breathing guitar gimp strapped to the front of a monster truck certainly deserves a watch even if youll leave thinking theres a lot of unexplained gaps during the madness
May 26 2015,positive,a superb action movie with great direction and excellent music
May 26 2015,positive,rating 92100 or 92    despite being born 18 years after the release of the original mad max and 16 years after the release of the sequel i think i can review this movie     mad max fury road was everything i expected when i watched the trailer 64 or so times and more when watching the trailer i presumed the film was going to be a 2 hour dramatic and violentexplosive chase that is exactly what it was     now lets list some pros and cons     pros    the entire movie    keaysbyrne as immortan joe hoult as nux theron as imperator furiosa     the unbelievable special effects    the unbelievable total picture of the film beautiful     cons     lack of screen timedevelopment for immortan joe      confusion     george miller did a superb job of crafting mad max fury road i felt very shallow putting a cons list on this movie but it is just the way i review the movie was beautiful if it is possible to say that about a post apocalyptic chaser film then this movie deserves the award of beautiful the film is edgy sharp and all around fantastic the way that tom hardy does not have a line for the first forty minutes genius the way the film does not really have a set up genius it starts and goes to the end in one 2hour barrage of crazed action     watching the trailer i could not contain my excitement to see immortan joe he seemed like one of the coolest bad ass villains of the decade immortan joe is a dictator and ruler of all due to his ownership over basic needs such as water and gasoline in the beginning of the movie he releases water from a man made dispenser high into a structure where he and his brothers can scout above in an overview he grumbles my friends do not become addicted to water what a bad ass does he not even drink water    as the movie continued i kept wanting more of immortan joe he was there and he was pretty bad ass but it just felt like he wasnt in it enough this is a spoilerfree review so i cannot express my feelings of the ending and the antics that took place in the 2nd half of the movie    i saw the film during a friday matinee with a friend oddly we were the only two in the theater i mean yeah it was at 430 pm but come on anyways there were at least 3 times when i turned to my friend who has also never seen a mad max film and asked do you have any clue what is going on he always responded with a chuckle and nah there were a couple moments when nux and other war boys were spraying chrome spray all over their mouths spoiler oops rictus erectus joes brother yelling i had a baby brother and he was perfect i had a baby brother and he was perfect in every way after someone who hasnt been in the movie previously had a great time cutting into angharad joes heavily pregnant wife which was just run over by joe accidentally mortally wounding her and the child i assume that a lot of these moments that i did not understand were in the old mad max movies if this is the case this is totally on me and i need to watch the old movies before watching a new one if not what the hell was going on    in the end mad max fury road was one of the best movies i have ever seen great performances by everyone     ps slit was made out to be a bad ass character in the trailer wanted more out of him
May 26 2015,positive,youll clench youll squirm youll grit your teeth but in the end youll find yourself roaring with pleasure amongst the war machines of millers fury road over and over again
May 26 2015,positive,try watch it in atmos sound system  the sound will blow your head 3d no 3d in 3d movie screenplay one letter page effects wow its movie perfect for big boys who never grow up oww nicholas hoult make this movie great
May 26 2015,positive,honestly wtf all of the elements of awesome were there and they f it up   spoilers      number one gripe all others gripes could to some degree be overlooked but this one grip makes the other gripes worse you have a dude suspended from a vehicle with his flamethrowing guitarbase playing some mean riffs and that isnt even what you use for the whole soundtrack 90 of the soundtrack was terrible except for the scenes where we got to see and hear guitar psycho doing his job they held it back way too much were supposed to hate and fear immortal joe not his army of zealots one of them even gives up     his mates and his king once he realized he had been duped but still wtf why not metal throughout the whole movie it was like going to the gym and listening to enya during your workout so many movies have this problem and i just cant get into them because of the music this movie was the worst of them because they kept teasing the metal and didnt deliver
May 26 2015,positive,batshit insane and i mean that in the most complimentary way
May 26 2015,positive,a totally refreshing experience  mad max fury road is an action film that for me came out of nowhere  attention to detail is shown in every frame and you can certainly tell that the entire crew was on board for the creation of this film  overthetop and utterly satisfying action sequences will have you gripping the edge of your seat and screaming at the screen in front you while a surprisingly strong narrative will give you unexpected emotions  the characters are fascinating the world is thoughtfully and creatively pieced together to perfection and im left wanting more  cant wait for the game
May 26 2015,negative,worst picture ive ever seen maybe for 815 year olds
May 26 2015,positive,really good movie keeps you on your toes
May 26 2015,negative,if you enjoy a plot in a movie this isnt the film for you  the most plot you get is go from point a to point b and back to point a  its a 2 hour action scene  all of the dialogue could have been covered in about 20 pages of a script not that you would understand any of the dialogue since it is all screamed or spoken from behind a mask  this is all style without substance  sure there is an incredible style here and there was a lot of work put into making it look amazing but the style was more important that than the story  why would these people who barely have food or medicine have guitars that shoot fire  well it looks cool so who cares  why does charlize theron rub axel grease on her head  it looks cool  all that matters in this movie is that it looks cool  and it does so i guess it succeeded in its goal
May 26 2015,positive,great action great stunts great continuation of the original series  some back story would have helped fill in the gaps but the film still works well as a stand alone action flick
May 26 2015,negative,the fact that this movie has such high user reviews stuns me critics reviews dont normally align with that of the users because critics have unrealistic expectations so i dont pay much attention to them the score given by the users and critics alike show me that all people want out of a movie is mindless action and violence and dont like to be presented with a storyline that actually makes you think the movie itself  had really good action sequences but there was really no context or a solid storyline and left you feeling confused and dissatisfied if you have no knowledge about the original mad max series
May 26 2015,positive,transformers done right
May 26 2015,neutral,visually stunning nothing else of worth
May 26 2015,negative,wow wow wow is right reading some of these positive reviews makes me wonder wtf these other reviewers were watching  are they just industrymartin shills  granted if you like and hour and 50 minutes of chase scenes explosions and furious unrealistic fighting in on under and around speeding vehicles then you will looooove this movie  thats it in a nutshell watch a trailer and you get the gist save your money
May 26 2015,positive,if you want actionwell you absolutely have it  it is a movie of a grand scalewhen it comes to the action the setting and really the characters  the stunt work is absolutely amazing and tom hardy rocks  i love charlize theron as furiosa as she displays a calm edge about her that is impossible not to like  the main villian is also very interesting as he has many different slaves in the post apocolyptic world  there was a little heart and plot thrown into all of the madness that helped level out the madness and bring you more in touch with the characters which i thought was essential  i didnt find it on the level of ghost protocol but a worthy action movie nonetheless that will truly keep you on the edge of your seat  its set pieces are so unique it takes your mind for a wild thrill ride
May 26 2015,positive,this was an amazing film george miller is a true visionary finally a filmmaker that truly knows how to film action the story of this film is not the strong point infect i would say the story is almost non existent but you may not even notice the action is that good please make more mad max george miller
May 26 2015,positive,best action movie in the last decade no exaggeration   first badass female lead on par to ripley in alien without any ridiculous clichés  best chase scenes youll have seen the sand of awesomeness will get in all of your crevices and make you itch for a rewatch
May 26 2015,negative,conned by the hype again these big budget summer movies really do suck balls only recent exceptions being the apes movies and edge of tomorrow
May 26 2015,positive,for all the hype mad max more like meh max hehehehehehehehehe
May 26 2015,negative,for a fourteen year old boy this movie is great beyond that its pretty boring and not for any adult with half a brain   booooring
May 26 2015,positive,my name is max    what really got me was the silent scream all the symbolism in this movie reflects a probable future which has not happened yet but the evidence proves it will we have already met the day where society is undermined by a higher power and yet we still let this occur the message in this movie is one that everyone should watch the action in this movie is creative but occassions redundant the acting in this movie is absolutely superb i would have enjoyed some more max but ill suffice with the few words he gave to the audience this movie is subtly for feminism which is very important and portrays an escape from the expected heros journey overall it is what a true thriller movie should be about not just blood and gore but also logical meaning as well
May 26 2015,positive,the best action thriller after a long long time
May 26 2015,positive,was expecting something different what i saw was not what i was expecting and i loved it 
May 26 2015,negative,if i could give it a zero i would
May 26 2015,positive,if you like fast action with a little bit of scifi this movie is perfect for you i am into girly drama films and still loved this movie which is the complete opposite i say its a much was on 3d
May 26 2015,positive,after this movie ended i realised that there isnt a strong story that backs up the movie its like something that is going round and round itself i enjoyed watching it for the first time frankly because of the action thats packed into it but will i watch it again yes indeed
May 26 2015,positive,its like the game borderlands that was inspired by the original went on to inspire this remake
May 26 2015,negative,barely watchable  i read the reviews and i want to see that movie  this movie was terrible  first movie i have wanted to walk out of in years  i am shocked by the reviews
May 26 2015,negative,this actionfest is a visual treat for about 10 minutes and then hits the repeat button over and over and over and over and over again the plot is nonexistent and the writing dreadful  did it really take three people to get max to grunt for the first half of the film at times i felt sorry for the actors attempting to do their best with what little they were given but none of them quite right for the part theron lacks heft hardy lacks hart and everyone else is a thin cartoon character while the visuals are lush and glorious and the camera work superb the editing is amateurish and breaks the atmosphere frankly one of the worst movies of the year i have no idea how the rating is so high maybe i was in the wrong theatre
May 26 2015,negative,2 hours and 40 ill never get back what a piece of crap  pure violence porn  what does it say about our society that this movie is so popular  nothing good
May 26 2015,positive,would not have gone if the mens rights freaks hadnt been carrying on about it but cant imagine what their problem was it was definitely not a feminist propaganda movie  lol rollicking good action flick though loved it on the edge of my seat
May 26 2015,positive,turn your brain off and just watch  amazing special effects and fantastic story telling
May 26 2015,positive,total masterpiece by miller really recommend this title to anyone the performances stunts scenery story and pretty much everything is well on point although it needed a bit more dialogue from hardy
May 26 2015,positive,not only the best film i have seen this year but also in my lifetime mad max fury road is even better than the road warrior which is considered the best of the old trilogy it is a multilayered action spectacle that has few quiet moments immense energy and a very inclusive cast of characters mad max is amazing and is even the best 3d movie i have seen which im not a fan of 3d at all
May 26 2015,positive,this movie blew my mind things only seem to slow down twice and that was a needed intermission between all the edgeofyourseat action i cant wait to buy this movie
May 26 2015,positive,amazingly badass enough said
May 26 2015,negative,oerrated and overdone tripe  negligible story sublimated to endless battle scenes  the film is less than allegorical but does not pass suspension of disbelief  this one has great ratings but i felt like walking out and definitely should have  i cant see any redemption here
May 26 2015,positive,fight club goodfellas the dark knight mad max fury road district 9 top 5 movies all time
May 26 2015,negative,loved road warrior and thunderdome  hated this  i dont understand all the other reviewers i kept waiting for mad max to actually speak  mad max was really just a supporting part  the whole movie was just a two hour ridiculous and violent car chase
May 26 2015,negative,this movie is just nonsense violence and a chase scene that wouldnt have lasted 10 minutes with all of the explosions all the vehicles had to endure through
May 26 2015,positive,3d in avx was horrible at some spots
May 26 2015,negative,the action was epic  unfortunately the movie wrapped around it resembled the dreams of a 12 year old boys fantasies
May 26 2015,positive,not a big fan of the actors in fury road any of them does it matter nope just a great ride with walltowall action as long as you understand this is the king of b movies youll enjoy this
May 26 2015,positive,i was looking forward to seeing hardy better utilized than he was in dark knight rises and the truth is hes not ultimately though it doesnt matter this movie is rip roaring loud brash fun from start to finish a cacophony of colour and sound from the moment it sets off youll feel like youre on fury road with them there are some tremendous set pieces and fair play to george miller still a visionary at his age great film best of the 4 and if they decide not to make any more a terrific way to sign off
May 26 2015,positive,it is difficult to find a moment to catch your breath during mad max fury road for the fights and chases are relentless our perspective speeds up slows down zooms in and out and pulsates in harmony with the nonstop action at the beginning of the third act we finally get a short interlude to process the events that have unraveled and the final efforts to come but outside of that short glimpse of calm we are subject to a ceaseless pursuit  fascinatingly the endless action of fury road doesnt manage to undermine anything else that the film has going for it its a truly unique phenomenon for a movie to strut such endless style in execution and not lack anything in narrative and emotional payoff the streamlined plot is a masterclass in simplicity rooted in a firm theme of feminism charlize therons imperator furiosa is much more of the catalyst for the plot of fury road than tom hardys max rockatanscky thats not to say that max is any less important but that he becomes caught up in the machinations of furiosa and ultimately assists her and her cohorts as an exemplification of his unflinching nobility max and furiosa are portrayed as being equal in capability and resourcefulness furiosa the resolute freedom fighter max the chivalrous survivor the message of feminism is notable simply because its embarrassingly rare for a blockbuster film to pass the bechdel test something that fury road does with flying colors  despite the film being a sequel fury road requires no background from the original films and feels just as original as a film created without any source material its very likely that it was viewed as just as much of a risk as an original film by studio executives emphasized by the fact that the film spent the better part of the last 30 years in development hell however thanks to the determination of writerdirector george miller the revitalizing energy of tom hardys quiet demeanor and deep baritone and charlize therons reckless abandon audiences everywhere have been able to experience the joy ride that is fury road a joy ride that is mesmerizing in how practical and realistic its effects are despite the cartoonish nature of some of it characterizations these characterizations exist to provide the film with an almost silentfilm purity implying that had you been provided with no dialogue you couldve still gotten the impact of all that unfolds based off of visuals alone  george miller has made it look so easy from making revered childrens movies most recently to blazing a trail back to the franchise that got him started in cinema all the while making a film that is likely to be viewed as the standardbearer for pure action movies going forward so effortlessly does fury road immerse the audience in its saturated orange and teal postapocalyptic wasteland that it makes you feel familiar with mad max universe even if you have no prior experience but if you have seen what has come before it it seems as if it has just been waiting to be dusted off and rediscovered anew for all these years  perhaps the ultimate success of fury road is that it is not a film about the potential end of the world or the saving of all humanity as so many blockbusters are today in mad max the world is already over and humanity as we know it is gone rather it is a film about the survival of one and the redemption of another thus providing a world seemingly too far gone with a slither of hope despite the insurmountable obstacles that lie before it pretty deep stuff for a film that at its core is a twohour car chase
May 26 2015,positive,an utterly unique sweat inducing chase movie with interesting characters this movie isnt bogged down with exposition scenes its a show instead of tell piece of cinema why cant all action movies be like this
May 26 2015,negative,this is a c movie with an a budget to its credit it is the best worst movie ive seen in years its only saving grace is that it is difficult to tell if the movie takes itself seriously or not if all thats desired is a mindless 2hr chase scene that lacks any semblance of plot or character development then this is a movie to be considered
May 26 2015,positive,everything good about the road warrior to the nth degree  mainly incredibly cool costume and production design as well as a great concept that is the darkest and most memorable of all the visions of postapocalyptic dystopia presented in the mad max movies
May 26 2015,positive,this is by far the best film of the year and probably of the decade george miller reinvented himself with a masterpiece that undoubtedly will be overcome and forget
May 26 2015,positive,the hype and praise has been very high the energy of the film is also very high and the madness equally so   the action scenes are amazing however the film gives you so many that after awhile they lose their impact when the characters decide to turn back youre left to think really we have to go through it all again    what was missing for me was max there was no development of maxs character max in part one starts out as a man with a wife and a child and some sort of normal life despite the crumbling world around him he should remember these times he should remember the old world and all that he lost yet i never feel number 2 or this film really link to number one this film just leaves him in the background whilst it focuses on furiosa     furiosa is well played by theron but theres not really that much to her character its all swallowed by the endless over the top action    but the pacing of the film and the creativeness of the action does entertain and its a visual masterpiece if not a narrative one     great to see hugh keaysbyrne return to the series as i thought he was a great villain in the original not the same character here but just as effective as the villain
May 26 2015,negative,okay im just not getting it  we really enjoyed the first movies in this series but this one was a yawner  if you like to see things blown up youll love it  if youre looking for anything in the way of a story line not so much  dont waste your money on the 3d version its definitely not worth it  our theater was pretty much empty  now i know why  pass on this one
May 26 2015,positive,awesome popcorn flick
May 26 2015,positive,very strange things happen in this one but the action is unbeatable
May 26 2015,positive,god this movie is mad fun yes the movie takes its time to develop but its an awesome ride till the end overthetop stunts great speed and mild gore with the occasional laugh moments the guitar guy is awesome catch this movie if you can perhaps stop thinking much about the story and you will be in for a hell of a ride
May 26 2015,negative,so yeah the movie was a good action film the explosions were awesome the car chase was good but the nearly complete void that was screen time for mad max kind of ruined it it was a mad max movie without the max in it shrug the title was a lie
May 26 2015,positive,are you not entertained
May 26 2015,positive,watch it for the action choreography and visuals the story and characters exist to serve that dont expect to be moved like a tragedy but rocked like a rollercoaster its very loud
May 26 2015,positive,there should be an oscar for action movies because this film deserves one maybe the first feminist actionadventure motion picture ever made with women motivating and executing the story to a maternal conclusion fury road takes us on a powerhouse thrill ride stuffed full of superb performances stunts visual effects and a kick ass apocalyptic art design and most engaging of all the sound design and mix perhaps the best rebootsequel of all time
May 26 2015,positive,best movie of the decade d  tom should have more line tho
May 26 2015,positive,amazing action and spectacle but dont quite get the 95 rating will have to watch again
May 26 2015,positive,very different movie good but just filmed different and feels different actors did an amazing job tho constant action and drama
May 26 2015,negative,this was way over the top fairly silly film i dont think ive seen anything this metal in the theater before
May 25 2015,positive,an amazing journey in a time and place unlike any other  our future on earth  prepare yourselves
May 25 2015,positive,phenomenal and that is the an understament
May 25 2015,positive,greatest movie this year hands down  awesome acting picture and epics cars must see if into good action
May 25 2015,positive,absolutely a modern masterpiece bravo
May 25 2015,negative,this movie blows its really bad
May 25 2015,positive,am excellent and over the top movie i am immensely happy to see a movie with women standing up for themselves and holding their own next to men  its also refreshing that its not another crappy hollywood remake and george miller is still directing
May 25 2015,positive,best action movie of 2015
May 25 2015,positive,post apocalyptic lunacy on a level never breathed on before by previous movies 2 hours plus of pure bliss apocalyptic style
May 25 2015,positive,perhaps i am acting a bit prematurely on this one but i know what i like and i love this movie many of the movies i am selecting have hit me on an emotional level as well as excelling in craft and artistry and this film is no different when ideas are conveyed through action you have my attention when the intelligence of the filmgoer is respected you have my admiration and when you have me invested all the while through a two hour film without losing me once you have my heart this is one of the best films i have ever seen hands down this should be studied for years to come top 10 for sure
May 25 2015,negative,mario kart has more story to it than this movie everything cool and exciting is shown in the first 10 mins and in the trailers
May 25 2015,positive,a rollercoaster ride from the beginning to the end best actionthriller movie so far this year
May 25 2015,positive,what a lovely day indeed    writerdirector george miller has revisited and reinvented his mad max franchise quite flamboyantly in full disclosure i had no idea that mad max was a pre existing franchise until after i saw the first trailer for the film although when i saw tom hardy and charlize theron i became slightly interested i believed that these two oozed amazing chemistry like the previous installments there was a nuclear war that led us to this postapocalyptic world food and water are noticeably scarce from beginning to end it is nonstop over the top action it fairly reminded me of the old video game twisted metal which we all know is all about absolute mayhem so many explosions so many collisions so much anarchy this film roars with an absolute vengeance       every aspect of the film is beautiful the score by junkie xl was absolutely riveting it had my heart racing when the action started up and it just felt so perfect it really placed the film on a more grand scale this really excites me because xl produced the score for the upcoming film dawn of justice along with hans zimmer so i am definitely intrigued to see what those two were able to accomplish together my favorite thing about the film was definitely the camera work the way that george miller and john seale were able to make this world look so visually stunning yet still so destitute is by far some of the best camera work i have seen this year the rotations and the tracking shots were just wonderful to see this a film that is made for the big screen it is absolutely visually stunning the vehicles they created for this film look like something straight out of a comic book and when you see them you cant help but to stare in awe it makes this world of desperation something to be slightly desired the acting definitely is a high point for me as well because the ball could have easily been dropped if not handled properly for instance when charlize theron is on screen she steals every second she is almost unrecognizable as a tortured soul who has had enough of this so called society everything that she does seems so instinctual and sometimes although justified barbaric she really becomes her character and allows herself to be taken into this world  for those that may have grown a bit tired of the post apocalyptic films that we have been bombarded with over the years fear not for mad max fury road has successfully changed the game in the beginning sequence of the film we meet the eponymous character max rockatansky played by the incomparable tom hardy we quickly realize that he is already in a bit of a pickle just from the opening ten minutes we learn that hes a troubled soul and that he is doing the same thing that everyone else in this world has been forced to do survive his survival skills are instantly put to the test once he is captured by the war boys the army of immortan joe the films main antagonist the capture scene is so well choreographed and so amazing to watch the world that miller creates is so unique and beautiful something that only his mind could conjure up its an absolute barren wasteland full of vehicular warfare of the greatest caliber the film is full of a mass population that looks savage however these are just everyday people that are trying to survive at this time all that people know is carnage chaos and catastrophe naturally we should all be able to relate to the survival aspect there is no order only a seemingly tyrannical rule led by one immortan joe there are some who follow hence his army of war boys and there are some that believe that he is the reason that the world is still the way it is insert imperator furiosa       fury road explains how max who seems to be a bit of a drifter meets and works with imperator furiosa once these two meet up it is nonstop action while the action slows down a bit you learn furiosas purpose and it is a rather plausible story arc as a moviegoer who appreciates dialogue i was a bit disappointed in some of the writing some of it seemed to be forced and other parts seem like they did not belong at all for example there is one instance in the film where miller tries to create some emotional investment between two of the characters however in my opinion it translate well the film is well paced and at a run time of 2 hours flat its a really good film to go see with friends especially if you are an action junkie oddly enough after watching this film i do not have any interest in viewing the original mad max trilogy starring mel gibson i loved this film and i just feel like this is something that can very well stand on its own a very interesting take on a post apocalyptic world from the mastermind george miller he successfully created one of the best action films ive ever seen
May 25 2015,positive,wow  thats what another guy coming out of the theatre said after the movie said that was amazing  if you want to see almost nonstop action and see all kinds of shit blow up then this is the movie for you  it is almost like a nonstop chase scene in the dystopian future  they do manage to fit in plot and character development so you actually care about what is happening and why  the visuals are pretty amazing and not for those who are easily put off by people with mouths sewed shut or gross skin conditions missing limbs or other weird deformities brought on by whatever nuclear apocalypse killed the world  charlize theron kicks ass and thomas hardy isnt a bad sidekick
May 25 2015,positive,great action really weird
May 25 2015,positive,this the best most grandiose action spectacle ever made it may be equaled someday but can never be topped for the result would be far too ludicrous to be any good  i sincerely hope they never make a sequel
May 25 2015,positive,you heard the hype its the truth go see this movie now
May 25 2015,positive,one of the best action movies ever made in the past decade this is the die hard of the millennial generation fast paced brutal and beautifully shot this is not for the light of heart charlize theron steals the show and tom hardy proves a worthy successor of mel gibson you dont see a movie like this every day
May 25 2015,negative,relentless ridiculous action zero plot zero script pretty sad sorry remake but hey some of the others where pretty bad
May 25 2015,negative,the worst movie ive ever seen
May 25 2015,positive,awesome my favorite movie in years aggressive and fulfilling in the oddest way bravo
May 25 2015,positive,crazy mad and with a sense of desperation  very nice presentation and details furiosa is without a doubt the main force
May 25 2015,positive,beautifully done with a good story and lots of action
May 25 2015,positive,mad max fury road is no doubt one of the best films this year it stands out among the rest because of its complex and twisted world building strong and compelling heroines stunning visual effects and action scenes and most especially its unique and moving story this film literally has the most dangerous and explosive car chase ive ever seen in any film and i saw the whole fast  furious film franchise    george miller is indeed a genius to create such a twistedly beautiful story of survival and to actually sell it is not easy i am very impressed with the world building the details the whole atmosphere and feel of it got stuck on me i imagined i would not last in that dry and disease infested world where everyone has to fight for food and water     max tom hardy and imperator furiosa charlize theron are two compelling characters that clearly have different agendas caught in a brutal world they are forced to be on but because of a common enemy undecidedly became the strongest of allies watching these two heroines exchange guns and the steering wheel is nothing but exciting and thrilling     everything about mad max fury road is mindblowing an edgeofyourseat experience that doesnt flood you with too much script this film is all about the goods its wildly actionpacked oozes with pure adrenaline and it doesnt run out of surprises really what a lovely day
May 25 2015,positive,wow just amazing film ridiculous bizarre incredible
May 25 2015,positive,i could can say so much about this but but you have to see it to believe it the thing is that youve already heard a lot about the action and stunt absolutely kick ass perfect the genre defying female roles yes they are there and they delivered  but here is the thing this is just good as a movie everything is so put together the color the visual design the acting the cinematography and most importantly the character development  someone told me this is just 2 hours of action barely anything else god they were wrong substance is not some kind of  weirdly twisted mind game that the movie tries to use to fuck with the audience it is character study it is asking of what makes people themselves and what makes them no longer themselves  and this movie did that perfectly every single fight scene say something about the character who they are what they care what they believe in what makes them strong and what makes them weak every death mattered why is this person died who killed them what does it mean to die what does it mean to watch somebody die  this is 2  hours of nonstop action alright but also 2 hours of solid character writing actually with so many speaking characters it would have to be filled with character study or all of them will end up being characters that could entirely be cut most blockbusters today have too many actor and too few roles  the second time i watched on my way home i was asking myself if there is a single moment that could be cut from the movie without seriously reduce at least one of the characters and there wasnt this movie is that tight    ooops actually wrote a lot
May 25 2015,negative,this isnt a mad max movie  its a movie set in the mad max universe  max tags along as a third wheel in his own movie with a handful of extremely short lines think arnold schwarzenegger in conan the barbarian but with less screen time   movie should have been called furiousa a mad max universe movie and would have been a solid ab of a movie  problem is they did some kind of bait and switch  only reason people are ok with the main character that the movie is titled after being pushed into the background is because they werent mad max fans to begin with  imagine if a character you liked was made into a side character in their own movie  as a fan it sucks
May 25 2015,positive,great story great action and we dont need mel gibson d
May 25 2015,positive,absolutely positively enjoyed this movie from beginning to end pure non stop action i have never seen anything like it this is a must see
May 25 2015,positive,not only the best action film ever made but one of the greatest movies ever made an instant classic
May 25 2015,negative,there is zero acting or plot development basically mad max was two hours of very loud suspense music and more cgi than all of the matrix movies combined
May 25 2015,positive,an action movie thats not afraid to be an action movie    max  whats it been  thirty years      yes you heard me right folks no less than three decades have passed since beyond thunderdome came out in theatres and australian director george miller gave us such iconic characters as masterblaster aunty entity lord humungous no wait that was mad max 2  well he was still pretty boss and that grim paragon of few words mad max former outback cop turned road warrior who drifts through the postapocalyptic wasteland much like the biblical wandering jew seemingly ageless and forever the favorite whipping boy of bandits scoundrels or just ordinary folk who see in his gruff demeanor and mysterious past some sin of the old world that needs expatiating or at the very least a good ass kicking  the series has indeed come a long way from the 1979 original with its shoestring budget and liveaction duels between yellow squad cars and motorcycle thugs which now seem almost tame by comparison with the latest iteration from the same director who it seems has yet to lose his touch  fury road is the kind of action movie for people who love action movies  it doesnt waste time in exposition  it doesnt force us to watch the obligatory intimate scene between the hero and heroine for the misguided and lets face it sexistly condescending purpose of catering to the paper tissue demographic  from start to finish its nothing but blood sand and highoctane madness and spectacle delivered in much the same black comic vein as the original films with no quarter given as to limits of our attention spans or stomachs  we find max rockatansky played with hard reserve by tom hardy out in the desert doing his usual drifter thing and in true series tradition wasting no time in getting captured  pressed into service as a blood bank for the phlegmatic warlord immortan joe played by hugh keayburn although you cant really tell beneath that mask and his army of whitepainted war boys  maxs situation does indeed seem dire until fate throws another bone his way in the form of two equally deranged personalities nux nicholas hoult a war boy looking to prove himself in battle and enter valhalla and imperator furiousa played by charlize theron never averse to chopping her locks and putting some dirt on her face for the sake of art one of joes lieutenants who unbeknownst to him has just absconded with something very precious to him indeed  five somethings in fact  i wont go spoiling it further lets just say youll spend the majority of film watching the longest most outlandish and most violently destructive chase in mad max history if not movie history itself
May 25 2015,positive,mad max returns and the original main villain from the first 1979 movie immortan joe also returns played by hugh keaysbyrne i thought this was a good movie even though the plot seemed like a jumbled mess with no real character development from some of the people the stranger mad max meets some of the characters  such as the vestal virgins and the ginger vestal virgins skinhead boyfriend nux played by nicholas hoult were kind of annoying at first    but the intense action scenes of cars and trucks racing against each other and the breathtaking exotic landscape made up for the lack of a real plot tom hardy and charlize theron put a pretty good effort as mad max and furiosa the costumes the weird make of the cars and trucks and the exotic desert landscape made the movie look like it took place in another planet rather than a postapocalyptic australian outback    overall this is a good movie to take your children and wife or girlfriend to even though theres a lot of combat violence we actually dont see a real bloody mess such as limbs and heads flying out of car crash collisions i didnt hear any profanity like in military combat movies and horror movies theres no gratuitous sex scenes and make out scenes the two main characters mad max and furiosa are allies only in their predicament nothing more hopefully there will be more sequels to come
May 25 2015,positive,sensory overload makes this a movie that should be seen on the big screen at least twice in addition ill be purchasing it when its available on bluray
May 25 2015,positive,you have to admire a director who is so committed to his vision that hes not afraid to go all out no matter how weird or ridiculous it gets  not much in the way of story but the nearly wall to wall action make this thoroughly entertaining  forget max i want a movie fully devoted to furiosa
May 25 2015,positive,before this movie never in my life have i gone to see the same movie in theaters more than once with that being said ive seen mad max four times in theaters and am still not sick of it
May 25 2015,positive,george miller did what chris nolan could not do with interstellar     an amazingly choreographed action movie with deep commentary about water the cruelty and savagery of men juxtaposed with themes of redemption as well as the need for the dichotomy of man and woman with little dialogue miller somehow presents what seems to be a simple story yet tackles modern day issues in a visceral and fantastic setting while being grounded in reality     unlike interstellar which had beautiful puzzle pieces but awkward and clumsy when put together mad max manages to pull its beautifully destructive action sequences into a simplistic fable that just makes sense without sacrificing complexity and deeper meaning    tldr fucking amazing blockbuster for sure its got something for everybody the bitties doeeeeee
May 25 2015,neutral,im probably going to piss off people who loved it but i think mad max fury road couldve easily been called mad max meh     visually this film delivered and the action and acting were great but its hard to overcome the apathy caused by a 2 hour long car chase you kind of got to know the characters and of course you want the heroes to triumph over the evil dictator but if they dont win they still live in a shitty postapocalyptic world so its kind of inconsequential    mad maxfury road its a good excuse to eat popcorn and candy but i cant say i agree with the stellar reviews it has received
May 25 2015,positive,the best action film in years absolutely breathtaking and awesome in every way amazing direction acting and cinematography a filmmaking tour de force
May 25 2015,positive,wild great producing writing acting etc for those who can stomach a violent apocalyptic fantasy film this is worth it
May 25 2015,positive,an amazing spectacle of a film  nonstop action from start to finish  yet it does require a degree of intellect  attentiveness and attention to detail to get all the elements of a deep narrative masterful
May 25 2015,positive,even after two viewings i feel as though ive only scratched the surface of mad max fury road george millers action fantasy is astonishingly dense for a bigbudget spectacle not only in its imagery and ideas but in the complex interplay between them
May 25 2015,positive,burning man on lsd  fast fun and furious  no character develop meant but really is any needed
May 25 2015,positive,kind of movie that you want to see again and again and again
May 25 2015,positive,a solid meh after the first hour of the road chase it all started to wear a little thin
May 25 2015,positive,action action action and music up the      as   intense and fun
May 25 2015,positive,im so happy that in this era of cookiecutter bondwannabe action flicks one can actually rise to the top like this one has
May 25 2015,positive,it was so good i saw it twice
May 25 2015,positive,this movie was amazing so intense
May 25 2015,positive,as famous film critic albert kugel said the hype is pretty justified but i aint riding that train all the way to the station if ya know what im sayin hehehe
May 25 2015,negative,charlize theron nor tom hardy could save this movie i think good reviews mustve been paid for because this was so bad by the time i saw tom hardy swinging from a harpoon across two moving vehicles i was laughing out loud
May 25 2015,positive,wanted to be better than it was     rubbish movie glad when it finally ended
May 25 2015,positive,apparently if you liked the original then youll like this i never enjoyed the original enough to sit and watch the thing all the way thru now as an adult even less desire very grimy well acted tho and a lot for the eye to see
May 25 2015,positive,fans of the franchise will not be disappointed and thats a rare statement these days  i went into this movie ready to be disappointed by another phantom menacerobocop2014the hobbit trilogytotal recall you get the point  this is what a reboot should be loyal to the premise and style of the original but bringing in a new story new characters and bringing in some modern technology but not fully relying on it  those were real cars driving and getting wrecked in the desert and while there was some cgi mixed in for a few larger than life spectacles it wasnt overwhelming    as many have said this film will be appreciated more by people who saw the originals because it is a sequel and while fairly independent of the others it did seem to take advantage of an established premise  kind of like how you could enjoy the avengers if you hadnt seen any of the build up movies and had never read a comic but youd probably be a little confused as to why that guy was hurling lightning bolts out of a hammer or why a billionaire is flying around in a suit of armor      mad max established maxs personal story of losing his family and battling highway outlaws road warrior showed us how societies formed in the postapocalyptic world and the crazy nature of the marauders and their vehicles  thunderdome happened we wish it didnt but it did we can accept that and move on    this was the road warrior sequel we all wished beyond thunderdome was high octane chases with road battles and steam punk vehicles and weapons  the tech is stepped up because it has to be based on an apocalypse that happens after today not after 30 days ago but the stories told have already been taken for granted    trying to force in exposition about max or the tribes would be an insult to fans of the franchise and slow down the movie unneccessarily  using the avengers as an example again can you imagine if they had tried to explain each characters origin in that one movie while trying to fit in its own adventure how boring would that be  i actually liked that they rushed the introductions so the characters could perform their actions without overly explaining why  there was enough there to figure out what was going on and the fact that it made you wait to get all the details added to the fun in my opinion
May 25 2015,positive,awesome 3d like really amazing sound was noteworthy  loud charlize  tom hardy were so stoically badass as well all the really weird costuming  violence is really not my thing but i can appreciate how well it was done
May 25 2015,neutral,this movie started out with promise visually striking innovative 3d action sequences unfortunately cracked under the continuous stream of the same emotion not a fan of cirque de soleil the feminist angle was interesting but lacked character development wouldnt sit  through again
May 25 2015,negative,that was the worst film ever ever i wanted to walk out soooooo bad havent felt so bored in a movie since twin peaks this movie is one long car chasewar scene period there is literally nothing else going on in the movie i want my 30 back
May 25 2015,positive,great movie plot was good and action was even better a revolution of a film if that makes any sense george miller does it again go see it now
May 25 2015,negative,what the fuck this is actually a shity movie that dont have any story ecstructure starts with a strange backstory and the worst deaths ever like i dont know if this movie has any connection with the other ones but like you start with a backstory that will never be revealed insted if you watched the other mad max movies i didnt watched the other mad max movies so the personalty of max is bad as shit tom hardy interpretated max so bad that even nicolas cage could did better in my opinion chris pratt could did better and max dont have almost any close on this movie like furiosa have more personality than max could the movie been called mad furiosa fury road so this movoe is bad as shit sorry but i hated it
May 25 2015,negative,ive never been compelled to leave a review until now  this movie has received overwhelming acclaim and i have vowed to remove any friend on my fb page that claims to enjoy it  worst movie imaginable  im embarassed to have given money to this load of shit
May 25 2015,positive,just take a minute and breathe
May 25 2015,negative,walked out  i will never get those 60 minutes of my life back  complete garbage
May 25 2015,positive,its definitely epic
May 25 2015,positive,knowing what it is a comic book movie with the main attraction is cgi graphics 90 action and some story this filled all the checkboxes theron is super as is hardy supporting cast did their thing or course no industry recognition for this but a good use of 2 hours
May 25 2015,positive,absolutely incredible universe with some of the best action sequences ever created this reality is so gritty deep and surreal amazing and should not be missed watch it now
May 25 2015,negative,this was so far the weakest movie i have seen this year  the acting was subpar the effects were below average the story line was far to weak and i wasnt expecting hardly any story line  the effects in avengers aou were far better and as for story line furious 7 which i went to see just for action and cars was much better  i regret the time wasted watching this movie and at least i only spent matinee money on it
May 25 2015,positive,if i could give half stars it would be 25 but nothing like the original mad max this max got his ass kicked a lot
May 25 2015,positive,crazy action and beautifully filmed with an amazing soundtrackwhat a great ride
May 25 2015,negative,this movie is very well made with special effectswise but it lacks a story line after the first 30 minutes the action becomes tedious and boresome
May 25 2015,positive,wicked fun a great time
May 25 2015,positive,this is amazing you have to watch it
May 25 2015,positive,madmax the loudest almost silent movie ever go see it
May 25 2015,negative,a great spectacular explosion of nonsense  no story or character development  max plays second fiddle to the real star charlize theron the movie is one over long chase scene afrom point a to point b and back to point a again im giving it a star for the vehicles and costumes is this what gets almost 100 on the tomato meter these days
May 25 2015,positive,nonstop action and perhaps the best stunt work in any movie ive seen
May 25 2015,positive,this movie was the best mad max movie and had lots of action and adventure
May 25 2015,positive,an epic spectacle of postapocalyptic maxterpiece  a real work of art
May 25 2015,positive,you know what youre getting with this move  its not treading any new ground  but what it does do is take all that high octane action you knew and loved from the first three movies and brings it up to date withmodern cinematography and over the top action  it does not disappoint
May 25 2015,positive,what a movie what a lovely lovely movie enough said
May 25 2015,positive,best movie of 2015 so far due to all the action and effects  the characters were very well acted as well and there was never a dull moment the movie is a must see for both action fans and mad max fans
May 25 2015,positive,not much of a story here action some more action and just when you think a story is going to kick in more action personally i think the ratings are higher then deserved
May 25 2015,positive,they should have called it charlize therons fury road and she is the real star
May 25 2015,positive,wild and crazy totally lived up to the hype also amazing 3d want to see it again
May 25 2015,positive,exactly the mad max we know and love all action and abomination
May 25 2015,positive,i enjoyed this but no where near as much as i had hoped i would the first half of the film is kinda boring not visually mind just from a characterstory perspective the 2nd half of the film was much better  just wish they got the first half right
May 25 2015,positive,i cant remember the last time i left the theater and felt the way i did when i saw fury road  as if i just witnessed some massive event unfold in front of my eyes  in a time of overcgi marvel movies fury road stands out with excellent visuals and an incredible cast
May 25 2015,positive,a well defined postapocalyptic world that kept me riveted  to the screen
May 25 2015,positive,action packed from beginning to end
May 25 2015,positive,maybe the best sequel to any movie in cinematic history honestly this will sit atop the action movie throne for ages
May 25 2015,positive,great graphics but the story line needs help
May 25 2015,positive,quite possibly the most visually masterful piece of film ive seen in my entire life
May 25 2015,negative,and a surprising amount of narrative heft        think im gonna have to disagree with you there rotten tomatoes
May 25 2015,positive,very good movie and action packed but  a little less believable than the originals which brings this down just a tad bit  main points of contention is the widescale use of guns a fully operational mind operated bionic arm and that they never explain the war boys issues or origin  other than that there is not much not to like imo unless you are very violence adverse   maybe a slight shallow in plot development but what else did you expect from this movie  plus i like how the original toecutter was part of the flick
May 25 2015,positive,mad max offers exciting action scenes and talented acting despite coming up short on story telling
May 25 2015,positive,i actually enjoyed this movie lots of action
May 25 2015,positive,absolutely love it tom hardy kills this role
May 25 2015,positive,an allyoucaneat buffet of hyperintense megaaction wildly insanely overthetop what it lacks in story and plot it amply makes up for in fights and explosions occasionally interspersed with some fights and explosions
May 25 2015,negative,what this movie needs less stunts less victoria secret models more story more acting more questions answered
May 25 2015,positive,directed with confidence fury road is a visually exciting film with some spectacular action sequences
May 25 2015,negative,this film is highly overrated granted action from start to finish but weve seen that a million times before highly predictable plot and will bore you to sleep if u youre not careful
May 25 2015,positive,fun popcorn movie for a rainy afternoon
May 25 2015,negative,its one long fight on the road
May 25 2015,negative,this is possibly one of the worst movies i have ever seen dont go see it i promise its a trap  no plot tom hardy only had about 15 lines  and some of the things they put in it made no sense  i love the comic but this was just bad
May 25 2015,positive,just back from seeing mad max fury road its been about an hour since the movie let out and i have almost successfully slowed my heart rate back to normal     to say this movie is a little bit intense is like saying a ghost pepper has a little bit of a kick this might have spoiled all future action movies for me by setting the bar so ridiculously high     wow
May 25 2015,positive,a non stop action flick has some really intense moments and just an overall fun movie i am invested in these characters and hope to see further adventures of these characters please make more mad max movies
May 25 2015,positive,almost as goad as the road warrior
May 25 2015,positive,crazy and kitsch with amazing stunts all those irrational imaginings of a postapocalyptic  society blended with excessive design led to a oneofa kind kick ass movie
May 25 2015,positive,was a nonstop thrill ride with interesting characters and enough action to satisfy and surpasses many modern action movies
May 25 2015,positive,frightening action pack from start to finish
May 25 2015,positive,after mel gibsons success in the classic and most fun movies i have seen tom hardy comes along and just plain kills it charlize theron is basically the one thats badass in this but tom hardy did most of the job with the weirdness and most disturbing moments mad max fury road is sure one of my favorite ever yet
May 25 2015,positive,lots of action had a great date night and walked out of the theater satisfied well worth the 3d price
May 25 2015,positive,as good of a pure action film as ive seen to date
May 25 2015,positive,one of the best action films ive see in years
May 25 2015,positive,eyepoppingly amazing action movie light on plot but more than youd expect and they do a decent job of making you care about the characters uses old cliches to good effect the great car chases reminded me of the indiana jones 3 tank scene  visceral and thrilling recommended
May 25 2015,positive,have seen it twice so far pretty sure i will go again5 out of 5
May 25 2015,positive,the best action movie of the past 15 years if not ever
May 25 2015,positive,mad max fury road is definitely not a film for everyone  your enjoyment of the film is almost entirely predicated on whether or not your accept the over the top and crazy world that cowriter and director george miller previous mad max trilogy happy feet babe pig in the city has passionately brought back to life after 30 years  if you dont accept the madness youre sure to hate this movie if you do given into it then youre in for a unique action thrill ride that possesses a surprising amount of emotion for a film that is at least 50 chase sequences and takes a good 30 minutes before the film really gets to a lets you stop and take its narrative  as someone who has only seen the original 1979 mad max and enjoyed it despite its dated appearance i can totally see where fury road respresents a truer more elaborate and technically impressive vision of what he wanted to do back then but by no means do you need to have seen the other mad max films to understand the film its pretty standalone although i think viewing the older films will only enhance the experience  the action sequences are extremely well made and choreographed relying primarily on traditional stunt work and practical effects although theyre done so well you might very well mistake them for cgi  this isnt fast and furious level cgifest but very stylishly done old school action  the scope and scale of the film is grand and epic in every sense of the world you feel how desolate this world is and there are a view visual set pieces a giant sandstorm for instance that will make your jaw drop in awe  in terms of the story its really quite simple imperator furiosa charlize theron in an intense yet suprisingly subdued and heartfelt performance has stolen maniacal cult leader immortan joes wives and plans to smuggle them to the safe place she grew up in before she stolen away as a child  almost out of convenience she enlists the aid of former policeman mad max rockatansky tom hardy in an effective minimalist performance that invokes more of mel gibsons mad max character towards the end of the original mad max film who was previously captured by immortan joe to help her in her quest  while a bulk of the film is dedicated to immortan joe and his army chasing furiosa and her convoy through the post apocalyptic desert the film really finds a great place halfway through film where after almost 3040 minutes of nonstop action the film stops and pauses and lets you really get to know the characters and their place their plight in this world  despite being called mad max max is very much part of an ensemble cast that includes therons character nicholas hoult young beast from xmen  days of future past as a former member of immortan joes cult who turns ally for max and furiosa and after the film takes this huge emotional sigh in its 2nd act that is bookended by crazy action sequences at least in my case i found myself invested in the fate of the characters  now despite the film having an astounding 98 rotten tomatoes score and an 89 on metacritic the film isnt without some flaws that i think people may be overlooking amongst the audacity spectacle and uniqueness of the film  as mentioned the story is pretty simple and its actually a wonder that i was invested in a 2 hr story that could have been told in 90 minutes or less but in the first 30 minutes you get blindsided bombarded with a lot of plot set up that you have to really pay attention to because a lot of the films expository dialogue especially in the beginning is delivered so fast that you cant really catch what you need  it also doesnt help that max speaks with a mask on for the first part of the film something hardy should be used to by now considering his previous role as bane and immortan joe speaks with a mask on for the whole film  for all the flack interstellar got for having a sound mix that drowned out the dialogue i found mad max had the same problem and yet it doesnt seem anyone is harping about it  i understand miller going for a film that is more visual and visceral than dialogue heavy but for a film whose world is almost entirely original some needed expository dialogue to provide context needs to presented in a way that the audience can hear and understand  i managed to keep up with the story simply on visual context but i definitely feel like id need a second viewing to catch everything  the films action is stylish but occasionally relentless and while miller manages to effectively end these action sequences before they become too monotonous i definitely feel like miller was so enthusiastic in his presentation that the stylishness can be overwhelming to the viewer and that at times i thought miller wouldve benefited from reigning himself in a bit  i think that a second viewing can really help in getting everything you need from the film knowing kind of already what some of the story and characters you can get a better feel for the film as parts of a whole rather than as one large experience  the one thing mad max fury road can not be accused of his feeling fake or disingenuous the world feels authentic all the actors disappear into this world and its very apparent that george miller after 30 years let all of his passion and eccentricity fly  mad max fury road is truly a unique artistic vision a operatic punk rock scifi western art blockbuster that will definitely not be everyones cup of tea  while i think the film might be a tad overrated and i do want to see the film one more time to kind of do a reevaluation mad max is still the best big summer film ive seen so far  ill give mad max fury road a provisional upon second viewing score of 455 stars a
May 25 2015,positive,freaking masterpiece
May 25 2015,positive,a brilliant dystopian film stunning cinematography and soundtrack the actors were flawless so good to see tom hardy in such a good role
May 25 2015,positive,brilliant movie pure action all the way visually stunning tom hardy and charlize theron really excelled woukd watch again but got work tomorrow lol
May 25 2015,negative,disappointing  i normally like these kinds of movies
May 25 2015,positive,best movie of the year
May 25 2015,positive,great action and musicsound but its just really a very long car chase the film is mental but its more style over substance reminds me of 300
May 25 2015,positive,action action action  did i forget action
May 25 2015,positive,excellent movie obviously great action decent acting
May 25 2015,positive,a heck of a lot better than other postapocalyptic films most entertained ive felt in a long time
May 25 2015,negative,more of a rollercoaster ride than a film action movies can be great but this film which is based entirely on car chases and explosions left me feeling bemused
May 25 2015,positive,this is one movie that if you miss watching in the cinemas in 3d you will regret it its better to entirely miss out on this one then to save you that regret superbly acted powercharged script and actionsequences made this movie a masterpiece nothing less expected from the mastermind george miller this is why he never let go of the title for 30 years this is a sequel that does justice to the franchise and then some for many more years to come mad max fury road is going to be the best sequel ever  i am dazed i am still overwhelmed i watched the movie in 3d and often actually closed my eyes in impulse the 3d experience is that awesome the action sequences are so rigorous so cruel so mind blowing you will clinch your teeth watching them feel like closing your eyes and keep watching cause you cant afford to miss a single second of this masterpiece   they say that the length of the movie is 2 hours something however in my experience it might have been like 5 seconds or even a whole life time depends on how you see it the only fact remains you will be fully satisfied you will come out feeling that its time invested not spent watch it now if you are going to watch only one movie this year let it be mad max fury road heck if its the last movie you can watch for the rest of your life let it be this movie yes its that kind of movie    mad max  fury road is the best action film since die hard watch it now
May 25 2015,positive,mad max is a brilliant masterpiece from director george miller hollywood once again hits its milestone with the best action movie of the decade
May 25 2015,positive,lots of action  enjoyable
May 25 2015,positive,great remake and cast specialeffects were great and i love this reboot of the series i think tom hardys character needs to speak a little bit more because i think theres much more to offer the original mad max character played by mel gibson had more powerful presence i cant wait to see the next one
May 25 2015,positive,so amazing tons and tons of endless action which might be too much but in the end i never thought they could make an incredible movie about a truck driving in the desert
May 25 2015,positive,epic the only movie that could ever  beat it wold be machete kills in space
May 25 2015,positive,fury road is the best movie of the year to date an outstanding achievement of movie making
May 25 2015,positive,george miller is an absolute visionary and brings to life the most chaotic and stunning postapocalyptic world ever to be seen in film acting visuals storyline and action are all of the highest quality this installment of mad max is on par with the road warrior by far the best movie of the year so far a must see
May 25 2015,positive,having never seen any of the previous mad max films i was a bit hesitant to jump into this one but after hearing such great things about fury road i had to see what the fuss was about fury road is an amazing action movie and the type of action movie you just dont see any more one that isnt mindless mindnumbing cg nonsense even though this film is pretty much a two hour chase scene it still takes a few moments to let you catch your breath now and again it has genuine character development and it has a female character not just supporting the male lead but actually holding her own in fact what is most monumental about the story is how the two main leads help each other playing to each others strengths throughout the story they use teamwork not a man saving a woman or a woman saving the day despite the fact that she is a woman but two people working together regardless of gender    the films world is fully realized yet never clumsily explained things just are the way they are and we can enjoy seeing it without having it shoved down our throats many of the big action setpieces utilize practical effects real explosions incredible specially made vehicles and even dummies rather than cg humans when the story called for someone to kick the bucket sure there are some cg flourishes here and there and even a big sandstorm thats all effects but its always done with the weight and reality of an oldschool movie before computers took over i enjoyed story characters and the entire ride would watch again
May 25 2015,positive,an exuberant chase film which passes by extremely quickly the story is paper thin though and dialogue is very limited it constitutes a thoroughly entertaining b movie but despite the hype its no more than that
May 25 2015,negative,that was one of the worst movies ive ever watched the script writing was mediocre and almost nonexistent the only character development was mad max deciding he would need furiosa to live and visa versa the show had weird feminist undertones that seemed incredibly forced and did not fit within the film at all the entire film was just constant action with loads of insane and well done special effects its almost impossible to make even a small connection with the main characters and you feel no emotion in regards to their situation all the great special effects and good acting was wasted on something that is just incredibly disappointing
May 25 2015,negative,walked out  biggest piece of crap since i went to the zoo and saw an elephant taking a dump  someone should be shot for being allowed to make this and releasing it to the public
May 25 2015,positive,duuuuude   go see this if you like monster trucks and postapocalyptic badassery in your action packed science fiction
May 25 2015,positive,there come times in movie history where a genre defining film is created something so magnificent and grand that it forever affects the films of the future mad max fury road is a film that your grandchildren will ask if you saw it in theaters and those of us who did will be proud to tell our children yes    the movie begins with picking the audience up and placing them in the universe of mad max where packs of roving guzzoline seeking bandits and psychopaths dwell killing all who oppose them and where two headed irradiated lizards are eaten raw without a second thought the sheer deadness of the world is gorgeous and the fact that they use very little cgi brings it home when the audience sees the stunts cars flipping exploding stuntmen being thrown from them as they careen into canyon walls they see real people and vehicles too often has a overly digital set and stunts made an action movie a sterile pool of disgusting brackish water and bland characters who are either immortal or unlikable only add to it yet mad max is the opposite max and furiosa are very mortal and their peril is real max is strapped to the front of a car and driven around the desert while being used as a blood bag and furiosa comes quite near death on several occasions the enemies are made human by the addition of nux a war boy who joins the protagonists and only serves the big bad due to a religious devotion instilled in him by brainwashing the five wives are very human and compelling given varied personalities the movie despite being an action packed thrill ride makes time for subtle character development along the way    and this movie is truly a nonstop action scene perhaps fifteen minutes of its almost two hour stretch were slow and its constant adrenaline rush makes one near mad every single bit of it is george millers genius and it is truly unusual in the times of shallow plots and characters in action where stunts are fake and blows softened by the cutting of a camera    watch this movie
May 25 2015,positive,its funny for a long time i wasnt interested in mad max fury road i saw the trailers and i just wasnt buying into it i mean i thought it visually looked great but i didnt think it was going to be that good looking back i dont know what the hell i was thinking as the release got closer and the film ended up with a 99 critics score on rotten tomatoes and every critic i listen to raved about the movie then i went from zero interest to dying to see this movie i couldnt opening weekend but i finally got to see it this weekend and oh my god this is one hell of a ride mad max fury road opens with our titular hero now played by tom hardy captured and taken prisoner immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne is the leader of an almost cultfollowing civilization the movie kicks off when one of his trusted followers imperator furiosa charlize theron who is supposed to be getting gasoline from an outpost betrays him by stealing his wives and escaping joe rallies his troops to pursue them and chaos breaks out    you can read our full spoilerfree review here 
May 25 2015,negative,if i was 10 i would want hot wheels of some of the over the top vehicles the really didnt see all the depth some of the reviews are reading into the story id suggest the first two movies over this one
May 25 2015,positive,more of the same only bigger and louder oh and 3d still sucks
May 25 2015,positive,this is an instant classic in the action genre of filmmaking it is the best action film since the raid 2 in the sense that it sets the bar as to how action should be filmed it is definitely a must watch for anyone looking for an adrenaline rush
May 25 2015,positive,not alot of dialogue but enough action and interesting characters to keep me on the edge of my seat
May 25 2015,positive,amazing its the best mad max and the best movie of the year so far its great
May 25 2015,positive,super fun action movie with a crazy wild heart grab some popcorn and enjoy
May 25 2015,positive,very strange movie it keeps your interest though only thing i didnt like was some of the actors were hard to understand i recommend waiting for the dvd and watch it with subtitles
May 25 2015,negative,i didnt care much for this movie a friend and i went to see it two days ago and we both felt like people made it sound a heck of a lot better than it was the effects were terrific but the plot was kind of lame its like hey lets drive all the way out here and turn right around to go back i felt like nothing was explained well why was the earth dying why were all those people sick how did the one dude rise to power likewhat was the movie about other than giant explosions and driving across the desert the movie wasnt a total bust though the acting was good and i got a kick out of the guy playing the guitar
May 25 2015,positive,as a straight action movie its one of the best i can think of and stands as an achievement for its genre its refreshingly inventive in the visuals and in the atmosphere and the story is original though not the strongest part of the film mad max sticks to the action veering only sometimes outside of that for appropriate stake building and this leads to a film thats great action even if its still not a great movie    max gets a short introduction in the beginning of the film before it jumps directly and while the film jumps right into the action here the film wants to ditch the slow start up that action films often have and i admire that it wants to do that however it does it a little too quickly stakes are built not too far later on and i was reminded of how action is more engaging when those stakes are there still the stakeless opening 20 minutes of this film does have a visually spectacular sandstorm thats one of the most exciting moments in the film     the world that the film creates is what helps it feel fresh and original the desert postapocalyptic insanity is not something that weve seen before and mad max takes great advantage of its world much of the world building is implied through the characters actions and sets rather than told in useless exposition because of millers full realization of this world we get seemingly endless inventiveness in what happens during the action for a movie thats 75 action there is hardly any repetition people are fighting and encountering obstacles in new ways all of the time     also fun to watch are the vehicles which are rusty and handmade with neat functions and designs there is a ton of detail on them with curledup ropes cranks and pipes that each function as a part of some contraption or defense that we might not even see used during the film its this level of detail which is present throughout the film that makes us feel like the world was there long before we witnessed it    the visual design of the film is spectacular with computer effects and digital colors beautifully enhancing the film in a way that feels very modern and that represents the best of what technology can do for films and shows the world what it can do for an action film but this is not a cgi loaded movie a ton of practical effects are used with the car chases crashes and stunts all feeling very authentic its impressive when thinking about how difficult the film must have been to create but that level of ambition has certainly payed off     millers directorial style includes a frantic camera that films from a variety of angles tight and wide and is always on the move with the editing these are stitched together to create action sequences that are coherent and fast paced the use of fast and slow motion is notable because it feels like it really fits something about the film feels bmovie and 80s and yet theres so much of the film that feels so modern its a winning combination     so the action in the film is pretty much perfect but an action film cant only be action because theres a story and to not the least of my expectations the story doesnt live up to the greatness of the action    one thing that bothered me was the lack of attention to maxs character max sees flashes of flashbacks in the movie because hes haunted by people he couldnt save i was pretty sure that this was the filmmaker telling the audience that we would find out whats going on with his past and then have him overcome it but nope these were totally abandoned by the end of the film he overcomes nothing and seems to learn nothing during the film and neither does furiosa the movie gets about as deep as the word hope itself there wasnt really much heart to it either and the most emotion in this film is badassery and i dont consider that an emotion of value     so its great for action and if all you want out of a movie is action then youll get your share i found the film to be original inventive and an achievement in its genre even if i wouldnt call it great overall
May 25 2015,negative,whilst you cannot deny the thrilling nature of the action and the extremely wellcoreographed fight scenes i was waiting for something that never seemed to appear and that was the personality of max i am surprised to say that i think hardy was miscast not least as i was anticipating him being ideal for the role he is of course very physical and has huge presence but he just did not have the charisma and personality of gibsons max he seemed unable to decide on exactly what accent and tone of voice to choose too i also found myself cringing slightly at times as the overblown antics of the various lunatics on screen just seemed too forced and too throw anything at it no matter how ridiculous i never found this with the original films and i think for some reason this version just did not draw me into its weird world in the same way i just could not suspend disbelief comparisons are odious and i set out prepared to treat this as its own film but throughout i kept thinking to myself that i could have been sat at home watching the old films on bluray too much selfconscious nonsense and not enough narrative for me i caught the distinct whiff of arrogance in what seemed to be an assumption that cgi and undeniably clever photography will inevitably lead to a better film that the original
May 25 2015,positive,intense visceral perverse brutal exhilarating  mad max fury road is all of these and much more    a simple storyline without any frills or backstory the movie grabs you right from the start and doesnt let go set in a dystopian future where wars are being fought over water the movie follows imperator furiosa charlize theron as she attempts to escape from the clutches of the despotic immortan joe hugh keysbyrnes taking his harem along with her of course immortan finds out and proceeds to unleash an allout pursuit of furiosa and his harem of five wives     so where does mad max come in you may ask well the fact is that the titular max rockatansky tom hardy actually plays second fiddle in this movie it must have taken hardy a certain amount of courage to play an iconic role that ends up being secondary to that of the female protagonist the movie has a strong yet nonstrident feminist tone that does not detract from the rest of the action and seems like a very natural extension of it     the movie opens with a highoctane chase when immortan joes war boys take max captive in the citadel on finding out that he is a universal blood donor they hook him up as a blood bag to nux nicholas hoult a war boy afflicted by tumors and therefore running on halflife max still hooked up is taken along in pursuit of furiosa during which he is able to escape antagonists at first furiosa and max become allies in their quest for the green place her homeland     every highintensity chase sequence is immediately followed by a higherintensity one every time you think that it cant get any better it does every time you feel that you can now start breathing something else comes along to knock the breath out of your lungs the best part is that there is no shakycam or inyour facecam which is what passes for action nowadays the action sequences actually seem credible and effectively tread the fine line between glorious spectacle and complete insanity theres actually a pretty good reason for this  it seems that the use of cgi was kept to a minimum and stuntmen were used as far as possible     the movie is not just highoctane action and incredible pursuit vehicles the themes of freedom sacrifice and redemption form a strong emotional core for the movie stellar performances from theron hardy and hoult elevate this to much more than a mindless action flick hardys monosyllabic max is tortured by a past he cannot forget while theron is splendid as furiosa willing to kill and die for a childhood utopia she can barely remember hoult is unexpectedly able as nux in a role that calls for equal amounts of viciousness and tenderness no matter how high your expectations are believe me this movie will meet them all and then some    what a day what a lovely day
May 25 2015,positive,nonstop action and fun  insane and wild
May 25 2015,negative,they should have called it mad maxine max was reduced to baggage on this long tiresome please let it end car chase i wont be spray painting my mouth silver anytime soon i did enjoy the homage to benny hill when they sped up the footage in the tunnel scene yes it was action packed but i read some viewer reviews that said greatest movie ever son you need to see some more movies
May 25 2015,positive,definitely best movie of the year thus farwell executed rigorous  entertaining
May 25 2015,neutral,a ton of action and special effects aka michael bays wet dream   you can literally shuffle every scene but the opening one and the last one and this film would still make sense     if you want to see 110 minutes of explosions then this is the film for you     not my cup of tea i prefer more martial arts action films than seeing a 150 million dollar film with nothing but cars exploding
May 25 2015,positive,best movie of this year it was like i was watching the first mad max all over again in a good way i loved it it was an action thrill ride so much fun it was like an endless rollercoaster from start to finish its a must see
May 25 2015,positive,lot of action not much chatting didnt think we needed a remake but cant complain
May 25 2015,positive,best movie i have viewed in a long time astounded by the detail and artistry i will see it a second time in theaters
May 25 2015,positive,79  a remakesequel that really really goes for it full force in the face and in doing so largely impresses yet doesnt quite take the crown of the very best of the series which is and probably always will be mad max 2 tom hardy fills the role that mel left behind in the mid eighties though this time max hardly has more than a few lines of dialogue in the entire film but then he was never a big talker with a bulk of the attention and lines left for solely charlize therons character this is a visually epic looking film with tons of loud fast well shot action though i missed the more subtle elements of the other instalments that this doesnt have as much of plot wise this is a near remake of beyond thunderdome with a few different ideas running through some of them good some not so great in terms of allout action this is a must watch its hugely entertaining and very well made its also worthy of the mad max name which is probably its biggest accomplishment
May 25 2015,positive,being an avid fan of the classic mad max franchise i was skeptical but this was incredible a visual masterpiece george miller and co outdid themselves with fury road
May 25 2015,positive,a fking fantastic film
May 25 2015,positive,was a decent remake a little lost in the beginning but otherwise the action scenes were a thrill to watch
May 25 2015,positive,epic movie it builds perfectly on the previous mad max films furiosa is awesome as is max i like how toecutter from original road warrior was immortal joe
May 25 2015,positive,a90 movie cinema version a great action adventure movie
May 25 2015,negative,plot and characters   if you remove max from the movie nothing will change or feel lost but i guess if you call the movie furiosa no one would show up loose story when they bother to let you in on any of it sparse dialogue is understandable but when they do talk you wont care at all about what they have to say     the action   what critics are lauding as great attheedgeofyourseat type of action turns out to be extremely boring and filled with gimmicks and dystopic chase clichés after the first 15 minutes itll feel like youre watching the same 15 minutes on repeat until the movie ends     overall   halfway through i wanted to leave the theatre but wanted to wait for the movie to you know begin it didnt the most disappointing thing about it is the fanfare raises your expectations of what is at best a tuesday night bmovie
May 25 2015,positive,ok its just the same car chase for 2 hours
May 25 2015,positive,this movie is hyped on being the best of 2015people really dont have high expectations  i didnt like it other than the visuals are fun but lacks in storywhy havent they explained why the world is this waythey fight over gasoline while using it profusely as they chase each other for  2 hours boring
May 25 2015,positive,i liked this movie a lot and i do not like action movies  charlize and tom hardy had a nice meetcute outside of a rusty semitruck but unfortunately they never spoiler alert make out so no 5stars from me those would be some hot kids
May 25 2015,positive,amazing 3d  amazing stunts    ok script  some cool characters    the music was a bit much lol    way better than avengers age of ultron    âïâïâïâïout of 5 
May 25 2015,positive,umpisa pa lang parang nasa climax na sobnrang interesting characters and the entire universe more mad max im watching the old ones
May 25 2015,neutral,full of intensity but thats about all  there was
May 25 2015,positive,one of the craziest action movies ive ever seen
May 25 2015,positive,i love this movie because the theme is unique and looks like a game as well as the message of the movie is so touching  plus storyline with valhalla that reminded me with yugioh and some scenes reminded with a movie called captain phillips  so this movie made me breathless
May 25 2015,positive,simply amazing non stop action and excitement this movie is why i still love going to the movie theater certain things were unusual like the guitar playing puppet man but by the end i couldnt get enough do yourself a favor and watch this masterpiece
May 25 2015,neutral,a tumultuous car ride with some obstacles and a u turn  great special effects light on substance
May 25 2015,positive,yeeeeyyahhh ive been waiting for this for a long time and i was fricken disappointed i really expected more
May 25 2015,negative,this was the worst movie i have ever seen first time in over 10 years that after 45 minutes my husband and i walked out lots of action very little dialogue or set up couldnt figure out what was going on 45 min into the movie
May 25 2015,positive,great action film  tom hardy and charlize theron are terrific the visuals are stunning and stunts incredible the post punk apocalyptic villains improve upon the villains from the earlier films
May 25 2015,positive,dang this epic film by george miller is setting the bar in a ton of ways hard to imagine star wars living up to this film well see    watch mad max fury road in the theaters i think a lot of people myself included are gonna watch this one multiple times in the theater
May 25 2015,negative,i think this is one of the worst movies i have seen for a while its just plain boring
May 25 2015,positive,thats what reboot movie should be
May 25 2015,positive,loved the nonsensical 80s vibe and found the crazy spectacle fascinating yet i cant imagine ever putting myself through it again
May 25 2015,positive,ust got back from mad max  fury road   just a short review  loved it   super caffeinated quad shot awesomeness  seriously i was looking over my shoulder after this one     i think this movie had every element that i hoped  great cinematics perfectly cast and heart wrenching   i debated this rating with my son  who hearing me gush about it asked why i couldnt give this a five cup  well it only falls short of rearranging my molecules by soooo much  for example lord of the rings star wars  when that ship flies over head for the first time in 1976 it changed you   and more recently inception  that one had me spinning dreidels  for two weeks after i first saw it    so max falls just short of those noble company indeed    charlize theron is just amazing  the depth of the script isnt high because there really isnt a lot of dialogue during this movie   youre fighting baddies and its not easy  so the actors are forced to communicate through expression and charlize blew that away tom hardy did equally as well playing a psychotic antihero and interestingly played in inception as well yet is unrecognizable in this one    see it in imax if you cani wish i did  see more at   
May 25 2015,positive,best action film of the last 20 years hands down visually stunning breathtaking action batshiz crazy loved it can i see it again 20 times
May 25 2015,positive,nonstop action from start to finishmost worthy of taking over the madmax franchiseloved it
May 24 2015,positive,not a dull moment and the characters were worth watching
May 24 2015,positive,it was different could have been better action was good but the story line was ok
May 24 2015,positive,i cannot emphasize enough how much i loved this movie visualizations where astounding acting was perfectly executed plot was actually surprisingly well done and thought out for an action flick and although i am the last person to identify as a feminist or weigh in on the gender dynamics within this film i will say this theron hardy and hoult are all equally badass characters and on par with each other throughout the entirety of this beautiful thrill ride     105
May 24 2015,positive,well made but just not my cup of tea
May 24 2015,positive,i can honestly say i saw stuff here ive never seen in any other movie  the weird butte society the milking women the sandstorm car chase  rather spectacular
May 24 2015,positive,perfect in most aspects mad max fury road is a musical ballet of madly made brilliance the music sound effects practical and special effects and of course the action are all perfect    the character depth along with the story was good and present but could have been more explained this movie in specification didnt need a large plot but every movie needs to explain its existence subtle or not in this movie it didnt addressed it in all the film is amazing 910
May 24 2015,positive,a very creative adrenaline pumping action movie with unbelievable special effects and overthetop characters
May 24 2015,positive,the premise is basically an escapeescort story where the characters are driving along a long stretch of post apocalyptic road while many fleets of murderous crazy maniacs are on their tale to murder them most people in this world are past the balance of sanity madness is the normal temperament of the majority even the antiheroes there are no straight up heroes the stunts the visuals  even character arcs and motives were pretty clear in this kind of film which is impressive given that this film is basically 90 action thrill ride i was hypnotized by the world that was presented this film is pure awesomeness
May 24 2015,positive,mad max returns to earn 4 stars out of 5 fury road the beginning of this movie shows us a broken haunted hunted max we havent seen before and then the action insanely kicks in and doesnt really stop too long during the next 2 hours some argue that therons imperator furiousa is the center of this film and i agree she has a crucial large role played to near perfection but make no mistake it is another of maxs adventures we thrill to tom hardy again accomplishes a lot without much dialogue and director george miller rewards audiences who have longed for a return to the max universe sure it may seem crazy when you hear us talk about the cirque du soleil feel to many moments in the film just wait until you see them there are nods to prior films toecutter is immortan joe and such an unbelievable energy to this installment that youll want to be rigged up for more max when it ends just not strung up like he endures best movie that opened in may this year by far
May 24 2015,positive,action packed adventure excellent acting from charlize a bit of a weakstoryline would have loved to hear more about max background
May 24 2015,negative,i really dont understand the hype i knew nothing about it going in my boyfriend wanted to see it and i thought i might enjoy it i ended up being so uninterested i fell asleep for a while about half an hour in and once i woke up was so painfully bored i left the theater to sit in the lobby while my bf finished the show  the lobby was more entertaining
May 24 2015,positive,amazing movie  i wished charlize theron had more role than she did
May 24 2015,negative,the shortest most accurate description i can come up with for this film is driving to  from burning man with a spot of car trouble  everyone is dirty and searching for water in their epically built machines going to someplace and ending up where they started off  while the setting is great and the acting is decent the plotbyexplosion failed to keep my attention for more than the first 15 minutes  after that i just wanted them to be captured so i could get an escape from the nonstop explosion    while i am in awe over the incredible machines built for this film the film turns into one massive car chase without any staying power or interesting events  i feel like this is a fairly well done michael bay film it even has the stereotypical stare at the super model scene reminiscent of when megan fox is standing over bumblebee in transformers    why george why  i thought you were going to be above that  maybe even put in some dialog instead of grunting just a thought  witness me is one of the longer dialog sequences in this film luckily its repeated a number of times  i witnessed you im writing this review to let anyone who isnt interested in watching a burning man traffic report know that they can skip this film
May 24 2015,positive,this movie totally kicked my ass with how great it was
May 24 2015,positive,like its predecessors this show is now the new benchmark of badass tom hardy nailed it im almost glad gibson didnt reprise his roll maxs history seemed to have been tweak but as long time fan of the franchise it quickly disappeared into the perpetual sand clouds and fiery exhaust the camera work effects sound fell of grit story pacing sweat and carnage all meld together to form a sweet symphony of destruction charlize theron can now join the ranks of sigourney weaver and linda hamilton as certified badasses the fact that i can possibly criticize the show after the fact is evidence to how much it pulls you in and warps you in a blanket of suspended disbelief the only thing i really would have like to see was a closer ending to match its earlier installments
May 24 2015,positive,this movie is beyond just beyond it shows how to do everything right that michael bay does wrong
May 24 2015,positive,great action movie much better than mel gibson version strap on seat belt   non stop action from beginning to end it was so good that i watched it twice very seldom for me to watch any movie more than once recommend the 3d version other than violence it is watchable for kids
May 24 2015,positive,better than expected
May 24 2015,positive,i live i die i live again shiny and chrome witness
May 24 2015,positive,so good it made my face hurt
May 24 2015,negative,poorly done remakea real stinker
May 24 2015,positive,the popcorn feast which is mad max fury road go see it to believe it
May 24 2015,positive,pure enthralling action and entertainment
May 24 2015,positive,exciting beautiful thrilling inspiring mad max manages to do all of these things
May 24 2015,positive,a movie that i cant recommend to anyone but have to recommend to everyone    only complaint was there were times when i did feel that they should have turned down the disgusting imagery i wasnt disgusted but i was distracted
May 24 2015,positive,miller still has an eye for action and this doesnt dissapoint on that aspect of the movie it starts with a hell of an opening and keeps it going after a brief speech with a car chase which those just get better throughout the entire movie where it does falter a bit is with max given ive seen all the other mo is so i didnt need an introduction to him or what hes been through but for this it felt like max was a side character in his own movie with theron taking the spot light which she does well a good action packed movie though worth checking out
May 24 2015,positive,this movie was extremely entertaining easily the best of the series
May 24 2015,negative,overall a bad movie the mad max movies from the 1980s portrayed max as a somewhat mysterious and haunted driven for revenge because of the death of his family set in post apocalyptic australia the land is arid bereft of water and vegetation it was a struggle a fight for gasoline and for water two commodities in short supply max found himself in the middle of this struggle and used his wits to survive before resuming a life of isolation at the conclusion   of the movie fast forward 30 years to fury road and the questions are why max is tethered to a war boy by a blood supply line during a chase in the desert why do the war boys spray silver paint into their mouths  what is the background life of the concubines who are fleeing from the antagonist and ruler in this rendition of mad max what is the background of furiosa played by charlize theron this movie was high on visual effects and incredibly short on story or even a capable narrator to guide the viewer throughout i wouldnt call it boring but the chase scenes become redundant after the first 30 minutes what is the point of this story that furiosa is an equal gladiator of sorts to mad max if you figure this out bravo and kudos to you for following it from beginning to end
May 24 2015,positive,jaw dropping and astonishing fury road brings back director george miller and with him the insane excellence of the previous mad max films
May 24 2015,positive,a great sequel to mad max good plot good story most awesome action i love the world they created in this installment ill say no more see this movie
May 24 2015,negative,one of the most grotesque pointless movies in hollywood history  probably one of worst 5 movies i have ever seen
May 24 2015,negative,i felt as if the movie wasnt a very good way to bring back mad max the movie made men out to be these horrible people that use women for sex and tried to have female main character act like a strong women in order to make them look good     the movie just pushed the feminist agenda way to much and it ruined the movie for me not to mention max hardly had as much screen time as he should have had he didnt even really feel like the main character when he is meant to be just that
May 24 2015,positive,amazing kept the feeling of the old movies
May 24 2015,positive,visually amazing  great action and score probably one of the best action movies i seen in years top notch acting
May 24 2015,positive,kept me interesting most of the time never seen a movie like this before
May 24 2015,negative,the look of the film is solid but thats about it everything else is just boring what we have here is two action packed hours thats paired with a weak thereandbackagain plot
May 24 2015,positive,wow so true to the look and feel of what mad max should be very little dialogue and yet a story in the non stop action
May 24 2015,negative,my husband and i took my 13 year old son to see this movie based upon my husband looking at the rotten tomatoes ratings  i guess you have to be a real heavy mad max fan to enjoy this movie  it was one continuous action scene with minimal dialogue  truly how many times can you watch battle between cars within a 25 hour period  we could not wait for the movie to end  my 13yearold said he didnt find it as bad as we did
May 24 2015,negative,i will give it 5 stars for the action makeup and costumes it felt like a great fantasy but there is no story really boring the actors that played maybe spoke a few sentences through out the whole movie  accept the action you dont really get what the hell is the story here  thats why i gave it only 2 stars
May 24 2015,positive,epic explosive adrenalinefueled heavymetal dessert ride
May 24 2015,positive,just when you think its given you everything it gives more
May 24 2015,positive,absolutely nuts and a visual and auditory spectacle anyone who saw a trailer for this movie got an idea of what they were in for when coming in to see mad max fury road few viewers besides the most ardent of fans will remember or perhaps even alive when the last film came out three decades ago but fury road will surely push them to dig up that one and retrace the history of the series    tom hardy and charlize theron both are fantastic and the action scenes are fun and exciting to watch however any attempt to fully describe the experience of watching mad max is in for an impossible task just watch it    in my first viewing while i had some appreciation for the emotional heart of the film it didnt hit as hard for me as it apparently did for others however after giving it another go i came to grasp the heart and the message one of the most entertaining watches in a whileguitar riff
May 24 2015,positive,this movie is a pure unadulterated shot of awesome it has some pretty disturbing parts that i wont spoil but thats all part of the show
May 24 2015,negative,im not going to totally rag on this movie but i will say that unless you want to see a movie with absolutely no plot just people driving around blowing each other up and shooting at each other then go see this movie i dont really like the fast and the furious either so perhaps if you like those movies youll like mad max fury road but ill also tell you that at least in the fast and furious theyre driving around in really nice cars
May 24 2015,negative,mad max was not as good as i thought it would be  it was loud and had a real rock and roll post apocalyptic theme which was cool but the over all plot really sucked  it was all action and absolutely zero story    i stuck it through the entire movie and the ending was anticlimactic i wish i had seen something else
May 24 2015,positive,talk about action packed i like the fact that it didnt have that much of a story line but it definitely never made u loose interest
May 24 2015,positive,never ending action  awesome
May 24 2015,positive,just saw with the wife i think i need something to lower my blood pressure after that crazy ride
May 24 2015,positive,the best part about this movie is the fact that they used actual cars and and actual stunts which is a rare sight in this cgi infused world i really enjoyed this movie i am a big fan of dystopia and action and this movie was an excellent combination of the two whatalovelyday
May 24 2015,positive,if you can get past some of the oddities of mad max you will absolutely love fantasticly put together it will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire movie it leaves you craving more
May 24 2015,positive,surprisingly layered in its story without heft in exposition fury road takes the series to a refreshingly entertaining rebirth characters have depth while motivation bridges the story together subtext coats the rich world without preaching and action contextualizes the narrative without weighing it down in chaos    it is one of the few achievements in filmmaking where everything is the result of meticulous preparation not simply postproduction fixing the messups of principle photography every shot every cut every line has purpose and it sums it up into a film greater than its parts easily one of the best summer action films in a long time
May 24 2015,negative,lost two hours of my life ill never get back
May 24 2015,positive,with its poetic visuals wellchoreographed chase sequences and mind boggling stunts veteran filmmaker george miller may have crafted quite possibly the best action film in a decade mad max fury road sets the bar so high as the film to beat this summer     miller has demonstrated that summer action films do not have to be throwaway mindless entertainment he did not sacrifice art for financial gain the best films are those that do not take the weekend title of 1 grossing film there are no residual plush toy sales involved cinephiles could care less about all of that    the action scenes are exhilarating without being repetitious the cgi adds dramatic heft to the narrative and does not become overbearing and in a film about dystopia the humor is well placed
May 24 2015,positive,i cant say i have been really following the story line if such there is one with mad max movies i lost the plot after the second visually stunning but weirdly detached movie that stemmed from the original so i dont really get the whole postapocalyptic thing with mad max if you took mad max out of the title it becomes a visually appealing and stunning action fest  but it is a little confusing when this movie tries to mesh elements of earlier movies including the all too brief return of the interceptor   if it is action and not substance that drives you then you are in for a ridemate so buckle up for me none of it made much sense and who is this grunting lizard eating actor masquerading as max the star of the show was charlize without doubt   this movies tries to win the hearts of too many people tries too hard to satisfy the action junkie ends up making me feel more depressed longing for some sanity in the mad max world  do you remember the original movie do you remember the excitement that welled inside you as max drove out of that garage in that black interceptor seeking revenge i sure do the camera angles of that car on the road the fury in his eyes the atmosphere of the original so breathtaking and so well done   not much atmosphere here just hopelessness and desolation   perhaps it is unfair and probably not even necessary to compare mel gibsons mad max original to this one they are extremely different movies  i loved the fantasy laden highly customised  cars and trucks in the movie i cant work out why the peasants were there and why they cannibalized their leader  i cant work out why his servants where painted white and bald and had chrome paint sprayed into their mouths i cant work out why charlize swiped grease on her brow no one said anything about how she lost an arm and when she tore the face of that ugly guy and said remember me there is no reference to it in the storyline as to why she would   all in all a tremendous mash up of half baked characters with hints of a story that go nowhere and do nothing nowhere near the classic original but as a standalone action flick pretty good
May 24 2015,positive,a funfilled ride from start to finish
May 24 2015,positive,loved it would watch again any time
May 24 2015,positive,it was definitely actionpacked but i couldnt really get behind the story and other than charlize wasnt jazzed about the cast i definitely need to go back and rewatch the original
May 24 2015,positive,bad ass the whole way through
May 24 2015,positive,mad max aka bad ass to the bone
May 24 2015,neutral,an all action movie i think that the movie should be named after the girl and not mad max i felt that she had way more influence over everything the movie was very entertaining but a little bit longer for what i should have been
May 24 2015,positive,was so intense i had to take a threehour nap when i got home easily the loudest most overstimulating and psychotic film ive ever seen totally loved it
May 24 2015,positive,octane adrenaline and flaming cars everywhere eye candy
May 24 2015,positive,great visuals  that never bored me at allsetup is there for a prequelsequel
May 24 2015,positive,best action movie ever  this movie is filled with raging amounts of awesome  dont wait for it to be on video see it in the theatre  the small screen just isnt enough
May 24 2015,positive,awesome movie this remake is a must see
May 24 2015,positive,violent as hell and extremely entertaining definitely worth seeing
May 24 2015,positive,this was literally one of the best movies ive ever seen its as good as some of the best action movies ever made terminator 2 road warrior die hard this stands with them and may even be better i love this so much those who find the story lacks are missing the more subtle aspects of it this is a deep movie and deserves multiple viewings top notch in all aspects perfect in my opinion nothing that comes out these days can compare to this my favorite action movie since the dark knight
May 24 2015,positive,movie was exatly what i thought it would be  love it  just accept the crazy plot lines and enjoy the ride
May 24 2015,positive,stunning visuals make this movie a must see for action fans the car chase scenes are exhilarating and it feels as if the plot moves along well enough one of my favorite things about this movie is the lack of exposition you can get a feel for the story without being told directly what happens its a little bit of a thinker in that you have to connect the dots but its definitely not complicated a fun movie throughout i would absolutely recommend
May 24 2015,positive,overall this is a decent film but by no means a perfect film like everybody has been saying while the story itself is well written the technical failings namely the inconsistent frame rate are too much of a distraction to make the film enjoyable     it also expects you to be already familiar with the world of mad max as this isnt so much a reboot as it is a loose continuation kind of like superman returns if you like the franchise you have probably already seen this film but if you arent a die hard fan then dont pay full price to see this because its not worth the headache you get from the choppy cinematography    full review 
May 24 2015,negative,for the life of mefail to see how this movie attained such high marksvisually yes it is spectacular but it seemed like oneextremely long chase scene nothing elseto me
May 24 2015,positive,loud crashy explosive violent but also grandly epic and operatic underneath the heavy metal horror is something like genius loved the sparse dialogue â about two dozen complete sentences in the whole film theron is wonderful
May 24 2015,positive,this movie is insane
May 24 2015,positive,this movie was just a really great intense action scene all the way through 5 âïâïâï
May 24 2015,positive,you know a movies good when all you wanna do is be in the world it built even when its the worst version of the world possible
May 24 2015,positive,production values were great but i struggled to find much of a plot or a reason to care while watching this film it kept me entertained but i dont know that i will have any reason to add this to my bluray collection
May 24 2015,positive,yes i know its an action movie but stillmy movie review rant lol  mad maxwhile tom hardening has a knack for playing brooding characters warrior he was clearly eclipsed by charlize theron in this film  arguably charlize theron seemed to be the true protagonist of the film and in fact carried this movie i have no doubt this would have been a much better film and story had her character been overtly central from the beginning rather than the protagonist behind the protagonist perhaps movie moguls were afraid to alienate fans of the original maledominated storyline but that fear hurt this movie in my opinion when you have an acting talent such as theron on boardtake full advantage of it    this is not a movie with a lot of dialogue so as expected action scenes dominate this movie but for me it is those brief moments of dialogue and those magical moments of nonverbal closeups on characters that are crucial to the story line and allow you to connect to the inner turmoil of the characters  up until charlize therons character comes to life on the screen halfway thru the movie the story is relatively dry some actors have that uncanny ability to speak a thousand words thru their eyes mel gibson original mad max movies has that ability and charlize theron has that ability in this movie however i didnt get that from tom harding in this film rather he seemed disconnected from his character throughout the movie  this was surprising considering his great performance in warrior   in my opinion an actor should be able to connect with the audience even if they are playing a disconnected characterthats the magicto that end i should mention the very tangible and almost quantifiable performance of  nicholas hoult in this film    im not a fan of 3d and seeing this film in 3d unfortunately didnt change my opinion you still dont get that wraparound affect that would create a truly immersional experience and the colors are never as vibrant and crisp as in non3d movies im still waiting to be surprisedhopefully in my lifetime    disclaimer im a fan of charlize theron shes an excellent and seasoned actress willing to step up to the plate and show true acting chops in movies like monster for which she won an academy award im also a fan of mel gibson so perhaps tom harding just had big shoes to fill
May 24 2015,positive,a great ride of action this has some of the best chase sequences i have ever seen i really enjoyed the music in this as well this is arguably the best mad max movie
May 24 2015,negative,great graphicnovelesque cinematography otherwise pretty nonsensical and one dimensional
May 24 2015,negative,where can i give this movie 0 points
May 24 2015,negative,pointless and boring  a for effort on gratuitous violence no story they just went there and back
May 24 2015,negative,is everyone who gave this movie over two stars on crack one of the worst movies ive ever had to sit through there was no story no character development wish i could ask for a refund ugh wait for the dvd
May 24 2015,positive,top movies of 2015  2    what i never saw coming was the powerhouse that was mad max fury road from its exhilarating soundtrack to his fantastic special effects that dont abuse its cgi and is in fact mostly practical which adds a level of rawness and its two amazing leads in furiosa and mad max this movie is definitely an action packed and explosive joy ride from beginning to end theres so many cool moments in this movie from the guitar flamethrower guy to the spear throwing self chroming war boys and the asskicking furiosa this is the action genre at its finest
May 24 2015,positive,overly hyped yes popcorn action fun yes
May 24 2015,positive,the storyline was pretty good there were some parts in the movie that werent explained and personally i dont think that max himself didnt get enough screen time
May 24 2015,positive,abosolutely perfect
May 24 2015,positive,talk about road rage theron and hardy make a good pairing in this loud but visionary dystopian nonstop road warrior chase scene a good revival of the franchise
May 24 2015,positive,not as good a the first one
May 24 2015,positive,dont let anyone tell you that this movie is feminist propaganda just because a movie had a strong female lead doesnt make it that there are really human emotions throughout this masterpiece every character is multi dimensional and complex some critics where hoping for a movie with the protagonist leading every aspect of the story however what they got was a accurate portrait of survival power sexuality and ingenuity the next argument is that people wanted a origin story really everyone knows how max came to be so they skipped forplay and dived into what everyone wanted to see
May 24 2015,positive,heavy on quality action sequences and light on character development or a particularly intriguing storyline entertaining nonetheless but 98 no
May 24 2015,positive,action packed beautifully executed
May 24 2015,negative,no characters to follow  no story to get interested in  just a crap shoot of action
May 24 2015,positive,the perfect kind of mad
May 24 2015,positive,savegewasteland scifi thriller so demential as previous performed by mel gibsonthe car chases are scpectacularenough to make ff fairies stuffone of best summer 2015
May 24 2015,neutral,tom hardy has nothing on mel gibson otherwise it was good not great but worth watching
May 24 2015,neutral,max was just a tag along for this film  it felt as hal needham was directing this film without the humor  lets have a road race with very little plot and a lot of car crashes
May 24 2015,positive,i am genuinely surprised by how much i enjoyed this film but it was packed with superb stunts high octane speed chases and fuelled by a fantastic soundtrack that really roused the fightin spirit i highly recommend it
May 24 2015,positive,oh my god what a phenomenal movie great stunts action every moment great complying characters dark feel amazing story guy with a guitar that shoot s fire out everything i wanted in this movie loved the 3 old mad max movies this one blew all of them away highly recommend this movie my favorite movie so far of 2015 i had a blast and great acting george miller one of my favorite director s im buying this in a blue ray steel book no dough     and worth its five stars
May 24 2015,negative,saw this movie and actually found myself falling asleep during the movie i am dumbfounded by all the critical acclaim the movie is getting it was at times ridiculous and tom hardy  wow he was terrible in this movie
May 24 2015,positive,now words can truly describe this master piece 1010
May 24 2015,positive,great movie lots of action
May 24 2015,positive,this was one of the most exciting movies ive seen in a long time
May 24 2015,positive,lots of dumb fun action brainless but not for lack of trying its all about the visuals
May 24 2015,positive,awesome nonstop action thrill ride edge of the seat stuff lost half a star due to tom hardys stupid voice
May 24 2015,neutral,mad max    my dads opinion the original was better but still fun and enjoyable    my opinion i didnt see the original but it was enjoyable and it had its moments 3d wasnt bad either
May 24 2015,positive,great performances from tom hardy and charlize theron  plus george miller at his best
May 24 2015,negative,this movie had no business using the the name mad max  it was 99 charlize theron and tom hardy just happened to be there  nowhere near the caliber as the original trilogy and thats saying something with the technology available today  pass on this movie unless you enjoy being duped into thinking your gonna see a mad max film and realize 20 minutes in that you are watching   a chick flick
May 24 2015,positive,i never rate a movie this high but for this over the top movie i will its all about bullets blood and bones lots of wild cars and plenty of fighting character all over the place and none of it makes sense i loved this movie
May 24 2015,negative,lots of action but no story after 45 minutes of this film i climbed over the seats to leave i found it painful to sit through this movie i have never been to such a bad movie
May 24 2015,negative,nonstop action from beginning to end somehow i thought with the highly rated critic reviews they had made this more realistic or interesting than the older mad max movies they didnt
May 24 2015,positive,the best movie ever
May 24 2015,positive,george miller really does make you want to jump in the movie and tell the actors wha they should and should not do great soundtrack great acting and most of all the scenery in this movie is out of this world not is this just a action packed monster but it also shows the background of the characters throughout the entire movie highly entertaining and one of the best movies of the year enjoy
May 24 2015,positive,easily the best action movie in the last decade gotta see it in theatres twice
May 24 2015,positive,such an awesome high octane movie
May 24 2015,negative,this was horrible  no redeeming qualities at all
May 24 2015,positive,fascinating action sequences as well as very exceptional acting performances by the cast are what earned this film only three stars for me the title of the film and the center of the franchise is suppose to be following the life of mad max in an apocalyptic world but this film loses sight of that and you even begin to wonder if max is even the main character i dont doubt that tom hardy could have pulled off the character but he wasnt given the chance as charlize theron steals the show overall the film would have been better if it had followed what is suppose to be the main character of the franchise less furiosa would have made for a better film still entertaining
May 24 2015,positive,nonstop from beginning to end never lets up in its pacing but still feels fresh
May 24 2015,negative,shocking   what storyline   mel gibson with his soul removed  car bodies on truck chassis and massive super charged engines towing tankers but supposedly no petrol omg
May 24 2015,positive,great movie but would have liked to see more emphasis put into max and less in sharice theron
May 24 2015,positive,good action  pretty cool movie
May 24 2015,positive,better than the originals
May 24 2015,positive,great action sequences just not a whole lot of plot or dialog
May 24 2015,positive,thrill a minute thrill ride with more depth and character than the latest superhero movie
May 24 2015,positive,goddamnit it was awesome so superbly awesome action movie as art its been a while since ive seen something as glorious as this on screen
May 24 2015,positive,it was differently good im not used to this type of movies with so many weirds details but i guess thats what makes the movie special love the guitarman playing the whole time
May 24 2015,positive,believe the hype best action film ive seen and still managed to get a good story delivered bring on wasteland
May 24 2015,positive,if youre looking for something cerebral this movie aint it  if youre looking for mindless nonstop action and silly thrills this movie has everything you need in buckets  its a two hour long postapocalyptic car chase that plays out like the demented love child of cirque du soleil and a monster truck rally
May 24 2015,positive,mad max fury road breathes new life into and uterlly dull franchise the fourth installment continues to be on par with the originals with its lack of storyline and character development but it excells in all other areas the film is completely insane with stunning visuals and amazimg sound the action is intense and nonstop from the very beginning the film is so unique and so crazy that it is unlike any other action flick
May 24 2015,positive,theres a plot but you dont need one with a v8 engine shot up your ass  the director keeps the pedal to the floor and drives it like he stole it  then he drops the mic
May 24 2015,positive,regardless of their impressive action sequences and massive influence on the postapocalyptic action genre i saw the first three mad max films as nothing but poorly written horribly acted campy garbage especially the insufferable mad max beyond thunderdome therefore it was really surprising to see how critics and audiences around the world bowed down before the fourth installment of george millers franchise and not in vain mad max fury road is instantly one of the best films of 2015 that sweeps the floor not only with the first three films but also with every other action spectacle of the year so far mainly furious 7 and avengers age of ultron the film is pure mayhem from start to finish with a few welcome breathing spaces in between and just enough character development great action requires nothing more or less than ferocious intensity combined with technological wizardry and a human element and miller understands this better than anyone certainly better than the makers of furious 7 more conservative viewers may find it frustrating that the character of max is often sidetracked into a supporting role while charlize therons furiosa gets the spotlight but the claims about the film being some kind of feminist statement are ridiculous the world of fury road is a hellhole where people are perfectly willing to tear each other to bits to survive regardless of gender theron and tom hardy are a perfect match for each other hardys laconic presence beats mel gibsons wooden posturing any time and theron provides the film the needed human element in addition to many fantastic fight scenes nicholas hoult hams it up in the best possible way and hugh keaysbyrne who also played toecutter in the first film is much more sinister this time mad max fury road is the best action film seen since the raid redemption two hours of pure adrenaline rush that feels like an hour shorter it is also the first film of the series to live up to the word mad
May 24 2015,negative,the original was better
May 24 2015,positive,loved it excellent movie
May 24 2015,positive,im sure someone else has told you about this film
May 24 2015,positive,great stunts and visuals
May 24 2015,positive,lots of action kinda of reminded me of a live action film of borderlands
May 24 2015,positive,happy fleet  my review of mad max fury road 5 stars    bleak grim pummeling infuriating exhausting and too loud mad max fury road despite those negatives is an undeniable visceral thrilling relentlessly inventive and exciting masterpiece within the action genre  george millers 1981 film the road warrior the second part of his max rockatansky story has been and still remains my favorite action film of all time but fury road feels like the film in which technology has finally caught up with what has been in millers head all these years in between      replacing mel gibson in the title role tom hardy barely utters a word yet brings a crazed but soulful tone to the table  like its predecessor the film is set in a post apocalyptic desert where the sword is definitely mightier than the pen  with gasoline and water precious commodities max is captured by goons who bring him back to their tyrannical leader immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne joes vertical kingdom enslaves the masses and doles out water here and there to provide a glimmer of hope      joe keeps a bevy of beautiful women at his disposal for breeding but everything goes wrong when imperator furiosa charleze theron veers off from a gas run with the women stashed away in her rig  a chase ensues pretty much for the rest of the films running time where max who is being used as a human hood ornament and blood bag joins forces with furiosa to escape to furiosas childhood home the green place andor destroy joe and his gang      despite max being heavily involved with most of the action this feels more like therons film and she carries it magnificently  completely understanding millers brand of existential dread theron glowers with conviction and with her mechanical arm and crazy fighting skills she joins aliens ripley in the pantheon of great female action heroes  joining max and furiosa on their journey is nux an unrecognizable nicholas hoult one of joes warriors who may or may not prove to be a useful ally to our heroes  its a manic outthere exciting performance and fits perfectly into millers universe    and what a vision it is  cinematographer john seale no stranger to desert landscapes with his stunning oscarwinning work on the english patient surpasses himself here with mastery in every single shot  messing with frame rates and color saturation this is a jawdropping spectacle the camera seems to be in the right and most dynamic place at all times maximizing the overall impact of the film  margaret sixels sharp editing jenny beavans wild and glorious costume design and the deathdefying stunt work all contribute to millers singular vision  green screens and cables or not the sight of those war boys flying around on those bendable poles is indelible      the mad max world is all about kinetics and the desperation of survival  its a tough unforgiving existence one that may not appeal to moviegoers expecting a retread of millers happy feet or babe  long before those hits miller staked his claim as a singular auteur of action films  you felt every grunt every effort every troubled soul trying to stay alive as they seek out a happier place while careening out of control in their soupedup vehicles      fury road at times feels like a monster truck rally complete with a crazy guitarist strapped to the hood of a rig providing a noisy soundtrack above the already earsplitting din  if youre not a fan of this type of assault this isnt for you  for everyone else and i suspect thats a large crosssection of the world fury road is an electric jolt  its prologue alone garnered huge applause from the typically unimpressed writers guild audience  one can easily relate to the feel of this movie what with isis brutally carving a medieval swath across the middle east or with kim jong un and his thugs torturing and starving his own people in a mercilessly enforced cult of personality regime  all of these themes were present in the original films but current events make fury road resonate that much more  i left this film exhausted yet thrilled by its ability to sustain such an aweinspiring pace from start to finish
May 24 2015,positive,maybe just a tad overrated this franchise obviously never was primarily about taut storylines and profound characters but i would say road warrior and thunderdome both had greater charm at the end of this fourth movie i feel as though i know and care about max less than i had previously  they certainly did oneup the physical production values and that does count for something it was at least worth going to the theater to experience with just a few obvious cg frames that id say detracted from more than enhanced the picture
May 24 2015,positive,an action flick with a real story line and a moral tale to tell
May 24 2015,negative,this movie is boring i fell asleep a couple of times before it was over no plot no character development mad max doesnt even talk and is reduced to some kind of an idiot who is good behind the wheel the bad guys are a bunch of clay pigeons whose only purpose is to die in a variety of incredible and gruesome ways the problem is that as a viewer i dont really hate the bad guys nor do i care about the good guys because there is no character development so i end up being bored by all the action because ive seen it all in so many other movies i honestly dont understand how this mediocre b quality movie received so much critical acclaim i feel cheated out of my 30
May 24 2015,positive,a masterclass in action filmmaking a prime example of visual storytelling that really requires no volume to understand although you want volume and a lot of it to savor the exquisitely executed crashes explosions and stuntwork
May 24 2015,negative,if i were still a kid  though car crashes  gratuitous explosions were the height of cinema this may have been my thing but since thats all it really is  ive developed a taste for entertainment beyond such fare i feel like it was a waste of good money  time
May 24 2015,positive,a breathless action masterpiece an unforgettable moviegoing experience a visually stunning wasteland dervish the list goes on and on
May 24 2015,positive,one of the best movie i have seen in the past decade
May 24 2015,negative,i saw this movie last night and i honestly thought we were punked by the critics  five of us went and 5 of us lthought it was one of the worst movies weve ever seen
May 24 2015,positive,its a good action movie but there is no depth and it begins to get boring after the first hour  action sequences are key to a movie like this and though they start off great the end just didnt excite  the final scene was appropriate
May 24 2015,positive,this was an actionpacked movie with a lot of wicked vehicles and explosions  i wanted more out of it though  i left feeling a little unsatisfied
May 24 2015,positive,i had no expectations when going into this movie and was blown away 1st 20 mins may have been a touch slow but after that its an amazing ride
May 24 2015,positive,mad mad  fury road is that rare thing these days it a a supremely entertaining largely cgifree action film which is a blast from start to finish tom hardy is certainly no mel gibson but to be fair hes not really given that much to do this is more charlize therons story and she is excellent in it   the plot is fairly paper thin but the action on screen is simply breathtaking beautifully shot and truly jaw dropping some moments nearly brought screams of joy from myself and it was  joy to see real practical stunts   its fantastic my favorite  film of the year so far and a sure contender for action film of the year
May 24 2015,negative,horrible silly story no plot overdose of violence nothing related to the real mad max trilogy do not wast your money and time
May 24 2015,positive,one of the best films ive ever seen truly a game changer
May 24 2015,negative,perhaps one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life i am stunned at the amount of people that enjoyed this movie with a plot that anyone can see coming like a bad dream 2 hours i will never get back i am sorry but the nipple sucking fat cows providing breast milk for the king to drink is just way to much
May 24 2015,positive,george millers epic mad max film had a lot of sand which added to the grittiness of a film that was all action from intro to credits
May 24 2015,positive,mindblowing visuals and action couldnt have wanted for a better mad max
May 24 2015,positive,one wild ride wow and hardy does a good job channeling the original maxs gibson mannerisms overall just a visual buffet of madness
May 24 2015,negative,i was so disappointed in this movie  yes there are great special effects but to me there wasnt much of a story  it was like one long fight scene on a truck  i am glad others liked it and it may have been that this was rated so highly by both the critics and the audience that my expectations were just too high
May 24 2015,positive,if youre prepared to watch this movie for what it is a movie that stays true to the mad max series and is full of mind blowing stunts then you will leave very happy
May 24 2015,positive,if you thought the chase scenes were the best part of the road warrior you are going to love this
May 24 2015,positive,i didnt expect this movie to be so good i thought it was just a stupid action movie with a bunch of crazy dudes finding over gasoline it is much more than that i love the movie great plot and cast all the scenes are beautiful
May 24 2015,positive,loved it from first to last minutecant fault it in any waytom hardy is always good and the supporting cast are all excellentbut the real star is australiaif this doesnt win the oscar for best cinematography there is no justice
May 24 2015,positive,when critics review a movie and the approval rating is a whopping 98 i take this very seriously as in a mustsee movie  easily one of the best action movies ive ever seen and definitely my vote for the best movie of 2015 so far  charlize theron is brilliant in this film  not a lot of dialogue but unbelievable action  i absolutely loved it  i talked people into seeing it because of their hesitation of the 80s classic and everyone was satisfied beyond belief and actually needed a cigarette afterwards
May 24 2015,positive,a masterpiece a roller coaster of a film
May 24 2015,positive,just amazing i was so excited the whole movie
May 24 2015,positive,this movie has given me hope for the action genre of my time  lets start of with the fact that we got to witness a butt ugly guy in a red unitard jamming on a fire spewing guitar while hanging mid air on a moving vehicleif that does not tickle your fancy you are not worthy to watch the great acting sported by charlize theron and tom hardy  i am not getting into any plot elements as there are many other sources to consult however if you are a fan of the action genre and have been worried about the integrity of modern day action films look no further as mad max has become a film others can aspire to   i will without a doubt get this on bluray but its definitely worth going to the cinemas to see
May 24 2015,negative,very bad copy of mad max ii the road warrior no argument story  plus tom hardy doesnt fit half of mel gibsons shoes bad remake
May 24 2015,positive,because most reviews for mad max fury road have been overloaded with raves i have a feeling the tone of my review will sound a bit harsh its kind of a natural reaction when you hear nothing but positives to focus on the negatives particularly when youre not blown away by the film however i think ill focus on what really worked in this movie to start first of all the visual style was amazing the luscious colors in both day and night were spectacular being able to perfectly see everything in the night shots thanks to that low blue lighting was great of course all the practical stunts and other real effects were excellent too the only complaint i can muster for the look of fury road is that some of the action sequences had shots that were too close and used quick cuts which always make it difficult to follow what is happening aside from that occasional annoyance i found the action to all be intense and exciting most of the time i followed what everyone was trying to do and i could usually differentiate one character from another there was very little realism to the action in the movie people and cars defied the limits that youd expect if this was a real world but i guess we forgive that kind of stuff because its a movie world theres one thing for sure nobodys getting bored while watching fury road unless you find constant adrenalinefueled action to get tedious in many ways this does not even feel like a chapter in the same series as the other mad max films because lulls are few and far between and the entire look is completely different thats not a bad thing because revisiting a franchise 30 years later should lead to new ideas not rehashing the old stuff    the problems for me in this film start with the fact that the entire film is essentially one ridiculously long car chase sure the excitement is high but i cant even tell one interaction from the next it all just blends together in my mind as one big scene played out multiple times i also find that while i can visually differentiate the villains im not sure who belongs to which group or what each group of baddies wants the extremely limited talking in these mad max films continues to be an annoyance for me because they dont take time with any expositional dialogue so it can be hard to interpret what is going on and why although this film was probably one of the better chapters in the series also i find it hard to connect with and care about the characters because they reveal so little about themselves names are seldom used and youd have to wait for the credits to see some of the awesome names that george miller created also while some might not agree tom hardy is no mel gibson i didnt follow his emotional journey nearly as well as i could in mels performances i never see when hardys max turns that corner and starts caring about the women for that matter there are several shifts in allegiance that seem to come out of nowhere strictly for the convenience of the plot finally while i will avoid spoiling it i hated the ending if i was to go into the details i could go on for another whole paragraph just about the problems i had with the last 10 minutes so yes there were a lot of shortcomings i found in fury road but it wasnt a bad film it was gorgeous and a lot of fun to watch i didnt even mention how great the music in the film was and how it added to the action mad max fury road is definitely worth seeing but now that ive seen it once i dont really feel i need to see it again
May 24 2015,negative,drive your ass off for 3 days running away from a massive crazy ass army realize your driving to nowhere turn around and drive right back through that same crazy ass army to end up in the same place we started only to lose a few ancillary charactersthumbs down tough old women    if you like  1 sand  2 tricked out monster vehicles doing incredible stunts  3 post mortem abortions  4 charlize theronand frankly if you dont like charlize theron        you are dead inside  5 things that are generally not physically possible  6 and engine noise    this is the movie for you
May 24 2015,positive,action from beginning to end
May 24 2015,positive,love the action and a lot of meaning behind things in this movie
May 24 2015,positive,easily movie of the year mad max fury road brought back true action film making with all those practical effects and the action oh my
May 24 2015,positive,giving my mad respect for the masters
May 24 2015,positive,a symphony of madness
May 24 2015,positive,warning the badassery practical effects and cinematography in this movie may melt your face off if not furiosa will
May 24 2015,positive,amazing from start to finish i was not bored no down time not over done instant classic to put next to the originals
May 24 2015,negative,avoid not so much a movie as a brutal assault to the brain
May 24 2015,negative,absolutely rubbish movie  no story and very poor acting by tom hardy as mad max  avoid
May 24 2015,positive,very intenseit is like a big fight scene the whole movie
May 24 2015,positive,unlike mel gibson tom hardy is not as charismatic or instantly appealing as max but that is the only underwhelming aspect of this visually intricate and incredibly elaborately staged action feast this movie is so over the top in a good way that the idea of what the top is has just been forever obliterated even more appealing is that the use of cgi is restrained enough that it seems like most of the movies effects and stunts were done in camera in the real world wow just wow
May 24 2015,positive,the biggest reason to see mad max is just to actually see it visually it is a stunning movie the universe created is mostly desert but the shots are far from one note each of the main characters is given a story moment all their own despite having a rather large cast to work with the only exception perhaps being the villain i would have liked to have seen more from him the dialogue itself wasnt particularly original but this is a movie centered rightly so on its action more than its words it was a fun movie to watch
May 24 2015,positive,what a fun and crazy movie wow
May 24 2015,negative,i thought it was awful i dont know how it got those ratings
May 24 2015,positive,the action is very good yes but the characters who are as hollow as an easter egg dialogue that would fit better in a malick movie and a romance that is arguably worse than the one in the hobbit movies mad max fury road is by no means the best action movie of the decade and certainly isnt any where near the best film of 2015 like some have been saying the biggest disappointment of 2015 so far
May 24 2015,negative,this is a movie with lots of action  its a few minutes of setting the scene followed by nearly 2 hours of chase scene  theres no plot  the characters are not developed their backgrounds are not clear  theres only chase fight and lots of spectacular special effects never having seen the original movies i thought this would be better  i think i shouldve streamed one of the original movies instead of going to see this one
May 24 2015,positive,action packed with an excellent art makeup  and camera direction one of the best ive seen this year
May 24 2015,positive,love it    read the full review here 
May 24 2015,neutral,very bad remake it lacked excitment and was very oredictable
May 24 2015,positive,a nightmarish vision sure to blaze along the highways of valhalla shiny and chrome
May 24 2015,negative,just got back from seeing mad max fury road i am not sure how to say this but what a boring piece of dung oh it is balls out on special effects and the action never stops after 20 minutes i was ready to go home and play scrabble and i hate scrabble there was no character development at all i mean you get zero back story on anyone well accept max in the last 5 minutes he finally answers a question he was asked 2 hours earlier my name is max then of course there is a plot or should i sat the lack there of dont worry i wont ruin it for you though i am sure you can guess how it ends wait for it to come on netflix
May 24 2015,positive,mad max is visually stunning has some of the greatest action scenes ever made and is well acted unfortunately i think the hype is a little misplaced as there isnt really a story or any character development to go along with the spectacular visuals the story is giant chase scene in the desert followed by another giant chase scene in the desert thats pretty much it it is definitely worth seeing for the crazy over the top action though
May 24 2015,negative,i was very excited to see this film i thought it looked fantastic the themes were awesome visually it looked incredible and tom hardy and charlize theron awesome not to mention another modern run at mad max hell yes however honestly i was bitterly disappointed    first the good the film looked incredible visually i cannot stress this enough it looked amazing the costume makeup the sets the props everything was just absolutely fantastic the music was thrilling the cinematography was fine nothing seemed too outlandish or weird it was shot well overall the film was entertaining    the bad the script was absolutely abysmal i understand that mad max is not meant to be shakespeare but come on ive seen student films with better scripts and ive seen students deliver far more convincing performances the actors performances seemed largely phoned in maybe due to the script i cant really say the models who did their part should just not have been on the silver screen at all their awkwardly delivered lines just brought me out of immersion immediately which brings me to the biggest problem immersion was broken for me far too many times i understand that the film is meant to be a deathcircusonwheels but honestly some of the things going on were too ridiculous even for the mad max universe i was brought out of the experience by some of the crummy performances the ludicrous things going on eg guitars  those whove seen the film know what i mean and mostly just the terrible terrible script i understand suspension of disbelief but there is a point at which it snaps and i dont believe a technical spectacletwo hour chase scene is a substitute for even a basic character or even story driven plot    overall its fine as a popcorn movie enjoy it but i dont rate it highly because it really failed in some critical areas that could have made it absolutely fantastic areas which couldve been improved seemingly very easily
May 24 2015,positive,its a mad max movie  dont go to it expecting citizen kane and you should come away from this movie very satisfied
May 24 2015,positive,mad crazy and insane are the words that define the true nature of mad max fury road
May 24 2015,positive,bad assery everywhere from start to finish a mix of road warriorthunderdome
May 24 2015,positive,the action was very good in what is essentially a 2 hour car chase scene  not really sure why everyone is loving it so much but i did enjoy it with little to no expectations but obviously missing the huge love everyone has for it  went with 2 other friends and we all had pretty much the same impression
May 24 2015,positive,great movie however could of been so much more see it
May 24 2015,positive,may 15 2015    the context under which i saw mad max fury road was not one i prefer when watching any movie namely that i already knew about its high critical and audience reception i suppose thats a risk you run when seeing a movie a week after it opens naturally this raised my own expectations for the film and im admittedly impressionable so part of me feared i would simply praise and like it by default just because the majority already had which would make my own review rather hollow    luckily though i think my being so overtly aware of my circumstances allowed me to subdue my preconceived judgments and go into the movie with as clear and open a mind as possible which wasnt easy but i believe i managed and so it is my true and honest opinion that this latest installment of the nearly 40yearold mad max franchise and the first one to surface in 30 years is indeed a very good action picture superbly crafted visually ambitious and all around entertaining i wouldnt go so far as to say the entire production approaches greatness but it certainly possesses great elements    like its predecessors the story takes place in a grim and unattractive future one in which the world has become an arid dry and barren wasteland the original mad max 1979 practically pioneered this cinematic setting which so many other postapocalyptic actionadventure tales have tried to emulate andor build upon as far as the eye can see there is only dirt dust rock and leafless trees prompting inhabitants of this fruitless and depressing dystopia to ask who killed the world     theres no clear answer to that question but plenty of people are still killing each other as the population has been reduced to a single instinct survival water has become the most soughafter and precious commodity on the planet and different factions have formed to seize and control its sources one of the current dominating cults is headed by immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne a grotesque and tyrannical albino with flowing white hair who requires a special mask to breathe not unlike banes from the dark knight rises he commands an army of whiteskinned and nutrientdeficient war boys whom hes promised entry into valhalla if they serve him as the movie opens the war boys capture mad max rockatanksy tom hardy the former cop still haunted by the murder of his family he tells us hes the type of man who runs from both the living and the dead they enslave max because hes a viable source of blood    although the film is titled mad max fury road max himself is somewhat of a supporting character this time around which was refreshingly unexpected the more central protagonist is actually a heroine named imperator furiosa charlize theron a supposed loyalist to joe but as the plot gets under way furiosa leads a caravan of war boys into a rival gangs territory she hides in her giant rig five of joes wives each of whom only exists to bear his offspring furiosa a warrior and expert assassin has rescued these women from joes clutches in hopes they can all return to furiosas home called the green place joe and his thugs of course become privy to furiosas traitorous intentions and the movie eventually settles down as a twohour road battle between the two groups replete with various vehicle chases shootouts and a whole lot of deathdefying stunts max finds himself stuck in the middle but his lingering humanity eventually convinces him to aid furiosa and the women    weve seen a lot of what mad max fury road has to offer several times before and not just from countless other action movies but all throughout the mad max series itself contentwise theres nothing terribly new or original here and while the movie may be light on plot and character development its rich in theme and atmosphere director george miller who helmed all the previous installments and his team of artists prove they are masters of their cinematic resources the visual and sound designs along with the editing fully immerse us in this world no matter how dark dreary and unpleasant it may be we walk away thinking weve seen something unique which is a hard task these days especially for the action genre    the movies stunts are also impressive not to mention convincing because they seem to have been performed mostly with practical effects instead of cgi and on actual locations instead of against a green screen i was particularly struck by a sequence that finds max dangling from a crane thats swinging back and forth as his vehicle speeds down the open desert landscape it was a truly awesome feat to watch and fury road has more than its fair share of such moments    given the consistent quality and financial success of the original mad max trilogy we may wonder why it took miller so long to make a fourth movie reportedly fury road was stuck in development hell for years but whatever the reason it was worth the wait the movie is up there with furious 7 as far as delivering an exciting rush     with that said if miller is planning a fifth installment i do hope he makes it more character and storydriven weve seen he and his team can do action but id like the series to tackle its narrative themes on a deeper and more substantive level especially since theyve given themselves so much to explore thats not to say however it shouldnt still contain a heavy metal band rocking out on the front of a big rig as violence and mayhem take place around them that happens in fury road and really in what other franchise would such a scene feel so appropriate
May 24 2015,positive,a great action flick light on the dialogue
May 24 2015,positive,best film ive seen this year  excellent  insane
May 24 2015,positive,puts fast  furious to shame
May 24 2015,positive,epic brutal and cinematically beautiful  im a thirtysomething woman who hasnt seen the original but enjoyed this my boyfriends seen the original and said the storyline is different but he enjoyed it too
May 24 2015,positive,relentless is the word i would use to describe mad max having not seen the earlier editions of this franchise i only went in to watch this for two reasons tom hardy and surprisingly good critic reviews if trailers are the yardstick to judge a film i confess i was just freaked out with this films trailer mad max is set in a postapocalypse fictional world where the basic amenities are water oil and bullets rather than food shelter and clothes then we have max our chief protagonist with a murky past being slung along by a gang of maniacal men if only you could call them one in one hell of a chase across the desert though tom hardy was my initial interest to watch this film the film is literally owned by charlize theron who even in this age past her prime shines as imperator furiosa seeking redemption from the world that is around her on the surface it may look like just a crazy film mad max is actually several layers deep and even amidst all the lunacy in its characters we find some great emotional depth needless to say the action sequences are mindblowing with some really good use of 3d george miller adds detail and vibrance in the bleak arid landscape with some really gorgeous set pieces that will draw a wow from cinema connoiseurs where mad max lacks a bit is the surprisingly little back story behind all the ruckus happening on screen and that dulls the way one feels for the characters perhaps in sequels this would be much clearer it is definitely worth a watch in imax and especially watch out for the guitar shredder in between the dollops of action pouring out from the screen
May 24 2015,positive,thank god for australian cinema supplying the goods once again
May 24 2015,positive,the best movie ive seen is a long time i feel like ive been smashed in the face with a v8 engine pleasedo it again
May 24 2015,negative,i cant believe this film has such great reviews it was so boring and repetitive dont bother going to watch waste of money
May 24 2015,positive,high octane man fest if you like load explosions and mental cars then this is a must tom hardy is amazing as mad max
May 24 2015,positive,tremendous filmmaking  seriously awesome  simply fabulous  i was shaking at the sheer visual velocity on screen  i found it to be spectacularly emotional as well  this is movie magic  d
May 24 2015,negative,one of the most boring action films i have ever seen i was a fan of the series but me and my date were both way disappointed my favorite was when the row behind us said it was a waste of time we agreed whole heartedly     great music score but not enough to give it 2 stars
May 24 2015,positive,surprisingly original from start to finish and non stop action this movie was next level and has set the bar for future action films tom hardy proves acting is still important even in action movies with crazy special effects 5 stars for originality constant action cast effect and for just being fun to watch
May 24 2015,positive,amazing one of the best action films i have ever seen this is what mad max was meant to be all along
May 24 2015,positive,jawdropping in every way
May 24 2015,positive,a worthy fourth installment full of visionary action and adrenalinepacked
May 24 2015,negative,major disappointment for me then again im one of those people who loved beyond thunderdome there was never a moment the movie sucked me in i thought tom hardy was totally bland and had no idea what he was doing there major lucas episode 1 vibe maybe it is one of those movies i will see on tv at home and go o0oo0o0 now i get it but for now really missed mel gibson in this except for zoe kravitz and toecutter i found almost all the acting bland and uninteresting
May 24 2015,positive,reminded me why i used to love going to the movies so much
May 24 2015,positive,after the myriad sequels of transformers avengers fast and furious etc it is amazing how a 30 year old franchise comes as a breath of fresh air  if you are a fan of the action movie genre you must witness must witness witness
May 24 2015,positive,off the charts insane and awesome what michael bay tries to begeorge millerlol
May 24 2015,negative,nonstop senseless action way overrated
May 24 2015,positive,good film for anyone seeking a lot of action
May 24 2015,positive,madly ferocious and incredibly entertaining concept visual set design music was all excellent some mentioned cinematic orgasm a guaranteed adrenaline rush for 2 hours of course has to be in theatre and even without a clean look like what he had in skins or a single man nicholas hoult never fail to charm
May 23 2015,neutral,lots of action but a pretty weak storyline and its quite weird i did enjoy playing spot the aussie especially liked seeing quentin kenihan in his debut acting role  its two hours of car crashes and explosions the only difference is they go west for the first hour and east for the second  im actually not sure whether i liked it or not but my 11yr daughter thought it was awesome
May 23 2015,positive,a phenomenal exception to the norm in late revivals of classic properties fury road is a relentless run of action storytelling mastery with a full tank of guts grit and gasoline
May 23 2015,positive,i enjoyed this movie even more than i thought i would  it was exciting and action packed but the characters were also well written and sympathetic enough that i cared about their struggles making the action all the more meaningful and involving
May 23 2015,positive,tom hardy hits the mark well as the new mad max
May 23 2015,negative,guess im in the minority but not impressed same basic story line as road warrior was mad max captured  tortured ends up fighting to help the oppressed succeeds against all odds and rides off alone its just over 30 years since its debut what was cool and bada back then just seemed ridiculous and overdramatized this time around
May 23 2015,positive,action was excellent but nothing in the movie was explained things are happening and you dont know why hardly had no dialogue all action to the point i think it was too much action
May 23 2015,positive,this movie was good
May 23 2015,positive,from the moment we hear  my name is max we enter the most insane world ever conceived on film that alone makes fury road worth seeing
May 23 2015,positive,its a prerequisite that you enjoy the slightly zany almost comic book aspects of the mad max series if you do like the series you will not be disappointed fury road takes the best aspects ofmad max  the road warrior and thunderdome then dumps in a great cast and a large budget
May 23 2015,positive,ill have to watch this again to verify the extra half star but this is definitely the movie ive been wanting i didnt even know i wanted it sure it was over the top but it was done very well and the gratuitous 3d was only limited to one scene at the very end if you like mad max then you will love this movie
May 23 2015,negative,this movie wouldve been good but of course it had to have female nudity which ruins an entire movie
May 23 2015,positive,loved this movie was one of the craziest most batshit crazy movies ive ever seen  it was glorious  those saying it had no plot or that its just a two hour car chase werent paying attention  kept me entertained and even made me laugh a few times
May 23 2015,positive,this was quite an enjoyable and endless chase scene not much of a story going one but some nice character development and a few surprises the composite is not always up to standards and some of the shots are flat and unpleasant to look at but the design was quite refreshing an eye candy
May 23 2015,positive,will definitely see this againso much going on action symbolism subtext paradigm shiftsalso beautifully filmed
May 23 2015,positive,what i also love about this movie is that the lead character is a woman hollywood these days are always depicting women who need a man take care of them that they cant live without men that is definitely not the case with this movie furiosa is fierce shes skilled shes unpredictable and shes all out bad ass this is a testosterone filled movie but its not the testosterone that takes charge    action movies these days arent normally as good as one of the reasons being is that the hero is never really in any really danger if hes never in danger or near death how can you possible expect to have your audience on the edge of their seats pondering what if the inevitable happened max was in peril so many times in this film there was at least 10 times where i thought this is the end hes going to die then he miraculously gets out of it but its not the cliché type when someone luckily comes along at the last moment and saves him believe me there arent many if any clichés in this movie he fights his way out of these death defying situations furiosa out other lead is also in life threatening situations throughout this movie many times where we wouldnt know if she would make it    if you dont see mad max fury road in the theaters then you are missing out i went in imax and i can tell you it was worth every goddamn penny
May 23 2015,positive,action galore great looking movie
May 23 2015,negative,there is something very fishy about the high ratings for this movie from almost every top critic on rt this movie was disjointed at best zero backstory made little sense and the action element was totally overcompensating for the lack of storyline we left with a headache and feeling pretty lackluster about the whole thing how it got such high ratings is beyond me
May 23 2015,positive,it would have been so easy for george millers film mad max to fall under the heavy tropes and stylisms of the franchise yet even with flamethrowing guitars and copious explosions the central themes always returned to the humanity of the characters and the universalities of peoples journey to seek freedom and agency mad maxs organic story telling allowed the postapocalyptic film to become one of the best films weve seen in awhile many contemporaries should look towards the example miller has set
May 23 2015,positive,the best action movie ever
May 23 2015,positive,the definition of a highoctane thrill ride
May 23 2015,positive,what a fun ride man
May 23 2015,positive,tom hardy played a great roll as mad max really good story line and had non stop action
May 23 2015,positive,surprisingly it was actually good
May 23 2015,neutral,great spetacle nice photography and a lot of  noise bad dialogue no content or character development for max or furiosa
May 23 2015,negative,i had no interest in seeing this movie and only went because of the 98 rating on rotten tomatoes  all i can say is i hated it completely hated it
May 23 2015,positive,one of my favorite films of this summer for so many reasons good story great acting nonstop action a perfect theater movie
May 23 2015,positive,mad max fury road equals thats how you fucken make an action movie excellent stuff
May 23 2015,positive,fury road uses plot devices that are nonexistent in its genre only to exceed all expectations in story character development and style
May 23 2015,positive,this movie was better than the trailer made it look the cinematography was top notch the lighting was on point the explosions were amazing the red man with the guitar was crazy action packed and amazing  camera work
May 23 2015,positive,incredible action but almost too much and i love action could have used more story more dialog and the movie should have been titled mad furiosa since she owned the movie
May 23 2015,positive,mad max fury road features an incredibly simple story yet extremely effective storytelling through its action sequences rather than words the movie is intense from the moment the logos faded out till the credits roll it is the best action movie of the past decade
May 23 2015,positive,after 30 years george miller brings back this postapocalyptic nonstop road chase flick less mel gibson both tom hardy and charlize theron bring in their a game action that does not disappoint seeing this in 3d is worth the action eye candy all the way to the satisfying end amazing stunts from all that traveled with therons character wanted to see more backstory from maxs thinking so hoping for another follow up movie
May 23 2015,positive,so there was max and then charlize theron and the other girls in the desert and then that crazy dude with the guitar and nicholas hoult heart heart then blood violence gore the end
May 23 2015,positive,the newest mad max is a wow between art designs from comic artist brendan mccarthy and the drive of director george miller this is wildly inventive sometimes gorgeous and exciting action ride the 3 leads are greatthe others look cool had a bit of problems in some parts with the australian dialects and it might have helped to have seen the previous films more recentlyneither problem affected my enjoyment much worth it for fans
May 23 2015,positive,mad max furry road is epic and amazing
May 23 2015,negative,visually stunning zero plot no character development up there in one of the worst movies ive ever seen i know lots of people liked this but it was 2 hours of garbage save your money youll get more enjoyment watching the trailer
May 23 2015,positive,this was a great action packed film and i liked it too
May 23 2015,positive,this movie caught me in suprise and i havent watch the old mad max movies but now i found them intresting     so im gonna give this movie a    golden 10
May 23 2015,positive,if you like mad max you will love this movie the action starts and never stops amazing driving stunts enough said
May 23 2015,positive,it is the definition of pure action movie just perfect
May 23 2015,positive,omfg a must see nuff said love the mad max steampunk touch  
May 23 2015,positive,i loved that the characters were actually intelligent  it was a nice surprise that their werent victims and everyone fought together  great fight scenes
May 23 2015,neutral,plot development dialogue intelligence subtlety suspense wit chemistry and logic get tossed out the window as screen irrelevant in australian george millerâs return after thirty years for a fourth milking of the franchise what remains is two hours on the nose of visuals specifically of car chases and crashes flat uninvolving goodies fighting off nasties in heavy metal studs and duds where tired storyline is no more than an excuse for continuous noise beyond thunder and kinky violence in the namibian dessert
May 23 2015,positive,george miller has produced a thrilling kinetic road movie one of the best action films of recent years highly recommended
May 23 2015,positive,great movie  must seeso much action
May 23 2015,negative,ugh it was terrible
May 23 2015,negative,i like the second half better than the first half
May 23 2015,negative,great actors however i dont care for the movie
May 23 2015,positive,this is an action movie that is emphasized by action  lots of explosions car flips car stunts and some nice performances
May 23 2015,positive,testosterone asunder but seriously its really good
May 23 2015,positive,remember midnight oils breakout album diesel and dust this is the music video great stunts fire pale hairless people deformed midgets gasoline its as if everyone at the burning man festival was on a murderous rampage while on the run from pope benedict
May 23 2015,positive,full of action pack adventure and wonderful scenes mad max makes a triumph return
May 23 2015,negative,i just joined rt because of my outrage over the ridiculous rating this movie received the two stars i give it are only because of its elaborate production the plot is laughable the characters are thin and attempts at metaphor and profundity are pretty pathetic i saw it in 3d with a group of people and we all concluded it wasnt worth it but if you get off on stunts and pyrotechnics this ones for you
May 23 2015,positive,the perfect mad max movie it is what you get with unlimited money and a desire not to cg anything it is just an amazing display of old school movie making
May 23 2015,positive,charlize and tom
May 23 2015,positive,the best movie in 2015
May 23 2015,positive,this movie was a thrill to watch only thing i wish they had done differently was explained a few parts of the story that were going on chrome spray etc
May 23 2015,negative,was okay but i expected much more if they could of got mel gibson to do a small cameo this film would of got over a visual titan of effects but thats it fonzos
May 23 2015,positive,from the first preview this movie promised me an absolutely epic postapocalyptic tale told in the visual language of todays big screen big budget blockbusters while seemingly and surprisingly feeling very much of the lineage of the world of mad max    while thoroughly enjoying the film its and george millers genius didnt become apparent to me until after the credits rolled and i started processing what id experienced     from the opening sequences there was no denying the fantastic direction and choreography of the supercharged action but i wasnt feeling engaged or passionate about what was unfolding on the screen why visually it was stunning and compelling but it just felt soulless and dispassionate    soulless and dispassionate  i suppose much like mad max when were reintroduced to him     as it turned out it wasnt disengagement i was experiencing quite the opposite i was relating to maxs character  empathizing his apathy     passion is introduced by imperator furiosa engagingly played by charlize theron her character is such an unstoppable force and pivotal piece with a moral compass strength and drive that she reminds me much more of the essence of who max was in this series that this film could have should have been a reboot with her in the title role of mad maxine    emotion and soul are introduced with the arrival of the elder women warriors     emotion and souland hope     millers movie brings us along for this emotional evolution in just two short hours and all while masterfully limiting the dialogue of the characters but dont mistake the lack of dialogue for lack of character or plot development what isnt said here is whats important how the characters act react and interact with each other and their environment reveal who they are and what their motivations may be    admittedly the surface of the movie is deceivingly simple    crazy guy in a muscle car crazy guy captured crazy guy chased by crazier guys in crazier cars motorcycles flamethrowing guitar explosions salvation     yes its all that and moreso much more examinations of feminism heroism heroineism nihilism ecology sociology and you know a healthy dose of pimp my ride for good measure    remember that yes theres more to this movie than meets your 3d enhanced eyes there are plenty of isms and ologies to tease your brain but ultimately its mad max in a muscle car mad max captured mad max and mad maxine chased by crazier guys in crazier cars    and salvation    and a flamethrowing guitar
May 23 2015,positive,non stop on the edge of my seat action i typically dont care for pure action movies but this one is awesome
May 23 2015,positive,daft touching and utterly brilliant  this is essentially a 2hour car chase but with such detail and backstory  it feels like a classic indie film something by a young spielberg but money must have been thrown at some of the stunts  i want to watch this again  witness it
May 23 2015,positive,director george miller magnificently does great on the sequel of mad max  im now more excited about the next film of mad max wasteland
May 23 2015,negative,this movie sucked i dont know why it has such high ratings
May 23 2015,negative,abundance of action yet monotonous story line
May 23 2015,positive,absolutely fantastic  i didnt think charlize theron could pull off a  role like this but she nailed it  i expected an action flick that was going to be good but what i got was a great movie that is amazing  everything about this movie makes me want even more      finally hollywood did something right with a beloved series
May 23 2015,positive,fury road is much better than age of ultron and it demonstrates a keen postmodern deconstruction of contemporary action films but the ratios of high stakes action to superior filmmaking technique seems a bit off it begins with the lack of film grain and ends with scenes that are over the top max and furiosa are safely in the ranks of indiana jones and ellen ripply quality heroes though
May 23 2015,positive,it is a very well done movie but it has no plot just frenetic action if you like action movie this is perfect for you it is very very frenetic and has a lot of stuffs exploding in the screen at the same time for me it is good but not good enough
May 23 2015,negative,all style no substance waste of my fuckin time utterly pointless one star because i laughed at times at how unbelievably corny it was
May 23 2015,positive,mad max fury road is the perfect summer flick action action action a little story and a guy hanging by rope on the front of a truck playing a guitar that shoots fire   this is not a remake but a continuation of the adventures of max rockatansky tom hardy is probably the most versatile actors in todays cinema and he solidifies himself as the new mad max the supporting cast is great ive like nicholas holt since he was the weird looking kid in about a boy and hes minding the roles hes taking rather well as much as i thought this was going to be a stretch for him nicholas did a very good job   the movie loses a little of the craziness they introduce at the beginning as it moves along but with the visions he has at the beginning its not such a bad thing there is zero depth to the little story in fury road this movie was made to blow your mind visually not to spark an indepth discussion on postapocalyptic living or water shortages   mad max fury road needs to be seen in theaters for those of you who enjoy the big action that summer movies have to offer its an over the top film with spectacular cinematography
May 23 2015,positive,amazing my brain is still blown
May 23 2015,positive,lots of great stuff going on in this movie really enjoyed a lot of this movie visuals were great and they did a nice job of making the action easy to follow and it was very believable all of which i loved the reason i knocked this down four stars is that i had a hard time really loving or rooting for mad max himself i wasnt invested in his story at all i cared about the wives and the furiosa very much max however only uttered a few words in the movie and the writing didnt make me care about him perhaps i didnt need to because i was invested in other characters more overall i enjoyed the movie although i dont get the 98 rating maxs troubled flashbacks were a bit much and were very distracting from the action they kept taking me out of what was happening worth a watch but not an amazing film dont love the character of max but overall this is a well thought out movie with really good action sequences
May 23 2015,positive,high octane thrill ride from start to finish with explosive action to mind blowing visuals mad max doesnt disappoint believe the hype
May 23 2015,positive,loved it exciting and thrilling want to see it again
May 23 2015,positive,fury road is less of a movie and more like a beautiful painting ive seen it three times already and i plan to watch it again you can never stop appreciating a true piece of art the soundtrack is a ballad the action fills my veins with fresh adrenaline every time i see it i havent been this excited by a movie in a long long time
May 23 2015,positive,every choice of phrases that applies to this movie has been watered down by lesser works epic instant classic masterpiece     if you want to see a real apocalyptic epic movie kids here it is this is what we havent had anyone do successfully for 20 years this is what everyone else wanted to make
May 23 2015,positive,was ok kinda weird and cannot beat the original
May 23 2015,negative,movie was a big waste of time and money boring and at times slow moving  action scenes were ridiculous
May 23 2015,positive,a complete thrill ride from start to finish an eratic masterpiece which is quite possibly the most emaculately detailed apocalypse ever captured on film george miller exploits his true genius and portrays an entire world which has been developed across decades and displayed via fury roads self contained story the film contains themes of feminism capitalism and mans innate animalistic nature but disguises itself as an action packed blockbuster which it works equally as well as for those who want cars guns action and a good time
May 23 2015,positive,nonstop crazy unbelievable action  this movie is a huge spectacle in the best possible way really fun ride
May 23 2015,positive,oh what a movie what a lovely movie
May 23 2015,positive,in a postapocalyptic world an albino lead guitarist and a smokin sound system is a must
May 23 2015,negative,just about the worst movie i have ever paid to see
May 23 2015,negative,plenty of action but little story development very little expansion of the developing emotional relationship between the lead characters and between two of the secondary characters no explanation at all of how the villian became so powerful    of course such story and character development would come at the expense of a lot of the action scenes but it would have made the movie much more interesting to me
May 23 2015,positive,oo movie was awesome nuff said
May 23 2015,positive,all the glowing reviews this movie has been getting are well deserved    the film is very simple very minimalist in its dialogue and its still one of the most thrilling action movies youll see    the plot imperator furiosa charlize theron kidnaps some women from a dictator who is trying to get them back pretty straightforward oh and mad max gets involved too yay    the film feels like one giant action sequence with a few brief moments to catch our breath while the next chase is set up all of the action is so well done so well edited that the fact the movie is one giant chase scene does not cause the film to drag feel too long or feel too dull    if theres one problem with the film its with our title hero he kinda gets the shaft as the ladies are front and center in this one nothing wrong with giving the women more to do especially in films like this but at the cost of making the title character an afterthought in his own movie uh no    still its great its fun its completely insane and its probably one of the best made action movies youll see
May 23 2015,negative,no plot and no character development at all they left way to many holes in the end that left you with more questions than answers i left no really knowing anything about the two main characters for goodness sakes you dont event actually see max no including intro talking to someone until like 3045mins in the movie the only reason why i even gave something above 1 star is because of the great action scenes i am one action junkie but you need something besides a big car chase to keep me intrigued
May 23 2015,positive,so im not quite sure what i saw it was ridiculous actually but completely entertaining i am giving it 5 stars soley on the fact that after the movie ended my family and i including my parents stood outside the theater trying to make sense  of it for at least 20 min and quite frankly i havent done that since high school when i would go to the movies with my friends very very entertaining  and very very mad indeed
May 23 2015,positive,better then anyone ever could have expected
May 23 2015,negative,i gave this movie 2 stars only because the production value and fightchase scenes were well done  but this wasnt a movie  it was a chance to pay for a monster truck race    im a huge mad max fan  i loved the first one and the road warrior is one of my alltime favorites but lets be honest thunderdome sucked  im also a huge tom hardy fan  so this movie should have been greatright    the problem is that there was virtually no dialog or story  in fact let me sum up the entire movie for you spoilers ahead     max is captured   the bad guys send charlize theron out to get gasbullets   she turns left   all hell breaks loose and everyone starts chasing her   max gets loose and helps her turn left   she escapes and gets where shes going   she realizes it isnt what she hoped   they go back   everyone tries to kill them   they return   movie ends    honestly if youre looking forwell a story or some dialog or maybe justwell anything but chases and explosionsforget it    yes there were good explosions  yes there were intense fight scenes  but i can get that watching cage fighting matches and monster truck rallies  i wanted more  i wanted a story  any story would have sufficed    sadly this movie was so poorly conceived that all tom hardy got to do was grunt steer and occasionally shoot at someone    terrible move  truly terrible
May 23 2015,positive,mad is the correct word only way to describe just how impressive the visuals are how energetic the tone is how engaging the postapocalyptic atmosphere is and how wonderfully inventive the action sequences are i say sequences but the movie is basically one long action sequence imagine the ps3 game motorstorm with weapons and youre not far off not since inception have my expectations been so high going in so it shows a lot that it satisfied them its just a shame i couldnt give a 5 star this is because of the lack of characterisation which would have added deeper significance to the onscreen carnage unlike many action films i like the premise and it does provide all the important elements but i felt particularly little more time with mad maxs history and the villain was needed perhaps harsh since mad max fury roads biggest appeal is that it is pretty much all action while there is also a fineline before it heads into excessive storytelling this is why it remains a small personal criticism and one which should not stop you from rushing into the cinema at the next available opportunity to experience the madness
May 23 2015,positive,great nonstop action with pretty good story  not a big fan of charlize theron but she was great in it
May 23 2015,positive,as far as modern action films go this is the highest order george miller brings back the post apocalyptic world in huge style with some of the greatest live action sequences ever forget any other movie this summer this is the only one
May 23 2015,positive,i had a brother a baby brother and he was perfect in every way
May 23 2015,positive,futuristically explosive
May 23 2015,positive,this movie makes fast and the furious look like disney pixars cars
May 23 2015,positive,charlize theron is the boss
May 23 2015,positive,when it comes to mad max i have seen the road warrior years before  i enjoyed that film very much right from day 1 i became immediately intrigued after seeing the trailer for fury road after seeing it i can say it was an absolute blast  i enjoyed every single minutesecond of the film  great acting amazing direction by george miller who directed the first three mad max films awesome plot  by far some of the most excellent action sequences that will leave you wanting more by far one of the greatest films of the 2010s  21st century to quote nux oh what a day what a lovely day
May 23 2015,positive,cinematography was amazing acting amazing scripting and a few story elements were kind of cheesy
May 23 2015,positive,this is easily one of the most beautiful chaos action movies ever made i was expecting something big a big action movie without any story whatsoever the movie has an actual story the slow moments when the audience can breath develop a world with almost no exposition of it the visuals tell you how the world is how this people live and its beautiful the action scenes are the highlight of the film and theyll leave you breathless believe in the hype believe in george miller this movie is an action masterpiece
May 23 2015,positive,mad max furry road is epic and amazing
May 23 2015,positive,if you are a mad max fan this film is off the hook best action flik of the last 15 years straight up thrash punk from the word go
May 23 2015,positive,rarely do i spend my hard earned money on a movie twice but this one was too good not to
May 23 2015,positive,the strongest feminist movie in a long time well done and well directed made it worth the cost of the movie ticket
May 23 2015,positive,this is a remake of thunderdome i mean you cant really mess up the formula but i believe george miller was probably waiting to do this for a long time fun ride intense and worth watching in 3d
May 23 2015,positive,easily the greatest action film since 300 in 2007 over eight years ago and maybe even before that i had heard anything about this in the week after it opened so i decided to watch it on a whim since the trailer looked pretty good to my astonishment the film itself was just as good as the trailer nearly utter perfection
May 23 2015,negative,sucked i was confused from the jump i thought it was going top be mad max doing some amazing driving but within the first 2 minutes he lost his car too much weird stuff especially from the gastown dude charlize theron was amazing but everything else was just bad
May 23 2015,positive,while not the masterpiece everyones claiming it to be mad max fury road is a gorgeous looking thrilling enjoyable action film
May 23 2015,positive,fantastic driving great acrobatics and very loud music     the gang of women were called the vulvainis good action movie
May 23 2015,positive,what an amazing movie truly inspiring to see furiosas desire for a better world when everyone else has given up
May 23 2015,positive,pretty good i went into it with a little high expectations and it didnt quite live up to he hype it was a little cheesy and the cg was a little hard to ignore   true the vehicles crashes and stunts were incredible but even the coolest crashes and vehicles will look lame with that much cg lighting and environment work
May 23 2015,positive,the action is superb mad max blows up the screen
May 23 2015,positive,look if you are expecting mad max fury road to be just a carbon copy of the original the road warrior you are going to be both surprised    and not surprised yes mad max fury road is exactly like every mad movie you have seen     and also totally different confused join the club ill admit that it took me a few minutes to realize that the title character mad max wasnt the lead or the focus of this movie he is supporting character a utilitarian character a character not unlike the feral kid in mad max 2     the real mad max character in this movie is a female character named imperator furiosa who rose from her slavery to become a general in immortan joes kickbooty army of paint huffing war boys and what does she do well as soon as she gets her war rig  and the opportunity she snags joes wives and hightails it to some feminist fantasy land called the green place    and yes this movie is full of feminist propaganda how do i know well the director says so the author of the script says so and if thats not enough proof for you they cast a woman in the lead role so ergo its feminist propaganda i mean thats the way we all american eat all you want heterosexual white dudes think right woman in lead role  feminist propaganda never mind the that if the lead role had been cast as a white male wed all be thinking that it was a brilliant movie about    the manly spirit standing proudly up for his rights against the evil powers of a totalitarian regime    oh yeah the movie the movies great man just the cinematography alone is worth the price of admission which if you go to a matinée showing like i do it aint that much the shots of the namib desert are just devastatingly beautiful the pic above this review is a still from the movie and forget about any action sequences youve seen in the past the chase scenes across the desert are brilliant new camera techniques incredible car crashes great extremely great stunt work make this sequel the best movie of the mad max franchise okay i do admit i still dont like the way the shoot handtohand combat scenes these days they speed up the camera to make the fight seem more powerful and to also coverup the fact that the lead actors cant do stunt work it makes it all look a bit herkyjerky anyway no matter what of you love great action exceptional acting and storytelling mad max fury road is a must see oh what a day what a lovely day
May 23 2015,positive,insane definitely an action packed thriller that kept me on the edge of my seat you can count on me seeing it again
May 23 2015,positive,me meh  everyone else omgomgomgomgomgomgomg greatest movie ever  dont get me wrong its well made just not my cup of tea
May 23 2015,positive,lots of action yet has a good story
May 23 2015,positive,your going to feel like your on lsd but it was incredible def lands in classic movie territory unmatched to anything i have seen and i need a rock demon on my car
May 23 2015,negative,from the first trailer you can safely assume this will not be a serious movie worthy of critique i expected mad max to at least be entertaining but left disappointed mad max is to cinema as a runon sentence is to literature the entire movie is one long action sequence with few breaks to the dull and dimwitted this is a godsend as there are barely any pause in between gunshots and things that go boom the film equivalent of jangling keys in front of a toddler most action movies will leave much to be desired in the plot character development and dialogue categories but mad max takes this to a new level and forgoes them completely     our main character max is introduced to us through internal monologue and that is the last we hear from him until well over half an hour into the flick from the getgo we are thrown into action with explosions that test our gullibility into the abilities of the human body max suffers from obvious ptsd due to some previous event that is never explained at no point do we the audience empathize with our hero because at no point does he develop when he does speak it is for a few seconds of raspy directive towards other characters who are these people what are their motives how have they become who they are we are never told the most development we see is from the marauder nux a fanatical soldier of our main antagonist who for reasons not quite known decides to give up an entire lifes worth of indoctrination and fight for our merry band of damsels    in elementary school you are taught the six golden rules of story telling who what where when why and how who is our protagonist who is the antagonist george miller addresses this question by scratching the surface in assigning them names and then buggering off to design exploding spear things what is the back story what is the over arcing plot neither of these are addressedat all where does our story take place i know its australia from the previous film but no one new to the film would know this based on the actors accents and the indistinguishable desert backdrop when does our story occur no idea this is never stated why are our characters involved in the story maxs history is never addressed but its assumed he helps these women due to failing to protect people in the past furiosa helps them and it is never explained until the very end that she was kidnapped while young and thats the only time you hear of it how are things that occur possible this is a very good question what with the super sand hurricane fire tornadoes endless supply of firearms in a country that has banned them and the human body able to withstand crashes and thrashes into the sand at 70 mph if this was submitted to said elementary school class our young george miller would fail even by no child left behind standards    in short this is a film for cinematic philistines it is neither art nor entertaining if youve seen the trailer you can then extrapolate it to 2 hours and youve seen the movie for those that like substance in their film mad max is not for you it is a liquid runny mess that if sifted over mesh it would go right through without leaving behind an ounce of plot or development
May 23 2015,negative,really i like tom hardy and all but all it was was a two hour car chase took everything i had to not fall asleep definitely five yawns
May 23 2015,positive,do your duran duran video choices run to rio sun seas yachts or wild boys postapocalyptic weirdness what im saying is mad max fury road either is or isnt your thing i never saw the mel gibson originals and the premise of this and the images trailers etc didnt really sway me its not my type of film however after seeing rave reviews and hearing the feminist themes praised by critics i admire i gave it a go as a piece of filmmaking it certainly impresses bonkers eyepopping visuals amazingly inventive production design in the vehicles and non stopaction however it is a grotesque cruel and brutal world one that it didnt give me much pleasure to visit charlize theron is ripleyeque as furiosa pretty much the lead and the most compelling and cool character tom hardy is slightly baneeque as max and much less interesting but neither really becomes a character you get to know this film is so not a character piece there are some excellent action set pieces brutal fights and millers visuals really are stunning however if youre not into postapocalyptic road movies give it a miss it was fascinating to see this the week after pitch perfect 2  a film i enjoyed a lot despite some flaws mad max is a highly accomplished piece of film making but i have no desire to see it again or revisit this world
May 23 2015,positive,this movie was fun the electric guitar rocker on the front of the truck was hysterical  i dont really like this type of movie but this move was so allin that it kept me interested funny action goofy and fast
May 23 2015,positive,very good action love story is stupid though
May 23 2015,positive,get in your car and go see it remakes usually suck but this movie is boss great acting cinematography was amazing
May 23 2015,positive,best movie of the year or maybe even recent years  so far
May 23 2015,positive,talk about a killer guitar solo
May 23 2015,negative,saw it w scott who gives it 45 hard to understand whats being said due to noise explosions machinery crowd etc  made me physically ill excepting all that somewhat interesting story line not a choice for library
May 23 2015,positive,edge of your seat the whole time not sure how to connect it to the past mad max movies but pretty action packed by itself theron was amazing  spoiler alert how did they make her arm like that
May 23 2015,positive,this movie decided to push the gas pedal and inject nitro into the engine with the all of the action and stunts provided in the film
May 23 2015,positive,i have now watched this movie three times 3d every time youre a fool if you dont go see this movie at least once in 3d for the visual aspect if nothing else
May 23 2015,positive,over the top pleasantly surprised at the feminist angle in the story and but very well made  this has some of the best shot imaginative and choreographed action scenes ive ever seen  i had to dock a star for one scene in particular that was needlessly grotesque and could have easily been cut from the film
May 23 2015,neutral,visually stunning by far the best looking and interesting cars and art direction of the mad max films but the action has far more chaos than choreography and the story rivals thunderdome in stupidity plus max barely drives in it thats like a star wars film without a light saber battle
May 23 2015,positive,i was expecting this to be pretty mindless but i was surprised by how subtle some of it actually turned out to be as characterisation is handled as much by visual details and the emotional weight of some of their actions as it is through the sparse dialogue there is also a ton of background detail thats easily missed    of course the action is a standout feature of this movie and the focus on physical effects and spectacular stunt work helps to create a film that despite the insanity of it all is surprisingly grounded with a visceral quality that is simply lacking in many recent cgi laden soulless movies there is also a simply staggering amount of background detail that cant be seen in a single sitting    im thoroughly impressed by this late instalment in the mad max series but it is a more than worthy addition
May 23 2015,positive,what a moviewhat a lovely movie
May 23 2015,negative,wanted my money back yeah some of the action scenes are excellent but the story is thin with little development many things were so over the top they were a distraction to the story ladies being milked stilt walking people etc the movie manages to jump the shark in a short time  when the guy rips off the super charger from a vehicle with his bare hands i had to laugh out loud
May 23 2015,positive,visually spectacular  charlize theron is bad ass like none other glad i saw it and can recommend it for what it is  a fun tractor pull in a postapocalyptic world
May 23 2015,positive,it is rare these days to see a film that knows exactly what it is millers return to his series was not only an homage to the original source material but it flawlessly incorperated todays cgi tech with incredible practicle effect fury road plays in a very shallow sandbox but at the same time every single character is different besides just being a fun movie this film has some of the most incredible art direction i have seen in a movie go into this film with the mind set that it is a grindhouse movie and you will love it even more
May 23 2015,positive,alright the story is pretty bare and the acting isnt the greatest but as a pure action film i dont think ive seen many better in the last 10 years   i dont really need to say any more
May 23 2015,positive,pure action ride not much of a story but somehow it works
May 23 2015,positive,australians  are  awesome
May 23 2015,positive,this has to be one of the best pure action movies ive seen in a while although it lacks story telling this film exceeds my expectations with excellent action with remarkable cinematography and special effects throughout
May 23 2015,positive,after 30 years when max met charlize theron what a lovely day after 30 years  when george miller met the cgi generation what a spectacle the ultimate adrenaline rash
May 23 2015,positive,could not understand anything anyone said in the first 2030 minutes but it didnt really matter charlise theron is the real reason to see the movie
May 23 2015,positive,great action well worth seeing on the big screen
May 23 2015,positive,i went to go see this movie only having seen mad max 2 but to be honest that really doesnt matter you really dont need to have seen any other mad max movie it was pretty much its own stand alone movie but again that doesnt matter what does matter is how freaking awesome this movie was this is on my top 10 list this year for sure this movie was so simple yet extravagant it was mind blowing just do yourself a favor and go see this movie 1010 ign lol
May 23 2015,negative,does not live up to the hype no real memorable dialogue characters you dont really care about and will probably appeal more to muscle car and need for speed lovers for being an r rated film i expected at least a few cool deaths but this felt like a pg13 flick there is nothing new and exciting about this film i would much rather see kingsman again
May 23 2015,positive,i love action movies but this was boring
May 23 2015,positive,puzzled by the 98 rotten tomatoes rating and why some critics are comparing the experience to that of their first viewing of the matrix but it was a decent mad max movie as far as mad max movies go
May 23 2015,positive,best movie of summer so far  yes easily better than avengers  same feel and imagination of first 3 filmsbut 10x more action this film barely slows down fast n furious on crack i would watch again just to pay more attention to all the creativity and designs of the vehicles  all the low ratings are people who just dont get this type of film and thats ok they can watch other dull films
May 23 2015,positive,great movie lots of action that is non stop action acting is very good and the whole movie moves along pretty fastno real slow parts
May 23 2015,positive,when i was a kid i watched all 3 mad max movies but found myself oddly detached from the tale of the apocalyptic road warrior i say oddly because this genre was my jam i soon realized that i had a very clear moral expectation for my heroes and antiheroes alike you always protect women and children i found maxs flippant despondency offputting and distasteful so i can say that i never really got into mad max and here i am a guy who loved the universally loathed waterworld well i can safely say that that has changed completely with mad max fury road this highoctane ride had me completely immersed and cursing in amazement maybe it has taken years of living on this planet and a steady diet of the walking dead and the like to help me understand the true meaning of the word apocalypse this movie is thoroughly engaging much of the credit going to charlize therons portrayal of the tightlipped warrior furiosa she conveyed the entire history of the character through her face she is truly stunning in this show i also liked how they dispensed with the heavy exposition viewers were left to piece things together themselves which was refreshing i also liked the idea of the warboys and their kamikaze attitudes definitely a front runner for my favorite movie of the year
May 23 2015,positive,one of the best movies i have seen for the year so far hands down
May 23 2015,positive,perfect in every way violence drama and true to mad max future storyline
May 23 2015,negative,admittedly when i stood up at the end of the film and claimed to my friends that it was the single worst film i had ever seen in my life that statement was an exaggeration however i stand by the fact that it was the least enjoyable viewing experience i have ever had in a cinema         after seeing the trailer one week earlier it was generally agreed within my friendship group that the film looked pretty diabolical in terms of plot development  what could possibly be that interesting in a film that the majority of the plot is filmed driving through a dessert with minimal dialogue nonetheless after being told earlier in the day before viewing the film that it had been rated 88 on imdb i consciously made the effort to not judge the film by the trailer and i assumed that i was going to the cinema to enjoy watching a critically acclaimed film in hindsight i should have remembered from previous experiences that as soon as friends of mine see that a film is critically acclaimed they generally enjoy the film i on the other hand am not a film snob if i dont enjoy a film im not going to say i like it or search for reasons that credit the film just because it is well reviewed but dont get me wrong some of my favourite films are well reviewed films and here is just to list a few shawshank redemption batman dark night rises pulp fiction inception and the matrix the first one         i will now go on to discuss the reasons as to why i did not enjoy mad max fury road emphasis on the i did not enjoy this film and im not going to try and dictate to other people how they should perceive the enjoyment factor of the film firstly it is apparent that the film is completely impractical in the sense that it misses out on many basic aspects of what constitutes an enjoyable movie for example the film starts midplot and therefore requires the viewer to fill in the blanks at the start long introductions can be unnecessary but i personally feel a brief introduction as to how the protagonist ended up where they are is always needed  particularly when the whole film is based in a fucking desert additionally the film has a weak plot and as evidence of this i can summarise the plot in one sentence  nuclear disaster wipes out a huge chunk of the earth evil guy controls the only decent part of the earth left the goodies go on a journey to try and find some other decent land they cant find any so they kill the evil guy and live happily ever after in addition to all this unrealistic damage is inflicted on objectshumans by intense explosions throughout the film  when i see a car explode i expect the person inside it to either die or suffer third degree burns finally as mentioned previously the film has the most primitive ending possible  bad guy dies the oppressed overthrow the system and live happily ever after         on another note what the hell is that mug doing playing a guitar on the front of the truck see photo is there supposed to be some sort of symbolism behind this or is it actually just random moreover the flames coming out the end of the guitar look more fake than a rolex in thailand some of the cgi in the film is incredible and it is commendable that the film crew spent 6 months filming in the desert howbeit this isnt a precedent for a good film and it does not in itself make a film enjoyable in my opinion       after focussing on the negatives of the film i only included a few i will move on to discussing the positive aspects of the film notwithstanding i will remain critical of the positive aspects because lets face it i dislike the film essentially the use of colour throughout the film was incredible  my eyes needed some serious adjusting upon leaving cinema this includes but was not limited to the different coloured powder flairs dusty explosion scenes in the desert and the exploding vehicles in general in addition the use of women as a main rebel group was particularly powerful and challenged the classic stereotype of the male hero in spite of this why did millar believe it was necessary to employ the use of grannys on motorbikes if i wanted to see cringe worthy scenes like that id have watched avengers 2 saw that one week earlier ultimately the acting from tom hardy and charlize theron was impeccable but this did not make up for all the other reasons as to why i was not taking pleasure in watching the film         to conclude i appreciate there are people who would have picked up on more of the devices and subplots than i did im not a film connoisseur on the other hand people should appreciate that the film is not to everyones taste i reiterate  just because it is well reviewed it doesnt mean you have to like the film or else youre an ignorant idiot also i dont go looking for reasons to put down wellreviewed films  i just didnt like mad max the aim of this review isnt to deter people from watching the film if anything watch it twice and then make up your mind and im not saying people shouldnt enjoy the film my point is that people should appreciate that its a specific genre and not to everyones taste for a film that cost me 880 and a car journey to go and watch i spent most of the film wondering whether i would watch the film again even if someone paid me to
May 23 2015,positive,damn good shit for the crazy ones
May 23 2015,positive,see this movie brilliant insanity
May 23 2015,positive,the fourth entry to the mad max saga is surprisingly exhilarating with an incredible artistic approach towards its cinematography paired with an awesome soundtrack storywise its pretty straightforward with max being pushed to the side sort of but the ride is so good that i hope for another sequel
May 23 2015,positive,one of the best action movies ive seen in over a decade  george miller comes back in roaring fashion to create a bombastic visceral and explosive masterpiece  its really refreshing to see a movie that doesnt rely solely on cgi to establish stakes and the set pieces are set up exquisitely  the film also does a great job of forming the characters without much dialogue  charlize theron is great as imperator furiosa and tom hardy adds a lot to the movie despite having 10 lines at the most  make no mistake though this is a femalecentric narrative that hits everything you want it to in the most outlandish of fashions  a mustsee
May 23 2015,positive,surprisingly good addition to the mad max series
May 23 2015,positive,music was exceptional
May 23 2015,positive,there are two types of reactions you will possibly get after you watch this movie you will absolutely love it as it is the biggest surprise of the year for you or absolutely loathe it as it is the biggest bore of the year there are no middle grounds go and watch this movie if you are a huge fan of long action sequences think of it as a full on fast and furious post apocalyptic action sequence for about 2hrs 5stars
May 23 2015,positive,two hours of insanity miller proves he is the king of gonzo highprofile action movies and a towering cinematic genius
May 23 2015,positive,exceptionnal action movie great sens of speed and movement not much dialogues but the story is more about what is not said the scenes and photography style are amazing i was at the edge of my seat all along the movie and i got out still shakingso it is intense but no gory thank you for that m miller
May 23 2015,positive,turbulent action thriller which lacked substance   2252015
May 23 2015,positive,great movie tons of action
May 23 2015,positive,this movie is so damn epic ill be seeing it a few more times before it leaves theaters
May 23 2015,positive,maniacal pursuits across bleak postapocalyptic desert awesome landscapes loved the dude on the flaming guitar strapped to the front of the rig with the drummers pounding on the back miller should have dragged gibson out for an older max though
May 23 2015,positive,loved the sandstorm scenes  girl power   honestly felt thirsty after the film
May 23 2015,negative,go watch it just to say you did very disappointedawesome visuals but thats about it
May 23 2015,positive,the future belongs to the mad
May 23 2015,positive,action death speed a fucking flame throwing guitar what else can i ask from a movie
May 23 2015,positive,this film was totally insane  this is an action film with a capital a  its no ordinary action film at times it was like i was watching a perfectly choreographed ballet but with cars and people strapped onto cars    the casting is spot on  tom hardy is brilliant although he probably has about 20 lines of dialogue in the whole film  even though this is mad max film mad max isnt the main focus  that goes to charlize theron who is excellent and utterly believable as imperator furiosa hugh keaysbyrne returns from the first mad max to play immortan joe a villain you can really get your teeth into and looks like a cross between meat loaf beetlejuice and skeletor    full marks have got to go to george miller for creating a postapocalyptic world which isnt driven by cgi and its pretty macabre world shot in awesome colours    so strap yourselves in because this a full throttle action movie that grabs you by the throat right from the first frame and doesnt let go until its taken every last breathe out of you
May 23 2015,positive,this was by far one of the most action packed freakish movies ive ever seen if the world came down to this i need to start thinking about underground the person who dreamed up the apocalyptic idea is a true mad max or mad scientist
May 23 2015,positive,that was not a moviethat was a roller coaster
May 23 2015,negative,you could walk out for half an hour during the film and you wouldnt miss anything a very overrated film
May 23 2015,positive,on pure action alone it earns this rating not bad at all tho gave me road rage for no reason afterwards
May 23 2015,positive,wowi thought it would be good but it was better than unexpected i loved the original and this was even better it was non stop action from start to finish
May 23 2015,positive,exactly what it is a violent loud bombastic exciting ride through the australian wastelands it keeps the spirit of the old films alive with a new max in tom hardy while still being able to bring some depth to the characters within all the cars smashing and heavy music    grade a
May 23 2015,positive,the opening is thrilling and provides insight to why max got angry  watch it in 3d to add another perspective  the continuous action car scenes in the beginning required 3d  however didnt feel the impact of 3d towards the later parts of the film  overall solid movie to watch and well worth the extra cost of 3d in the theatre  great job and looking forward to this franchise growing
May 23 2015,positive,amazing movie tom hardy proves once again that he is from a different class     am
May 23 2015,positive,totes amazing movie the action scenes are incredible
May 23 2015,positive,awesome movieaction never stops
May 23 2015,positive,i wouldve loved this but tom hardys mr bean voice put me off
May 23 2015,positive,a refreshing new start to an old classic visually stunning and rocking action
May 23 2015,negative,i must be getting old  im a huge fan of this series and i as such i feel betrayed  some people love star wars some are trekkies  i am a mad max nut  still i walked out of the theater feeling like id been michael bayed phantom menaced if you will   yet another one of my favorite properties rebooted and updated for the modern audience  all style and visuals no character development and no depth  this movie could have been great  truly great  in the sense that they had many opportunities to give some depth to the characters or at least give us as the viewers some credit that we could appreciate some dialogue and not lose our attention   instead we get a nonstop string of action that doesnt allow you to absorb what you are seeing before moving on to the next explosion or person being run over  this is a movie made for a generation raised on video games with endless seas of baddies and constant death    are the visuals and design amazing yes  on that note they hit their mark  but when i see the reviews of this getting 98 approval i am simply baffled  did we all see the same film is there another version being shown everywhere else maxs character has been reduced to a secondary role  tom hardy certainly looks the part and is a fine actor  why was he made to be so one note in this  and why all the mel gibson bashing in all these comparative reviews mel was fantastic as max in all three films    what happened to the accents that was one of the best parts i suppose you could argue that furiosa couldve been raised by expat americans except she explains that away in her brief exposition on her being stolen as a child    the best character in this movie is the baddie immortan joe super creepy and loathsome  i wish we couldve had the typical and cliché hero banters with villlain scene if for no reason except to hear more greatness from the actor portraying joe  instead hes  given just enough dialogue to explain what anyone with eyeballs can see is happening      nux they jar jarred us people this character was so wholly obnuxioussee what i did there that i winced every time he got up and dusted himself off after being thrown from a vehicle and landing on his head  he was arguably the only character with an actual character arc in the traditional sense  too bad it was like watching a bad saved by the bell where jesse learns that drugs are dangerous  he starts off believing that he will be rewarded for serving his demigod master by sacrificing himself  only to have a change of heart and mind when he watches joe run over accidentally one of his concubines  it feels so sitcom like in its execution that i felt insulted      the word film in my mind doesnt apply to this movie  it looks and feels like a 2 hour video gaming session  this franchise has inspired some amazing video games most notably borderlands which was a fantastic and enjoyable nod to the world of mad max    sadly this is not the medium we are dealing with here  this is supposed to be something grander something deeper  the dialogue even feels like video game cut scenes  rife with dialogue that is poorly delivered and obvious  explaining whats going on so that people too dumb to interpret what they are seeing can follow along      this movie is a great skeleton dressed up with fancy clothes and makeup but no meat on its bones  please please please  dont screw up the next one based on the fact that everyone out there is lapping up this slop
May 23 2015,negative,this was the worst mad max in the series the movie is mad max not the theron show utterly disappointing i was so excited when i saw tom hardy was going to play the role of max but he had only 10 lines in the movie
May 23 2015,positive,awesome movie never a dull moment
May 23 2015,positive,i saw it last weekend  excellent summer popcorn action movie  i enjoyed it very much
May 23 2015,positive,just watched this with my friends during the second weekend after the positive word of mouth and i have to say this is by far the best movie i have seen all year and maybe one of the best ive seen in years overall an absolutely beauty of a trip i cant wait to see it again
May 23 2015,positive,movie of the year so far
May 23 2015,positive,the action in this film is probably up there with the best ive ever seen in a cinema really you would be doing yourself a disservice if you dint see this on the big screen knock off that halfstar in fact its essentially one long car chase with mostly practical effects and a gorgeously surreal apocalyptic world what it lacks in plot is made up for in thrills and spills it did annoy me somewhat that mad max is almost a side character on his own film and the plot is hardly revolutionary but yep you guessed it its all about the action and its incredible
May 23 2015,positive,this is a george miller film one should not be surprised at his take on life in a postapocalyptic wasteland he brings so much to the screen that its hard to take it all in this is a bigger badder louder mad max the road warrior
May 23 2015,positive,this film is one of those action movies that will go down into hollywood hall of fame one of the very best movies
May 23 2015,negative,max accompanies a woman trying to rescue pregnant concubines from a despotic ruler  while theres no doubt that some of the action sequences are wellchoreographed and mildly entertaining the most important part of a film is its story this one doesnt get started until about thirty minutes in and the character development is sloppy uneven and unnaturally rushed for example were supposed to believe that the frenetic war boy abandons his blind faith because of one embarrassing maneuver and the fact that he got to stare into a girls eyes for two minutes those must be some eyes  the reason that story is so important especially in action films is that the audience must be kept in suspense about how the action sequence will end here theres no doubt about who will survive the only question is how which isnt that entertaining  this films champions shouldnt think that i dont get the gender politics here i understand that the film puts women in positions of power that it stands against sex slavery and that its depiction of women is more progressive than many other films in the genre thats all great and the reason why the film got one star instead of a half  overall this story is weak and all the chase sequences in the world cant rescue a weak story
May 23 2015,positive,basically a gigantic swing ride
May 23 2015,negative,this movie was primarily action packed and relied heavily on cgi special effects it had  very little substance character development and story line i cant believe i actually went to see it in a theater the only one in the movie who really acted was charlize theron others may disagree with me  it was pure garbage in my opinion take the garbage out
May 22 2015,negative,mad max is a horror movie as in horrorible longest chase plot since smokey and the bandit  wait a minute  was that burt reynolds driving the monster transam with the penis cage on his face  charlize theron managed to keep a perfect manicure even after her collapsed lung was magically remedied by a blood transfusion from max who was obviously a universal donor  hey how much do i tip the skull encrusted guitar player  was that gene simmons  this 120minute car chase is sure to become a cult favorite among insane clown posse fans
May 22 2015,negative,just was kinda another bay movie just explosions not really a plot
May 22 2015,positive,100 minutes of 100 madness  action at 100 kmhr
May 22 2015,positive,i did not breathe for two hours that is all
May 22 2015,positive,non stop action awesome
May 22 2015,negative,critics loved this movie im not sure why i was bored after 45 minutes driving scenes dragged on and on and on as the hero and heroine survive innumerable unbelievable attacks while their attackers seem to drop like flies the action set and special affects are entertaining but the storyline and editing sucks
May 22 2015,positive,mad max is a fun adrenalinefilled film with tons of action the effects are impressive and i found myself on the edge of my seat at many key points in the movie on the other hand it basically was one long chase scene with virtually no character development much of the time i was confused about exactly what was happening for example what was the deal with the breastfeeding women there were also a number of plot details that were pretty hard to swallow why is every character in the movie super ugly and deformed yet there just happens to be a half dozen flawless and beautiful fashion models in the community pretty silly if you ask me and sadly mad max fury road is simply a retread of the past mad max movies if youre looking for a lot of action and explosions then this is your film if youre looking for an intelligent creative film with something new to say then look elsewhere
May 22 2015,positive,wild ride  one of the most original movies in years  made this years avengers and furious 7 look amateurish  never let up never confused plot with action
May 22 2015,positive,wow movie kicks ass
May 22 2015,positive,no mere raggedyman mad maxs return to film after 30 years is a near perfect return to form by george miller from the opening shot you can tell this is a better breed of film the cinematography the direction the stunts the practical and digital effects all come together with amazing editing and pacing to create a film that demands your attention for the entire ride    the film is smart too it doles out just enough information through its sparse dialog and intricate imagery to allow you to piece together your own picture of how this world came to be is this the old max from the past are these physical deformations indicative of nuclear fallout how did furiosa lose her arm    charlize therons furiosa is one of the best heroes to grace the silver screen in a long time and she is but one of many strong female characters in this film tom hardy is solid as max and nicholas hoults character nux has a great arc but its really furiosa who drives this film    this one was a long time coming and it is extremely rare in hollywood to give a director with this much talent this kind of budget for his passion project the budget and passion are all there up on the screen screaming for your well deserved attention
May 22 2015,positive,a little bit too abstract but still delivers
May 22 2015,positive,sensational adventurous thrill ride
May 22 2015,positive,this film is a strong addition to an already strong series technically flawless with a breakneck pace mad max fury road is one of those rare movies that is simply a treat to watch
May 22 2015,positive,visually stunning mad max takes you to another level  with the non stop action and crazy characters ii was one hell of a ride
May 22 2015,positive,incredible from start to finish best action film of all time for me the two main car chases are the best car chases of all time
May 22 2015,positive,ferociously unrelenting in its intensity disturbing  unlike anything i have ever seen
May 22 2015,positive,so much carnage but still a dramatic story
May 22 2015,negative,only worth seeing the first 15 minutes 
May 22 2015,positive,good plot a1 photography special effects
May 22 2015,positive,wasnt my type of movie but i liked it
May 22 2015,negative,unmitigated disaster  part of the general decline in hollywood  all action no true development of characters  rotten tomatoes has jumped the shark to allow a movie such as this to have a 98 rating  i will be going elsewhere for reviews
May 22 2015,positive,bad ass movie all action 
May 22 2015,negative,where do i begin story structure bad why the movie starts of with great action in the beginning but this doesnt transfer on to the middle of the story in other words the story dips in the middle living the viewer bored and wondering why they are watching this movie this movie had very good camera shots the cinematographer on this movie did a good job so thumbs up to you but this film suffers from the story and actors sorry i dont think they should have made this movie the older one is better next thang you know there going to remake water world lol  better story makes a better movie unless you have bad taste in movies
May 22 2015,positive,the film is worth it for the first half alone also everyone is badass yes that includes the foot soldiers the grandmas and even the wives  watching mad max
May 22 2015,positive,i had zero interest in seeing this movie it looked stupid when i saw the preview but went out of boredom its literally one big fight scene  i sat balled up in my seat with my hand over my mouth the entire time   its very intense  worth seeing
May 22 2015,negative,two stars for stunts and effectsotherwise pointless and plotlessoh yea and senseless
May 22 2015,negative,no plot all action i am not even sure what i was watching
May 22 2015,positive,best movie ive seen all year
May 22 2015,positive,so much of so much and enjoyed it immensely
May 22 2015,positive,it was a good movie i dont stop looking the screen until the truck stop and then action again the full movie is awesome better then i expected
May 22 2015,positive,so perfect  wannaseeitagain
May 22 2015,positive,this movie rocked it surprised me in many ways which is harder to do these days with action movies
May 22 2015,positive,big visuals and sound lite on everything else no surprises but a fun ride
May 22 2015,positive,well done but light in the character  human connection still it flys
May 22 2015,positive,this is a love letter all the 80s films
May 22 2015,positive,action packed mayhem loved it
May 22 2015,positive,although i understand the appeal of great special effects nonstop action and exciting chase sequences i also appreciate a compelling story  unfortunately story in this film seems like an afterthought  when i was 12 the constant barrage of speed explosions and flying body parts would have captivated me not to mention the scantily clad women whose body parts would have affected me in other ways however the repetitive action and stilted acting in fury road left me wanting to care about these characters but i never did   i give it 3 stars for the little boy in me who still appreciates action but leave 2 stars off for the adult in me who appreciates character development and a storyline
May 22 2015,negative,to me its the end of the road of american madness
May 22 2015,negative,seriously what was the storyline here escape and return the guitar nonsense was so stupid i just want to pick every little thing apart in this movie it was so terrible
May 22 2015,positive,rock and roll lives in the apocalyptic  future right on this is full on red bull with better flavor vibrant colors and limited cgi which just grabs you by the ballsand does not let go to the end theron just never lets you down and hardysolid it will be interesting to see the final numbers on thisfor sure not everyones cup of tea but i think the audience is not going to be happen stance this is a destination thrill rideand some people just do not like roller coasters
May 22 2015,negative,not sure i understand all of the hype
May 22 2015,negative,i dont get the hype on this onea 2 hour acid trip of non stop action sans plot
May 22 2015,positive,an amazing movie with amazing acting story action is as good as jason bourne movies
May 22 2015,negative,fun action but in whole a band playing instruments behind the bad guys was hilarious and just took me out of the movie also the story was weak with very limited dialog and didnt get invested in the characters at alll lame wait for redbox
May 22 2015,positive,i cant wait another 30 years for the next remake it was definitely easy to understand
May 22 2015,positive, ive seen this 3 times now one of the best action films of the last decade perhaps of alltime  the look of the film is gorgeous and great performances from hardy and theron  the film is essentially one long heartpumping action scene  a must watch     watched this a 2nd time and loved it again  best action film this year easily  beautifully shot loads of action and strong performances  this one is a must watch
May 22 2015,positive,this movie was nonstop high action entertainment i had a great time watching this film
May 22 2015,positive,wtf  a 98 fresh anyone seen this
May 22 2015,positive,best one out of all of them if you liked the old ones you will love this one
May 22 2015,negative,im not sure how an entire movie can be action but be boring at the same time    i almost walked out 20 minutes in but it got good reviews so i decided to give it a chance   that was a mistake    i kept hoping it would end and it just kept going and going   absolutely zero relate ability with any of the characters whatsoever weird and disappointing
May 22 2015,positive,great action scenes  good story line
May 22 2015,positive,easily my favourite movie of 2015 so far  an action movie masterpiece
May 22 2015,negative,it was trying to be thunderdome style mad max it was a little entertaining but not worth 1100
May 22 2015,positive,oh what a day what a lovely day  movie of the year
May 22 2015,positive,half of my face is melted off
May 22 2015,positive,mad max is decent but its not as amazing as critics are saying the visuals are cool the music is cool the abstract art is interesting however the film takes a half hour before you find out what the actual plot is mad max is a very exhausting film and is probably one of the most overhyped films of 2015
May 22 2015,positive,a hell of a ride hardy does a great job but theron shines past him
May 22 2015,positive,actionbased straight from the get go and onlyeases up a few small moments  it is a bit complicated to follow at times because it seems like everyone is fighting each other at times  but it is that exact element that makes it different and interesting  eventually the main crew partners up and ironically turns around to go back from where they came when the green land is discovered to be a wasteland now   at times this made is see to suffer from lack of purposes
May 22 2015,positive,boom boom boom this movie is amazing
May 22 2015,positive,my first rrated film in a theater as someone at the age of 21 or over mad max fury road is one postapocalyptically grand way to start off the summer with wonderful imagery interesting characters galore a visuallygripping story in that there really isnt that much dialogue an epic score and handsdown some of the best 3d yet dont be surprised if this is one rrated movie even your mother loves
May 22 2015,positive,this film was frickin amazing great characters and action 
May 22 2015,positive,its a true mad max movie not bad at all
May 22 2015,positive,this movie was funny i love the guitar guy
May 22 2015,positive,george miller is back sadly hes just as good but not better mad max fury road has the same exciting flow that the first two films had lets ignore the monstrous thunderdome but the nonstop action simply does not feel new for the first hour i was just bored lulled into tedium then kick ass visuals jump in and charlize theron truly steps up on that point there is little max in mad max hes barely there fading into the clutter but what super clutter great to see real trucks and cars bang up without cgi finally miller is back but his new max is a bit of a bore a bit of a dullard
May 22 2015,negative,its a thrilling visually riveting nonstop adrenaline ride with basically zero plot or character when you start at 11 theres really nowhere else to go so theres not much relief or fulfillment at the end all that said its a fun intense ride only worth seeing in 3d though
May 22 2015,positive,if you want a nonstop adrenaline rush this is for you charlize plays a great colead in a new edition of a great series george miller brings a well done movie to the big screen
May 22 2015,positive,hoooooooooly shit end of review
May 22 2015,positive,best movie ever seriously
May 22 2015,positive,loved everything about this movie good all around see for yourself just an overall good movie to look at everything tied in well
May 22 2015,negative,this was the stupidest thing we wasted money on  those who rated this high must not have actually watched it the action and explosions were lame the only thing anyone could have possibly liked was about 12 minutes for the guys watching the girls taking off the chastity belt and hosing themselves down  there was a slight attempt to throw in a moral to the story  but it everything was so stupid that the 1 line stating the moral was not enough to make the movie worth it both my husband and i were scared to get up and leave leave  not wanting to upset the other
May 22 2015,negative,the hype was not real
May 22 2015,positive,great bloke filmgirls love a bit of tom hardyit stayed true to the mad max styleloved it
May 22 2015,neutral,do not believe the hype  complete mindless and repetitive action  beautifully shot and a decent homage to the original but no heart and no one to route for
May 22 2015,positive,bar none if i could rate this at 10 stars i would this is what innovation looks like minimal cgi eyepopping cinematography superb acting and a unique sense of direction phenomenal
May 22 2015,negative,0 stars  this was the worst senseless waste of time ever how on earth does this movie get a 98 rating on flixster it should be 0
May 22 2015,negative,hideous awful lame pointless
May 22 2015,negative,overhyped gore missing a plot
May 22 2015,positive,definitely an unexpected ride pun intended 
May 22 2015,positive,30 years i have waited 30 years for this i loved it george miller once again nails it with mad max fury road worth the wait worth the spectacle worth the money go see it
May 22 2015,positive,loved it  film at its absolute best
May 22 2015,positive,the best action film exhilarating from start to finish all around great performance from charlize theron
May 22 2015,positive,its a pretty good movie
May 22 2015,positive,awesome movie lots of action
May 22 2015,positive,fun from start to finish and so much action the movie is gorgeous and overthetop just like it should be
May 22 2015,positive,awesomegreat movie great action
May 22 2015,positive,this movie is visually stunning the best way i can describe it is that fury road is like a nightmare come to life stuck in a barren wasteland with the scariest looking people coming after youbut ever though youre on edge youre having fun
May 22 2015,negative,aside from the absence of a meaningful  plot character development  or moral premise it was great
May 22 2015,negative,such rubbish it was almost impossible to sit through
May 22 2015,positive,my babe was luscious enough said
May 22 2015,positive,i was on the fence about seeing this film but mad max fury road completely delivers tom hardy  theron are good together very volume action all around in this movie mad max is back
May 22 2015,positive,very good action packed thriller great plot and super intense
May 22 2015,positive,once you get over how much the main baddy looks like the alien from predator some australian acting cringe and tom hardys weird sometimes aussie sometimes um somewhere accent you will be sucked in to one of the best action films in a very long time  it is virtually one long action scene but it does it with originality and style  the audience clapped at end  havent seen that in a long long time
May 22 2015,positive,the movie was weird and entertaining about as much as i expected it to be i have not seen the original films but that does not mean much as this film stands on its own the action sequences were awesome and the use of practical effects made it all the more real and thrilling i do agree that the story and its characters was not terrific in the sense where you feel for the characters such as the emotional impact when furiosa finds out there is no more green place but overall it seems okay the plot is easy to understand right away and the film alludes to characters pasts in a simplified and decent way all in all it was a really fun movie and i loved it
May 22 2015,negative,effects are kind of cool but what a godawful story boring and nonsensical and just so stupid
May 22 2015,positive,definitely going to see it again
May 22 2015,positive,if you want to see a good action movie i cant really recommend this however if you want to see a great nonstop action movie mad max is for you dont expect much plot but who needs that when the action is so amazing  got to enjoy this in my own private theaterguess no one else got the afternoon off like i did i could get used to sprawling in a theater like thatheres hoping i win the lottery someday so i can have my own home theater  
May 22 2015,positive,a sequel which does justice to the original mad max movie an awesome action movie with some great action sequeces and awesome cinematography this movie sets an example for action movies of this era
May 22 2015,positive,if you want to see a good action movie i cant really recommend this  however if you want to see a great nonstop action movie mad max is for you  dont expect much plot but who needs that when the action is so amazing    got to enjoy this in my own private theaterguess no one else got the afternoon off like i did   i could get used to sprawling in a theater like thatheres hoping i win the lottery someday so i can have my own home theater  
May 22 2015,neutral,huh what is with all the great reviews i was sadly disappointed i wanted it to be great but it barely made good it was kind of hokey they drove from one place to another then back again the special effects were great but i need more than that to consider it great also despite the fact that mel gibson has been an idiot lately it would have been really neat to have him do a cameo
May 22 2015,positive,i wanted to leave the first 30 minutes then it got good
May 22 2015,positive,an amazing ride with surprising depth and volume absolute must see in the theaters
May 22 2015,positive,every so often there comes a film that challenges perceptions and alters the genre of which it sits that happened 34 years ago when mad max 2 the road warrior came out and influenced the entire postapocalyptic genre for decades director george miller is a visionary in every way which made it perplexing that a quasiremakesequel would be made on the heavily influential films as many of them fall by the wayside to cliché special effects pg13 ratings which hinder the violence and mayhem and an abundance of doing the same thing as before but all of that would be washed away the instant the credits roll on mad max fury road as its at times nothing like the original trilogy but in other ways very much like it fury road is dazzling in its portrayal of a lawless world while beautiful in its inert unpredictable chaos nothing is what you expected and it never leaves you hanging as it forcibly pushes its foot on the pedal going gleefully straight into the heart of madness    mad max rockatansky tom hardy is a tortured loner who is grieving the death of his wife and child at the hands of ruthless marauders he travels the desolate australian landscape by his lonesome only looking out for himself while trying to overcome his nightmarish visions of his dead family before then he gets targeted by a maniacal and crazed army of mechanics called war boys including nux nicholas hoult under the order of despotic ruler immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne joe runs rough shod over the citadel which is one of the last vestiges of a society where he cruelly holds back water to the destitute below him to further influence his power over the land he has imperator furiosa charlize theron attain gas and ammunition from neighboring towns but finds that she has stolen a harem from him commandeering a soupedup semi she travels the desolate landscape in search of hope and redemption but along the way she meets up with max and they both have to trust each other to escape the tyrannical rule of joe and his ruthless followers    to begin with one does not need to see the previous mad max films to appreciate fury road but it would be helpful to see the older films and get a feeling of where miller originally began with this character not to mention that they are amazing and cult classics there were simply too many facets of this film that i love that a second viewing is basically mandatory but the design of everything stood out as its instantly eye grabbing its impossible to watch it and not be wowed with amazement at every minute detail that went into creating this gorgeous and brutal world it really went out of its way to show you something different and make sure that it stays with you long after the credits roll the citadel looked amazing and was a perfect enclosure for a man to rule over people who are weaker than him its one of the most allencompassing postapocalyptic visions i have ever seen as so many things get covered throughout the film you see how water is dispersed women are made to breed crops are grown and automobiles are made to look like it came out of satans personal garage it sets the bar incredibly high for design and it wouldnt be too crazy to see fury road be nominated for best production design at next years oscars maybe makeup too as it added another dimension to the characters and setting nearly everyone is stamped with a tattoo marking or tag as everyone looks like they came out of burning man the tattoos are somewhat like native american cultures among many others where they become part of the history and growing up    it only makes sense that the man who innovated the genre with mad max would do so again with fury road showing that sometimes it takes the same man to outdo himself the automobiles looked something out of odd rods as everything looked downright menacing as well as cartoonish nothing here would be presented in the actual world in any way but looking at it onscreen you wish you had one as your own to terrify other motorists on the road the thought it took to create them is astounding as it looks like grown adults reverted back to their inner child and cooked up anything at all that looked cool and downright insane no regular person can think of this stuff as it takes a special person with a deep imagination for the bizarre  the war rig driven by furiosa could not look any cooler and is like a revamped truck from the road warrior joes gigahorse is completely menacing with the monster truck tires and the melding of two cadillac coupe de villes on its body the moving concert stage or the doof wagon is unlike anything that i have ever seen it just defies logic and understanding and could not be more perfect for this postapocalyptic wasteland and of course one of the greatest automobiles in cinematic history the interceptor makes its valiant return after not being seen in beyond thunderdome it looks just as awesome as it did 34 years ago giving me all the feels in the right places the cinematography by john seale made this bizarre circus freak show amazingly beautiful in so many ways you get a distinct feel for the sand and sun drenched lifeless barren environment and the scope of joes massive psychopathic army    everything pops when you look at the screen and it sometimes makes it hard to follow with so much mayhem but thats half the fun youre not meant to take in everything the first time upon viewing with so many details on screen youre allowed to see every bit of them as nothing gets lost on screen its one of the best visual cinematic experiences i have ever had as every shot looks like art in the same realm as stanley kubrick many visual masterpieces the editing by margaret sixel was quick and frantic but not confusing in a way where you dont know where the action is going youre able to follow every punch gunshot crash and other various acts of mayhem very fluidly the use of slomo which can be used in a cheesy way were used perfectly here with so many catastrophes going on all the time it needs some slow motion added for the most visual pleasing effect possible it makes seeing every bit and piece of a car shattering into pieces and bodies falling by the wayside that much more pleasurable    the soundtrack by junkie xl is one of the best soundtracks i have ever heard its pulsating drums sweeping strings and manic electric guitars create a whirlwind of symphonic chaos as well as quiet sentimentality every track feels powerful and important while making you feel you could go a little mad with the war boys for a bit as i am listening to the soundtrack right now it makes writing this all the more easier there is a distinct influence of hans zimmer who may be the best film composer living today i really havent heard a score as fury road since man of steel which coincidentally was scored by zimmer and was worked on by junkie xl junkie xl also worked on the equally mesmerizing soundtrack to the dark knight rises as the influence is very palpable here escape and brothers in arms are some of the very best tracks the soundtrack should have been nothing short of brilliant since the soundtrack for the road warrior by brian may was one of the best action soundtracks ever    for a man whose 70 years old george miller certainly doesnt look it or act like it he attacks the screen better than many directors over half his age and then some theres a tenacity that is really sorely missing from todays field of blockbusters and its as if its a direct challenge to the biggest directors in the world today it feels like miller is saying are you not entertained to the michael bays of the world much like martin scorsese with the wolf of wall street who was 70 while filming this movie miller hasnt slowed an inch and shows that he is even more insane than before he wants you to see hear feel and think of everything around you and keep you entrenched in the world for two hours i also liked how he handled the radiation from the nuclear fallout and many people being disfigured or near death because of it it adds to the hectic environment where many dont have much to lose and much to gain in valhalla being that he has been out of the action game as well as postapocalyptic australian for decades you could feel that he was having the time of his life filming fury road as if he never left    he is daring and dangerous whos willing to put the actors and stuntmen through the physical and mental ringer to get the perfect shot which makes it terrifying and exciting on what ideas he has for future sequels the manic quick fast paced closeups have become a staple of the mad max films and they are all over the place here its one of the great pleasures of watching this film seeing everything go quick and crazy then you see the aftermath of the chaos in slow motion he knows how to create intriguing new characters with a semblance of humanity trying to hold on to ones sanity or just outright viciousness for all the nonstop action its paced extremely well giving one the perfect amount of time to breathe and recollect ones bearings miller knows better than anyone on how to construct an action sequence and showing something that no one has ever seen before the road warriors climatic action sequence near the end is one of the best chase scenesaction sequences ever filmed bar none and even today can still go toe to toe with any action sequence from any of the fast and furious films    this makes it hard to choose a favorite action sequence in fury road since its basically one long massive chase scene its the final chase scene in road warrior but extended to two hours i would have to say the final chase scene is the best one since it encapsulates so many things at once like any climax should if fury road was a benchmark for action films what would the next film look like miller seems to come in at the right times and show everyone how its done with blockbusters the way they are now with a superfluous amount of special effects and a hindrance to a certain type of order it can get a little tiring after a while so seeing a film that throws basically every rule out the window is one of the most refreshing experiences one can ever witness many of his influences like james cameron seem to have gone backwards from his more subtle practical effects background where he instead tries to reinvent the wheel again and again with the most realistic special effects ever seen but its just nice to see things reverted back a bit where everything wasnt done on screen its revealing to get down to the nitty gritty    thats why its nice to see an action film with as limited special effects as humanely possible while still being incredibly exciting furious 7 was a fun ride and i really enjoyed it and all but it became quite forgettable once the dust had cleared avengers age of ultron falls in that same category but not as much as furious 7 never have i seen stunts so out of this world and something one would see in a cartoon the amount of pressure and danger to pull these stunts off is nothing short of extraordinary i think this may be the most outlandish use of practical effects for any film ever it seems hard to top but if anyone can its george miller i could not have been any more excited for ultron but fury road was the main course for me it just offered so much more for me while still being fresh in many ways the only other film that got me more excited this year than fury road is star wars episode vii  the force awakens which no doubt will be amazing    miller wrote the script with interestingly enough the help of an unlikely pair that dont have any success with screenwriting brendan mccarthy is a comic book designer with works in tv and film who incidentally was influenced by the road warrior for a comic book while nico lathouris is an often unseen character actor who was in the original mad max as a mechanic together they craft an intimate humane and rollicking action film that is often tender at the right moments while sporting mesmerizing set pieces its way more intimate than most action films while challenging the view of women in the action genre the battle cry of one of the escaping breeders saying we are not things is basically a big fu to every director producer and screenwriter who demoralizes women on screen using them for overt sexual purposes weak underdeveloped characters and helpless damsels in distress its a theme that is everpresent throughout the film while not being the single main attraction of the entire movie its one of the strongest films to ever approach equality in a concise manner where miller doesnt beat you over the head to make you understand men arent evil but the plights of world destruction usually begin with a man who could not care less as many of them are in powerful positions it doesnt make them bad but infallible    max doesnt have much to say but when has he ever had much to say he doesnt speak because he wants to he only speaks because he has to he has always been a silent animalistic brute who speaks when its most important max hardly speaks in the road warrior and it hardly matters since he is a man of action i think the gyro captain even spoke more than him so it clearly didnt bother me at all that he didnt speak much in fury road its the quiet moments that hold the most power as we hear furiosas story and her mission towards redemption and safe haven or nux becoming disillusioned in his place among the war boys and his rightful ascension into valhalla its not as if max is suddenly going to open up about his dead family since he has never done that before previously max doesnt need to tell and no one knows why max is so mad and he wouldnt have it any other way he did punch pappagallo in the face for outright demanding what was wrong with him in road warrior its the mystery of his character to everyone else as well as the audience that makes him so intriguing as well as seeing him move on from a loner to an important cog in furiosas mission for redemption and hope he will never be outright good or bad but even teetering on the brink makes him more relatable than most action heroes nux is an incredibly complex character that brings a needed dimension to the mad max filmography you get deep down to how the war boys think and how easy it is for them to be depressed its hard to find another oddly intriguing character in any movie    the story is as simple as the previous mad max films and doesnt need to be wrought with swerves double crosses intrigue and twists to be exciting or innovative like many blockbuster films max rockatansky is basically just trying to move on with his life by his lonesome for the most part but gets caught up with violence and mayhem max tried to do that in mad max and start a new life with his family while holding on to his sanity but they got hunted by a vicious biker gang leaving them murdered in the road warrior max just wanted some fuel and supplies but gets caught up with the plight of a community of survivors holding gasoline while battling vicious marauders in beyond thunderdome he just wants his camels and supplies that were stolen from him but gets caught up in getting a tribe of kids to a safe point in the city in fury road max just wants to be left alone after being hunted down while leaving anyone else in the dust but gets caught up in helping others to safety the stories of the mad max films are paint by numbers sometimes but it doesnt make them any less exciting its the simplicity that makes them so enjoyable and sets them apart from their blockbuster counterparts    fury road starts off guns blazing and ends with enough ammo to spare the fact that its one long chase scene makes it quite an anomaly since its so simple one would expect something more but it has more than enough to keep anyone satisfied furiosa does hold the screen for a lot of the film but that is no way a slight as it mixes up the films a bit the movies are about max but its also about the people he encounters along the way the last two mad max films have a narrator that help to move along the legend of mad max and without them the movies would be nothing max moves in and out like a ghost or a distant faded memory and doesnt need to have the spotlight on him the entire time hes one of the very few action characters that is sometimes in the background and isnt really forced upon you max is a strong enough character by himself which always makes the surrounding characters that much more intriguing here max isnt that much different but he is still able to command a screen even if its not played by mel gibson  immortan joe looks something out of darth vader with his pale scarred skin middle aged body breathing face mask with altered voice and battle armor adorned over his chest his raccoon steely striking eyes instantly strike fear into his enemies and his imposing garb makes for a very intimidating character he made for a great menacing villain that goes through some surprising character revelations which doesnt make him any less endearing but still all the more effective    one of the many things i loved during fury road was the names for all the characters as they all became instantly memorable and right on par with the humungus toadie wez the toecutter and the nightrider its hard not to love names like the people eater the bullet farmer the organic mechanic the splendid angharad capable toast the knowing the dag cheedo the fragile coma doof warrior and quite possibly the greatest name to ever be uttered on film or in the history of time by anyone dead or living past present or future rictus erectus maybe the coolest character to never utter a single word in any movie ever may be the epic heavy metal axe slaying flame throwing guitarist coma who provides the battle ground with epic metal riffs to swiftly aid the war boys in combat i couldnt help but smile and marvel every time i see him since its so illogical in any setting real or fictional to have a truck full of massive speakers war boys pounding on huge drums and a masked man wield a guitarflame thrower nothing about it makes any sense but thats also why it worked so well and why i want one so very bad    in the past there have been many iconic female characters that rival any man when it comes to being a complete and utter badass furiosa ranks among the class of ripley sarah connor trinity and the bride among others as a classic female action character she is strong driven can throw a mean punch despite not having a fist attached to an arm and willing to put everything on the line shes also a crack shot with a rifle often hitting her target with only one shot she performs a much needed kill shot when max was missing but it wasnt portrayed as one being emasculated or made to feel less than but the other person being the better shot furiosa takes no crap from anyone and will do everything in her power to make you realize that even though she doesnt have a left arm youre not meant to feel sorry for her and she doesnt elicit sympathy because of it here she is just as capable of firing guns driving a rig and punching someone out as someone with two fully functioning arms not to mention she just looks so much cooler with a mechanical arm the women she saves also have strong personalities which the film does much to separate them with individual identities and not have them be helpless or overtly weak they were made to be weak and served as they dont often see the plight of the survivors below of course they were attractive as anyone who breeds animals would want the most pleasing to the eye for mating    the acting all around was top notch and didnt feel at all like it was overacting or too overly cheesy everyone here fit their part perfectly as an integral part to the madness tom hardy is quickly becoming the go to guy for tortured empathetic powerhouses he was brilliant in bronson warrior the drop and the dark knight rises while keeping control of an entire film by himself in the powerful locke i have always said that hardy has one of the most expressive eyes in film as he can portray quiet pain and suffering better than anyone one look into his eyes and you can read so much without him saying anything his body language powerful silent charisma and brutality make him the perfect fit to resurrect max for a new generation hardy can bring out the humanity in his portrayal of beasts where you dont really know which side of the fence he is on man or animal you want him to be ok and be welcomed by a new family of people but that wouldnt be his character hes a loner a rebel    theron also fit her role as furiosa like a glove exuding the same power charisma and cunning as hardys max its the kind of role that can catapult an actor to another stratosphere as franchises are incredibly huge right now shes a character you want to know more of even if you got the gist of it while hearing her backstory furiosa is a little more central during some parts of the film and integral because she has something to lose and isnt as far gone as max she still has something to strive for and a dream that can be fulfilled so it makes her a little more approachable theron has a great no nonsense mentality that doesnt move an inch even when shes approached at gun point furiosas loss runs counterpoint to maxs loss in a great dichotomy of character in one scene furiosa tells max about a safe haven for the women and you see the pain in her face as she looks in the distance like there has to be something there while max just looks cold as if there is nothing there at all theyre two similar characters while being completely different mentally and it makes for a great pairing as hardy and theron have amazing chemistry together they go so well of off each other like peas in a pod but not once did it feel like there needed to be a forced romantic sexual involvement it would do both of their characters a disservice if they were to be involved romantically    hoult was by far the most unpredictable in the whole movie as the death obsessed war boy who hopes to die in a blaze of glory he looked instantly unrecognizable as his name in the trailer was the only way to know if it was him shaved bald and covered in white paint with scars adorned all over his body he is a somewhat misunderstood soldier and someone you cant keep your eyes off of and thats not because of the paint scars or shaved head he adds much to the film with his own type of madness which is saying something as nearly everyone is mad and steals many scenes that he is in his manic and desperate attempts for acceptance from joe and the war boys are somewhat sad and tragic but funny all the same you cant help but feel for him but then you get all excited when he yells what a lovely day as hes driving in the middle of a sandstorm waiting for an epic death    when it comes to any sequelprequelremakereboot of any kind there is always a need for expansion from previous films which fury road has in gusto one aspect that is awesome is the differing sects of clans groups and marauders in the desolate australian landscape you have allies of joe like the bullet farmers and gas town as well as enemies like the bikers the buzzard tribe and the vuvalini who all command their own part of territory and do anything to protect it from invading forces the vuvalini are also very interesting in that it is wholly composed of women mostly middle aged but are also battle worn and ready to fight at a moments notice they are just as willing to put their lives on the line when they have to and arent treated any differently if they were men having all these groups just makes the world that much bigger and impressive instead of a one group per film like the previous mad max films or nearly any franchise its great to see how others were affected and how they deal with the new world landscape and loss of essential resources you already want to know more about them which makes the film that much more intriguing    one of the best aspects of the entire film is how joe commandeers the war boys to do his bidding at mere will using aspects of viking religion he creates an entire religion and imparts that they will reach valhalla if they die gloriously in battle war boys prey at the bottom of a monument to steering wheels in an effort to make their lives a little more rounded but this applies to many aspects of war like kamikaze pilots during world war ii and suicide bombers in the middle east using religion as a form of control to do things that you wouldnt is as old as time and it makes all the more sense that religion would be used on the fringes of society after the entire world has collapsed the war boys are so interesting in that they have nothing much too live for since the world had ended so life after death became the ultimate price as it must be better than life currently all they do is work on cars drive and hope to see their friends in the afterlife so anything to live for makes the current life just a little bit more tolerable it also goes to show that whenever there is no hope to be gained in an empty world and there are people who need someone or something to guide them amid a wasteland religion will be the most powerful tool of all    being that i grew up watching mad max and the road warrior and loved both of them dearly while loving mel gibsons quiet tortured performance in them it remains a special part of my heart i exclude mad max beyond thunderdome since it was awful in too many ways not to mention that i cannot stand the influx of remakessequelsprequelsreboots that invade the screens too many of them hardly do anything to stand out but after watching the trailers i knew that fury road would be different and would go against the grain in nearly every possible way its a rare category that its one of the very few remakessequelsprequelreboots that can be appreciated alone for its genius from its brilliant counterparts its so out there that it basically flips the entire genre on its head there is only one other film that i would mark as one of the greatest action films of all time and that is the raid 2 berandal where that itself was also a groundbreaking achievement mad max fury road is one of those rare every once in a while blips of brilliance amid a sea of mediocrity much like the matrix it may be hard to understand for some at first but eventually it will find its place amid the alltime greats from a wide populace earning the respect it sorely deserves five glorious deaths during battle and a trip to valhalla out of five
May 22 2015,positive,amazing filmmaking from george miller once again tom hardy pulls it off just as well as mel gibson
May 22 2015,positive,a true cinematic experience im no fan of 3d but in this film had me flinching everything from the actors performances to the way the film was shot to the action it was all superbly done what a thrill from start to finish tom hardy owned the mad max role its a bit different from mel gibsons portrayal of mad max but it works i dont know what people were going on about this being a feminist movie thats nonsense it isnt its just a thrilling action packed movie with a lot of heart its not just dumb action theres a lot debt to the characters with a rich story and  spectacular performance from the actors if you havent see it go see it
May 22 2015,positive,explody thingys make me go happy yay
May 22 2015,positive,mad max fury road is a spectacle to behold in the best of sense its epic grandiose and every other adjective there is under the sun to say how grand in scale this film is    the film is set presumably after the first two mad max outings wisely ignoring the camp that is thunderdome    we open to see max rockatansky surveying the desert to a grim voice over and being haunted by the failure to protect his daughter unfortunately he is thrust upon by the warboys the personal errand boys of immortan joe who is the warlord of the region the boys wreck maxs car and put him into slavery as a universal blood donor for malnourished warboys such as nux nicholas hoult at the aptly named citadel    at the citadel we come across imperator furiousa a commanding charlize theron who decides to sneak immortan joes beautiful young war brides to a better place on a regular gas supply naturally joe isnt too pleased about this and sends his armada to reclaim the brides and kill furiousa thus the fury road is set    i have to admit i was impressed with this film the stunt were awesome with very limited cgi used and even then the cg used was impressive the narrative and dialogue may be the simplist trope of survival but it works well i was also impressed with the fact the miller had created such an immersive and realised postapocalyptic world    there were elements which jarred and didnt really make sense but as soon as these moments came along they would be drowned out by a spectacular action sequence    the acting all round was solid with theron probably just stealing the limelight from tom hardys max the supporting characters out with hoult and the war brides were pretty stock and interchangeable the war brides included rosie huntingtonwhitely who isnt as bad as she was in transformers dark of the moon but isnt completely believable either zoe kravitz character has even less to do yet all the brides manage to get you to empathise with them    overall this an entertaining almost at times operatic entry in to the mad max franchise with good performances excellent stunt work and cgi max is back roll on mad max wasteland
May 22 2015,positive,just because a movie is a reboot of an 80s movie no one needed to see twice in an environment where original movies cant be written in a really tired setting does not mean it cant be a unique and artistic cinematic experience     completely solid setting barely any tedium this movie goes full speed from the opening scene until it turns around and speed back just as fast it is never boring it is probably the only movie that actually deserves to be called visceral despite how overused it is     hollywood take note you dont need to pander to the audience stuffing tired and bland exposition down the throats of your audience step on the gas and let the world speak for itself the characters barely speak they just act they do and it works spectacularly you dont need joe mcdumbarms saving princess sweettits every goddamn time turns out giving grandma a turn works really really really well
May 22 2015,positive,a lot of fun  tons of action and amazing stunts and limited cgi makes this a winner in my book  2 of the fastest hours of movie watching that i can remember seeing in recent history
May 22 2015,positive,absolutely the best action film ever made incredible
May 22 2015,positive,i dont like action movies but this was another level another world
May 22 2015,positive,take everything from the previous movies and turn the dial up to 11 more vehicles bigger vehicles loads of practical stunts and an cool story matched by an interesting new motley crew they could honestly start an entirely different set of movies around imperator furiosa she is that badass
May 22 2015,negative,what a dispapointment  whats the fuzz all about no story no acting performance asked from anyone tom are you crazy boring stupid repetitive non stop action   30 years latter miller is now a big fat pussy with nice artificial claws a big up to the art design department anyway  
May 22 2015,positive,guys its simple mad max fury road is a masterpiece not only does this movie have great action it has amazing characters dialog and heart this movie features great fx that are all practical about 90 of the explosions and action are all practical and makes you enjoy the movie much more the movie is set in a post apocalyptic world and it does a good job at setting a dark tone and world you really feel the characters motivation because of the world the movie is set in the cinematography is also fantastic there is no shaky cam its all marvelously shot the acting is perfect tom hardy as mad max was perfect in fact i think he was better then mel gibson the villain and characters are great also obviously you have max but the stand out characters are the villain and the character named furiosia some of the best action includes these characters in the end mad max fury road is a high octane action joyride it has great characters acting story setting and of course brilliant action this is definitely one of the best movies of the year absolutely amazing perfect from start to finish can i say any more yes overall this is a gleefully insane film the relentless pace never holds back on the audience and it always has them glued to the edges of their seats if you can i highly recommend everyone does themselves a favor and witness this masterclass action phenomenon that will arguably go down as one of the finest action films ever made
May 22 2015,positive,this movie has in no particular order psychotic action an incredible soundtrack consistently badass and believable characters gorgeous visuals at two refreshingly tropefree hours doesnt overstay its welcome if you only see one movie this summer make it this one
May 22 2015,positive,this was far more of a great movie then i expected charlize theron was just great it was a reboot of the road warrior and not the original mad max   still this was a crazy action packed movie from beginning to end i think there were only 2 moments in the movie where is slowed down every other minute it was non stop action   you also had a few moments where they paid homage to the original movie but nothing too in your face
May 22 2015,positive,fury road ist full of pain madness and it really hurts its not a remake no it is rahter more then that it is the next logical level of the total franchise what i was missing in the previous parts the dramarturgicial growth and development of the charakter this has been delivered by fury road this movie save me the summer
May 22 2015,positive,wasnt expecting it to be good but it was gooood
May 22 2015,positive,its just a really fun movie that just keeps on giving
May 22 2015,positive,imagine this youre in a theater but instead of simply watching a film youre grabbed by the shoulders and violently shaken for 2 hours thats the fantastic experience of mmfr its less an adrenaline rush than a direct ivshot of caffeine into your bloodstream faster and more furious than the most recent carbased movie its kinetic action in the style of a fever dream a punkrock postapocalyptic nightmare thats a feast for the senses benefiting from director millers visionary and fearless eye pure unadulterated insanity that reminds us what it looks like when great artists try something uniquely extraordinary and succeed  millers main achievement is getting everyone to buy into this insanity with the scale of a blockbuster and the soul of an indie mmfr is unlike anything youll see in theatres this year hardy as the new max continues the characters reactivestyle heroics with just enough heart behind his crazy eyes and all the supporting cast portray their varying levels of madness with crazed conviction however all of these talented performances are overshadowed by the amazing aesthetic through grimy herkyjerky visuals miller gives us practicaleffectsfilled action sequences that are masterpiece level   this isnt to say there isnt something deeper going on on top of being of a feminist manifesto a study of religious extremism and an argument that capitalism leads to death its ultimately a moving story of equality and hope that proves goodness can defeat desperation havent seen the mel gibson originals thats okay dont let the daunting task of seeing all those first keep you from one of the greatest action films in years
May 22 2015,positive,that was just awesome go see it
May 22 2015,positive,thats what i want to see in a mad max movie violence action emotional pull a story that carried from the original trilogy death and great effects more stunts and practical effects that we have come to know and love great cinematography and storytelling subtle things in there are great hidden gems nods to the originals depth to the character too non stop thrill even in 2015 and with all the funding it felt almost like an 80s post apocalyptic b movie which is perfect
May 22 2015,positive,you will walk out a the theater with a sore sore due to how tense the action makes you feel
May 22 2015,positive,this is probably the best action movie i have seen all year got a give it to director george miller he did an amazing job the action sequences were incredible and the story was great non stop action from beginning to finish and it felt like i was watching an 80s movie done right highly recommend this movie to anyone you dont need to have seen the old ones to understand this one
May 22 2015,positive,adrenaline overload  theres no better way to describe this movie metal as fck
May 22 2015,positive,best action movie ever
May 22 2015,positive,though on the surface it appears to be all about the explosions and charlize therons rad eye makeup mad max delivers something more the themes of environmentalism mixed with a dash of false scarcity ring true in todays preapolyptic world get ready for the ride of your life and an epic flaming guitar because we really need more of those     highly recommended you wont be able to look away for a second
May 22 2015,positive,tremendous relentless epic as f cant wait to see it again
May 22 2015,positive,a crazy round trip in the wasteland with the company of the hottest girl of the neighborhood what else do we need for two hours of fun
May 22 2015,positive,the best action movie of the decade the return to the grubby violent world of mad max is a complete triumph its both completely unhinged and insanely chaotic yet totally controlled with a masters precision of filmmaking craft and narrative economy with not a scene or exchange of dialogue wasted its a truly breathless movie with just the barest bit of set up the movie sets off running straight  away and never stops until the end credits come up it can be a really intensely visceral experience overwhelmingly so theres points where you draw a deep relieved breath after an extended action sequence such is the rare and even exhausting way this movie grabs and holds you in its thrall for two astonishing hours of some of the most intense demented detailed post apocalyptic world building and possibly the most insane stunts and automotive destruction youve ever seen its also in a left field turn a fiercely feminist action movie as a plus with charlize therons imperator furiosa one of the toughest coolest characters in a long time man or woman as an extra plus tom hardy steals mel gibsons crown in a big way here hes fucking great
May 22 2015,positive,i cant ask for more totally made my day 5 stars movie
May 22 2015,positive,bold ambitious and apocalyptic mad max is an adrenaline ride for the senses
May 22 2015,positive,wellworth unkind visual communication
May 22 2015,negative,other than the action it was a waste  a red box movie
May 22 2015,positive,a technical and visual marvel the actionpacked mad max fury road has breathtaking visuals and heartpounding action thats a feast for the eyes but also has welldeveloped characters fine acting and a strong story as director george miller brings his twisted postapocolyptic franchise into the 21st century in insanely thrilling fashion
May 22 2015,positive,best action movie in a long time fast paced adrenaline filled action extravaganza
May 22 2015,positive,i love art and this film has great special effects the story was okay and at times cheesy but if you love cgi and any kind of effects this has it all
May 22 2015,positive,middle of the pack action movie that rehashes the mad max themes and adds nothing newjust more of the same old thing visually a lot of fun though
May 22 2015,positive,what a day what a lovely day
May 22 2015,negative,this movie is the worst movie of 2015 so far  it amazes me how this movie is rated to high
May 22 2015,negative,plotless demented carnage disappointing
May 22 2015,positive,exaclty what i wanted from a mad max movie experience my favourite part of the previous films were the over the top vehicular action scenes and the bizarre characters so i loved that this movie was filled with as much madness as they could cram in it may be lacking in the story department but it makes up for it with some of the most spectacularly filmed action scenes i have ever experienced
May 22 2015,negative,didnt enjoy it to much of a political feminist message in it      as a contrast a group of women who kill ever man they find socially ok a game of thrones episode where nonconsensual sex happens off screen people freak out    i dont believe half of these reviews are real or the people actually saw a movie they are pushing an agenda  silly and disappointing
May 22 2015,positive,one of the most exciting movies ive ever seen absolutely incredible action
May 22 2015,positive,madmaxfuryroad is spectacular awesome beautiful chaotic car carnage best action movie in recent memory  this yr
May 22 2015,positive,a high octane road trip into the mind of george miller and it was worth every minute not a dull moment in this move definitely on my top 5 greatest
May 22 2015,positive,mad max features extremely impressive action sequences and stunts along with an intriguing storyline about a postapocalyptic society searching for a better tomorrow its an instant cultclassic and surely will be one of the best action movies of 2015
May 22 2015,positive,oh my just go see this inventive imaginative and fantastic
May 22 2015,positive,im confused  maybe i saw a different movie than everyone else  i should have loved mad max fury road being a big fan of the series and each of the prior films  dont get me wrong i enjoyed it and i wouldnt call it a bad film or anything but with critics and viewers falling all over themselves about how great it is im just left thinking i missed something or im harder to please  without spoiling the ending i can sum up the movie fairly easily  take the tanker scene from the road warriorone big vehicle driving through the wasteland while dozens of smaller vehicles chase and attack it relentlessly  now stretch that scene into a full movie and you get fury road   the characters are mostly new and the reason for their journey slightly changed but the bulk of the film is a big long action scene  having said that the action and stunts and visuals are overthetop in the best way  it is a nonstop gang brawl on wheels and that is very entertaining for what it is  if you liked the other films in the series than you absolutely have to go see it  i may even see it again to figure out why everyone is so excited  98 tomatometer doesnt happen very often so the chances are if you are a movie fan or critic youll love this movie  i didnt love it but enjoyed it enough for 3 and a half stars
May 22 2015,positive,odd characters and intense action the plot is simple enough but it takes a backseat while the quirky violence is in command one id love to see again and will definitely own
May 22 2015,positive,considering the wave of terrible 90s scifi sequelsremakes weve had fired our way in the past few years terminator robocop total recall etc fury roads success has been more than a pleasant surprise    it takes a lot of very 80s dystopian postapocalyptic sensibilities and puts it in modern context the relevant storytelling characterization and heavy play on social themes make it a compelling tale but its the barebones relentlessly unforgiving visuals that make it a thrilling ride through and through    theres more to the world of mad max than sand dunes and angry people with automobiles though with very little screen time miller manages to convey a very elaborate society full of warrior tribes caste systems and culturalreligious customs that are intriguing if not visually iconic    lets also not forget the cast of characters representing a variety of minorities without feeling like forced tokens a phenomenal performance by charlize theron breathes badassery into furiosa and the manic nux played by hoult it seems the best way to bring back the strong silent type hero is to in fact keep him silent who wouldve guessed hardy skims by as max with stern looks grunts and single syllable words and for that we love him    at the end of the day fury road is both a nonsensical visceral action packed adventure about a bunch of rebels fighting the system but also an intelligent character study with a dab of social commentary some of these folks are larger than life max others victimsvillains turned heroes furiosa breeders nux which ever you appreciate more youre both cheering and enamored by the spectacle
May 22 2015,positive,i will be honest i had never seen the original trilogy from the 70s80s so i didnt know what to expect when sitting down to view mad max fury road i sat down to what was probably the most exciting two hours of cinema that i have been exposed to this year and possibly ever in the action genre i am not a huge supporter of explosive action movies but george millers seamless directing made the story flow beautifully while still maintaining brilliantly paced and energetic fight scenes and a car chase that will leave you breathless and exhausted in the good way the whole film is one long sequence but never has a dull moment tom hardy delivers one of his rather silent performances with very little dialogue but still delivers one of the coolest performances of his career packing an abundance of emotion into his role as far as acting is concerned the stardom doesnt stop there charlize theron in her empowering feminist role gives the best performance of her career she not only kicks ass in the action sequences but like hardy puts so much emotion and heart in her role she is the true shining moment of the film and helps piece everything together the art direction cinematography editing sound mixing and editing costumes makeup and screenplay are equally as fantastic and there isnt much to say negatively about this film if you are not a huge fan of the action genre like myself or hate how some movies are so modernized that it seems fake then fear not because mad max feels real and isnt gussied up by glitz glam or monsters and robots it is high paced and will leave your pulse rushing and your tush on the end of the seat a mustsee
May 22 2015,positive,fantastic movie theres not a boring moment in it
May 22 2015,positive,in this film is fury road named after avengers  director nick fury nah but seriously this is film badass
May 22 2015,positive,jesus fucking christ can the industry please start copying this over and over please
May 22 2015,positive,with minimal dialog and a simplistic plot the movie can be dismissed but with fantastic performances a great sense of pacing and some of the best live action sequences ever put to screen this movie is a visually arresting experience that never lets up and is easily highly recommended
May 22 2015,positive,what the hell this is unbelievable
May 22 2015,positive,aside from being a long car chase the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat with nonstop twists and turns there is not too much dialogue form the protagonist because it was not totally necessary overall was amazing
May 22 2015,negative,wooden acting enemies suddenly become best friends surprise destinations that make no sense and an absolute lack of a plot all make this a rather dull movie despite the non stop truck chase wait for it to come out on free to air
May 22 2015,positive,the world of mad max is a desolate and dry one    people huddle together in clans it seems in far off and distinct areas hard to call any of them cities   they wage war of sorts on the roads and desert flats   it is a brutal and violent world    our hero whose voiceover in the beginning talks about his own torments and nightmares both present and past that lead him to a simple life path of just surviving   he says very little and what he does say can be difficult to decipher at times    the action is fast and furious and comes in waves    car chases motorcycles guns spears explosions abound   there is a simple plot but it is minimalistic   the action sequences are where this movie is making an impact    road warrior was never much for deep philosophical thinking    it is loud and intense   i came away not seeing exactly what all the hype was about  it was visually interesting but then i think is that it    i guess that i expected more and my expectations were set high by the reviews     i was distracted at time with the speedup camera work that was done  its old school but gives the film a strange pace   there may not have been as much cgi but there were still plenty of tricks   and max is not as impressive really than charlize theron   she is good  there is real emotion there and she feels as though she is giving hope in an otherwise hopeless and brutal world    i am glad that this had some closure to it because like middle earth earlier in the year with the hobbit i dont feel the need to return to this world again in the near future
May 22 2015,positive,an action movie that felt different from most of what i have seen over the past few years there is such a bad ass vibe to this thing and it doesnt fear being different the editing in this film is oscar worthy i thought it represented the madness of the world quite well though hardy is the selling point of the movie it is therons time to shine and she is extremely convincing as a tough as nails chick
May 22 2015,positive,the first mad max movie was really the last one in which max had anything resembling a personality or character thats not to say that the mad max movies arent enjoyable its that max isnt really the main character in his movies he just wanders into other peoples stories in fury road the story belongs to charlize therons furiosa and the supporting cast of women fighting for their freedom and survival taking these movies as a whole you realize that theyre not really about max or even the characters that max meets but of this postapocalyptic world and the various cultures this catastrophe created this is a world where resources may be in short supply but sometimes you wouldnt know it looking at how much gas must be consumed in order to do all of the eyepopping vehicular stunts     many will claim that george miller in general or fury road in particular are rebukes to cgiheavy action where visuals rely too much on a computer and therefore lack the tangibility of practical effects and stuntwork there is some merit to that sentiment but what must be made clear is not that cgi is inherently bad its that cgiheavy movies have a tendency to lose their focus on the action that problem lies at the hands of directors without a sense of scale millers work here is focused and kinetic therons performance is grim and determined and one can imagine that she is just a few traumas away from turning into max played by tom hardy in grunts and snorts that make bane seem like john maschita
May 22 2015,positive,dont let all the butt hurt men steer you away the ratings do the movie justice so definitely go see it if you have the time and extra money
May 22 2015,positive,best movie ever see it on the big screen with an epic sound system this is the most multisensory movie you might ever witness it starts loud and fast and just keeps going relentless epicness an absolute visual and acoustic feast you will leave the cinema exhausted in a good way from being blown away for 120mins straight an australian masterpiece
May 22 2015,positive,absolutely mind blowing awesome fun high octane visuals and sound cinematic must see
May 22 2015,negative,i am amazed that this movie was rated by critics so highly  has our society become so addicted to over the top violence that the consensus becomes that this is a good movie  not me    if all you want to see is a movie with a weak plot hyped up violence and excessive visual effects and explosions then this crap is for you  yuck
May 22 2015,positive,i feel like 1 out of 10 people have seen the first three installments of this story  which means that 1 out of 10 people will understand it  the plot line is only thin if you havent seen the previous movies  for fans of the genre i would say this  its a perfect mix of road warrior and thunderdome with the added benefits of cgi  if you dont understand that then watch them first and then go see fury road
May 22 2015,neutral,just one long car chase with no real substance  pretty disappointing
May 22 2015,positive,a revvedup vision of gloriously twisted design propulsive momentum and resonant mythmaking
May 22 2015,negative,the trailer is the whole movie  thoroughly tired of cliched postapocalyptic views of the future  contrived and unrealistic pandering to excessive testosterone
May 22 2015,positive,great stuff pure action movie really pushing with intensity and events many times better than the original mad max in my opinion tom hardy is good speaking little
May 22 2015,positive,i was never into madmax as a kid with fury road i get why i wasnt into it still not my type of film basically no plot no character development its all about action and craziness and thats kinda awesome
May 22 2015,positive,an assault on the senses in a very good way
May 22 2015,positive,i write this as a compliment to george miller because the last man who made me feel this way when leaving a theatre was edgar wright the last time i exclaimed these words was the first time i enjoyed scott pilgrim vs the world  i said i dont think ive ever seen anything like this before  this was my first thought after experiencing mad max fury road    now if youve somehow found your way to this review theres something you should know about mad max fury road its bananas absolutely 100 batshit crazy no im serious  its not 80s campy its just crazy but thats what makes this movie special it runs on wild manic insanity  i mean theres a dude bungee corded to a mack truck playing a guitar that spits fire  this movie is crazy pants but oh does it work    i never really got into the mad max trilogy  it was one of those things that we talk about in our film geek circles and i just sort of stayed quiet  but even still i loved mad max fury road  actually my movie going compadres enjoyed it as well and they hadnt spent anytime with the trilogy i know the original made scifiaction movie history but im going to just say this now  so will fury road    what i mean by this is that i havent seen a game changer to the genre in a long time  maybe the last time was the bourne identity or even the matrix  these two films inspired elements in other films for years and some we still see today  daniel craigs bond would be nothing without the jason bourne films  and wed be damned not to see influences in more action flicks with the help of mad max fury road  its that damn good    its a straight chase actioner but because the universe is setup with the type of mutants youd see in a post apocalyptic world you get some very interesting characters  dont let anyone tell you differently this movie has characters with range and archs  nicholas hoults nux  charlize therons furiosa will steal the showand maybe your heart tom hardy is great in the role of max but for the story hes just sort of along for the ride charlize is the star of this movie  if youve seen this flick no one is saying women arent complete badasses also see emily blunt in edge of tomorrow    in the action movie hollywood of today i never thought id see a movie with such daring practical effects again and george millers stunts work so well it was as if i was seeing them for the first time on film  which of course is not the case  before the land of cgi and green screens all we ever saw was this sort of practical actionpiece  but never to the extent that miller creates with fury road    oh and you know whats crazier george freaking miller at the age of 70 walks off of doing the happy feet movies to come back to the ultra violent colourful world of mad max  not to mention 30 years after thunderdome  mr miller you have my unparalleled respect  see this movie now
May 22 2015,positive,this film was brilliantly handled so well done granted youd need to absorb a lot of chaos  post apocalyptic scenarios but its so wonderfully filmed  has a solid story structure 
May 22 2015,positive,its pretty much a 2 hour car chase packed with incredible action and insanity but with a solid story to justify all of it tom hardy takes over the role of max seamlessly and charlie theron more than holds her own as the co lead
May 22 2015,positive,there will never be another movie like mad max fury roadsome kind of a miracle
May 22 2015,positive,a visual feast of epic madness
May 22 2015,negative,the best thing i can say about this movie was that i didnt walk out the cinematography was impressive as was the action sequences in fact the entire movie was one big action sequence so i guess that if you like movies like fast and furious then this was a masterpiece which judging from the number of 5 star reviews this was the majority of the audience that went to see this film the plot is minimal  a car chase away and a car chase back the acting was a mixed bag a couple of minor characters did a surprisingly good job but the leads tom hardy and charlize theron were terrible anyone could have played the tom hardy character max and he didnt have any intelligible lines charlize theron acted like i need this paycheck so ill say my lines and use my pouty face one thing that was jarring was the way everyone else in the movie had a postapocalytic australian accent while theron sounded like a valley girl suffering from clinical depression this was an ultraviolent bombastic overthetop theater of the grotesque i couldnt turn awayso 2 stars
May 22 2015,positive,we have been waiting for the bonkers world to come back for 30 odd years and  wow amazing
May 22 2015,positive,after watching the fantastic fury road for a second time at the cinema i can rightly say that i would be furious if a sequel never saw the light of day
May 22 2015,negative,didnt like it it basically had a woman saving a useless man is that what we want our boys to group up to be waiting for the princess in her shiny robotic arm coming to save him loool
May 22 2015,positive,best movie of the year
May 22 2015,positive,pretty much a flawless action film pretty much non stop from start to finish
May 22 2015,positive,mad crazy fun turned up to eleventystupid
May 22 2015,positive,good but not great charlize theron seems like a miscast id recommend watching 1  2 at the least before watching this film as there are quite a few subtle tie ins that will elevate your enjoyment of this installment in the mad max serious
May 22 2015,positive,what a crazy in your face movie this is non stop action and breathtaking set design keep the adrenaline flowing the whole length of the film there are some gripes i have like the main character of max we dont really feel much sympathy for him because we dont know much about him in the whole movie he says maybe 20 lines charlize theron makes for a much more interesting character
May 21 2015,positive,an apocalyptic masterpiece i cant wait for more mad max movies epic stunts crazy action and just enough story to give it substance tom hardy does mel gibson proud and a stellar performance but charlize theron
May 21 2015,positive,this is another level of cinematic you can feel everything the sound the music the photography the adrenaline the power of the motors awesome is just a little description great trip
May 21 2015,positive,one of the most exhilarating films ive ever seen
May 21 2015,positive,action caked from start to finish and the action itself is really put together well some of it is mental like the guy playing a flamethrower guitar on the front of a truck during chase scenes but it all fits the look and feel not much of a story as such but you wont  be bored as its relentless one of the best action films in years  give it a watch
May 21 2015,negative,stupid movie horrible acting tom hardy says like two words in the entire movie hollywood movies keep getting worse and worse no story line horrible acting all cgi bullshit over the top special effects that undermines the movie we need more movies like shawshank casino godfather carlitos way a separation we need to focus back on the storyline and the acting the older supermans with christopher reeve or the indiania jones had better special effects and more realistic characters because you connected with them enjoyed the dialogue ie gene hackman as the villain etc     too bad hollywood keeps moving towards sequels that suck comic book cgi crap and movies with shitty story lines and dialogue 
May 21 2015,positive,fun thrilling great acting especially by theron and hardy and nice to see that the main antagonist immortan joe is portrayed by hugh  keaysbyrne who played toecutter in the original mad max what a lovely film indeed
May 21 2015,positive,having liked the earlier mad max movies as a kid i was hoping to be bowled over with the new edition the movie is very fast paced exciting and awesome production values but it didnt hook me the way other flicks of this genre did perhaps it was because of the inconsistent depth of characters or the lack of realism  in dystopian future where water is in short supply  the women look like models at a photoshoot p and the warriors are all clean shaven with no body hair most with washboard abs but yes it is exciting has mad action and is a fun way to spend a couple of hours i just did not find myself immersed in the story
May 21 2015,neutral,visually very good but poorsilly and a bit boring storyline for me  totally wasted tom hardys acting talent also he hardly utters a word
May 21 2015,positive,not what expected but great movie it makes young connected and tense from the beginning until the end
May 21 2015,positive,this strangely cerebral fantasy drama of depraved humanity with only a seemingly small remnant of civilized humans was 100 captivating  reasonably good acting and stuntsgraphics only added to its portrait of our future  well worth seeing
May 21 2015,positive,the bar has been raised a new standard is set i will never be able to watch another action movie or any movie with an action sequence the same way again
May 21 2015,positive,maxed out madness strap on and go for the visually stunning ride hail v8
May 21 2015,positive,thrill ride extravaganza
May 21 2015,positive,mad max fury road is one of the best films i have ever seen me being 18 from start to finish it sucked you in and took you on a joyride there were strong performances all around from tom hardy charlize theron and nicholas hoult the little use of cgi just adds to the realism of the crazy world that is mad max there are many visually stunning moments in this film where you just look at the movie screen in aw this movie is definitely a must see and should not be missed
May 21 2015,negative,i watched the trailer and i was like no this looks like a boring movie but then i saw the high ratings here and got curious so i decided to watch the movie and i hope i didnt because i was right at the beginning this is the most boring and stupid  movie ever it doesnt even have a story waste of time and money
May 21 2015,positive,absolutely insane and fun  check it out
May 21 2015,positive,pure action buckle up
May 21 2015,positive,one of the best action movies ive seen in a long time  a must see for sure
May 21 2015,positive,amazing in every aspect
May 21 2015,positive,oh what a film what a lovely film
May 21 2015,positive,excellent new age cinematography mixed with old school rules of actually filming entire sequencesmad max fury road is crystal clear and full of amazing stunt work with no corners cut and no severe cgi dependencies also a great call back to the original trilogy without being bogged down very very fun to watch
May 21 2015,negative,not good beautiful scenes horrible max
May 21 2015,positive,wacky unapologetic fun movie with great actors
May 21 2015,negative,im just clearly not a fan
May 21 2015,positive,awesome spectacular and surprisingly heartfelt george miller brings the best installment of the franchise thanks to a modern update and continuous action sequences that makes this one of the best action movies of all time
May 21 2015,positive,upon watching the road warrior i assumed that the rougharoundtheedges lowbudget look to the whole affair was part of the charm at least it looks like budgetary constraints to a modern audience it turns out that the only thing holding the road warrior back was a huge pile of money and a light technological touchup mad max fury road uses the road warrior as a baseline and takes it to its natural conclusion a riptide of cars guns and hellfire that starts thirty seconds in and keeps going for two hour straight its not without its missteps and some of its flourishes fall flat but overall miller has shown us exactly how good a postapocalyptic joyride can be
May 21 2015,positive,its a great 2 hour movie about a car chase in the desert
May 21 2015,positive,nonstop action and adrenaline right until the very end surprising amount of storyline amongst all the action sequences amazing stunts and special effects make for a true cinematic experience watched it in 3d and it was worth the extra those specks of sand flying everywhere and things flying in your face couldnt have looked any better great acting and a good cast
May 21 2015,positive,why everyone is ranting and raving about this movie is completely beyond me first off its so freaking long its long and you feel like your watching the same scene over and over again for the most part the movie is 99 things exploding and 1 conversation to the point where it took for 45 minutes to kinda understand what the movie is about and about an hour and a half to really grasp the plot granted the action scenes aka whole movie is filmed excellently but that doesnt make up for the rest of what was wrong with it it was somewhat entertaining but after about an hour and a half i just wanted the movie to be over its good to see if you want to just go and watch things explode for two and a half hours and not have to do a whole lot of listening
May 21 2015,positive,solid shocker of the year went in with zero interest but left sated  when a hero can convey a story with little to no lines its a good movie
May 21 2015,positive,tom hardy is an excellent choice to take over as max from mel gibson  the film finds the future bleak indeed with genetic mutations throughout and fuel and water the gold of commerce  charlize theron is a feminist with one arm from the apocolyptic future she more mad than max and totally kicks ass and takes names  the stunts are eye poppingly fantastic and make up editing and weapons top notch  the action is non stop the 3d effects work well and debris flys off the screen into your face  it is full of mayem and violence but it is not hard to look at gruesome bloody or gorey  dont miss max
May 21 2015,positive,wow that movie was intense   i liked it a lot but dont go to relax  white makeup was a bummer otherwise i loved it acting was actually decent
May 21 2015,positive,such a great movie with great action scenes and great characters tom hardy and charlize theron especially give great performances
May 21 2015,positive,absolutely incredible nothing is this original and equally entertaining anymore
May 21 2015,positive,left the theater thinking it could of been better woke up the next day realizing i watched a great movie
May 21 2015,positive,the perfect amount of crazy story and action
May 21 2015,positive,with hollywood making more and more reboots and seeing how so many turn out mad max was an oasis a visually stunning movie with some great stunts really make you have fun in the theater
May 21 2015,negative,dont waste your money just see the originals
May 21 2015,positive,what a movie what a movie a pure epic movie to watch over and over again absolute genius work by george miller the script was masterful the actors were great   this is a pure action movie you wont be disappointed at all
May 21 2015,positive,pretty bad ass great action sequences real stunts
May 21 2015,positive,very very good movie edge of your seat and great story it was action packed with very creative scenes the mad max character was done so well i literally want to go see it again right now
May 21 2015,positive,it was very well done but the genre does not particularly appeal to me great action stunning visuals
May 21 2015,positive,3 stars but no shirtless tom hardy so a final score of 1 boner out of 5
May 21 2015,positive,is it just a car race movie
May 21 2015,positive,best action film ive ever scene in relation to car overall great movie could have had more plot little less action more background story would have made this great great rating
May 21 2015,positive,im a huge fan of the original mad max trilogyroad warrior has been viewed by myself on multiple multiple occasionsthank god this new max is more to road warrior and less to thunderdome  it has moments but was toned down maxthis is essentially a two hour chase that is never boring reinvents several aspects of the chase and visually stunning in it scopei will also say it is one of the better 3d films that has been donemost looks like miller wanted a 3d movieif you like your chase i cant think there will be better this year
May 21 2015,positive,what a lovely lovely day the fourth installment in the mad max series lives up to all the hype surrounding it entirely the writing acting set design costume design cinematography and above all george millers direction are all highly imaginative and extremely well executed it appears miller hasnt lost a step when it comes to conveying the outlandish over the top and entirely maddening fury road is sure to put a smile on fans of the original films as well as introduce the world of mad mac to a younger generation unaware of their existence in my opinion it is quite literally one of the greatest action movies in recent history perhaps the entire 21st century its certainly the most high octane movie ive seen in recent memory providing a feeling in viewing it most accurately comparable to mainlineing pure adrenaline the movie moves gracefully between extreme suspense cheer worthy action sequences and moments of unutterable beauty this is achieved through a combination of fascinating characters sets and costumes designed down to the smallest details and electric editing and direction on millers behalf that being said the movie is not without fault if i was to have any criticism of the film it would be the fact max the titular character functions as almost a supporting character while giving much attention and screen time to charlize therons character furiosa fortunately therons performance is sharp to a tee and enigmatic enough to keep our attention and this criticism has absolutely nothing to to with hardys performance it was wonderful so wonderful that i craved more and while i understand that the point of this movie was just pure extravagance and it works i would have appreciated a little more dialogue and development in max all around a must see a truly magnificent achievement in modern film making
May 21 2015,positive,mad max fury road is fantastically strange intriguing and nearly perfect productionwise but doesnt have much variety in terms of tone
May 21 2015,positive,narrating my name is max my world is reduced to a single instinct survive as the world fell it was hard to know who was more crazy me or everyone else   the verdict is in and george millers relaunch of the mad max franchise fury road is the 21st century smash hit that no audience member nor fanboy can deny mad max fury road is like an adrenaline shot to the chest from straight out of pulp fiction it has energy it has combustion mad max fury road is a brilliantly choreographed chaotic masterpiece  from the jump the film takes off running literally max tom hardy is captured by a gang of war boys and the first of many chase sequences is him battling his way out of the catacombs of the citadel the oasis of his storied postapocalyptic wasteland  the citadel is the home and sanctuary of immortan joe a maniacal warlord with many devote followers and countless victims one of them is his daughter imperator furiosa charlize theron but soon however the tables would be turned on immortan joe furiosa has a plan a plan of vengeance and selfredemption   the special effects are absolutely phenomenal the contrast of night and day is reflected beautifully in shades of teal and orange and the obstacles of the wasteland are enough to put on your heels and just say  wow   the only way someone could even think about sleeping on this movie is if they have narcolepsy and i doubt itd even be possible for them to tune out on fury road its that captivating its that enthralling and it has all the elements of the mad max franchise that has kept it going for over 35 years   the needle has been injected the adrenaline is pumping through his veins its official  mad max is alive and well and its been kicked up a notch
May 21 2015,positive,it is just a well made without too much cgi movie  loved the way it approached women as action heroes imperator furiosa and nux are bewildering and mesmerizing characters
May 21 2015,positive,awesome movie with non stop action
May 21 2015,positive,believe the hype maybe the most artfully done action movie ive ever seen as long as you can appreciate the burning manesque postapocalyptic freak show aesthetic the back story is surprisingly rich as well especially considering that 90 of the movie is just an elaborate chase scene
May 21 2015,positive,i feel like theres a huge revival of classic movie franchises going on right now some have been good some bad the new addition to the mad max series fury road is one that belongs to the good category if youve ever seen a mad max film you probably know a lot of what to expect with this film but i will say that of all the others this one seems to have the most meaningful story with the most heart to it the new characters are excellent and the actors chosen to portray them were spot on i think my favorite new character was nux portrayed by nicholas hoult hoult has been a powerhouse lately and hes not letting up any for this role in terms of action this is one of the best films ive seen in a long while the action sequences are intense gritty personal and very realistically done which is refreshing in this day and age of all cg action films the atmosphere and feel of the film is exactly what i would hope to see in a mad max film its gritty dirty harsh and brutal i will say though that just like any other of the mad max films fury road is not for everyone the bizarre and ugly nature of the environment and conditions of the world of this film are kind of unsettling in ways but it does the story a proper service and adds to the concept well all in all fury road is a great entry to the mad max series and worth a watch
May 21 2015,positive,a visceral insanely twisted and well crafted odyssey tom hardy and nicholas hoult are awesome but charlize theron is now just as if not more iconic than sarah connor  ellen ripley
May 21 2015,positive,one crazy awesome ride  now i just needa see it in imax
May 21 2015,positive,from start to finish i was on the edge of my seat in this thrilling action packed film that takes you in to this world of chaos and mayhem mad max fury road was an exciting film from start to finish that left me wanting more
May 21 2015,positive,this is how you do action
May 21 2015,positive,the film has gorgeous scenery cars and nonstop action  and absolutely nothing else no plot no story no character development no humor fans of mad max 2 and 3 should be disappointed
May 21 2015,negative,this was a bad moviedont waste your time
May 21 2015,positive,intense from beginning to end pure adrenaline
May 21 2015,positive,didnt love it its really really out there but that being said its quite a ride
May 21 2015,positive,perfection the capital wasteland 3
May 21 2015,positive,totally bonkers naturally i loved every second i doubt theres a better blockbuster released this year apart from star wars outstanding citnematography jaw dropping stunts non stop action prepare to be entertained
May 21 2015,positive,excellent film that manages to channel crazy intense action scenes in a way that doesnt feel repetitive or uncomfortable at any time the story is expertly crafted and unfolds at an exquisite pace the characters have a very uncommon depth to them and the world feels alive so alive that the film makes you feel as if youre there like very very few other films can in my honest opinion this is one of the best films ive ever seen everything about it is unique its filled to the top with crazy original ideas and surprising elements definitely recommended to everyone this is one of those things that need to be experienced to truly understand flawless brilliant genius
May 21 2015,positive,i have no idea where to start with this review other than to say this makes the position of die hard as my all time favorite action movie look rather uncertain for starters the action is absolutely wonderful it is not only exhilarting but shot and edited beautifully and doesnt go for the quick edit rubbish of recent action films with wide and long shots like action movies of old the score is easily the best i have heard in a long time it makes the action set pieces all the better and all the more thrilling the cast is great tom hardy really is solid in the role of max and charlize theron as imperator furiosa is easily equal in terms of not only emotion but the ability to kick just as much arse the plot is good the reliance on visuals over actual words is a great idea but where there is talking to be done the script is bang on overall this is the action movie of not just the decade but the last 25 years
May 21 2015,positive,zero character development and light on plot but visually stunning with great effects and jaw dropping stunts
May 21 2015,positive,mad max fury road is one of the greatest action movies ever made bar none  stands with the road warrior as an instant classic
May 21 2015,positive,charlize really carried this movie without her i dont think it would have been anything other than just another action movie tom physically great but thats all he really was in this very one dimensional the real depth and real guts comes from charlize and i actually felt more of a connection to mel gibsons mad max character being channelled through her than i did through tom really great watch
May 21 2015,positive,i loooove this movie so much ive seen it 3 times already the movie is so fun and politically relevant and it pisses off the mra added bonus so bring on more action movies with strong female characters so many awesome women in this movie cause clearly this movie just raised a really high bar i have not felt so compelled to see a movie in theaters this many time since the fifth element i recommend this movie to everyone and the soundtrack is amazing and the stunts are amazing and the directing is amazing have i mentioned amazing now i wish george miller was doing the jla movie furiosaforpresident
May 21 2015,positive,this is to anyone who said mad max fury road was a bad movie boooooooooooo on you it was full of action a great storyline a great cast and dont even get me started on all of the awesome vehicles id love to see more mad max movies in the future
May 21 2015,positive,if i was forced to describe it in one word id get stuck somewhere between fantastic and relentless
May 21 2015,positive,the two times i was like yes here is a thing that i dont like about this film george miller ruined it for me by making it important to the narrative and a good choice i would be quite happy to have this be looped on every television station and in every movie theater screen for the next ten years
May 21 2015,positive,an absolute action movie lover heaven great sound and direction tom hardy shouldve got a bigger role though
May 21 2015,positive,wow what a ride this movie rolls from start to finish and doesnt stop until your sitting at home on the couch not to mention a few emotional elements thrown in the mix what a great movie i think i will see it again
May 21 2015,positive,awesome chase movie great characters great stunts just and all around awesome action movie thats a breathe of fresh air from all the boring non rated r action movies of today give me more like this
May 21 2015,positive,dialogue is really weak and tom hardy does too much gruntingmumblingother than that awesome movie very entertaining action packed and i mean packed feels like an instant classic
May 21 2015,positive,excellent movie it was a pleasant surprise
May 21 2015,positive,great action movie
May 21 2015,positive,other then the endingloved it
May 21 2015,positive,the mad max film franchise is full of action and suspense that has delivered great success and a large fan base now almost 30 years after last film mad max beyond thunderdome we finally get a return to the franchise unfortunately series star mel gibson is not in this movie not even a cameo as recent events involving the actor show that mel may not be ready to return to the role he created luckily in his place we have tom hardy as our antihero for this film and he does job replacing mr gibson along with a new cast as well as the original director george miller we have the same apocalyptic setting  but in a very different universe mad max fury road is a great reboot to the franchise that was started so many years ago    the plot is set in a postapocalyptic australia where pretty much the whole land is a desert max rockatansky hardy must survive without being caught by the world of freaks that inhabit the land he just so happens to get caught and escapes to join a woman named imperator furiosa charlize theron who is driving a big rig loaded with precious cargo now its a race to stop the cargo from its destination and seeing if max is either a hero or an antihero    mad max fury road is a welcome addition to the mad max franchise however this viewer has not at this time seen any other mad max films but as an introduction fury road wasnt that bad lets start off with what makes the movie good the story is easy to follow making casual movie audiences like myself happy the cast does a surprising good job at what they delivered on the screen even nicholas hoult did a good job a one of the freaks trying to stop max in the process     the set pieces a are to look at but its the landscapes of australia that really pull you in everything feels isolated and deserted just the way the film is supposed to be the usage of cgi is minimal but when it hits that sandstorm at the beginning it definitely looks amazing this compliments the action that is happening on screen cars are blowing up guns are being fired explosions are set off and the execution to all of this is astounding to look at mad max fury road is a wellbalanced movie that delivers highquality action against a great backdrop    if there are any complaints then they are only minor and most of it concerns the story because while the story is easy to understand and follow there are some confusing elements that needed to be resolved mostly a backstory explaining what has happened but thats okay    in conclusion mad max fury road will satisfy action fans alike and hopefully bring out a new perspective on a franchise thats over 45 years in the making all thats left to say is we all go mad sometimes
May 21 2015,positive,not much of a real true story also barely any talking in the movie all what this movie is special effects and stunts glad i paid 8 bucks instead of 10
May 21 2015,positive,this is by far one of the best action movies of 2015would definitely see it again
May 21 2015,positive,nonstop action packed thrill ride that will keep you glued to the screen amazing acting and perfect sequel to the old mad max movie if you have not seen the first one you will not be lost it is definitely worth watching
May 21 2015,negative,mindless waste of time this movie only contributed to the we are killing our planet theme with the ridiculous amount of gas guzzling vehicles and explosions the idea that humanity will blindly follow and worship puss ridden sex crazed freaks is a joke movie falls more in line as a morbid comedy i truly believe all critics that rated this positively should be on our personal block list
May 21 2015,positive,watch this movie now your face will literally melt off this is the best movie of 2015 miller absolutely destroys the competition you are literally thrown into the story without regards for giving you a long prologue mad max is the movie to see 6 out of 5
May 21 2015,negative,the action is fun and wellstaged until its not but too much of the film feels like the same plot point rinsed and repeated i really dont get the praise around this one
May 21 2015,positive,tempted to give this a higher rating but as it is basically a two hour long action sequence with almost no plot i had to hold back it is very loud and intense and it did have me on the edge of my seat throughout so much so i had to do some serious underwear adjusting two thirds of the way in even if it left me dazed with ringing ears after if you like movies that make you feel like youve been to a megadeth concert youll love it 
May 21 2015,positive,it has a pretty good commentary and message that really hits home after youve watched it but during the actual movie it throws so much at the viewer that it becomes too much of a good thing the characters arent developed and it essentially boils down to a 2hour chase sequence decent but nothing great
May 21 2015,positive,quite possibly the greatest action film of the last two decades
May 21 2015,neutral,its not that its bad its just bizarre gotta see it openmindedly
May 21 2015,positive,fck almighty this is a great movie  being a child of the 80s i got to love the initial trilogy in its time and expected nothing but predictable disappointment after eventually watching it on my phone but something called out to me go ahead cynical ahole i dare you and i listened  this will piss off some fans but i dare say tom hardy is the mad max that mel gibson could never aspire to have been  within the constraints of very sparse dialogue hardy portrays such a convincingly embattled joyless hardened by loss complex character who has been broken down to the simplest form of existence without any of the tackiness of typical noblehero film conventions which even gibson relied on to remain watchable as max rockatansky and yet emerges as a much more likeable and relatable character  here ill surely piss off some more fans citing this as not only a passable reboot late sequel but undoubtedly the finest film in the series  everyone brought their agame to the table in fury road and i mean everyone right down to the editors lighting crew and probably craft service  i gotta say though as good as hardy and charlize theron are onscreen the real showstealer is hugh keaysbyrne again  the toecutter guy from 1979 as immortan joe the insanely creepilymasked villain who drives the greatest movie car of all time two cadillac coupes sandwiched together atop a monster truck chassis driven by twin boosted v8s  yeah  getting down to the core of this whole freakshow is a really unexpected and refreshing set of themes which no sane person could have taken seriously with gibson as lead and not because hes too fing old which toss away the mandatory macho heroic action movie conventions and give women at least an equal footing as moral authority and imposing physical presence  now because of this we have some clowns crying feminist propaganda when in reality its the very mechanism that turned a costly reboots almost mandatory legacy to suck on its head and allowed tom hardy to play a truly damaged mad max with complete abandon  no lighthearted peter pan sidestory here just one gritty constant and constantly entertaining action sequence
May 21 2015,positive,when judged on its own merits and not compared to the original cult classic that launched mel gibsons career mad max fury road delivers gorgeous cinematography frenetic car chases and completely immerses you in its post apocalyptic world the narrative however leaves the viewer behind and the central character seems to make one think the films title is perhaps misleading still the original screenwriter and crews remaining make something that seems to stand out among the rest of the film in the outbreak of hollywood reboots
May 21 2015,negative,one long car chase and an absurb female lead as far as plot what did max have anything to do with it should called this anything but mad max
May 21 2015,positive,in a post apocalyptic  future road warrior max hardy ends up being plunged into reluctantly helping furiosa theron  escape from immortan joe keaysbyrne as she has stolen his breeding brides and is looking to return to her homeland that she was abducted from as a child  joe and is maniacal army of war boys are soon in hot pursuit all sorts of vehicular mayhem ensues    considering i was of the age to have been exposed to the original series on vhs as it was at its height in the 80s i must confess ive only seen the first 2 films once and the 3rd one passed me by  i never really was that drawn to them although in light of fury road id be curious to catch them to see how they compare    only until really recently i was interested in seeing this theatrically the film had also had along gestation period and release date changes that youd be forgiven for thinking this might turn out a stinker the trailers had intrigued me i guess but the cinema is so expensive these days that it has to be something really good to get me parting with my money but boy was i not disappointed    the problem with allot of relaunches is that the director is usually a fan of the previous films and promises to bring something of the original spirit but then ends up shatting all over its legacy though as weve got george miller the man who held the megaphone all the previous films the odds looked better than even    miller while no spring chicken these days and not actually what youd call prolific has delivered one of the most exhilarating experiences on the big screen for sometime  while im sure cgi was employed its not saturated and the practical effects and stunts speak for themselves  millers original max the controversial mel gibson is obviously too old to fit into the role he has lucked out with tom hardy arguably one of the hottest actors on the planet at the moment as his new max a great character actor who inhabits the role but also capable of equipping himself to action nolans final bat film has many problems but hardys physical presence and prowess certainly wasnt one of them    he doesnt have a great deal to say but he certainly has plenty to do and he hits the ground running from the moment he appears  much has been said about the female element of this film some applauding and also criticising it for being a so called feminist action film  charlize theron toms co star pretty much shares the screen with him and is as equally formidable and impressive  its somewhat refreshing and probably the most formidable female action icon since ellen ripley    keaysbyrne who played the toe cutter in the original mad max is fearsome as chief immortan joe nicholas hoult also adds great support as nox  be warned though this is utterly bonkers but it keeps the spirit that i can remember from the originals and lets be honest if you are going to do this kind you cant hold back  miller has put utter mayhem on the screen and the result will having you gripping your seat the climax simply has to be seen to be believed  if you catch one film on the big screen this summer make it this one as no other format will do it justice      im no fan of 3d but have to say i cant see why youd need to the 2d version is enough like a roller coaster ride as it is  book a ticket now and see what is likely to be one of the best films of the year sam jj its over to you
May 21 2015,positive,action packednice
May 21 2015,negative,a camping we will go my take on the movies mad max fury road and in the name of my daughter 
May 21 2015,positive,just when i thought the action movie genre really couldnt do anything else new and different this proves me entirely wrong intense action distinctive style and a concrete story make this a worthy installment in the mad max series
May 21 2015,positive,george miller breathes new life in the mad max franchise in this latest installment of the postapocalyptic wasteland charlize theron is the driving force behind the film and her strong feminist character is inspiring the exhilarating action impresses audiences the most while the stunning visuals keep the audiences engaged expect more adventures of mad max in the future
May 21 2015,positive,a must see film the coolest movie ive seen in awhile
May 21 2015,positive,absolutely  absolutely 
May 21 2015,positive,absolutely  absolutely 
May 21 2015,negative,this movie was terrible
May 21 2015,positive,amazing  gritty action exciting cameos  theron  hardy were great
May 21 2015,positive,waited a long time for another mad max and this didnt disappoint
May 21 2015,positive,incredibly entertaining epic choreography and cinematography great to see a movie that isnt not entirely cgi in this day and age i didnt watch the old mad maxs growing up as a kid but now id like to watch them to see the story arc this is a movie you must see in imax if you can the sound and visuals were stunning
May 21 2015,positive,worth the acclaim its getting the film focuses mainly on the survival of the protagonists and theres lots of action id even say its better than the avengers 2 this film wouldnt have been rated r if not for some of the violence in a few scenes
May 21 2015,negative,sloppy directing and overhyped this movie would have done better 20 years ago but action movie goers deserve better now
May 21 2015,positive,everything about this movie was relevant to the original franchise in that it conducted itself in the same way that the original discovered  a barren wasteland seemingly endless and devoid of life meaningless to us mumbo jumbo about valhalla and dystopian jargon related to wasteland survivial function over style road warrior machines cleverly adapted to chase down and destroy prey a society ruled by a ruthless warlord who reserves precious resources for the nuclear infested masses all of it there
May 21 2015,positive,mad max   max friggin max  where the hell do i even begin with this    it was motherfcking epic  holy shit the cars were like eeeeeeeeee verrrrrm kaboom  tom hardy was like  and everything was just brilliant
May 21 2015,positive,i must be missing something as so many people loved this film i thought it was one long chase scene with a bunch of explosions what a waste of a great cast american movies have become senselessly violent for some time now but this one wow the tale could have been told in such a different way the people totally enslaved by the villians these horribly unattractive brothers were simply without any power the suggestion that humans can live without water was absurd beyond belief but apparently people did believe this vision of the apocalypse it had none of the wit or charm of the original mad max films visually it was mostly grotesque the was a part where furiosa finds her people and the women who acted as those surviving peoples were interesting well acted too and the initial scene where she identifies herself is moving revealing of who she once had been but why do people love this film i was exhausted when i left the cinema i felt totally dejected after viewing so much ugliness so much killing cannabalism it was a picture of hell a horror movie really dont take your kids
May 21 2015,positive,wow this movie rocks
May 21 2015,neutral,it was rango but with people complete with turtle man like they said lets see how many cars we can use to make freakishmobiles and how many deformed and deranged people we can imagine from a nuclear fallout then toss in some live car stereo all made from the imagination of a 6 year old thatll work i likes it when they run
May 21 2015,positive,tom hardy replaces 1970s80s action star mel gibson in the title role as max rockatansky  max is a former policeman now road warrior in a post apocalypse australia a barren country at the best of times is now overrun by scavenging humans whose sole outlook is survival and an ever dwindling supply of gasoline  the film has received excellent reviews and has even opened the cannes film festival  now call me a sentimental old git however i cant get the original mad max films out of my head and i prefer gibsons incarnation  with films like this which are forever being churned out you must try and distinguish it from the original  there is however one source of continuity director george miller returns he is into his seventies  the film is one long chase the stuntwork  by the drivers is excellent  apparently hardy is signed up to another two sequels but i honestly dont know where the story of max can go  for me personally it seemed more beyond thunderdome than road warrior at the start and end if you know what i mean
May 21 2015,positive,the best postapocalyptic film ever cartoonish without being absurd violent without being gratuitous heroic without being ludicrous
May 21 2015,positive,i have always been a fan of the mad max movies  this one is at the top of my list  the nice thing is we already know maxs story so we get to see how he evolves as a protector a little more  very nice movie
May 21 2015,positive,oh what a filmwhat a lovely film
May 21 2015,positive,is the best movie i have seen in years  the only other movie that gave me the same feeling of wonder and amazement immediately after leaving the theater was first jurassic park  if you havent seen it go see it i cant get it out of my head    there is little to no cgi in this one scene when they go into a dust storm and the way they do it is amazing  all of the vehicles are real and distinct the stunts are real the story is simple yet captivating  the dialogue is minimal yet perfect the acting is superb  the directing and cinematography are sublime and no one is a super ninja or super hero its all believable action which actually raises the stakes you know a spin kick wont get them out of this    mad max immediately ruined ruined avengers 2 and all my other favorite super hero movies  its the movie of the year  go see it  itll probably ruin the new star wars too    70 year old george miller has raised the bar for these young directorsand they wont reach it  old man just through his giant blank on the table and jj joss and zack are cowering in the corner
May 21 2015,positive,one of the best movies of the year breathtaking amazing visuals brilliant performances outrages action george miller has finally refreshed the 21st century of film
May 21 2015,positive,mad max fury road is a great action movie weaving high stakes thrills with slick special effects tom hardys max may be the main character but charlize therons furiosa steals the show while the story is pretty onedimensional the intensity built around it and the mad flurries of conflict make it a great ride its an adrenaline rush kind of a movie a full speed chase movie across a broken world with plenty of blood and explosions to satisfy mad max fury road knows exactly what kind of movie it is and delivers on the goods
May 21 2015,positive,amazingly well made film total action ride
May 21 2015,positive,this was good but not sure it rates a 90 rating
May 21 2015,positive,great great movie well choreographed scenes one of my contenders for movie of the year
May 21 2015,negative,the action was second to none however the lack of story line and verbal interaction meant the film left a lot to be desired
May 21 2015,positive,this movie was great
May 21 2015,positive,relentless awesome relentlessly awesome i cannot remember the last time ive seen such an amazing action film     an utter classic a new standard oh that soundtrack that editing that cinematography and that direction mr miller you mastermind     max really does play second fiddle to charlize therons furiosa a feminist hero second to none and just what the hell is some peoples problem with that    great to see some aussie legends in there too like john howard and richard carter and quentin kenihan    day 1 instabuy
May 21 2015,positive,great action sequences and fight scenes but a bit limited on dialogue and backstory of the main characters great fun though
May 21 2015,positive,despite the title and billing this is furiosas charlie therons film and it is her road were on  max just happens to be on it this new feminist approach to rebooting this franchise as it turns out is a rather fresh and intriguing idea that works relentless and breathtakingly paced where one visually stunning set piece follows another and yet another proving that you cannot have too much adrenalinfuelled action if they are staged this effectively and spectacularly the choice to use less cgi in favour of more inventive stunts and real effects is the other reason why this movie will stand out from other similar action thrillers you will see this year  with the thinnest of story literally to and back again and a less talk more action approach this is high octane overthetop entertainment that i happily lost 2 hours to
May 21 2015,positive,amazeballs so so so wild of a ride
May 21 2015,positive,magnificent to a million magnitudes     firstly do not be fooled by the seemingly dull orange desert the story is set in george miller visionary finds a way to make a barren wasteland into one of the most beautiful movie settings ive seen ever sand flows like water dust dancing in a sandstorm this film does not lack visceral visual stimulation by any means in fact supplement the cinematography with the operatic action and chase sequences and we end up with a finished product that keeps the audience at the edge of their seats throughout film speaking of the action sequences the special effects are the thing of wonder remember the hobbit trilogy how the whole saga looked like one long videogame cutscene this film is not that thank the movie gods for that this film looks very organic it was obvious cars were actually being smashed to pieces and stuntmen were hired of course there are a few justifiable exceptions to thiscgi is almost always needed and i mean that literally in every genre yes even romcomsbut even those parts didnt seem gimmicky for example there is a scene early in the film where we find ourselves in the middle of a giant sandstorm instead of taking me out of the film the special effects actually worked and i felt as if i were also inside the stormthe bottom line is this go watch this movie in theatres or you will regret it it is meant to be seen on the silver screen    now lets get to the plot its simple as it is meant to be a straightforward action film to my preference it does a good job of not needing to explain every little thing of the whys and hows of the diegetic world for example presumably the war boys are called halflives because they constantly need blood transfusions or they will die we can discern this because they are all pale and implicitly not considered to be born normal yet it is not the plot that fascinated me from a writers standpoint but the intricacies and the meticulousness needed to create a dystopian world such as this one granted that this is the fourth chapter in the saga still this one has clearly revamped the world into a place even more desolate and dangerous than before despite being out of place in space and in time we as the audience or at least most of us can relate to the situation of our protagonists they live in a world where a select few own virtually all resources and wealth those in power are only there because of chauvinism and nepotism the plebeians are merely given as much as needed to survive and nothing more besides the ruling class everybody is either a sex slave or just as slave literally everybody needs to fight to stay alive even max the one who is second to none so different our wolds are and yet oh so similar  surprisingly though there are moments in the dialogue that i found to be a little redundant at times the protagonists would simply state the obvious for the sake of reiterating the current situation it was a bit unsettling but more so humorous these lines were delivered a bit unnaturally and understandably so because not all of the actors in the film were topnotch still and maybe i am being a bit clement here but ultimately this was not a big deal to me       speaking of the actors tom hardy is straight up gangsta ive always been a fan ever since watching warrior and man did he deliver not that there is relatively too much to do in this film in regards to acting especially since hes played unstable and insane people in the past but he does play mad very well and its hard to fit in mel gibsons mad max shoes you really do have to have a certain level of charisma to get people to like psychopathicbutrelatable murdering survivalists nevertheless max is but thrust into the story without his own volition furiosa therons character is who drives the plot thus technically making her the true heroine of this narrative maxs psychological profile is standard in some ways screws loose in the head because of some past trauma and now all he does is survive thats how he starts the film and its how he ends the film his only real development as a character is that he learns to make new friends furiosa is the one out for redemption she is the one with the mission and unfortunately for her it is harder practically than theoretically to succeed there were many moments where i felt that she had truly been defeated only to see her triumph once again badass   surprisingly from an acting standpoint i would have to give the best performance to hoults nux he plays at mutinous war boy i dont want to give too much of the story but talk about playing crazy man i thought mad max was of his rocker wait until you get a load of the war boys      finally the music i loved the score and i mean really loved the score ive only ever bought the official soundtrack to one film before this one im buying it tonight and that movie was star trek into darkness my favorite is the same music they used for the trailer its upbeat and modern with its electronica hardcore in a heavy metal sense and epically operatic i cant get enough of it if you need something to pump you up for a workout or rev you up in the morning i recommend listening to the soundtrack     a highly visceral dystopian opera that wont dull with multiple viewings truly spectacular george miller    splendid from top to finish if i had to describe the film it would be include the adjectives intense thrilling and charismatic     yes that and then mix it with a little bit of movie magic and you get mad max fury road     one for the ages     44 stars     winner of the                   just a thought amaranth classic award     just a thought     see you in valhalla p  v8
May 21 2015,positive,a frantic frenetic postapocalyptic romp that sets a new bar for the cinematic chase scene in a way tarantino could only imagine of doing in death proof  the mythology of the film isnt explicitly explained and the story is patchy although this comes across as carefully meted out rather that slapdash as is so common in the action genre  it works for the most part but the juxtaposition of foregrounded action and barely mentioned plot does start to wear out its welcome before the end  if anything the films biggest issue is that the whole story could be told without its central character tom hardy is a performer who disappears inside his characters playing a protagonist whos more cypher than hero he all but disappears in the company of strong personalities like charlize theron and nicholas hoult  a film that needs to be judged on its own merits but one that still could have been better
May 21 2015,positive,mad max fury road is a milestone in the genre of action it is exactly what i wanted from a mad max film an action opera that is fun exhilarating and suprisingly emotional at times mad max also succeeds to create strong female characters which is rare in action films these days mad max is a perfect film in my opinion and obviously deserves my perfect grade
May 21 2015,positive,way worth the wait very intense movie but that rope burn thoughyikes
May 21 2015,positive,an old school action movie thats fueled on adrenaline
May 21 2015,positive,fantastic action film visually stunning low on story line but hey  go and be blown away for 2 hours
May 21 2015,positive,its one thing when you expect a summer action to deliver avengers but its more exciting when one delivers you arent so familiar with    beginning to end one of the best pure chase movies wonderful visuals and acrobatic stunts that dont remind you of anything both stately and subliminal comments on society  fascinating narrative with shades of the biblical exodus all while during one guitar rockin car chase
May 21 2015,negative,sorry but i thought this was bloody awful cringeworthy at some points i wont be going back for any more maybe its just me but i hated it complete lack of a plot corny and as for bloke with the guitar wtf
May 21 2015,positive,who would have thought that this long overdue fourth installment of a 30 year old franchise would turn out to be one of the most fun and awe inspiring movie experiences of the summer i applaud the fact that they did most of the stunts practically and just used cg to enhance it it gives the film a more tactical and grounded feeling which is sorely lacking in the computer generated monstrosities of late
May 21 2015,positive,most epic and coolest retarded movie i ever saw
May 21 2015,positive,this movie will melt your face off
May 21 2015,positive,masterpiece oscar winner
May 21 2015,positive,im trying to think of something deep and appropriate but honestly i cant this is just such an awesome deep and rare movie that omg its amazing
May 21 2015,positive,this is easily one of the best action movies to come out in recent times and quite possibly of all time though that can be debated the action set pieces are grand in scale carrying a punch that is hard to come by in modern big budget blockbusters due to the amount of cgi luckily mad max furry road opts to go practical effects over visual aiding in the sense of danger however there is enough of a narrative and human emotion to carry the movie as well as the audience through an adrenaline fueled thrill ride also despite the name of the movie the hero will always be guitar guy
May 20 2015,positive,mad max was always on my radar i saw the original when i was very young and didnt think too much of it what stuck with me most was the third installment of mad max beyond thunderdome it was the silliness behind it all so here we are 30 years later with yet another installment of mad max with as much original pieces to the puzzle as possible and the ending result is it was really good but not amazing to me i am really rough critic when doling out near perfect scores first off let me say that i commend george milller for coming back 30 years later and doing this for us again i also appreciate the work of hugh keaysbyrne and his awesome portrayal as immortan joe i may be one of the biggest tom hardy fans on the planet as i love everything that man is in and he picked up the reigns as gibsons mad max and really made it his own so kudos to him the story was slim but action packed for sure lets sum it down to it was a great movie but missing that one piece to really make it perfect i do recommend the watch though 455
May 20 2015,positive,a refreshingly exhilarating dangerfilled thrillride made up of breathtaking practical effectsvisuals and locals the interesting  unique caricaturelike character designs combined with a simple straightforward story that does have some underlying thoughtful themes make this movie a must see
May 20 2015,negative,the most massively overrated and hyped up movie i have seen for many years fantastic direction and editing very good special effects and some great 3d shots and also credible acting and solid characters unfortunately it lacked something important  substance and logic if you look closely you can see why the characters are what they are and you can understand what is going on and why but the questions still remains  what is the point like some people who look so deep into a painting that they can see jesus andor the univers this movie has brought out a lot of technical praise but imo i saw it for what it was  and that is yet another pointless sequelprequel type movie drawing sucking off the success of its ground breaking predecessor mad max had a point  there is no point in this movie  just a series of action and effects mixed in with some interesting characters and their redemption nothing new here  and my advice to those who see things as groundbreaking  is to step back a bit and take a better big picture look again it has all been done before  and done better
May 20 2015,positive,as an action movie its pretty cool lots of great shots and wide angles of the scenery and well staged sequences but for the main character max i kept forgetting he was supposed to be the star of the movie charlize had more screen time so for that its a bit of a fail given shes not even the main character she was far more interesting good movie but not 98 good as the reviews give it
May 20 2015,negative,its a 2 hour truck chase and then the truck turns around to go home  super meh with some good action scenes  very dissapointed
May 20 2015,positive,george miller is a genius  his vision of this universe is so detailed and deep it had to wait this long for technology to catch up to depict it   the high contrast of dystopian view and the power to live is extremely dramatic  well represented visually and audibly  the japanese comic book fist of the north was highly influenced by the original mad max movies but this latest one is exactly what that comic book was trying to describe  charlize theron and tom hardy are just so great  didnt notice until i read imdb that the villain is the same actor as the original mad max movies villain which is awesome  already preordered 3d bd on amazon but i will likely see this in the theaters again before bd
May 20 2015,positive,quite possible the greatest landmark action film of the decade
May 20 2015,positive,merciful heavens the action was so intense and nonstop that it felt like i was hyperventilating whilst on speed in the middle of an ef3 tornado mad max fury road is utterly brilliant the story is minimalist in all the right ways and lets be honest max was fine but this movie was owned by charlize theron as furiosa goddamn it theron was too good in this movie the stink and horribleness of thunder dome is gone and mad max is back in top form
May 20 2015,positive,if there was ever a perfect action film this is it i finally watched birdman last night and the funny thing is mad max was better
May 20 2015,positive,i still cant figure out whether i really like this movie or cant stand it it is like going on the tallest roller coaster in the world for the first and scared to death the entire time afterwords you feel great but your not sure if you would ride it again if that makes any since
May 20 2015,positive,by now almost everyone has heard about the absolutely insane action sequences of mad max fury road and its all true  they are incredible and unlike anything i can remember seeing on the big screen the way george miller stylistically shoots and stitches them together cranking to 11 is highly unique and has to be experienced to be believed to top it off tom hardy and charlize theron are perfect dramatic fits for their roles while miller adds some nice symbolical weight to the proceedings so its more than one big car chase i cant even begin to imagine how demanding the shoot was and the fact everyone was able to pull it off at all let alone in the manner in which they did is mindboggling
May 20 2015,positive,buckle up for a twohour highoctane twohour ride
May 20 2015,positive,valhalla awaits the doof warrior
May 20 2015,positive,if you want to take a crazy ride head down fury road doesnt get much crazier than this
May 20 2015,positive,holy shit snax wait till i tell pam at the office about this one cheryl will probably be high on those  gummy bears
May 20 2015,positive,visually stunning but no real story or plot however it is mad max so i didnt go in there expecting one must see in theatres and worth the admission great to see practical effects in film again much appreciated
May 20 2015,positive,really enjoyed this looking forward to the next one
May 20 2015,positive,this is what all action movies from here on out should try to live up to
May 20 2015,positive,this far exceeded my expectations rare but id see this a second time
May 20 2015,positive,mad max starts out with a chilling narration and a suspenseful chase this largely represents the entire film the movie is certainly thrilling from beginning to end the story follows a rogue survivor in a postapocalyptic world who joins an escaping convoy of women to defeat the evil ruler of the new world the characters are all well played my greatest applause goes to tom hardy charlize theron nicholas hoult and hugh keaysbryne  read the full review at   benlikesmovieswordpresscom
May 20 2015,positive,this is clearly a cinematic masterpiece  using a limited amount of cgis miller revitalizes his franchise with the best action movie since terminator 2  but lets face it folks todays standards for a film like this are way higher  george miller delivers a post apocalyptic world of high octane carnage  huge performance by charlize theron and the sky is the limit for tom hardy after this film
May 20 2015,positive,it was amazing i loved every second of it it kept me on the edge of my seat pretty much the whole movie
May 20 2015,positive,special effects were good but charlize theron gave wooden performance and her character was annoying warm bodies actor played good part but tom hardy one of my fave actors and who i went to see movie for as max was wasnt best decision ever made pretty good story but hollywood heres a tip  if it aint broke dont fix it original movie was way better fave character was the guitarist on truck hahah
May 20 2015,positive,probably the best in the series and tom hardy is what mel gibson would have liked to have been
May 20 2015,positive,awesomesauce incredible and i want to watch it again
May 20 2015,positive,incredible crazy insanely entertaining epic   how no one died while filming this picture is the miracle  old school action at 80 mph buckle up it one heck of a trip
May 20 2015,positive,update oh wait i forgot to mention the ridiculously awesome metal soundtrack its soul rattling i love the road warrior its one of my favorite movies ever i also really enjoy mad max and beyond thunderdome so when i heard george miller was dusting off his franchise and bringing max rockatansky back to the big screen i was very excited that was several years ago and mel gibson was set to return as the road warrior then he flipped out i dont know if thats what put the movie on the back burner for so long but im sure it didnt help flash forward nearly a decade and tom hardy has taken mels place and charlize theron and miller have crafted a new postapocolyptic badass in furiosa this movie is a ton of fun wall to wall nutsy craziness however be careful to understand the context when you see words like masterpiece which is what this flick is being called it is an action masterpiece for sure but it is not without its problems understand my concerns are very minor and in no way did it lessen my enjoyment of this flick the characters are a little underdeveloped and the story is pretty weak but it doesnt matter because the action in this movie is on par with the best ever filmed this stunt team deserves a special award maybe even an award named after them these men and women risked life and limb to give us a show and a show they gave us takes your breath away is a mild way to put it see it on imax trust me
May 20 2015,positive,fanfreakingtastic nuff said
May 20 2015,positive,its a whirlwind in all the best and worst ways whatever its faults though its unforgettable how many films can claim that
May 20 2015,positive,ranging from tom hardys all seven lines to the offbeat culture of the mad max world this film does a fine job as the films comeback into the 21st century
May 20 2015,positive,weird and petty stupid movie but had cool action scenes
May 20 2015,positive,thank you george miller thank you
May 20 2015,positive,can a mad max movie be better than the first can a mad max movie be all about cinemaart can a mad max movie be jaw dropping throughout the whole movie can a mad max movie be about feminism can a mad max movie be a rage against the patriarchy yes it can so just go to the theater right now and watch this spectacle over and over and over again thank you miller for this movie this is not a reboot not a remake this is movie history being made
May 20 2015,positive,a damn near perfect action film its exciting and it has a surprising emotional heft that none of the previous mad max films have had the rest of the summer movie season can go to hell i got what i wanted from this film and then some
May 20 2015,positive,it was okay  nothing special
May 20 2015,positive,tom hardy ââ and charlize theron ââ are awesome
May 20 2015,positive,cant say enough good things about this film
May 20 2015,positive,i loved the fact that his movie is just one huge chase
May 20 2015,negative,boring boring boring a tedious drone of endless noise and driving with plot holes large enough to drive the pointless vehicles through mindless and uninteresting
May 20 2015,positive,this is definitely the most metal movie ive seen all year and is most definitely a worthy entry into the mad max series combining amazing action scenes with a surprising amount of character development for both max as well as nearly every other major character all combined with glorious practical effects has lead to the creation of one of the most amazingly overthetop films of all time this is a movie where the main villain has a guy strapped to a truck specifically so he can play an electric guitar which doubles as a flamethrower as his army drive after max furiosa and immortan joes wives i have no doubt that this film has flaws somewhere in it but there is so much that distracts me from that with explosions amazing fight choreography interesting ideas about postapocalyptic life as well as a good helping of development to all the central characters all make it overcome whatever flaws it has fury road is amazing and was most definitely mad in all senses of the word
May 20 2015,positive,i loved loved this movie i didnt think i would like it not a scifi fan casting was spot on   i dont think it was suppose to be funny but i laughed at the absurdities of some of the scenes
May 20 2015,positive,exciting film definitely worth a watch
May 20 2015,positive,great show go see it
May 20 2015,positive,one of the most amazing movies ever wow
May 20 2015,positive,best action yet george miller is a genius
May 20 2015,negative,this movie is so bad it hurts nothing was explained no exposition no back story bash my brains out
May 20 2015,positive,what else can i say that hasnt been said already its one of the best action movies made and one of the best movies ever
May 20 2015,negative,an angry feminist charlize theron avoid if possible
May 20 2015,positive,very interesting film  lots of things to think about  not your average action film
May 20 2015,positive,this film is amazing was so good ive been to watch it again tom hardy is great as max best film ive seen this year 
May 20 2015,positive,this was one of the best movies ive seen in years
May 20 2015,positive,i came a little after watching it
May 20 2015,positive,not just the best action in years but one of the best films ever made from the practical stunts to interesting and creative characters fury road raises the bar for all future action movies
May 20 2015,positive,an excellent action packed movie 75 of the movie is just hardcore action scenes which made this movie stand out from other action movies no wonder lots of people liked this movie going in i thought it was pg13 but then i was like that is tpp violent to be in a pg13 movie but it turned out it was rated r after all not really a fan of the actors who played in this movie but you root for them as they try to escape from the bad guys if you havent seen this go see it it is well worth seeing on the big screen
May 20 2015,positive,mad max is one of the hottestliterally movies you can watch this summer with gut wrenching action sequences and a beautiful world you will want to know more by the end of the movie the great cast and practical effects make up for the sometimes cheesy 3d visuals
May 20 2015,positive,watch this if you like awesome 
May 20 2015,positive,the action is off the wall crazy stylistically it reminds me of the 2008 speed racer movie
May 20 2015,positive,amazing the feminist action film i have been waiting for my entire life 
May 20 2015,negative,terrible 2 hr cartoon  exhausting to watch  dumb story dumb acting dumb dumb dumb   im convinced the critics are somehow afraid to give bad reviews to certain movies
May 20 2015,negative,completely idiotic  crappiest movie seen this year  had some high hopes but they were dashed  laughable scenes due to the stupidness
May 20 2015,positive,absolutely brilliant film non stop action no unnecessary plot lines the best driving  vehicles in cinema history and a refreshingly very creepy and odd film style although im not sure i would like to meet whoever had that in their head only thing not bad or good not really much gore which did surprised me     i think tom hardys entire script could fit on a page of a4 which works very well charlize absolutely killed it like always and this has to to be nicholas hoults best performance to date     i would recommend this film to absolutely everyone even my mum go see it
May 20 2015,positive,old school action done right
May 20 2015,positive,there is almost nothing this movie can be compared to the only thing that disappoints me is the fact that no other directorproducer will have the balls to make a movie like this for fear of opening weekends this movie should not be missed on the big screen want another post apocalyptic film that doesnt hold your hand and doesnt conform to rules of hollywood storytelling watch dredd 2012
May 20 2015,negative,i havent been so bored since man of steel came out maybe if i hadnt at least hoped for a plot it would have been bearable
May 20 2015,positive,it does something ive never seen any other blockbuster do convincingly it puts the female characters in the center spotlight and then talks about a world where men are trying to control women and the women fight back it is about female empowerment while at the same time a damn good pratical effects action spectacle chalize is the main character and she deserves to be steals the spotlight from the titleman
May 20 2015,negative,horrible movie everything in the movie looks fake hollywood should stop doing everything on computers we know its fake a lot of the movie looks like a cartoon lost its authenticity no wonder mel gibson didnt appear in this movie this movie should just be called road fury and not mad max nothing related with the old trilogy disappointment 2 hours of my life down the drain
May 20 2015,negative,110 what a load of old twisted metal garbage that was  2 hours of my life i wont get back
May 20 2015,neutral,im in the minority here but a visually breathtaking movie isnt enough for me to love this
May 20 2015,positive,it was good but overrated
May 20 2015,positive,mad max is a very fun movie to watch its as simple as that there is not a complex script with complex characters but at the same time its not basic there are clear themes in the movie that are relevant to todays society which makes carries this movie but in the end its all about the over the top characters and action its the perfect example of a great summer movie
May 20 2015,positive,total insanity and really not so impressive its a 2 hour theme park ride
May 20 2015,positive,how about a directors cut for even more action pleeeeease
May 20 2015,positive,great action and character that you can really get on board with    really enjoyed the film and when it ended i was left wanting more
May 20 2015,positive,almost better than crack
May 20 2015,positive,loved this movie nonstop action
May 20 2015,positive,bonkers action fantastically creative costumes vehicles and stunts reasonable performances inc a bald nick hoult  good stuff   only downside r rated in us yet 15 here and felt super toned down  why censor for uk market
May 20 2015,positive,i never knew a mad max film could be this good  its everything a blockbuster ought to be but usually isnt
May 20 2015,positive,fast paced with some excellent special effects and amazing camera work
May 20 2015,negative,this is one of the worst movie ever made i cant understand how people can actually love this complete nonsense for one of the first time in my entire life i quit the cinema after an hour and a half i stayed that long thinking that maybe it will become more than just action action action action and complete nonsense
May 20 2015,positive,it was pretty dam good i must say for a mad max movie had all the action you can handle visually it was great looking just a great movie
May 20 2015,negative,no plot just running around shooting in jerky moving camera i walked out
May 20 2015,positive,the best of the mad max series which is saying a lot as it even beats out road warrior this film is a true triumph in every sense of the word its more than just the most entertaining film of the year its expertly made very wellacted and keeps you completely engaged for its entire 2 hour runtime well done mr miller you made another masterpiece
May 20 2015,positive,if theres one film you see this summer make sure its fury road
May 20 2015,positive,i usually cant stand action films at all but for some reason i particularly enjoyed mad max  so much so that i went to see it twice
May 20 2015,positive,i watched this movie whilst eating bacon jalapeão cheesy bread and popcorn and drinking rum and coke with the homies and i dont think i ever stopped saying oh hell yeah pimp leave your family and go see this movie
May 20 2015,positive,as a big fan of  the original i enjoyed the remake  stunts cgi are crazy good
May 20 2015,positive,crazy badass and awesome breathlessly exciting
May 20 2015,positive,pretty amazing film not your typical action movie i highly recommend it
May 20 2015,positive,my favourite movie of the year so far this action packed thrill ride will not leave you disappointed the nonstop action spectacular visuals great story and brilliant characters will leave your spine tingling for more
May 20 2015,negative,this movie added nothing new to the mad max legacy  been there seen that  i should have stayed home and watched thunder dome again
May 20 2015,positive,top notch trill ride with great characters visuals and special affects
May 20 2015,positive,without even seeing its predecessors i can guess this is the best of the 4  once you get past the first 10 odd minutes it kicks into high gear
May 20 2015,positive,urcite sa oplati vidiet v kine  what a lovely day
May 20 2015,positive,we dont need another hero
May 20 2015,positive,a brutally poetic hymn to 1980s blevel scifi films mad max fury road never stops to explain itselfit hits the throttle in the first scene and never lets up in its descent into the bizarre the horrifying and the insane  a nitrodriven film that ironically wallows in excess while depicting the harrowing consequences of such waste and greed fury road is about power survival and the desire for freedom  it is an existential plunge into a literal wasteland where macho posturing allows an oligarchy of sorts to develop and we follow along with those who dare to seek freedom  surprisingly feminist fury road attacks the patriarchy and the class system alike  while its story and politics may lack subtlety this fits perfectly with the history of films to which it pays homage  as each new beautiful nightmarish or just plain badass tableaux unfolds one thing remains certain you will never be able to look away from the screen
May 20 2015,positive,love the movie from beginning to end cant wait to see the sequel
May 20 2015,positive,i loved this movie it was amazing but i should have watched the previous mad maxs
May 20 2015,positive,boom melted face    nuff said
May 20 2015,positive,burning man meets apocalypse
May 20 2015,positive,no unnecessary dialogue needed just awesome
May 20 2015,negative,no story didnt care about the characters no through line endless action i walked out and got my ticket exchanged for another film
May 20 2015,negative,i went to see this movie as a die hard mad max trilogy fan it is way nostalgic for me because my father and i used to watch well it was so one note  and flatter than a pancake    the story line was never developed and for two hours i watched pregnant sister wives run away from their husband captor    it was nothing like the 80s and a sad 4th installment to say the least     the directors attempts at quintin tarantino super fast choppy movements to intensify the action being shown just was weird and creepy
May 20 2015,positive,well if ya want actionand youre all superheroed outhere ya go nonstop awesome throwback action   so much much fun
May 20 2015,positive,actionaction and more action
May 20 2015,positive,pretty awesome compliment to the series
May 20 2015,positive,one of the most thrilling rides ive ever been on  perfect in every way
May 20 2015,positive,over i felt the movie was really good its always going going going it lets up maybe one time but other than that its nonstop continuous action be prepared to sweat and stay on the edge of your seat
May 20 2015,positive,review  mad max fury road    go see this movie thats all i really need to say skip the avengers and go see this movie now it has a 98 rating on rotten tomatoes for a reason ive been looking forward to the new mad max since the first trailer debuted at san diego comic con last year anything that looks this batshit crazy has to be at least fun and i can enthusiastically say that fury road not only lives up to its hype but in many unexpected ways surpasses it    first and foremost this is hands down the best pure action movie in the past ten years at least hell its better than most superhero movies of the past ten years definitely better than any of the avengers films the action stunts set design cinematography and overall pace is a new gold standard for modern action films to follow using nearly all practical effects the movie really sucks you in and makes you buy into every single thing that happens and being r rated the filmmakers really go for it in terms of violence carnage and intensity      the plot is actually pretty bare bones probably the best simple premise since dredd 2012 max is in trouble again he meets a war rig driver named furiosa who is smuggling a group of sex slaves out of the territory and they go on the run in what is essentially a 2 hour car chase with some breaks in between but within the bare bones plot there is a lot of subtle subjective depth and mythos being explored charlize theron as furiosa is an awesome strong female character who is pretty much the main focus of the film and is every bit maxs equal you believe she is a badass nicholas hoult is also great as a crazed cult soldier and expresses much relateability and sympathy and even though max himself has never been a very deepcomplicated character tom hardy is solid in the titular role     and you dont have to have seen the previous mad max films to have a good grasp of what the world and the character is as the movie does an admirable job showing it not telling in a creative easy to follow way but of course seeing the older films can only help as there are many nods to them    i love this movie i love everything about this movie i love the old school car crash action i love the world george miller created i love the frantic pace i love the hard heavy metal music i love the overthetop villains and i love not having to follow a pretentious convoluted plot in a big budget blockbuster i dont think anything else coming out in 2015 is going to top mad max fury road i dont even think star wars can do it
May 20 2015,positive,good high budget action movie that will entertain you but it does little to go against the grain of the well known cliches and thinly veiled social political statements of hollywood movies and it borrowed at least a few elements from birdman you can expect a soundtrack of constantly forced intensity and some plot holes that are very far fetched but leave you feeling good in the end
May 20 2015,positive,a five star film for a five star director   the use of the eyes the look and the closeup to explain the narration is sublime  the aesthetic and the hyperrealism of the photography are really brilliant  cant wait to see mad max wasteland
May 20 2015,negative,cant see where these ratings are coming from  this movie was awful  more like a bad remake of conan the barbarian than mad max  tom hardy doesnt hold a candle to mel gibson in this over hyped mess
May 20 2015,positive,pretty much a perfect ride
May 20 2015,positive,this movie has a basic plot but its a pure adrenaline ride that is filled with awesome action sequences what also makes this movie really good is that majority of the film uses practical effects which just proves you dont need to always use cgi for action sequences but unfortunately most films use a lot of cgi in todays world of entertainment the movie is titled mad max but it feels more about furiosa and max is the supporting character but in a way it works tom hardy charlize theron and nicholas hoult all play their characters very well the soundtrack is epic and the cinematography was really nice this is probably the best action movie i have seen in a while or at least since captain america the winter soldier
May 20 2015,positive,great action the plot was lacking
May 20 2015,positive,the best action movie in the last 5 years
May 20 2015,negative,cant believe how bad this movie is nothing happens for 1 hour story is less than 3 lines not much character development except a little bit for furiosa all the dialogue can be written on 1 side of a paper sheet  max missed his glory time in the one chance they give him to stand alone against all they found a way to get almost nude models showering in white clothing in the middle of the desert and one naked mature woman pretty bad acting overall only furiosa is noticeable no wonder this is her story they should have name the movie after her
May 20 2015,negative,geez this movie was nonstop violenceit gets tiring a boring plot and degrading to women  i wont elaborate on that but it was disgusting dont waste your money on thisits sad to see that it has gotten such high reviews  what a state our society has sunk to
May 20 2015,positive,70yearold george miller returns after 30 years saying move over fast  furious let me show you how its done miller takes his mad max formula and pumps it up to eleven for what is essentially one long car chase while still maintaining a tight narrative wonderful characters and a philosophical battle of the sexes with a feminist bent
May 20 2015,positive,one thing to say is fucking amazing must see
May 20 2015,positive,power make insanity absolute power make insanity absolutely
May 20 2015,positive,more female characters than any marvel movie ever better chase scenes than literally any car based film i felt like i was having a heat attack the whole time and i loved every moment of it
May 20 2015,positive,amazing all out amazing
May 20 2015,positive,this was a good action film i enjoyed it  if you liked the original films then this is just as good
May 20 2015,positive,best action movie in a long long time must see
May 20 2015,positive,saw this a day ago blood is still pumping  an outstanding piece of cinema
May 20 2015,positive,saw it this friday saw it again this tuesday first time seeing a movie twice in the theater this might be your only chance to catch it at the big screen dont miss it
May 20 2015,positive,this film was absolutely amazing if you are a scifi or fantasy fan and even more so a postapocalyptic movie fan you will most likely have a heart attack from pure splendor and joy i will be seeing again in theaters as soon as possible
May 20 2015,positive,this was one action scene after another the storyline is basic and not much acting
May 20 2015,negative,dont want to seem like sour grapes and taste is subjective but my wife  i and 2 sons thought this was dire cartoon like action and little plot and ludicrous at that  certainly there was a lot going on but it all seemed pointless i genuinely would have given 112 stars but dont want to drag the average down as so many people seemed to enjoy it i cant believe the responses normally critics pan actioners while i can find some enjoyment in them but this had nothing to redeem it in my eyes
May 20 2015,negative,mad max with a rottentomato critic rating of 98 and 92 audience thumbs up someone has figured out how to game rt the movie is a piece of crap overproduced polished turd
May 20 2015,positive,throwing any sense of constraint logic or realism out the window fury road is a chaotic relentless explosive ferocious and thoroughly ridiculous thrill ride of ultraviolence and freaky chromeplated postapocalyptic heavy metal weirdness essentially one giant frenzied chase sequence thats built around the barest bones of a plot seasoned director george miller more than compensates with insane spectacle crazy stunts and sheer manic hyperkinetic energy that will leave viewers exhausted exhilerated and totally satisfied this is everything a highbudget mad max sequel should be strap yourself in and prepare to experience the most entertaining action movie in over a decade
May 20 2015,neutral,the movie left me waiting for hard hitting action that kicked off in the last 20 minutes of the movie that never quite took off the scene changes were disruptive and didnt have much flow unless this is the movies style which then wouldnt excuse it for being inconsistent with it all in all its a movie that was held up by great actors not a movie that uplifts its actors
May 20 2015,positive,if you strap yourself in and let yourself just go along for the ride you might just get your mind blown mathew dekinder
May 20 2015,positive,its a bold move to attempt to resurrect a franchise after three decades but its a move that pays off in dividends mad max fury road is one of the best action movies to be made like its predecessors there is minimal dialogue but whatever dialogue there is its simple and hardhitting the action which is mainly composed of car chases is fantastic and packs a punch with its audience what further elevates this movie is the insanity and weirdness that is thrown at us in wonderful bursts what a movie
May 20 2015,positive,through the gorgeously flashy presentation there is little substance to the story the characters and their awfully written exposition only dialogue to the point of this being made at all it is not ahead of its time like the originals it doesnt seem to have anything to do with max instead its about this stale character furiosa performed by charlize theron stale performance from both hardy and theron paired with little story sunk this titanic rock ballad painting of a film then again i am a fan of the true masterpiece that is the road warrior
May 20 2015,positive,not much dialogue but still quite a bit of plot also some great action worth seeing in a big theater
May 20 2015,negative,i guess if u smoke crank u might like this
May 20 2015,positive,mad max fury road was really good the action was amazingcharlize theron was brilliant and i definitely enjoyed tom hardy as mad max i also enjoyed nicholas hoults character quite a bit too  i would absolutely see this movie again
May 20 2015,negative,bored me to sleep action seemed sped up like you would be fast forwarding on a vcr
May 20 2015,positive,this movie was by far the most fun i had in a long time  way better  more realistic action scenes than the last couple of ff movies  a must watch for all adrenaline junkies  i hope they keep this franchise going for a long time  the possibilities are endless
May 20 2015,positive,got ur monies worth in crazy action   but dont ask for more  like to see directors cut  lol  must be a car nuts dream to work on this set
May 20 2015,positive,excellent action sequence best acting by tom hardy  charlize theron not to be miss for action movie fans 
May 20 2015,positive,it was a hell of a crazy movie it portrays insanity to the power of n where n  infinity irresistibly entertaining not for everybody though you have to find your inner demons to like this movie
May 20 2015,positive,probably the best action film ever made weird wild and wonderful
May 20 2015,positive,the best action film since the dark knight fury road unexpectedly became a smart film delivered in an awesome narrative and has some damn good explosions too take that michael bay
May 20 2015,negative,to be short they turned the newest installation of mad max into a feminist anthem mad maxs character is merely on for the ride in what becomes what one reviewer called a feminist declaration of independence you see according to the ideology of the movie women once lived in the green place until men ruined everything  man ruins everything and woman is a helpless victim woman is generous and when given the chance will save the masses unlike man who will only abuse his power there are places for overdone feminist anthems mad max was not one of those places i could whine about plot holes and shallow two dimensional characters but the movie was so over the top ridiculous that it would be pointless
May 20 2015,negative,chick flick disguised as action adventure  women for women surrounded by bad men
May 20 2015,positive,relentless entertainment with awesome performances from hardy and theron
May 20 2015,positive,if you want action this movie is 995 action id venture to say tom hardy is better than mel gibson but the movie has a different feel than the originals and the time since helps to add the difference the special effects are spectacular especially the dust storm
May 20 2015,positive,best movie ever action packed 
May 20 2015,positive,never watched the old mad max i was going knowing nothing about this movie it was good but didnt really took me in good action movie tought
May 20 2015,positive,wow this movie is awesome tom hardy is the best
May 20 2015,positive,i was really excited for this and it not disappoint this movie is just exciting intense nonstop and just crazy the stunts are spectacular all the apocalyptic makeup and designs are interesting theron and hardy are excellent in this as well

May 20 2015,positive,unbelievable the best action movie ive ever seen
May 20 2015,negative,poor acting poor storyline saved only by the special effects mad max 12 and 3 was far better   hardy did seem to know how to act almost dumb like poor showing disappointing
May 20 2015,positive,as a fan of the original i was excited for this reboot this movie was so overthetop that it was amazing
May 20 2015,positive,2hr awesome cat chase
May 20 2015,positive,great action and breath taking stuns from start to finish  dialog and story almost nonexistant  still worth watching for the action
May 20 2015,positive,holy crap words cannot describe the awesomeness of this film you can tell that the original director came back as fury road has all the feel of the original mad max and tom hardy sounds almost exactly like mel gibson all around every actor is on their game from the pulse pounding edge of your seat action to the incredibly serial and important dialogue that is only uttered sparingly best movie of the summer so far and one of the best action movies ive seen in decades
May 20 2015,positive,george millers longawaited sequel  30 years after thunderdome max is back with a vengeance
May 20 2015,positive,visceral visually stunning and hugely entertaining
May 20 2015,positive,i dont know if youve heard but this new mad max movie is pretty good
May 20 2015,positive,apocalypse is also an analog goes
May 20 2015,positive,wooowowowowowooooooooooo  98   really  relax people  keep your shirts on    narrative heft  come on    this is not citizen kane  or papillon  or leon  or apocalypse now  or total recall    you people are most deffinetly jaded  i wonder how many people who gave this a 5 stardrop everything rating would enjoy waterworld if it came out today and with no changes made    a lot    in a time of masses of unbelievably bad rotten brainless hollywood drivel slobbering all over the place and of course over the one popular genre people use to unwind in particular  anything with even the mildest hint of originality seems to receive considerable praise    if you have seen the other madmax movies you will see nothing new here  really  not at all  it is very true to his form and thus formulaic  it is basicaly a remake of madmax 2    and in true 80s fashion it starts of strong and looses a lot of steam along the way    nevertheless the way that miller fleshes out aspects of behaviour and the archaic system of belief in a postapocalyptic society including speech and values builds a very enjoyable and strong foundation for an exciting movie ride  and this was only possible with a considerably larger budget than 4 million dollars  still with the limited entourage and all of the desert shots it really makes you wonder how little you can get for 150 million these days 2015    but   the rest of the movie does not care much to build or expand upon it at all opportunities immensly missed     a lot of things he might be trying to say become to me very nonsensical andmushy   this is pulp ficiton   really    tom hardy yes     charlize theron nooooooooo    as imperator furiosa i really believe miller could have made a better choice for a female road warrior    i kept asking myself what is she composed unhinged ruthless lonely insecure dedicated and so on and so forth  whatever it is i do not think you can tell by looking at her face   her face never tells a story she just is  she just looks  great   yeah ok i get that but i knew it before    just no good  better than tina turner thoughjust in case you dont get itsigh    to me it is a failed acting attempt    with either very little to go on or no or too little imagination on her part    in respect to his portrayal of women to me miller is still a very 2 dimensional and 1980s kind of guy       i mean there is a lot of imagined speech right it wasnt just bad sound design that i could not understand 80 of the dialogue
May 20 2015,positive,very entertaining even though its not my genre
May 20 2015,positive,drop everything and go see it right now
May 19 2015,negative,i read the reviews on rt for max max fury road  after hearing that it was directed by the original director of the 80s mad max movies which i had seen back then and thought were ok the 98 positive reviews had me a little concerned  because the last time i saw a movie based on high rt reviews it follows i was very disappointed because the movie was very bad i decided to take a chance and saw mad max fury road in an rpx theater enhanced screen and sound i wouldnt say mad max was as bad as it follows but it wasnt good either the rpx theater by the way just seems to have louder but worse sound than normal theaters was not worth the extra 10 and the movie was not worth any of the money    my main problem with the movie is that there is zero character development there is nothing at all die hard by comparison is a movie of incredibly extensive and exhaustive character development i did not care about any of these people a grain of sand has more presence than tom hardys max character the women next to him had only a little more at least there was a lot of sand this movie also sets new heights for unrealistic action scenes someone forgot to tell the director that humans are made of flesh and bone and that there is this thing called physics the action scenes grow increasingly tedious with just a lot of things happening fast you end up wishing it could just all happen already and be done as for a movie plot its just action scenes based around a bunch of women looking for a green grocer or something dumb like that which turns out to just be where they escaped from the guitar guy that some reviews mention is silly you cant even make out what he is playing most of the time its not metal its just noisy     really the whole movie is a big hype job with nothing special about it just a lot of action scenes strung together  with mostly ugly people and ugly limbless women running around doing dumb and very unrealistic things i was very happy when the movie ended and from now on when i see a movie with a high rt rating percentage i am going to consider that a tip off to avoid the movie at all costs
May 19 2015,positive,this movie completely  lived up to my hype which most of the movie cant do these days
May 19 2015,positive,absolutely amazing george miller brings his vision back to screen in a big way we need more movies like this george miller    lsd  max
May 19 2015,positive,the most incredible action movie i have seen this year accompanied my music that i still cant get out of my head
May 19 2015,positive,you have to watch mad max in a theater preferably in an imax or 3d  this movie sets the bar for what gritty blockbuster movies should be like and that is saying something in this superhero generation  the action supported by a heart thumping soundtrack and uncanny characters is so splendid that the quieter moments come as a respite so you can finally exhale and exclaim woah   this is action blockbuster at its best its big its loud and its loaded go see it now
May 19 2015,positive,very repetitive great onetime watch
May 19 2015,positive,stupid awesome not the deepest film but i loved watching it
May 19 2015,positive,george millers fury road is a hundred things at once a biker movie a spaghetti western a postapocalyptic dystopian action pic a tale of female empowerment the vagina monologues eve ensler was a consultant on set a bosch painting made scary 3d real a keystone kops screwball romp and an auto show from hell   vec 5 minuta varin na ovaj ensler dio   i ne gledat ga u 3d
May 19 2015,positive,it pays to be unmedicated  like rob zombie and silent hill had a baby in the desert can honestly say 300 now has a rival for most badass manmovie if i had to use one word to describe it id say this movie was metal props to the disturbed minds behind this masterpiece
May 19 2015,positive,fantastic movie lived up to its hype road warrior times ten cant wait to see it again
May 19 2015,positive,the most insane awesome movie ive ever seen in my life
May 19 2015,positive,utterly amazing from the very start to the end must see
May 19 2015,positive,better than the avengers
May 19 2015,positive,what a lovely day indeed from the opening scene to the very last you will not be disappointed  what an amazingly filmed movie  great shots amazing action tons of fun  i cant wait for the next 3 mad max movies that hardy has already signed on for  gonna be a lovely series indeed
May 19 2015,positive,fun fun fun freaks wonderful cars great make up art direction and visuals and no story whatsoever
May 19 2015,positive,so to preface i have never seen a mad max movie and everyone was telling me that i have to watch this i would love it so on and so forth and ill be honest in the first 15 minutes i had no clue what i had gotten myself into it was a little overwhelming the types of movies that just throw you into a world with no explanation always throw me for a minute but what i will say is that once im in i am sucked in 100 and this i was sucked in 1000 what is this society why is almost everyone from it sick how did furiosa become the only woman in power why is there a flame throwing guitar now these are all questions that are still swirling around my brain but in the moment i could have cared less i was simply along for the ride the visuals are absolutely stunning that sandstorm at the beginning holy hell the acting from the main characters is on point charlize theron is my queen the chase scene in the last half hour had me incredibly stressed out in the best way possible the storyline was deeper than a typical action movie i could honestly keep going i would love to watch this again now that i understand everything and just dive in and go along for the ride
May 19 2015,positive,im extremely picky about movies often my friends say im too picky but this is the most exhilarating experience ive had in the theaters since titanic
May 19 2015,positive,as perfect and close to masterpiece status that a big dumb action movie can possibly get this is the movie that michael bay would make if michael bay were somebody other than michael bay    the nonstop action was obviously awesome but thats not the only thing this film does incredibly well there was so much originality and inventiveness in nearly every visual aspect of the film the sets the set pieces the cars props character design wardrobe and cinematography all work together to create a world that feels fresh and alive    now the story isnt anything special and theres some hokey acting in some parts but none of that matters this is an incredible impressively crafted action movie that needs to seen by fans of this genre
May 19 2015,negative,this movie wasnt my cup of tea its both visually stunning and grotesque
May 19 2015,positive,non stop action awesome
May 19 2015,positive,absolutely insane movie  seriously it is so crazy every shot is unique and their ideas for vehicles and action sequences are way weird but awesome
May 19 2015,positive,masterpiece in terms of visuals and designs barely developed and an endless cliche in regards to the narrative
May 19 2015,positive,everything cray cray  but epic
May 19 2015,positive,the movie was so good i just wanted more and more i thought i would miss mel and even though i did tom did a great job as max i cant wait til the sequel
May 19 2015,positive,absolutely incredible action filmnon stop insanity at its finest
May 19 2015,positive,best action movie of the recent times  
May 19 2015,positive,some of the best action set pieces ive ever seen on film this movie is so intense they should have seat belts in the theatres playing this you can tell that this is a very distinct vision from a director and not a film made by focus groups and studio heads a different movie making style than your average action movie the story is pretty barebones and the production design is pretty steampunkstrange and might turn some average viewers off but what a thrill not a casual movie to watch you better hold on to your hats and glasses because this joyride is a brutal one
May 19 2015,positive,excellent movie an postapocalypctic film where every single second of it makes you stay at the edge of your sit with many thrills and action scenes
May 19 2015,positive,must watch movie adrenaline non stop action  the best movies of the year so far  i hope we see tons more george millers new work
May 19 2015,positive,i havent seen a movie this well written and visually beautiful in a long time
May 19 2015,positive,nice movie it reflect the pollution problems on earth and nice stun scene
May 19 2015,positive,best action movie so far this year must see story line is tight while unpredictable love the plot heroic but not out of reality the world the characters live in is also interesting not boring for even a minute
May 19 2015,positive,relentless brutal nonstop chaos violence and carnage fueled by insanity and speedwhat more could you ask for a brilliant new addition to the franchise
May 19 2015,positive,insane in the membrane
May 19 2015,negative,absolutely terrible
May 19 2015,positive,these strong female roles have definitely caused quite a stir in the patriarchy thats what i call my penis
May 19 2015,negative,98 percent critic and 92 percent audience how  did i watch the same movie  the movie i watched was so bad i wanted to leave ten minutes into itonly stayed because my nephew was somehow brainwashed that if rotten tomatoes said it was goodit isdespite the unfolding evidence in front of usthis high rating also causes me to wonder if rotten tomatoes gets paid by someone to manufacture fictitious resultsi have seen post apocalyptic b movies with way more plot and substance then this mess remember how bad kevin costners waterworld wasthink of this as a version of that movieonly with sand everywhere instead of water no real plota gasoline rig plowing through the desert with the intent of reaching the green place with no explanation whythen making a u turn after picking up a handful of old women bikers who will save the day with mad max against several hundred bad guysall at 70mphi could go into an extensive breakdown of everything wrong with this moviebut i think ive wasted enough of my life sitting through almost two hours of wtf
May 19 2015,positive,this movie will leave you thinking about it for days if not weeks
May 19 2015,positive,a magnificent mesmerizing coup
May 19 2015,positive,great action film brilliant stunt work tom hardy is a bad ass charlize theron is a beast leaves you wanting more

May 19 2015,positive,see full review at checkmarkedfilmreviewscom
May 19 2015,positive,incredibly mad max fury road manages to deliver a dieselmouthed dose of adrenaline that isnt hindered by the emotional core underneath its muscle
May 19 2015,positive,power hungry deformed monstrosities leading bands of insane religious lunatics across desert wastelands for dominance cant get more mad max then this should have got hugh jackman to play max though
May 19 2015,negative,i am just boggled by the reviews on this honestly i saw this with my husband and neither of us liked this at all theres basically little to no character development in it at all so i didnt give a crap about what was happening to anyone throughout the whole thing half the time i couldnt even understand what anyone was saying anyway so theres that i dunno other than the visuals nothing was compelling about this at all we wanted to walk out halfway but waited a while longer to no good end the 1 and 12 stars im giving this is for the guy with the flaming guitar or the gwar truck as my husband calls it nothing else in this movie was worth the time or the money paid to see it
May 19 2015,positive,took my 14yr old son to see this last night my expectations were low  this movie was so unbelievably entertaining only charlize theron could be onearmed and buzzcut while still looking gorgeous  tom hardy is great even if hes grunting rather than talking  difficult to understand at times bc of the sheer volume of everything going on but if you love the grand scape of an epic movie this is it i should add i would not take my 10year old son to see this movie the freaks would have scared the hell out of him
May 19 2015,positive,mad max fury road is an awesome action movie along with having a strong female lead who kicks tons of ass i had a great time watching this movie
May 19 2015,negative,this was the first mad max movie ive seen i now know why it was rubbish a 12 year old computer savvy school boy could have made a the film  i did notice a few minutes of acting by charlize theron and tom hardy but that was it   nicholas hoult did a good job as nux but then hes an english actor  charlize theron is too good an actress to play these computer generated movies
May 19 2015,positive,believe the hype this completely bonkers romp of ultraviolent motor vehicle mayhem and fascinating and at times hilarious sexual politics with a healthy helping of feminist glory restores order in a long weathered history of epic summer blockbusters the relentless adrenaline will melt your face off
May 19 2015,positive,to long   great action movie
May 19 2015,positive,worth the wait best flick of the year so far
May 19 2015,positive,insane action from start to stop this movie really kept the pace up
May 19 2015,positive,what a lovely day  theres never a dull moment well almost never   tom hardy really played his part having to deal with the memories of the people mel gibson let die i thoroughly enjoyed it but i fell like furiosa got a lot more  action maybe thats why its called fury road   with that being said i didnt enjoy it as much as everyone else did but i really liked it very much
May 19 2015,positive,good but i still like the original better better plot and mel gibson was the man
May 19 2015,positive,charlize theron you sexy beast ily

May 19 2015,positive,cool effects story soso
May 19 2015,positive,look either you want to watch a postapocalyptic adrenalinefest where skullfaced kamikaze drivers riding in spiked and heavily weaponized vehicles bang drums and play a flamethrowing electric guitar while chasing down a bunch of escaped women being helped by a man driven mad by those whom he failed to help in the past and accompanied by numerous gloriously insane action sequences and huge explosions or you wont if youre one of those in the later category well i dont even know why youre reading what im typing right now this was completely nonsensical totally insane and i loved it
May 19 2015,positive,just not my kind of movie
May 19 2015,positive,as mad maxian as any of the prior 3 with mel gibson quite the accomplishment
May 19 2015,negative,an enjoyable romp but nothing like the grittiness of the road warrior the plot is a flimsy excuse to have an extravagant car chase none of the desperate drive like the true gem of the series    it almost matches the first in the series mad max but for all its budget and glitz it cant quite match the stark future more realistically portrayed in that first movie    2  25 stars depending on whether or not if you value glitz more than story
May 19 2015,positive,weird but the movie was so cold the fight scenes are brutal
May 19 2015,positive,great action adventure flix high octane and mind blown
May 19 2015,positive,a beyond worthy reboot of a great series mad max fury road delivers with great action scenes dazzling special effects great acting and great thrills tom hardy is  great replacement for mel gibson i really hope that this movie breaks the trend of action movies not being nominated for major academy awards
May 19 2015,positive,how best to describe the brutal unflinching cinematic brilliance that director george miller throws at us in mad max fury road its volcanic electrifying hell on wheels its been nearly 30 years since miller now 70 left his mad max trilogy that starred mel gibson as max rockatansky a road warrior on a mission of vengeance for his murdered family in a dystopian wasteland ruled by biker gangs and warlords since then millera former er doctor turned filmmakerhos gone on to direct such familyfriendly features as babe pig in the city and two happy feet movies    goddamn how good it is to have him back among the dark and twisted the longintheworks fury road is an rrated unrelenting romper stomper a 150 million chase epic that soars on millers indisputable visionary genius theres no happy feet schmaltz here    is this trip down fury road always coherent and credible not a chance but so what you just sit back and hold on for dear life brit actor tom hardy steps into the iconic role for gibson as max and he does the role proud his first words begin in voiceover my name is max my world is fire and blood got that right plagued by visions of his lost child max is taken captive by immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne who also played toecutter in 1979s mad max a terrifying warlord who controls his people by controlling their water supply joes elite soldiers the inbred bald war boys smear their bodies in white paint gulp down breast milk to mitigate radiation effects and live off the promise of a fantastical afterlife full of erotic pleasures i live i die i live again    the plot hits the gas when joes trusted ally furiosa charlize theron a warrior with a mechanical left arm goes rogue and takes off in an armored oil rig with joes five breeder wivesplayed by rosie huntingtonwhiteley zoe kravitz abbey lee courtney eaton and riley keough joe and his entire army are in hot pursuit including nux a wonderful nicholas hoult who has max tied in front of his speeding car as he taps maxs arm for blood    theres no room for exposition in the plotcooked up by miller and cowriters brendan mccarthy and nico lathouristhat is essentially one big vroom the fact that the characters come through so vividly and distinctly is a tribute to the actors first hardy is muzzled with a mask similar to what he wore as bane in the dark knight rises i bet you want that damn thing off your face furiosa tells him as she sees him whole she and max form a bond that is all show not telling dialog is minimal especially when it comes to max hardy and theron are an amazing team but the film really belongs to theron shes dynamite in a sensational performance that blends hardwon grit and gravity shes the bruised heart and soul of this fury road the feminist overtones may get some fanboys blood boiling so what its that audaciousness to not reduce female characters to playthings that lifts this action gem above the herd    as furiosa seeks redemption for her sins miller keeps the eyepopping images coming whether its a vicious sandstorm or the arresting sight of a guitar player whose instrument shoots flames as others literally beat the war drums miller keeps the green screen and cgi at a minimum as well and the stunt work defines stateoftheart as bodies and vehicles bash one another amidst a real life landscape the film was shot in africas namib desert by the amazing john seale the perfect storm the english patient 72 who was coaxed out of retirement by miller    in short mad max fury road is a rare occasion featuring awardcaliber work from editor margaret sixel millers wife to the dazzling costumes by jenny bevin and the thunderous score from dutch composer junkie xl mad max fury road kicks all the ass all of it  it will knock you sideways

May 19 2015,negative,worst movie i have ever seen i came close to walking out
May 19 2015,positive,wow good movie non stop action
May 19 2015,positive,this is the film we will compare future rebootssequels to    the only drawback i could think of is with all of the deliciously exquisite detailsnuances that the writerdirector included in the town of citadel and throughout the film it wouldve been even better if perhaps another 15 mins or so couldve been interjected into the middle of the film in another town to break up the fury road car chases      but even still this film rocked in a post apocolyptic steam punk way that im sure will spawn a lot of wannabes the way the matrix did
May 19 2015,positive,miller does a pretty good job throughout the film of making the heroes seem in danger and trying to make the attacks against them seem new or fresh even though that really is the same thing that is happening to them over the course of the whole film it really is odd that these kamikaze warriors with nothing to live for arenât a bit more successful when they are willing to sacrifice themselves to derail or destroy these rebellious heroes    for full review and other reviews go to moviescoundrelcom
May 19 2015,positive,fast paced energetic and awesome great performances from the leads and supporting cast alike a highly intelligent and entertaining action film
May 19 2015,positive,awesome captivating movie from the beginning to the end is filled with adrenalinepacked moments and scenes overall this was a great film anyone can enjoy
May 19 2015,neutral,a disappointment fury road is not as good as the other instalments  mad max fury road was one long road pursuit  a tiresome visual display of c g i  i miss the old gone in 60 second real life car stunts  the  bad guy characters are to cartoonish which gave fury road no real villain  what saves fury road is the max character tom hardy hits the mark perfectly as the silent and tormented max we all know no matter how hardened max has become there still is a heart of gold in the man   without hardy fury road would come out flat  two and half stars  watchable but pales to the road warrior
May 19 2015,positive,visually great and exciting but far from a great movie maybe 5 pages of dialogue for the whole movie and barely a framework of a story
May 19 2015,negative,good action strong female leads interesting postapocalyptic cultures funif stupidmachinesnot much else  ok the action shots were mostly done live and great  but post apocalyptic deathcult members playing the role of zombies  meh     the antagonist a sort of l ron hubbard type with a great breathing mask and a cute harem was good  the madmax vehicles were over the top  however there is not much plot      when the scantily clad babes of the harem appear dressed literally in a single artful layer of gauze they are so not a part of  this reality its totally jarring  jarring enough to throw you out of the suspension of disbelief  these womanchildren are perfectly pampered shaved trimmed oiled and and madeup like victorias secret models on a shoot everyone else is dressed for the outback plus some war paint     mothers milk is a plot item not fully articulated  water is hoarded and wasted  vehicle fuel is both not available and wasted by the military types  rocknroll amplification is both hidden and outfront  electric lighting is mia so the victorias secret models light a candle inside a moving vehicle    hero worship by the deathcult kids is well done  a culture of women warriors is a nice touch but very badly realized  2 of 5 stars is being nice
May 19 2015,positive,its everything you want to see in a mad max movie  tons of fun and nonstop action
May 19 2015,positive,one big crazy chase scene  lots of action
May 19 2015,positive,probably one of the best action movies ive seen in years definitely worth a watch
May 19 2015,positive,i thought this movie was very visual entertaining and was well made ending was fun it was just a big joy ride it had moments of slow parts but in the end its very well done made i thought this movie was entertaining and fun to watch
May 19 2015,positive,full five stars to this movie just what i wanted no real story blow em up action hot girls charlize theron and of course that guitar playing awesomeness
May 19 2015,positive,my heart is still pounding from this crazy adrenaline rush do not wait to watch it on dvd its a visual fest worth the ticket money poor character development barely a story  are you kidding us critics its all there for you to see not be told as far as action movies go one of the best period
May 19 2015,positive,mad max fury road is the type of action move we should have been having for 20 years outstanding direction visuals and acting a must see
May 19 2015,negative,i think all the critics must have been paid off or something because this movie was really not very good  i liked it for about the first 10 minutes and after that i was pretty much bored and couldnt wait for it to be over  the movie has no story at all  pretty much a guy escapes bad place then its a car chase for the first half of the movie and then they turn around and its a car chase for the 2nd half winding up right back at the bad place where they started  the second half also is also even more boring than the first half  people have remarked about how good charlize theron is in this  but most of her acting involves her sitting in a car driving   id hardly call it the most challenging performance of the year ive also heard about how great the action is  i like action films too but this was just not the best example of the genre  just your garden variety fast cuts where you can barely tell what is going on  no logical flow and not even particularly very good action editing  there are some interesting visuals but you pretty much see it all in the trailer so whats left for my 20 admission   honestly i felt ripped off
May 19 2015,positive,never seen movie like thisa definition of action movie
May 19 2015,positive,mad and ferocious lets give credit where its due george miller and charlize theron for starters
May 19 2015,positive,basic mad max fury road a part sequel and a part reboot to the mad max trilogy the story in this film starts off where max played by tom hardy is being pursued by a group of warboys and very quickly enough he gets captured we see max getting so many hallucinations we see that the warboys are taken over his clothes his stuff and now his blood    then we get another hero in the film and shes a female action hero named imperator furiosa played by charlize theron who has taken immortan joes played by hugh keaysbyrne five wives toast played by zoe kravitz the splendid angharad played by rosie huntingtonwhiteley capable played by riley keough the dag played abbey lee and cheedo the fragile played by courtney eaton joe and his army are now going after her and retrieve back the five wives then later in the film max is team up with furiosa and the five wives to get far away from immortan joe and searching for a new home that has food and water    whats the deal mad max fury road what is there that i want to say about the film i would say pretty much everything about it i remember when i saw the comiccon trailer of mad max fury road i actually thought that looks cool and i had this feeling like it might be a fun actionpacked movie but when the other trailers to mad max fury road came out this is where i started to feel a little bit down and getting some mixed feelings about it not only because theyre not as exhilarating as the comiccon trailer to mad max fury road but its also because i started to feel like the film might be mixed on how the storytelling may somehow be empty suddenly when the film was about to come out in theaters or already came out in theaters this is where im hearing so many great reviews about the film and it literally made me going to the point of where i wanted to see this movie it actually took me a while for me to see this movie because there were some other movies that i was checking out then i remember watching mad max fury road on the day that was right before jurassic world was about to come out in theaters from the opening moment of where we see some of the credits rolling then we see max being chase by the warboys and being capture by them this is where i literally going to the edge of my seat not only to the opening scene of the film but the entire movie from start to finish yes     what happened was we been seeing that almost the entire film is set out in the desert and then we been getting tons of action and chase sequences we see people are getting shot at with bullets and arrows cars are getting destroyed by big trucks warboys are throwing sticks to peoples cars that can actually explode then we also see this one character whose call himself the doof warrior and hes on top of a big truck playing his flame throwing guitar while the truck is driving thats actually one of the most craziest and memorable moments ive ever seen from a film somehow i just really like the way how this movie cranks itself up every single one of these action scenes is absolutely exhilarating and there is just so much in it its like the director george miller was thinking this through by not only the plot but also the action sequences he was trying not to make it too long but he was trying not to make it too short either all he was trying to do was keeping everything in balance its like he thinks to himself on how that works and how that doesnt the action sequences goes on to one thing after another and while the action is rolling along and keeping everything fastpaced we also see that the characters dont at all come across being stiffed and the film switches to one character to another to see whats going on to them or whats happening to them thats what so great about it because you can totally feel the exhilaration coming right at you when those things are presented in the film the scenery looks beautiful and the visuals are overthetop in such an exciting way i also notice that the film does run about 2 hours long and there are some moments in the film that does come off slow but believe me i was never at all bored with anything in this movie    the one performance in this movie that really acts like a real star in there and its not tom hardyi would admit that tom hardy is actually quite good ive always like him since the first time i saw in a movie which that was inception in here he does seem to be good when hes in his game but the one performance which does so many things in there is charlize theron  i do see that shes been getting a few razzie nominations all because of that movie she was in last year a million ways to die in the west but in here i really enjoyed watching her when shes playing this female action hero furiosa i really like her performance as much as i really like sigourney weaver in aliens her outfit or the style of her character looks amazing shes brave shes fearless and she does a lot of driving a lot of shooting and other things that makes her a reason of why shes like a real star to this nicholas hoult on the other hand steals the shows when hes playing the character nux and i also have this big connection to his character in fact i really do have a connection with all these characters in the film even if i dont know much about them as for the rest of the supporting cast they all did a fine job     my full opinion for all of its exhilarating action and everything that the film delivers mad max fury road is an amazing and yet an insane ride 9610
May 19 2015,positive,so much action a little too much really could have used more dialogue and bits of humour but the rad cars intensely violent sequences and crazy characters make this the popcorn movie of the summer   watched at eau claire with derek clay dale and susan may 18 2015
May 19 2015,positive,one chase scene too long otherwise very good interesting and enjoyable
May 19 2015,positive,warning watch at your own risk this movie may cause heart attack stroke hearing loss parkinsons and if watched in 3d may result in death one of the best movies ever made you will watch it 100000 times and not get board
May 19 2015,positive,the action and special effects were amazing  not much dialog none needed  it was lots of fun after watching mel about 21 years ago
May 19 2015,positive,great action great film just not enough max for a mad max film personally
May 19 2015,positive,i dont see how this movie can be improved
May 19 2015,positive,mad and ferocious lets give credit where its due george miller and charlize theron for starters
May 19 2015,positive,awesome totally awesome
May 19 2015,positive,oh what a lovely movie
May 19 2015,positive,a lot of the chaos at the beginning was a bit fatiguing and threatened to put me to sleep i know that sounds counterintuitive but its true somewhere along the line the movie captured my attention and i was along for the ride id read some rumblings about a feminist agenda poisoning the movie and found that not to be the case at all at least not the socialcontrol manhating nonsense that often parades itself as feminism nowadays was surprised to see brendan mccarthys name in the story credits and thought it must be a different dude til his design credit soon followed im gonna guess he came up with some of those odd character names im a long time fan of his comicbook work and his animated series reboot
May 19 2015,positive,suspend disbelief strap in and simply enjoy the ride  what a rush
May 19 2015,positive,mad max fury road is relentless nonstop action from start to finish and yet has a deeper message than most films today this is what summer a blockbuster should look like
May 19 2015,positive,miller has set a new chaotic standard in the film industry
May 19 2015,positive,ive been waiting for this movie for so long
May 19 2015,positive,fantastic movie if youre a fan of the originals its a mustsee
May 19 2015,positive,what a perfect movie   insane action with perfect visual
May 19 2015,positive,unashamedly brash loud and brutal
May 19 2015,positive,in an unexpected way this movie actually has a feminist bent  i think that redeems some other aspects that are gratuitous explosions or slender plot  more entertaining than i expected  women are the real heroes and the hope for the future  why not
May 19 2015,positive,i cant even remember the last time ive watched the mad max series starring mel gibson this was a very long ago 30 years later a forth film gets released in cinemas written directed and produced by george miller this is the fourth film in the mad max franchise mad max fury road does feel like a reboot in totally different way but its not with mel gibson being too old in playing the role he is now replaced by tom hardy    does george miller keep the series fresh after 30 years the answer is yes making it feel like an r rated movie with tons of car chases and explosions fury road is nothing but a work of art set in a postapocalyptic wasteland story starts of being haunted by his turbulent past mad max believes the best way to survive is to wander alone nevertheless he becomes swept up with a group fleeing across the wasteland in a war rig driven by an elite imperator furiosa charlize theron they are escaping a citadel tyrannized by the immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne from whom something irreplaceable has been taken enraged the warlord marshals all his gangs and pursues the rebels ruthlessly in the highoctane road war that follows    for a two hour film it really does try and impressive you on how much everything can be done in one film based on survival action and an eruption of craziness which just makes this perfect for a film if youve played games like fallout and borderlands you will really be in for a treat on what surprises can be found in fury road but if youve not played both games fury road does give you an idea on how you should prepared if a postapocalyptic would happen later in the future i would be very surprised if they make another mad max film after this one being so successful worldwide because we know that george miller knows how to make a good action movie when we see one and the fact that fury road makes us want more movies like these if you havent seen this movie yet i would highly recommend you seeing this movie
May 19 2015,negative,i just cant believe that in the wide world of critics this loud raucous and largely plotless film got 98 where are the critics who after the first hour or so of loud engines and bloodlust arent gonna say hey wait a minute what is this all for the first of this franchise that saw was the road warrior and while it had its own share of blood n roar did have a relatively interesting storyline as well as the comic relief from the gyro pilot and the feral kid  this was just one grim deafening scene after another with some very poorly thought out twists such as spoiler alert the otherwise savvy furiosa not having even the smarts of the notsogenius max in being able to figure out that driving for 160 days with what fuel across a salt pan was not exactly a great plan hey and given that even at a very low daily mileage of saw a couple of 100 that would have taken them 32000 miles anybody ever heard of seas or that the earth has a circumference at its thickest point is less than that duh seems to be a good one word summary for this noisy nonsense film
May 19 2015,negative,i did not like this movie  i felt like i was enduring it rather than enjoying it  i would rather see charlize theron dressed to the nines and looking good not wearing a prosthetic arm and waving around a stump  you can tell that a lot of this was geared around the 3d version  okay it had some good stuff  like the guitar playerliving hood ornament who shot fire out of his instrument  i thought most of it was over the top  very violent gritty etc  and if this is what the post apocalyptic future would be please dont let me survive the first wave of the attack
May 19 2015,positive,best beginning of a movie ever left   me thinking that there would be no way to keep this pace and then it does a movie i will definitely be seeing again in the theater because there is so much talent and details in every scene
May 19 2015,positive,probably the best action movie ive seen this year
May 19 2015,positive,the film george miller has always wanted to make done to a standard only he can achieve
May 19 2015,positive,off the wall great action visually insane
May 19 2015,positive,not enough starts to rate this movie what a mad crazy amazing journey nothing will beat this for yearsloved it wow
May 19 2015,positive,mad max fury road is another movie in the mad max series it is not a reboot it is a continuation of mad max stories this one takes place between the road warrior and beyond the thunderdome first off this movie is beautiful every single shot looks fantastic it looks like a painting the visuals in this are also so beautiful almost the whole movie is practical effects and you can see in the action scenes that this real like the old ones there isnt much dialogue just pure action the acting is great tom hardy plays a great max of course mel gibson well always be the best max but tom does a great of carrying that character the one character who steals every scene is charlize therons character imperator furiosa every scene shes in shes just kills it the action is unbelievable george miller knows how to shoot old school action and he does not disappoint even we theres 50 cars on the screen you can see perfectly whats happen this movie is worth paying the ticket for imax 3d this makes george miller a mastermind and the whole movie a masterpiece overall mad max fury road was a crazy fun nonstop action movie with great character development defiantly a movie that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible if your a fan of mad max or just a fan of action movies you need to see this
May 19 2015,neutral,i guess i must be getting old because it sure seems as though im in the minority over this movie i hardly ever go to movies anymore unless i know its top notch friends and the reviews all said it was an awesome movie so i checked it out    the special effects action and sound were really good but the plot was basically just a car chase for 2 hours nonstop it was okay for the first half of the movie but then when they just did it again i was pretty over it there was hardly any acting outside of the chases i guess the new generations now want nonstop action in their action movies instead of plot development just like in the new avengers movie id take the original mad max movies any day over this one
May 19 2015,positive,in 1999 matrix blew me away with metaphysics  special effects in 2015 i was just as blown away by madmaxfuryroad being deeply feminist
May 19 2015,positive,to similar to road warrior no back story for younger audiences
May 19 2015,positive,beautiful work by george miller the story itself fits in beautifully with the over 2 hours of intense action scenes coreogrophy is probably one of the best ive seen in a while and two thumbs up for charlize therons performance as the ba furiosa accompanied by the no fuss and man of few words tom max hardy it is on hell of a fun movie to watch
May 19 2015,positive,this is not only the best action film of the year let alone one of the best films of 2015 not only the best action film in ten years but one of the best action films of all time george miller shows everyone how its done and puts all modern action movies to shame
May 19 2015,positive,awesome movie lots of action
May 19 2015,positive,one of the most important pieces of modern cinema ever devised you dont have to like it or understand it but you owe it your attention
May 19 2015,positive,best movie of the year for sure
May 19 2015,positive,there hasnt been a movie like this made since the 80s90s it is surprisingly good and its not a reboot nonstop action movie with great cars and stunts
May 19 2015,positive,i seen it twice and its the best movie i seen in a long time great acting great storyline great dialogue great costume and great makeup
May 19 2015,positive,simply the best action movie i have ever seen
May 19 2015,positive,all five stars go to the guitar guy  spoilers
May 19 2015,positive,the best action film ive ever seen in my entire life normally my eyes glaze over during action sequences that run too long but never once in this entire clashfest did i stop paying attention
May 19 2015,positive,easily the largest scale mad max movie of them all lets get one thing straight before i start nitpicking this is a mustsee action movie this is probably the best action movie that has come out since the 80s when it movies had this kind of ultra violence and carnage from the minute the movie starts it is going at full speed and it never lets up    so with that out of the way lets get to nitpicking    first there is just so much action that it all kind of blends together that sounds kind of strange but it is just constant mayhem and destruction that thinking back on the movie i have a hard time picking out one key moment where i can say to someone remember when this doesnt mean the script is out of control or that there is too much going on to comprehend it just means that there was so much good that nothing really stood out as great    tom hardy is fine in the main role but at times it felt more like he was doing his mel gibson impersonation as opposed to making max his own he does a fine job but nothing tremendous    many probably wonder how this compares to the road warrior the often considered best of the franchise personally i think the road warrior was a better movie i just found it more memorable with moments and characters that are unforgettable plus the action while nowhere near the level of fury road was built up to as opposed to just a constant i can see why someone would like fury road more but i think the road warrior accomplished more as one of the alltime great bmovies than fury road accomplishes as a big budget hollywood film    the movie just has so much going on and its a lot of fun and there could be no dialogue at all and you would still have a great time watching this movie it is highly recommended and you need to watch it if you havent already
May 19 2015,positive,i saw this movie and loved it highly recommend
May 19 2015,positive,mad max fury road is a film that from the opening punches you in the face and continues to do so until the end and when it is over you sit there in your seat wanting to be punched over and over again a film that is going to redefine from the original the vehicle action film this film makes nearly every action film look like a cartoon of amateurs the fast series avengers and all others pale in comparison the real only thing the film lacks is character development who are these people we are rooting for we get that it is survival of the fittest but why are they the fittest and why are we watching them once you get past that which you do in about 8 minutes into the movie you sit there in awe watching the spectacle unfold before you it is so engrossing that you nearly miss the one huge blunder of the the film when they decide to turn back and go back they way they came the mountain they just passed through that was blown up is magically put back together exactly the way it was before it was blown up allowing them to pass freely i dont care i am going to see it again
May 19 2015,positive,perfect pitch perfect
May 19 2015,positive,the best movie of the series with the vision and expert pacing of miller providing the cadence epic and enthralling
May 19 2015,positive,the movie was awesome all the way and i missed the first thirty minutes
May 19 2015,positive,what a ride i love george millers crazy mind
May 19 2015,positive,its all action in a mad mad dystopia  the action never slows i saw it in 2d imax could make you dizzy the war party guitarist was the best
May 19 2015,positive,epic movie from a veteran director who shows how good movies can be with minimum cgi  results one fabulous popcorn movieinstant classic
May 19 2015,negative,why do people like this film
May 19 2015,positive,there are probably so many great reviews for this movie that there is nothing i could say that would do the film justice but if i had to only do one review for a movie this would be it  george millers vision of the apocalypse is an absolute masterpiece and will go down as one of the greatest if not the greatest action movie ever made  this movie is about a ruling tyrant whose wives are stolen from him by a rebellious imperator played by charlize theron i think what most people appreciate about a film like this is the practical effects that went into it and the extreme attention to detail to form this world that the director puts you in  these vehicles are all real and had to be built from scratch and each of them is like a character in the movie  the characters go from untrusting and ready to kill each other to sacrificing themselves to save each other  this is the ultimate heros journey story  charlize did such a great job of being a badass  tom hardy did a good job too although i wonder why mel gibson did not get asked to do the role  hugh keays byrne is the ultimate villain as immortan joe the warlord who will stop at nothing to recover his property theres too many things to list that this movie did right so just do yourself a favor and fall in love with this film like every other person who has seen it
May 19 2015,positive,this movie was a roller coaster ride very fun to watch  high action very entertaining  worth seeing in theaters
May 19 2015,negative,i wasted money and time going to this
May 19 2015,negative,what is all the hype i think people here are sarcastic i think people are going along with others the movie had no plot action was only saving factor
May 19 2015,positive,fun crazy awesome    enjoyed it very much
May 19 2015,positive,i didnt think there was enough plot but the action was good
May 19 2015,positive,this is definitely a movie for fans of the original movies mad max fury road is a action packed stunt filled roller coaster ride by director george miller in the opening of the movie max is struggling through the wastelands to survive after losing important people in his life  he is a broken man out in the middle of a sandy desert he is abducted by the war boys to be a blood bag for a sick boy nux furiosa takes a trip to collect gasoline  takes a detour as she has stolen the five breeder wives used to repopulate the war boys once the war boys figure out what furiosa is doing she has a long head start as they make chase to capture her max is strapped on the front of nuxs vehicle while still feeding him blood nux catches up to furiosa only to wreck his vehicle  free max furiosa and max dont see eye to eye at first but as the war boys army appears on the horizon they form an alliance to escape mad max fury road has some of the most insane stunts and special effects done live without cgi the story is not as detailed as the original movies but for fans who have seen the previous movies this is a spectacle to behold it will keep you on the edge of your seat till the very end definitely a must see movie
May 19 2015,positive,going in with relatively high hopes being a fan of tom bradys and the previous originals i was not disappointed in fact most scenes i was completely blown away packed with intense action and sprinkled with intelligent dialogue this is a must see for anyone who wants to finally excpereince some magic in the theater
May 19 2015,positive,best movie of 2015 iam already waiting for the bluray
May 19 2015,positive,mad max was freakin brilliant i mean it was the most intelligent action film i have seen in a very long time totally refreshing from the superhero flicks the detail in everything was amazing i was gobsmacked for much of it and loved every second not for everyone but the best in years of its genre loved it
May 19 2015,positive,it was alright first half was way better than the second half theron was great
May 19 2015,positive,nonstop freaks action and violence everything you would want from a good actionpost apocalyptic movie i really hope this isnt the last installment of this reboot because unlike the others this one actually works
May 19 2015,positive,loved this crazy movie
May 19 2015,positive,epic movie a movie i will watch again and again
May 19 2015,positive,great thrilling movie even though i dont know the whole story and the history behind the movie i can still enjoy the movie
May 19 2015,positive,take all of the mad max films and add them up then multiply by awesome i still have trouble driving normal after seeing this
May 19 2015,positive,this movie is my new all time favorite for this century well directed great storyline great color scheme just a movie that literally kept me on the edge of my seat holding a half eaten chicken tender for thirty minutes before my wife looks over at me and tells me to relax lol
May 19 2015,positive,solid all around perfectly proportioned in everything that makes a great movie
May 19 2015,negative,the movie is good but its exactly what you think it is dont look into this rt score thinking its going to be one of the best movies ever its not the plot is super thin with action from end to end forcing dialog and story to the background if you really like action movies this movie is for you if you are walking into this movie thinking it has it all then you will be disappointed
May 19 2015,positive,a fun time thats for certain
May 19 2015,positive,great reboot to the series
May 19 2015,negative,totally overrated   its a one trick pony with a long boring action scene on a truck that never ends      not what i was expecting
May 19 2015,positive,best action movie ever
May 19 2015,positive,i think this movie is slightly overrated but thats just because everyone is calling it perfect this movie is brilliant in every way and is more than worth the watch just not quite perfect
May 19 2015,positive,awesome movie so much so it is my first rating on this site
May 19 2015,positive,i havent had that feeling at the end of a science fiction movie since terminator 2 judgement day its seriously that good
May 19 2015,negative,it was horrible in all aspects they took an old movie with bad acting and just resumed it i guess if you liked the original then i can see how you could like this one dont recommend anyone to waste 2 hours watching this one
May 19 2015,positive,mad max fury road review grin emoticon  to say i was looking forward to this one is a understatement and sitting in my local imax right in the middle of row a as soon as a dirty industrial warner brothers logo appeared with the sound of mad revving engines i knew this was gonna be an experience and oh my god was it  the shear scope of this movie is so jaw dropping i had to remember to breath in and out on occasion the beautiful imagination in both plot and visuals will surely be the front runner to scoop up at oscars on the technical side next year  it would be hard to imagine anyone else taking on the role of max other than mel gibson but tom hardy fits is just great in the road warriors boots and with an amazing supporting cast makes the whole experience a absolute treat but where this movie soars is in its action and where the road warrior is considered one of the best car chase scenes ever put on film that now looks like a child playing cars in a sandbox compared to the mayhem of action seen in this flick  george miller did not have the luxury of cgi back in his day and though there is a lot used in this film where the car mayhem is concerned its bloody hard to tell what was shot for real and what was 1s  0s  for its 2 hour runtime less then 30 minutes is spent parked with just enough time to catch a breath and the rest is spent in top gear revving up the apocalyptic highway to hell gasping for breath  all in all this is a gob smacking flick that will want to viewed time and time again with the only slight disappointing thing about it is that it did not have a part from actor bruce spence  with already word of a green light for 2 more sequels to come i cant wait to see which road miller takes max rockatansky down next
May 19 2015,positive,these are the kinda movies i want to make
May 19 2015,positive,the number one complaint ive been seeing about fury road is that theres not much of a story i would respond by saying there might not be as much story as you could want but there is certainly as much as you could need the plot isnt deep or complex or intricate or philosophical but its there and it makes sense just last year john wick showed us that you can get away with a pretty thin premise if you work hard enough on building a thick palpable world and the world of fury road is something else entirely i can see why people arent blown away by the story but the world is incredible    there has been much discussion as to whether max himself or his cohort furiosa played by charlize theron is the star of the film i would argue that neither of them are director george miller is this is his vision warner brothers took a big risk when they handed a 70 year old man nearly two hundred million dollars to revitalise his franchise which has been dead for 30 years then get out of the way and let him do his thing but it paid off fury road is more of an experience than most movies are it just happens to be a great film too     the stunt work and visual effects deserve praise all to themselves according to the filmmakers roughly ten percent of all the effects were done with cgi the other ninety are practical and it oozes with that spectacle you really can feel the maximum force of the future sitting in that theatre which is a rare and unexpected pleasure    its my highest rated film of 2015 thus far in fact its one of only five films ive given more than 4 stars in the past five years so please dont take the recommendation lightly when i ask you all to go out and support this movie just make sure you do it in the biggest best quality cinema you can because this latest entry to the mad max franchise is worth it
May 19 2015,positive,best film ive seen in a long time what a lovely day
May 19 2015,positive,the action and the suspense is great  but more should have been done to explain the back story  the viewer ends up with lots of questions
May 19 2015,positive,fabulous a fitting addition to the mad max universe while the pacing suffers a little after the midpoint breather it is a spectacle to be seen    every element is crafted with care from the characters excellent use of strong female leads surprising depth from nux hoult and subtle expressions from hardy the practical stunts to the burningmangasm production design of the vehicles costumes prosthetics and locations to the cinematography and color timing to the score both the practical flamethrowingguitar and the post scoring each is executed masterfully    hopefully theyll move ahead with the possible sequels in the future
May 19 2015,positive,those vehicles belong to the horde return them now awesome mad max fan since vanilla love it great characters would love the back stories on many but thats not this movie keep up
May 19 2015,positive,perhaps the most visually captivating film in decades  and the plot is quite relevant given what we are learning about the secret world of slavery and sex trafficking
May 19 2015,positive,i thought it was the best out of the series
May 19 2015,positive,i was good but not awesome tom hardy needed more lines and cockyness to be max an expanded story would of been nice too the acting and cinematography was superb i was not disappointed in that
May 19 2015,positive,if you want a movie for deep plot lines and lots of dialogue this isnt the film for you the plot and dialogue it does have though are more than enough to move the story along it is a visual masterpiece set in a beautiful but barren environment furiosa is a perfect compliment to max as a heroine and they worked so well together if you want to watch a 2 hour joyride of mayhem and destruction go see this while it is still in theatres possibly the greatest action movie ive ever seen
May 19 2015,positive,a raw cinematic exhilaration of pure action pathos this is what a good popcorn movie looks like and proves that the genre of hardboiled brutality is alive and well one of the best films of the year
May 19 2015,positive,not boiler plate postapocalyptic scifi at all but a rather intense roller coaster ride with surprisingly sparse dialogue the only thing missing was tina turner  and isnt weird that we have had so much postapocalypses in film that there is now boilerplate in the genre this film does not disappoint
May 19 2015,positive,great movie but still we need more
May 19 2015,positive,wish there was more after the end
May 19 2015,positive,what a lovely day indeed
May 19 2015,positive,good cinematography and non stop real action not much story but still amazing
May 19 2015,positive,a production designers dream mad max comprises of relentless action most of which is sped up from the moment tom hardy switches his engine on as this is all it aims to be this is all i will judge it on  mad max boasts really exciting edgeofyourseat sequences some less exciting sitbackandwait sequences and some tiring okivehadenoughnow sequences satisfyingly the exhilerating outweighs the tedious
May 19 2015,negative,how does this movie get such high ratings i think the title should have been imperator furiosa  there and back again the art direction and cinematography are exceptional and are the stars of the show theres maybe 100 lines of dialogue in the whole movie the vehicles are more memorable than the characters and if this were the first movie in the franchise people would be left saying max who much has been made of the political text of the movie in reviews and being someone greatly annoyed and concerned with heavy handed leftist political diatribes in entertainment it is there if you want it but does not detract from the story fundamentally its ultra violent entertainment for its own sake with few other redeeming qualities
May 19 2015,positive,near perfect action film  best in recent memory surprisingly good character development for the genre too
May 19 2015,positive,it was just wow visually stunning i was one of the few women in the audience but i was there for the nostalgia the fact that to me mel gibson was one of the best looking men of his generation until johnny depp came along when the crazy flame spewing guitarist and his drummers drove past well the movie lost me for the next ten minutes as i am a guitarist and the possibiities of that was just well endless  the one thing i am really curious about not that it really matters i guess is why those guys had to be kept alive via feeding tubes blood transfusions etc my guess maybe inbreeding
May 19 2015,positive,completely bonkers but completely exhilarating the action movie of the year
May 19 2015,positive,hands down the best action film ive ever seen mindblowing and seamless effects and visual poetry
May 19 2015,positive,2 hours full packed action and not a single moment to get bored these had been the most entertaining hours inside a movie theater ive ever been to
May 19 2015,positive,now this is filmmaking at its finest i cant remember the last time ive seen an action film this gorgeous this violent and so bizarrely bonkers but also has such heart and soul to it george millers return to the franchise he created over 30 years ago is not just a standard rebootsequel but one of the most exciting and thrilling action extravaganzas in recent history the pure realism of the stunt work the chaotic frenzy of the chase scenes and the powerful performances by the likes of tom hardy and charlize theron throw you into an exhilarating thrill ride that you will want to see again and again and again for a summer lineup that is packed with overloaded cgi reboots like fantastic four and jurassic world it is so refreshing to see the now 70 year old miller put his money into practical effects work to really give you a visceral and realistic epic and my god does it work you must see this film
May 19 2015,positive,mind blowing wow a
May 19 2015,negative,modern day killing pits with tits on screen
May 19 2015,positive,thoroughly enjoyed this movie mad max is back with a bang
May 19 2015,positive,the greatest movie in the movie history it is only not one of  
May 19 2015,positive,this is why i love movies
May 19 2015,positive,mad max fury road doesnt  to the best of my recollection  pick up from where the third film ended which is fine seeing as beyond thunderdome came out the year i was born i dont recall too many specifics from the original trilogy other than it was a postapocalyptic desert australian wasteland and motorcycle and car gangs reigned supreme fury road keeps that tradition alive  at its core it is a roadchase film and is relentless throughout with everything it does from the scenery soundtrack stunts cars violence and explosions    the overthetopness serves the film well though  much in the same way 300 was hypervisualised this is the same but instead of heaps of slowmotion some of it is sped up keeping the pace of the chase buzzing it also has the same sillyness in that none of it is remotely realistic but it all works within the universe the film inhabits except for where all the fuel comes from miller mustve dreamt up most of the cartruck hybrids when he was a kid  and kudos to him for making them a reality especially the poleswinging guys and the main rig  certainly great to watch    hardy is satisfactory as max theres not many lines for the brooding hero and theron is good as the vengeful furiosa trying to protect a group of women from the evil emperor or whatever his name is  played by keaysbyrne with billy connolly hair not sure why hardy had to have a banelike face covering for some of the film after the dark knight rises  detracted a bit from the film favourite bit  the guitarist on the front of the truck loved how the drums and his riffs only came to the fore when the camera panned to them
May 19 2015,positive,this was a loud flashy 2 hour long sensory overload session  there was zero character development no real storyline to think of and after about an hour i had enough  really well done though
May 19 2015,positive,mad max fury road is one of the best looking action films ive ever seen the directing and performances are stellar and are second to none great movie and a must see for action fans but probably not one im going to jump to see again
May 19 2015,positive,this is the action movie for the nostalgic but revamped to 21st century relevance mind blowing action intense and completely absorbing right to the last scene its a shame if this goes the cult classic route it deserves a much bigger reward this is well thought out and excellently executed filmmaking plotperformancestechnical standards and most of all the spectacle best movie of the year by a very wide margin
May 19 2015,positive,well that was batshit insane
May 19 2015,negative,what a disappointing movie basically plotless  ie you could summarise it in two sentences  it is noisy ultraviolent and boring and the acting is wooden couldnt wait for it to be over
May 19 2015,positive,without doubt the best action movie of 2015 possibly of the whole decade fun solid characters in an interesting postapocalyptic storyline thats brutal inyourface  relentless such an awesome movie to experience on the big screen unlike so many these days which are seriously not worth the ridiculous cost of going to the cinema this film was worth every overpriced dollar
May 19 2015,positive,balls to the walls crazy this literal chase film is none stop crazy with spectacular stunts effects and action sequences but the aesthetic of the world is not for my tastes one viewing is enough for me
May 19 2015,positive,theres no first second or third act to mad max fury roadits all one big explosive chase thriller nicely plotted together with a  consistently intense tone that contains some of the best choreographed action pieces seen in a decade and for the whole act the movies action is crisp brutal gritty and thoroughly insane a seriously kicks ass time
May 19 2015,positive,theron and hardy stick to the book and do a good job but it is mr hoult  who steals the show
May 19 2015,positive,it was occult primates high on rocket fuel and chrome paint  getting greasefaced on a post apocalyptic chase it will keep you on the edge of your seat in the first hour and the edge of your patience in the next tom hardy manages to grunt his lines often lending his baritone to the immersive narrative charlize theron shows some brilliant resolve to doing it right it is a meltyourfaceaway nitro concoction of visuals in motion in the end you might end up asking yourself why you put yourself through george millers washing machine of cinema and the answer is simpleit is as mind numbingly immersive as the original that leaves you a feeling of being tumble dried
May 19 2015,positive,all explosions no dialogue that made much sense da fuck was that guitar guy all about weird
May 19 2015,positive,six stars of madness mad artistry  mad direction  mad performances mad max has truly returned and in the kind of adrenalized freakshow that inspires us to make movies hell this isnt a movie so much as an experience  surprises  laughs  cant wait to get back into that theatre oh furiosa thankyou george miller
May 19 2015,positive,awsome ² drop dead awesome
May 19 2015,positive,mad max fury road 2015  its a rare thing when im confident that i may have found my favorite movie of the year long before its half way mark 70 year old director george miller comes clawing vigorously back to his mad max franchise after a 30 year hiatus the film stars tom hardy charlize theron and nicholas hoult a rogue wonderer is captured by a monstrous warlord only to find himself in the middle of a vicious chase with a band of former slave women seeking hope  redemption in a post apocalyptic world with very little in supply    where do i even start with this thing ummm well this movie is freaking awesome end of review in all seriousness i literally have almost nothing bad to say about mad max fury road it left me completely speechless i felt the power of cinema in a way that personifies why i go to the movies so much to begin with not only is this a franchise best but it also is a benchmark in action movie filmmaking unmatched in probably over a decade its equally jaw dropping in its raw intensity than it is poignant in its subtlety and heart the movie takes off like a rocket from hell and literally doesnt stop for a second of its perfect 2 hour running time yet somehow the film manages to create a parallel emotional drive running alongside its manic tonality most of this comes from its lead character and if you thought that was max well youd be wrong charlize theron takes this movie by the horns and wrestles it to the ground unlike any female lead ive seen in an action movie all of the other characters have a particular illness set into their psyche which has distorted their minds to such a degree that therons portrayal of the damaged imperator furiosa becomes the relatable soul of the film this is certainly not to discredit the work of tom hardy as the titular max rockatansky who acts as a conduitvessel to see this gloriously ravaged world through his pain and distorted mind the film is very much led by his character but hes a small cog in a very big machine and thats exactly when this particular character works the best ala the road warrior because theres very little dialogue from all parties its the subtlety and physicality of the performances that really drive it home    lets talk about action for a moment ive championed practical effects in my reviews for horror films most prominently but i have given special praise to the action genre for doing the same as well the original mad max trilogy was always praised heavily even to date for its commitment to physical death defying stunt work namely in its car chase sequences well fury road takes everything youve seen before and cranks it up to 11 as a sequel should with the added advantages of modern digital effects to help enhance sequences this movie looks absolutely gorgeous the editing is almost as frantic as the characters inhabiting the world themselves but theres such a skill and purpose to every shot and cut that you just cant turn away this movies action is like a rollercoaster ride from hell where just when you think its over and you feel like you need to get off for some reason you feel compelled to stay on i just love how rich this world is without it being too obtuse or abrasive miller clearly understands his world and respects his audience enough to not spell everything out whether it be maxs tragic back story the way people live in this twisted fantasy of a world or simple character motivations and drives all of this is told with very little dialogue and distinct visual language adding layers of compelling drama on top of what is essentially one very long chase sequence of a film whats more is that you never quite feel like the main characters are safe the stakes and tension are so high and escalate so quickly that the movie never lets you take a breath not to mention because of this movies emotional narrative heft you actually care about these characters which is a tough thing in the modern blockbuster to achieve its quality stuff    whats more to say a bar has been set in this year of 2015 mad max fury road is plain and simply a modern action masterpiece its one of the best movies of the last five years and is this years crowned jewel its insanity will be too much to muster for some but for those who were intrigued by trailers action movie junkies or fans of the franchise put this on your must see list now its a heavy metal orchestra of blood metal and sand unlike anything ive ever seen before well worth the highest admission price even in 3d now thats saying something    grade a
May 19 2015,negative,most overrated film ever its the kind of story you could write with your friends in 30 mins i cant see any difference between this film and waterworld in terms of its contribution to human culture its like watching a youtube video of someone playing a video game if you have ever wondered about the value of a car chase to a narrative structure dont even think about going to see thjs film style is elevated so far above substance it has vertigo totally unconvincing human relationships more a celebration of malevolence than anything else just when you think there cant be any more exploding spears bouncing off truck metal another 100 feral bikers appear for another round and then again and again if you look up this film on flixster and wonder who the 1 who didnt like this film are please count me among them
May 19 2015,positive,this is an adrenaline rush from start to finish its bonkers intensely visual vicious and slightly scary and i guarantee youll leave the cinema  as i did  thinking i dont think ive ever seen anything like that before  the entire film is a beautifully choreographed chase across the desert with masterfully crafted setpieces coming thick and fast brilliant stuff
May 19 2015,positive,the 30 year wait has been worth it what an incredible movie it is frenetic from the first frame until after a few minutes you get a chance to take a breath before the next bout of action occurs mad max is absolutely stunning with its brilliant cinematography powerful soundtrack wonderful machines and quirky characters but this movie is more than just action there are clever references to the role of women in society stolen children destruction of the environment power by controlling of natural resources and various religious beliefs there are so many levels in this wonderfully rendered story that it will bear watching many times over the acting is great with tom hardy and charlize theron putting in terrific performances the choreography of the fight scenes are totally extreme and eyepopping the experience is exhilarating and wonderfully exhausting there is a selfcontained story so you dont need to have seen the previous mad max movies mad max must be an oscar contender this year in multiple categories  if you are going to see this you must see it at the cinema and in 3d if you miss this then you are crazier than the characters in the movie wonderful
May 19 2015,positive,epic thrilling experience thats what this is best action of the year
May 19 2015,positive,charlize should of been mad max ine
May 19 2015,positive,best movie of 2015 so far
May 19 2015,positive,mad max 2 the road warrior this is not but everything about it was fantastic great carnage and i cant get over how well hardy channeled mels max right down to mannerisms i swear gibson dubbed his voice but i just cant accept it as a mad max movie a movie set in the same universe with max passing through definitely if you are going to title mad max have him be a real part of things
May 19 2015,positive,this warts and all portrayal of modern day australia should serve as a powerful reminder to everyone in the developed world about how good we have it    a master class in cinematography it still maintains the handmade feel and gritty realism that permeate through the best nonfiction films
May 19 2015,positive,the big screen revival of australian ozploitation icon max rockatansky follows the exceptional reboot formula inviting old and new fans into the mix of things the films contemplates a high driven explosive testosterone filled actionadventure chase in a daring and completely insane postapocalypseendofcivilization settings regardless of the talent at work this is australian ozploitation on an international scale with some of the most amazing stunts set pieces action sequences and immersive world ridden politics gone mad the best part is this series hasnt lost any of its aussie touches and keeps the viewers glued to their seats from the beginning to the end possibly the best action film of 2015 and must for exceptional cases be seen on the big screen
May 19 2015,positive,from george millers mad mind with mad mad action
May 19 2015,positive,loved it non stop action with enough story to have it make sense perfect action movie
May 19 2015,positive,there is so much good in this movie  probably the best decision is that the movie is basically about nux a small character who gets wrapped up in the fates of these larger than life characters furiosa max  allowed us to learn about the world through his actions but also follow some kind of journey through a character  hardy as max is revelatory and i can find basically no fault with it even though it is half bane and half alfie solomons  the return of hugh keaysbyrne to a mad max film is just omg i have no words for how lovely a day it is  and the design and plot for furiosa is just wow  the way they handled disability was just unbelievably good  but i struggled with theron in the role of furiosa  i just had so much trouble believing she was this hardened killer who hid her humanity long enough to become an imperator to make her daring escape  i felt no tension between the lie she had to live and the killing she most certainly had to do and the character of the savior to these enslaved women  her remember me to immortan joe fell completely flat because we never knew her as a loyal member of his army her betrayal is unexpected and contentless  halfway through the movie i found her a bit more palatable but how much of that was just getting used to it and how much of it was a shift in performance i dont know    however apart from that quibble a lovely day  let us all ride immortal shiny and chrome through the highways of valhalla  i live i die  i live again    witness me
May 19 2015,positive,totally worth all the hype built up behind it  fury road retained everything that made the road warrior such an electrifying adrenaline rush of action and set it ablaze  you have no idea how refreshing it is to watch vehicular mayhem that isnt marred by excessive cgi  the stunts and metallic carnage are the real deal    mad max is definitely back in full form and with the recent announcement of his next film wasteland the only bad thing i can point out is the time we have to spend waiting for it to come out
May 19 2015,positive,nothing made sense in the movie the best part of the movie is the guitar man tom hardy was pretty much the same character as in the movie lawless hes still great though the movie would probably be better if they made it  r rated
May 19 2015,positive,incredible so different weird and creative action is impeccable not only great but had a very real feel to it probably because of how much practical effects and real stunts were used surprisingly deep for this kind of movie phenomenal original score might be my favorite so many intense suspenseful and epic scenes i was on the edge of my seat throughout i said thats the coolest thing ive ever seen about 47 times during the movie witness me the sandstorm scene is probably my favorite action sequence ever same with the jumping motorcycles and the final battle so much about this movie is elite the directing the action the score the cinematography the acting by the three leads hardy theron hoult the imaginative world that was created the creativity of the characters on my 8th viewing i was so blown away that i decided to give it my imaginary 55 rating only other movie ive given that to is interstellar as of now mad max fury road is my second favorite movie of all time it makes me happy    9 viewings
May 19 2015,positive,this relentless high velocity travel through distopia makes for a furious fusion of full on road action and futuristic movie fun great stuff i recommend it una clive
May 19 2015,negative,ive never felt so worn out after watching a movie nothing else to the story but a car chase from beginning to end
May 19 2015,positive,finally got to see this and its beautiful
May 19 2015,positive,this is probably one of my favorite action movies of all time the action was exhilarating the quiet moments were surprisingly tender and the score melted my face off it was a purely visceral experience and i loved every second of it
May 19 2015,positive,a fully realized world odd engaging and visually stunning
May 19 2015,positive,perhaps the most satisfying action packed movie i have seen in a while
May 19 2015,positive,this the craziest nonstop action movie made this decade micheal bay wishes he was this talented dc wants this director for justice league this movie is truly worthy   its a drop everything and see it kinda movie
May 19 2015,positive,ive been a fan of the series since viewing the road warrior and this film is an amazing addition to the series
May 19 2015,positive,symphony of action thriller under george millers direction   beautifully insane
May 18 2015,negative,over rated watch someone drive into the desert and then turn around and drive back
May 18 2015,positive,a little over the top with action a totally worn out storyline
May 18 2015,positive,what a day what a lovely day     this movie is by far the best this year and its not even close the visuals were amazing and the two leads were great the trailers were really misleading from the trailers it looked like non stop action but the movie had plenty of story to it also check it out now
May 18 2015,positive,its pretty much everything a mad max movie should be  the art department did a fantastic job on this  so did everyone else  theron and hardy are excellent and well cast  so are the other actors  the 3d was really good though a conversion job  an easy recommend
May 18 2015,positive,one of the best cinematic events of the decade
May 18 2015,positive,it will keep you at the end of your seata must see movie
May 18 2015,positive,this fury road is like an adrenaline rush its wild insane and yes its mad summer is seriously getting hotter
May 18 2015,neutral,i love the road warrior  this was not the road warrior
May 18 2015,negative,im really surprised it is rated as high as it is i would actually give it 2 stars but its so high it doesnt matter  its basically a 2 hour action car chase with some semblance of a storydialogue vaguely in the background noise
May 18 2015,positive,over the top and very self aware of it this movie goes a million miles an hour with flawless and mind melting action with a quick paced filming style that will make the viewer just as mad as the title character
May 18 2015,positive,mad max fury road is in the running for my favorite film of 2015 george miller returns with a vengeance in a sleek wellmade action movie that blows its competition in the decades since beyond thunderdome he really puts other directors to shame with this movie showing how powerful a movie can be especially when its shot so well and attention to fine details are paid most of the film is actually practical effects as well making it even more impressive and i didnt begrudge the minor use of cgi at all it was used sparingly and effectively as it should be unfortunately it probably wont be appreciated by modern audiences who cant tell the difference or dont care its also good that they didnt try and retell maxs backstory or try to make him the central character he hasnt been that since the first film and is always just there to be a part of the world as a whole bottom line fury road is a masterpiece and one of the most engaging action movies in years
May 18 2015,positive,what a lovely day not sure why we havent made one of these every three years for the last thirty
May 18 2015,negative,this must come with a warningterrible movieas i walked from the theatreno messing i double checked i watch the correct movie as everyone else the preceded to check that flixster didnt make a mistake in their score imbd also has it highthis is a warningthis is a terrible pile of horse st
May 18 2015,positive,this movie had me out of my seat from start to finish tom hardy is always great seriously badass movie highly recommended
May 18 2015,positive,great direction in this exciting super intense and original action packed thriller
May 18 2015,positive,not for everyone but its a rare transcendent film experience anyone with an appreciation of film or anyone who loves action great photography or fun in general must see
May 18 2015,positive,pure adrenalinei prefer the road warrior but this is a visually worthy tribute
May 18 2015,negative,if you had no interest in watching this other than seeing it got 98 on rotten tomatoes then dont see it i give it a 75  just giving one star to even things out a bit
May 18 2015,positive,i loved it no pretense no bs all action  with a point or two that holds it all together beginning to end it combines any motorheads dream of perversely beautiful 16 8 4 and 2wheelers with just the right amount of isolated humanity in the leads with weird diabolical evildoers trying to capture a handful of gorgeous or pregnant nubiles spirituality comes from the search for redemption charlize represents with salt and pepper romantic tension with max  but the motorized action in symbolic landscapes adds the critical gestalt to the movie making it almost an allegory on the ageold theme of survival in search of a purpose vulnerabilty and bravery overcoming destruction and madness  cool i say  im going to gather a few friends and go see it again    cfbenz
May 18 2015,positive,this movie was amazing it was full of excitement twist and turns and will have you at the edge of your seats a must see
May 18 2015,positive,a masterpiece the film creates a vividly imaginative world that feels real and never contrived
May 18 2015,positive,that was fantastic nonstop action best action movie of the year so far its amazing how a director can develop characters to that level while constantly moving amazing special effects stunts artwork and a great cast
May 18 2015,positive,mad max fury road the return of george millers explosive imagination is back in full swing without loosing an ounce of elegance rage or heart the way fury road ties in with the original mad max films is incredible in its own regards the film not only stays true to the original three films but adds to themmaking the most recent installment the most relevant the series has ever been the droughts in california the alwaysgrowing topic of feminism these are all current and important issues that are woven into the concept of fury road in a clever and often brilliant manner the most badass character in the entire movie possibly ends up being imperator furiosa played by a revved up stunning charlize theron the journey starts right away causing two heroic characters max and furiosa to collide in a smart and descriptive manner their relationship is unique both trapped in this insane earth forced to believe that everyone around them is sane that idea did not sink in fast however after glazing at the movies shock factor for the first hour my eyes began to see the film in a new light it instantly turned from an expensive exquisite summer blockbuster into something much more thoughtful the idea soon became a horror almost a warning to us as humans the concept of fury road is more shocking than a mad max film has ever been and it totally works the classic villain the hero nux and all of the incredible female leads fits the new installment of mad max right into the history books as what will prove to be one of the most cherished action films of our generation now many classics are flawed and mad max is no exception the beginning kicks off the film in a queesy and mind throbbing manner and may turn away some impatient viewers but once you are fully submerged into the flames of fury road it is an experience to remember the car crashes are staged to perfection the music is emotionally compelling and the character development left and right is thrilling these are creative characters and thoughtful ones too they all have their own backstory which makes fury road such a one of a kind summer blockbuster this is a senior director at his best this is a director who built over what he once created setting flame to the movie screens with a fueled grim and intensely vivid snapshot of his imagination mad max fury road all in all is the most anyone could have asked for with a two hour follow up to the punkinspired series its mean very explosive and unexpectedly heartfelt exactly what the film had to be to allow george millers epic legacy to maintain a beyond perfect reputation
May 18 2015,negative,lots of action but boring story line with predictable plot
May 18 2015,positive,i came into this film with much knowledge of the older films other than mel gibson used to play max i can best describe this film as a carnival in a foreign country where nobody speaks your language and everyone is a little too weird its a fantastic film with brilliant visuals and sound production its typical of good summer block buster but the story is also engaging for this dystopian epic even though the film is based in a vast desert landscape you feel as though the characters are trapped in bottle that is humanities fouls i highly recommend this film for any fan of something big loud and satisfying
May 18 2015,positive,this movie is a straightup adrenaline rush thrill ride one of the best if not the best action movie in the last decade im docking half a point for the movie not being completely clear storywise if you have never seen a mad max movie but even if you havent seen a single one dont let that stop you from experiencing this monster of a film buckle your seatbelt
May 18 2015,positive,mad max is set in a gritty post apocalyptic world where water is scarce and women are treated like property with the war boys having kidnapped mad max to use as a universal blood donor he appears to be permanently inslaved he is freed when nux and the war boys go chasing after furiosa who has freed the warlords wives max crosses paths with the women and over time assists on the escape     this movie has it all action drama and car chases the stunts were all practical and hardly any cg was used they built all the cars you see in the movie tom hardy and most of the cast did a bulk of their own stunts    visually it was incredible between the action the cinematography the costumes and the cars charlize theron was incredible as furiosa tom hardy was quiet and brooding as max nicholas  hoults character nux was emotionally compelling     i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and will be going to the theatre again to see it in 2d as i first saw it in 3d i hear the colors pop even more when it is not 3d
May 18 2015,positive,only need six words to describe thisthe best movie of the year
May 18 2015,positive,the art of destruction
May 18 2015,positive,i went into the theater expecting to enjoy max max fury road but i didnt expect to be blown away  i was blown away  at one point in the movie i found myself laughing out loud not at the absurdity of the film but more like the laughter of a kid on a speeding twisting looping roller coaster  this movie was fun in a way i havent experienced in a theater in decades  its a ram air supercharged dystopian steampunk demolition derby on steroids that somehow introduces characters that you give a damn about  and it is all played out on a breathtaking cinematic canvas like a 4th of july finale  i saw this in real 3d and i highly recommend doing the same
May 18 2015,positive,mad maxfury road mad max was directed by george miller and was a little disapointing in some ways for me but i still enjoyed it and thought it was good i am going to talk about the positives tom hardy was cool the action was spectacular the film looked amazing the special and visual effects were outstanding and the score was great and really matched the movie alot of great stunt work from tom hardy and the cast now i will be getting into the negative side of this film i liked tom hardy as max but he didnt really add alot to this movie yes he had the great scene of him trying to steal a truck from a group of women then failing but like he didnt have character and i bareley cared about him same as all the other characters i didnt like the other characters in fact i could bareley take them seriously the best part of this movie for tom hardy was probably the beginning when he was getting chased by all these pale people and it was creepy as shit and i didnt want max to get caught by those guys but after he did get caught by those men i didnt care about max or any other characters i dont even understand what the plot really is because it was literally pretty much action the whole time there is nothing wrong with that but it just gets a little bit old when you see some pale white dude with a fucked up face playing a flamethrower guitar like what anyways it just had character flaws and story flaws that i expected alot more from due to all the hype i was a little disapointed considering this has a 98 on rt but its whatever it was good just not as good as i thought i still had a good time with mad max and i guess i could reccomend it to some people but i feel like it isnt for everyone but apparently it is for everyone considering since everyone literally says its amazing but i still liked it
May 18 2015,negative,guitar guy gives it a star
May 18 2015,positive,on the edge of your seat kind of movie that i love
May 18 2015,positive,i didnt care for this much the first time so i watched it again because i thought the house might have killed it i was right way better the second time just go into this knowing its just one huge chase scene with barely any plot the action is amazing im not sure how at least 30 stunt men werent killed making this movie a must see for stunts alone the guitar guy is the best
May 18 2015,positive,i absolutely loved the first 3 mad max movies so when they decided to do a sequel i was all for it it was action packed but for some reason left me wanting more i felt like i had seen it all before and tom hardy as mad max did nothing for me it was almost like he had no character  cant beat mel gibson he had a dark side plus a little added humour to a darker plot
May 18 2015,positive,meh no story all effects
May 18 2015,positive,yes it is that good
May 18 2015,positive,i dont think i unclenched once during the entire movie
May 18 2015,positive,js    very  very  good movie  i was impressed with the fact that there was no profanity and really no blood and guts
May 18 2015,positive,excellent awesome fantastic intense my husband and i loved it
May 18 2015,positive,it was a old school kind of movie i love it
May 18 2015,positive,now this is a summer action flick i think the director said remember the road warrior and the talky parts that kind of slowed things down lets do it again and replace the talky parts with car chases and explosions actually miller creates perfectly orchestrated anarchy to the screen hardy does a good job as max but theron takes the lead for most of the movie this orgy for the eyes is definitely one to see on the big screen
May 18 2015,positive,by far the best out of all the series 
May 18 2015,positive,krs haiku review  a reboot done right  great action amazing stunts  allaround badass
May 18 2015,positive,ill curse everyone who doesnt like this movie
May 18 2015,positive,exploded my mind i need to get on this ride again
May 18 2015,positive,i walked out of this movie beaming because i had the biggest shit eating grin on my face i still cant believe this movie exists go see it
May 18 2015,positive,forget pitch perfect and and go see a heartpumping asterpiece
May 18 2015,positive,from start to finish its bat shit high octane insanity
May 18 2015,positive,a pure masterpiece from start to finish i loved it 
May 18 2015,positive,a rare treat  an action blockbuster that does not leave me alienated or trivialised as a female themes of breakdown of civilisationauthoritarian rule control of resources and rebellion were all too real it was gripping
May 18 2015,positive,if you go in knowing the movie is one long car chase filled with violence and symbolism youre going to love it the visuals are stunning and the world is fleshed out without shoving every detail down your throat you definitely do not have to know anything about the mad max world to enjoy this film
May 18 2015,positive,lives up to the hype it is like 1980s action good
May 18 2015,positive,the closest youll get nowadays to a big budget movie with a great script
May 18 2015,positive,its a story of survival of a search for home of the costs of ecological failure and moral decay after a great war     and in true mad max fashion its a crazy fast ride of chaos anger vengeance and perhaps a hope for redemption      well done
May 18 2015,positive,sfx end stunts are amazing but dont expect anything more from this film
May 18 2015,positive,was a really great nonstop action flick
May 18 2015,positive,for all the road warrior mad max fans who awaited the return of the apocalyptic hero this movie is not it  this is definitely a film that was written for charlize theron who from the start is fullyincontrol as the lone ranger type with max relegated to being her sidekick tonto and as we all know tonto got few lines and few moments of glory no amount of great cinematography and art direction can make up for a bad script and story line but even that would have been tolerable if the character of mad max had not been so greatly diminished this film was highly anticipated for many reasons one being the return of george miller director of the mad max franchise for me that was a shocker as wellthat he would lend his talents to a sequel that reduces the hero of the franchise to no more than a boring supporting role my husband summarized it best when at the end of the movie he said it was all just baitandswitch i have to agree
May 18 2015,positive,i wish i could give it more stars
May 18 2015,positive,finally a change in the way movies are done but actually in a good way
May 18 2015,negative,not sure where the story was on this one probably lost somewhere in the numerous explosions and crappy epic style camera work
May 18 2015,positive,definitely a fitting tribute to the original mad max movies the cars carnage the whole ball of wax
May 18 2015,positive,other action films are gonna have to try harder this is a game changer
May 18 2015,positive,glad george miller directed this  no one couldve copied his glorious effedupness
May 18 2015,positive,the movie was absolutely fantastic great action and special effects a must watch
May 18 2015,positive,pure action and extremely beautiful
May 18 2015,positive,was never a fan of the original mad maxbut thanks to one of my friends he told me how great the movie was andwowi loved itthis is one of the very few movies i would be willing to watch again
May 18 2015,positive,finally a movie that lives up to the hype im so sick and tired of cgi cartoon choreography from transformers to avengers every scene feels as if it was planned and rehearsed by actors with ping pong balls attached to their tights in front of giant green screens  and the entire point of seeing those movies is to be in awe of what computers can do now no thanks  in 1981 i saw the road warrior on vhs i must have hit the rewind button 10 times to figure out if the stunts were real or not  that is how you made a great movie  michael bay needs to take notes on fury road the scenes were so epic so large so thrilling so real  i went in to this movie looking for cgi i found a little bit here and there but the fuel and oil and gasoline and fire were too big to real to be missed  the plot is good the action is unmatched you will not see another movie like this the entire year maybe the entire decade lets hope im wrong and the next transformers has less computers and more action sequences like the opening before the credits this movie grabs you from the very beginning and doesnt let go  its a must see in the theater youll regret it if you dont
May 18 2015,positive,with its literally insane and frentic energy mad max fury road never slows downits nonstop from begin to end with its mindblowing action sequences colorful and beautiful direction and just overall uniqueness fury road is unlike anything youve ever seen before and probably anything you ever will you truly get a feeling of being mad while you watch this film from the main star hearing voices in his head to an old lady smiling when she gets a headshot youll feel insane by the credits start rolling its easily the best postapocalyptic youll ever see and i dont hesitate in calling it the best action film ever
May 18 2015,positive,seeing this movie was like riding a rollercoaster for a solid 25 hours
May 18 2015,positive,all action i loved this movie and i cant wait to see it again
May 18 2015,positive,masterpiece film of this year
May 18 2015,positive,entertaining as hell  action from beginning to end  what a day what a lovely day an instant classic  needs to be seen more than once
May 18 2015,positive,insane and relentless  if that sounds like something you might enjoy you gotta experience this
May 18 2015,positive,amazing this movie made me want to watch it over again only minutes after i was through watching it the first time the acting was outstanding and the storyline fantastic  george miller has another hit definitely worth to watch on the big screen i am a huge fan of all things fantasy and science fiction and this is definitely the movie i have been waiting for
May 18 2015,negative,no redeeming features as the main character seeks redemption so much more does this movie
May 18 2015,positive,one of the greatest action movies of all time george miller surprised us again when you watch the movie the only thing that comes to your mind is what a lovely day you buy what you want to see action
May 18 2015,negative,not my cup of tea fell asleep
May 18 2015,positive,visually and musically delicious very artistic in all aspects except the screenplay what little dialog there was felt very forced and poorly written but again this weakness could almost be seen as a tool in achieving the overall brutal and silent beauty of this film the dichotomy of beautiful operatic visualsmusic and gritty cringe worthy violence made for an extremely unique atmosphere overall an extremely refreshing cinematic experience
May 18 2015,positive,this may be the best action movie ive ever seen its an insane bizarre nonstop adrenaline rush that puts forth one mindblowing set piece after another a mustsee
May 18 2015,negative,one of the movies i actually walked out an hour into the movie a waste of my tome and money  pointless and depressing
May 18 2015,positive,a pretty good action movie admirably done mostly with real vehicles and stunts wish it had a single compelling character or an involving plot
May 18 2015,negative,who is giving this a good rating its two hours of blowing up cars and mutants in the desert i have no idea where they find this narrative heft but it was not in the movie i watched this moving felt more like something id watch for laughs on the syfy channel than a major motion picture this moving ranks with sharknado 3
May 18 2015,positive,mad max is an extremely entertaining and stunning masterpiece the movie is full of action and suspense thrilling and impossible to predict but easy to follow all the way through
May 18 2015,positive,mad max is almost hypnotically rousing bleak and gritty while also vibrant and gorgeous a heavy film delicately handled with care and attention to detail tonality and the unlikely characters it creates
May 18 2015,positive,the car chases are incredible in this movie the characters and the overall story is odd and fair but the fight scenes and the car chasing scenes make this movie awesome to watch the guy playing guitar on the car is bad ass i want one of those guys lol
May 18 2015,positive,best mad max in the series highly recommend to go watch even if you havent seen the first 3 fastly paced and never misses a beat youre always at the edge of your seat with this rollercoaster ride
May 18 2015,positive,although it doesnt exactly tie into the previous mad max movies this is an amazing movie  there is very little dialog but tons and tons of action and it looks amazing  theres not an overload of cgi but i sure hope some of it was cgi or else some stuntmen were killed during the filming   two of the coolest things when they are heading into a huge sandstorm and the one member of immortan joes posse called the doof warrior  this guy plays guitar on a large truck which carries enough speakers that would put a major rock  roll concert to shame  and the guitar shoots fire  its so crazy but it is really cool    go see this movie
May 18 2015,positive,action packed and unique  if you liked sin city youll probably like this  even sin city had more story then this
May 18 2015,positive,they just dont make action movies like this anymore this was beautifully shot as well and the way it ended made you want more of this fictional world
May 18 2015,positive,this is the first time in a long time ive seen a action packed movie with such artful cinematics
May 18 2015,positive,one of if not the best action films ive ever seen visually  stunning epic masterpiece
May 18 2015,positive,strange disturbing ugly powerful
May 18 2015,positive,a great summer movie see it in 3d if you can
May 18 2015,positive,tom hardy isnt as believable as mad max as mel gibson but other than that this movie knocks it out of the park charlize theron was amazing special effects  stunts were spectacular visually stunning      loved it
May 18 2015,positive,exciting investing and with a great story and one long action sequence mad max 4 exceeds every expectation
May 18 2015,positive,thoroughly enjoyed it  the action movie of the summer 
May 18 2015,positive,killer action movie  starts off shout out of a cannon and just rolls through an amazing assortment of action battle and dramatic scenes  recommended
May 18 2015,neutral,acting was horrible plot was super dumb the action was 5 stars though
May 18 2015,positive,well written well acted  great special effects
May 18 2015,positive,a rare example of not being over hyped
May 18 2015,positive,its like that guy from the raid but made out of cars fighting that other guy from the raid also made of cars in a desert in the future
May 18 2015,positive,a gorgeous fulltilt thrillride brilliantly cast perfectly pitched and all a fan of the previous films could hope for
May 18 2015,positive,an absolute spectacle that reminds us why we love to go to the movies
May 18 2015,positive,id only seen the first mad max movie before i saw this one does it make more sense if youve seen the road warrior and beyond thunderdome
May 18 2015,positive,by far one of the best constructed action flicks ever complete with subtle tinges of social commentary and artistic design that blows most movies way out of the water
May 18 2015,positive,not sure if i didnt get the story or if it was very confusing nevertheless it was entertaining and the action scenes were great
May 18 2015,positive,weird wild and relentless  a pure exercise in action film making  fury road is one of the best films i have seen in years
May 18 2015,positive,super weird loved it
May 18 2015,positive,this film is mad it does not stop i love mad max before this mad max 2 was my fave but hardy makes a great max but theron is amazing providing an anchor paula my wife said it was good but there was no let up thats why this is now my fave mad max film pure escapisium that gives no chance for your mind to wander into real life
May 18 2015,positive,very good action scenes and acting
May 18 2015,positive,insane action watched it in a normal cinema but i think it would blow your mind in imax
May 18 2015,positive,this is one of the few movies that you have to see on the big screen  the bar for all movies this year has officially been raised great movie go see it
May 18 2015,positive,pretty much perfection in the form of action i havent seen a studio make a big budget movie like this in a long time relentless and fast paced and wonderfully directed fury road delivers the best action movie ive seen in years
May 18 2015,positive,awesome the best chase movie in years and equally a woman movie brilliant
May 18 2015,positive,a beautifully creative circus of mayhem like no other
May 18 2015,positive,george miller goes full blast all out madness in this post apocalypse off road movie i dont think ive been in a cinema which was so loud the practical effects are top notch and the visuals for the most part subtle although there were a few dodgy moments while the movie is called mad max he kinda takes a back seat to charllize theron who has not been this good in a long time she is a bonafide movie star tom hardy is a little subdued in the lead and does not have the charisma of gibson but is good nonetheless if your looking for a good time at the cinema this week look no further than this
May 18 2015,positive,this movie is one giant punch of awesome to the face and you immediately thank it and ask for another    you can read my full review at    
May 18 2015,positive,just saw it it is awesome dont believe the critics who said its antimale feminist propaganda it is not its anti dictator and the visuals and stunts are the best ever its like the best mad max gag ever  every time they do something it never gets boring and the sets and costumes are over the top awesome its almost a steam punk movie its bad a 
May 18 2015,positive,mad max fury road is a movie with pretty much no plot and the only thing they foucus on is violence mad max fury road is action packed and filled with violence alright
May 18 2015,positive,loved it its loud filled with action and is really a bit mental
May 18 2015,positive,i was exhausted at the end of the movie i was blown away full throttle from start to finish
May 18 2015,negative,cool action but not enough dialogue to care about what was going on in the fight scenes
May 18 2015,positive,about as exciting and interesting as any action movie has any business being i had a blast from start to finish and everyone is a part of the treat that is this movie you will not be dissapointed
May 18 2015,positive,excellent action flickfasten your seat belts and enjoy the trip for 2 hours of a wild ridegreat cast
May 18 2015,positive,great movie never a dull moment action though out basically a hugh rat race   should have been called mad maxine for charlize theron she was great
May 18 2015,positive,if you are thinking about seeing mad max fury road go see it it is action movie story telling nirvana mad max fury road features another sublime performance by tom hardy as max and perhaps not since sigourney weaver in 1986 aliens has there been such an indelible female hero as charlize therons imperator furiosa the film is full of smart spectacular dramatic action that makes current recent films seem anemic puny or even illogical in their own constructed universes i am thinking of you avengers age of ultron and you furious 7 if anyone would look at the trailer and think the film looks bonkers they would be correct it is spectacularly bonkers fast and intense with sprinklings of humor a chase film from beginning to end that never lags set in a dystopia future where the powerful command the weak by their control of scarce resources water food gas the look of the film is unique and perhaps off putting the story while packed with violence and action is never sadistic think instead to a straight forward western where the black hat villains and the white hat good guys are quite clearly portrayed as what they are and that even the young soldiers who seek glory in battle at the service of the overlord villain can be redeemed with a little change in their perspectiveobvious thought has gone into the story of mad max fury road yet it does not steep itself in profound themes or statements rather it is profound in how entertaining and skillful an action film still can be great movie
May 18 2015,positive,mad max like the frankencars that are its soul is pieced together from exactly the number of moving parts required to make it fast loud and exhilarating â its a master class of streamlined efficiency and a testament to what expert craftsmen can produce when their passions are indulged    its packed so thick with gorgeous cinematography and vehicular insanity that its finer points  charlise therons smoldering intensity a feminist message thats never peachy and a thundering propulsive soundtrack  work on an almost subconscious level â which is good cause your brains gonna need all its processing power to wrap itself around fury roads poetic chaos    its like having a stupid grin punched onto your face    a lovely day indeed
May 18 2015,positive,eh cool effects storyline was no bueno
May 18 2015,positive,it was pretty dang good
May 18 2015,positive,this movie was simply amazing in every way  the world was chaotic beauty the characters were damaged and real the music was captivating and the visuals were unmatched by anything ive seen in a move to date  go see this movie
May 18 2015,positive,marmite movie youll hate it for the lack of exposition plot and tom hardy nudity or youll love it for its retro b movie schtick with blockbuster budget and carazy action sequences or youre me and was a bit in between  38 dune 1984  08 mad max 1979  24 mad max the road warrior 1981  16 mad mad beyond the thunderdome 1985  05 moonraker 1979  05 raiders of the lost arc 1981  02 smokey  the bandit 1977  02 zero dark thirty 2014
May 18 2015,positive,wow i really enjoyed this the time flew by and a worthy addition to the mad max films  tom hardy and charlize theron together  fab although charlize stole the show 
May 18 2015,positive,whoa must see in 3d  does not disappoint probably the best mad max the the franchise to date i want more
May 18 2015,positive,the first 10 minutes are intense and are an excellent setup for the entire movie  i didnt need any backstory lore about the war boys because its obvious who they are and their purpose  when we move from this to hardys character being strapped on a car i was deeper in the lore  the reason he goes for the ride explains a lot about motivations and was very well done  therons character development was a little slower and though everything in the movie is exciting i thought this bit could have been shortened  when we understand her motivation and the level of risk becomes evident its like a spark is lit and it flames throughout the rest of the movie  by the end i saw theron pull out her amazing range of acting skills  she and hardy are terrific together  i hope hoult is recognized by everyone for his great work here  i imagine its hard to show subtlety in a role thats so fever pitched but he managed to do it  his arc is the most interesting  as for the stunts what can i say that hasnt been said  theyre brilliant  i can imagine how grueling it was to film this and i could see that experience in the actors performances  not on the actors themselves so well done them for not allowing their own misery to seep through  yes the pole guys are cool the guitar shredder is cool and the costumes are super cool and true to other mad maxs films  i need to see it again to really appreciate everything vintage cars being one aspect id like to study frame by frame  the gratuitous waterhosebabe scene was funny and good  finally isnt everyone a little more in love with theron hardy and hoult after this
May 18 2015,negative,max should have simply been removed from this movie as his roll wasnt impressive whatsoever  it is as if the producers asked themselves what was the greatest thing about the second and third movie  answer  the car chase  reply great lets make the entire movie a 120 minute car chase    the car chases were great but they did not make the story  the story behind this release is hidden in the shadows  often times their dialog was muffled especially when they are using terms or sayings that only have meaning within their world so as a viewer youre left with what did they just say  oh nevermind must not matter      the stunt work was great the characters were cool vehicles were awesome in their design but the story was severely lacking soundtrack was heavy in its presence
May 18 2015,positive,the best film ive seen since inception
May 18 2015,positive,i was never a huge mad max fan i def enjoyed the first 2 tho i cant say i was that pumped about this when i first heard about it however i was sold after i saw the first trailer and then all the rave reviews i have to say it warrants all the hype its one of the best action films ive ever seen the film is essentially just one long chase sequence filled with bizarre over the top designs and characters and cars and stunts its on a scale unlike any of the previous films in the series its true that theres little characterization or backstory but its not needed i had enough to care for the characters if i had one small quibble its that i wish there were more scenes with immortan joe and the other villains since they seemed so cool and interesting hardy doesnt say a whole lot but theron and hoult make memorable characters a great exciting score by junkie xl as well if they make a sequel i literally have no idea how this could be topped but id love to see miller try as of now my favorite film of 2015
May 18 2015,positive,i have to admit at first i was like really a mad max reboot without mel gibson but then got excited after seeing all the reviews  unfortunately the excitement quickly faded about halfway through  while it is a decent movie it really just didnt do much for me great visual effects but story was thin and dry i left the movie feeling much like an infant that was distracted with a set of car keys for 2 hours
May 18 2015,positive,was better than i thought great fight scenes
May 18 2015,negative,movie garbage please dont waste your money
May 18 2015,negative,i continuously question my judgement when i read and sometimes heed the film ratings on flixsters rotten tomatoes i can count on one finger the number of times tomatoes and i have agreed and that was back in 1975 with stephen spielbergs blockbuster jaws    but its a monday i didnt want to think i had a fantastic but tiring weekend full of friends family and a few cocktails here and there its hot and its humid and it looks like thunderstorms are forecast in the afternoon so why dont i take advantage of having a theater complex to myself to go get lost in a highly rated  97 from critics and film goers much anticipated presummer action packed apocalyptic special effects filled 3d version of director george millers mad max fury road besides my chores can wait    first the good news    the seat in the theater was a power recliner    charlize theron plays a vehicle driver in the film love her not here though her beautiful eyes and her hateful glare work for the first 10 minutes they digitally removed forearm as a kind of war wound thing but it wasnt really necessary tom hardy who tackles mad max has lips that flow right into tomorrow however i felt that the automobilerobottruckjeep like contraptions used as war machines had more acting ability and chemistry on screen did that sound too harsh even the villains were one dimensional and almost comical in appearance the infantman creature in the opening scene reminded me of munchkinland was that intentional did i miss something    as a member of the audience were along for the ride as the heroes attempt to get to the land of green i guess thats an analogy for summer blockbuster cash people are either excruciatingly poor and destitute disfigured or painted white with black eyes this is most likely an attempt at class or social structure but i didnt get it    i love special effects and 3d really i do and this film was no exception to providing a mindblowing stuntfilled in your face spectacle but two hours worth i must be getting old but i enjoy a little plot maybe some political undertone perhaps a character or two that i care about or even a little comedic relief i found nothing in this film that resembled any of these     car chase scenes sure i loved the french connection 1971 when the vehicles screeched underneath elevated train bridges through the city but it supplemented the oscar winning film not dominated it mad max was filled with dessert and dust filled chases where the hero theron or hardy not really sure was trying to get a truck of breeder women who all looked as though they were chosen from page of an abercrombie fitch ad out of the clutches of this skeletal masked guy see plotless and pointless    spoiler alert    we eventually get to the land of green only to realize that it too has dried up as much as this movie and we have to endure the entire trip in reverse ugh near the end hardys character tells his adventure laden ladies that his name is max was that supposed to be a secret     bottom line    disappointing after the first 10 minutes apparently budget script rewrites and other issues plagued fury road the finished product makes that painfully obvious  rent or read snowpiercer 2013 if you want a well acted well directed apocalyptic claustrophobic statement on classvalue and humanity    the bad news    i left a half a box of snocaps next to my recliner at the theater
May 18 2015,positive,i left the theater giddy this movie is as wonderful as it is ridiculously overthetop and the characters are multidimensional and absolutely fascinating
May 18 2015,positive,after my first viewing i was blown away by the stunning visuals lack of unnecessary cheap stereotypesjokes and the nonstop adrenaline rush after the second viewing i was able to focus more on the underlying meanings symbolism and each characters emotional investment truly could be the best action film i may ever see
May 18 2015,positive,great fun movie if you dont try to make sense out of it charlize theron is great in this one exciting and visually stunning enjoy it for what it is
May 18 2015,positive,so mad max fury road is the story of max a road warrior who gets mixed up in a rescue attempt lead by a mysterious women named furiosa and has to help her as she trys to transport herself and a group of women slaves across the wasteland while being chased by a crazy warlord and his army and i am going to be straight up honest with you guys this is the best action movie ive ever scene i am being serious it really is this movie is honest to god perfect in every way the acting is incredible with just great performance all around especially from tom hardy and charlize theron the cinematography is beautiful and makes every shot look like a moving painting the action my god the action it literally made my jaw drop from beginning to end with its amazing shots of just pure chaos and destruction mixed with a incredible soundtrack making you feel as if you are actually in the movie but the thing i loved about this movie the most is the hidden messages and hidden meanings it weaved into it  the movie from the outside is a amazing action movie but on the inside it is really a deep thought provoking look inside the human mind and shows how we can all find hope even when there isnt any and this all really comes from the director george miller who was able to create this amazing work of art and in all honesty this isnt a movie its a look inside his head this is why i am giving mad max fury road a solid 1010 this movie is a masterpiece that deserves to be scene so please see this movie as soon as you can
May 18 2015,positive,george millers mad masterpiece the no 1 action flick of the decade is finally here brace yourselves director george millers brutal and cinematic whirlwind is breathtaking on a massive apocalyptic scale this film will kick your ass hard read more 
May 18 2015,positive,all that i can say is that i felt like i was watching a 25 hour metalica video from 1993 and it was amazing
May 18 2015,positive,like watching a dream   fuck
May 18 2015,negative,horrible i started to walk out but didnt want to waste the money i wasted my time instead i love action but this was beyond silly
May 18 2015,positive,everything i never knew i wanted from an action movie and then more a lot more
May 18 2015,positive,i absolutely loved this action thriller the best part is that the action is mostly practical which is a rarity in hollywood today george miller was able to reboot his series his way and he couldnt have done it better while the story can be a little clunky at times the action all but makes up for it if you love an awesome popcorn flick then this one is definitely for you if you have seen previous mad max films and didnt like them then i think its safe to say you can pass on this one because its giving you the same feel overall great movie with amazing action and acting by the 2 leads in charlize theron  tom hardy
May 18 2015,positive,the hype is real insanity and awesomeness level 9000
May 18 2015,positive,its on another level most epic movie ive seen
May 18 2015,positive,batsh insane yet full of character and amazing scenery never thought of the desert as scenery eh i really really liked this one its one of the most entertaining movies ive seen in a while and it is hard not to appreciate everything detail miller poured into this remake i honestly think it is the new standard for remakes
May 18 2015,positive,the summer season is back upon us and george miller has returned from the land of dancing penguins to the postapocalyptic world of mad max for the first time in 30 years the trailers promised us a lovely day but did mad max fury road deliver on that promise        mad max fury road is the fourth film in the mad max franchise and stars tom hardy taking over the titular role max rockatansky from mel gibson charlize theron as imperator furiosa hugh keaysbyrne as the warlord immortan joe and nicholas hoult as the warboy nux the story follows max after the conclusion of the oil wars and in the devastation of the water wars being taken prisoner by immortan joe furiosa a leader in immortan joes military takes issue with his use of women as prized breeders and breaks from military formation with joes wives stowed away in her war rig alerting joe of the mutiny strapping prisoners including max as blood bags to the hood of their cars joe and his warboys take chase of furiosa through the desert wasteland after a devastating sandstorm grants max freedom he joins with furiosa in  her attempt to find freedom from immortan joes rule    this is a movie that will stick in your memory although this movie plays as a standalone in the franchise fury road follows in the footsteps of the insanity that is george millers mad max world the visuals concepts and set pieces in this movie are strikingly unique and is a nonstop action thrill ride that franchises such as the fast and the furious and transformers only dream of being there is quite a bit of hyperbole flowing on the internet about this film and i am hesitant to add to it i loved this movie but i am not yet willing to put it in any best ever categories that being said i could not have asked for a better thrill ride in a movie theater this summer than this trip down fury road    i do want to comment on the visual effects of this movie fury road was very much minimalistic in its use of cgi effects a large majority of the effects in the film were practical and it adds a sense of realism to the film that can almost hit you on a subconscious level it may have been my imagination but at times it appeared to be filmed at either a slightly higher frame rate than normal or in some scenes in stop motion as the strings of fastedits showed everysoslightly which of course is just a nitpick but i would be curious to find out more about the technical side of the shoot    overall this was the insane summer action blockbuster that i wanted it to be i would recommend seeing this on the biggest screen possible with the best speakers possible as this is a truly immersive experience
May 18 2015,positive,an action film that actually exhausts you with its nonstop intensity beautiful cinematography and make no mistakethis isnt maxs movie this one belongs to charlizes furiosa
May 18 2015,positive,beautiful and extremely entertaining from beginning to end  hardy does and great job as max and theron went all out saw it last night and already want to see it again just in a case i missed something
May 18 2015,positive,an artistic cinematic mind bender just stunning to witness in theaters surprised it wasnt released in imax its like falling inside someones thoughts during an acid trip beautiful film lacked in story but made up in interesting characters and built a universe to inhabited in the near future cant wait for more
May 18 2015,positive,my name is max and thusly in a matrixesque trinitysaving moment of resurrection the charlize therron character comes back to life     that is not the end of the movie however and so i did not spoil the ending of this cult classic in this review it is however one thrill of a ride from start to finish no the movie which i saw in 3d did not melt my face off as one review said that it would but it did not disappoint this remake of mad max originally starring mel gibson throws explosion after explosion in the audiences face and uses makeup and some hypedup well amplified electronic rock music to great effect     there is a thread of what having a belief in some kind of postdeath glory and mindless devotion to a leader does to a person who does not think highly of oneself does not have much imagination that is these white and black figures are somewhat reminiscent of terrorists who aspire to greatness in valhalla and commit acts of violence     certainly mad max does have elements of horror which seem unwarranted or thrown in there for the sake of getting the horror rating yet the cgi and special effects especially in 3d are innovative the pacing is amplified in certain places such that the spooky figures especially in the opening sequences of mad max seem otherworldly and very spooky    i recommend this movie to the hardcore mad max cultfollowers as well as anyone who is in the mood for a very excellent action flick
May 18 2015,positive,more about her than max
May 18 2015,positive,wasnt the biggest fan but then again i went in expecting mad max this is essentially charlize therons film and her performance could carry the film competently even on its own however this is a big action film with plenty of spectacle and amazing sets the whole run time is chock full of high octane action and only once or twice does it ever stop to breathe youll be interested from start to finish and above all youll be entertained if you dont mind that the titular character only makes cameo appearances in this one youll have a blast
May 18 2015,positive,im not going to write this comparing it to the original mad max film i just dont think its worth while to do so theyre just different movies and casts get over it i will say on that note that this movie is as impressive today as the original mm was then perhaps even more so this was truly one of the most insane movie going experiences ive ever had its like a burning man cirque de soliel inverted blue man group mashup acidtrip in the best possible sense low on story complexity and script but overflowing with art camp and very intricate flawlessly executed action sequences that said there are some overthetop moments i could have done without for sure guitarguy but there was such attention to detail in almost every single frame that its almost irresistibly artful in its way theres just something really impressive here the performances are very strong considering the restraints of an almost nonexistent script and the action is simply unprecedented in this genre imo the intro scene alone of the film is so good and tight that the theatre actually broke out in a smattering of applause just for that at the end of the movie all you can do is laugh and applaud in  exhaustion trying to comprehend the unyielding bombastic action and absurdity of what the hell it was you just witnessed now you have to keep an open mind that if you only like say wes anderson films or rich scripted little art house films this is not going to be your jam in fact youre probably going to loath it but if youre like me and you have room in your world for any well executed art regardless of genre this is just not a movie to be missed trust me its much more enjoyable than your hollow runofthemill action movie
May 18 2015,positive,the popcorn action movie of the summer
May 18 2015,positive,in a few years time well look back and agree  this may be one of the best action films ever made a relentless thrill ride from start to finish  hardy is perfect as max and charlize kicks ass  visually pleasing all the while making you feel unclean covered in dirt and gasoline  what george miller envisioned and began 35yrs ago he perfects on fury road
May 18 2015,positive,finally a movie that was really worth watching and recommend to other people hands down
May 18 2015,positive,astonishing jawdropping breathtaking cinema that feels like having someone hold your eyes wide open and pour a mixture of neat rocket fuel desertchic and postnuclear perversion straight onto your optic nerve this max is much more in keeping with the first and second movies than the family friendly third and all the better for it boggle at the beauty of the paintlike cinematography laugh at the audacity of the visual spectacle rejoice at the bangon gender politics daily fail be damned but most all enjoy the nonstop blls to the wall batsh1t craziness of the adventure and praise the movie gods that there are still people out there like director george miller who must have been told a million times this couldnt and wouldnt work but went and did it anyhow and boy did he do it
May 18 2015,positive,this is by far the best movie ive seen all year if you miss this in theatres then youll forever regret it
May 18 2015,positive,this movie is incredible
May 18 2015,positive,this is what an action move should be i loved it
May 18 2015,positive,this movie is glorious its violent and the nonstop action is over the top see it in 2d because theres entirely too much going on to keep up with 3d
May 18 2015,positive,awesome easily on par with the originals a must see
May 18 2015,positive,both simple and beautifully chaotic mad max fury road hits the ground running and never stops while being a strong visual storytelling experience with nuanced kickass performances it is a pure thrill ride and one of the most impressive displays of practical action stuntwork i have ever seen
May 18 2015,positive,we obviously need more seventy year old directors george miller returns to the franchise that made him a household name to rock our world with one of the best action flicks ever if he can keep the pace up for a few more films tom hardy is signed on for four more as mad max himself we may see a fullon resurgence of the rrated blockbuster
May 18 2015,positive,mad max fury road contains relentless excitement interesting characters gorgeous cinematography and impeccable sound design    full review 
May 18 2015,positive,actionpacked and visually stunning madmaxfuryroad is a visionary film from dir george miller who utilizes a strong cast minimal dialogue and brilliant images to tell the story of women overturning an overbearing monarchy
May 18 2015,positive,best action movie ive seen in a long time
May 18 2015,positive,fury road rips through conventional action movie norms to provide a visceral experience millers choice to use practical effects pays off tenfold as the stuntmen and pyrotechnics deserve as much recognition as the perfect cast the mad max franchise is back and so far its a wild ride
May 18 2015,positive,saw this movie with the family this weekend action packed that sucks you in like a roller coaster ride  similar plot line as the original mad max movie but so much better in the cars and other vehicles  will leave you breathless
May 18 2015,negative,charlize drives a truck of girls and fight gross men to older ladies who help them fight the gross men back to where they started  i want my 2 hours back
May 18 2015,positive,unreal action from start to finish
May 18 2015,neutral,not sure why this is being hailed as a masterpiece the goodies drive somewhere being attacked for 45 mins at every turn  then turn round and go back and are attacked again poor plot  even poorer script but the effects are good   give me the original any day
May 18 2015,positive,one of the best action movies ive seen in a long time
May 18 2015,positive,beginning mad till the end max
May 18 2015,positive,absolutely amazing movie  non stop action from start to finish  absolute chaos
May 18 2015,neutral,great action no story    the story was very thin and thinned even more by having too many protagonists   was this a mad max story or a furiosa story or a nux story or a joe story    sadly it was all of them rolled into one and none of them were flushed out during this short heavy action film    the joe story a man who wants healthy children in a postapocalyptic world and the furiosa story of a woman that wants revenge for being treated like cattle   that was the real story that wasnt told  furiosa was after redemption but redemption isnt the same thing as revenge and what furiosa really wanted was revenge or at least that would have explained her motivation for being treated the way she was and why she sought to get back at joe and take the wifes with her  kill that old bastard for mistreating me and my family and anybody else that acts like they can control me just because they have all the power  great story in that  i am a long time mad max fan  mad max and road warrior are better than this film  beyond the thunderdome had the same problem as this one no story just lots of action but at least in that fim i got to see mel gibson portraying one of my favorite antiheroes  that being said there were moments of greatness in this fim and the person that put the road sequences together with smashing of cars should be commended for their great sequences and fantastic cgi  too bad that by the end of the movie i didnt care anymore
May 18 2015,negative,terriblestory line suckedacting sucked
May 18 2015,positive,this is an exceptional film and one of the first time in years i went to the theater and felt like i experienced something and didnt feel like i just saw a movie this movie feels like a true masterpiece and not the cgi filled garble we get now except their is quite a bit of cgi in this film  in short this is a great film and should be seen by all who love cinema
May 18 2015,negative,grossly over rated wait until redbox release and get free code rental  good special effects max is figuratively absent the first hour of the moive 2hrs of chase with short pit stops    charlize theron as furiosa is the most interesting character
May 18 2015,positive,after nearly 3 decades the mad max franchise roars back to life in the most epic way possible fury road joins the ranks of the godfather part ii the empire strikes back and even mad max 2 the road warrior as one of the single greatest sequels of all time with a dizzying array of spectacular action sequences ingenious editing and a amazing amount of story mad max fury road might end up being not just the best action movie of the year but also one of the best movies of 2015 definitely a lovely day indeed
May 18 2015,positive,fast fun load and mad
May 18 2015,positive,this is officially everything ive ever wanted in an action movie its gorgeous visually has a fantastic soundtrack and the fight scenescar chases are amazing and there are so many ladies generally in action films there is one lone female character amongst a sea of dudes not here it was so great to see so many different women represented in this film also they werent heavily sexually objectified and there wasnt a forced romantic subplot also if youre not aware many mens rights activists are boycotting this movie because they view it as feminist propaganda so even more of a reason to throw your money at this film
May 18 2015,positive,from the demented mind that brought us babe and babe 2 pig in the city  lets make this clear this is a movie which is basically one gargantuan car chase scene in which the main character hardly says a word in the first half and it sits at an incredible 98 on the tomatometer making it one of the best reviewed movies ever i could not help myself but to thump my feet and hands along to immortan joes mobile drum section and to be immersed in both the characters im still not even sure how they pulled this off considering how little time is taken away from the main thrust and action its a bit like black hawk down in that it is so relentless that it jettisons so many of the conventions of blockbusters and movies in general and succeeds brilliantly for it
May 18 2015,positive,incredible movie nice to see more live action and less cgi
May 18 2015,positive,george miller is 70 years old but he can still direct a film like its nobodies business as can be sampled with his latest outing mad max fury road is a return to form not just for miller but for the actionpostapocalyptic genre as well there isnt much plot here never before has a trailer so accurately depicted what a film isa big long crazy chase scene but the action and characters speak for themselves tom hardy slips into the max role effortlessly max an ex cop is one of the survivors of the apocalypse tortured by the memories of all the people he couldnt save and plagued by constant vivid hallucinations max has decided its best for everyone if he stays a lone wolf hardy sells his role pretty well staying true to the max we saw in previous films while still injecting just the right amount of his own take on the character charlize theron does a good job as imperator furiosa a mysterious character whom max ends up reluctantly teaming up with hugh keaysbyrne is quite memorable and disturbing as immortan joe the evil leader of his own tribesociety by far i found nicholas hoults nux to be the most memorable part of this film nux is one of the followers of immortan joe he believes that it is his destiny to die a glorious death so he can be welcomed into the halls of valhalla his character goes on quite the journey and i enjoyed getting to watch his character grow and change in some unexpected and cool ways the action found within this film is pretty high quality stuff most of the stunts were performed live although im pretty sure i saw a few cgi bodies being flung around at points there is a good chunk of the film where we enter a slow period but i didnt find this to be a hinderance at all mainly due to the fantastic breathtaking cinematography by john heale who also worked on harry potter and the sorcerers stone dead poets society and rain man just to name a few the world that george miller and crew created here is gorgeous and just about fully realized  a real achievement this is also some of the best use of 3d in a film ive seen recently as well there are plenty of screen penetrating moments and some fantastic depth as well really helps to suck you into the world of the film mad max fury road is a beautiful delightfully insane film
May 18 2015,positive,action action and more action this movie had me glued to the screen from beginning to end and left me wanting more in an extremely good way spectacular stunts glorious chase and combat sequences and a nononsense storyline go and see it
May 18 2015,positive,max is back this movie sets a new bar action movies a masterpiece
May 18 2015,positive,amazing visuals and incredibly unique light plot but this is overridden by the thrill of the action
May 18 2015,positive,watching fury road is in a sense like attending a gasoline soaked tea party all whilst listening to alice in chains check my brain at full volume  as the fumes start to invade your sinuses you cant help but smile from ear to ear and breathe more deeply     the reason mad max fury road is as highly rated as it is is because for thirty years there hasnt been any action film like it it roars to life with such rage and vehicular carnage that after leaving the theater theres a feeling of toxicity in your blood that you know wont leave your system until youve seen the movie again     within five minutes of starting you know everything you need to about this world that youve been plunged into and for two hours all you can do is either enjoy the ride or get off because it rarely stops probably one of the best if not the best action films ive seen in my lifetime i highly recommend mad max fury road if youre looking for something original and exhilarating this summer
May 18 2015,positive,this was great fun visually and great story telling
May 18 2015,positive,this was spectacular all the character all the carnage all the action  this movie is raw action  keep in mind that this movie has a bit of a screwed up ideastory but the execution was outstanding like the people who made this are probably a little crazy but boy did they make a fantastic film
May 18 2015,positive,the film had amazing visuals with its fragmenting explosions and awesome chase scene choreography its biggest downfall was the 9010 split between chase scenes and character interactions theres not really any character development at all would have liked to see more postapocalyptic society and a little less driving also would have liked more hand to hand combat however despite these shortcomings the movie is still highly entertaining
May 18 2015,positive,alot better than i thought it would be it was actually very good
May 18 2015,positive,it humanizes what character development it has and keeps it simple from the storytelling perspective but the centerpiece here are the action sequences beautifully done and breaking a few action cliches we see in movies today my  tiny problem with the film was the way george miller transitioned his scenes they slowed down a film a bit but does not damage the film as a whole
May 18 2015,positive,forget everything live your youth have a irresistible sense of fun
May 18 2015,positive,its been 30 years since weve gone beyond thunderdome and finally max has come back to the big screens and in his absence a lot changed in action movies  the process was slow  the heroes couldnt be hurt and cgi was replacing actual stunt work  when tarantino made death proof it wasnt necessarily his best work but it made headlines because of the real stuntsa real stuntwoman was hanging on to the hood of a car going down the road at insane speeds while being chased and rammed by another car  it was thrilling to watch  it was realas real as a movie can make it seem  if you flash back to action movies way back when they were doing all sorts of crazy stunts and car chases etc  they didnt have computer imagery to pop an actor into a computer generated car they had stunt men and carefully set up stunts movies not made in the us have been bringing stunts back but nothing like fury road  mad max  fury road is exhilerating  its fast its action packed its expertly plotted and due to the technology of today it looks beautiful  george miller could have ridden on the mad max namesake made a generic movie and called it a day  instead he made a film about redemption hope trust insanity chaos and pain  charlize theron is almost always fantastic and here as imperator furiosa she shines once again  tom hardy does a fairly good job as max but he attempts to mimic more of what mel gibson did in the past and what works for gibson doesnt necessarily work for everyone else  he does a fine job but the voice doesnt match him and at times i thought the sound wasnt synced correctly to his character  mad max fury road is fucking crazy  if you thought the villains were insane in the other films you havent seen anything yet whats great about fury road beyond the action beyond the stunts beyond the actors is the attention to detail  every character every car every person on screen is so decked out in garb and or make up they look chaotic and they look real  from george miller the mind that brought us the original mad max trilogy babe and happy feetcomes the next chapter in the now mad max saga and it is bloody brilliant oh and about those stuntsmost of the film is all stunt work one of the only scenes thats notis the sandstorm  so when they show you from the sky all of the cars descending down upon the war truck that max and imperiosa are onthats realand the jumping from truck to car the explosions the swinging poles the grappling hooks etcall of that is real  go see mad max if theres one film that deserves to be called bad ass it is fury road
May 18 2015,positive,george miller delivered a great movie welcome back max
May 18 2015,positive,forget everything live your youth have a irresistible sense of fun
May 18 2015,negative,really i was very disappointed especially since others had been generous in their ratings
May 18 2015,negative,this is a terrible movie  poor acting way too many attempts to do the quirky filming of the original  dont waste a movie ticket
May 18 2015,positive,barely any brains but a whole lot of beauty this narratively handicapped eyeandearcandy also falters on characterization and dialogue heft
May 18 2015,positive,mad max fury road is one rare film these days that makes us glued to the theatre screen rather than our mobile screen   120 minutes of pure adrenaline rush action   you may call it even a feminist action movie   it does what its supposed to do with all the honesty and style  entertainment 
May 18 2015,positive,a pure surge of adrenaline that action films desperately needed director george miller has crafted a chaotic work of art its a film that relies on practical effects and stunts 85 of the time unlike other summer blockbustersand it shows beautifully among all the chaos lies expertly crafted cinematography showing wide shots of hectic action rarely does it resort to the shakycam way the visual smorgasbord is complimented by totally ridiculous characters that feel ripped straight from a comic book go watch this in theaters
May 18 2015,positive,2 hours of pure adrenaline that you cant look away from and wont want to
May 18 2015,positive,not the thrill ride critics would have you believe it is one great chase and two ok ones doesnt make a great action movie boring in between those moments some of the vehicles look cool though
May 18 2015,positive,this is the best action film in years its real gritty flinchinducing fun visually every shot is art when it was over i wanted to immediately watch it again
May 18 2015,positive,friggin amazing nonstop action absolute crazy movie loved it
May 18 2015,positive,a face melting wild ride see it on the big screen
May 18 2015,positive,insane action  there were moments after certain action sequences where the audience collectively exhaled in unison before breaking out in applause  fantastic
May 18 2015,negative,it was ok  i dont get the 90 rating from rotten  actors were ok but the whole plot was not worth a great rating imo  a day after i watched it i couldnt understand why they made it  no different than what nolan did with the batman movies  in the end he got way too fancy with a plot that made no sense his version sucks
May 18 2015,positive,perhaps the greatest aspect of mad max is that it could have been a bythebooks cashin on a familiar name but instead has become the most artistic action film to come out of this decade this film strives to be be different from the competition and does so in a grandiose fashion the characters and lore within the world of mad max are unique enough to stand out but remain grounded in an ounce of realism this coupled with amazingly choreographed action sequences makes mad max a welcome addition to the foray of action flicks see this movie once for the explosions again to find the allusions to modern society and once more for the explosions time to take notes hollywood this is an action film done right
May 18 2015,positive,fantastic the movie isnt even about max and it manages to still be awesome
May 18 2015,negative,how can this movie score this high its waterworld on sand and waterworld had more substance thats saying a lot rough acting and dialogue its one big explosion shot in hd have our attention spans shortened this much shallow and vague plot lines apparently there is a fuel war going on but you wouldnt know it because everyone on gods sand yellow earth goes through 50 gallons in less than a minute the obscene rating of this movie by critics and the public dilutes true craftsmanship of movie making and product this can only be explained by taking a look at the quality of movies this year maybe this movie is the firecracker at a funeral but that still is not a reason to lift this movie up so high
May 18 2015,positive,review by jesse burleson of views on film      in the mid1980s mad max 2 the road warrior represented the first time i ever saw a movie on vhs no joke there i was taking in the existential catastrophic splendor and thrusted into a funky eclectic world that only director george miller could deposit me in i was also taken aback by the aura of star mel gibson he didnt say much he just drove the big rig and gave any punk rocker delinquent the business via a veritable sawedoff shotgun when the announcement that a new installment was on the horizon some thirty years later it was also predicated on the fact that australias favorite son be omitted from the lead role brit tom hardy who seems to be everywhere these days got to inhabit the drivers seat haha the question on every moviegoers mind is can he fill the shoes of mad mel the answer is it doesnt matter mad max fury road isnt entirely about the character of max rockatansky and hardy for what its worth only possesses about a smidgen of melle mels ear to the grindstone screen presence for practical purposes though hell do and so will the movie its plot is slight yet there are action sequences providing enough scorched antics and kinetic motion to make your eyes shoot through the back of your head were talking apocalypse now more than ever    historically george miller has been in charge of every mad max movie since their franchised inception back in 1979 he takes everything that made those films work and ratchets it up a few more notches here his world in fury road is made up of caricatures that for the most part are funkier nastier and much more repugnant this is imagination outside five boxes the look is more modern too cinematographer john seale he shot the tourist harbors a canvas that is ablaze drenched and vehemently dusty its like a sunburn that eventually turns golden brown as for storytelling sensibilities well they are fashioned less than in all three of the previous outings combined the script is the product of more than one writer and you think to yourself did it need that many in truth theres not a whole lot of dialogue anyway and i suppose whatever amount is messaged to the audience well it probably comes off as concealed no matter i honestly dont go to mad max movies for the account i want to view what roger daltrey sang about that would be the tune by the who called lets see action granted this 2015 release has enough pyrotechnics villainy and aerodynamic exertion for ten movies with what seems like almost no cgi i hope the stuntmen got paid handsomely because they work some serious overtime    now the last thirty minutes of mad max fury road are a masterpiece all in itself they make the flick better than it really is or even has a right to be you gotta use your utmost imagination or just think raiders of the lost ark on anabolic steroids what precludes is an extended chase sequence with enough semi trucks and other motorized vehicles to overrun the city of detroit there is violence in nature here and acrobatic candour that simply wears you out    so who is this all attributed to well director george miller of course and at age 70 he is one feisty fellow this dude is like the martin scorsese of action directors because of his starryeyed energy thats blatantly possessed he hadnt made a mad max film since 1985 so you know that he had a lot of time to subjugate his newest vision my thinking is that he might have checked out 1995s waterworld to mirror the costume design or to polish things up a bit or even to add some new angles there are shots in fury road where the villainous malefactors are off in the distance and you know that danger is coming it reminded me of said film so sue me his premise is in short doses and it intervenes between periods of metalgeared rubble and heavy metal stage prog    you have of course max tom hardy hes an australian prisoner and a man whos held captive while being used for upside down blood donation then theres imperator furiosa played by charlize theron in the token female badass role shes a war rig driver who is helping five wives escape from breeding slavery finally we have nux played by nicolas hoult who reminded me of the gyro captain from the road warrior hes a sick war boy and needs a large amount of ichor to go on surviving thats all im gonna reveal just know that all of these soupedup characters are in some way connected now your job is to buy a ticket get strapped in and let the chaos and upheaval simply spill onto the screen    in conclusion this film has garnered four stars from many of the nations critics i myself enjoyed it but im scratching my head to figure where all the enormous praise came from heres how i chalked up my rating i gave mad max fury road three and a half stars for the audacious relentless suspense and two and a half stars for the razor thin narrative that results in a solid dose of actionadventure fare but not something thats catered to magnum opus territory regardless this is still a road worth taking there are no exits no stop lights and the aspect of no passing lanes is irrelevant to quote nicolas hoults albino crackedlipped nux what a day what a lovely day natch
May 18 2015,positive,i had no idea what was going on and it was amazing
May 18 2015,positive,non stop action from start to finish well done movie
May 18 2015,positive,gleefully insane love the cars the soundtrack the strong female characters the weirdness the aussinessthe real stunts cgi is minimum it just fucking kicks ass
May 18 2015,positive,a grand symphony of breathtaking insanity   not your standard cookie cutter flick that we see a dime a dozen these days  i loved this flick and cant wait to go back for a second helping
May 18 2015,negative,dont believe the hype
May 18 2015,negative,true to the original well filmed but dumb story boring
May 18 2015,positive,one of the wildest strangest colorful explosive i cant understand some of what they are saying movies ive seen in a long time  when you bring in two quality actors like charlize theron and tom hardy and bring tons of craziness you get one of the wildest movies ive ever seen in mad max fury road  i mean im not sure i get the point of the whole dang movie but who cares  i thought what fast and furious 7 did with cars was impressive but mad max goes another step further  its simply crazy with the look of the different characters and how while being serious about its action never takes itself too seriously  only thing i think it lacked was some humor in places but this is my surprise of the summer really
May 18 2015,positive,few action films will ever top this a high octane feast of nihilistic imagery explosions superb performances and social commentary see it now
May 18 2015,positive,went to go watch this movie in 3d it was good but there are spots in the movie i felt they could of put more effort into overall a total guy film
May 18 2015,positive,great action  only problem is its story
May 18 2015,negative,i will be out of group but reallythe first 30 minutes the dialog is absurd well i will keep the old ones
May 18 2015,positive,definitely weird but so worth
May 18 2015,positive,very good movie and story plot
May 18 2015,positive,simply stunning in visuals pace dialogue campiness id watch this over and over again
May 18 2015,positive,an ok story line that could have used a little further information to help guide audiences considering how long it has been since a mad max movie has been made
May 18 2015,negative,i can appreciate the craft of this flick but the high scores are way overblown and really misleading  maybe ive just gotten to the age where i want more than three centimeters of story in a spectacle this large  im also biased because i dont love car chase sequences and those of you whove seen it already know that this is basically a two hour car chase sequence
May 18 2015,positive,a completely berserk bizarre action extravaganza that is purely original in almost every way and who would have expected a modern feminist undertone in a post apocalyptic wasteland  i dont think ive ever seen anything like this
May 18 2015,positive,insane  best action movie ive ever seen and ill see it again soon for sure
May 18 2015,positive,wow these days with too much cg this movie delivers true action with nothing holding back there are some amazing sequences and ive seen lot of action movies my hats go out to both charlize and tom for making this into more than just action movie
May 18 2015,positive,this movie is punk rock
May 18 2015,negative,i must be the 1 because this movie was so awful that for the first time in my life i got up and walked out of it and requested a refund which i received if you want to watch a car chase over and over again for 2 hours all you have to do is turn on the news dont waste your time
May 18 2015,positive,in and of itself this is a perfect film  some of the best if not the best cinematography ive ever seen
May 18 2015,positive,a perfect action film enough said
May 18 2015,positive,visuals were absolutely lights out cast was great but theron steals the show not since the first aliens has a female hero shined like furiosa theron did
May 18 2015,positive,mad max fury road is a weird stylish weird actionpacked weird cool movie there are so many great performances in this film tom hardy continues to be awesome charlize theron also turned in a powerful performance along with nicholas hoult hugh keaysbyrne back from the original mad max and possibly the stealer of the show iota as the doof warroir aka the guitar guy but one of my absolute favorite thing about this movie was the wonderful mix of practical effects with cg there is something special about actual ridiculously designed cars getting torn to bits and exploded in the most glorious fireballs and seeing that mixed with a beautifully rendered sandstorm director george miller proves that he hasnt lost a step by creating one of the best examples of how to return to a dormant franchise in epic fashion fury road is a movie that reminds me why i love the cinema it is a completely unique experience that is unlike anything that has come out of hollywood in years

May 18 2015,positive,brilliant madness i loved it and i think id watch furiosa do her taxes she was that awesome

May 18 2015,positive,this is what summer movies should be like fun with substance   this is a true masterpiece and excellent action movie  this is not transformers this is not fast  furious this is a vey well made action film  this is a very simple but powerful story about redemption and freedom   the script is very well written  the editing is excellent the music is outstanding  the action is absolutely fantastic real action and real stunts you really feel like you are watching real action and real people not some cgi crap transformers fast  furious  george miller proves that action films do not need to be filled with cgi he directs action in a way that makes you at the edge of your seat but the man is not just about action the way he directs his actors shows how much he cares about his work  everyone gave great performances  tom hardy is great as always nicholas hoult is really good even rosie huntington gave an excellent performance but charlize theron steals every scene shes in this is the best performance i have ever seen for her  i cant recommend this movie enough this film  last years edge of tomorrow are the best action films  i have seen in a very long time  this film should be seen in theatres not on a laptop screen support filmmakers who make good films that actually mean something 55
May 18 2015,neutral,big on action short on plot
May 18 2015,positive,amazing and exhilarating a roller coaster ride full of thrills and perfectly timed moments that make you deviously smile to yourself and nodenjoying the pure chaotic beauty of this masterpiece bravo mr miller
May 18 2015,positive,great job  an awesome b movie  fun to watch 
May 18 2015,positive,craziest best film you will see this year miller nailed it
May 18 2015,positive,absolutely adrenalinerushing movie with epic direction
May 18 2015,negative,max is a sidekick in his own movie action is good but women he contributes to saving are hard to like i think i would have liked it better if it were a stand alone movie and not a mad max film where they turn a great action character into robin
May 18 2015,positive,so happy to see a great action movie to kick off the summer movie season
May 18 2015,positive,what a fun movie dont come to the theatre looking for some long lasting redeeming value cuz you aint leaving with it it was fun wall to wall excitement it was hard to pick a break in the action to go to the bathroom so dont get a soda that is way to large for a medium drink and a small popcorn for over 1200 its a bit strange that the characters are constantly dirty and extremely strange but what did you expect it was fun
May 18 2015,positive,qm plm sa nuti plak fury road bha gandeste in plm inainte sa zici asta
May 18 2015,positive,one of the greatest fucking insane movie ever  what a lovely day no watch you rugi it will melt your face off
May 18 2015,positive,as in previous mad max movies the dialog is sparse we learn about the characters through their actions the movie was spectacular  big scenes big scenery big effects and big bold moves  furiousa was a superhero but nux stole all the redemption
May 18 2015,positive,original beautiful a breathe of fresh air went into this movie knowing nothing about it left the theater being in complete shock more movies need to be like this one
May 18 2015,positive,straight out bonkers petrol head driven movie the plot is not that different from the earlier films just driving around in real vehicles doing insanely stupid stunts in the desert it does look great on the screen but story wise it just a retread you could just watch the dakar rally and probably find a better plot still if you like watching a bunch of lunatics barrelling around and shooting each other then job done silly bonkers daft as a brush nonsense that trundles across the screen fun but dont engage the gears in your brain
May 18 2015,negative,this wasnt mad max it was mad maxine as she was the lead role  95 battle scenes with very little story or dialog ill bet that actors didnt have to work very hard to remember there little lines they had this movie provided no way for anyone that doesnt already know the story to know who mad max is and why is he the way he is he was clearly not the primary character in this movie this movie was a pathetic attempt to redo the story  all i wanted to do was to walk out of the theater not sure how i made it through this piece of garbage
May 18 2015,positive,is the best post apocaliptic movie i ever seen
May 18 2015,positive,walltowall action that does not rely too heavily on computer effects the lack of story is made up for with a fully realized world and oldschool action
May 18 2015,negative,great visual effects but mostly a mindless couple of hours with an uninteresting plot
May 18 2015,positive,wow  non stop action i love this movie gonna see it again this weekend
May 18 2015,positive,this film is simply and purely the best action movie of the decade george miller has set the standards of brutal epic action in the 80s and comes back in 2015 to remind all those hollywood blockbuster makers how it should be done  the only problem is that after watching mad max fury road you wont enjoy the next action films as before george raised the bar too high this film has already written cinema history as one of the game changing action masterpieces period
May 18 2015,positive,such fun over the top and thrilling eye candy    just what i want in an action movie  i can rent pitch perfect 2
May 18 2015,positive,this is a masterpiece of film making george miller has reinvented and remythologised the mad max legacy with a thunderous awe of surprise suspense and visual excitement that is unrelenting from first minute to last george miller has will reintroduced the apocalypse movies of the 70s and 80s to a whole new audience and for that alone needs to receive full credit with his writing staff for producing one of the best movies ever made in this genre     mad max fury roads world is enriched by a complex narrative around survival environmental destruction power and control the investment of my attention commenced immediately in the characters individual and collective journey through the story i was pleasantly surprised to see that imperator furiosa charlize theron has equal movie time and focus as the character of mad max tom hardy indeed for me charlize steals the show and gives the movie the credibility it deserves mad maxs character on the other hand is raw unrefined and in a way underdeveloped tom hardy is a great actor but he appears to be restrained purposefully so mad maxs presence is evident throughout the entire film but there is something lacking it would be premature to compare tom hardys version of mad max to mel gibsons as we need to see where george miller will take the character next i cannot wait    the other credit that needs to be given to george miller is in the insane direction he would have had to be required on a shoot that looks mad as it feels impressive to say the least is that the world is fully realised without the use of cgi and in this regard the movie works brilliantly the crazy car designs the weapons of war the tribal quality of the warriors lend a credibility to the world that cgi never could i take my hat off to the cast and crew that produced the vehicles and performed these stunts i hope they receive all the recognition they deserve in the upcoming award seasons    george miller cast and crew thank you for reminding of the power of the visual narrative story i will be seeing this again again again and again well done
May 18 2015,positive,pretty fucking sick movie definitely not one for the ladies
May 18 2015,negative,r all the reviews on this paid for  couldnt wait for this movie to end had no connection to characters story line was ridiculous and action was repetitive seriously i want a new app that gives real reviews because i dont believe it was a 92 like from audience theatre i was in all left shocked that we paid and sat through such a waste of time
May 18 2015,positive,astonishing non stop action for two hours with a score that is unmatched in any movie as well put together as this one was if you get to see it make sure its imax or 3d you wont be disappointed
May 18 2015,positive,walked in unknowing of the greatness of this movie
May 18 2015,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed its bad assness powerful in all sense including the tonecolor of the film and the trucks and musical accompaniment
May 18 2015,positive,really a master piece miller did it againg
May 18 2015,negative,this movie was awful  pales in comparison to the original mad max or the road warrior  two hours of no plot a max who is not even the star villians that nobody cares about and not to mention a truck carrying a guitar player and a drum corps played by irradiated people  if this is the direction movies is heading we dont have much to look forward to in the future  if you a 12 year old boy this movie might be for you  otherwise stay away
May 18 2015,positive,the road warrior returns to our screens after 30 years this time played by tom hardy but still directed by the original creator george miller  one wordâmental  this is a pure adrenaline rush from start to finish as its basically one long chase scene across barren wastelands of the postapocalyptic future  its fast and furious meets whacky races  but furiouser and whackier than both  the vehicular destruction and effects are mindblowing all the more thanks to predominantly real stunts and the designs of the soupedup death machines are awesome  in fact the whole mad max world is oozing with detail from the freaky âhalflifeâ inhabitants to the excellent cinematography and of course those crazy cars  the plot is simple and thatâtms entirely the point but amongst the mayhem there is gravitas thanks to the richly designed world  the acting is decent with much of the plaudits going to charlize theron who goes toetotoe with max in the badass department  however i was a tad disappointed with max himself  not in hardyâtms performance heâtms good enough as a man of few words but in that we donâtmt really get to know him due to his stoic nature  as a result he comes across a bit two dimensional and dare i say a bit dull at times  with no real emotional investment the explosive action doesnâtmt resonate or have the impact it could have done  itâtms still amazing and i absolutely loved it but because of that it has to get marked down slightly
May 18 2015,positive,what other movie can you see a guy playing guitar on a truck shooting flames out of the neck of the guitar cant really get that anywhere else
May 18 2015,positive,a lot of fun despite the shitty plot it is what it is a great big fun shoot em up full of explosions and crazy stunts some amusing cameos too
May 18 2015,positive,i thought it lived up to the hype feels like george miller had two decades worth of cool ideas about how a new mad max film would look stored in his head and really hit the gas when he got the funds the action is relentless but its executed so well that theres no sense of tedium  perhaps due partly to clever thinking about how the vehicles can be used modified and destroyed on the road tom hardys good charlize therons great the script isnt exactly a tome of dialogue but it it tells you whats going on pretty succinctly and has the odd profound gem about postapoc life im definitely hanging out for the sequels but the bars been raised very very high
May 18 2015,positive,one of the best action movies ive ever seen beautifully shoot and with a sound track that beats diegetically throughout fury road is a nonstop rollercoaster ride of petrolheads and crazy characters
May 18 2015,positive,this years growing anticipation and buzz surrounding writerdirector george millers return to lead the fourth installment of his mad max series has been palpable and on a level only attained by one other 2015 cult classicthis decembers release of star wars episode vii  the force awakens in fact many might argue that millers mad max fury road dwarfs jj abrams the force awakens since its been 30 years since max rockatansky roamed the australian postapocalypse outback desert on film    mad max fury road begins with one of the best opening sequences of any movie so far in 2015 after a quick although too short narration by tom hardy as mad max an allout suspense thriller ensues for the next fifteen minutes during this time were introduced to the roving band of marauders sporting a guitar lead and one renegade fighter named imperator furiosa played convincingly by charlize theron similar to other strong female rebels found in the mad max movie collection viewers will have to determine if therons furiosa is a good character or an evil one beyond the films exciting start lies continuous battle scenes that become so repetitive and numbing to the eyes only younger igeneration mad max fans and transformers filmmaker michael bay will applaud    aside from its impressive choreography and cinematography throughout the film fury road lacks a compelling understood story viewers are given plenty of sand skirmishes and scantily clad concubines to follow but no backstory on max rockatanskythe former australian patrol officer who goes mad after seeing his family killed by gang members during societys breakdown in the 1979 original movie    this is maxs story to tell yet hardy rarely strings more than 2 or 3 words together at a time the lack of dialogue in fury road becomes noticeable to viewers and takes focus away from maxs background story as well as his current predicament no explanation or character development is offered on therons sparkplug furiosa either    fury road is merely the placeholder for the next george miller endeavormad max furiosawhich has already completed filming as weve seen from the likes of the marvel comic series or even last years the hunger games mockingjay part 1 studios are making movies for the sole purpose of setting up their next film sometimes an incomplete movie is used to generate a need to see the next one this tactic leaves movie goers with questions as to what they just saw but knowing the answers and true understanding can only to be found in the following film coming down the pike which according to tom hardy in recent press reports will include his appearance in three more george miller mad max films in our future lets hope the lingering questions and character development omitted in fury road get addressed in mad max furiosa this spectacular franchise and its increasing fan base deserve it    grade c    read more reviews by patrick at 
May 18 2015,positive,an absolutely bonkers film that paints a riveting picture of a postapocalyptic future with minimal brushstrokes there is so little dialogue it could almost be a silent film and yet it conveys so much more than just action basically a twohour car chase filled with fantastic cinematography brilliant practical special effects and sheer lunacy probably my  favorite action movie since kill bill
May 18 2015,positive,this took me back to the bold school mad max movies what a great movie hope to see another trilogy
May 18 2015,positive,a damn near perfect film with enough originality explosions  and badass vehicles to leave you anxious for the the next one
May 18 2015,negative,story or what little of one there was sucked lets escape no we need to go back special effects were cool but thats about it
May 18 2015,positive,i was expecting more it can be seen without 3 d too few amusing and funny instances  scenes kept me going
May 18 2015,positive,great nonstop action from the opening to the close  arguably the best mad max movie although i havent seen the gibson ones in a while but theres no way they were as exciting as this not saying i didnt like the others  a great surprise for the beginning of the summer
May 18 2015,positive,i didnt think george miller made the masterpiece again
May 18 2015,positive,easily the best movie i have seen in years a movie that is straightup in your face action with so much subtlety that every detail of the story could be clearly understood
May 18 2015,positive,ok what just happened to me i just finished watching mad max thats what     disclaimer when ordering tickets make sure you pronounce fury road as in nick fury from avengers and not fury as in wow this puppy is really fury you will get zero laughs and make an enemy for life    ive never seen the mel gibson version as they are recognised as pants and mel gibson is a one man reich     but have you ever watched a car chase and been like man i hope this lasts two and half more hours because if you did they boy have i got s film for you    mad max is played out in a future ravaged by nuclear war and only australians and english people have survived in the sand but its not a fun beach party weird old skeletor man and his baby with a beard yep have all the water and wont give it all to the poor people as he intends to keep it along with all of the breast milk he can bottle admittedly a business idea i once had when chemically intoxicated     max is captured becauseinsert reason here and is emotionally finger blasted into sadness and turned into an unwilling blood donor bit of shady move max people need blood     so charlize theron steals a massive tanker full of petrol and brides yep brides and runs away she is then chased by skeletor and minions including a very dry looking nicholas hoult with ol max strapped to the front of his car max becomes the titular mad at this situation and escapes and nicks the big truck and drives off with brides and fuel     the rest of the film is a massive chase across the sandy lands very reminiscent of stop the pigeon except the pigeon is a giant tanker of fuel and betrothed ladies driven by irate maximillion i believe this wouldve been too long a title for a saturday cartoon     all of the actors in this were superb all very weird from the old granny lesbian colony all the way to ol grump max himself theres even one lady who constantly shows nipples through her shirt for the whole movie no one is kind enough in this desolate world to give her a heads up though     i would recommend this film to anyone who would like to try a big bag of cocaine without actually doing drugs solid and so much fun
May 18 2015,neutral,lots of road action and effects very entertaining if you like that sort of thing needed more plot characterrelations development and more situations not involving road battles but is called road warrior id say try it out
May 18 2015,positive,the cinematography was great however the character of max seemed almost an afterthought i felt that all the secondary characters had the lead roles at times it seemed as if max was just a bystander or observer personally i liked beyond the thunderdome better
May 18 2015,positive,a big entertaining adrenalinrush of a car chase with the purpose of saving a bunch of models props for the attention to detail and the creation of the post apocalyptic world in which all this happens could be appealing to women as it kind of has attached feminist messages to it no complex story just pure action thats about it
May 18 2015,positive,plot was well done with a lot of action which usually is a must see which this movie is especially if you liked the first 3 films
May 18 2015,positive,weird as hell kinda overhyped but good anyway
May 18 2015,positive,believe the hype  an action masterpiece
May 18 2015,positive,mad max is back motherfuckers  this is what i felt watching this
May 18 2015,positive,what a glorious film
May 18 2015,positive,even though the story is mediocre its the setting the characters and the action that make this movie exhilarating
May 18 2015,positive,a monstrous brutal thrilling visceral ride thats overthetop in a good way it delivers like a punch to the gut and does not let up its pure maxalmost nothing but road fighting but by golly its enough the part is perfect for hardy because theres not much talking but hardy is not perfect for the rolei think it needed someone with a bit more charisma nevertheless its great
May 18 2015,positive,up until the end of the sandstorm i was ready to just write holy fuck here give it 910 and leave it at that unfortunately it sags pretty heavily in the middle to the point of boredom honestly and also what the hell was with hoults character arc that was supremely dumb and unconvincing but oh well it picks up again once the convoy turns around and nothing could ruin that first stretch from the beginning to the sandstorm some of the greatest filmmaking ive seen in a long time action or otherwise
May 18 2015,positive,testosteron pumping p
May 18 2015,positive,the mad vision of a full throttle heavy metal future from the original postapocalyptic trilogy remade with modern blockbuster size and style epic
May 18 2015,positive,action and adventure all the way with a sprinkling of pure bonkers
May 18 2015,positive,thrill ride from start to finish  old school film making at its best
May 18 2015,positive,there was a plot but honestly it could have been cut as its just about the cinematography and action stars over the board of the crew as for camera color audio editor etc not sure im on board w the new max but maybe its because there is so little heard from him its hard to get a feel of anything other then odd flashbacks def worth a theater viewing but will get the blu ray for the features when out
May 18 2015,positive,mad max fury road takes what should just be one of the best summer action movies and adds a layer of depth to it this is a film people need to see multiple times
May 18 2015,positive,an absolute perfect action film from opening credits until the very last seconds idk who in their right mind could dislike this movie 
May 18 2015,positive,there is definitely no good time to get up and use the restroom in this movie be prepared for a 2 hour rollercoaster with no brakes or breaks
May 18 2015,positive,i gave the same rating to avengers because super heroes however hands down this movie was so much better
May 18 2015,positive,i think i have to watch this again to double check if it deserves that last half star but bloody hell this was a powerful action flick
May 18 2015,positive,full of slr5000 awesomeness bro more nitrous than a petrolhead could ever dream of   see it in 2d vmax
May 18 2015,positive,best movie of the summer maybe of the year charlize thereon deserves an oscar nomination tom hardy is perfect as usual

May 18 2015,positive,tom hardy owned mad max
May 18 2015,negative,a twohour car chase  a nicely done twohour chase but still   difficult to fathom all of the fivestar reviews  the stupidification of americans seems to have succeeded
May 18 2015,positive,barely stops for breath in its two hour running time this is filmmaking at its most dangerous  stripped bare plotting very little dialogue but overflowing with startling imagery and vehicular carnage
May 18 2015,positive,very good movie 3d not necessary incredible action cool story and nudity too check this one out youll love it
May 18 2015,positive,only one word to say  mindblowing
May 18 2015,positive,best mad max ever seems each sequal gets better and better good story as well tons of action and another good ending hope they come out with another sequal tom hardy played a good part and charlize theron was badass its a gotta see again movie way to go george miller lets have another
May 18 2015,positive,iv seen it twice now
May 18 2015,positive,best movie ever great exhilarating amazing perfect 10 one hell of a ride
May 18 2015,positive,if youre a mad max vet this film is for you    this film basically uses the best elements from its previous entries and puts them into a full scale action sequence    fury road is unapologetic surreal and awesome everything that could have had real potential in beyond thunderdome is here without the sillyness and hollywood grandeur it still keeps its charms of mad max and the road warrior with a symphony of violent and beautiful sequences hell its hard to call them individual sequences when the movie is constantly in motion almost at all times    charlize theron and max entertain excite and wont bore you with societal semantics or reasoning they wont talk too much and destroy the violent fanfare this movie is if youre invested in the franchise and love the primarily nonverbal experience youll love this film hell nicholas hoult and the fleeing wives provide plenty for visual and emotional heft with the limited amount of actual time to revel in it    go watch it skip furious 7
May 18 2015,positive,everything that you think wouldnt work about mad max fury road simply does filmed in a desert for 2 hours sound colourless and dull nope packed with stunning visuals and never a sleepy moment mad max not having enough dialogue to be interesting the films excellent direction and editing does all the work for him in developing his character theron stealing the show too much oh who cares she was incredible as furiosa and earned the show this is the strongest action film of this year by a long shot and arguably this decade and perhaps even this century dont miss it
May 18 2015,positive,this is a good action film but perhaps i have seen too many recently most of the story and meaning lay outside the dialogue but there was not enough meaning in it for me
May 18 2015,positive,100 action must watch
May 18 2015,positive,hands down the best action movie i have seen in years visually spectacular as well
May 18 2015,positive,best action movie in this year
May 18 2015,positive,oh what a day what a lovely day    director george millar returns over 30 years later to add a new story to his original mad max trilogy but this sequel fitting right in with all the previous entries pushes the already full throttle franchise to nearbiblical proportions mad max fury road is an epic race of humanity versus the utterly insane and it is stunningly beautiful a visual feast indeed every aspect of it is over the top fun from its color palette to its extreme costume and mechanical styling this is definitely a modern day opera    the landscape is empty and bleak like a blank orange canvas being splattered with white zombie torsos and spiked hedgehog cars ive never actually wanted to be inside of a dust storm until now i have never wanted dirt in my mouth as much as i did watching this movie to be in the thick of all the parched craziness its a testament to the visual designers of this film that such extremely hot and dry conditions look gorgeously appealing    as the dust kicks up and the action starts fury road will not let you forget that this franchise is best known for its car chase scenes if youre a car person this movie will absolutely make you lose your mind but if youre not a car person well this movie will still make you lose your mind the high octane high speed action here is unreal its all just absurd in the best possible way these scenes are so engrossing that they sweep you right into them and just when you think it couldnt possibly push any further it does this is like watching gods fight which is fitting as the film has an overall mythological feel to it by the time the very first car chase scene ends youve already been taken on several loops and thrown to the ground left to ask yourself what did i just watch and thats just the first one all while fully establishing our main characters    the cast is absolutely on point tom hardy as max rockatansky is a great succession to mel gibson quiet and strong but still growing madder and madder after all these years on his never ending odyssey nicholas hoult is quite inspired as nux hes feral and tasty both sour and sweet the true strength of the films characters though comes in a different form    the women of fury road are more than just pretty faces in fact they are extremely important to the survival of anyone in this film they are mothers wives daughters and sisters they plant the seeds of life they offer the milk of growth and strength they release the waters to replenish they are goddesses the core group of women here whose perfect supermodel bodies are covered in only wispy pure white cloth are furies not to be reckoned with they are sirens and they are oracles and they will certainly be the end of you    charlize therons imperator furiosa is the leader these women need shes ruthless and does want needs to be done to get the job done at the same time shes haunted and not without heart shes the female equivalent of max himself only better even max realizes he wouldnt make it without her and it is a wonder to watch these two work together    they are aided by junkie xls down right dirty score it sounds grimy and savage in itself with a harsh drum line and textured electronics if you could get the musical equivalent of rust brushing against itself in an epic thematic score this is pretty much it    it doesnt get much better than this as far as action flicks go this is george millers masterpiece with all the high profile movies coming out in the remainder of this year im already calling mad max fury road my movie of the year i would be thoroughly surprised to see any other sequel or remake coming have this much style originality and symbolism ingrained into such strong characters    his name is max and his movie is brilliant
May 18 2015,positive,in one word awesome the best action film in a decade
May 18 2015,positive,this was a pleasant surprise for me i wasnt the least bit impressed by the trailers and thought they looked very stupid i suppose i went into this film with extremely low expectations and that helped    i was riveted from the opening shot till the end this is such a strange and perverse universe george miller has crafted and yet you could see how everything seems rather logical if viewed totally from the confines of this perverse universe that miller has crafted therein lies the beauty of this film for me     and it was surprisingly entertaining nice tension that built up over the film with barely any dialogue the films dynamics are formed from the intense action sequences and the relationships explored through the actions of the protagonists and antagonists here miller shows us that films should show and not tell though this is taken to an extreme in his movie     this scenes in this movie are beautifully crafted even though most scenes are shot in the desert the editing choice of shots the lighting and the soundtrack all work to make this outing of mad max work be prepared to be entertained
May 18 2015,positive,what a lovely day indeed this movie is nothing short of spectacular and will go down in film history
May 17 2015,positive,this is one ride you wont want to end after the killer intro youre on a nonstop thrill ride through one of the most unique and iconic settings in cinema history the movie doesnt spend a lot of time fleshing out the individual characters and their backstories instead it focuses on introducing us to the world in which they live this movie has a style all its own and it doesnt sacrifice anything to throw off its groove this is a must see for moviegoers
May 17 2015,positive,grand in spectacle and thrills loose in narrative heft and strong emotional attachment fury road lives up to its insane marketing campaign and is doesnt slow down until perhaps the last five minutes of the picture
May 17 2015,positive,i hate this kind of action but the symbolism is quite strong   the plot is not great some concepts are pushed to the limit in a bad way but you have to recognize their bravery in executing something like this
May 17 2015,positive,lyrical mayhem and unreal sets which no one seems to be mentioning great fun and a visual palette all its own and the 3d was all the better go
May 17 2015,positive,from the moment mad max fury road the white knuckle ride to hell and back commences and it never lets up for a second an obvious parody of the islamic state death cult the soldiers are promised valhalla when they die and fast cars while they live the best looking females are used for breeding purposes and the peasants are deprived of all but the bare necessities poor old max is a captive from the start and apparently used as a blood bank while imperator furiosa played admirably by charlize theron appears to be queen bee amongst the local heroes and assorted psychos i suppose the plotline matters little but suffice it to say their are goodies and baddies and various shades of grey who all enhance the action the special effects are fantastic and the circus soleil style theatrics are simply spectacular what dialogue there is can hardly be heard but that really doesnt matter much because shakespeare it aint certainly like nothing else i have ever seen although tom hardy one of my favourite actors who was brilliant in the drop merely has to flex his muscles and look very pissed off to be the perfect max
May 17 2015,positive,spectacular one of the greatest films i have ever seen the movie also has a surprising amount of emotional heft i actually got a little misty eyed a few times go see it
May 17 2015,positive,oscar winner mark my words
May 17 2015,positive,mad max fury road is an immensely exhilarating and intense blockbuster action flick that provides all the visuals and stunts the summer movie crowd comes to expect from a film of this nature full review here 
May 17 2015,negative,ok went to see the new mad max movie tonight since rotten tomatoes gave it a 98 i loved mel gibson stallone chuck norris bruce willis movies in the 80s probably seen every single one of them i must be getting old this was similar to the road warrior but at least that one had a semblance of a plot this movie was absolute crap mad max wasnt even the star in this charlize therons character was he barely even spoke he made rocky seem like an articulate rhodes scholar its not like i want to watch the english patient but how about a plot and some dialogue die hard lethal weapon first blood this was not i would have been more entertained watching a steven seagal or jeanclaude van damme movie fu fandango i want my money back
May 17 2015,positive,plot was a bit weird but the makeup and the action was cool
May 17 2015,positive,best action movie of this year non stop action
May 17 2015,positive,a totally metal action flick with absolutely beautiful cgi and cinematography i personally wouldve liked more meaningful dialogue but hey whatever destruction
May 17 2015,positive,mad max made me come so hard my balls are now the withered wasteland the movie is set in
May 17 2015,positive,exhilarating thrillingmust watch for an action movie buff 
May 17 2015,negative,the fourth mad max epic defies the usual run of jaunty often cackhanded modern blockbusters this uncompromising raucous action outing approaches the bitter truth of survival without knavish quiver it relies on visceral sensations like the breathtaking barren landscape amble stride and chase scenes shot with inimitable legerity     charlize theron is a simply fascinating personage and at her plaintive best all these license the film reward for giving little thought to genre convention and its own barbaric uniqueness prestige has been put back into action cinema
May 17 2015,positive,one of the best action movies i have ever seen easily
May 17 2015,positive,visually this movie is just amazing  even though theres no plot to speak of i was thoroughly entertained  i cant believe they found so many ways to essentially blow up trucks and create chase scenes
May 17 2015,positive,mad max fury road is an outstanding film george miller has the courage and more importantly the skill to create a cinematic event for the ages this is what film is all about kudos to the studio head who gave george miller a hundred million dollars 30 years after his original hit screens
May 17 2015,positive,an action movie sprint from beginning to end
May 17 2015,positive,i wont say its the best one since i havent seen the original movies but it was pretty good action wise fulfilling plot wise ok definitely not as horrible as i thought it couldve been when i first saw the trailer hardly as bad contentwise as i had originally thought it would be overall decent good genre of film solid entertainment 
May 17 2015,positive,455  my best action movie of the year so far awesome  stop what youre doing and go see it now p
May 17 2015,negative,total rubbishlost interest after the first 5 min when they cut his hair and beard and made him look like a hollywood star what kidnappers do that
May 17 2015,positive,loved it great film  i am a huge mad max fan so i was worried about this film and what it would do to the series but its great  i loved it  if you liked the original three films or two of them anyway you must watch it
May 17 2015,negative,theron removes mad maxs penis and now we have mad maxine  great genre turned into a feminist piece of unbelievable junk  you could see the the producer bowed to political correctness and feminized every scene of the movie from mothers milk to pregnant princesses and in the end senior biker chicks with muskets    theron is a posing one armed superchick not believable  mad max mainly grunts a lot since his penis has been removed and he is choking on it
May 17 2015,positive,amazing  so much fun to watch hardy is awesome and so is theron
May 17 2015,positive,beautifully shot great sound and nonstop action  hard to imagine how to pack more quality raw action in a movie  simple plot but fun
May 17 2015,positive,one of the greatest action films ive ever seen
May 17 2015,positive,fn awesome having watched the original when it came out i can say that this one definitely captured the look and feel while utilizing the latest movie magic
May 17 2015,positive,mad max fury road is a postapocalyptic thriller by director george miller about a society of bloodthirsty scavengers living in a desert wasteland after society blows itself up the overlord is able to keep his subjects at bay because he provides them with sustenance and water which has become a rare commodity one of his lieutenants charlize theron defects and takes a harem of women from him he is using for breeding and kidnaps them a renegade drifter tom hardy gets caught up in the morass and teams up with theron to try to find a place that is rumored to have sustenance called the green place having never seen a mad max film i cannot profess to compare it to others but this film is definitely gritty and over the top and is a cross between dune and grindhouse films i enjoyed the sheer adrenaline rush of the car chases and the nonstop riveting action the film is very campy and this integrates nicely into the action scenes this film is not for the faint of heart and the viewer will just be in awe at the visual splendor of effects and the environmental obstacles the team encounters the film does not hold your hand and expects you to be quick on the uptake of the details or they will elude you this was an excellent film with action that never ceases from the opening credits  b
May 17 2015,neutral,what  a dissapointment  mad max isnt even the main character just an action spectaclenothing morehighly uninvolvingpeople were walking out of the theatertom hardy has nothing to work withhis mad max in boringall the great scenes were shown in the previewsone thing the film has going for it if the unbelievable stuntwork just like the last transformer your bombarded with actionand dont care  a shallow but beautifully filmed piece of work
May 17 2015,positive,engrossing the two hours flew by and left me wanting more gimme more
May 17 2015,positive,four words this shit was nuts
May 17 2015,positive,george millers longgestating followup to his classic postapocalyptic trilogy delivers in every single way  mad max fury road is a beautifully ghastly trough full of blood and petroleum topped off with lovable characters and a riproaring score
May 17 2015,negative,this was not a good movie it has no story line like the real one i dont even give it one star
May 17 2015,positive,a refreshingly feminist storyline beautiful cinematography and great set design made this sequel or reboot to the franchise a great one
May 17 2015,positive,kick ass and take names nothing more to be said
May 17 2015,positive,wall to wall action   good plot and little dialogue  this is now my favorite mad max movie just barely dethroning the road warrior
May 17 2015,positive,intense apocalyptic ride through the gates of valhalla it has everything a mad max fan needs loved the colors and the overall car crashes
May 17 2015,negative,i felt more emotionally attached to the sandwich i ate before than any character in this film the movie looked great and was action packed but had no substance less substance than the transformer movies if you dont care about plot acting or back story youll probably like this movie it  would be a good movie to watch on tv if you have nothing else to do and want to watch a movie only for its action
May 17 2015,positive,a potent visceral movie with amazing action and mesmerizing choreography
May 17 2015,negative,again hollywood takes a once great movie and throws so many special effects at it you feel like you are going to have an aneurysm by the end  if you are a true mad max fan you are gonna hate this overdone pos film  im sure newbies will love it since story line and character building doesnt mean crapola any more  was so excited for this movie was so disappointed
May 17 2015,positive,this is a masterpiece of the action genre but it also transcends this narrow category it is first of all visually breathtaking miller is a film director who is passionate about color and landscape and drama unlike many of the cgi fireworks displays these days this film creates beauties that cohere very well with the themes of the film fury road is operatic and gleeful in its overthetop characters and imagery but it is also a film with a heart
May 17 2015,positive,one of the best action movies i have seen in awhile
May 17 2015,positive,i love all the mad max movies  grew up since i was 13 watching them and my favorite was always the road warrior mad max fury road has blown all of the previous films out of the way it delivered the best action sequences ive ever seen on any movie screen in my life and im 27  immortan joe is one of the greatest villians to ever grace the movie screen he is relentless and terrifying tom hardy you delivered well and showed how badass and relentless mad max is if i can tell you anything else best movie of 2015 and will go down ass the best action movie of all time george miller youre a mastermind
May 17 2015,positive,this movie is not only everything i hoped it would be it surprised me in ways that i never expected furiosa is now the bar by which i will measure the warrior characters i write and maxs insane world has never been so rich with fascinating anticivilization
May 17 2015,positive,its a theater experience must dont wait for dvd
May 17 2015,positive,non stop action mostly carries this film only giving you moments to breath after 45 minutes of chase scenes the characters clearly have depth but unfortunately like the cars we quickly leave them behind and following max off into the horizon the visual spectacle of this alone is enough to check it out in my opinion i would have liked less chase and more world building for the first 13 but thoroughly enjoyed it regardless
May 17 2015,positive,i left the theater with a headache
May 17 2015,positive,the movie was total bad ass and full of nonstop action i loved the soundtrack score as well by tom holkenburg i want to see this movie again and again
May 17 2015,positive,one of the best movies ive seen in a long time pure genius it is the definition of an actionthriller creative visually stunning and mad pure madness
May 17 2015,positive,kinetic visually stunning fatiguing theres about 15 minutes of nonaction in the movie
May 17 2015,positive,in the action cinematic sea of shit out of the wasteland of fast and furiously green screened hollywood crap comes a filmed masterpiece that will blow your mind no you just didnt snort an eight ball or take 2 hits of acid you are not hallucinating this this is not buts in the seat filmmaking made from thousands of fingers drilling on cgi keyboards this is as real as action cinema gets real risks real desert real stunts over 2000 shots hundreds of hours on film hundreds of custom fabricated vehicles years of preparation months of toil in the desert  all of this cinematic blood sweat and madness is for you so dont watch this on your iphone or tablet this is a cinematic gift given to you from one of the true geniuses of our time mr george miller and for a 70 year old man to have the energy passion and desire to work this hard for you well he deserves your 15 bucks spent in the theater you probably will never see anything like this again in your life time so dont rush to avenging iron man hell do fine without you its this very rare breed of film that will go extinct if you dont support it
May 17 2015,positive,absolutely fantastic godtier movie
May 17 2015,positive,kept me in my seat the beginning was confusing but eventually the story made some sense the action was non stop fun and i liked it
May 17 2015,positive,a masterpiece that moves directly into cult classic brilliant wish i had been in the art department hats off to everyone involved in making this epic tribute
May 17 2015,positive,the special effects set design vehicles were very good the plot on the other hand was pretty bad i was not expecting much but if you think about it at all there are huge plot holes there was a lot of action though if you just want post apocalypse action this is your movie it was entertaining but mad max has 0 charisma in this movie
May 17 2015,positive,im a huge fan of the originals but this movie standalone was such a treat the stunts the action the craziness loved every second of it
May 17 2015,positive,best movie ive seen in a long time just awesome
May 17 2015,positive,excellent action film easily one of the best ever madegreat performances by all with gorgeous cinematography and an excellent score
May 17 2015,positive,this film was just flatout amazing the perfect blend of exhilarating action character development and while while being insane but excellently grounded left me on the edge of my seat cheering and completely satisfied what a film what a lovely film 910
May 17 2015,positive,george millers mad max fury road holds no bounds in its trek across the desert landscape  what a lovely day    littered with little character buildup and a paper thin plotline the 2 hour adventure goes offroad with tons of vehicle carnage  there are enough story details as needed but ultimately its all there to setup the next incident on fury road    the violence is erratic over the top and highly entertaining  a good combination of cg as well as real vehicle demolishings come as advertised  there is so much going on the film manages to leave the want for even more    tom hardy is a man of few words it is no wonder the film belongs to charlize theron with nicholas hoult following in her footsteps  seriously the film could have been called furiosa road    theres no secret here  mad max fury road delivers what is expected of it
May 17 2015,positive,bad ass in a sea of repetitive predictable cliche action titles mad max fury road is explosively original creative and chockablock full of focused furious adrenaline
May 17 2015,positive,an incredible movie this is george millers masterpiece everyone should make it their mission in life to see this movie at least once

May 17 2015,positive,best action movie of this decade it was freakin crazy
May 17 2015,positive,probably the best example of escapism in a while if not ever there were a few times i snapped out of a haze of adrenaline and excitement and had to remember oh im in a movie theater im hard pressed to think of a movie that does engaging entertainment escapist fantasy that well awesome consistent action perfect gender perspective and just fun fun fun oh and gorgeous
May 17 2015,positive,the level of awesome i just witnessed should be illegal  this movie is insane  its a heaping serving of off the rails gonzo with a side of holygoddamnshit crackers  i thought the road warrior could never be topped and would forever stand as the single greatest postapocalyptic roadepic ever created  i was wrong  i was oh so wonderfully wrong  george miller has raised the bar with a magnum opus of mayhem that action movie directors will study and emulate for years to come  this may not be star wars or the matrix but by god it should be  and it does it all without the help of pesky things like story or characterization because fuck that noise  this is mad goddam max  this movie is the most metal of heavy metal songs doused in diesel and set on fire    mad max fury road gets a see this right goddam now on talons movie scale
May 17 2015,positive,enthralled from start to finish  what a timeless action bonanza
May 17 2015,positive,through out the years you see all kinds of action movies youve seen good ones and bad ones though after seeing this movie you wonder have you really seen good action movies this generation or have we been given so many mediocre ones that we have forgotten what a great looks like after seeing this masterpiece of an action movie you truly question
May 17 2015,positive,great action relatively shallow story
May 17 2015,neutral,ehh the trailer was better than the film thats never a good thing
May 17 2015,positive,easily the best action movie of the past decade visually stunning in every way imaginable george miller has put together an epic masterpiece of filmmaking
May 17 2015,positive,awesome movie non stop action and incredible stunts wow 
May 17 2015,positive,it makes the original and sequel look extremely tame by comparison  its easier to count the minutes not spent in epic battle sequences  tom hardy plays an adequate max but i found nicholas hoults nux to be one of the most interesting characters  my only real question is how do these vehicles which have got to guzzle gas like theres no tomorrow manage to race for hundreds of miles seemingly and never go dry
May 17 2015,positive,jaw dropping loved it
May 17 2015,positive,pure adrenalin i felt like running cars off the road on the way home from the theater
May 17 2015,positive,one of the best movies of 2015 so far and an immediate classic
May 17 2015,positive,been waiting for this movie for a long time and it surpassed my expectations the only tiny negative thing i could say is that tom hardy as amazing as his was couldnt duplicate the crazy look in his eyes that mel gibson is so good at other then that it was 2 hours of amazong

May 17 2015,positive,one of the best action films ive ever seen
May 17 2015,negative,abysmal visually beautiful but utterly bereft of surprise irony interest or humanity how many critics did they bribe to get at 98  rating one long pointless overstylized chase scene
May 17 2015,positive,mad max fury road was an epic end of the world apocalypse movie looking forward to adding to my blu ray collection at home im goin to watch it again
May 17 2015,positive,incredible movie fasten your seatbelts remember to breathe    the cinematography is phenomenally fantastic and at times uncomfortable yet compelling it really is something worthy of experience on the big screen  rare these days a fitting contribution to the the franchise if not a transcendence

May 17 2015,positive,spectacular thrilling intense actionpacked pretty much flawless direction whatever youve heard about the film it should be positive in which case it is so nothing to complain i mean really this is the action film of 2010s george miller is here to save the genre
May 17 2015,positive,rat rods and a guitar that shoots flames what more could you ask for none stop action this  movie was awesome
May 17 2015,positive,charlize theron was excellent her costar tom hardy was also excellent little disjointed and ridiculous but so were the originals thought the sand storm would have been better incorporated into the finale entertaining with some great visual effects
May 17 2015,positive,greatly entertaining
May 17 2015,positive,non stop action  at first we couldnt decide if we loved it or hated it but it turned out that we enjoyed the heck out of it  however the original mad max was a lot better
May 17 2015,positive,beyond awesome i will watch it again
May 17 2015,positive,ive never seen such actionpacked mayhem in a movie before beyond over the top chaos utter chaos a whirlwind inside a tornado during an earthquake during a lightning sandstorm scored by a mobile heavy metalphazon sound system monster truck unit with massive subwoofers on wheels    ive also never seen a movie more packed with pregnant sex slaves but ill leave that to feminists to mull over lol i loved them  max remains an awesome character he hasnt been watered down in the least hes just as nihilistic and even crazier than the max of the previous three films he is not above lying or sacrificing other protagonists to survive a true antihero not good  not bad his only goal is to survive   other than him who we know every other character is a blank whos filled in by their actions as the story progresses brilliant characterizations from each sex slave to the slave boy who gets high on chrome spray paint to the old broa but i dont wana give that away     charlize therons character is no ripley or sarah connor  theres no time for that but she does hold her own and kicks ass     mad maxs post apocalytpic world is as sharply drawn as ever   believable but also mysterious because not everything is explained ad nauseum as a viewer you have to figure it out by the cryptic phrases uttered and by the incredible detail in the background of all the establishing shots and the sheer creativity of the vehicles and the production design repeated viewings im sure would draw out more     in terms of action movies this year ive seen godzilla furious7 avengers age of ultron and mad max fury road     fury road clobbers them all its no contest the others come off like inept student films compared to it 70yo director george miller has utterly humiliated every other action director working today this may be the greatest mic drop in the history of cinema follow this you bitches    im not sure if the 3d added alot or not all i know is i feel spent i cant go again just yet
May 17 2015,positive,mad max fury road was just plain genius its action was nonstopvery creative and lots of fun it brings you to a whole new postapocalyptic world that is filled with one crazy turn after another with its actionpacked scenes creativity and great actors mad max fury road will have you leaving the theater smiling and pumped up

May 17 2015,positive,two words  bad ass
May 17 2015,positive,finally an action movie that doesnt rely on explosions and eye candy looking at you michael bay graced with great acting from the cast tom hardy fills the role of the enigmatic max perfectlybadass and all the vagabond who finds himself in the middle of things and reluctantly helps to save the dayjust so he can have enough gas for his car the villan while still being a gas desired maniac is fresh and ever so evilnot to mention frieghtening and is a formidable oppenent to the asskicking furiosa charlize theron who simply wants to get away from him while helping some others along the way the score was enthralling the scenes were heart pounding the costumesmakeup were ever so fitting and the story was incredible wraped all together with george millers direction is a recipe for fantastic
May 17 2015,negative,all action and no heart
May 17 2015,positive,a perfect action film not much more needs to be said
May 17 2015,positive,those who didnt like it better open your eyes and watch 10 years to the past and tell its not the coolest film in a decade
May 17 2015,negative,let us not forget warner bros own rotten tomatoes
May 17 2015,positive,definitely going to be the number 1 movie behind star wars this movie was phenomenal
May 17 2015,positive,a movie that is literally a 2 hour car chase my least favourite thing made amazing because the people making it gave a fuck about what they were doing
May 17 2015,negative,mad max fury road is absolutely and utterly awful its just a series of car chasing explosions with no detectable plot or acting tom hardy is an exceptional talent and deserves more than a few grunts it would have been better being named mad charleize
May 17 2015,positive,i thought the trailers made this movie look ridiculous i went to this movie thinking it would be a movie that would underperform and underwhelm man was i wrong action packed and pure fun i enjoyed it from beginning to end and was left wanting more much more fun than the avengers has potential to be the best movie of the summer
May 17 2015,positive,good action it felt like a mad max movie
May 17 2015,positive,super cool    nonstop action   crazy pace at times   too much focus on cherie theron needed more max needs a sequel we need more max
May 17 2015,positive,this is a fantastic movie action from beginning to end the only downside is dialogue is limited and sometimes unable to understand
May 17 2015,positive,a nonstop high octane carnage and imaginative vehicle filled adrenaline ride with a brilliantly realize gritty and engrossing world
May 17 2015,positive,it goes boom and it makes you care this is how action movies are supposed to be made fury road is absolute perfection on fire
May 17 2015,positive,mad max fury road is a nonstop breathtaking action packed movie that will keep you at the edge of your seat with a simple premise and story the movie manages to engage audiences into spectacular action set pieces using tons of practical effects although the movie is named mad max a debate could be made that charlize theron is the main character of this movie a badass multi dimensional character in the serach of redemption while max is just a conduct a vessel through wich the story is told and thats a good thing it captures the personality and traits of the character that mel gibson made so iconic 30 years ago mad max fury road is a feast to the eye and to the heart and mind as well in between all the car chases and the amazing set pieces theres a very clear message and social commentary about the society we live in and what in reality one day might happen if we dont change our ways of living i realy encourage you to rush to your nearest theater to see this marvelous film and recomend this movie
May 17 2015,positive,petal 2 the metal from start to finish i couldnt decide if i was watching a movie or the outcome of californias water shortage
May 17 2015,positive,everything good in action i think we revived the genre
May 17 2015,positive,this movie is wild the wildest mad max yet absolutely unbelievably awesome
May 17 2015,negative,visually amazing the vehicles and costumes really deliver but as far as story and acting nicholas hoult is the only bright spot so if youre looking for a visually spectacular 2 hour chase scene youll love it but it left me bored after about 20 minutes
May 17 2015,positive,mad max fury road is one of the best action films ive seen in a long long time george miller is back with mad max after beyond the thunder dome which was 30 years ago directors who usually return to a franchise who started it dont end up really good some examples are george lucas for star wars the phantom menace or steven spielberg for indiana jones 4 but george miller proves that he can bring a franchise back to life this is probably one of the best action films of the summer so far tom hardy as max did a fine job but charlize theron as furiosa is amazing her character kicked some major ass the story was also great and it was very simple its just getting from point a to point b the action was amazing and there wasnt any of that shaky cam george millers direction is amazing because he uses some wide shots which looks amazing the movie is also very intense i also felt hot while i was watching this movie because it takes place in a desert like area i really loved how much of the action was done practical because today action films do cgi for touch shots but in this film it was all done with practical effects which made it feel real this film isnt for everyone the film is very weird and crazy which most people cant take if your a mad max fan youll enjoy the hell out of this film mad max fury road is one of the best films this summer and one of my favorite films this year i really hope we get to see more mad max films in the next couple years because this film deserves all the money it needs and sequels it needs
May 17 2015,positive,waited 30 years for this however it was worth it hands down in my opinion road warrior was the best nonstop action movie there is a new 2 george miller still has what it takes tom hardy makes a good max and charlize theron adds to the film took my 3 sons to see itas we left we all said great
May 17 2015,positive,do you like deafening explosions mumbled 2 word conversations and bodies tossed every which way  then this is the movie for you honestly i didnt understand a single word in the movie  cant  guaranty that it was in english
May 17 2015,positive,every piece of promotional material for this movie should have from the director of babe and happy feet splashed across the top
May 17 2015,positive,ok to be fair i havent seen the movies that had mel gibson cause i wanted to go in open minded story was basic and simple but the visual effects were spectacular i saw it in 3d and it showed im curious what original fans will think of this movie and ill watch the classics now that ive seen this one 3 stars out of 5
May 17 2015,positive,high octane for about 9095 of the film would have liked to have had 1015 mins dedicated to maxs back story but i understand that it is not a reboot was not bothered by the feminist angle near the end of the film and i also felt that many of the critics got it wrong about max hardy taking a backseat to furiosa theron and that is one of the strong points of the film and that was both characters got to shine in the action sequences    speaking of the action sequences it was great to see this type of action film making once again the scenes were perfectly shot and the stunts were magnificent also major kudos to the cinematographer because the landscapes in this film really enhanced the action  the 98 rating by the critics was warranted one of the greatest action films in the last 20 years to be honest
May 17 2015,negative,i threw up in my mouth and swallowed itbest part of the movie
May 17 2015,positive,great movie all around movie will keep you in your seat after the movie wanting more
May 17 2015,positive,holy shit that was a fun ride
May 17 2015,positive,omg the action sequences of this movie are insane imperator furiosa is my favorite action girl this movie beats furious 7 in my 2015 list
May 17 2015,positive,best stunt work in a movie ever
May 17 2015,negative,what a piece of crap  unending cliches ripped off from the 1970s
May 17 2015,positive,2 hours of the craziest st i have ever seenthe music relentlesstoo much to absorb a must see twice to digest
May 17 2015,positive,good and wellpaced but i am not completely in love
May 17 2015,positive,mad max is full of nonstop action from start to finish it is a visual masterpiece in every sense but it is light on story and has almost no character development to speak of
May 17 2015,positive,near perfect great action and characters
May 17 2015,positive,a completely bonkers kind of action insanity we havent seen before on the big screen you owe it to yourself to see this film on the biggest screen possible
May 17 2015,positive,best movie ive seen in a while
May 17 2015,positive,an extremely welldone addition to the mad max franchise  tom harding shined as max and charlize played a true badass bitch  if i had one complaint it is that it could have used a touch more back story to flesh out maxs history
May 17 2015,positive,brutal the filmmakers manage to create a realistic setting with overthetop characters it was a wild ride
May 17 2015,negative,this movie is long loud and boring  there is a thin plot and is mostly not about mad max  how much are you all being paid to over hype this bombastic piece of trash
May 17 2015,neutral,the movie was visually impressive but in the end it was a road race to one place and then when nothing was there they turned around and raced back  i was not impressed with the plot  if the story had as much imagination as the design elements it would have been a great movie
May 17 2015,negative,worst piece of you know what i have seen in a long time walked out 30 minutes in should have left in the first scene this movie is for adolescents with no attention span luckily i got my money back
May 17 2015,negative,i thought it felt empty and hollow i was an almost 2 hour car chase i got bored with it
May 17 2015,positive,exactly what i expected and it was great
May 17 2015,positive,overall i enjoyed the movie some parts i felt were undeveloped or just didnt make much sense i was entertained for most of the 2 hours but found myself thinking ok get to it already more than once
May 17 2015,positive,best action movie this decade enough said
May 17 2015,positive,a 2 hour car chase with depth and anti misogyny goodness just go see it already
May 17 2015,positive,it is loud brutal and exhilarating it is hard to drive the speed limit afterwards when i grow up i want to join the vulvalini
May 17 2015,negative,well done but not my kind of movie
May 17 2015,negative,overrated movie of the year great action but thats it what happen to the story or the character development probally one of the most disappointing movie this year
May 17 2015,positive,awesome movie need to see it in the theater
May 17 2015,positive,all action all the time stunning visuals and amazing action there was very little story to it and i still have yet to find out what the heck is wrong with tom hardy voice in the film i originally thought it was because he was getting sand in his mouth but he talked like he was a czech throughout charlize theron as furiosa wow
May 17 2015,positive,amazing movie one of the best actions movies in recent memory seriously watch it
May 17 2015,positive,now thats a summer movie story could have used a bit more depth to flesh out certain parts for clarity and motive but what a ride its nice to have max back and nobody can do crazy better than george miller the entire feel of the movie was incredible the look amazing loved it
May 17 2015,positive,nonstop action impactful story and visually splendid
May 17 2015,positive,mad max fury road is filled with spectacular action and great crazy characters it is required viewing for any action movie fan
May 17 2015,positive,this is why we go to the movies pure entertainment i cant remember the last time i had this much fun
May 17 2015,positive,one of the best movies ive seen in a long time
May 17 2015,positive,mad max  fury road is a wild ride start to finishd tom hardy was great in the role of max and charlize theron was a bad ass furiosa george miller pucked up where left off while upgrading every facet of film making killer flick
May 17 2015,positive,this is a very entertaining movie for what it is meant to be however i think it has a very small plot that is very simple  this movie is nonstop action and can get very repetitive
May 17 2015,positive,i love the way george miller is still involved this is probably the only time that i can recall a reboot outshining the original the action is simple breathtaking and completely mental pure carnage it is films like this that makes you just love cinema a modern classic
May 17 2015,positive,nobody is going to say this an art movie because of all the action and production value but it is its art and it works at all levels this is why we go movies
May 17 2015,positive,mad max fury road is about a ultraviolent road chase in a postapocalyptic landscape  mad max furry road is about a ultraviolent road chase in a postapocalyptic landscape while people wear plush animal costumes
May 17 2015,positive,greatest action movie ever made a fucking masterpiece
May 17 2015,positive,a crazy outrageous over the top action moviei loved it
May 17 2015,positive,madmax furyroad is the best action film of the year    badass kickass and nonstop action from start to finish tom hardy and charlize theron get the job done director george miller hasnt lost his touch    go see it
May 17 2015,positive,an unquestionable classic for its jawdropping action alone mad max fury road is also a master class in economical worldbuilding and storytelling its hard to believe a film can be any more skillfully made than this
May 17 2015,positive,this is one of the most complete and compellingand utterly beautifully insanecinematic visions ive ever seen put to film george miller was a masterful worldbuilder with his original mad max films but with fury road he leaves all other postapocalyptic actionthrillers in his abundant dust dont wait till home video this is what big screens were made for
May 17 2015,positive,great movie a movie in its own class of movies now
May 17 2015,positive,100 pure adrenaline top notch action from the very start and doesnt stop until the credits roll have to admit i like many of you was extremely sceptical of this outing without gibson at the helm but hardy did the role justice and if you look at this as a stand alone movie rather than a sequel you will realise just how awesome it truly is
May 17 2015,positive,this one was something else great car scenes and intensity also makes you very thirsty
May 17 2015,positive,a spectacle of pure unadulterated mindless violence in all its glory
May 17 2015,positive,without a doubt the best action movie sinceforever very intense perfectly cast totally weird and violent best time ive had at the movies in a really really long time  must see for you action fans and see it with max sound system theater unbelievable
May 17 2015,positive,its a reboot theres some obvious changing of the events from the old trilogy but its the greatest of all reboots max max is back
May 17 2015,positive,from the beautiful barren landscapes to the crazy war boy guitar solos fury road is a nonstop on the edge of your seat ride that even your girlfriend will enjoy dont expect the same plot from the 80s but enjoy the same nuances and bigger development of the origins of the war boys     even though max as a character doesnt take much to act out hardy does a great job physically even so theron is able to  outshine and keep the ball rolling in this gut wrenching adventure
May 17 2015,positive,it was very action packed definitely a mans movie
May 17 2015,positive,amazing cinematography amazing music nonstop action character development throughout this movie is perfect
May 17 2015,negative,over 2 hours of killing with minimal change in the characters relationships about an hour too long i dont think anyone was impressed when they got to the green island and turned back   watched with james and friends at southbank
May 17 2015,positive,a vibrant and unique feat of filmmaking that serves as a needed benchmark for action movies in the 21st century
May 17 2015,positive,story premise is simple but the look of the movie score and action is top notch movies like this dont made much anymore
May 17 2015,positive,wild intense and super fun
May 17 2015,negative,i wanted this to be a fun movie with little mental effort on my part but even going in with that expectation this movie was a huge let down cheap frenetic camera work moves each scene so quickly that you arent able to enjoy the aesthetic the likely drew you into the theater in the first place my movie going group decided that our time was worth more than the money wed spent so we walked out before the halfway point im surprised we waited so long if you want a fun action movie check out shoot em up or either of the grindhouse movies planet terror or death proof dont waste your money of this one
May 17 2015,positive,amazing you will be visually blown away go now
May 17 2015,positive,it takes some time to get used what youll be in for for the next two hours but once youre settled in mad max will simply blow you away  some of the greatest action sequences ever created impeccable direction and powerful female characters makes mad max beautifully riveting
May 17 2015,positive,mad max fury road is the action movie ive been waiting to see in my five years of film reviewing  i havent been waiting around in agony like a southern belle longing for her rhett butler  i have instead been continuously leaving the theaters of various actioners pleasantly charmed  but thrills yes thrills have been kept at a minimum  sure its fun to see cgi likable actors and bombastic set pieces mix it up with the delirium of a succulent martini  yet these days action movies seem serviceable great for two hours but not for much else  they dont stick with you you end up ranking their greatness in the scheme of other films in their franchise  immediately after captain america the winter soldier last year for instance my sister and i spent most of the ride home arguing about whether it was better than the original avengers hardly talking about what we liked about it what made it such a success  i cant really complain about the current state of action though  i liked the avengers 2  i thought furious 7 contained some seriously spectacular car chases  but missing from them is a sense of originality  as they exist in a sort of real world as the characters are familiar as the good copbad cop dynamic is predictable were there more out of obligation to the franchise  as the years go by a sameness is setting in  the minute i grabbed a seat for fury road last night i didnt know what to expect  the first three mad max movies ending thirty years ago with the imaginative beyond thunderdome were cynical explosions of dystopian disaster where the mindset is kill or be killed and the lead character the titular max isnt so much a hero as he is a wounded guy trying to survive  the mad max movies are so seminal because the action is so unforced the remaining population is so willing to slaughter for the final drops of gasoline to propel their decked out vehicles that the films may as well be called mad max vs the world  no one is ever ever safe  you can count on max to survive but you cant bet that the world will be a better place after he fends off his latest opponent  fiery and desolate the balmy lands of the postapocalyptic future are never much of a haven  max isnt a hero rather a man who can work a gun and a car and who seems to constantly be in the wrong place at the wrong time  fury road has been called a reboot of the original franchise but reboot seems too plain a word  reboot suggests laziness a robocop no ones in the mood for  with the same director at the helm george miller fury road is a reawakening a rollicking continuation and a startling return to form  certainly it is the most brutal of all the mad max films not for the screeching sissies of the population  but it is also among the finest action movies in the history of cinema  we have been able to stomach superheroes smashing goons into the buildings of new york city probably killing hundreds of civilians in the process for so long  here consequences are really consequences  the characters are vulnerable however heroic or villainous they may be and the action sequences produce just as much of a thrill as they do a shudder  for once something humane in us lights when someone gets crushed by a mountainous vehicle  tom hardy replacing mel gibson portrays max rockatansky a loner deep in the australian outback attempting to hide from the dangers of the recent collapse of civilization  only a few minutes into fury road is he kidnapped by the war boys the henchman of the tyrannical immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne who leads and controls a strenuous territory with a massive water source  the war boys are essentially halfdead young men  max in response is provided as a blood bag for the sickly nux nicholas hoult    meanwhile imperator furiosa charlize theron an ally of joe takes off on her war rig to collect gasoline from a nearby pipeline  but after driving off road it becomes clear that she has something else in mind she has brought joes five wives along with her who act as his means of breeding so a chase ensues the nefarious foes close behind  max and furiosa finally meet when nux catches up to the rig  and a partnership is formed  left is a series of car stunts tourdeforce performances imaginative cinematography and a feelup of a dystopian society refreshing among a sea of ones filled with sexy teens and hunger games  i have no doubt that fury road will repel many paying customers  the film is so bleak so actionpacked so barbarous so bloody so disturbing so wholly original that something conventional and thoroughly pg13 will suit some people much better  i opposite of some of the lightweights out there was thrilled not only by fury roads action but also by millers visionary handling of it all  i could gush for several more paragraphs but that would be an entirely different essay perhaps an article appreciating its artistic achievements  immortan joes territory along with his look and his war boys is a triumph in hellacious fear  simply gazing upon his lair his parched population instills terror in us  he is one of the most frightening villains in recent action movies but is it because there isnt much to him besides uncompromising evil   the aesthetic of fury road is something of a punky raging pulp novel cars are covered in metal spikes guns are an extension of the arms of the characters  night scenes are drowned in a cerulean blue the days a ferocious orange bullets eye patches and skulls arent simply decor  theyre part of the landscape as natural as the air as the dirt  even part of joes entourage is an electric guitar player who strums whenever shit is about to go down  these touches may be laughed at by some but as a part of millers vision theyre something of a wonder  and while the film may include the name mad max in its title furiosa is the hero of fury road and the female action hero weve all been waiting for  long gone are the busty black widows and lara crofts with her metallic placeholder for an arm oil warpaint bald head as a stab at gender reversal she is an embodiment of zeroed in anger  therons performance is by turns explosive and vulnerable  you wont be forgetting furiosa any time soon  you can disagree with me all you want but mad max fury road is the best action movie of the decade  before you completely write this statement off the map though consider this what was the last action movie that really surprised you really slapped you around and didnt ask if you wanted to take a five minute smoke break this is visionary filmmaking action or otherwise
May 17 2015,positive,perfect absolutely perfect
May 17 2015,positive,1982s iconic the road warrior is the obvious template for this latest remakerebootrevamped version which delivers outrageous stunts mixed with mindblowing fx but falls short as most remakes do of capturing the heart and soul of the original classic but still worth a watch    a good solid start to what could be a brand new trilogy kind of stumbled across the finish line but great action fx and visuals looking forward to a sequel 8 out of 10    oh and charlize theron steals the show imho  imperator furiosa is part ripley part sarah connor and just brilliant couldve been called mad maxine furiosa road
May 17 2015,positive,absolutely brilliant
May 17 2015,positive,why movies were made
May 17 2015,positive,probably the best action movie of the year and visually stunning
May 17 2015,positive,visual masterpiece what movies were meant to be
May 17 2015,positive,one of the best action movies sincewell the road warrior  effects are brilliant music well done and well acted  disturbingly beautiful grotesque funny and sad
May 17 2015,positive,this movie can only be summarized as a 2 hour non  stop rollercoaster of pure adrenaline it is beautifully crafted and keeps you at the edge of your seat for the entire time i definitely recommend everyone to see it on the big screen
May 17 2015,negative,this movie was a waste of time this also marks the last time i listen to critics about a movie  mark my words i suppose if you are an adrenaline junkie this would be up your alley i myself prefer mel gibsons mad max better story less filler
May 17 2015,positive,the only bad review that ive read about fury road called the film hollow this is true in some ways but a film about a postapocalyptic world theres bound to be a depressing and macabre feeling to it that being said this only adds to the authenticity of the world youre seeing  even beyond the death and violence there is a sense of humour making this film a fun and thought provoking experience at the same time i loved every minute and my eyes were glued to the imax screen in all its 3d glory
May 17 2015,positive,the best mad max to date two thumbs way up
May 17 2015,negative,if you want to just blow shit up without the slightest glimmer of character andor story for the first 90 minutes you need to stick to that plan for the last 30 and skip the meaningless attempt at trying to say something with the film
May 17 2015,positive,a fantastic pure action film
May 17 2015,positive,nonstop adrenaline rush
May 17 2015,positive,one of the best action epics ever
May 17 2015,positive,absolutely the most original action film ever made if you can find anything that comes close to this epic masterpiece im all ears incredible
May 17 2015,negative,the action was very good until it got repetitive which didnt take very long  the story was lacking there was no back story to speak of and the characters were left as onedimensional cogs in an overblown car chase across the desert  the director made no attempt to explain his disjointed distopia or the motivations of anyone whatsoever  it was mindless drivel and boring action for which youd have to suspend all notion of the physical reality that we know  dont believe the hype
May 17 2015,positive,nitro from start  to finish
May 17 2015,neutral,a good looking summer action movie with no story whatsoever the girl power aspect to it differentiates this from other summer action films but you really would be better off catching this on cable
May 17 2015,positive,this ones pissing off all the right people check your brain at the door types beware for here lies intelligent weighty allegory make no mistake this is a profoundly antiwar anticapitalist and savagely feminist film beneath the surface  but what a fucking surface a breathtaking and relentlessly inventive beast this is possibly the finest action film since i dunno terminator 2 aliens you tell me  ive never seen anything quite like this before everything here is gorgeously shot impeccably edited totally coherent and that rarest of things  meaningful mad max fury road really is like lightning in a bottle theyll be talking about this one for a very long time
May 17 2015,positive,fastest 2 hours of my life
May 17 2015,positive,2hr edge of your seat thrill ridehang on
May 17 2015,positive,a wonderfully crafted  mindblowing  mustseeaction 
May 17 2015,positive,war max  war furiosa  face melting heavy metal
May 17 2015,positive,the script is cut and drytheres a point a and theres a point b  thats it  but i cant remember the last time i saw an action flick with this much pomp and circumstance  this thing is overflowing with so much style and awesome perverted weirdness that it makes you question why studios stopped making action films like this  its one of those rare occasions where you can throw the script into a wood chipper and still be absolutely blown away  this movie literally doesnt stop  its fast its bloody its dirty and it doesnt let up for one moment  hell you could watch this thing on mute and still follow everything thats going on  which is why i have no problem in saying that this is one of the best action films ive seen in nearly a decade    does it have flaws  sure it does  but nearly all the flaws are wrapped around the question why  and it doesnt really matter how many flaws there are  because all the positive aspects tremendously outweigh any negatives you might have  because this is what a true popcorn flick is    this is what action films should be like  this is how they should be made  everything these days is played safe and by the rules  but we all have a vision  and as david fincher said were all perverted and weird  so i hope this movie breaks down that wall  lets get weird with our action movies  lets get crazy with our characters  lets start having fun with camera and really go insane with these big budgets  i hope this spawns something new  i know in my heart that it wont but thank god theres 2 more of these movies coming out  because i cant wait for more  my rating 4 out of 5 stars
May 17 2015,positive,mad max fury road may be the greatest movie ever made
May 17 2015,positive,see it  now  and again
May 17 2015,positive,like all mad max films this mostly made me want to give every last stunt person a hug
May 17 2015,positive,wonderful film by george miller  the world he has created forces most of its inhabitants to focus their lives solely on survival  the landscape is beautifully bleak and a major character in the film  the action is almost constant throughout and the use of real world effects instead of a reliance on cgi is a major benefit  the cast is impressive and you will find yourself mentally engaged until the very end  hope this isnt his last trip to maxs world
May 17 2015,positive,one of the beat films in 2015 so far this film has definitely raised the bar in what an action movie is suppose to be
May 17 2015,positive,4 out of 5 stars  really terrific nonstop action film with fantastic stunt work that should be recognized by the academy  tom hardy is no mel gibson but charlize theron brings her skills as an actress to hold the dramatic through line the entire time  very visual with exceptional cinematography production design vehicle movement  music  a welcome return to form by george miller after a 30 year hiatus from the franchise  its violent but not gory in keeping with the humor of the series
May 17 2015,positive,mad max fury road2015rmay 16  bythe movie guy    george millers crazy intense vision of a postapocalyptic wasteland returns in mad max fury road  the fourth installment of the classic road warrior series on his own in the wasteland  struggling with the demons from his past former cop turned road warrior max tom hardy is captured to be harvested as a blood donor for a group of paleskinned brainwashed minions known as war boys the war boys zealously follow the commands of immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne ruler of the lofty citadel immortan joe controls the supply of food  water distributed to the dirt dwelling ragged masses he also controls the fertility of a group of woman breeders enslaved to bear his children during a supposed supply run imperator furiosa charlize theron joeâtms lieutenant decides to make her escape into the wasteland  return to her birth place which she remembers as the âgreen placeâ with several of joeâtms prized breeders smuggled out in the armoured war rig shes driving one of the wives splendid rosie huntingtonwhitely is carrying joes baby a very valuable property joe  his entire army are soon in hot pursuit of furiosa nux nicholas hoult a passionate  impressionable follower of immortan joe joins them hauling max along for the ride masked  chained to the front of his vehicle as a portable blood bag furiosa leads the army into an epic sandstorm  max gains the upper hand on nax during the battle  attempts to steal the war rig from furiosa forced to join forces to survive max furiosa  the fugitive wives struggle to make through harsh terrain  hostile forces to the safety of green place  mad max series creator george miller returns as writer  director with an incredible highoctane film thatâtms relentlessly actionpacked  leaving the viewer breathless from beginning to end 90 percent of the film was done without the use of cgi which makes it amazing to watch those heartpounding action scenes the performances from tom hardy  charlize theron were superb there is no doubt that tom hardy is the right guy to take over the role of max first played by mel gibson for a whole new generation after seeing this film i found myself watching the three mad max films again mad max 1979 mad max 2 the road warrior 1981  mad max beyond thunderdome1985 just to see how violent those films were compared to this new one which is brutal at times  also  check out the landscapes  filming style in the previous movies george miller remains brilliantly faithful to his vision you all can take the journey with max on the fury road in 2d 3d or imax 3d mustsee film
May 17 2015,positive,its a visual spectaclepure edgeofyourseat entertainmentand will be the most fun youll have at the movies so far this year
May 17 2015,positive,this movie wasawesome i have seen this movie twice and plan to see it again in theaters it is by far the best action movie i have seen in yearsthis movie doesnt only live up to the original three movies it might actually be better than them  this movie is action pure action no matter how hard i try i cant think of a scene in which there wasnt well choreographed action but it wasnt dumb action there was a strong plot backed up by strong and compelling characters  aside from this movie being pure action it is packed with strong performances from tom hardy and charlize theron tom hardy kills it in this role and he only says like 5 lines charlize theron gives a thought provoking and emotionally resonating performance that added undeniable depth to the movie this movie is a must see a
May 17 2015,positive,really intense movie
May 17 2015,positive,the not so awesome thing about mad max fury road is that it is a bit of a the road warrior remake since its been thirty years and im most likely one of the few who still remembers the road warrior that shouldnt be a problem for anyone else yes max isnt the main character in the story thats a good thing though as toms acting is pretty bad next to him charlize deserved an oscar
May 17 2015,positive,brilliant movie okay so its not the originals but it fits well with the mood of them  i will actually go back and watch it again  definitely go too see this film its one for the big screen thats for sure
May 17 2015,positive,while its not short on thrills fury road lacks the heart of the originals
May 17 2015,positive,unique and pretty fun to watch not a mustsee though
May 17 2015,neutral,i have a hard time getting past 45 minutes of this movie im a huge fan of the original mad max shot really well looks amazing i have a hard time paying attention
May 17 2015,positive,the movie i think everyone wanted beyond thunderdome to be even better than the road warrior
May 17 2015,positive,george miller returns to the mad max franchise nearly 30 years since the original trilogy finished  this reboot of the franchise is violent fast paced imaginative and at times makes purely no sense but in a good way    tom hardys performance as max is good though largely about his body language and posture than dialogue  true to the first two movies he doesnt have much dialogue    charlize theron steals the show as onearmed woman furiosa and shes superb in what is essentially the lead role    truly crazy this movie was a blur of action and imaginative set pieces
May 17 2015,positive,if there is a mustsee film to see this summer its mad max fury road this is the best action movie in a decade its just a gauntlet of chaos of destruction save for one fleeting moment it never steps off the gas pedal tom hardy was born to play mad max to say he is a worthy successor to mel gibson would be an understatement charlize theron however is a revelation here a strong welldeveloped hero for the ages youll be cheering the entire way through it would be an amusement park ride if you werent glued to your seat what a thrill
May 17 2015,positive,i was very excited for avengers and after seeing both i loved this movie a lot more then avengers
May 17 2015,positive,pure unadulterated blast of action old school craft backed by superlative performances
May 17 2015,positive,it is not just an action movie
May 17 2015,positive,very well paced and purely entertaining one of the best action movies ive seen in a long time
May 17 2015,positive,this is one of the most intense action movies i have ever seen  the whole movie is pretty much a nonstop ride  charlize theron is amazing in this movie  tom hardy is great as max but i feel his character could have used a tad more exposition  still this movie is incredible
May 17 2015,positive,was a good reboot just they tease you with seeing maxs face for close to 45 min it felt  there were a few parts that were drawn out but overall if your a fan  it doesnt come close to road warrior but close to thunderdome  would check it out you wont leave thrilled or disappointed kinda in the middle  the special effects are good but at some points go to fast  would be great on bluray
May 17 2015,positive,go see it even if you are remotely familiar with the max series this is the film george would have made if he had the budget back in the eighties powerful beautiful in many ways i could go on and on go see it nuff said
May 17 2015,positive,very good action movie  dont expect to a big twisted plot and big dialogues though
May 17 2015,positive,this may be the perfect action movie it makes no promises and holds no bars not really a good way to describe it just see it 9510
May 17 2015,negative,stupid plot stupid villain stupid max stupid effects stupid editing  saw this with 6 people we all hated it
May 17 2015,positive,fantastic cinema exciting and full of adrenaline
May 17 2015,positive,excellent movie just as well written as the other mad max films tons of action great villains beautiful and stunning cgi
May 17 2015,positive,great action movie on its own but not indicative of any mad max films i was expecting something reminiscent of the mad max trilogy but it wasnt the closest it came to reminding me of a mad max film were the visual nods towards thunderdome and a once towards road warrior max seemed to be an afterthought and no where near the main focus they shouldve called him bob and created a stand alone movie this film would have impressed me more if theyd cut the mad max trilogy ties im kind of mad about how much we spent on 3d tickets only to have the whole movie focus on charliz theron plus about half way through the 3d wow factor disappeared its like they forgot the rest of the movie was supposed to be 3d wait until it comes out on dvd kids if youre a diehard max fan like me youll be let down big time im pretty sure tom hardy had about 11 lines the entire movie i really wish there had been more tom hardy accurate flash backs and that the story involved max more and didnt just use him as some muscle here and there
May 17 2015,positive,now that is how to make an action movie michael bay take note
May 17 2015,positive,a nearly perfect film  one of the most incredible experiences ive ever had at a movie theater in my life  in many ways it feel like a  celebration of stunt men and their talents  i also loved the color palette in the film  incredibly beautiful to watch an emotional roller coaster of a movie that takes your emotions to extreme highs and lows  i highly recommend it
May 17 2015,negative,98 rating on rotten tomatoes this film is proof that the world is full of morons
May 17 2015,negative,pretentious no storyline and ridiculous
May 17 2015,positive,insane action extravaganza and one of the best movies of the year so far
May 17 2015,negative,this movie is horrible we sat through half the movie and left  we asked frank theaters for our money back or a credit and of course they said no  dont go to frank theater in york paif you dont like the movie you cant get a refund  bad movie poorly written
May 17 2015,negative,recently i attended a 410 pm est showing of the newest addition to the mad max syndicate fury road on opening day in a major us city  and i fucking hated it  it was stupid boring poorly written poorly acted tom hardy can be given a hall pass simply because he was given one of the most parse and retarded scripts in cinematic history disgusting cinematographically impressive i give it credit for that weird not at all entertaining and to get top the crux of this editorial misogynistic  it contained nothing of the awesomeness that defined our stillpenalty boxed mel gibson in the original mad max films  this movie defined misogyny to a t and the fact that im reading online opinion pieces that state it was promulgating a feminist agenda means that theres a very bright side to the release of this movie for those who wish they could have seen what cultural values would have been extant had the confederacy won the us civil war so many years ago or what the world would look like had the nazis conquered all in world war ii or how things would have turned out if stalin found a revvedup political heir with the same aggressive purgepolicy mindset of the 1950s you might have a front row seat soon  im going to discuss that ideation in depth below along an overarching track of a scathing review of this movieit will be the only negative review that exists anywhere on the internet as far as i know so soak it all up while its hot    before i go any further id like to establish several prefects of my existence which will be salient to the following opinions  first i am a successful very white moderately athletic traditionally goodlooking male i am over six feet tall i attended prep school and then went to an overpriced liberal arts college  since i graduated from my university a decade ago ive been working in the investment banking community primarily  again  in major us cities  this is salient because it embodies a paradigm of existence and to an extent highlights that ive been exposed to a culture that is dominated by a masculine mindset promulgated by other individuals whom on paper are endowed with an education and upbringing similar to my own and have likely led a lifestyle similar to mine  also it allows greater credence when i disclose that ive at times over the past several decades rolled with the creepiest of the creepy  ive hooked up with strippers ive been unappreciative and distant from women ive dated ive said inappropriate shit to girls when im blacked out  im not proud of it and in that vein im sometimes not a good person  im also a christian note therefore a hypocrite too and trying harder to live up to the values delineated by the lord  its not going great though im getting there  but after seeing the latest mad max installment and fleshing through some of the opinions written about it online i rest assured ill have the rest of the world or at least a solid portion as company if should ever come to pass that the seventh circle of hell exists  second i am a movie buff  in between cocaine lines and highpriced hookers kidding i enjoy watching films for their artistic and cultural value  if i ever make enough money that i no longer have to suck my bosses dicks kidding to make partner at my firm and therefore no longer have to put in 15 hour days i may retire and actually finish some of my screenplays  my favorite film genre is likely thriller or action movies from the early 1990s  i love schwarzenegger  michael douglas is one of the greatest actors of all time  if i could have loitered the set of any film it would likely be paul verhoevens 1991 erotic thriller basic instinct or perhaps steven soderbergs 2000 piece traffic  truly i would have happily skipped the filming of the nude scenes with sharon stone just to see the thrilling sequences of michael douglas channeling a cocaineridden alcoholic trigger happy cop in san franciscoa character that likely came very naturally to him  more recently i loved interstellar  i loved promethus  scifi appeals to me  blackhawk down was awesome  elsewhere in the wartime genre the hurt locker ruled  terminator 2 judgement dayagain getting back to a bygone eramight be my favorite movie of all time  so let it be known that not only am i a movie buff but i like actionpacked movies  that gets most of my background out of the way  now back to the 2015 mad max sequel  i arrived at the theater after departing from work early even for friday  i purchased my ticket for a spot in the middle of the theater and felt at home in nearlyfullreclining stadium style seats kept company by a craft beer and small popcorn slathered in act iii preservativesasbutter  i was very happy and very comfortable watching the previews  as the film commenced within seconds the thought entered my head what in the fuck am i watching  as we got further into the piece the thought persisted no really what the fuck am i watching and what the fuck is going on here  is anyone else here just sort of creeped out by these opening sequences and confused as fuck like 20 minutes in  how in the fuck did this movie get greenlighted  maybe i was just tired after a long work week but i could barely follow the plot for the first 30 minutes  and it wasnt the intriguing confusion elicited by the suspensethriller film genre it was more like i accidently let all of the blotter acid fall into my beer as opposed to the few tabs that i intended  finally i began to understand some semblance of what was going on when an admittedly beautiful nearly naked white women crawled up from underneath charlize therons war rig  a war rig is essentially a gas truck with the chevron logo wiped away by years of weird bald men driving it around after doing a lot of chemical inhalants leftover from the world as it used to be  why the hell the war rig title wasnt designated to the bad guys bullet proof monster truck with cannons and shit mounted on top is beyond my ken but thats the case  charlize theron was freeing a bunch of hot women who were breederswivesslaves from the bad guy  in this case the bad guy is an old dude who has some sort of postapocalyptic breathing apparatus and whose body is covered in unexplained boils that required the medical prescription of a small child blowing dust on them at the beginning of the filmim not kidding  it was fucking stupid  he also somehow controls most of the water that remains in this postapocalyptic world and wastes a lot of it by releasing it in large bursts from some sort of aqueduct system on top of a mountain in the middle of nowhere in the australian desert  fucking stupid  on top of his lack of respect for natural resources which are few and far between in this future i fail to see how just dousing his constituency in water for a few minutes every day enables them to survive  it seems to me theyd actually have to be able to drink some  but these are apparently questions that you are supposed to think and then keep to yourself and move on  so this pregnant white woman crawling through the war rig is not alone  she has a bunch of friends as company in an underground hidden compartment in charlize therons gas truck  they are all hot  two of them are even pregnant with bad guys babieslucky him child support likely doesnt exist after the nukes have gone off  except for the fact we find out these women are his slaves so even if he missed one or two baby mama payments there wouldnt be anything they could have done about it  unlucky for the lady whos coming to term she gets hit in the head by a car chasing charlizes war rig  she dies just like that  these bad guys must have been bible thumping prolifers because one of the henchman after night has fallen just goes fist deep in this woman and pulls the baby right out  keep in mind through all of this the woman is dead  because they nailed her in the head with a car and sent her flying  but no one really seemed to care about this  all they care about is that she has a baby and its a boy  but wait plot twistthe baby is dead too  again no one really seems to care that the baby is deadthe makeshift obgyn even takes the umbilical cord and twirls it around his fingers for a second  can you imagine how disgusting it would be to do that with an umbilical cord  much less what your thoughts would have to be about the dead mother and infant youve essentially just violated  he doesnt have a care in the world though and seems content to just do a lot of yelling with the rest of the band of villains  okay so finally after a lot of chasing tom hardy charlize theron and all these hot chicks lose the bad guys and arrive at some stupid location charlize calls the green placeher childhood home from where she was stolen according to the asinine script  and they find all these old women marauding around on dirt bikes  but before the geezers are revealed there is yet another youthful fully naked hot chick in a cage  inside the plot the old women are hiding and they put this young hot chick naked inside a cage to trap potentially hostile groups traveling across the desert  how one might wonder does putting a fully nude woman inside of a cage like an animal empower the image that the public has of the female gender  take a step backwhat would have happened if it were the hundreds of bad guysthe very same who just fucking trucked a pregnant slave woman with their cars a few minutes before killing her and her unborn childwhom had stumbled across this naked women in a cage and her 67 protective guardians all of whom are probably nearing the age of necessary dialysis  those bad guys would have killed the old women and taken the hot naked one as another slave  they would have impregnated her made her their property as the lead bad guy refers to the chicks he keeps dressed in white linens no water in the future but apparently plenty of bleach to keep the girls outfits nearly pristine in color and impregnates when so chooses  do you want to know what i felt when i saw the darkhaired chick courtney eaton climb out of the truck for the first timeafter i finally understood what was going on and where these women came from  i thought damn she is fine  physically im attracted to darker women and she caught my eye  i didnt wish i could take a fucking time machine back to witness the glory and strength of the womens suffrage movement of the early 20th century  i didnt think to my lucky susan b anthony silver dollar and reflect on the impression she made in history and whisper under my breath well they made it and theyre still going strong only now movie studios and charlize and tom have taken the reins  why did i not feel a magnetic pull to embrace the rights of women  because the darkhaired girl was half naked paraded around in 300hd on a 100 foot wide screen in front of me and was clearly put there to elicit similarly indecent thoughts from dudes like me  said another way i was mildly sexually aroused  and do you know what girls  your boyfriend was sitting next to me thinking the same thing  no way he didnt hes one of the good ones i know my man  im sure he is but hes still a guy  he was probably at halfmast underneath that childs popcorn in his lap that you guys are both allowed to split on cheat days from your paleocrossfit lifestyles  ever seen the pornographic video series big sausage pizza  his thoughts were likely closer to how he could reenact a scene from that collection with the popcorn tub than to anything resembling a ballad to promote opportunity for the girl at his side  sorry to burst your bubble  the crux of the argument that this film promotes a feminist agenda has to lie in the concept that by depicting this future where all the attractive women are breedersslaves whom no one gives two shits about when they kill them and nearly decapitate them with their dune buggy as long as they still have enough to reproducethe crux of that argument has to lie in that the film is trying to paint a dystopic picture of how women could be objectified and subjugated which then encourages people to embrace an antithetical model and give women the respect they deserve  it has to for it is a specious statement at best to suggest that seeing these women kill off some bad guys or witnessing a bunch of geriatric old brawds ride around on dirt bikes and do some damage with their shotguns somehow outweighs all of the disturbing treatment to the female characters at other points in the film and seeing them parade around half nude or full nude  they have an entire room in this movie dedicated to obscenely overweight women why they need to be so morbidly heavy i have no idea who are impregnated so that men can siphon off their breast milk in huge vats to drink laterim not kidding  they even stored some of the milk on charlizes war rig i guess in case someone got thirsty for some bile beverages along the trek across the sweltering desert  tom hardy actually uses the milk to wash his face  they tell mad max that its milk from human mothers and he just proceeds to rub it all over his head  again that is fucking disgustingin any future no matter how vile the living conditions may be but it is also unnecessarily degrading  did i gain anything or did the movie by seeing those women being forced to pump milk out of their boobs so the bad guys could kick back and drink it inside of their mountain lair  no it didnt further anything other than the orgiastic compilation of the insane plot construction that comprises this entire film  all it did was gross me out    and then on top of that the bad guys are just deadthey arent really punished theres still a lot of them chilling around the aqueduct compound at the end of the movie  so their behavior is essentially vindicated once the chase is over  yes they destroyed the lives of several chicks but theyre dead now so no need to reflect any more on their actions  what about all the dudes who didnt die  theyre just free to go and roam around like a bunch of rapey psychotics and do whatever they want still as long as the one who showed them the ropes was killed by tom hardy  i dont even really know how tom hardy killed the guy it looked like it was a chain or something which he managed to winch between the cars that are perennially chasing each other in the desert and cut off part of his face  but im not sure and thats just an asidethe bad guys behavior was never truly condemned it was just insinuated that it was unacceptable and that girls didnt appreciate being slaves but they were still content to wear their hot white linen underwear outfits long into the movie  maybe you cant blame them the australian outback looked really hot id want to be near my skivvies too  but im postulating thats not why they were asked to dress that way for the film  the absolutely batshit crazy thing is that apparently no one else in the world shares this view  its fucking insane to me it makes me feel like jumping out of this lush 3rd floor chelsea flat which i think of myself as a douche for taking out a mortgage on with coinvestors because im not sure im living in the real world and think that when i hit the pavement i might just finally wake up and realize this is a bad dream  but now im starting to think fuck it why is it bad for me to be like this if the rest of world has become so backwards that they call mad max fury road a tribute to female empowerment and lest the rotten tomatoes rating be any guide one of the best movies ever made  are you fucking kidding me  am i the only fucking person in the world who thought any of this  seriously if thats the best movie in america right now if its going to get a fucking 99 critic review on rotten tomatoes trailed only very slightly by audience approval i think we should legalize cocaine and start mixing it in our newborns baby powder  if all it takes to make people happy and designate something as a creative triumph is the theatrical equivalent of a hedonistic fuck orgy comprised of loud sounds crazed and psychotic characters that make no sense and sexually objectified women who in some unknown universe are actually making a feminist statement then we should get little kids on the controlled stimulant train earlier and stop fucking around  why should youths now have to wait to try ecstasy tablets at their first overpriced music festival  why cant we give it to them in their age of ultron lunchbox and tell them that it will make nap time more fun at school  heroins apparently back in business along the east coast give little timmy a safe unused hypodermic needle before he heads to soccer practiceyes please for how will he learn to score goals without some sort of postgame reward  seems to make sense to me  some critic wrote and i paraphrase that charlize theron is the best female action lead since sigourney weaver in alien  fucking really  i loved charlize in monster and movies like the astronauts wife are some of the underappreciated gifts to the avid film goershe did wonders with that movie for what the script was  so should we really be questioning whether she deserves an award for like basically reading off a telemprompter for two hours  wait wait wait she added some flavor to her character by wearing a prostheticrobotic arm that apparently works in a future with no electricity but still allows for scientific advancement far beyond what were capable of today  fucking are you serious    no i admittedly am not a huge fan of these new highbudget brand moviesthe avengers for instance  but the avengers didnt make me question whether id huffed paintchips before arriving at the theater  i have never walked out of a movie beforeand ive seen a lot of movies  but i was seconds fucking seconds away from walking out of that theater in the first 30 minutes  instead i went to get another beer to try to make myself subdued and dumber maybe that initiative worked which was what allowed me to sit through the whole two hours which are two hours of precious life that ill never get back  maybe im just too old having pushed into my 30s  or maybe too many whiskeydiets  i dont know  but im reminded of a quote from george orwells 1984winston proclaims in a moment of heartening epiphany being in a minority even in a minority of one did not make you mad  so forget it  ill die happy in knowing that i put my two pence in even if the rest of the world is fucking crazy  thats all from me
May 17 2015,positive,never takes itself to seriously by adding the downright absurd it reminds us why we love the films and that we are there to have fun
May 17 2015,positive,to call mad max fury road incredible would be an understatement from a badass cast of characters led by tom hardy and charlize theron to amazing visuals and practical stunt work all the way to masterful energetic and visionary direction from 70 yearold george miller this is not only a perfect action film but a perfect film all around if you love action movies or simply love movies in general it is your duty to see mad max fury road 5 out of 5 stars
May 17 2015,positive,max max goes to 12 in the explosively loud action flick geared more to women
May 17 2015,positive,official tylo review for mad max is in     overall it was pretty good though i wasnt blown away like the 90 rotten tomatoes led me to believe i would be that being said as far as action movies go it was pretty great im also making this review without having seen the original it is something on my list to watch though     charlize theron is slowly becoming one of my favorite actresses she did a really good job in this movie i also liked her and tom hardy together as they were a pretty fun team as well     the effects i though were pretty fantastic especially the sandstorm bit i do however get totally immersed into the film unless its just a glaringly obvious visual problem another thing i thought they pulled off well was the lack of unnecessary gore     i like doing a 10 system for movies as 5 i think is too low of a number to judge so for an action movie id give it a 1010 overall id give it about a 710 probably
May 17 2015,positive,just saw this  i want to see it again immediately
May 17 2015,negative,very boring car crashes over and over unclear story and one dimensional characters with a heap of sentimentality thrown in for the dumb audiences miller appeals to
May 17 2015,positive,the cinematography out of this movie was a sraight 1010  yet i really didnt know what to expect from this movie  great action and explosions but something still felt unexplained
May 17 2015,neutral,dragged a little bit possibly over hyped it but was good on the eyes
May 17 2015,positive,ive never seen the original but i really want to see it now to compare really enjoyed this film its weird cooky and fun to watch the carnageand there is plenty of that i didnt actually realise id spent so long in the cinema watching this tom hardy does a few grunts here are there but i felt the main characters were charlize  nicholas the make up department did a fantastic job
May 17 2015,positive,exhilarating absorbing and very pretty to look at this movie is completely insane
May 17 2015,negative,the original mad max had a story this film while spectacular makes no sense whatsoever as it lacks a story
May 17 2015,positive,action packed awesome legendary film
May 17 2015,negative,two hours of unrelenting drivel  no story no characters no substance  oh wait the denouement when max tells us his name with five minutes left i almost forgot   yes the effects are spectacular  but two solid hours of car crashes over and over at a onenote level wore me totally senseless by the end ms theron struggles to give us a character but is given nothing to work with  no humor no wit no charm no surprises no characters  but just like dental work it does finally come to an end
May 17 2015,positive,unrelenting action with little but meaningful dialogue results in an almost perfect action movie amazing location shots and special effects
May 17 2015,positive,very well made a little too weird for my taste
May 17 2015,negative,a blur of stupidity    max  turned into a human blood bag providing whole blood neck to arm for days weeks months even while riding in battle as if it must be continuous without any sense of the many reasons this is impossible    everyone mumbles    story is less about max than women charlize mostly driving the movie rescues 4 other women and only women while racing to a paradise seemingly of only women   the paradise not what she remembered technically would be incapable of supporting life     multiple octagenarian females fighting and beating warriors standing atop a racing vehicle    two hours long 90 of which is racing one way then reversing while outnumbered and outgunned 201 yet surviving then winning     stabbed in the lungs one scene charlze stands tall and strong in the next     six to eight people walked out of the theater and 1215 demanded and received money back from the manager afterwards    rt has dropped its rating by viewers from 99 to 92 since thursday
May 17 2015,positive,best movie this year
May 17 2015,positive,a movie with true grit it showcases hardships to both men and women and allows the male and perhaps more importantly female cast to respond in measure     it shows us that everyone can and should be afforded an opportunity to determine their fate revel in the badassery that is max and furiosa equal parts amazing and cleverly brutal a cinematic marvel whether their paths cross in the future or not let this not be the end of furiosa or mad max on the big screen
May 17 2015,positive,exhilirating breathless inventive and gripping everything you crave from these sort of movies this is movie making at its finest raw action the stunts are incredible the performances perfect the direction masterful this film changes filmmaking like gravity started to little story or characterisation is in the movie but believe it or not these are positives as it would only slow down the pace this is tension to the max and the film to beat of 2015
May 17 2015,positive,yes yesyes and more yes
May 17 2015,positive,i have never seen an action movie before that was ever able to sustain this level of intensity for 2hours hats off to george miller charlize theron  tom hardy 
May 17 2015,positive,simply and amazing film every frame was like a beautiful painting on its own
May 17 2015,positive,perhaps this is my favorite movie i have ever seen  i saw it in 3d and this was jots nonstop action and was very fun without furiosa this movie would have been nothing i want to see this again and definitely want to buy this on dvd this is a mustsee and i am so confused how pitch perfect 2 got an a while mad max got a b also there is an emotional scene and you actually care for the characters furious a must be in the next mad max movie
May 17 2015,positive,one of the best movies ive ever seen
May 17 2015,positive,it is what a person wants from mad max  an event in life that is mad  if i had to sum it up  post apocalyptic heavy metal opera
May 17 2015,positive,good visualsbut the plot iserrrr not there
May 17 2015,positive,this is the rare action movie you want to go watch again in the theatres hardy doesnt have to do much and he does it well theron shines the cinematography and camera angles and design are amazing it all helps to bring it all together providing the sense of raw desperation and shear willpower involved in this crazy desperate world possibly the best action movie ever yes especially if you were to limit the term action movie cause this is a purebreed definitely up there with my favorites like predator battle royale etc
May 17 2015,positive,this film is so amazing 1010
May 17 2015,positive,mad max fury road tears the leather off the baseball with a very unexpected and delightful turn from the mainstream of hollywood movies in 2015  while its absurdity overshadows much of the film there is a surprisingly good plot filled with just enough dialogue to actually give this film heft instead of sitting in a theater to watch mindless violence for two hours    the real bulk of the film lies in the car chases and wheelbased combat hence the fury road  pretty much from the opening scene after some exposition from tom hardy the film is basically one long car chase broken up expertly at certain times so as to not completely blow the viewer through their chairs      these postapocalyptic movies always try and explain too heavily how the world got to the point it did but fury road circumvents this by showing rather than telling  because that big question isnt really answered in a straightforward manner and because we never really get a true background story for max george miller puts that part of the movie into our hands to create    while tom hardy is billed as the top actor in the film and believe me hes nailed the role of hardass with a combination of many of his characters hes played before charlize theron comes out the real star as onearmed furiosa  along with immorten joe who was the original bad guy from the first film but a different character and nicolas hoult as a war boy this cast is ripe with talent      i saw it in 3d not because i wanted to but because i looked at the wrong times and it wasnt worth it  dont bother  catch this in all its glory on a normal screen and you wont be disappointed to rocking out along with the rest of the audience from beginning to end
May 17 2015,positive,amazing on all levels just dont wait 30 yrs to make another one but also take some time to make a good one
May 17 2015,positive,mad max fury road is a terrific and refreshing action movie it has the ability to please any type of audience and leave them wanting more
May 17 2015,negative,went to watch this movie based on the positive reviewswhat a waste of time  they drive to the desert and back again blowing up everything in sightthis is not a plot  rubbish
May 17 2015,positive,excuse me while i throw all the awards to this epic best action film i have seen ever
May 17 2015,positive,visually stunning and absolutely insane
May 17 2015,positive,mad max fury road follow on from the original mad max trilogy and its up to tom hardy to fulfil the role portrayed by mel gibson   loneliness is the best form of survival according to max as max survives and escapes the torment of a group of warlords his company turns into assisting and keeping safe a group of females led by an imperator furiosa theron   action packed along the trail of fury road in an attempt to keep everyone safe and protect humanity full of action george millers attempt is most destructive and graphic all the while being very visually grand just too much to focus on for my liking nice follow on but not a patch on originals im afraid
May 17 2015,positive,best movie of 2015 so far
May 17 2015,positive,a really exciting movie from start to finish one chase scene after another either on foot or on the road but even with all the action there is an underlying plot that is actually quite compelling all the characters are looking for redemption in some way and some of them may find it
May 17 2015,positive,worldclass music stunning visuals great action sequences mad decent plot and a star studded cast make mad max fury road one of the best movies in recent memory
May 17 2015,positive,mad max fury road is not a movie it is a gift to all of humanity
May 17 2015,positive,fantastic action and stunts max is back
May 17 2015,positive,awesome action that incorporates enough of the fist movies in the series to make you feel like you didnt miss a day in their world the vehicles were sweet and the action never ending
May 17 2015,positive,seen it twice now the second time in 3d its a cant miss either way its a little tough to follow the story particularly at the beginning but there definitely is one max winds up as a live bloodtransfusion donor for a warboy after his capture which explains why hes strapped to a car in the first big chase sequence you wont get a lot of exposition at any point but consistent thought went into the writing which is one of the things that separates fury road from any action movie done oh ever best 3d ive ever seen makes everything else look like the cartoons they are im looking at you fast  furious and avengers in this movie the action has stakes the consequences are real and the cinematography is of the very best caliber see this movie
May 17 2015,positive,this movie is one of the best so far that i have seen in 2015 better than avengers in my opinion
May 17 2015,positive,got to find me the sound track to this
May 17 2015,positive,over rated movie mad max hardly spoke  just a little to weird and not a very good plot
May 17 2015,neutral,the story is not very good the action is really good but it feels like alot of the same the ending is disappointing
May 17 2015,positive,you    yeahyou  just shut up for once about your first world problems and go see this today 
May 17 2015,positive,apocalypse on steroids the fact that their is a weak plot is overshadowed by exceptional special effects including amazing vehicles and chases if you loved the original series you may be a bit disappointed
May 17 2015,positive,the best film i have seen a long time if you havent you must
May 17 2015,positive,it took me a few hours to remember to breathe and a nights sleep to let it stew but now i can confidently say max max fury road is one of the best action movies of all time main factors its reliance on shownottell world building with almost no exposition and the editings dedication to the mission of crafting highoctaine allpursuitallthetime desperation while resisting the urge to indulge in any of the directors hundreds of other noteworthy ideas
May 17 2015,neutral,mad max fury road is loud grotesque violent lacking in story and overall disturbingly unfulfilling it boasts a couple of thrilling action sequences and some good performances but it seems as though anyone could play these onedimensional characters
May 17 2015,neutral,wasnt keen on the story good actors but poor script very different from original
May 17 2015,positive,you can see it as a crazy overthetop car chase through the desert a well made cool looking car chase thats fun to watch but a just a car chase none the less and thats not a bad thing  or you can see that miller using astounding technical work an overwhelming imagination and breathtaking stunts and effects makes sure that fury road can seemingly only be described with one word extreme  extreme sounds extreme cars extreme violence extreme characters extreme colors extreme guitar guy extreme disgust extreme desperation  extreme despair extreme depravity to every degree he exaggerates this chaotic sometimes disturbing world we live in but miller also lets spark another idea a small one that somehow shines in this barrage of extremes this mad mad idea of hope
May 17 2015,positive,one of best movies this year  ambitious production  extremely intense  extravaganza stunts show  charlizes performance is at her top notch  story with a heart  i cried  who killed the world  george and charlize did  watched in 3d was worth it
May 17 2015,positive,has a similar singularity of vision as dredd and though it doesnt quite hit the high of that film it comes very close when so many films try so hard to be tricksy this is refreshingly blunt and violent like an ice cold hammer to the chin  the world is wonderfully realised with highly contrasting vivid colours looking as spectacular as the stunts it also sounds incredible  obviously the action is riveting and never boring despite how much of it there is  i hope we get to set plenty more of this world
May 17 2015,positive,just as entertaining and full of action as the road warrior it is skillfully made and full of amazing effects    i believe set after the events of thunderdome max has wandered off into another tale of road warriors
May 17 2015,positive,mad max fury road is an insanity sandwich piled high with slices of the brains of sergio leone david lynch george rr martin iron maiden and cirque du soliel between two buttered slices of charred rat fink toast chefed by a huffedup heironymus bosch while listening to jesus built my hotrod by ministry in front of a twostory marshall stack its as if someone gave heath ledgers joker 50 million and a nuclear bomb and told him to make a buddy movie it makes cgdriven comic book movies like the age of ultron look like an episode of jimmy neutron it is batshit crazy in its epic scale the topthis bravura of its stunts and narrative imagination and in the tiniest details like the smiley faces drawn on the radiation boils that are slowly killing a protagonist it will change the action picture game for decades influencing the next generation of wannabees and fill directors whove come to rely on cg with ice water fear for their careers the production design must win every award this year it will melt your face if you measure glee in movies by the number of moments when the audacity of the vision leaves you no other choice but to just laugh outloud this is your next movie
May 17 2015,positive,this movie is worth every bit of hype that is circulating out there since its release on friday i saw the comiccon preview last year which was stunning and i kid you not aweinspiring since then ive been ardently awaiting the release of this movie steering away from the negativity that remakes these days sprout finally it was released immediately an unforeseen amount of good reviews served to pump some adrenaline into my already eager state to the point where i became impatient many began to complain about a predicted ridiculous amount of cgi used when they had yet to see the movie and when that was countered i was encouraged to see it 3d which i gleefully did it was also not a remake but a reboot thank goodness its a movie which you would be able to understand without watching the other three movies of mad max and not have to ask em i supposed to know who that is and how they know each other  in the end i was going to watch this movie anyway whether in theaters or not and i should mention that i havent watched a movie after its release in theaters since ice age 3 because im usually not interested great reviews hot wordofmouth spreading minor use of cgi not a remake and a strong female lead with the craziest of stunts and rich world are what made me all the more exhilarated enraptured and amazed by this film   i loved it even in the moments when it almost seemed excessive and i had to stifle a small giggle its worthy of every praise and i will encourage all those i can to watch it
May 17 2015,negative,this movie although visually stunning was not about mad max at all i really loved the stunts in the movie very nice action the story line was horrible and they could of lost the mothers milk part which was very weird mel gibsons mad max is still tops in my opinion because  it was about max not other characters  the movie actually did not show much of max in action the actors were good but the storyline sucked 
May 17 2015,positive,awesome heavy metal dystopian chase and we have a darth vader variant in this one be warned you will have a few moments across the film to take your breaths
May 17 2015,negative,just all around awful too much wildness on car design not about max at all mainly about furiousa its a feminist action movie for guys and just doesnt work awful writing no interceptor except in the beginning not about survival how can any of you say this movie was good outlandish action that cant ever possibly happen a supercharger got pulled off of an engine by hand why cant we just have a movie about max his dog and his car surviving in the wasteland just all around bad movie save yourself 2 hours of nonsense
May 17 2015,neutral,very shallow movie with barely a story and too much action  certainly a lot of attention to detail but very niche movie
May 17 2015,negative,i guess its just not my kind of movie
May 17 2015,positive,george miller makes michael bay look like an amateur when it comes to directing action scenes this movie was blissfully over the top in its action the acting was actually pretty good if i say so myself not to mention there where some awesome characters throughout the movie im looking at you charlize theron and flamethrowing guitar player also the writing i have to say was actually well done on every count tom hardy was fine its the new max but hes no mel gibson
May 17 2015,positive,fav movie of the year so far
May 17 2015,positive,i liked it very much very creative and all the design work was worth the effort and very successful the story and dialogue was on a higher level then the previous films but then it is 2015
May 17 2015,positive,its not perfect but the entertainment value and technical achievements of the action sequences outweigh any of its very minor flaws
May 17 2015,positive,amazing special effects and thats it this film would have done well to keep gibson as the one and only max and its not my intention to badmouth hardy but he is in no way max he doesnt have the presence to convey the the heartbreak outrage guilt and insanity caged behind the eyes of a father and husband who holds them at bay with quick wit and sarcasm not caring if he lives or dies he wants nothing more than for his family to embrace him and tell him it was all a bad dream  everything else is just in the way hardy as much as i love his work plays as a man who is guilt ridden but is living to survive not to make those that would visit such horrors upon his family or anyone elses pay sorry as i am to say it this movie didnt even need max in it it plays more like mad max prozac road with him in it the cast with the exception of hugh keaysbyrne who played the original villain from mad max and theron who stood out indeed all carried their weight why this film was this film rated r is beyond me you didnt get to see anyting outside of explosions and people in weird masks fighting that warranted an r rating im no fan of gore and liked the way it was shot im just curious the chronicles of narnia was more violent and just in case you missed it tom hardy is not mad max mel gibson is and always will be fury road for all of its great effects is beyond thunderdome with the unhinged gibson being replaced by a melancholy sometimes angry and haunted tom hardy the ever luscious tina turner being updated to an impossibly stunning charlize theron
May 17 2015,positive,amazing action ruined by crap picture and sound at cineworld
May 17 2015,positive,best movie of the year
May 17 2015,positive,two hour car wreckage rollercoaster that entertains you a lot
May 17 2015,positive,mad max fury road  why is it so good   answer at first glance this movie seems to be a transformers on wheels in the desert but saying that would be like comparing apples to oranges what first struck me was the incredible scenery costume design and all around incredible postapocalyptic atmosphere george miller was able to create every little thing is made to look a hundred years old or rusting and its in a strange way beautiful to look at no recent movie has been able to grasp this sense of atmosphere quite like this secondly the authentic feeling action one might remember the lord of the rings trilogy and how a great deal of the orcs were costumed actors and it looked and felt great for viewers then came the hobbit where every single orc was cgi causing the movies to lose a lot of their creative and inventive roots fury road brings us back to the lotr days where yes theres is cgi but there is just so much real noncgi action taking place that it causes the viewer to be significantly enthralled in the literal nonstop action sequences thirdly the cinematography was spectacular done like a tarrentino film the shots are fast paced chaotic but methodical making the action feel more put simply flat out fun plus having a plain bad ass like tom hardy as the head and equally talented cherlize theron by his side make for a great time in conclusion the masterfully created atmosphere authentic feeling action and outstanding cinematography of fury road make fast and furious look and feel like the love bug all together its a crazy molotov cocktail of a movie and a hell of a good time
May 17 2015,positive,potential for greatness that fell short due to cheesy acting
May 17 2015,positive,absolutely badass one of the best action movies of our generation
May 17 2015,positive,it is in a way to mad max 2 what that has been to mad max 1  an even more simplified and streamlined plot in favour of bigger crazier more overthetop action and even less pretence that the world can logically exist it is to science fiction what mythology is to historyits not supposed to make sense its supposed to be beautiful and boy is it beautiful
May 17 2015,positive,really action movie  love you so much 
May 17 2015,positive,i had to pick my jaw up from the floor a few times
May 17 2015,negative,what a waste of money and time  the absolute worst film to be made in the history of man avoid avoid avoid  
May 17 2015,positive,a nice and entertaining return to practical effects hy hope is that future directors will take notice and realize you can make an extremely effective action movie without using shaky camera or overindulge on the cgi  go and see this if you long for the days of old school action and action done right  consider this  the antiavengers movie of the summer
May 17 2015,negative,unless youre a 15year old boy or you just simply have no curiosity this is a bad movie period how could this be considered mad max compared to the other movies in this franchise this one is a throwawaytotal trash as a standalone movie its just bad
May 17 2015,negative,about as good and envolving as the mummy returns
May 17 2015,positive,everyone is loving on george millers mad max fury road and i am no exception  well ok maybe slightly  dont get me wrong here this was a beautiful movie artfully shot gorgeously colored and the production design was beyond impeccable but what about the script it wasnt idiotic perhaps but it certainly wasnt sophisticated the plot left much to be desired the characters backstories were over the top and heavy handed and yes it matched the grind house cinema feel that we all committed to when we decided to go see mad max but it required so little of me as a viewer it didnt challenge me or make me feel something deep or cathartic it was badass and if thats all it set out to be then it is a resounding success but part of me feels like the bar is slipping throw enough trash at us in a row and george millers film is 98 fresh on rt but is this always the standard we had set id like to think not  still go see mad max its a blast and a half
May 17 2015,positive,definitely a mustsee on the big screen well choreographed stunts and superb direction
May 17 2015,negative,you will see some polar division in opinion on this film most people like it a few despise it basically this movie has no point its just a bunch of action scenes masquerading as a film if you want to see one long boring sequential selection of action scenes that runs for like two hours go ahead but this film is legitimately plotless also hardy cannot consistently deliver any one accent australian british or american and his performance bites this movie would have been better if the film actually had been the feminist mad maxine people have claimed it is actually pretty much any change would have been positive just as long as it produced characters a plot a point anything this is a desolate film its michael bay for a slightly different crowd
May 17 2015,positive,pure mad max fun start to finish its a thrillride love the fact that the vast majority of shots are incamera  so much better than cg this movie is meant to be seen on the big screen and its why we still go to movies  watched it in 2d not 3d  best action movie in years
May 17 2015,positive,we just saw this in 3d last night dont worry about the plot  just revel in the amazing driving sequences the victoria secret models riding along and the aluminum painthuffing skinheads were great for a laugh definitely a mustsee for the theater
May 17 2015,negative,too much violence stupid story bad acting mad max cant even speak
May 17 2015,positive,wow if you like crazy nonstop action wild looking characters fantastic high speed stunts and grand explosions then youll love mad max i know i did
May 17 2015,negative,why do they need to make a feminist action movie for guys look at the success of american sniper and leave out the liberal politics
May 17 2015,positive,i love when a movie creates a whole mythos around its universe it feels more real
May 17 2015,positive,i just went skydiving but i didnt actually jump out of a plane i just saw mad max fury road which i can only assume will be the closest simulation to skydiving i will ever experience unless i go skydiving for real one day the rush this movie gave me is indescribable    a masterpiece is the word ill use to describe this film its a fucking action masterpiece if ive ever seen one its extraordinary everything about this movie is great the direction performances visuals score costumes and of course the action were all astounding i am now weary to go out and see the other action films coming out this summer because i dont think anything will even come close to this ill be comparing other action movies to this film for years to come i am so giddy right now my blood pressure is still through the roof    mad max fury road is an adrenaline filled nonstop badass vehicular action extravaganza george miller is 70 years old and hes created the best action movie to come out in many years ive seen several people complain about character development and how they didnt care about anyone i truly dont understand how anyone could feel that way in my opinion the character development was damn good especially considering how much of the runtime is action miller was able to create genuine character development in between some of the best action sequences youll ever see personally i cared what happened to our protagonists when they were in danger the entire film i was on the edge of my seat biting my nails    charlize theron portrayal of furiosa might be the most bad ass female ive ever seen put on screen shes certainly the best since sigourney weaver in alien tom hardy is the absolute man he is the definition of the term badass this man has played a deranged criminal locked up in solitary confinement a boxer batmans nemesis and now a mad road warrior what cant this man do he absolutely owns everything he does    movies like this arent made anymore and its so refreshing to see one essentially come out of nowhere    have a lovely day 
May 17 2015,positive,alright fast and had its funny moments
May 17 2015,positive,all out action without a chance 2 take a breather  come 2 think if it it is its weakness no space 4 drama it doesnt have an origin of y mad max is mad just little glimpse that gives u a general idea which makes u dig up mel gibsons original version 4 reference the action sequence r amazing  the music soundtrack is booming i mean the bad guys literally bring the soundtrack music with them drum beats  a rocking guitar this is not 4 the faint of heart  4 the medical explanations of blood transfusions  how can anyone survive that dreaded view of the bleak futurebeats me
May 17 2015,positive,i went in thirsty when the credits started to roll i had not yet opened the bottle
May 17 2015,positive,furiosa fury road    they captured the look and feel of the mad max world very well what was lacking was any acting from max tom hardy he did a good job in the fight sequences but grunted his way through everything else this movie should have been called furiosa charlize theron because it was really her story and she was by far the better actor
May 17 2015,positive,90 plus i dont think so it was well done but i dont really want to see it again i guess after reading and hearing it was one of the or the greatest action movies ever my expectations were too high it is certainly not the best im losing faith in filmmaking  well maybe not the filmmakers but the audience
May 17 2015,positive,intense action packed not for the faint of heart charlize theron disappears into her character effortlessly  do not take any child under 13  will have you on your edge of your seat
May 17 2015,positive,a very well done artistic movie in my opinion more entertaining and better written car action movie than fast 7
May 17 2015,positive,mad max is back now i was a little to young and sheltered when the previous mad max movies were at the height of their popularity so i knew nothing of the history or the character or the stories going into this one but enjoyed it just the same the plot of the film is pretty simple imperator furiosa charlize theron is running a seemingly simple gas exchange with a local town for her tyrannical leader immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne she suddenly veers off course with her own agenda and joe sends a pursuit party out after her among them is nux nicholas holt who is one of joes war boys and his blood bag the titular mad max who is along for the ride somewhat unwillingly the rest is a two hour chase that has you on the edge of your seat    things i really liked    charlize theron theron may not be the title character but she is truly the protagonist imperator furiosa is such a powerful and interesting character that you cant help but constantly be rooting for her even sometimes against max as a result the work she does in both the quiet moments as well as the actions packed ones keeps that fire and she is dynamic and captivating right out of the gate i found myself enjoying her much more than tom hardys mad max not to say it wasnt good but she was much better she truly steals the film and if they make a spinoff about furiosa ill be one of the first ones to see it    the world and mythology the world that george miller has created is incredibly interesting i loved how the technology from the cars to the guns to the various machines and the clothing and the character designs told so many stories without some of them uttering single words the guitarist pictured is one of the most striking moments but all of the characters and elements are crafted in such a way that you can tell that miller had designed a world far bigger and grander than what we were shown and i hope he gets to expand upon it in the near future because i would love to hear those stories    the action this is above all else a scifi action film and boy does the action deliver the stunt driving the fight choreography the explosions the visual effects they all look so cool and just when you think then cant go any bigger they do something extreme that goes beyond the previous work i found that this as an action movie far outdid many things that have come out recently and makes it standout and really allows you to take it in and enjoy it    things i didnt like as much    the cinematography and editing now it wasnt all bad but the cuts and sweeps were sometimes so fast that you have a hard time keeping track of all the players on the board you think furiosa is being chased by 4 motor cycles and then suddenly there are three more that appear out of nowhere it was a lot of time where you are confused by the magnitude of the pursuing force and i think some of that could have been solved by taking the time to let us count the players    the lack of background the characters all were crafted in ways that showed history and intrigued me as a viewer but i felt like there were moments where i just didnt understand something about them this was especially true with max and maybe it is because i havent seen the previous films but i had a hard time following the background that was introduced in this film and it made me wonder and removed my focus from what was happening for brief moments    overall overall the film is a monster it comes right at you and doesnt let you go for more than seconds at a time visually the film is incredibly interesting the characters are all fascinating and the story is simple yet nuanced i had a fantastic time watching this and it made me want to go and visit the older movies to see how they tie into this one i would recommend this for anyone who enjoys action films scifi worlds and great acting performances within those types of movies
May 17 2015,negative,i am still baffling at how this film has gotten such rave reviews it is not about mad max furiosa is the main character and there is no actual story to this film we get explosions action falling climbing yelling screaming violence falling crashing crashes fighting violence more explosions and guitar zombies it is basically one long chase scene that is it nothing more and furiosa rules all mad max is just so watered down and pointless and tom hardy hasnt put his all in this role and the lack of chemistry between the actors it makes no sense that these same critics hated age of ultron for all the same reasons they loved fury road
May 17 2015,positive,best action movie in ages i thought the trailer would spoil the movie but boy was i wrong whats shown on the trailer is probably covered within the first 10 minutes the first car chase is probably one of the best in any movie and its probably the worst part of this movie
May 17 2015,positive,an aplus bmovie that at times feels almost like a tone poem to early80s excess a cross between a monstertruck rally and a plasmatics concert a gorgeous scrapmetal demolition derby of a popcorn picture
May 17 2015,positive,a powerful show plenty of action colours sounds and spectacle mad max fury road is like that incredible theatre play in which the narrative is intertwined with an incredible staging with a crude and beautiful morality at the same time this film is close to be a masterpiece in some ways it reminded me of the lion king because of its powerful structure and imaginative inventions when a film reminds you of a masterpiece it does not necessarily mean it is that but it can show you how tremendous it can be
May 17 2015,positive,my review of mad max fury road is so brilliant and fantastic film including stunts with car crashes it is a phenomenon movie you need to see the story is max is captured by group of freaks who trying control there lands when woman named furiosa played by wonderful charlize theron is her best ever to save group of women to find greenland for food and waterthis movie so fantastic and wonderful filming by george miller with stuntsactionand effects and story well done performance also tom hardy as max this is my favorite movie and of the year need to see it that my two cents see yea
May 17 2015,positive,what a lovely lovely film
May 17 2015,positive,luved itwould watch it over n over againits a must ci grew up with the original mad max n it may in my opinion it may have  top themtrue story ãtmãtm
May 17 2015,positive,well that did it for me i dont need to ever see another movie ever again  i always complained about the glass being half full with films lately but this movie pretty much filled it up and than smashed it over my skull now i have no more desire for any other film   i am now going outside indefinitely
May 17 2015,positive,a breathtaking action film with spectacular visuals stunts and strong performances from all involved while my only complaint would be that max had no character development or was borderline 2dimenstional but that can easily be forgiven as he has had 3 other films devoted to his character and the rest of the characters used the extra time for their developments just a fantastic filmand the best dbox experience to date
May 17 2015,positive,all i can say is crazy amazing
May 17 2015,negative,this was the worst movie i have ever scene no story line just chases through the desert and pregnant runner ups from americas next starved model i almost signed up for acting classes from the university of phoenix after having to sit through this steamy pile of regurgitated wendys
May 17 2015,positive,visualy amazing but the story was weak still a must watch
May 17 2015,positive,fantastic and relentless practical effects and all cohesive i hope hell gear up for a sequel because i want more easily the best thing to ever come out of the franchise my favorite action movie since john wick
May 17 2015,negative,if you want mindless destruction and no storyline then this movie is for youif youre wanting to see a good movie then see something else
May 17 2015,positive,mad max fury road is a weird one  as pure of an action movie as there can be  the imagery is spectacular and the violence is over the top and mostly constant  honestly those are usually phrases i use to describe average or bad movies but in this case its part of the charm    if you are going to see this movie just be certain that you are not late as this movie takes off about 45 seconds into the first scene of the movie and never really lets up during its 2 hour runtime  it establishes good and bad guy motivation early and never waivers  the world is established mostly through the films amazing visuals and almost never waivers into exposition     in the end the main strength of the movie is its embrace of the ridiculous and overthetop action presented  its fun and doesnt spend much time preaching about the rights and wrongs of the situation and just lets you enjoy the spectacle  you wont sit down to this movie and see an aweinspiring story that is destined to win bestscreenplay come awards season what you will see is a completely true to form action movie that delivers on all of its promises that would holds up to not only its source material but all of the great action movies of the late 70s and 80s    easily the most entertaining movie i have seen in 2015    455
May 17 2015,positive,well my movie season is over after seeing that filmi dont have to see any upcoming film this year after seeing this moviejust kiddingbut i already know what my favorite movie of the year is    mad maxfury road is the newest installment in the mad max seriesthe last film that came out in the mad max series was mad max beyond thunderdomeif you have not seen these filmsi dont know if you even like moviesthe mad max films have influenced a ton of movie directors over the yearsthe first film was a great revenge filmthe road warrior is the best action film from the 80s and quite possibly one of the top five greatest action movies everand beyond thunderdome is an underrated sequel although its nowhere near as entertaining as mad max and mad max 2the road warrior when it was announced that there would be a new mad max filmi got excited and then i saw the trailer for this moviei liked the trailer but i was still skeptical about itall ive got to say is my expectations were blown away after seeing this moviemad maxfury road stars tom hardycharlize theron nicholas hoult and hugh keaysbyrne and is directed by george miller who did the first three mad max films and both of the happy feet films    mad maxfury road follows max who is captured by a group called the war boys and are led by a man who they worship like a religious figuretheres also a woman named furiosa who is escorting these people that she deeply cares about and also is trying to look for her homelandmax is the guy who is caught in the middle of all this and decides to help furiosathe plot reminded me of a video game plot where you come from point a to get to point b while there are enemies after younow in my opinion action movies have died in the past decadesthey are littered with protagonists that we cant root for or are just invincible like supermanrehashed plots from other great filmsand most of all poorly done action scenes with techniques like the shakycamwith this moviegeorge miller has put the modern action movie to shame and has made the best action movie of the decademad maxfury road is absolutely incredible from start to finishi absolutely loved mad maxfury road    the acting in mad maxfury road is greattom hardy is perfect in the role as max and is a great replacement for mel gibsoni think the reason why he was given the role as max is because he looks like a young mel gibson and they do look eerily similarcharlize theron is awesome in this movie as furiosashe is given a lot of character in this movie and she is toughnicholas hoult is also very good in the movie as nux and it was so hard to notice him under all of that makeup he had on himhugh keaysbyrne is very good in his role as the main villain named immortan joe and i found it really sweet that they never showed his face once in the whole moviehugh keaysbyrne also played toecutter in the first mad max film which is a nice treat for fans of the seriesmad maxfury road has great actingand theres other great things in the moviethe characters in this film are excellent and you actually care about themfuriosa is surprisingly the most interesting character in this movie and shes given a lot of depth in her personalityeven the people that furiosa escorts are characters that you care about and they even serve a purpose to the plot instead of just being uselessthey help max and furiosa in many situations theyre in instead of just being theremad maxfury road is also very wellwritten and is the best written mad max film to datethe action in this film is unbelievablewords cannot describe how awesome the action scenes in mad maxfury road werethe action scenes in this movie are how action movies today should bethere is no shakycam to be found in this movie at all and there are many excellent and expansive shots in the action scenesthis movie has the best action scenes of the decade so farthe special effects in mad maxfury road were just incrediblei am a massive fan of practical effects and this movie has so many practical effects in iteven the explosions you see are actually real instead of fake and horrendous looking cgiim just glad that this movie didnt use a lot of cgi and they only used it when they had tothe direction by george miller is excellentthe film is directed very well and george miller directs with carethe cinematography in mad maxfury road is just phenomenal and flawlessas i said earlierthere are many awesome shots and wide angles during the action scenes which is severely lacking in modern action movies todaythe stunts are also fantastic and i cant believe that actual people were doing most of the crazy stunts in this moviethe score by junkie xl is fantastic and im surprised that no one is talking about the score to this movie because it rocksthe final thing i liked in this movie was just how much insanity there was in itmad maxfury road is just pure insanity and chaostheres a guy in this movie that rides on a giant truck and plays an electric guitar with flames shooting out of the neck of the guitarif you dont think thats insanei dont know what you think is insane    overallmad maxfury road is an incredible film from start to

cinematography is beautifulthe stunts are greatthe score rocksand the movie is just pure insanity and chaosthis is the best film of 2015 so far and ill even go as far to say that this movie is one of the best movies of the whole entire decadethis movie is even better mad max 2the road warrior and is the best film in the whole seriesgeorge miller has vigorously brought this series back and i cant wait to see more mad max filmsi highly implore that you see this movie and not make this 2015s dredd or edge of tomorrowif this film bombs at the box office and we dont get anymore sequelsi will lose all hope for humanityjust go see this movie now because i guarantee that you will not be disappointedthis is already my favorite film of 2015 and itll be hard for any film this year to top this     gradea
May 17 2015,negative,this had to be one of the worst movie ive seen i almost walked out in the middle it was so stupid mad max says maybe 10 words in the movie i think this movie was for the contestants of americas next top models to have a job i cant believe that people enjoyed the movie and reviewed it so well i had to add my review dont see it dont waste your money
May 17 2015,positive,a superb action film which has fantastic special effects and action scenes throughout  the vision of this postapocalyptic setting is very detailed and feels authentic with a range of disfigured characters beautiful maidens and a world that looks and feels as though it has died  the music is great and well used adding a bit of tongueincheek to the proceedings  although there isnt much to the plot and the dialogue is minimal this adds to the strong atmosphere everything is just a little bit mad  it also does become a bit repetitive and it lacks some of the impact of the original mad max film but still a thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining film
May 17 2015,positive,action from the start
May 17 2015,positive,one of the best action films ive ever seen quirky fun amazingly filmed loved the lack of cgi cant wait to see again
May 17 2015,positive,nonstop glorious action over the top drama that somehow feels real but doesnt take itself too seriously the bad guys bring their own soundtrack everywhere they go greek tragedy fueled by gas o leeeen
May 17 2015,positive,mad max fury road was the best hollywood feminist propaganda ive ever seen if youre already brainwashed by feminism like i am i highly recommend you go watch people burn what surely amounted to thousands of gallons of gasoline and make outrageous stunts while crumpling tons and tons old junkyard relics into scrap if you arent dont watch it instead watch your dvd of waterworld or whatever at home by yourself dont let fiery explosions and gore emasculate you like some kinda beta
May 17 2015,positive,mad max fury road is a classic action and adventure film  its an exhilarating thrill ride from start to finish    a movie that will remind viewers of the game twisted metal
May 17 2015,positive,i didnt know what to expected since i dont recall ever seeing the other three movies but i did enjoy this movie there was both action and a story this movie has me wanting to explore the other movies in the series
May 17 2015,positive,its not going to win story of the year but it doesnt stop  go see it for what it is an oh shit did you see that type flick
May 17 2015,positive,it has good action scenes but the story sucks
May 17 2015,positive,the mad max icon continues and its quite the spectacle just think the original material plus cirque du soleil on freakin steroids some of the sexiest action sequences ive seen since terminator 2 judgement dayyeah its that good
May 17 2015,positive,this movie is everything anyone could ever want from an action movie never have i seen a movie with so much nonstop action and realistic visual affects this is what i always wanted the fast and furious movies to be this movie is dare i saw mad
May 17 2015,positive,the movie got short compared with the original movie and i am referring in story and violence  this movie has great fx and a good performance from charlize theron  the halflife boy the red headed mother and the old ladies mr  max got too short on his performance   didnt look too rude or too crazy or too sentimental i will describe his performance as a poker face  the action is from beginning to the ends  the story is about mass control via a religion invented by a man and finally revolution and freedom  with a little touch on some details the movie could it be a 5 star movie but certainly is not
May 17 2015,positive,after all the riotous marketing featuring the word mastermind george miller irrefutably proves himself worthy of the title from start to finish mad max fury road is one long chase scene and the pacing is brilliantly handled there is no drag and the story has been woven in a way that both the character development and plot play out fluidly alongside the action which is a wholly remarkable feat i hope michael bays seen this picture because miller pulls off a job that action directors of today need to take note of what of the cast well hes no mel gibson but tom hardy does pretty well as the titular hero  once again thrown into a chaotic situation that requires mutual trust for the survival of himself and the innocents around him although his accent still puzzles me it was some sorta south african english hybrid that had a tinge of russian in there every now and then truly weird stuff but again he does well in the role the real highlight of the film though is charlize theron as imperotar furiousa she plays what you could call a true powerful femalecharacter and thats not because she kicks ass in the movie or is intimidating to watch or because she stands up to oppressive men no its all those things and the fact that  underneath all the toughness  she possesses a very human amount of heartbreak and fear these character weaknesses are of course channeled into her strengths which makes indeed makes her a strong femalecharacter this is what needs to go into the composition of any strong female part strong female parts are not women who are just another black widowish superheroic asskicker that doesnt need a mans help to get the job done but they are everything that is embodied in therons character so thank you george miller for getting that right the guys 70 and hes still taking young hollywood writers and directors to school
May 17 2015,positive,mad max  fury road delivers bombastic but grounded action at a rate that makes other films in the genre seem paltry in comparison
May 17 2015,negative,this was the worst film that ive seen this year i did not appreciate a single bit of it the action was so overthetop that it just felt so tedious and it made me sleepy
May 17 2015,positive,my world is fire oil and breast milk  what a lovely life
May 17 2015,positive,great action not much of a story
May 17 2015,negative,are bad guys too stupid to shoot out tires in the postapocalyptic future    apparently they are    what this movie did was hijack the most thrilling part of the road warrior the big chase scene and essentially made that the entire movie and boy does it get old loud and boring each grotesquely deformed badguy drives or races alongside max and the hot girls waiting for their turn to have a grisly cgi death      i mean seriously if felt like the entire movie was made by a committee of teenage boys who all agreed that plots and stories are for pussies their prime directive instead was to make everything be as gross gnarly and uberviolent as totally possible and so thats what we got      i cant say anymore or ill spoil what little plot this movie has but shouldnt a roadtrip movie at least go from point a to point b      there was however a pretty cool cgi haboob that had multiple tornadoes roaring groaning and churning inside of it which strangely didnt present too much of a problem for any of the drivers racing through as long as they didnt bump directly into a tornado because unlike this movie the tornadoes didnt suck
May 17 2015,positive,very fun movie to watch great stunts and a sense of urgency imperator furiosa is more the center of this film as opposed to the namesake but still a good one  with all the steampunk feel miller should try his hand at that topic in film as his next  genera could be a lot of fun
May 17 2015,positive,a hyperkinetic masterpiece the best science fiction film since the matrix i walked out of the theatre not only exhilarated but also knowing that fury road like the matrix has changed the genre every action film that comes after will be compared to this and nearly all will be found wanting
May 17 2015,positive,the good incredible and insane action movie finally an action movie that looks like it has a decent budget the last one i can remember before this was skyfall or mi ghost protocol the creativity of miller in his cinematography is excellent beautiful and scenic shots throughout it was clear the helicopter cam was used throughout just the pure creativity in the design of the cars in this movie is reason enough to see it theron and hardys acting was excellentbut honestly hoult simply steals the show with his performance he truly was his character     the bad i feel this movie really could have been 20 to 30 minutes longer i wouldnt have complained if this movie was an hour longer charlize and hardy made some choices in their actions that were stupidly abrupt once i realized they were making life altering decisions in a matter of 30 seconds i was just thinking in my mind wait wut perhaps this was just to speed up the pacing of the movie but i felt it was clumsy and awkward secondly im not sure if hardy was the right actor to play max i feel like max is supposed to be more of a badass guy who still has glimpses of feelings hardy just seemed too soft and sensitive in his role i feel daniel craig would have been perfectly suited for max but that probably wouldve exceeded the budget    should i see it yes see it once and then see it again
May 17 2015,positive,insane action sequences i was literally on the edge of my seat
May 17 2015,positive,violent and action packed its an amazing adrenaline ride that doesnt let up id probably watch it only once coz its so stressful but definitely one of the funnest movies ive seen that got me gripping the edge of my seat
May 17 2015,positive,what a lovely day to be a nerd and a mad max fan
May 17 2015,positive,mad max fury road was amazing probably the most intense action ive ever seen in a movie the world they have createdexpanded on from the originals is fantastic i think anyone who is a fan of the originals should go see it in theaters to do it justice madmaxfuryroad 
May 17 2015,positive,best action movie ive seen in years must see
May 17 2015,positive,amazing great movie   action   hope they do more
May 17 2015,positive,a shitload of v8s  inexplicably huge gasoline explosions  boobies  two hours maximum overdrive
May 17 2015,positive,this is the big summer well spring really action movie i have been waiting for i love the mad max movies beyond thunder dome was sort of lame and this one jumps to the head of the pack tom hardy although he only has about 100 spoken lines is terrific the action for the most part live and not cgi is more or less nonstop the movie is one long elaborate chase scene but it all works just great i must admit i had my doubts about charlize theron in an action flic but she is outstanding really not a missed beat in the cast or in the story in my opinion you really need to see this one to believe it highest recommendation
May 17 2015,positive,such a crazy awesome ride of your life sit back  buckle up youre gonna need to     i hope they do a sequel     nux oh what a day what a lovely day     8510
May 17 2015,positive,excellent action packed return to george millers post apocalyptic vision love the fact that almost all the stunts are real
May 17 2015,positive,after a slow start that story with the action and marvellous stunts kicks in this 2015 version is no remake to the 1979 story as it didnt use the revenge story instead it talks about the apocalypse side although tom hardy didnt do as much as mel gibson the supporting cast offered a lot to the film to deliver the story george miller creates a unique vision of an updated mad max with spectacular cinematography otherwise very happy on the way how this story was told in this one gasoline and water are together very precious
May 17 2015,positive,was very good very action packed
May 17 2015,positive,the movie of the decade
May 17 2015,positive,nonstop action thriller with a engaging fast pace story line that will keep you at the edge of your seat the whole time definitely will be one of the movies of the year
May 17 2015,negative,not ever seeing the original mad max i assumed this would be a good action movie i was so disappointed its a story plot that is drawn out 2 hrs drawn out nothing surprising would not recommend
May 17 2015,positive,go and see this on the biggest screen you can find     this is the sort of movie that if you wait to watch it on your lame home setup you are going to spend the rest of your life banging your head on a table while moaning why didnt i see this at the cinema just why     the plot is superficially simple bunch of women escape a tyrant and are pursued through the desert by said tyrant who wants them back but this movie is so fast paced so chock full of offhand humour awesome stunts weird background stuff amazing little details and crazy characters that you dont know where to look and well all have to watch this movie a few times to fully digest the awesomeness that george miller has thrown up on screen     this is a real experience movie you dont watch it you just feel it and are swept along in awe     just go and see it youll be blown away
May 17 2015,neutral,overrated with no plot until half way through movie
May 17 2015,negative,i think tom hardy said only 10 words the entire movie  usually movies have a story
May 17 2015,neutral,this movie was all icing and no cake  complete lack of original ideas or characters i know its part of a franchise but its like being really excited because teletubbies part two came out and tinky winky is still carrying a handbag  beautifully shot and the cgi is amazing but is that any reason for the professional reviewers to rave about it  maybe the huge budget was partly used to ensure their enthusiasm  feminist themes my arse giving a gun to a granny does not equal feminism however charlize was quite good
May 17 2015,positive,feverish and furious a movie fitting for the definition of larger than life so much things going on on screen explosions quirky characters chicks monsters automotive destruction you cant avoid to be overwhelmed an almost nonstop hardpounding pace race more akin to a postatomic iliad than something else high octane me
May 17 2015,positive,visually stunning and insanely over the top in the best kind of way this film took my breath away and showed me things i didnt know a movie could be or do will be seeing it again asap see it now see it on a very large screen
May 17 2015,negative,if you are looking for mad max you are in the wrong place its an ok movie as far as it goes but falls short of it predecessors the title mad max was added just to increase ticket sales i was reading other reviews about this movie and saw crap about feminism and sexual politics who are these people i am no genius but i saw neither in this movie what you get is a road rage fiesta with no real beginning a foggy  middle and an abrupt anticlimactic end i also thing tom hardy was a poor choice for max not that the character added anything to the movie if this is a post apocalyptic world he is mighty well fed and beefy
May 17 2015,positive,best action movie i have ever seen
May 17 2015,negative,awful awful movie lots of action of course but story awful like watching a cartoon
May 17 2015,positive,riproaring facemelting stupid just stupid for no reason
May 17 2015,positive,its a bigger badass beast than the road warrior but clearly is not a better film mad max fury road a brilliantly directed edited and executed and disappointingly a one dimensional visual feast of action that will have you gasping for air as you forget to breathe at times     least interesting of all is tom hardy and his underwritten role of max which could have been play by countless actors to no better no worse success mel was so much better    to other reviewers   stop writing longwinded term papers for your reviewswho cares and will it kill you to hit the return key once in a while and let a simple paragraph breathe so annoying
May 17 2015,positive,70 yesr old george miller directs a mesterpiece of action packed full of colours and visually stunning it s a furious road led by charlize theron who is the real leader and tom hardy cherrs from the guitar men 
May 17 2015,positive,mad max fury road 10 scale rating 90 fantastic     the good quite possibly one of the greatest action films of the last 20 years if not of all time the film retains the gritty tone of the original films but with updated effects and choreography that is mindblowing pulsepounding and edge of your seat action are terms that get thrown around a lot in reviews of films like this one but they are completely appropriate here almost the entirety of the movie is spent on one war rig but there is a certain level of twisted beauty in the simplicity of it all the vehicles are fascinating beasts of twisted metal and gasoline the characters are hopeless yet determined the world itself is barren hot and unforgiving this all sets the tone perfectly as you watch the protagonists struggle through it all in a series of brilliantly designed chases brutal battles and bloody deaths hardy was well cast as the titular mad max grunting and fighting while uttering few words nicholas hoult is unrecognizable as nux one of immortan joes the main villain of the film war boys when hes onscreen he definitely stands out and hoult is becoming quite the character actor the real star of the film however was charlize theron if anyone ever wondered if she could pull off an action film wonder no longer she not only pulls it off but excels entertaining from start to finish mad max fury road is already in the running for best film of 2015     the bad not that it matters too much but the plot is not only paper thin but mostly nonexistent its a small detail but prevents the film from being absolutely perfect aside from that some of the wives who are a plot device that helps drive the film were somewhat annoying and uninteresting
May 17 2015,positive,its one high octane thrill ride  really enjoyed the  action sequences full of  detailed creativity the awesome characters especially nux 
May 17 2015,positive,best action movie since forever
May 17 2015,positive,brilliant addition to the classic franchise that both manages to reboot with a new lead actor while continuing the excellent story  tom hardy fills in for max perfectly rightly playing him as a man of few words but with a dark past  while some complained that is really more of furiosas story wonderfully played by charlize theron they forget max is essentially the mysterious stranger who shows up to reluctantly save the day in each film since the road warrior still the best of the franchise  the rest of the cast is also excellent particularly hugh keaysbyrne as the villainous imortan joe  behind the camera george miller crafts a brutal yet beautiful vision of the apocalypse like one never seen  the action sequences are breathtaking made more so than they were done by real stunt people and crafts a original world complete with its own religion witness me has fast become a popular scifi phrase for a  reason vehicles  costumes joe is a monstrous sight  not just one of the best action movies in years but the best film of 2015
May 17 2015,positive,if you thought that you had seen everything in a screen you were wrong george miller redeem himself with this gargantuan action movie that hides beauty under its own madness and returns faith in cinema inventive in every action scene in all its little details an bizarre and eccentric adventure not for all kind of spectators get into this convoy or die
May 17 2015,positive,absolutely amazing non stop action loved it
May 17 2015,positive,fast paced thrilling action and the actors are outstanding tom hardy is a perfect mad max and charlize theron steals the show as furisoso this film had so much going on its actually worth seeing twice sit back and enjoy this wild ride
May 17 2015,positive,amazing picture and stunning 3d incredible attention to details last movie of my 2015 and one of the best
May 17 2015,negative,visually spectacular but boring chase film
May 17 2015,positive,youll be too busy gorging on the beautiful visuals and drinking in the action sequences to really notice the wafer thin plot  believe the hype  this is the movie all action movies are now rated against   stunning
May 17 2015,positive,the film was a visual spectacle the attention to details was unbelievable hands down my favourite 2015 film
May 17 2015,positive,this movie was beyond amazing i havent seen a film that utterly satisfying in years i could watch this over and over again
May 17 2015,positive,buckle up its gonna melt on your face
May 17 2015,positive,adrenaline fueled action had the cinema in a total trance from beginning to end with its creative visuals and cinematic cinematography
May 17 2015,positive,i was celebrating my eight yearold birthday and my dad took me and my friends to see the road warrior on the big screen i couldnt believe the rrated intensity and ultracool images before me i could barely take it all in and remained a major fan to this day i never dreamed that i would be experiencing the exact same arresting and ecstatic rush almost 35 years later george millers latest installment fury road blows every other postapocalyptic movie through the back wall of the theatre it is an insanely masterful action film where the relentless mayhem kept me gripped exhausted and afraid to blink from start to finish    at one point during the onslaught there was a euphoric moment amidst one of the many epic and overwhelming car chases where the strange beauty of its carnage left me dizzy as if everything that made the original mad max and the entire subgenre work was pumped directly into my bloodstream hitting me with postapocalyptic imagery that teetered on operatic poetry    the casting is impeccable with tom hardy capturing the isolated unapologetic and damaged max to perfection but the character who steals the show is furiosa played by charlize theron her nononsense and toughasnails character is what makes fury road so compelling what shes fighting for brings about a brilliant and muchneeded political subtext the feminist empowerment elevates the testosterone action to a level of social importance thats refreshing in a hollywood blockbuster at one point she collapses on her knees and lets out a primordial cry for mother earth  encapsulating the very essence of postapocalypse charlton heston has nothing on her speaking of feminist subtext even max himself is baptized through mothers milk after finding a glimpse of redemption it is one of many poignant moments in a film filled with allegorical imagery not least of all the suspenseful sequence involving max and furiosas desperate attempt with a dying tree chained to the truck    fittingly for a film called mad max the cinematic experience is truly insane it captures a preexisting world with zero sentimentality nobullshit dialogue and a pacing that never lets up suffice it to say the action set pieces are unparalleled it is as if george miller wanted to apologize for the lack of action in beyond thunderdome here the stunts and intense violence deliver in a way where fans couldnt possibly ask for anything more scifi action fans can rejoice a masterpiece has arrived in all its fury
May 17 2015,positive,wow this movie was amazing i dont usually give 5stars but mad max deserves it and then some pure action non stop edge of your seat amazing i need to watch this again
May 17 2015,positive,ive never seen any of the original mad max films but id always associated them as being rather weird whether that attracted me to this one im not sure but i found myself rather enjoying it considering the bulk of the film just surrounds various attacks on a large hgv vehicle as it goes on what seems like a never ending road trip its amazing how engrossing it was the story is simply an onslaught by a tyrannical ruler and his armies against a woman who has stolen several of his mistresses as she escapes his empire picking up fellow escapee tom hardy on the way they then team up to defend themselves for the duration of the movie the villains are the weirdest bunch of rock and roll killers you will ever see even accompanied by a freaky looking musician to entertain them as they fight to the death i feel like its all a bit random and not got a lot going for it but its just all that bit different that it becomes quite compelling viewing im even intrigued to now watch the other instalments especially given that its got old mrs thunder thighs tina turner in it for good measure  what could go wrong
May 17 2015,positive,nonstop action movie
May 17 2015,positive,one thing is to revive a franchise its another thing to invigorate a new generation into a movie series that has ingenuity violence color and blood charlize theron carries the film in terms of character while hardy bears the burden of the plot taking old and new fans through a shocking and crazed tour of sand sun and tortured brilliance
May 17 2015,positive,great film very exciting and so action packed  will definitely buy it later to watch again  looking forward to the next one in the series i am sure they will do another  i didnt give this five stars but it wont let me change this to 4
May 17 2015,negative,this reboot mad max is a ultra stupid movie that does not deserve the use of mad max title its a b grade movie with tons of money to spend it wants to be an action drama artistic ala sun dance independent style and political all in one movie and fail in all but one granted the action scenes are good but the story line in general the whole show at the end leave a bad taste i wouldnt rec anyone to go to cinema for it unless youre bored nothing to diane money to burn   spoiler up next the worst absolutely worest point of the chnage that was changed is mad max title mad max but in the movie he like the extras being protray like a unless guydogwhy i want explain later  or like the in the original the wolf boy every point that make mad max a great movie was taken away leaving tom hardy with nothing max in the original was mad but innovative none in here all the points that max did in original is pass to furiosa might as well call the movie furiosa in max world and max the master sifu there to give points and help once a while end of story stupid if i want to see a person  tom hardy mad max  grunts likes dogwolf all the way to the end in the movie i would rather spend the day with my family dogs
May 17 2015,positive,george millers return to the renowned mad max franchise not only lives up to the original trilogy but possibly exceeds it
May 17 2015,positive,the story being explained by narrative is slmething that is really unique with the movies that have been released recently it adds a dark tone to the already haunting flashbacks that he suffers and keeps on reminding max of his troubles past the score compliments the movie so well in each scene that it just feels natural and as in your face as it can and should bbe it doesnt shy away from the orchestra score and the metal riffs transitioning from the mellow scenes and the high octane battles and chases the fights scenes are beautifully choreographed and just aspire a sense of awe and appreciation to an already detailed work     in conclusion mad max is really enjoyable and when the first action scene picks up it brings the action to your face with its beautiful choreography and score and does not let up until after the movies climax a total man flick with a strong female protagonist that is deeply enjoyable
May 17 2015,negative,two hours i will never get back max spoke 100 words movie had no plot drove half the movie to turn around and drive again dont sped your hard earned money wait till redbox special effects where good but not worth movie prices i liked the other movies just not this one
May 17 2015,positive,im a skeptic i also dont tend to like action movies    friends on the internet were practically foaming at the mouth about this movie and with a free saturday evening i thoughtwhy not    its very simple  stop what youre doing stop reading these reviews and run to the movie theater and see this film i think i can honestly call it now this is my movie of the year
May 17 2015,positive,a visual feast miller has once again brought to the screen his stunningly unique future there is plenty of totally outrageous violence explosions and stunts
May 17 2015,negative,a millennials equivalent to john wayne tom hardy plays a cagey mute who has to rescue the victoria secret models from their babysdaddy  a kinda post apocalyptic  bane meets beetlejuice character  while there are some actors who portray characters similar to those in the original trilogy they are not quite the characters made rememberable in road warrior  thurderdome  overall it tries to be weird like david lynchs version of dune but just ends up blowing up a lot of dune buggies over and over and over
May 17 2015,positive,such an amazing movie best movie of the year and possibly the decade
May 17 2015,negative,honestly who are all the people giving this such good ratings its trying to keep some of the original feel but it just cant pull it off it just makes no sense on any level
May 17 2015,positive,finally a decent r rated movie to take the kids to  this is what i remember growing up on its great to see a return to this level of cinematic brilliance   this movie is so fantastic it will poke you in the eyes and make you rub them in disbelief  the cars have as much character as the actors if not more sometimes  this movie is a good thing  george miller i salute you
May 17 2015,positive,im mostly speechless i definitely go and see this again explosive return after 30 years this will set a bench mark how these films should be made
May 17 2015,positive,mad max fury road turned my brain to molten mush and nothing on this earth could make me happier right now this may be hyperbolic aftershock but fury road is perhaps the best action movie ever made without a doubt its the most metal movie ever made fuck yes mad max
May 17 2015,positive,witness me all shiny and chrome
May 17 2015,positive,finally a big action film that sparingly utilizes cgi 90 of the film is practical effects  a 2 hour long chase that rarely slows down my man crush tom hardy proves again he is one of the best actors of my generation i was alone in my fandom of hardys performance in star trek nemesis as the evil picard clone schninzon but my years of watching hardy has paid off in spades and also george miller at 70 years of age proves himself as being better now than he was over 30 years ago with the first mad max side note how can a guy make such hardcore violent films and then go make beloved family affair like babe and happy feet is astounding to behold
May 17 2015,positive,director george miller gives us unrelenting action with reason and with stakes the result is one hell of a ride
May 17 2015,positive,this movie was excellent balls to the walls action truly a worthy installment to the mad max franchise even better then the previous sequels this gets a perfect 1010 in my book
May 17 2015,positive,best movie of the year 2015 so far
May 17 2015,positive,just incredible  need to see it again
May 17 2015,positive,2015 is turning out to be a great year for the rrated action flick normally this genre is an endangered species in a market full of semikidfriendly superhero movies and other action movies which get toned down to a pg13 rating however this year we have gotten two success stories first the excellent kingsmen the secret service became a surprise hit then mad max fury road one of the most anticipated films of the summer decided to stay true to its gritty rrated roots and delivered a good movie in the process    the movie sees max now played by tom hardy as he escapes imprisonment from a tyrannical leader he then joins a party led by rogue worker played by charlise theron on a journey to therons homeland while being chased by an army of evil soldiers    now prior to watching this i have unfortunately only seen the first mad max movie so i probably cant speak for a lot of the diehard fans however i really enjoyed this movie and from what ive heard a lot of the fans did as well    this film is actionpacked with a lot of car chases and i mean a lot of car chases these chases are very intense and they are made even more intense by the fact that some of the good guys actually die in them this tends to be more tense for me than many movies where i am sure that all of them will survive it also does a good job of displaying the cynical nature of this world that was displayed in the first one    these characters are wellacted tom hardy plays mel gibsons character of max pretty well he convincingly plays a man who is still haunted by the death of his family which i thought made him a more sympathetic character charlise theron also does a great job of playing a convincing badass soldier    in conclusion mad max fury road is an intense wellacted film with plenty of car chases explosions and crashes portrayed mostly with practical effects what a lovely day indeed    jaythemovieguyblogspotcom
May 17 2015,positive,out of ten i would say between a 75 its a very basics fun dumb movie
May 17 2015,positive,the single most epic visual madness ever put on screen ever in the next decade to come we will keep asking ourselves will we ever see a better action movie in our lifetime
May 17 2015,positive,do obviously done by a director who did work in a time when the word work mattered and still cares about the word that its disgusting to consider that society still knows what the word means truly a rarity in the world anymore hats off and a genuine well done to all involved in this more than likely underrated masterpiece from the overwhelming action to the where in the world did they come up with that imagination clichãs and characters to remember for a lifetime thank you
May 17 2015,positive,the masterpiece of actioncar movie is here
May 17 2015,positive,frankly i dont remember much of the original mad max series well having seen just the 1st installment many years ago my memory of the events which transpired is somewhat limited especially when it comes to more specific elements of the world so i might be wrong in saying that this sequel reboot has some of the most ingenious and in depth world building ive seen anyone accomplish even if im wrong about that the post apocalyptic society miller has constructed in this film gives an insight into what humanity might devolve into after the apocalypse in a time when superhero films like avengers or aliens robots beating each other up transformer series are considered action blockbusters director george miller has given us something which we could not even imagine from its exciting trailers  a true blockbuster george miller has returned with the some serious firepower at his disposal firepower in the form of 150 million dollars and the limitless wonders of modern technology miller fires off this ammunition at full force to create the impossibly vast and intimately gritty world of max rockatansky in the grandiose way i think he envisioned it from the start upon seeing the first trailer for this film i said it looked like the mad max film miller always wanted to make but didnt have the tech or the money to accomplish seeing the movie in its glorious two hour entirety affirms that statement the story follows max rockatansky tom hardy an ex highway patrolman haunted by his past who after roaming the deserts is captured  held captive in the citadel the city where the ruthlessly totalitarian leader immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne is ruling over the grotesquely brutal lord maintains tight grip of every valuable resources across the land this brings the entire populace crippling under his control as for max he becomes merely a blood bag for nux nick hoult one of joes war boys who is a fatal devout to the cause of their fascist leader who has promised them the glory of getting into valhalla the promised land during an high octane speed chase he he meets the imperator furiosa charlize theron who is being pursued by the dictatorial wasteland leader joe furiosa reaches for max for help in keeping the five wiveswomen she brought with herinto safety as joes deranged breed of warriors called the war boys that are barely humans are raging across the desert to capture them this pursuit throws the unlikely partners into the walloping dangers of bloody escape suddenly sending them into a game of survival much of the movie is spent with furious speed chases that goes from end to end of joes subjugated land while also taking surprising twists and turns along the way its like it doesnt know how to stop and if it does thats surely only to allow us breathe and catch up with the next electrifying action set piece theres an enigmatic style miller has employed to provide distinctions in his fantasy world and it keeps the momentum in tack if not ever progressing the tone of the movie all those vividly dark colors that magically shifts from something to another imparts a drowning experience only its enjoying and looks festive to the eyes this makes every eyesquashing spectacles take mammoth forms of visual extravaganza turning all those burning combustion metal blasts and endless pursuits from mere technical marvels into a hairraising escapade the action is so brutal and appropriately highoctane i thought to myself more than once i think i am loving this more than terminator 2 but other than that there wasnt time to think it kicked off fast and barely stopped and the lulls were amplified by the insanity preceding them amid these sanitygrabbing action sequences though is an emotional streak that keeps max and furiousas humanity alive hardy is brilliant as the tortured lead character and delivering a believable portrait of his desire to survive the present while mentally enduring his past he is given minimal dialogue but is able to become the heart of this postapocalyptic tale interestingly hardy is not the primary lead in the film that bears his name charlie therons shining portrayal of furiosa is the literal and figurative driver of the film she manages to redefine feminine heroism for film makers she has strength purpose and a sacrificial depth that presses the story beyond a mindless chase scene in a genre that tends to victimize or sexualize the female leads miller portrays a strong female led without any unnecessary feminist underpinnings in masking her natural beauty theron is allowed to develop her strengths and vulnerabilities without making a political statement both hardy and theron are supported by an excellent supporting cast that moves this experience from a mere adrenaline rush to a story of fighting for your right to live seeing that sacrifice is part of freedom and ultimately for the hope for redemption nicholas hoult  rosie huntingtonwhiteley are likeable director george miller delivers a masters class in story telling and stunt driven effects that successfully convey back story cultural nuance and the justification of these desperate acts of disobedience and violence even as the fourth outing for this character we are given a fresh storyline and wealth of new characters for a new generation apparently it is not necessary to see the original films to enjoy this chapter in maxs adventures but just for the sake of it i might go back to watch the first two well received films in this anthology on the whole mad max fury road  is a visual masterpiece its an explosive obscene grotesque beautiful movie which is made to satisfy every movie goer this is a film that needs to be experienced felt and forever cherished this is the best film released all year well it is the best action film so far this of this decade and that is no exaggeration the moment i stepped out of the cinema all i could feel is what a lovely day
May 17 2015,positive,a superb continuation of the mad max franchise look and feel of fury road matches the originals beautifully superior photography stunt work and practical fx make this film a mustsee instant classic
May 17 2015,positive,exactly what i needed
May 17 2015,positive,pretty good had its cheesy moments but most all of those made it great this is one you want to see in the theater and own at home  great film
May 17 2015,negative,the movies was a complete disappointment i am very particular on the movie that i go see on the big screen on the account that theyre so expensive i rely on flixter and the ratings to help make good movie selections for me and my wife however tonight it failed i have never experienced a movie with such high remarks and be such plotless movie lets just say oj simpsons infamous car chase had more of a storyline then this movieif you can call it that however i give the flix was pack with action so that is the on reason i gave it the second star a total disgrace of my childhood memory of my favorite
May 17 2015,positive,does it make me a bad person if this movie absolutely delivered exactly what i wanted as a fan of the original movies fantastic fun
May 17 2015,positive,put your arse into overdrive and get to the nearest theater to see this sequelreboot 30 years in the making  after all this time the waits been worth it as miller pulls out all the stops  the only thing that would have made this movie better would have been a cameo from auntie entity herself the formidable tina turner
May 17 2015,positive,there are some confounding and headscratching moments and not everything always makes sense but as a movie lover and an independent filmmaker i admire everything that happens in this film all the setpieces are beautifully done and exhilarating to watch and charlize theron gives one of her best performances as furiosa george miller is back on his game hold on tight itll blow your mind mad max fury road is a highoctane unstoppable thrill ride
May 17 2015,negative,hands down the worst movie ive seen in years
May 17 2015,positive,tom hardy makes about 3 facial expressions the entire movie yet you feel connected and with his character the whole time never a dull moment
May 17 2015,negative,i have no clue how this movie received such high ratings i loved the first 45 minutes but talk about rewindplayrepeat
May 17 2015,negative,i honestly have no idea how this movie has such a high rating dreary characters  what little dialogue there is does little to improve this movie ridiculous
May 16 2015,positive,masterpiece this is the action movie that puts it all on screen stomps on the gas pedal and doesnt let up for approximately 98 of its 2 hour run time
May 16 2015,positive,this movie is two solid hours of stunning visuals and action despite little exposition and sparse dialogue it effectively creates a livedin world and tells a simple but compelling story
May 16 2015,positive,there should have been more backstory to charlizes character also i wanted to know more about the wives not a movie i enjoyed watching in the theater though too loud and shaky my motion sickness was acting up and i had a tough time looking directly at the screen but the ladies had a happyish ending the bad guy died and there is hope for a brighter future
May 16 2015,positive,absolutely breathtaking i loved every moment of this movie and i was just blown away i cant wait to watch this movie again because it was just that good
May 16 2015,positive,all carnage and no storytelling great world building stunning visual sequences that never moved me
May 16 2015,positive,excuse my tom hardy bias but this movie was frigging amazing
May 16 2015,positive,absolutely mad are you sick of generic action scenes are you sick of overtly positive characters are you sick of pretty actors shoehorning it in are you sick of super hero movies in the summer do you want a movie thats balls to the wall insane do you want a movie that doesnt give you shelter and wont f stop till your on your knees begging for mercy do you want a happy movie or do you want a f mean movie made out of steel and blood thats what mad max is in the words of peter travers this movie kicked my ass itll kick yours
May 16 2015,negative,blah  driving and driving and driving and driving all without much from max
May 16 2015,positive,when you see 97 on the tomatoemeter than youre expecting a bit every previous mad max had at least some sort of plot not this one they are just fleeing from the mean boss in order to save his wives this one takes place on the road for 99 of the time sure its still fun and interesting but you expect a whole lot more after it was hyped so immensely the 3d is decent but as for the movie its only mediocre worth a blu ray yes because it makes a great demo disc but mostly for that reason only
May 16 2015,positive,non stop action  go for the spectacle not for the story  personally i would have liked to have closed captions as i did not hear understand what most characters were saying be it the noise from the vehicles or the person was out of breath or wellhad a mask covering the mouth  for sure edge of your seat film and oh so much chaos and sand explosions and guitar that spews fire  plot hmm was there any   when i walked out i could not help but for some reason remember paulo coelhos the alchemist for some reason i saw a similarity there i guess  all in all cool looking  fast and noisy
May 16 2015,positive,great action movie but max should have been main focus of the film not furiosa
May 16 2015,positive,this movie is completely bonkers and i loved every second this is basically a 2hour actionpacked car chase with very few stops in between the fact that practical effects were used made it look more raw and impressive on screen couple that with the booming sound quality and it made all the chaos so much fun to watch unlike movies like transformers 4 where the action becomes longwinded repetitive and boring this kept me engaged throughout everything about this was amazing
May 16 2015,negative,garbage i dont know what the hell the rest of you are smoking but this movie doesnt come close to the original mad maxroad warrior movies tha actions scenes were well done but confusing no suspense just blow up something and throw somebody of a moving vehicle and watch them get run over and i could drive a semi thru the plot holes in this movie what movie from the past will hollywood ruin next
May 16 2015,positive,this movie is what many people want out of an action movie   very little dialog a simple easy to follow story and action that charges out of the starting gate and never takes its foot off of the accelerator  nonstop action without wasting time trying to make something deep or profound  you can shut your mind off and enjoy the ride      furthermore i really enjoyed the art direction as well as the performances which depict complete and utter insanity  madness and chaos are portrayed perfectly and the vehicles look completely punk rock  this is the embodiment of  heavy metal and punk  i really liked this movie  check it out you wont regret it
May 16 2015,positive,this one goes down as one of my top ten ever  great in so many new ways yet it still has a very familiar vibe with road warrior another top ten favorite of mine
May 16 2015,positive,not having seen the previous movies i was a bit lost as to the backstory and as little of it was explained in the movie i found it hard to make sense of anything which was happening    why charlize was driving a huge semitrailer with five girls and a tankful of milk was never explained nor was her decision to take a crosscountry detour    likewise why max was roaring around the desert in his soupedup car and why the baddies captured him and tied him to their front bumper instead of just knocking him off remains a mystery    the chase and fight scenes were the only entertainment value and top marks to the stuntmen  that part worked    i  found megan gales cameo puzzling and felt it contributed nothing of any consequence to the story  despite comments from the producers that her nude scene was necessary i cannot see why it was necessary for her to strip naked before starting what must have been a pretty boring job of sitting up a disused electricity pylon presumably as a lookout gratuitous nah surely not    all in all it was a confusing plotless mess albeit a well shot and entertaining mess if you just go along for the ride
May 16 2015,negative,omg what a horrible movie how did it get these gr8 ratings no character story or development hardy and theron might have had a paragraph of dialogue in this movie if you just want action and thats really ithere you go
May 16 2015,negative,so i am beyond disappointed this movie had one of the best trailers i have seen in a while and i see a 98 rating on rt and a 93 score for the flixster audience really did we watch different movies did they not notice there was no attempt to build a story nor a decent dialog just a quick reading of how we destroyed the world we knew then were thrown into some world and introduced to some chalky looking guy with a bad hair due and a smokers mask who is apparently ruling the world through its water supply how people took this seriously is beyond me i have seen better story building in pornos but to sum up this movie ranks up there as one of the most disappointing of all time
May 16 2015,positive,not a big fan of senseless action movies luckily this is nothing of the sort if you like action this is a masterpiece for you
May 16 2015,positive,incredible movie unfortunately it gives up halfway  through and literally makes a u turn  although i wish a different avenue could have been explored with the second half  it was still an amazing ride   3 driving puns included
May 16 2015,positive,q who destroyed the world  a men  brilliant movie
May 16 2015,positive,i almost never write a review for movies and never have on this site unless it is an older movie due to the fact that i do not find most modern movies interesting nor funny an acception however can and will be made for this movie it had a lot of features from the older movies fits in isnt to slow but isnt to fast and is crammed packed with action the only thing about this movie i can say i didnt like was the very ending it was shoehorned in and it felt to fast and i know that is a little nitpicky but i really need information to be explained to me aside from that detail it was a great movie and you dont really need any prior knowledge to understand this movie a great watch for newcomers and old fans alike
May 16 2015,positive,excited movie speechless when sawing
May 16 2015,positive,mindblowingly spectacular two hours of pod racing on lsd
May 16 2015,positive,i went into mad max fury road knowing little to nothing about director george millers franchise i attempted to watch his original 1979 film a couple of weeks prior but found myself bored and unable to pay attention and so as much as that statement might be read as sacrilege in the film community i gave up and decided not to move on this didnt lessen my excitement for millers latest installment as im a fan of both tom hardy and the incredible trailers that were crafted for the film my only hope was that the final product lived up to what we caught glimpses of in the trailers and so while i have no real frame of reference and i know i need to go back and at least watch road warrior as ive read the words action classic tossed at it at least a dozen times over the past week i went into fury road with optimism and excitement hoping that what was promised would be delivered and it was the fact miller who is now seventy was even able to pull off half of the stuff we see on screen here is amazing but that he is able to subtly sneak in a compelling story underneath the mayhem is all the more reason to be fascinated by the highly saturated images we watch frenetically move across the screen the big screen it almost goes without saying that the film is gorgeous and the action is superb but as the opening moments play out it is clear one doesnt necessarily have to be familiar with the previous adventures of max rockatansky hardy a brief overview by the titular character is given in the opening moments as he stands on the edge of a sanddrenched cliff getting set for his next adventure as id like to see it into the frame creeps a twoheaded lizard quickly slithering its way closer to max where he stomps on it with his boot heel and picks it up to gather protein we know immediately this is not our world not the one we know we can see even if we havent before that this is a land full of inhabitants who are full of desperation and that bubble of desperation is about to burst for the full twohour runtime of the film fury road barely has time to slow down and catch its breath and even less does it rely on dialogue to move the story along miller firmly believes that actions speak louder than words and he puts that mantra on full display here as mad max fury road is completely bonkers in every way every good entertaining way it can be    read the whole review at 
May 16 2015,positive,this movie is glorious should have been titled max  furiousa in the worlds greatest chase movie amazing visuals thrilling action sequences and great characters what else can you ask for from a summer movie
May 16 2015,positive,i didnt really expect that much from it it was almost nonstop action fire spewing exploding metal shrapnel goodness wrapped around a reluctant hero story with badass women and beyond insane villains
May 16 2015,positive,action lots of action i think one word to describe this movie would be explosive
May 16 2015,negative,this was a very bad dusty nascar race without the commercials and sponsorships
May 16 2015,positive,built a world smashed the shit out of that world won me the hell over yeeeeeeeeeeowza looking forward to another watch so cool
May 16 2015,positive,incredible costumes and props with a perfect setting makes this movie feel like a borderlandsesque wasteland  this installment really compliments the original movies in the series with such constant action that youll forget about that 30 bucket of popcorn 2 minutes into the movie
May 16 2015,positive,it lives up to the hype b
May 16 2015,positive,take one lone drifter max tom hardy one empowered big rig driver furiosa charlize theron add some albinos more freaks than burning man and throw in a whole lot of souped up vehicles and you have the most jawdroppingly original major studio release in many a year and proof that a sequel can be delivered thirty years after its previous installment that outdoes its predecessors riveting unsettling and at times purely insane it is amazing to me that a studio fronted a reported 150 million to finance the biggest cult film ever made a fever dream of surreal imagery and breakneck action that doesnt let up for a second and manages to be both mainstream and fiercely indie at once it may throw some narrative conventions out the window but when the chase scenes are this original any lapses in story can be excused nothing short of an action classic it proves that originality still exists at the multiplex
May 16 2015,positive,a surprisingly great movie plenty of action and great effects
May 16 2015,positive,all i can say is its badass
May 16 2015,positive,holy shit relentless
May 16 2015,positive,a great remake of the original action packed from front to back charlize theron was great
May 16 2015,positive,breathtaking rush of limitless action
May 16 2015,positive,its amount of wicked fun was unthinkable in cinema by me until just the opening shot and its a barrierwrecking revolution for the true and leading hollywood heroine the depth of fury roads delirium bores through the earth and into infinity and cliche forgiven its the same as literally nothing theres ever been at its scale strap in motherfuckers
May 16 2015,positive,wow what a thrill ride of a film i absolutely loved it go watch it now   what a day what a lovely day  nux
May 16 2015,positive,this version of a post apocalyptic world is cast on the edge of sanity  if a person likes things that go boom then they are in for a treat
May 16 2015,negative,i saw a late night showingprobably wouldnt have finished it on netflix  seriously the action was good but there wasnt even the slightest bit of a story or character development until 45minutes in
May 16 2015,positive,an absolutely incredible visual and storytelling experience one of my favorite movies of all time
May 16 2015,positive,this movie was everything i was hoping it would be and so much more it was a nonstop ride of insanity intensity action and mindblowing awesomeness its got everything from insane religious kamikazes to a giant wardrumguitartruck all the way to a giant warrigged semi truck driven by a onearmed badass whos good with a scoped sks it shows the crazy culture of the warboys and the desperation of a destroyed people in a fallen world i mean this movie was one hell of a wild ride it will blow your mind and have you sitting on the edge of your seat and the music goes right along with it too
May 16 2015,negative,awful two hours of the same crap over and over 
May 16 2015,positive,you see ridley scott this is how you return to a franchise crazy over the top with plenty of great moments mad max is what it has always been awesome
May 16 2015,positive,this is the coolest movie
May 16 2015,neutral,they seemed to put all the energy and money into the cars and wardrobe and forgot about the story totally hollow sandy fastcut ultralong car chase movie
May 16 2015,negative,very disappointed like the original much better dont waste your money
May 16 2015,positive,great come back fort the old franchise keeps you on the edge of the chair amazing details on the dystopian environment
May 16 2015,positive,this movie is as close to perfect as any piece of cinema can get it will go down in the annals of history as one of those classics like citizen kane or hitchcock films that get studied in film classes for generations an absolute must see in theaters
May 16 2015,positive,omg this movie is the fucking shit
May 16 2015,positive,this is real cinema loved every second of it
May 16 2015,positive,a visual feast feels epic and a cut above the common offerings of the chaseaction genre there are moments where its like watching circque du soleil in hell  good fun
May 16 2015,negative,absolutely terrible dont believe the hype or the absurd number of positive reviews here mad max should be judged for what it is not for the crappy movies it was trying to pay homage to boring dialogue little to no character development and virtually no backstory made this movie absurd to watch you get the impression that the script writers were fired halfway through so they could save money to blow up more exotic postapocalyptic vehicles
May 16 2015,positive,if you went to the theatre  saw pitch perfect 2 instead of this    fail
May 16 2015,positive,wow doesnt get any better than this
May 16 2015,positive,mad max fury road is a high octane intense nonstop action movie that manages to stand apart because of how incredibly unique and original it is
May 16 2015,positive,great action movie fun character design
May 16 2015,positive,1010 must watch
May 16 2015,positive,best movie ive seen in a long time so epic
May 16 2015,positive,one of the best actions films that i have ever seen i absolutely loved it
May 16 2015,positive,exceptional movie the stunts are amazing theres a feeling you get that you can almost feel as if you were inside the movie direction by george miller is flawless and so is the acting one of the best movies this year
May 16 2015,negative,for starters there was totally no back story at all and to anyone not seeing any of the other mad max movies you pretty much were sol on what brought these people to this place second the action while ok at first for old after a second and was just like one bad case of exploding diarrhea and the guitar playing puppet guyjust stop id have rather watched the alamo vs chupacabra and paid a kid 950 to kick me in the butt cuz thats all i left with was a sore ass and no money
May 16 2015,negative,no idea what all the hype is about its a 2hr version of the trailer and once the wow effect wears off youre left wanting more sadly it never delivers i didnt hate it but i didnt much like it either 4510
May 16 2015,positive,just incredible
May 16 2015,positive,great art and design solid action and stunts simple yet thoughtful storytelling the only thing is that i wish the ending can be even more ridiculous cant wait to watch it second time and get the blue ray to see the behind the scene stuffs
May 16 2015,negative,just awful little plot less development over cgid  so much potential squandered on a 2 hour car chase
May 16 2015,positive,a cracking showdown of a postapocalyptic premise and outstanding visuals wrapped with funfest of mayhem and absurditywhile at the same time showing lack of depth in the plot  few loose ends in the storylinenonetheless its uniqueness will amaze you  will take you to a different world all in on mad max fury road is one hell of a ride
May 16 2015,negative,this movie was grotesque and disturbing
May 16 2015,neutral,mad max fury road is 2 hours of pure nonstop badass action false    disappointing is the one word review for this film directed by rob zombie or george miller channeling his rob zombie we have a film that is both trying too hard and not trying hard enough none of the characters are sympathetic this isnt a heartfelt movie  which is fine i wasnt here for the feelings but when you do not care about the characters youre following and the movie has done nothing to get you to care you will be bored off your arse for stretches of the film that i can deal with the biggest let down is that the film is not crazy enough the action lacks moments you cheer i never once winced at any violent beat there was little tension in the action sequences i chuckled a bit at the funny bits but this was not at all as good as it shouldve been    i think wb knew they made a movie that isnt going to connect with people which is why the advertising turned into support feminism see this movie  this is a terrible feminist movie so please dont even pretend to harold that it should be their new gospel theres a problem when charlize theron doesnt rise above aeon flux and hancock have we all forgotten shes been in action films before i was terribly letdown that her character brought nothing new to her work and max himself extremely passive and unremarkable    fury road does not rise to doomsday level i know people are either buying the hype or dont see action films but being well versed in this genre this was a disappointment maybe the next one will be better but forgettable will be this films legacy
May 16 2015,negative,this was horrible schlock  beyond thunderdome was better than this movie  i guess we know who doesnt run bartertown
May 16 2015,positive,a simply outstanding as well as outstandingly simple postapocalyptic dystopian punk western car chase action film director george miller said that he aspired to hitchcocks ideal of a film that a person in japan could watch enjoy and understand without reading any subtitles and miller has damn well succeeded     if i have one complaint its that not enough time was spent on the slave women their sleeping arrangements their bathing rituals their unblemished bodies what is sex like in the world of mad max specifically group sex i guess well never know le sigh    srsly though bravo george miller take a bow
May 16 2015,positive,yep  nonstop action fun
May 16 2015,positive,best movie since interestelar
May 16 2015,positive,two words guitar guy
May 16 2015,positive,a film that plays out almost like a greek myth its simplicity of story bonkers action and shockingly deep characters make for a fantastic movie thats fun to both watch and think about
May 16 2015,positive,greatest action movie ever made
May 16 2015,positive,mad max is like riding a roller coaster you feel the adrenaline and excitement while youre watching it the visual effects are stunning and the action sequences are out of this world
May 16 2015,positive,this movie is like action ballet
May 16 2015,positive,arguably the best action movie ever made george miller knows exactly what he wants to put on the screen and how to do it a movie of this oddity has never been made before the stunts the pacing the characters the bombastic score are all top notch here this film raises the bar like no other has for many decades
May 16 2015,positive,delicious it was amazing
May 16 2015,positive,im not quite sure this could have lived up to the online hype from the past few weeks but there is a lot to like here the action is insane and the score elevates everything there isnt very much going on story wise but still fun overall
May 16 2015,positive,100 action 100 fun also i love tom hardy
May 16 2015,positive,mad max fury road is the most metal movie you will see this summer this is both its greatest strength but also its greatest drawback at least half of the individual frames of this movie could be used as a cover of a metal album the bad guys the war boys tattoo rock concert lineups on the backs of their victims and run with a lunatic wailing away with a flamespewing guitar in front of a wall of speakers all mounted on a truck screaming across the wasteland  but this isnt just loud cheap bar band metal this is thoughtful this is iron maiden smart metal running right up to the edge of prog there is method to this madness there are character arcs there is emotion there is a central question of whether there is any humanity left in these people but there is still plenty of judas priest as well to punch you right in the face with a spikestudded leather glove  fury road isnt a modernized version of a 1980s movie like weve seen so much of lately no fury road by original mastermind george miller is the exact reverse its a 1980s movie made with modern technology it fits seamlessly into the mad max mythos and the style and tone match the original trilogy perfectly just turned up to 11    full review at aphthakidcom
May 16 2015,positive,this film has haunting visual imagery dramatic depth and bold political vision to accompany its intense welldesigned actions sequences and cgi
May 16 2015,positive,fury road makes road warrior look like a cheap version of beyond the thunderdome  charlize therons furiosa steals the show while nicholas hoult manages to give his best performance till date furiosa is everything you would want a strong female character to be  tom hardy is the leading man that every movie should want in todays age   george millar at 70 still has the magic touch fury road might just be the best action film of this generation the action sequences are masterfully choreographed and the cinematography is stunning all in all this one is a must watch
May 16 2015,negative,a 2 violent car chase skip it
May 16 2015,positive,great action very entertaining just wish tom hardy would have been able to give more in his performance
May 16 2015,positive,it was loud over the top and amazing cant wait to buy it
May 16 2015,positive,a brilliant action film that uses suspense music and stunt work that made this franchise stand out george miller knocked this out of the park great cinematography character development and plot what a lovely day for the mad
May 16 2015,positive,non stop action great themes
May 16 2015,positive,truly an action spectacle well worth watching two hours has never gone so quickly in a movie
May 16 2015,positive,the plot  characterization were thin but just enough to justify some of the most eyepopping action pieces youll ever see on the big screen the theme of redemption was well played with the stories of furiosa and nux being the best  actually the weakest character was max but not enough to undermine these vastly enjoyable film im rating it a one of the best this year so far
May 16 2015,positive,amazing leave it up to a veteran director to show modern hollywood how action movies are supposed to be made george miller the director of the original mad max films returns for another installment the star that pulls this off is not tom hardy or charlize theron it is george miller this film is up to par with the road warrior when watching an installment in the mad max series you got to have a fuck you thats why attitude for example why is there a truck that only has a guy playing an electric flamethrower guitar with taiko drums in the back because fuck you thats why why in the apocalyptic future do we have big diesel trucks with four seater hot rods plastered onto them because fuck you thats why this film is so creative  fury road is the perfect example of escapist action its a world that we the viewer completely lose ourselves in nothing in this film is hacky its a full on creative a scifi action film a note to those millennials who have never seen the previous films or think that this is a liveaction borderlands go fuck yourselves and how could you not have known anything about this franchise  this chapter starts with max being held captive by immortan joe the actor who played toecutter in the 1979 film theron plays furiosa who takes joes wives and leads them into safety on her journey to the green place the promised land of her childhood the whole film is about this chase of immortan joe and his goons v furious max and joes wifes much like the other films the film is about one long battle on the road  much like scorsese miller never lost the youthful energy that went into his early films sure he has directed a sequel to babe and the happy feet films but you can tell that the mad max films is his most beloved piece of work unlike lucas who rushed the prequels of star wars and relied heavily on cgi miller took great time to develop a concept and utilize practical effects which is why this film works this can be considered to be a throwback to the 80s style of action however this is what we needed in this day and age  hardy does a good job as mad max even though i was constantly wondering how badass it would be if it was an aged mel gibson theron is ruthless as furiosa overall everyone did a great job in making this film come alive and making the world of mad max so believable  check this film out for the experience the action is topnotch this is not a reboot nor remake it is another chapter in the series george miller really shows these young directors how to make a movie
May 16 2015,positive, thunderdome  road warrior
May 16 2015,positive,just what the doctor ordered
May 16 2015,positive,bechdel test barbarians barely a dull moment in the whole film loved every minute highly recommended for every feminist and chaotic action fan alike

May 16 2015,positive,what a lovely day fury road unleashes a hellish postapocalyptic masterpiece born through relentless teethclenching action and a stirring narrative insane chaotic imaginative maximum enjoymentno pun intended
May 16 2015,positive,ive seen the old mad max trilogy but its been over 20 years  i remember enough to know their influence in the world of film and videogames  this whole dirty destroyed wasteland of a future where people are either crazy or warriors never did it for me  not a style i ever look forward to  there is so much glorious madness in fury road however that i couldnt help but love it  its hard to imagine one movie being able to do so many crazy things well  tom hardy is one of those guys you need to watch everything he does  we already know how good charlize theron was and she killed it in this role  even rosie huntingtonwhiteley learned how to act since that transformers movie she did and that might be the biggest shocker here  a lot of surprises for me since i was only going off the one early trailer  some of the best explosive action youll ever see in a movie  its hard to believe something could hold up to all the stellar reviews and twitter love but it certainly does
May 16 2015,positive,welcome to the 2015 summer blockbuster season where science fiction and superhero films dominate the urban sea big screens light up with flashy cgi and flashier heroes antiheroes and villains all supported by a maddening crowd of quirky sidekick characters and excitable extras enter the postapocalyptic realm of mad max a quintessential 1980s franchise updated to 2015 standards the idea of mad max as a rogue antihero wandering the desert wastes germinates in the mind of director george miller miller and the rest of the developed world saw the energy crisis of the late 1970s and early 1980s as a potential point for global meltdown war nukes etc and from this crisis mad max emerges in mad max fury road miller guides a renaissance using skilled cinematography ie camera positions etc to tell his furious road warrior movie in an recent interview miller explained he desired to make mad max fury road as a film that would not need subtitles because visuals tell the story which it does very well the characters are purposely underdeveloped and that understandably proves frustrating to viewers and hurts the film miller probably relied to heavily of past generations memories of the 1980s storyline which is a mistake if a true renaissance of mad max is to occur the actors are very well chosen and realize millers production splendidly charlize theron basically owns the show as furiosa a female road warrior on a mission of mercy and redemption a sequel focusing on furiosa is reportedly in the works there is an interesting feminist vibe throughout the film as viewers will note max played stoically well by tom hardy and a unrecognizable nicholas hoult seem to just be tagging along for the ride the hoult character nux contains an interesting storyline of a fanatic who cannot wait to die for cause until he finds a cause to live for sacrifice is a key theme throughout mad max and blood engines sand gas grease and guns are the audiences vehicles in one wild ride
May 16 2015,positive,nonstop thriller teeming with a bunch of stunning action scenes that leave you breathless not only does mad max fury road remind us of how an awesome action movie is supposed to be it also takes the current aspect of the genre to a whole new level
May 16 2015,positive,mad max fury road this fourth installment of the mad max franchise 30 years after thunderdome is a surreal overthetop adrenalinefueled joy ride of action and violence  an assault on the senses unlike any film in recent history with a surprisingly solid story that will keep you mesmerized throughout tom hardy does an excellent job as the title character but its charlize theron that steals the show as one bad ass bitch a
May 16 2015,positive,this movie was the best movie if you are into kill kill kill  hart pounding funcritic julian rohweder
May 16 2015,negative,i cant remember the last time i was so disappointed in a movie  im a huge fan of the originals and thought i was in for a real treat  instead i got a 15 hour car chase  no plot no character development and practically no dialogue  if you feel you absolutely must see this wait for netflix

May 16 2015,negative,i am in the theater now and utterly dont get it despite my love of fantasy action and all things bizarreits painful i was convinced with the originalsand now validated with this one that this is one of those moviestrilogies that people just say they like to look coolunintelligible nonsense that said only redeeming quality its brilliantly shot and designed yawn
May 16 2015,positive,tough movie to rate extremely bizarre and quirky but awesome action  acting  directing
May 16 2015,negative,i would say this movie has plot holes but you would need a plot for that

May 16 2015,positive,everything that was great about the road warrior made new this is much more than a car chase movie
May 16 2015,positive,damn good film to watch in theatres what a spectacle but im not sure it will hold up for home viewing without a state of the art system still definitely worth the watch
May 16 2015,negative,huge disappointment i dont understand the hype theres plenty of action but the plot line is horribly poor i was so bored throughout the whole film im all for cation but come on at least have a decent plot line then again what can i expect the others werent any good either
May 16 2015,positive,over the top loud but very detailed action sequences script thin on my point of view but superb acting and very good rhythm crazy but so enjoyable
May 16 2015,positive,exhausting in the best way possible
May 16 2015,positive,very intense one of the best persecution scenes on the screen ive seen  great soundtrack cinematography and really well acted  55
May 16 2015,positive,excellent movie  gotta watch it in the theater
May 16 2015,negative,feminist drivel wrapped in a shoot em up action film not worthy of the mad max title
May 16 2015,positive,another triumph of full throttle style and nonstop action over substance
May 16 2015,positive,sit back or at times squirm in your seat and enjoy the visual and audio sensory overload trip along fury road
May 16 2015,negative,visually stunning with thin acting barely any script and no storyline  dont believe the hype   its crap
May 16 2015,positive,mad maxs masterpiece action movie to saw in many year ago   you must to see its a new way of action films 
May 16 2015,positive,overthetop yet shows restraint where necessary a fun and brilliantly imagined film that most definitely earns its name gorgeous albeit with a tired color palette and to the point this is a tremendous action film with some of the best stunt work ever committed to screen that i saw but still have trouble believing
May 16 2015,negative,expected an epic story received a computer game intro sequence that went for two hours
May 16 2015,negative,gore for no reason gruntingkilling  dustthat is all 2 hours of my life that ill never get back 
May 16 2015,positive,one of the best action movies ive ever seen i highly recommend it and keep in mind its extremely violent fortunately i really felt the violence was well done given the story line and incredible
May 16 2015,positive,a two hour orgasim
May 16 2015,neutral,well it was acceptable but i think it was poorly directed spent most of the movie asking myself is it almost over poor directing badly written script overall it was ok for action junkies but dont expect much else
May 16 2015,positive,in a day and age when the major film studios test and focus group every little thing about a movie to make it appeal to the widest audience possible mad max fury road is some kind of miracle    george millers wacky adrenalinefueled chase movie is quite possibly the most bizarre and idiosyncratic film to come out of mainstream hollywood in ages and we should all be incredibly thankful for it what ended up on screen is gloriously shot scored perfectly and  in what is perhaps the greatest novelty of all features action that is actually coherent  a directorial skill that was beginning to seem extinct in an era that favors rapid cutting and little regard for cinematic geography     im not quite convinced that everyone is going to walk out of this flick completely blown away in fact some way walk out crosseyed and confused by what they just watched but theres more originality on display in any fiveminute segment of this puppy than most movies have in their entire running time and for that i say kudos to george miller with a big salute to warner bros for actually letting him do it i dont know what theyre smoking over there in burbank but i hope they never run out
May 16 2015,positive,this movie is action from start to finish with a small break in the middle the plot isnt great but its enough to keep the movie together what really makes this movie so good are the insanely long action sequences they are so well done in every way possible its unbelieveable definitely one of the best action movies of the past few years
May 16 2015,positive,high octane intense action fast moving along with weird characters kept me at the edge of the seat tom hardy eye candy charliez theron was perfectly cast as furiosa im glad my mind was changed and saw this awesome movie
May 16 2015,positive,mad max fury road was one of the most insane absurd and unnecessarily over the top movies ive ever seen  and i loved every minute of it  take every great moment from the original three put the pedal to the metal crank that sucker up to 11 and fury road is what will come out the other side  there where explosions flipping cars insane car to car fight scenes more explosions a guy strapped to car of amplifiers playing a guitar that belched fire  and most of this was done with practical effects  it really was a call back to a better more pure era of action movies  mad max fury road is a 2 hour unrelenting unapologetic car chase that grabs you buy the balls and doesnt let go and when all is said and done youll be saying thank you sir  may i have another bottom line is go see this movie
May 16 2015,positive,mad max fury road is a relentless 2hour thrill ride providing just enough character development to bolster its gorgeouslycrafted utterly insane action set pieces
May 16 2015,positive,mad max fury road is one of the best action movies ever made it is a marvel to witness practical effects being used throughout this movie the action is spectacular the movie is essentially one long car chase and while that may seem tedious to some the movie upstheante with each action set piece tom hardy steps into mel gibsons shoes as max and he couldnt be more perfectly cast charlize theron almost steals the show as furiosa both give solid performances along with the rest of the cast miller gives everyone the chance to shine through their performances mostly through visuals and little dialogue which is refreshing to see the production design is masterfully done with great designs of the vehicles the camera work is amazing and wellshot fury road is an action film that doesnt rely on shakycam and fast cutting so much that you cant see whats happening onscreen the score is great and thrilling and provides an emotional gutpunch to certain scenes this is just a great film to look at its about time we get a postapocalyptic film that doesnt look so bleak gray and colorless the real joy is seeing real effects shot on camera with real stunts this is the first film in a long time where i sat there wondering to myself how the hell did they do that that is a rarity given this day in age of cgi overkill with certain films all in all mad max fury road is fantastic and i cant wait to see it again amazing that 70yearold george miller has raised the bar for action movies hollywood take note this is how you do an action movie it is a masterpiece in my opinion and ranks alongside mad max and the road warrior it is an insane film but for a mad max movie that is what i paid to see if youre a fan of the previous films you will love this movie see it on the big screen it is an experience like no other what a lovely day
May 16 2015,negative,terrible movie waste of time and money not sure i would trust the rotten tomatoes ratings after this
May 16 2015,positive,such a great movie it doesnt stop
May 16 2015,negative,really have no idea where all the positive reviews come from talk about dull this is nothing but a 2 hour car chase across the desert plenty of action but nothing else no plot no dialogue and no character development at first you wonder why is max doing all this by the end you just dont care happy enough that it ended worst film of 2015 for me
May 16 2015,positive,blood and thunder thats probably the most apt description i could think of when describing this or rather a movie injected with steroids and rabies easily the best action flick ive seen in some time because well everything works and its all fucking fantastic especially when you have 70something yearold ladies sniping brutes with a rifle while riding shotgun on a desertcycle  theres a ruthless efficiency to the movie especially the dialogue its sparse but necessary you are told exactly what you need to know and not much more the action sequences amazing some of the most inventive roadchase blowem up shootem up scenes ive ever seen one of the takes apparently took 175 days to get right and the team that did all the design work from the sets the costumes the tattoos and on and on really earned their salary  it has a relatively soft r rating in that there was no nudity a few short scenes of graphic violence but mostly lots of ragdolls being exploded about though max has first billing charlize theron is probably the most badass of the bunch along with a gaggle of ladies who tear shit up what else is there to say if you like action movies with a side of action and a dessert of action watch this otherwise you could watch the view or something
May 16 2015,positive,its very entertaining and an excellent transition for a new generation of fans
May 16 2015,positive,mad max fury road is above and beyond any action thriller ive ever seen the stunts and effects are off the charts for incredible and amazing with added help from the strange alien landscape the film sucks you into the madness and fire instantly the story and motivations behind the characters are well thought out and beautifully executed taking a more feminine aspect while still retaining plenty of male oriented plot points and fixtures tom hardy as always is enchanting as the broken troubled and badass max rockatansky playing on every moment he appears on screen with acute mannerisms and phrases to convey all the emotion and judgment he needs charlize theron is equally brilliant as imperator furiosa with a troubled past and drive to accomplish anything thrown her way the madness and mayhem of everyone sweeps you up for an intense thrill ride of epic caliber
May 16 2015,positive,excellent movie  it was a lot more about charlize therons character but none the less still a great film  i would say its more of a road warrior film than a mad max  great job
May 16 2015,positive,see it this should become the new standard for action movies it is that good
May 16 2015,positive,amazing movie great cgiyou could barely tell that it was cgi the best movie ive seen this year  grade a
May 16 2015,positive,why do parents bring children to violent movies
May 16 2015,negative,hhmmnot sure what all the hype was about not much of a story
May 16 2015,neutral,i dont get the hype is this a movie or just one admittedly technically brilliant action sequence
May 16 2015,positive,mad max is an excellent movie but i have to agree with others thet point out max was more of a background character in his own movie it seems to be a growing trend in hollywood to place female characters as costars in male stories maybe women require men stories writers and director to empower them but it hasnt seemed to be working over the last twenty or so years women seem far more interested in pitch perfect and 50 shades of gray  both of which soundly beat fury road at the box office
May 16 2015,neutral,popcorn movie moments of gorgeous cinematography and delightful stunts characters undeveloped big decisions and big moments poorly directed and edited surprisingly bad sound  adr at times i like tom hardy but mel gibson did this character better    interesting to see if this franchise can continue to develop like 007  especially if we quit fossil fuels and get automated cars
May 16 2015,positive,incredible what a sequel should be
May 16 2015,positive,oh shit    mad max fury road definitely lives up to the hype this is a furious heartpounding relentless masterpiece that is the best mad max movie yet and possibly the best action movie this century    tom hardy is great max max mixed with a little bane this is really furiosas movie though and charlize theron absolutely kills it i also really liked nux a nearly unrecognizable nicholas hoult    the worldbuilding is intense showing the horrors of a postapocalyptic world especially how horrifying it is for women the female characters are heroic most of the male characters are monsters and the rest are antiheroes reluctant looking out for themselves but occasionally reaching deep for heroic moments    the visuals are stunning but even more amazing is how little cgi there is and how many practical effects and amazing stunts were required to pull off the action
May 16 2015,positive,mad max more like mad maxine tom hardy is hardly mad   he showed more emotion and personality as bane makes me miss crazy old mel gibson  this film belongs to charlize theron
May 16 2015,positive,oh man that was awesome
May 16 2015,positive,someone deserves an award for character design on this movie what a beautiful array of crazy steam punky custumes great action sequences and plot
May 16 2015,positive,everything i wanted from an adult action film nothing i didnt
May 16 2015,positive,a great nonstop action film    all casts did a very good job specially charlize theron   soundtracks are okay some scene i feel its too much of soundtrack like  too loud  george miller brings back the calssic and turns into modern action  overall its pretty good make sure watch the first three before check fury road otherwise u would not 100 understand
May 16 2015,positive,mad max fury road is not only one of the best action films every made it holds up among any genre of film fury road is so insanely well made the practical effects are wonderful and the soundtrack is utilized stunningly thurman and hardy gave amazing performances everyone gave amazing performances the only major gripe i have with this movie is some of the cg effects towards the end look rushed and not nearly as good as the rest of the effects in the film overall this film is absolutely stunning i sat there with a smile like that of a 7 year old on christmas morning it is beautifully awesome
May 16 2015,positive,mad max fury road is exhilarating relentless and completely ridiculous in all of the right ways george miller has crafted his one of the greatest action films in cinema history
May 16 2015,positive,awesome beginning to end best movie ive seen in a long time
May 16 2015,positive,best action movie ive seen in a while great special effects not too many cliche linesi enjoyed it from the first minute to the end
May 16 2015,positive,george miller has crafted the greatest action film of all time fury road is an exhilarating adrenalinerushing piece of cinema that never loses focus of its characters amidst the stunning chaos that unfolds before our eyes the performances are solid the cinematography is exquisite the action is breathtaking and i cant wait to see what miller comes up with in future installments
May 16 2015,positive,wow what a crazy thrillride this post apocalyptic world is so well realized that you can smell the grease of the steampunk engines mad max is back and he is not taking any prisoners 1010 
May 16 2015,positive,crazy people drive crazy cars to crazy music there are a lot of pregnant women and explosions its essentially one long somethingpunk adrenalinpumping action sequence    max is in this movie but the emphasis is definitely on the mad    you should watch it
May 16 2015,positive,kicked into high gear right from the start and never let off the gas pedal best film ive seen in a while charlize theron absolutely stole the show
May 16 2015,positive,just a quiet peaceful movie not if you want to get your adrenaline going a must see
May 16 2015,positive,i honestly dont understand all the love for this movie the action scenes were great but the rest was boring and who else was curious about charlize therons missing arm
May 16 2015,negative,a two hour high production value hard rock death metal music video very little dialogue practically zero character development and you genuinely dont care who lives or dies this is not mad maxthis is a wasteland video game     finally i pitied the small children brought into this film by parents without enough sense to remove them after the opening scene in no way an appropriate for people under 16
May 16 2015,positive,probably the most beautifully shot action movie of all time mad max is not just an incredibly well directed edited and shot action movie it is boistered by a surprisingly poetic script  fantastic performances and emotional weight a true masterpiece
May 16 2015,negative,really 98 is waterworld but without water  the characters are a copy of borderland this movie sucks
May 16 2015,positive,its amazing  beautiful movie with great characters story action visuals and style  highly recommended
May 16 2015,positive,take a deep breath before your mind gets completely blowed away by this maniac bizarre and beautiful piece of cinema
May 16 2015,positive,the action and visual effects actually live up to the hype  the action scenes are so well crafted that they should be considered art  the only thing that keep this movie from being a masterpiece is the lame villains
May 16 2015,positive,mad max fury road is one of the best action films of the year i loved the storyline and the cinematography was beautiful
May 16 2015,positive,weirdly beautiful action most fun ive had in a theater for quite some time
May 16 2015,neutral,richs popcorn review on  mad max  this movie is fast paced lots of action violence in your runofthemill survival chase movie pretty good for entertainment if this type of movie is your cup of tea  i must give this movie a 5 
May 16 2015,positive,wonderful  story line intertwined  all of previous movies special effects  and backgrounds  were great
May 16 2015,negative,ive walked out of only one other movie in the hundreds ive seen in the theater
May 16 2015,positive,amazing action sequences
May 16 2015,positive,the best summer movie you will see this year and probably one of the top 5 movies of the year
May 16 2015,positive,it was visually stunning and i just loved the action in the film as well as the tremendously amazing stunts  if the stunt work in mad max  fury road as well as the ones in furious 7 doesnt convince the academy that there should be an oscar category honoring stunt coordination i dont know what will    as for the acting i thought tom hardy did a wonderful job as mad max  i also enjoyed charlize therons performance as furiosa  i also liked the story as well as the direction and cinematography    of all of the mad max films fury road ranked as perhaps my second favorite film behind the road warrior    its a worthy film for everyone to see    i give it a grade of an a    enjoy
May 16 2015,positive,ok before seeing this movie repeat after me  this is a george miller film   now let that sink in  this isnt michael bay or jj abrams  its not going to be stylized and perfect  its going to be weird  and weird it is  from start to finish you almost constantly ask yourself  what the hell am i watching  but right before you think you made a bad decision you see something or hear something awesome and you are roped right back in some of the most spectacular action sequences with real explosions and real cars  so un believe able and crazy you cant help but enjoy it my hats off to the sound direction  the use of music and sound is spectacular  and the flame throwing guitar player for some reason just works and adds to the sequences  well worth seeing and crazy good fun  just remember that this isnt a pretty movie by no means  it will however take your breath away with some of the most creative and awesome action sequences youll see this side of avengers
May 16 2015,negative,officially the worst movie ive seen in my entire life its about half as good as the supergirl trailer but with less plot enjoy the 50 words of dialog in this dud
May 16 2015,positive,backstory 1979 mad max the austlalian new wave movie spawned a genre of dystopian future motor mayhem movies max a police officer went on a rampage to avenge his wife and sons death by a motorcycle gang and was deemed mad at the end then came the road warrior followed by beyond thunderdome where the fight for gas and survival carry on  this fury road is closer to the road warrior which was my favorite of the original trilogy youll either love it or hate it simple plot and setting with awesome stunts and stunning visual effects tom hardy does a decent job but mel gibson will always be my mad max
May 16 2015,positive,hardy did a great job channeling mel this movie was fantastic cant wait to see it again
May 16 2015,positive,hell of a ride the guy with guitar vehicle was so fucking cool
May 16 2015,positive,i dunno  i guess i was expecting a better plot given all of the hype  in the end its exactly what you expect it is  its old school with just a smidgen of cgi
May 16 2015,positive,this movie is visually very stimulating and tom hardy is perfect for the role as max
May 16 2015,positive,the movie had a good bases story line and powerful actors
May 16 2015,positive,ive only seen one of the original movies this one started off full of action and stayed that way you definitely need some background of the storyline to fully grasp the characters in the movie i wasnt disappointed and this lived up to the stellar reviews would have really enjoyed it more in 3d
May 16 2015,positive,the movie started off slow and i thought it will go nowhere but it does get better its a very interesting movie
May 16 2015,negative,incredibly boring movie have not walked out of a movie in over 15 years could not take another minute of this horrible movie all over the place no emotional connection to characters absolutely horrible
May 16 2015,positive,personally i had gone in not expecting much i just didnt think tom hardy can fill young mel gibsons shoes but he did a good job    this movie feels like it was made in the 80s not much dialog just pure unadulterated mayhem for the fans of mad max and fans of action movies this is a must see     the movie is a proper sequel to mad max ii the road warrior george miller is a genious
May 16 2015,positive,that was one crazy movie
May 16 2015,positive,this movie is completely effing crazy this is the best way i can describe it there is no reason for anything that happens in the movie its just a nucking futs adventure and in a movie culture that does all it can to cram meaning down your throat it was really refreshing to watch something that just is what it is youre dropped into a world where youre given no explanation for why things are the way they are they just are and its awesome
May 16 2015,negative,no storyline it was just two car chases
May 16 2015,positive,amazing wow i havent enjoyed a movie that much in a long time
May 16 2015,positive,30 years in the making a preproduction riddled with continual starts and stops cast changes and release dates and a film prior to it that left most die hard fans on this genre defining series deflated angered and wondering why the hell tina turner was in a george miller film never mind the saxophonist doesnt sound like what we are going to receive is a winner even i was extremely skeptical and that was with the mind blowing teaser trailers luckily i can report that after sitting in the very centre of an imax screen earth shattering surround sound and 3d glasses to boot by the end of the 2 hour run time my heart was officially close to cardiac arrest not keen on the idea of 3d dont worry miller actually used a 3d rig to film this so here we dont have horrid post production 3d we have true depth and feel but a little more on that later fury road follows our much loved protagonist max sometime after the events of beyond the thunderdome his mind is shattered he is a introverted quiet and selfish man constantly on the run constantly fighting every element possible in a baron world littered with thugs killers rapists and demonesque leaders this is a world where packs rule the roost causing a class system that forces the masses upon starvation and poverty while the powerful use and abuse for their own means even if its just to boost their ego after being caught max by a huge gang of road warriors he finds himself imprisoned in a city run by the most disgraceful of leaders max is used to feed blood into the character of nux a young fanatical that wishes to impress his leader so much that he will be shown the way to valhalla meanwhile furiosa a queen bee warrior figure is tasked with taking a large cargo and filling it up with precious gasoline only she has another agenda one to thwart the evil leader and one that sets in motion a 2 hour long chase through the baron apocalyptic landscape in hope of finding her home town that is essentially what this film is one very long and very impressive car chase shifting in gear at every turn think mad max 2s climactic car sequence but injected with a cocktail of every drug known to man it sounds stale but what we have here is not only one of the best entries in the cannon but one of the best action movies in forever its laced with so much iconography and meaty plot that you cannot help be suckered in the idea that because max is psychotic his blood can ultimately boost a dying youths thirst to fight the demi god that runs his city and the broken political system the strong feminist moments littered throughout really bringing women to the forefront and burying the hatchet in order to escape and become something more something they deserve to be of course the typical frank miller moments make it in there but the mans clearly lost his mind cartels of vehicles contain a roster of characters from a elasticated guitarist that shoots fire from his guitar head while riffing out a beat for the tribe to drive to the drummers who lay down the death march the rival factions coming together as one to chase down max and furiosa the practical and downright outstanding effects work its classic miller but fresh new against the grain gone is a lot of his hoaky humour while it still has moments of tongue in cheek this is a far polished effort the cast are astounding theron stealing the show as furiosa he empowerment and strength is brilliant to see especially when you would expect to watch max be the one pulling all the punches in fact hardy takes a back seat almost he down plays max in such a subtle way allowing the agenda of therons character to really grip you not that hardy is bad quite the opposite he kicks ass and pays homage to mel while adding a touch of his own nicholas hoult is extremely impressive as nux a role so bipolar and frenetic its hard not to love his screen time in fact everyone is on point here id be here all day if i were to explain in depth all the characters but the supporting roster of freaks geeks and mutants are extremely bizarre and wonderful what really makes this movie shine however is the chase itself this is as close to practical bombastic genius as you are going to get anytime soon cargos of monster truckers laden with characters springing back and forth from cars using unique weapons to blow shit up pole vaulting between vehicles and just making a mess is dealt with in such a stylistic and real life way that every blow every explosion every rip and tear is felt its real your in there and with the 3d i myself was ducking grenades in my seat my heart was pounding i was having a panic attack while in complete awe at what i was seeing the score also rams everything home its huge its emotional and its bombastic you never have time to breathe and if you are the looming threat is enough to keep you on the edge of your seat all the effort goes to show as even people who are unfamiliar with the originals are hording out to get copies miller has outdone himself here and this really is a film that should be celebrated for scope and visual finesse the film is however not without some flaws as i mentioned earlier max takes a back seat and although i know maxs history i still couldnt help but feel i was missing something a bit more from the writing of his character his arc isnt really there hes just max yeah he struggles with mental health but it never goes anywhere the film also has so many faces in it by the final chapter that when it kicks off for the final time a lot of characters are being massacred and you just dont know much about them if anything at all there is also a back tracking element to the whole thing that feels a bit forced or unsure at the 3 quarter mark the film doubles back on itself with no real sense of time or true motivation it just kind of happens these things do taint the movie somewhat but in all honesty i was too busy trying to make sure i didnt need medical attention after the film it threw and blew me all over the room it battered me over the head it made me laugh made me jump made me gasp in awe its not oscar winner but for what it is i dare you to find something more solid and expertly crafted my understanding is that hardy has signed on for more and if this is the case hopefully miller allows him space to breathe and adapt but if its a roller coaster your looking for this is the daddy
May 16 2015,positive,who knew a two hour car chase could be so good superb film
May 16 2015,positive,visually stunning and incredible actionstunt work the story was pretty straight forward
May 16 2015,positive,mad max is back its the best bad ass movie ive in a long time charlize theron is the bad ass fun ugly beautiful violent but the good one worth every penny cant wait for the next one
May 16 2015,positive,that was delightful
May 16 2015,positive,a must see on the big screen
May 16 2015,positive,best action movie ever made enough said
May 16 2015,positive,though its choice of narrative is odd its mad maxs distinctiveness and ability to keep you believing and appreciating the story that is astounding while credit must be given to miller for making it so this film stands on its own feet not buckling under its own weight the efforts of all performers stunt people and designers all help sell this world which is something new and different to anything else this summer the film kick starts with thrilling and inventive actions sequences that only help the films pace along with emotional and real performances from theron and hardy who also blend seamlessly into this world of automobiles brought to life also by its great 3d that absorbs you into maxs visions the mad cap action and the deep environments
May 16 2015,positive,expectations  surpassed
May 16 2015,positive,the opening sequence best ive seen in a long time action all the way through wonderful reboot
May 16 2015,positive,wickedly awesome fun movie you can tell that george miller couldnt wait to make this film after its 30 years hiatus visually compelling and crafted to perfection
May 16 2015,negative,dont believe the hype visually stunning but the story is awful acting so so except charllze dialogue is corny ridiculous references to other australian movies and the movie title the soundtrack is terrible not to mention the stupid guitar playing gimp that never stops playingand right when you think it cant get any worse 3d effects appear in their worst mad max 2 was believablecredible plot and weird enough to be wonderful fury road has mistaken that to mean we will believe in a post apocalyptic world extravagance and waste will be common place disappointed is an understatement
May 16 2015,positive,off the charts awesome
May 16 2015,positive,badass to the highest degree every actor is insane the cinematography is perfected and the editing is noticeably well done even the little details of this movie make it more interesting and more fun to watch theres not much of a plot but you dont need a plot with this good of an action movie
May 16 2015,positive,an epic adrenaline pumping thrill ride that keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end
May 16 2015,positive,absolutely brilliant an all levels this is probably the best action movie ive ever seen with a beautifully constructed opening scene it sucks you in from the very beginning and you just want to keep watching its got strong believable characters portrayed by great acting its full of action but not at the expense of storytelling quality and the story is simple yet compelling mad max fury road is a mustsee without doubt and not just once but time and time again
May 16 2015,positive,take all of what you liked about mad max and make a movie out of them  george millers post apocalyptic vision is as sharp as ever  im sure computerized special effects were used but this felt as real as the originals  buckle up and hold on for a heart pounding ride down fury road
May 16 2015,positive,extremely over the top action definitely worth watching 
May 16 2015,positive,greatest movie ive ever seen in theaters probably my new favorite movie of all time
May 16 2015,negative,im a fan of the mad max films up to now previous mad max films had a strong story line weaved through the explosions etc in fury road max is neutered and plays second fiddle to fury found the film relied too much on gratuitous violence and had minimal mad max machismo very dissatisfied
May 16 2015,positive,the best description for this movie that i can come up with is that its like a combination of looney tunes road runner  wily coyote fast  furious and mario kart on steroids while the story and plot are very simplistic the visual elements of mad max are all amazing to witness witness me from the practical action sequences to the undeniably incredible production values and stellar acting mad max fury road is definitely an overthetop masterpiece
May 16 2015,positive,wow best action movie in a long time
May 16 2015,positive,mad max fury road was a fantastic postapocalyptic fantasy experience the most memorable image in the film was the villain with the flaming guitar which i believe sets up the tone for this masterpiece of heavy metal  its really a rock opera more than anything it has 2 hours of storyline with as much depth as a music video but thats the point its not meant to be viewed intellectually but should be experienced in a meditative state with its taiko drums pounding your eardrums and flames and dust peppering your eyeballs drop your higher forms of reasoning and follow your gut instinct to watch this movie
May 16 2015,positive,never saw any of the originals not into supedup motor vehicles and dystopian desert  but the buzz from this made me have to see between ff7 ultron and now mad max summer 2015 has upped its game this movie has so much action i was tired from watching
May 16 2015,positive,the best thing about this movie is that the casting for every character was spot on the stunt work is absolutely stunning
May 16 2015,positive,awesome action scenes and lots of them
May 16 2015,positive,one giant wild ride the action stays with you and its great to see a step back from all the cgi but as good as it is it will leave you wondering how great it could have been with more character depth
May 16 2015,positive,this is the movie furious 7 and age of ultron wishes it was   
May 16 2015,positive,i walked out of this movie wanting a tattoo of charlize therons  furiosa on my back 
May 16 2015,negative,as a fan this is shit
May 16 2015,positive,the action scenes and the way it was shot was great great reboot movie
May 16 2015,positive,growing up ive always considered lord humungus to be one of the best overthetop villains in motion picture history  probably because he is  i loved the road warrior movie  so raw  so action packed  it never gave you a chance to ask questions why  it just dropkicked you into a barren postapocalyptic future where weaponized spikey vehicles with blowers sticking out the hoods that probably also had weapons inside those were constantly trying to drive up yer tail pipe  well guess what  mad max fury road was better at being the road warrior than the road warrior was  5 stars  great action flick   george miller this one looks like your masterpiece  you still got it big guy
May 16 2015,positive,simply amazing go see it so we dont have to wait another 30 years to see george millers genius again
May 16 2015,positive,whoaaa fangirling yes fangirling with what is the best action movie ever filmed the amount of fucking woman power in this movie is so unbelivable ive never seen such an empowering and constant presence the camera shots the music the performances charlize theron stealed the show okay the adrenaline and excitement was so high that my eyes watered such crazy and rad storytelling all the praise
May 16 2015,positive,mad max was a movie that was exhilarating  from beginning all the way through the end  i was on the edge of my seat and i loved every bit of it the soundtrack was freaking awesome if you like lighthearted movies this movie is not for you lol
May 16 2015,positive,intense bombastic reboot of millers iconic australian post apocalyptic series there are no development of characters or in depth story line feels like one long exhaustive action scene on steroids the stunts are crazy
May 16 2015,positive,as close to visual music as movies get a 2hour stream of the densest style assault you can imagine and then some
May 16 2015,positive,if you like nonstop action scenes then youll love this movie if you are interested in more than that youll be disappointed in this film we learn absolutely nothing new about max himself and very little about furiosa or the other women in the movie george miller seems to think that pounding viewers with pulsating music and one explosion after another is the way to go unfortunately you become numb to the excessive body count and different ways to smash up vehicles go back and watch the original mad max there was some characterization and subtleties to the movie thats long gone now unfortunately
May 16 2015,positive,oh what a lovely day    the sarcastic tagline to george millers 30 year follow up to his beloved mad max series mad max fury road sarcastic because there is little to nothing that happens in the film that could really seen as lovely although i guess if i was living in a postapocalyptic wasteland surrounded by cannibals robbers and murderers then a healthy dose of ass kicking on them may actually be lovely    what makes fury road a most welcome breath of fresh air is not only the fact that it lives up to the expectations for mad max fans of old with nonstop action but because it is a sequel waitwhy would a sequel be a breath of fresh air after all we are living in the era of film sequels from the comic book giants of marvel and dc one man show liam neeson be honest every movie he makes is just a continuation of taken to even comedies like 21 jump street and the hangover ugh what makes fury road different from other sequels and what should make it the benchmark for blockbuster sequels in the future is the time in between the previous film    the last mad max film was the dreadful tina turner is the villain one 30 years ago aka mad max beyond thunderdome whats so good about the time in between is that it gave george miller time to actually come up with a good script for the film not that he had been writing the film for 30 years or anything but there is something to be said for stepping away from that universe and character and do other things until that genuine inspiration hits you again like it clearly did for miller that avoids the rush to just churn out another asap so you can keep gettin them checks as my boy jalen rose would say not that i have anything against making money but knowing that i took the time to make a sequel that is at least on par with my successful original would be the most satisfying    in fury road we find our hero max rockatansky tom hardy an empty shell of a human being his family murdered oh a spoiler is it see the original and the guilt of the lives he couldnt save haunting him to the point of madness you smiled be honest that all he wants to do is escape the craziness that has consumed the world around him hardy is hollywoods number one badass at the moment but at the same time there is so much more to him anyone who has read me before knows im big on actors who can utilize facial expressions to convey thoughts and feelings and hardy may be better than anyone at the moment see the drop the interesting thing about max is that he is almost a supporting character in his own movie the movie is more about charlize therons imperator furiosa and her journey to return to her homeland with this group of beautiful women whose job it is to provide children to the villainous immortan joe max just so happens to be caught up in all this as a man whose just in the wrong place at the wrong time    as max inevitably joins forces with furiosa to flee the citadel and immortan joes armies the film goes on to become one almost endless car chase its in these scenes where we see the greatness of the film miller said in a recent interview that he always enjoyed films that made me feel like i just got off of a ride when i left them and that is exactly what it feels like here it isnt just the vehicles chasing jumping and crashing but just the details that are included immortan joe for example has a vehicle apparently made up of two 1950s style coup devilles and when his war party goes on a chase he has one vehicle that is made up of loudspeakers just so he could have one of his henchmen blast rock music as they chase i guess if i ruled the world i would do whatever the hell i wanted too we also see cars covered in spikes spears with explosives on the ends and even people pole vaulting from vehicle to vehicleenjoyably ridiculous    if anything else can be said about mad max fury road is that its really a movie thats perfectly suited to the 2015 film audience its fast violent explosive and has just enough humor in it to remind you that its not taking itself just too seriously it may be hard to believe but if this isnt going to be the best movie of the summer then were in for one of the most memorably summers ever    55
May 16 2015,positive,amazing cinematography stunts makeup and car design if you are a fan of the fast  furious movies but also dream of one day attending burning man this is the movie for you lacks an actual story  major suspense points involve cars breaking down in the desert movie was decent but for me didnt live up to the hype all of the glowing reviews have given it
May 16 2015,positive,mad max fury road is a modern day action masterpiece i cannot praise  tom hardy charlize theron and the rest of the cast for creating such an amazing film and of course the incredible george miller mad max fury road is an absolute marvel in presentation characters and most importantly action i think its best for me to leave it there because as you can tell mad max fury road is an absolutely incredible film which will go down in the books for a very long time 55
May 16 2015,positive,more crunch than a violet crumble it is a violent crumble
May 16 2015,positive,its well made as a movie but it was underwhelming not my kind of movie i guess the high critic ratings and user ratings convinced me to watch it even though is wasnt thrilled by the preview
May 16 2015,positive,my new favorite movie
May 16 2015,positive,awesome movie not as good as the road warrior but very close great action sequences
May 16 2015,positive,an absolute roller coaster of an action movie some ropey plotting but you dont care about that  its high octane drama with a somewhat progressive message awesome
May 16 2015,positive,easily the best action movie i have ever seen
May 16 2015,positive,2 hours of movie 1h 45 of epic action scenes george miller knows his business
May 16 2015,positive,loved it everything about it    action sequences are outstanding takes you back a few years when movies were filmed and not developed in an office on a screen somewhere    mad max fury road does everything for the mad max fans of old    as usual tom hardy is fantastic and charlize is looking good even with one arm
May 16 2015,positive,just about the best action film in the last couple years
May 16 2015,positive,an action film as there hasnt been in years with a modest cost of  100 million for the genre  without abuse of cgi  photography camera  action  music sequence  all right  the plot continuation of previous movies with a slight limp of screenplay own of the genre quite acceptable
May 16 2015,positive,oh yeah miller still has it totally metal
May 16 2015,positive,rotten tomatoes not working so heres a quick text review    mad max fury road is a spectacular breathtaking ride and one of if not the best action movie in the past decade or more yes it is better than most if not all of the cg heavy marvel movies more fun than the batman movies with the possible exception of the dark knight and maybe even better than serenity    mad max is flawless it has not one but two powerful protagonists a metric shitton of car stunts and explosions fantastic cinematography and a guy suspended by rubber straps playing a flamethrowing bassguitar combo it is flawlessly paced exquisitely castthe soundtrack is one of the best semidiegetic ones in history the practical effect work on the cars and weapons is the kind of thing that would give younger kids wet dreams and best of all the movie is in glorious r and tom hardy is possibly a better mad max than gibson despite having to share the spotlight with an interesting character who actually has an arc    usually i would deconstruct the plot obsess over trivia did you know that the guy who plays immortan joe is the same guy who played toecutter in the fist mad max praise the acting or delve into the nittygritty of production side aspects but there is no point mad max fury road is a masterpiece one of the gamechanging industryshaking action movies and ill let it speak for itself
May 16 2015,positive,the road warrior 1981 met the hills have eyes 1979 and birthed a hyperviolent cirque du soleil show
May 16 2015,positive,a stunning cinematic event
May 16 2015,negative,if you told me this film was made by a 10 year old id believe you great cars loud music and half dressed girlsdont get me wrong the cinematography was fantastic pointless but fantastic i cant comment on the plot you need to have a story or even a weak premise to have a plot there was none other than lets drive across the desert and then back again     the original film was a great movie this is a sad cashin that doesnt deserve your attention not only do i want my money back i want two hours of my life back too
May 16 2015,positive,mad max was a very solid movie  there was hardly any weak spots rarely was there a break in the action and the main characters had a strong presence on screen  the film was very bizarre and filled with more then a handful of weird creepy characters and scenes  if you want a great story this one is not for you  it is very basic and to the point and the entire thing takes place in vehicles driving across a vast deserted desert world  the action is frequent and intense and filled with crazy car battles with fire blood gore and even a guitarist strapped to the front of a truck playing rock music while flames shoot out from his instrument   the title character max had very few lines and grunted the ones he did have but it left his character with a very mysterious background that i hope they focus on in sequels charlize theron stole the show however and was amazing in every aspect  i throughly enjoyed the film but it was tough because you are thrown into this crazy world with no explanation of what is going on and why  mad max will please action enthusiasts but if you dont like your movies a little weird and strange look elsewhere
May 16 2015,positive,i think i have just seen one of the films of the year it simply doesnt matter that the script is so thin this film is pedal to the metal pure adrenaline from start to finish i actually found myself holding my breath at the final scene it was so intense bloody awesome go and watch it now
May 16 2015,positive,brilliantly bonkers loved it
May 16 2015,positive,mad max fury road is everything i couldve dared to hope for a twisted masterpiece of such operatic beauty i was put in awe over and over again surprisingly miller saves us from seeing most of the gore and violence but the characters are so desperate the stakes so high that each punch feels like a sledgehammer
May 16 2015,positive,you shall ride eternal shiny and chrome
May 16 2015,positive,one of the most visceral visually dazzling heart pounding highoctane balls to the wall fucking insane action films ive ever seen
May 16 2015,positive,fantastic movie will be buying the blu ray and video game forsure amazing action and characters very well written and directed
May 16 2015,positive,an excellent and very stunning film to watch things start rolling from the beginning and doesnt stop until the end action is top notch given that most of it is practical tom hardy charlize theron and even nicholas hoult give really good performances the story is straight forward and can be lacking in depth but overall this movie doesnt really need to go that deep enough is explained go have a good time with this film now
May 16 2015,positive,such an awesome incredible action movie
May 16 2015,positive,really good movie charlize theron was awesome
May 16 2015,positive,two hours of ravishing madness couldnt even blink
May 16 2015,positive,this movie is amazing the stunts are breathless and the scenes are jaw dropping yes mad max is back and this 4th revival installment is back everything in this movie is exactly what an action movie should be its great to know a director that can still pull it off after all these years now a lot of people have been talking about how this movie should really be called mad furiosa and yes its true mad max played by tom hardy does not talk a lot but still does give a good performance the stunts in this movie are so amazing that you really start to think that its all cgi right nope only some scenes where they had to but defiantly not the parts where vehicles are being demolished side by side oh thats real guys i really cannot recommend another film this year than this film yes its early to say that judging from how in 2 months the new star wars movie comes out do i think it will be better i hope its good but this movie is quite un defeat able
May 16 2015,positive,not only a homage to the original but a well made movie on its own rights an epic car chase throught a desert with fine visuals and great acting no hams just great entertainment from start to finish
May 16 2015,positive,what a day what a lovely day indeed my god this film kicked my ass this is what action films have been sorely missing for the past ten years or so imagine if a 12 year old kid circa 1984 got hold of a lot of black tar heroin and fireworks and decided to make a movie but this time with a bigger budget this film is great with some of the best action films ever put to celluloid tom hardy and charlize theron are both terrific as the leads and the film never slows down this is one of the best films so far of 2015 and one of the best of the last several years also can we please get that guitar flamethrower dude in more movies please we seeing this movie pour yourself a cup of gasoline induced goodness cause this is one of the best films of the year
May 16 2015,positive,simply amazing the scenery is to die for the costume design pops out at you and action scenes are nonstop adrenaline pumping guitar playing wicked man guitar as flames fly everywhere if you consider yourself a movie goer of any kind you will go watch this it deserves every praise it gets
May 16 2015,positive,george miller simply nailed it other directors should take note this is how you do it right action packed from the beginning until the end this flick made my heart race ill see it again i have to because for a second i believed i was there in the wasteland fighting for survival a masterpiece in my eyes please go see this movie you wont regret it
May 16 2015,positive,the experience of watching this movie is like a mixture of vicoden viagra and two hot twins a complete dopemine overload what i would imagine a methamphetamine induced dream state to be like ultra violent cockruled dopefueled kill or be killed societal experiment that god fucked up loved it i am not a pussy by anyones standard and this movie makes me know that i dont wanna live in a postapocalyptic cesspool straight out of the mind of george miller fuck no five stars not enough this movie gets six an extra one for the ruthless savior the hateful vengeful bleeding heart furiousa a role theron will be happy to accept an oscar for im sure
May 16 2015,negative,awful  totally awful
May 16 2015,negative,theres not much of a plot i get bored of the car chasing after about an hour of it you wont care who lives or dies in this movie as the dialogue is perhaps a page long in the script the stunt work is fairly awesome however
May 16 2015,positive,insane action extravaganza and one of the best movies of the year so far
May 16 2015,negative,i cant understand the positive reviews for this movie stupid almost nonexistent plot that seemed to just be an excuse for 2 hours of loud noises and things going bang and boom i laughed out loud repeatedly and this wasnt meant to be a comedy to quote rob they spent so much money on effects that there wasnt any left over to hire writers i remember enjoying the original mad max but this a waste of two hours of my life
May 16 2015,positive,interesting with greatoscar worthy cinematography and costumeset design  but honestly it could have been 15 hours instead of 2 hours with just as much if not more of an impact  the intro which is critical at 15 minutes the 1st long action sequence at 4550 minutes the 2nd action sequence at 20 minutes and the ending at 57 minutes  there were some really boring parts in the 1st long action sequence that could have been axed    i did like the simple grass isnt greener type of reference in the movie i thought incorporating that type of symbolism was smart and somewhat unexpected
May 16 2015,positive,a visually stunning  punch in the face adrenaline rush   loved it
May 16 2015,positive,i did not expect to like this one of course the reviews were 100 true and this is a true masterpiece of modern blockbuster cinema vivid gorgeous hallucinatory exhilarating and surprisingly fervently feminist this iteration of mad max is simply exhaustingly brilliantly achingly sublimely epic this is a 2 minute trailer pumped up to 120 minutes and the results are just breathtaking contrary to my foolish preconceptions the endless and sprawling battle scenes dont ever grate but instead continuously enthral and captivate for the entirety of the running time whilst its indeed populated by some excellent performances from hardy theron and hoult and also fizzing with ideas the sheer thrill of fury road is the utterly unimaginable and endlessly creative visual spectacle on screen a rich and beautiful tapestry of colour and carnage unfolding before us no im not exaggerating and yes i typically detest a carnival of explosions usually but this was something else inexplicably invigorating intelligent and frankly impressive this is the exemplar for all blockbusters to worship from this point forward
May 16 2015,positive,youll leave breathless  speechless mad max is the raging bull of modernday action blockbusters and one of the best action films to date buckle up it takes you on a viscerally relentless journey through a postapocalyptic sand world lacking h2o i love this movie it really is a classic action feature similar to what revolutionary classic films did like what breathless did for romance  blade runner did for scifi mad max shows us what action truly is  what so many of todays blockbusters are missing that sense of soul  humanity within the world its so simple and like being dropped into an everyday circumstance of this world  the tension within just another day but a lovely day i love that simplicity of its premise and nature and the inyourface saying this is action driven on cocaine its comicbookie graphic noveltype storytelling grasps your attention like no other film right from the get go  your off  this is what action pictures are meant to do and this tops it off  theres not quite a film like it
May 16 2015,positive,this movie will not get the film literature or industry respect that it deserves but that doesnt stop it from being one of the most successfully ambitious films this year the sheer attention to detail and devotion to genre makes it so much more than your average action film and pushes it more into fullon abstract art territory quite simply put movies this meticulous created with this much care and thought with in particular very minimal reliance on cgi just arent made very often anymore and that is why this one will be way more memorable for film people than it probably will be for most of the population this is not a bad thing of course
May 16 2015,positive,tell everyone to go take a hike and just watch the movie this is the best action movie ever dont listen to anyone just go watch it and decide for yourself never let anyone tell you which movie is best for you and your friends
May 16 2015,positive,george millers epic reboot of the franchise that he himself originated is finally here and you bet your ass it was well worth the wait the film is structured so that it plays out like one extended chase sequence stopping only to change a tire fury road is rich in visual style with landscapes of windswept golden decay sounds of gunfire and roaring engines set the mood the characters are delightfully demented complete with protruding abscesss and tumors head bad guy immortan joe played by road warrior alumni hugh keaysbyrne is a religious zealot whos primary hold on the people involves control over the water which he pumps out from deep within the earth joes followers are painted crazies who are eager to go to their deaths so that they may reach the gates of valhalla for him tom hardy is max rockatansky rugged survivor and man of few words hardy is perfect here he possesses the animal ferocity and the thousand yard stare to boot i wanna say that the real star of the show is charlize theron as imperator furiosa theron is no stranger to shedding her hollywood image in favor of something far grimier here she sports a shaved head and a deadly prosthetic arm rounding out the core cast is nick hoult as nux a down on his luck warboy who sees a chance to become something more the theme is redemption not just for furiosa but for all of the characters max is seeking to right the wrongs of his past by being a force for good the pace is marred ever so slightly by a lagging third act just before the virtuoso final action set piece but it is necessary to at least attain some back story the wardrobe department on this film must have been immense no expense is spared everyone looks beaten down and gnarly this is great stuff folks everything form the zany production design to the ridiculous but mostly practical stunts is top notch i for one couldnt be happier that miller finally decided to take mad max out of retirement
May 16 2015,positive,aaaaaaa i wouldnt have believed a 2 hour car chaserunning gun battle could be so goddamned riveting but it was this movie was exactly what i wanted to see in a mad max movie
May 16 2015,positive,weird wonderful balance between twisted imagination and furious intensity a shiny and chrome poem
May 16 2015,positive,what a film second favourite to road warrior
May 16 2015,positive,mad max fury road is an explosive actionadventure that has character and terrific emotional and visual storytelling the production design is excellent the cinematography excellent and the cast does very well the action is a clear staple with some impressive special effects and stunt choreography is it perfect probably not but i also dont believe in perfection i can pick at things here and there like a lot of movies and while ill let time tell what the legacy of this film will be ill safely say this is a bright spot that proves that great films can still come out of the big movie machine in this day and age and need not any original ideas either fury road is a very simple postapocalypse adventure that is light on story but excels because of great aesthetic filmmaking and retaining a character to it that sets the film apart from the overload of bland similar big budget products that dominate a lot of theatres fury road will certainly grab everyones attention and wake us up to what movies can strive to be it already has
May 16 2015,positive,30 years later george miller nailed it
May 16 2015,positive,i rarely use the word masterpiece when talking about movies but there is no hesitation here mad max fury road is a masterpiece the atmosphere the score the visuals and masterfully pulled off practical effects were the perfect overlay for surprisingly thoughtful worldbuilding that implied more visually than any dialogue exposition could have    it never once tried to be anything other than what it originally sought to bea reckless top speed car chase with interesting and imaginationcapturing characters there wasnt a lot of dialogue but their actions conveyed more about them than most movies manage to say with a script that calls for ten times the dialogue there were no heavy handed political messages that sad internet weirdos calling for a boycott feared there would be and it had the same spirit that the originals did with a bigger budget and bigger stakes     for those complaining that hardy wasnt the main character or didnt have enough lines i implore you to watch the originals for a refresher max is and always has been a narrative ghost who drifts through insane circumstances and watches the struggles of others unfold around him sometimes he fights it sometimes he tries to ignore it but generally his memories point him toward doing the right thing like the viewer max is just a passenger on someone elses insane heavy metal ridefiguratively and in the case of fury road literally    this fast paced series of explosions has immediately solidified itself as possibly the best movie i have ever seen and definitely the best movie i have ever seen in theaters i have zero regrets about seeing this in 3d and recommend that you do too do not miss this in theaters
May 16 2015,positive,meh a lot of noise and great visuals but the story just isnt thereyouve seen this before  max is not even the protagonist in this film which has been dubbed feminist road  he gets his butt handed to him his car stolen and used as a blood donor hood ornament     btw as a father of 4 daughters there is no way  no way  you can drive for a solid day with a car full of women and not stop every 2 hours of someh
May 16 2015,positive,3 stars for the action  should have been rated pg13
May 16 2015,positive,a thrill ride from start to finish the best in the series and tom hardie as max is grate check it out

May 16 2015,positive,hype is real best action flick ive seen out of the 21st century besides maybe the raid 2 i waited 5 years to see this since it was announced and it was worth every minute we will never see a chase scene that rivals the last 20 minutes of the movie for a long time
May 16 2015,positive,unlike the mayweatherpacquiao fight of the century match this movie was actionpacked from start to finish  pure adrenaline rush
May 16 2015,positive,bonkers film  great fun and loads of action
May 16 2015,positive,amazing movie awesome soundtrack
May 16 2015,positive,i rarely give a movie five stars but damn mad max fury road deserved it this is some of the best action i have ever seen in a movie ever this sequel surpasses all the previous films in every way the action is just memorizing seeing tom hardy charlize theron and nicholas holt together on screen is amazing because all three are so different but at the same time the can relate to each other so well the entire cast was brilliant and george miller is truly a mastermind of the cinema this man created this world these characters this plot and constructed the action and ill never be more please with a single mans work than i was with george millers mad max fury road
May 16 2015,positive,absolutely nonstop action throughout the whole movie if your into adventure this one is a must see ill go as far as to say its better than the original mad max movies
May 16 2015,positive,epic in every proportion mad max fury road truly shows not holding anything back brings out the best of filmmakers george miller brought his vision to life  from the set design to the costumes and to the story everything feels like it was made from the heart  everyone put their soul into this and it shows  one of my favorite films of 2015 and probably for years to come  this action at its best  thank you george miller
May 16 2015,positive,the editing visuals cinematography wardrobe and actors transport you to a savage war ridden planet fantastic all the way around by the entire crew a new favorite
May 16 2015,positive,the single best action film since aliens  the best car chase since road warrior  an over the top visual orgy of violence and mayhem  the film will be over for hours and youll still have your jaw on the floor

May 16 2015,positive,woah watched it in 3d and it was amazing the entire time there isnt a single dull moment the action and special effects were amazing definitely suggest watching this in the theater if 3d isnt your thing at least catch it in 2d
May 16 2015,positive,the story was ok kind of confusing but the action was great
May 16 2015,positive,mad max fury road is not only a spectacle to watch its a reminder of just how good movies can still be push all the action aside for one moment the story is a typical tale of what when the strong have the resources and the muscle to suppress the weak but in this is a sense of perspective mm shows us a little as to why people have chosen to follow a false god and why the enemy has become the enemy the whole postapocalyptic world is a fascinating study into what humanity would be forced to do should our planet dry upand it aint pretty what is pretty is the scenery i have never wanted to pause a movie just to explore what i was watching more in my life each car looks like a joint collaboration between ed roth hr giger and a nine year old boy who loves bashing up his hot wheels this is matched by the amazing steampunk inspired wardrobe and then theres the action the first 20 minutes will feel like someone opened your skull poured some radiator fluid in your brain and wired your nerves to a never ending loop of ministrys jesus built my hotrod the editing  lowered frame rate will set you on rails akin to riding the bestscariest roller coaster of your life you want it to stop but you dont the best part of this was knowing that most of the stunts were 100 real director frank miller kept the cg and green screening to a bare bones and just when you dont think you can take another hour and forty minutes of this miller gives your brain and ears a rest to introduce the women of the story they are the real heroes here while beautiful charlize theron and the wives arent just there to pretty up the desert they each bring a story of women who are desperate to escape evil each are powerful and balanced then theres max played by tom hardy max is haunted by a past where his actions or lack thereof follow him relentlessly hes pretty stoic and silent but this isnt to say hes wooden hardy gives max enough emotion for us to understand how messed up the guy is he has the desire to do good but years of running have rusted his ability to care even if bloodthirsty action and muscle cars arent your thing mad max fury road is a chrome and skull encrusted blueprint of how filmmakers can make us fall in love with movies again
May 16 2015,positive,one of the best action movies ive ever seen  anyone who doesnt see this is missing out
May 16 2015,positive,i watch a lot of movies this was the best all year go see mad max 3d its art in story telling

May 16 2015,positive,just go see it saying too much would spoil even the feeling of watching this gem
May 16 2015,neutral,movie plot  they drive down a road  when they get there  they turn back   involves the same action scenes from start to finish  nothing original  a disappointment  original movies much better
May 16 2015,positive,one of those rare movies that is absolutely perfect for its type both as an action movie and as postapocalyptic fiction no matter what you think about the details it demands your respect in the same way that dark knight or the lego movie does everyone else making action movies has been put on notice
May 16 2015,positive,this is a six star movie  welcome back max
May 16 2015,positive,nonstop a fast train of mayhem
May 16 2015,positive,best action movie ever what a thrill ride
May 16 2015,neutral,the cinematography editing and old school effects are brilliant but the threadbare plot dialogue and the films inability to decide upon a main character makes this nothing more than eye popping chase scenes if thats what youre going for then you wont be disappointed but it is laughable to call this a great film by the way blood transfusions can be fatal if you give someone the wrong blood you cant just hook up an iv and hope you make a match that alone makes the ending ridiculous and unrealistic
May 16 2015,positive,once i got past the underlying belief that mel gibson isnt actually playing in this movie and it is in fact tom hardy i settled into my seat and took in the new experience having grew up with the original mad max in the 80s i had high expectations action violence crazy scenes and grit lots of grit this movie definitely had each of those components and then some highly recommend this movie
May 16 2015,positive,this movie was awesome it had great action and great acting it lacked a little in story telling though this is every action movie lovers dream it was extremely action packed if youre looking for just a good story though this isnt for you i was hooked the whole time i didnt find myself looking at my watch every 5 minutes like i do with some movies this movie is better than avengers 2 go see it
May 16 2015,positive,amazing film  it is a mad max film  i hope they make a sequel or prequel of it
May 16 2015,positive,the best movie 2015 will produce and perhaps the most entertaining movie i have ever seen this is a movie that will live on well beyond its theater showcase
May 16 2015,negative,no plot to speak of no character development if you didnt know the characters ahead of time youd have no idea what going on or why basically lots of chases car crashes and not much else
May 16 2015,negative,not worth seeing adds nothing new and incorporates all the bad
May 16 2015,positive,intense facemelting action that somehow brings some feels along for the ride 9510
May 16 2015,positive,non stop action from start to finish if you liked the old ones then you will love this one
May 16 2015,negative,not enough ax in this movie old ones are far better
May 16 2015,positive,knocking it down half a star because i saw it in theaters and it was way too loud uncomfortably so
May 16 2015,positive,mad max fury road is directed by george miller and its absolutely incredible it is one of the best action movie ever made the cinematography is absolutely stunning and the practical and special effects are brilliant tom hardy is a vulnerable hero who you care deeply for every character who is not a villain you care for and charlize theron is unbelievable it is balls to the wall crazy and is fuing awesome
May 16 2015,positive,pardon the pun but absolutely mad bad and dangerous mostly action from the start to the finish acting ting amazing and visually superb great stuff watch it wont be disappointed
May 16 2015,positive,10 out of 10    an action packed film and an amazing continuation of the trilogy
May 16 2015,negative,absolutely the worst movie ive ever seen i was so excited about this one and it sucked the best parts were the chasebattle scenes those were amazing anything in between was painful tom hardys dialogue was grunt here groan there literally until the last 10 minutes when he had probably 4 lines and finally said my name is max i left early after that sucked
May 16 2015,neutral,total action packed movie   unfortunately we have seen it all before  however all the stunts green screen and cgi are top notch with a solid story that was well told its worth seeing its entertaining  but if your looking for depth look elsewhere
May 16 2015,positive,having never seen the original movies i was not quite sure what to expect but from the 1st scene and on i was hooked george miller is an eccentric crazy old man who has a beautiful and horrifying dream of a postapocalyptic world this movie is truly stunning with the sun beating down upon the golden desert sands there isnt much dialogue which is always upsetting to me but when it comes to this movie the little bit of dialogue is perfect to pull the story along with the action definite must watch this year
May 16 2015,positive,spectacular visually amazing awesome screenplay with great story telling  fast and furious franchise should take a note from this movie its a crazy 2 hour ride of madness and action and thrill
May 16 2015,positive,as action movies go this is as good as it gets if sheer adrenaline is what you want mad max fury road delivers pure stuff ands brings the highest art of cinematography makeup design and above all editing bravo george miller
May 16 2015,positive,the best action movie this year  charlize does it again for me  this was really a furiosa movie  not a mad max movie  but tom hardy was great though too
May 16 2015,positive,yeah if you like big screen action with people not super heroesyoure gonna want to see this one
May 16 2015,positive,oh what a film what a lovely film
May 16 2015,positive,perfect everything it needed to be and clearly what miller always wanted to do even years before technology and budget would allow
May 16 2015,positive,undoubtedly millers magnum opus  a destructive symphony of petroleum fueled mayhem and vehicular carnage  overwhelmingly full of heart pumping nonstop actionand yet not entirely devoid of character and story
May 16 2015,positive,oh what a day what a lovely dayinsanely awesome
May 16 2015,positive,it had its moments lots of fun action and amazing artificial effects the road warrior still remains as my personal favorite but i think this will remain as  one of the coolest summer action movie spectacles  hardy as max  he was cool
May 16 2015,positive,very good film  actors all did well and the visuals are amazing   the only thing missing from me was back story  i had no clue how these people got to this point in their lives
May 16 2015,positive,you should not be watching any other film until this comes out on bluray   then you may watch this and blade runner   an amazing achievement ½
May 16 2015,negative,not entirely sure what all the fuss was about on this one less than impressed
May 16 2015,positive,just saw mad max fury road last night  went in not expecting a lot never saw the original movies and was blown away by it inspired art direction great pacing considering that almost the entire film is a car chase and some very strong female characters  which almost never happens in a movie it actually passes the beschdel test theres a reason it has 98 percent on rotten tomatoes refreshing to see such a strange movie with a clear vision being made with such a large budget i wish this crew was doing some of the big superhero movies  oh and they completely cut mel gibson out of the script 
May 16 2015,positive,a 100 action movie for all the movie lovers  its pure brilliance
May 16 2015,positive,believe the hype fury road is a kick in the nuts and george millers magnum opus the 70 year old filmmaker gives an action film masterclass to all those hollywood wannabe blockbuster directors and they better up their game all around one of the best big film experiences i had in the last couple of years that is not afraid to invest in character development in the most deliberately subtle ways that only an intelligent filmmaker can do charlize theron steals the show with her incredible female warrior character and tom hardy proves a worthy successor to gibsons mad max cant wait for what mr miller has next up his sleeve and whatever it is i want first seats ps the practical fx feel like a breath of fresh ear in this cgi dominated era
May 16 2015,positive,bat hit crazy brilliant beautiful disaster  amazingly grotesque and oh so lovely
May 16 2015,positive,drop everything and see this movie now  it absolutely lives up to the hype  an amazing visual spectacle with a simple but amazingly touching story at its heart
May 16 2015,positive,this just became the movie to beat this summer
May 16 2015,positive,with breathtaking scenery and two badass main protagonists mad max fury road is a great action film that while it runs thin on its plot still manages to bring you adrenaline and intensity with perfectly crafted action pieces again the plot isnt much but its what you would expect from such an insane world and yes its an insane film the character of max is pretty silent but he was portrayed brilliantly by tom hardy max is always beaten on almost every scene but he doesnt give up and that is what you call a great hero charlize theron plays a really good role as furiosa while this movie is called mad max it feels like furiosa is the main character yet again it doesnt really bother because she is an awesome heroine the character of nux played by nicholas hoult is very interesting as he is insane and he adds a surprising amount of emotional weight in this film that while it doesnt hit hard it does kind of work mad max fury road is a highly entertaining and great action film that while it was sort of overhyped it still remained to be one of the best films of 2015 im giving this film a 910 a 90 a 455 and an a
May 16 2015,positive,its a continuation of the mad max saga but definitely feels like a reboot  thats a good thing tom hardy is asked to play the mad part unlike mr gibson who played the character before going mad and plays it well however what steals the show is the role of women and the theme of redemption not to mention the use of stuntmen and limited dependence on green screen the action is virtually nonstop and over the top  thank you worth it to see it in 3d for the scenery and the stunts
May 16 2015,positive,i saw mad max fury road on its opening night here in canada and i can honestly say that it was the best action movie i have seen since the dark knight the action was incredible and used next to no cgi the acting was great and story compelling it had very intense moments throughout that kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time i suggest that everyone sees this movie cause it is well worth it best action movies time
May 16 2015,positive,visually stunning mad max fury road is one helluva movie that gives us a frenetic and frightening postapocalyptic landscape while nodding to the resulting gender politics in said landscape the movie balances itself between subtle almost absurd humor and the severity of the situation similarly the movie shows disturbing images and storylines of misogyny women being reduced to procreative functions from forced breeders to forced suppliers of mothers milk while itself not being a misogynistic movie as a result this powerful tension highlights the utter ugliness of misogyny and hatreddistrust of women     the cinematography is downright stunning with the barren desert landscapes ginormous mudflats and evocative night skies dotted with stars and the speededup film in select scenes creates a wonderful frenetic tension in the viewers frankly this movie is amazing and one ill happily watch many times
May 16 2015,positive,carnage epic high concept depressing maddening hopeless mad max delivers     dont expect a lot of plot twists or clever dialogue you will have a strange indescribable feeling in your stomach the whole time    you will be entering another world where your logic doesnt belong     see this movie if you are fine with those things
May 16 2015,positive,lights camera full throttle    mad max is ridiculously satisfying its like going to your favourite bakery  getting to eat all your favourite desserts at once george miller takes you out of the reallife miserable apocalyptic world outside the theatre and submerges your heart soul  adrenaline into the newage cgiinfused full throttle highly saturated ozploitation extravaganza within the first minute of the moviethis should be the encyclopedia for all modernday action films id love to see the uncut version hoping itd have a little more blood splattering all around     its absolutely delicious go treat your senses
May 16 2015,positive,takes actionadventure to a whole new level
May 16 2015,positive,90s style action is back
May 16 2015,positive,mad max fury road is worth a watch no spoilers for you if youre interested in seeing it but the plot is simple and the characters are onpoint enough to draw you into their world its campy and charming my favorite part of the movie the couple brief physical fight scenes were really well choreographed in my opinion best b movie ive ever seen in my life
May 16 2015,positive,intense but i felt like i needed subtitles in some parts why cant i never understand tom hardy
May 16 2015,positive,a singular transcendent directorial vision invigorating relentless breathtaking to behold a masterclass in action filmmaking in which a 71 yearold australian  director gives a fully extended middle finger to all the sloppy cgiaddicted hacks that have been making action films for the past two decades yes im talking to you michael bay you notalent assclown in a brilliant move miller turns the macho action film paradigm on its head yes tom hardy is very very good as the eponymous max but this is charlize therons show as imperator furiosa she drives tee hee the action of this film shes a woman who can proudly take her place next to elanor ripley and buffy summers and the rest of them and by the time we meet a motorcycle gang of grandmothers turned snipers its clear that the women are the strong ones in this apocalyptic world that miller has brilliantly realized and as for the actionwhich is about 100 minutes of the films 120 minute runtimeyouve never seen anything like it this is no infantile cgifest miller goes oldschool and has real men clinging to real cars zipping around the nambian desert it makes all seven fast and furious movies combined look like driving miss daisy best of all the geography of the action is 100 clear at all times you never wonder who is fighting whom in relation to what i cant wait to see it again
May 16 2015,neutral,lots of explosions and actionnot much for dialogue ok movie considering i never got into the older ones
May 16 2015,positive,i feel like this is the best movie ive ever seen
May 16 2015,positive,badass beautiful fun but i would have loved a lot more character development and time spent with the gorgeous world and people they created its just two hours of explosions while driving
May 16 2015,negative,not sure what the buzz is all about there were several times in the movie where the audience busted out laughing because it was so stupid those times were not intended to be funny dont spend more than the 1 at those boxes around town for this one
May 16 2015,positive,breathe taking i dont think ive seen a movie with this much action that works so well since raiders of the lost ark i dont say this ofteninstant classic
May 16 2015,positive,max is back incredible movie in every way
May 16 2015,positive,the perfect recreation of the original road warrior with just enough of the new technology to make it up to date
May 16 2015,positive,what a day what a lovely day
May 16 2015,negative,i grew tired of this movie after 10 minutes  a foolish movie with little to no direction and non stop violence
May 16 2015,positive,what a movie something different creating a different perspective for modern cinema enhanced format that displays chase sequences unlike any other movie ive seen  with a recipe of originality combined with caos  laced with a full shot of adrenaline makes this movie worth every second of the 120 min length so good you may want to watch it again later in the day
May 16 2015,positive,the best blockbuster since inception exceptional piece of art
May 16 2015,positive,best film of 2015 put it in the books
May 16 2015,negative,charlize theron helps 5 victorias secret models escape a nasty leader with a grunting tom hardy along for the ride this was one of the dumbest movies ive ever seen
May 16 2015,positive,i saw this movie last night i first watched the original mad max with mel gibson when i was 10 years old and loved it this one picks up on the still rage consumed riding the dry dessert mad max i love how in this version they delve more into the insanity of mad max played by tom hardy and the way he is haunted by the ghosts of his past you can really see and feel the madness the apocalyptic world has done to its surviving citizens lol guitar guy gives you a sense of eeriness and coolness all at the same time i also loved charlize theron as furiosa did you get that furiosa spanish word for mad woman lol the car chase through the lighting sand storm was amazing as well real action scenes bring you the old school movie vibe that i for one really miss now a day all in all i loved the movie 
May 16 2015,positive,maybe if you thought you were going to see the second best marigold hotel and wandered into the wrong theater you might not enjoy this otherwise i cant imagine how you couldnt love it seriously a crazy ride through visual and audio overload felt like a roller coaster you strap in have about 30 seconds of calm as you climb up the first hill and then its on and just like a roller coaster i want to hop right back on to experience it again i preordered the movie for home already
May 16 2015,positive,mute max isnt really the star of this overblown and overlong show but still enjoyable
May 16 2015,positive,this 30 years old franchise has eventually roared its way returning to the big screen with a greater filming technology and a bigger budget though the same director after so many years george miller still succeeds in bringing another great entertaining sequel that is worth waiting for its epic action sequences and spectacular visual effects setting in future the plots apocalyptic society and sexual politics are pretty straightforward combining the insanity hyperaccelerating and exhilarating actions without repetition of styles all are presented in a creative way which is rarely seen in recent films while its not necessary anyway the film does not have much of characters development but both tom hardy and charlize theron as well as the presence of nicholas hoult have a great screen time of heroic performances meanwhile musics by junkie xl sound loud tremendous and powerful likely influenced by hans zimmers style surprisingly suit the film well including the cool and classic cinematography by john seale miller is able to deliver more than what audiences might be expecting even with overdose f action scenes it is still effectively balanced with emotional moments and inspiring messages
May 16 2015,positive,awesome movie soundtrack was definitely high octane action packed acting was great
May 16 2015,positive,yaay crazy this is it
May 16 2015,positive,this movie was bananas maybe not as good as the road warrior but twice as trippy and as intense
May 16 2015,negative,over rated waste of money and time i could have written that lousy screenplay acting was nonexistent no character depth just horrible
May 16 2015,positive,dont blink too much or you will miss a lotperfect cinema experience
May 16 2015,positive,heartpounding almost overstimulating picture with some badass characters and nonstop action
May 16 2015,positive,it is an intense thrill ride from start to finish with a few warm human moments tossed in
May 16 2015,positive,hes had 30 years to think about it wow is only faint praise
May 16 2015,positive,it is visually spectacular but is lacking in dimension it is not bad but you should know what youre going to see a balls to the wall action fest
May 16 2015,positive,victoria secret angels in action
May 16 2015,positive,whoa the reviews are just pouring in like anything and all have nothing to say but the best for the movie i guess i will have to shift it now to the top of my towatch list
May 16 2015,positive,mad max fury road is action filmmaking at its finest 2hours of straight chaos explosions and too top it off its visually stunning
May 16 2015,positive,felt like max had less screen time compared to furiosa they shouldve named it adventures of max and furiosa nevertheless fury road shows fast n furious franchise how action movies should be amazing movie
May 16 2015,positive,epic visual masterpiece but you better like driving movies because ultimately thats all youre watching for two and a half hours
May 16 2015,positive,after a hiatus of 30 years mad max fury road the fourth installment of director george millers mad max franchise is finally on the big screen and the interminable wait is justified boasting electrifying action sequences with terrific pyrotechnics and stupendous practical effects this film is highoctane adrenaline rush from start till end the entire film is in essence a protracted chase sequence with a straightforward plot max tom hardy is taken as a prisoner and relegated to the role of universal donor aka blood bag to the sick war boys expendable kamikazes under the despotic rule of depraved tyrant immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne during a chase to reclaim said fascists five wives  concubines specifically selected to breed the next generation of war boys from imperator furiousa charlize theron max found himself free of war boy nuxs nicholas hoult captivity and formed an alliance with furiousa to find safe passage out of the barren wastelands to the promised green place mayhem ensues as immortan joes dark forces close in hot on the heels of the escape party the exhilarating action set pieces are undoubtedly the highlights of the movie which are seamlessly complemented with tourdeforce performances from the cream cast tom hardy and charlize theron the latter especially in a deeply moving portrayal of the anguished furiousa the tortured heroine who also happens to be a victim of circumstance special mention too to hugh keaysbyrne in his unnerving act as immortan joe a machiavellian with a godcomplex who seeks to reshape the world in his fashion despite the simple narrative the movie strives to be an ecoparable with implicit cautionary messages on consumerism and the world resource depletion while also drawing parallels to realworld global issues such as the oil war and the viability of state sovereignty under a monarchy regime a galvanizing original that is at once bold emotionally engaging and dazzling to behold mad max fury road is one hell of a bravura ride not to be missed
May 16 2015,negative,how is this movie getting such high ratings  there was no plot no good dialogue and very boring  fell asleep twice during the showing
May 16 2015,positive,mad max is pure brilliance george miller may have been away from the genre for decades but his return is one of a true master come back to show the new school how to use their digital tools properly simply the most outrageous carnage beautifully presented on a canvas of stunning cinematography miss this at your own stupidity
May 16 2015,positive,2hrs of pure action doesnt focus on mad max at all but pretty much everybody else didnt like it that much
May 16 2015,positive,pick all all the crazy people from each statesfor diversity  make their leader one of like raj thackrey  empty out the whole up and put all of them together but this time fighting over gasoline you will automatically gets a great choreographed and cinematic shot full badass movie
May 16 2015,positive,it is rare for reboots and remakes of classic or at least kind of memorable intellectual properties to not be conceived by major hollywood studios as a scheme to make a cheap profit without any regard to quality how about for a reboot to entirely stand on its own as of a week ago i could think of two casino royale and the dark knight   and out from the bare and beautiful desert rides film mastermind that is what they call him in the trailer george miller revving his armed armored nitrospitting vehicle of a film mad max fury road which i can safely call the best action movie of the decade possibly this century here miller employs a refreshingly streamlined narrative as the foundation of some of the craziest practical combat sequences entirely inventive set machine and sound design and surprisingly deep performances all combined to rewrite the rules of action filmmaking  once a mighty road warrior max tom hardy lives in a post apocalyptic desert reduced to only a single instinct survival when he is captured to be used as a human blood bag by the warboys under the command of immorten joe a ruthless warlord who controls his people by controlling the entire water supply when he allows his citizens to drink he releases a waterfall upon his people telling them not to get addicted to the water when one of the war boys that he gives blood to sets to capture a rogue imperator of joes max becomes chained to the front of a spiked automobile in the midst of spectacular vehicular warfare it is on this conquest that he meets the infamous imperator furiosa charlize theron the one under pursuit of the warboys after stealing joes sex slaves the wives to take them to the green place a supposed land full of life and liberty after being freed from his shackles by furiosa and the wives max reluctantly agrees to help them travel to the green place while being chased relentlessly across miles of desert   the plot never takes any ambitious twists and turns but it never really needs to especially considering how much storytelling is executed through nonverbal means the sandsoaked horizon the offroad vehicles that look as if they were taken apart and put back together again with bigger engines and more spikes and the primitive one tracked nature of each character provides everything that needs to be known about the environment miller implies countless stories about each character with little to no exposition and because the main characters of max and furiosa have been assembled and presented with such care the performances especially therons become much more powerful it is almost as if the atmosphere around the characters has eroded them so much that they have lost any use for speech and seeing such a beautiful thing lost to a world man has inflicted upon himself really hurts on a level that no dialogue could possibly explain   for the first time since ihavenoideawhen we have practical effects on the big screen the entire movie was filmed on location in the namib desert of southern africa and all of the automobiles were entirely functional because these sequences are filmed in real time with actors performing highly dangerous stunts such as vaulting from one moving car to the next on 30 foot poles they have an energy and risk surrounding them with twice the thrills of a film largely shot in a green screened room that will be saturated in cgi when post production approaches even scenes that have to be computer generated such as a blood red sandstorm that the warboys fearlessly enter exclaiming what a lovely day in insanity stricken jubilee are believable because cast and crew fully commit to millers vision refusing to let such a monumental concept ever feel cheap the cinematography captures the action in all its colorful glory never masking any loose ends of stunt work or pyrotechnics   most importantly the film travels quickly while still retaining a shape and a core for all of its explosions and heavy metal guitar players rocking out on top of a roaring armored car with a flamethrower attached to the guitars neck the movie has dynamics when a sequence ends it gracefully fades out into quiet allowing time to contemplate over the destruction and the endless desert ahead as well as a moment to study the complex predicament that max furiosa and the wives face when the camera sweeps through immorten joes armada individual motors and warboys fade in and out of the mix according to the cameras position when gunfire pierces brief tranquility it does not oppress the movie from each direction but rather it occurs in one corner of the theater and crescendos into the movies next event a filmmakers job is to make use of light and sound to create art and millers new film is crafted in those terms to the absolute highest caliber   some may call mad max fury road a dumb hollywood action flick they may call it one giant action scene but even if it does not require heavy brain activity to enjoy even if it has extensive expertly crafted combat sequences it certainly has a purpose fury road is hope in the midst of hopelessness a world where battered individuals will travel for hundreds of days to reach a land that might not even be there at the end of the journey in many ways george millers struggles with this films production which went on for sixteen years parallels max and furiosas journey to the green place miller had no idea whether or not his efforts to make this film would ever pay off let alone if the movie would ever finish production fortunately for him and moviegoers alike fury road pays off in every definition of the term it is classic moviemaking at its best and an unforgettable film going experience     grade a

May 16 2015,positive,i had to rethink my rating and bumped it up a little
May 16 2015,positive,one of the best action flicks ive seen in a long time definitely a movie 2 go see
May 16 2015,negative,couldnt wait to see it so disappointing that after an hour i couldnt wait for it to end 20 minutes later i had to walk out what a waste of time

May 16 2015,positive,just when you thought youve seen all the postapocalyptic dystopian society films and fast and furious car stunts mad max fury road redefines the genre gloriously and also makes one hark back to 1981 and watch the original the road warrior
May 16 2015,positive,beyond awesome tom hardy is perfect the guitarist was everything  and although furiosa was a good character to bring into the mix for the first installment i hope they continue the franchise with different characters every time and focus more on hardys complex brilliance incredible film on so many levels
May 16 2015,positive,mad max fury road is an amazing new addition to the franchise that is impressive in every way the cinematography is terrific the performances are excellent the direction is fantastic and the action scenes spectacular one of the best action movies in a long time
May 16 2015,positive,the original mad max and road warrior is still the best but this movie def stacks up well
May 16 2015,positive,still speechless  best movie ever  non stop action for 2 hours
May 16 2015,positive,an explosive ride filled with action heart and great acting this is a relentless unstoppable piece of filmmaking that keeps surprising you more as it goes on simply an instant classic
May 16 2015,positive,amazingly fun to watch having never seen the others i was skeptical at first however it makes no little to no difference movie is great as is
May 16 2015,positive,one of the best action movies i ever saw
May 16 2015,positive,if the new star wars movie doesnt have this kind of attention to detail then i will be sad  great cinematography sound editing and mixing costumes and artwork fun action well used but not oversaturated cgi well written and well acted  when the creators initially pitched this idea this film reboot should have been dead in the water but instead it has exceeded my expectations on how a mad max movie should be executed in 2015
May 16 2015,positive,holy cow what a ridiculously over the top awesome spectacle action film dragging the wife to go see it with me this morning
May 16 2015,positive,a well done action movie blown heavily out of proportion it is nice to see practically effects used compared to the smorgasbord of special effects and cgi we see these days but ironically avengers age of ultron had me far more engaged and i had far more fun with that or by comparison if we are talking about a movie that actually puts the last decade of action movies to shame the raid would be the ultimate example
May 16 2015,positive,one of the best action movies ive ever seen  a very bizarre and entertaining ride throughout the whole movie gotta see it in the threatre
May 16 2015,negative,if youre into old cars being modified with roaring engines nothing like fast and furious then youll probably like this movie this movie was nothing but run and catch up repeatedlyand then run and catch up again two stars for the cool effects overall there was absolutely no story behind it like the old mad max wait for it when netflix gets its hands on it
May 16 2015,positive,a true legend already mad max fury road not only beats its predecessors but it becomes one of the most exuberant and enthralling action films of the decade and maybe of all time an absolute masterpiece
May 16 2015,positive,solid fucking gold i left the theater and decided to burn everything id ever written my movie collection and my netflix account whats the point anymore movies are over
May 16 2015,positive,ducking amazing go ducking see it now surpassed all my expectations
May 16 2015,positive,amazing non stop action
May 16 2015,positive,its been 30 years since max left us in the big screen now he comes back with a new actor portraying the lone wolf from mel gibson in which he had established 36 years ago while the film may look like furiosas story maxs character holds on his own and shows that there are men who do selfless things without any thought of reward nothing but the silent respect that women should give and acknowledge and when you do theyre gonegoing their own way
May 16 2015,positive,mad max fury road is a lot of fun to watch but i didnt think it was worth the 10 nominations that the film was up for including best picture and i dont think the film shouldve won the 6 awards that it did like of course the film is fun to watch but its not a work of art other than that here are some positive aspects of the film tom hardy in my opinion was 100 times better than mel gibson even though hardy barely talks throughout the film however its charlize theron steals the show as furiosa in my opinion though i really enjoyed the character of nux nicholas hoult i thought his character brought some necessary comedic relief through the film though fury road has some positive and negative aspects to the film its still a lot of fun to watch but if you arent fine with weird looking characters car chases or heavy action sequences i dont recommend the film to you however if you are fine with all that stuff then give it a try you might not be disappointed
May 16 2015,negative,if the blue man group was laid off and had nothing to do but make an action film you would have this show some of the scenes are choreographed with like colleges battle the problem is that theyre too many scenes like that  i need just a little more story not a blue man group battle opera
May 16 2015,positive,wow dont bother seeing any other action movie this summer  nothing is going to top this  in fact  if youre going to see any movie at the theater this year see mad max fury road  this movie reminds us why we go to the movies in the first place  its an instant classic and i cant wait to see it again
May 16 2015,positive,excellent film must see in 3d fantastic
May 16 2015,positive,the thrill doesnt come from the amazing action setpieces and kills it comes from how a film with such a cheesy title manages to undercut tiresome genre tropes while offering a grotesque spectacle without being a bloated monstrosity  theres barely any story or dialogue and yet it still works michael bay start taking notes
May 16 2015,positive,you will have an epic day when you see this film
May 16 2015,positive,the 30 year wait was well worth it  this movie gives you all you want and more
May 16 2015,positive,finally a movie with cars in it thats not using a bunch of cgi  stuntman doing real stunts sort of believable unlike that crap fast and furious 7 george miller still has it
May 16 2015,negative,i know it is an action movie but there really wasnt much of a story in this movie  i probably had raised expectations because of the review but i was underwhelmed
May 16 2015,positive,shiny and chrome and rewards at the gates of valhalla for this one
May 16 2015,negative,i went into this moving not expecting much besides 2 hours of wild driving through barren desert landscapes and spoiler alert didnt get much more than that  tom hardys acting appeared and disappeared more than charlize therons grease makeup  the hot wives and old ladies in the movie were annoying and confusing as was trying to keep up with who is dead dying or totally fine after each car crash and knife wound  trying to sneak past a war party would be easy if done at night but for some reason the group tries to do it during bright daytime  the films action is directly masterfully and the fast motion camera and experimental editing might work in a 15 million independent film but is a distraction in a 150 million blockbuster  the movie tries to be overlyweird cutting out babies from pregnant models but the only weird thing about it is that dennis hopper never shows up to claim this dry land for himself  not sure if this was a sequel prequel remake or a sahara desert commercial but they shouldve left the crazy to 1980s mel gibson
May 16 2015,positive,if fast and furious had imagination taste weird mutants and a great soundtrack
May 16 2015,positive,what a crazy ride an amazingly creative over the top rock opera daring you to somehow take your eyes off it a triumph of what an action movie can and should be with some of the most clear action scenes ive ever seen this movie has so many stunts that could have been the highlight of any other movie but it just keeps out doing itself amazing ride that doesnt let go until the credits roll
May 16 2015,positive,often reboots of movie franchises that ended with tepidlacking sequels are a bit like really do we need this superman returns for instance or any of the newer spiderman movies then theres mad max fury road mel gibson was mad max and mad max 2 is a great great movie but tom hardy takes the role adds what he does in his movies and takes the role of max to only a place he could he perfectly plays the loner with good intentions charlize theron is as much a major role in this movie as tom hard is and adds as much in the role as he does intact at some points i thought theron was the star of the movie the story itself is not weighed down by overly complicated or deep story telling its too the point and then we get down to the action its pulsating its exciting its nonfucking stop for 2 hours you are literally assaulted with action explosions fights and having your breath taken away you will leave the cinema blue after watching this its a brilliant take on mad max its an amazing comic book movie that delivers a story action and satisfaction in huge amounts loved it
May 16 2015,positive,mad max the reluctant hero rides again    moody and fast paced    as good as the others in the series
May 16 2015,positive,its definitely my husband favourite film in 2015tons and tons of gasoline bombing up and lots lots people with funny face makeup for dramatic effectoverall its fun to watch something blow up your face and in the ears once in a while 
May 16 2015,positive,vin diesel would look at the cars in this and be like naw man im going home
May 16 2015,positive,after spending most of the night processing this amazing movie i have decided that this is the best actionadventure film with a female lead i have ever seen charlize theron put on an amazing performance as furiosa she was stoic strong driven yet passionate and caring the movie took me so much by surprise by purposely turning stereotypes and common hollywood themes on their heads what pleased me most was that all of this was done with minimal dialog amazing car chases unbelievable special effects fabulous costumes and spectacular cinematography do not miss this in the theater it is worth seeing it on the big screen in all of its glory congratulations george miller it is clear you did your homework here you knew what hollywood had been missing and you delivered
May 16 2015,positive,action packed interesting production design and a halfway decent story that ties it all together
May 16 2015,positive,fucking amazing hands down the best action film of the 10s
May 16 2015,positive,its well over 35 years since aussie director george miller launched mel gibsons career with mad max a microbudget nearfutureset revenge pic which remains one of the most profitable films in history now with the kind of backing one only gets off the back of a successful franchise about dancing penguins miller cuts loose with alist stars in tom hardy and charlize theron along with all the vehicles he could ever wish to detonate    and what a glorious ludicrous demented living videogame hes come up with    its a world where in spite of the title hardtack uberstoic max is about the sanest thing going where in spite of an apparent lack of ammunition its quite acceptable for former wrestler nathan jones chin covered in latex like some sort of jacked up refugee from bo selecta to randomly fire a minigun into the air for no discernible reason and where in spite of the rarity of fossilbased energy warlords under no circumstances would dream of heading into battle unless their lead vehicle is fronted with a rack of speakers that would make metallica blush and a skullfaced loon in a red onesie hammering out power chords on a doublenecked guitar that belches flames    while subtlety is absolutely not the order of the day action is and for all the avengers citylevelling cgiheavy destruction fury roads vehicular mayhem is infinitely more satisfying bone crunching and exhilarating than most summers full of blockbusters can manage between them     although the plot puts the guff into macguffin it doesnt matter its just one fistpumping set piece after another as max and co lay waste to a colourful rogues gallery of baddies with each successive sequence somehow outdoing the last with incredible displays of practical effects and stuntwork    with hardy reportedly on board for a trilogy its going to be a lot of fun seeing how miller can top this one
May 16 2015,positive,two insanely highspeed hours of whiplash and pure unapologetic eccentric and overblown violence that left me shocked and full of laughter the soundtrack may have been my favorite character the only thing missing was tons of cgi  thank you george miller
May 16 2015,positive,quoting vince carter after his second dunk in his all star dunk contest its over its over best action movie of the year     updated best movie of the year ive seen the movie seven times on big screen because i know that it wont replicated anywhere this is probably the only film that i appreciate all of the nonaction sequences because the action are so mindblowing and spectacular that i felt it melted my face afterwards i think i hurt my jaw after watching this film
May 16 2015,positive,spectacular action sequences stellar acting and perfectly fitting music
May 16 2015,positive,a absolute balls to the wall action movie insane loved it made me want to see original 3 films again then see this again crazy film in the best way
May 16 2015,positive,that movie was indeed mad non stop craziness from start to finish
May 16 2015,positive,awesome movie it had the same old campy mad max feel  amazing special effects  complete chaos amazing movie all around
May 16 2015,positive,ridiculous absurd brilliant if you ever wondered what a 2 hour long chancestunt sequence is like then this is your chance im not even all that sure what the movie was about but loved it all    given the outcome it is amazing how much room george miller was given to execute his vision here hell the villains travel with their own live theme music cannot go wrong with that imho
May 16 2015,positive,mad max fury road went beyond my expectations from the second it starts to the moment it finished its like this film is on speed less cg stunning costumes crazy makeups why cg it when you can do it for real you leave the theatre with your heart pumping and thumping you will not know what hit you and with thinking one thing on your mind wow i cant think of a film out there that is like this one when it was over i right away wanted to watch it again a must see in 3d   one of the best action movies of the decade this movie proves weve been judging other action movies by too low a standard
May 16 2015,positive,great action movie worthy of viewing on the big screen  if you where a big fan of 2 road warrior a must see  will definitely be purchasing the movie when its for sale and would love a sequel
May 16 2015,positive,it was great fun excited beautifully great addition to the mad max franchise
May 16 2015,positive,see it go 3d if you can
May 16 2015,positive,so far movie of the year only movie worth seeing in 4dx wow
May 16 2015,positive,its perfectlyrealized and amazingly lavish and its mostly for 12 yr old boys filled with smgeared shirtless bodypainted muscled men grossout visuals and a dude with a guitar i was frequently looking at my watch after thirty minutes of it still the action sequences are beautifully choreographed
May 16 2015,positive,pure post apocalyptic punk opera miller takes down the blockbuster business and gives the perfect action movie weve been waiting for all our lives yes its a lovely day for movie lovers and cinema
May 16 2015,positive,great from beginning to end i want more
May 16 2015,positive,no there really is no plot and i dont think tom hardy remembered exactly how to speak but this is just a technically good action film it is pulled off brilliantly and my god are those car chase sequences orgasmic
May 16 2015,negative,furiosa and the five wives of fury road is a piece of shit
May 16 2015,negative,filmmakers did a great job with costume and vehicle designs but they forgot to offer a story plot or any meaningful character development  they could have had a gorilla play tom hardys role considering all he does is grunt his way through the whole thing this movie literally drives itself in a big circle  simply not a road trip worth taking then again if youre a knuckledragging cromagnon who thinks a car movie can wholly run on vin diesel then you might enjoy this as the max and the furious  because thats all this flick really is  a bunch of highoctane straightahead car chases that grow tired after the first 20 minutes  was there even a script or did the actors just ad lib this the whole way through  the original mad maxroad warrior movies were badass and original  this is not
May 16 2015,positive,best nonstop gritty practical epic action movie ive ever seen bar none also the soundtrack and music are top top notch i cannot wait to see this with a group of friends on my home theater
May 16 2015,positive,pure adrenaline i may be old fashioned but i wouldve enjoyed just a touch more of a story or at least setting it up at the beginning before halfway through  but thats just me being picky
May 16 2015,positive,fast cars explosions nonstop action  and guns guys version of a romantic comedy
May 16 2015,positive,i went to the advance screening on wednesday and i must say it was awesome it is the most action packed film of 2015 its a definite must watch movie tom hardy is amazing as max charlize theron is fantastic as furiosa and nicholas holt as nux is literally crazy it was just so good i hope everyone gets a chance to see it
May 16 2015,positive,most of the early reviews for fury road are resoundingly positive even celebratory and it really is a fun ride with some sublimely nightmarish visuals and plenty of the type of antic violence that made the road warrior simultaneously silly and disturbing but youll enjoy fury road more if you manage your expectations solidly entertaining action flick though it may be its no mad max no road warrior many of the overly enthusiastic reviews are by bien pensant liberals tickled pink that imperator furiosa charlize therons character is such a bad ass and they love that her mission of redemption has her saving a group of young slave women kept as breeders by the chief baddie immortan joe played by hugh keaysbyrne who also played toecutter in the original mad max theron really is good in the movie and the breeders escape would make for a decent enough plot on its own but none of the characters including furiosa is developed enough to make us much care about them as anything but symbols more fatally for the movie as a whole this is true of max as well     director george miller seems to have acquired a severe case of attentiondeficit disorder over the last 30 years like all the rest of us the title might more rightly be mad max freak show as it moves to the center the bizarre and disorienting weirdness that occupied the periphery of the first two movies at the center of those movies was a max who was convincing as a sensitive family man thrillseeking gogetter cop and well mad man bent on revenge in the latest movie tom hardy plays a much more brutish max closer to what we saw in road warrior but without the narrative grounding he also sounds a little too much like bane at a couple points were just supposed to know this is max even though hes haunted by a young girl we dont know from the earlier movies of course hes haunted by her death and his failure to save herwhat else do you need to know right furiosa tells himjust tells himthat she too is after redemption presumably for serving immortan for as long as she has     conspicuously absent from this mad max movie is a revenge plot one of the escaped girls gets scared when the action really heats up and says she wants to return to the citadel run by joe one of the irradiated war boys pursuing them arbitrarily switches his allegiance and ends up sacrificing himself to protect the women with the exception of furiosa who wants to return to the green place she was kidnapped from as a child and joe who wants his breeders back no one has much motivation to speak of with characters this paper thin the action can only be spectacular not compelling i almost wished miller had realized his story was actually about the escaping womenhe could have saved the mad max reboot for another movie giving all the characters the space they deserved    even though the screenplay is a disaster with dialogue as disposable as the characters and nothing truly memorable to take away fury road really is spectacular as chaotic as the action sequences are theyre still coherent as sequences something many action films dont bother with anymore and though the freakishness doesnt belong as close to the center of focus as it is its still enjoyably unsettling and at times hilariously over the top ultimately its a great action flick to see on the big screen but i doubt any kids who see it today are going to be anywhere near as nostalgic for it in thirty years as boys from my generation were for the first two movies still as my best friend said after the credits started rolling it was a lot better than beyond thunderdome
May 16 2015,positive,amazing visuals sound and acting  not to be missed action packed post apocalyptic film made by the master of the genre
May 16 2015,negative,absolutely the worst movie i have ever seen  no plot the entire movie was like watching cave men in a constant state of road rage  i wish negative stars was an option
May 16 2015,negative,worst remake of a classic movie to date  dont waste your money on this
May 16 2015,positive,crazy  furious  angry and visually fantastic mad max fury road honour his predecessors
May 16 2015,negative,did i miss something here 0 depth to max who has 3 lines on the movie charlize is great but not enough to save it too much goodactually action but nothing to do w the old movie besides the cardesert scenes i wish they called it something else and maybe i wouldnt be so disappointed   funny fact the models are always perfectly clean please
May 16 2015,positive,one of the best if not the best movies ive ever seen and i pretty much watch them all
May 16 2015,positive,the spectacle of mad max fury road is a symphony of action under george milers direction its gleefully insane like some unholy union between the wacky races cartoon and an iron maiden album cover miller has described the film as one long chase sequence when you get right down to it thats pretty accurate plotwise its a race to there and back again but its colin gibsons production design john seales cinematography junkie xls immersive score and jenny beavans costumes that define this movie the look is absolutely bonkers its a testament to the visual and aural overload that it propels an adult like me into giddy exuberance mad max fury road is an all out pedal to the metal full throttle chase with nothing held back you know those preteens raised on heavy metal music and 80s action movies back in the day well were adults now  this movie hits the sweet spot    fastfilmreviewscom
May 16 2015,positive,this film is 2 hours of madness max rockatansky becomes involved in an escape in progress imerator furiosa has kidnapped a warlords imprisoned baby makers and trying to get them to safety they are fleeing across the apocalyptic wasteland with immortan joe and his cronies in hot pursuit   george miller has created a magnificent beast of a film the soundtrack the camera work the colours the stunts the action set pieces the characters all excellent this film needs to be seen on the big screen in my opinion tv would not do it justice experience it in the cinema and soak it in fucking insane
May 16 2015,positive,two hours full of overthetop action sequences a new term of comparison for action movies an outstanding charlize theron wow
May 16 2015,neutral,this movie was nonstop action and thats not good  from the moment the movie starts the director jams on the gas pedal  im assuming he wanted to provide a lot of action for a society with a short attention span  the only problem is that the pacing of the movie creates two problems  the first and most important problem is the lack of dialogue  this does not let any of the characters or storylines develop  the second casualty is the excitement itself  without any breaks in the action the action itself becomes less special  i guess an analogy would be if youre in a car and someone starts driving 100 mph  at first it would be scary and exciting but after a few minutes would become blase
May 16 2015,positive,this is the best movie i have ever seen
May 16 2015,positive,an nonstop adrenaline ride from start to finish great action and effects good story and acting just how a mad max film should be
May 16 2015,positive,george millers great postapocalyptic vision   top notch action sequences   tom hardycharlize theronnicholas hoult  
May 16 2015,positive,the mad max trilogy on steroids insanity in a seemingly endless chase amongst the mad the madder and the maddest
May 16 2015,positive,cool plot and action it was todo bien it kept you on the edge of the seat and feeling chased with action it kept my attention as if i felt being chasedthe only bad about the movie was that the culture theme was weird and quite disgusting with loonies and blood transfusions i watched a post apocolypitc tv shows and movies before like future boy conan and the hunger games series there was speculation that hunger games and mad max take place in the same universe niether future boy conan nor hunger games had the weird sick cultures and crazy loonies like this mad max movie did the movie was wild as in great movie but got a little too wild but its australia what do you expect another reason i was not surprised is that there was connections to a mel gibson movie i watched the first 1979 mad max movie and the passion of the christ
May 16 2015,positive,the best movie ive seen since the dark knight  nonstop mayhem that is a blast to watch  will it win an oscar  of course not and that is why it is a great movie
May 16 2015,positive,the movie displays tyranny versus freedom in a very eloquent way the powerful representatives of the current economic political and religious order in many parts of the world resonate with the character immortan joe true to its end credits the movie conveys its message with a bang it gives you something to think about on your bus ride or drive back home some of us look for hope rosie huntington character some of us know the truth and choose to survive max and some of them are pure believers whose faith when shaken turns them in to rebels with or without a cause hoult and theron in the end this movie was owned by several characters rather than just one central character called max an emotionally scarred spectator who is witnessing the world tear itself apart with events crunched in celluloid time and space george miller has to work on a sequel now because this one is going to need one and it should not be shelved liked karl urbans another cult classic dredd
May 16 2015,positive,100 badass action film
May 16 2015,positive,george millers amazing direction brings again the simplest and most effective to date idea of a postapocalyptic future to life with brief but highly effective moments tom hardys rendition of the crazy protagonist is outstanding and he is helped both by the equally brutal charlize theron and nicholas hoults surprising performance the script is simple but wisely written and full of excellent nonstop action moments the cinematography the makeup and the special effects bring colour realism and desolation in a elegant way junkie xls soundtrack is pure gold and the work by the stunt team is absolutely unmatchable all this makes mad max fury road one of the best action films ever released and will surely be remembered for years to come
May 16 2015,positive,thanks for posting all the insanely overhyped better than avengers reviews ya aholes it totally ruined my expectations for this
May 16 2015,positive,the visual effects are stunning and there are some very funny moments in this crazy film howeverthe  film is not without flaws as the editing is a bit annoying in places especially the over use of jump cuts which completely takes you out of the storythe plot is easy to follow but maybe they should have called the film there and back again
May 16 2015,positive,mad max mastermind george miller returns 30 years after the supposedly final film in the mm trilogy with the thunderous reboot fury road  an explosive testosterone pumped and fuelinjected nonstop action fest which has perhaps revived the much needed modern action genre all by itself fury road stars both tom hardy as max rockatansky and charlize theron as rogue warrior imperator furiosa in a very straightforward nofrills plot about a postapocalypse desert distant future where one supreme leader immortan joe played by original 1979 mad max toecutter villain actor hugh keaysbyrne seeks to recover his most precious top breeder brides who have been kidnapped for rescue by the antihero traitor furiosa hellbent on freeing the enslaved beautiful brides furiosa betrays her once obeyed leader who dominates control over the general living public by seemingly owning the entire worlds water supply furiosa dashes her way out of the area in a 2000 horsepower spiked and rusted weaponized grand semiwar machine of a vehicle which can also be seen as a main character in itself max being a prisoner of immortan joe is caught in the mix and eventually helps the rogue team to attempt escape  there is no denying it  fury road is a relentless barrage of car chase action sequences from start to finish and using about 80 practical effects for all of the explosive and super loud fun the 3d of which does give a nice touch to only a few scenes does bring a very real and gritty fullness to any moviegoers experience while breaking in only a couple of parts to advance the plot the film boasts in its three major action chase acts all bringing new fresh ideas to the table in a very gripping and intense if about 90 disappointingly bloodless and goreless joy ride a joy ride that in and of itself holds the vast majority of the viewers attention not feeling as if it even requires a more indepth look at character pasts and personalities which in the end does make the viewer desire just a little bit more     millers truest sequel to 1981s the road warrior fury road resembles the classic action cult film in far more regard than the other two in the franchise in both its human element of mentally insane and twisted characters and dystopia desert setting the art style and visual treat alone helm fury road to seeming intent on reserving itself to a more selective audience  namely those of the heavy metal90s industrial grunge crowd where constant screams odes to norse mythological beliefs and plenty of war painted psychotic soldiers in riot gear clearly inspired by artists like hr giger make fury road feel a lot like a mashing of 90s music videos by acts such as white zombie nine inch nails and ministry the visual ideas and cinematography feel more at the forefront here than characterization but it is also what makes fury road so unique and special in a modern day of pg13 action films created for middleschool children such a conclusion can easily be made by the films 80sstyle acting and dialogue which can be somewhat difficult to decipher and understand at times lines spoken resemble less of what humans sound like regularly speaking and more like poetry being read aloud which was millers writing style even way back when with the original films such artistic and theatrical dramatics will likely be most appreciated by more diehard action film buffs and established mad max franchise fans newcomers and even more casual fans may find themselves more dependent on the action alone to find fulfillment in their hardearned movie spending cash     despite what can be seen as flaws or oversights in characterization and a story that could have done more in the surprises or plot twists department there can also be an overwhelming feeling that fury road which doesnt truly star max as the number one leading frontman resembles at least to this reviewer rage the movie over a true mad max film rage being the postapocalypse video game released in 2011 this is likely caused to furiosa taking much of the lead role as well as the fact that max himself doesnt ever seem to say much leaving the viewer desiring much more out of the character     fans and general audiences will still in the end all be treated to an action film that is truly a shining loner in a sea of shakycam and teeny bopper copycats plaguing the film industry today with ideas and intense sequences that will offer a fresh breath of the highoctane adrenaline rush that fans of the genre have been clamoring about for years now millers intelligent use of editing wide panoramic camera angles and shots intense sound effects and protagonists who are in constant peril all equal a film that can at times be so intense it will literally exhaust the viewer which is a very good thing because it does mean we are definitely being gripped by the experience it is obvious that miller cares more about his aweinspiring explosive sequences and artistic visuals than anything else but not meaning that the other elements are useless mad max is definitely a huge treat which will absolutely be worth a purchase once released on bluray for an epically fun time with friends popcorn and a great sound system
May 16 2015,positive,the plot is simple get to point b from point a without getting killed and thats how mad max fury road gets the narrative going but dont be fooled by this apparent simplicity the visuals are highly realized the sound engagingly  impeccable performances are sublime and direction is succinct it delivers hugely on the gore but transfixes you totally and will never allow you to miss a single moment of its roughness and dont get me started on the amazingly handsome charlize theron she may have to give angie a run for her money watch this you will want to roll into a scorching sand dune afterwards it is ugliness in its most beautiful form five out of five stars
May 16 2015,positive,this is amazing far more better than i expected kudos and bravo to the crews
May 16 2015,positive,a beautifully crafted and visually stunning squeal to a cult favourite trilogy
May 16 2015,positive,wow what a fantastic film full of some amazing action and beautiful cinematography
May 16 2015,positive,an adrenaline rush from start to finish with a very progressive tone but oldschool feel
May 16 2015,positive,perhaps the best allout action movie since the heady days of arnolds 80s fury road is a rare highoctane summer movie with a strong female presence    the film always moves forwards in and atop wildlycustomised vehicles that double up as mobile sets on which the plot unfolds the action sequences are pervasive but organic to the story with each somehow oneupping the last one for spectacle    george millers lunatic vision has been finally given a budget to match and the result is something entirely unique you wont quite be able to pinpoint what it reminds you of because there is no precedent for fury road even among the original trilogy
May 16 2015,positive,highly inventive and unique perhaps one of the biggest sensory assaults of the year a strange one it is but i dont see any action film living up to this ambitious and wellexecuted spectacle
May 16 2015,positive,if you have ever woken up gratefully from one of those long oppressive nightmares where you are pursued by an intangible dread or an implacable foe with hopelessness despair ugliness oppression and fear all about you or wandered innocently onto some extreme rollercoaster ridecumhorror tunnel thinking it was the icecream store then you know how you will feel after these two noisy hours  still at least there are no pretensions towards justification for this extended chase which falls into two halves  first we run all the way there and then we run all the way back  an extremely phonylooking rock arch is demolished twice  once in one direction and then in another  and boy for people who live in deserts they really need a more efficient mass waterdistribution system  apparently films in namibia because australia hasnt got enough deserts of its own  theyve also apparently run out of mel gibson
May 16 2015,positive,amazing movie that doesnt disappoint
May 16 2015,positive,you know how car chases are the most exciting and actionpacked part of a movie with mad max its the entire movie and its on steroids
May 16 2015,positive,stunning breathtaking beautiful epic thunderous aweinspiring speechless now the current generation of moviegoers all know what the entire world felt like on may 261977 the day after star wars a new hope was released rotten tomatoes needs to add a sixth star choice to their rating system just for this movie this is a billion dollar movie forget best postapocalyptic movie forget best action movie this is simply the best movie ever made period i can now go to valhalla
May 16 2015,positive,non stop epic action  the only thing you can hate about this movie is only your nonsense opinion
May 16 2015,positive,holy crap this was totally awesome george miller is a cinematic genius
May 16 2015,positive,fury road has all the characteristics of a landmark action movie with excellent action sequences that are long but never tiresome and tom hardy and charlize theron dont disappoint
May 16 2015,positive,just plain awesome 1010
May 16 2015,negative,its official every critic in the country is paid off zero plot substance or character looks cool a few small innovative quirks in the world a 2 hour music video of explosions and people doing stuff you wont care stay home and watch old hair band music videos for the same effect these critics are insulting
May 16 2015,positive,this movie is action poetry just finished want to watch it again damn good flick
May 16 2015,positive,oh what a day what a lovely day a lovely day indeed
May 16 2015,positive,4 stars for amazing cinematography car chases fight scenes and charlize therons performance i love tom hardy but he didnt have much to work with for dialogue which i know is in the original story but i still love hearing him talk its a crazy wild ride and not like anything youve seen or will see
May 16 2015,positive,doesnt let up awesome designs gripping action sequences
May 16 2015,positive,visually captivating   incredible feet to pull of as a film  but lacks the the foundation story arc and dialog to make it a truly compelling work   ok you could get away with the lack of dialog  but the film becomes a frantic albeit stunning train of monotony  there is a lot to appreciate  the production value is jaw dropping  but alas in the end you are left with characters and a story that just doesnt live up to its visual counterpart  a rare occasion where i felt simultaneously overwhelmed and underwhelmed
May 16 2015,positive,movie review    mad max fury road 455    tales from the borderlands    rated r    2hrs 0mins    intense nonstop action  grand music that adds to the intensity of the action  unique style gives movie its own personal identity    max is only along for the ride    final decision see it
May 16 2015,positive,this movie turned out to be so much more than i expected  an intense actionpacked ride with a crazy cast of characters and a mad good story that draws you into the world of fire and blood  its one of the best summer movies and definitely a great film that not only is a worthy sequel to mad max but stands out on its own as a magnificent movie  avengers started the summer for movies mad max keeps it going and its going strong
May 16 2015,positive,i really wanted this to be good and it was non stop action edge of your seat stuff from 1 minute in until the credits
May 16 2015,positive,this film is awesome  jam packed action from start to finish  watched it 3d at imax was amazing
May 16 2015,positive,âïâïâïâïâï  5 stars awesome action flick about time  thank you
May 16 2015,positive,george miller returns with a mad max sequel 30 years later to show us how its done with unparalleled stunt and action sequences mad max fury road combines gritty 80s action unique set and costume design and well rounded characters for a rip roaring chase across post apocalyptic landscapes featuring an incredible performance from charlize theron mad max fury road is one of those distant sequels that was made with passion in mind not finance the result is one of the best films in years
May 16 2015,positive,mad max fury road was an adrenaline fueling ride the sets the costumes the make up the vehicles and the stunts good god the stunts the story is pretty simple but then again at least it doesnt have too many plots its straightforward and doesnt slow down at least in a pointless way i also like how it stays rated r just like its predecessors with films like alien vs predator where it wimps out by making it pg13 it felt good that the makers didnt take us for granted watch the movie youre bound to enjoy it just be mindful of some disturbing moments some may even make you puke
May 16 2015,positive,amazingly intense production  a must see
May 16 2015,negative,wow this movie is not good in fact the story is downright idiotic the action and special effects are its only saving grace talk about over rated dont waste your money see avengers again instead
May 16 2015,negative,im at a loss to explain what movie the rest of the world is seeing  halfway through this film i turned to my wife and said surely this is almost over then it proceeded to go all the way back to the beginning in reverse     not certain this can even be called a movie a movie has a theme a plot a story characterization  this has incredible car mashups that explode beautifully thats a sequence of scenes not a movie
May 16 2015,positive,most fun ive had in a long time it plays like a rob zombie music video cranked into overdrive
May 16 2015,positive,this is the greatest action film of 2015 probably one of the greatest of all time
May 16 2015,positive,non stop action with a decent storyline but the all star cast and rollercoaster action scenes keep the film franchise alive and well
May 16 2015,positive,i would have given it a 5 star but i didnt like the fact that mad max was a sidekick in his own movie  i was surprised that this movie turned out to be a feminist propaganda where the main hero is charlize theron might just have called the movie furiosa road with mad max
May 16 2015,positive,a quote from hot fuzz sums this movie up perfectly a no holds barred adrenaline fueled thrill ride its what a summer action movie should be almost 2 whole hours of car chase mayhem in the most creative and fun way
May 16 2015,positive,remember two weeks ago when the avengers was supposed to be the coolest thing ever well needless to say mad max fury road makes age of ultron look like bambi
May 16 2015,positive,non stop from start to finish tom hardy stays true to mad max and charlize theron is awesome as always
May 16 2015,positive,this movie is by far the best movie of the year i cant believe i just saw a movie like this so good that i dont even know what to say about this it was breath taking and with packs with lots of actions must watch this movie 
May 16 2015,positive,oh whatta daywhatta lovely day
May 16 2015,neutral,i gotta say this was just another action movie very good fighting scenes howeverthis was not mad max tom hardy spent the entire movie grunting there was no dialoguehe didnt even fight toe cutter they gave him this mask to make him look like bane and he was even talking like baneand there was this guy playing guitar all the timeit just doesnt fit the mad max sequelinteresting movie but left a lot to desire
May 16 2015,positive,you can almost taste the metal and gasoline but none of tom hardys performance charlize theron though
May 16 2015,positive,beyond incredible at every turn the first 30 minutes are breathtaking for the movie as a whole the attention to detail was astounding and mesmerizing it is also one of the strongest feminist movies ive seen in a very long time considering its science fiction and an action film that puts this in a rare place the style of the movie is nearly overwhelming at points especially in 3d but its worth it nonetheless feels startlingly original even though it is just riffing off the ideas the movie played with 30 years ago
May 16 2015,positive,a pure blast of unadulterated adrenalin pumping cinema the unrestrained chaos is both exhausting and inspiring watch this film now
May 16 2015,positive,energetic relentless and and spectacular in every sense itll keep you on the edge of your seat until the final frame is projected
May 16 2015,positive,30 years in the waiting millers return to the franchise and live action film making doesnt disappoint   imagine john fords stagecoach reimagined by william s burroughs jg ballard and heironymus bosch and you are some of the way there   miller expands on the aesthetic established in mad max 2 and beyond thunderdome with dazzling effect   the narrative is efficient to the point of paper thin but its a super charged kinetic action movie with real practical stunts and effects that is unlike any other tent pole release you will see and is head and shoulders above the rest
May 16 2015,positive,amazing movie enjoyed every minute of it improvement from the original
May 16 2015,negative,basically 2 hours of cars blowing up exercising their cgi skills and shoving a lot of action at the audience with no regard for a plot
May 16 2015,negative,to be a good movie you must write more than one story arc  if you are looking for lots of splodies with not much reason behind them this may be the perfect movie for your mouth breathin ass
May 16 2015,positive,it starts at 11 and cranks it up to 12
May 16 2015,positive,best movie i have seen since bridesmaids  said gay guy who hates action movies
May 16 2015,positive,intense very intense i enjoyed tom hardys portrayal of max and i give that guitarist a five star anytime anywhere
May 16 2015,positive,you better be ready to be blown away keeps you on the edge of your seat almost the whole movie great movie i need a xanax after that holy t
May 16 2015,positive,great action scenes but flimsy characters and story
May 16 2015,positive,a pulse pounding adrenaline rush that reminded me of the mega metal concerts of yesteryear  it is a movie in which every scene is more than what you can take in all at once  it pounds you flips you and then kicks you out onto the curb leaving you not quite sure what just happened but wanting more  the miracle isnt in the film but in the fact that a hollywood studio sent a 65 year old man into the namibia desert with a  150 million dollars to make the film of his dreams  this isnt romance and it isnt happy dreams  it simply is nonstop romp into the rate r realm of violence and action where the cig is sparse and the stunts are real  enjoy it for what it is because movies like this simply dont exist today
May 16 2015,positive,highly entertaining over the top action movie with a strong lead by charlize theron
May 16 2015,positive,this movie was 100 action excess and absolutely awe inspiring effects oh and also possible the most amazing representation of women in not only any action film ive seen but any film in general a 100 this movie deserves all the praise and more go see it now you wont regret it
May 16 2015,positive,theres a new barit swings from a car to another car to a war rig boooooooommmm the best
May 16 2015,positive,wow this is movie so good soooo crazy great action
May 15 2015,positive,do i even have to explain this one
May 15 2015,positive,this movie is almost nonstop action for two hours  if you liked the original mad max movies youll like fury road
May 15 2015,positive,fury road is like god of action movies its an unforgettable trip that wont stuck out of my head its like an awesome ride at an amusement park you want to get in again in again a masterpiece
May 15 2015,positive,my only regret is i have only five stars to give  valhalla awaits this film
May 15 2015,positive,this director kicks ass at age 70 and this movie will make you say wow on multiple occasions satisfaction guaranteed a movie like that comes every 20 years directing 5 stars  editing 5 stars  adrenaline 5 stars u will want to see it twice had the chance to experience it again in 4d which is amazing 2d does the job too
May 15 2015,positive,best movie i have seen it was so different  amazing
May 15 2015,positive,mad max is epic  one hell of a thrill ride a must watch masterpiece
May 15 2015,positive,love the cirquewagon  double guitar from ka  drums from mystere  an insane thrill ride  nice to have max back
May 15 2015,positive,oh what a movie what a lovely movie        really though i enjoyed it thoroughly visually stunning a set direction in it all would see again
May 15 2015,negative,one of the worst movies ive ever seen the rating it got here is completely ridiculous almost as if this page has been spammed by people hired by the studio to upvote a terrible movie so unsuspecting people go pay to see it i trust rotten tomatoes way less now having seen this rating and then going to see a movie that was a complete waste of time
May 15 2015,positive,it was intense from start to finish  i love it
May 15 2015,positive,just watched it amazing
May 15 2015,neutral,the movie is along chase scene very little dialog or story telling its obvious the goal for the characters but not quite clear what the villain is up too the climax was quick to the punch and i wasnt satisfied with the end maybe this was supposed to be a cliffhanger for part two but im not feeling the need for a sequel
May 15 2015,positive,the new mad max movie is not just good but its stupefyingly amazing   the trailer made it look interesting but somewhat ridiculous electric guitar dude sums that assumption up in three words but the movie somehow manages to succeed in every way that most remakes or new ideas fail  you wonder how many interesting action scenarios can possibly happen in a barren desert wasteland  the answer to that question is bordering on overkill with nonstop heart pounding vehicular action scenes  its like fast  furious 7 with postapocalyptic warfare  the characteristics of the cast is similar to a star wars movie  evil dictator in a mask and his army of emaciated skin heads chasing after a renegade female officer who stole his four pretty wives  mad max is a prisoner who is taken along for the ride  i hated his character  he just grunts for half the movie and shows absolutely no interest in joining forces with a mercenary cargo truck of supermodels   mad maxs homosexual attitude and annoying delusions were destined to make this a bad movie but i still rank this half a star away from perfect  disregarded imperfections
May 15 2015,negative,feminist movie of the year dont make me laugh women ridiculed this film in the halls and bathrooms during and afterwards men coming out at the end didnt like it either  wow what a shtty movie was the irl review from both sexes leaving the theater
May 15 2015,positive,this movie is really good strong plot actionpacked theres never a boring scene in the entire movie its one of the best movies of 2015 i highly recommend it
May 15 2015,positive,i was one of the many that has never seen a mad max film so i wasnt expecting much i was blown away in that regard max max is insanity on the silver screen chaotic when there is action going on and surprisingly quiet and peaceful in lulls the pacing is excellent    tom hardy plays max a man of little words but many actions he was captured by imperator joe and his war boys and enslaved to them forced to give his blood to keep the sick war boys alive and make them stronger    while hardy is the leading name i feel that the two best performances were actually by charlize theron as the fierce imperator furiosa and nicholas hoult as nux the endearingly reverent war boy despite the performances millers vision is by far what makes the film a rousing success    mad max is whiteknuckle excitement at its highest octane and i would be hard pressed to deny that i had so much fun watching it
May 15 2015,negative,good special effects but it just felt like one long car chase really dont understand the 97 rating i was just really bored through the whole movie
May 15 2015,positive,55 would watch pale warriors charge into battle with flamethrower guitar solos to kill mad max to gain entry into valhalla again
May 15 2015,positive,about as perfect as an action movie can be rough edges and all  if only all creators of legendary franchises treated their material with such meticulous care and respect
May 15 2015,negative,stupid premise pretty models that are horrible actresses lots of action but not worth your money
May 15 2015,positive,this movie was phenomenal was blown away by the story the action scenes everything was just perfect
May 15 2015,positive,like nothing ive ever seen before simply incredible
May 15 2015,negative,i am not sure which is worse the civilization portrayed or the one that likes it this collection of imagery that i would not dignify by calling a movie is a complete vacuum of story  i do not mind a light story but this is too empty if this is any sign of the future releases from hollywood then i will just stop watching movies altogether
May 15 2015,positive,very good very strange prepare for a mental fucking of mass proportions
May 15 2015,positive,with the simplest plot the action is in high octane level from the get go till the end must be the best postapocalyptic movie i have ever seen and must i quote  oh what a lovely day
May 15 2015,positive,even better than the hype lead me to believe it was a thrill ride that only got crazier as it went on
May 15 2015,positive,best action movie since the dark knight rises
May 15 2015,negative,douchiest douche that ever douched
May 15 2015,negative,mad max defends a milk truck from a metal band you can skip this one
May 15 2015,positive,one of the best action movies ever
May 15 2015,positive,mad max fury road contains all the firstrate pedal to the metal adrenalinepumping action a fan could ever ask for while also providing us with two strong performances from tom hardy and charlize theron both of whom reign in the madness by injecting enough heart into their lead characters despite it being three decades since the last mad max feature franchise creator george miller proves he hasnt lost a single step in all that time bringing us the best pure action film of this decade    full review at 
May 15 2015,negative,i should have let my husband see this one solo i get why dudes want to see it though there are supedup automobiles massive explosions and hot chicks to boot but i could have gotten all that from any fast and furious movie tom hardy i award 5 stars he is fucking amazing charlize theron did well too but shes so talented i honestly just expect greatness from her in any role
May 15 2015,positive,as the world fell it was hard to know who was more crazy me or everyone else    to describe george millers fourth postapocalyptic mad max film as crazy would be an understatement because it is one of those rare over the top and unique action films that keeps you at the edge of your seat during its entire runtime with fantastic car chases and inventive fighting scenes that feel like a breath of fresh air in an era dominated by cgi effects the visuals absolutely stun you and millers amazing vision of this apocalyptic wasteland is beautifully captured through the camera it may have taken 30 years for this sequel to be released but it is a huge improvement over beyond thunderdome and it manages to build on what the road warrior had achieved by introducing a much more chaotic world and colorful characters fury road works both ways as either a sequel or a reboot and it erases most of the problems i had with maxs character in the previous film this is a return to what miller had done in the road warrior but with a much higher budget to work with and that allowed his vision to be fully fulfilled here three more mad max films are already in the talks and i cant wait to embark with max on his next adventures this is going to be a very difficult film to top and so far its the best 2015 has to offer    in fury road tom hardy replaces mel gibson for the lead role of max a wondering warrior whos still coping with the loss of his wife and son as he travels through the postapocalyptic deserted wasteland the film begins with a group of bandits chasing max who eventually capture him and take him to the citadel where a ruthless leader named immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne controls the water supply for the masses that have gathered below the heights of the mountain where he is based joe doesnt just control the water supply he also has a large army of war boys who he has trained to sacrifice themselves willingly for his service farming women who breed their breast milk and even several beautiful wives to give him children joe has created quite an empire and max has been enslaved to serve as a blood donor for the injured war boys we are introduced to this crazy place and its rules as joe sends his trusted lieutenant imperator furiosa charlize theron on a local errand with her fuel filled rig to gasland however she  decides to take another route and her intentions are soon revealed she is helping some of joes wives escape from their enslavement promising to lead them to the green lands when joe discovers that she has betrayed him he sends all his boys out on a desperate chase and that includes nux nicholas hoult one of the war boys who is using max as his personal blood bag nux chains max to the front of his vehicle and brings him along the desperate and nonstop chase that ensues for the next two hours fury road is basically one extensive chase that will get the entire audiences blood pumping      ive praised millers vision and his direction as well as the spectacular action set pieces he has crafted but it wouldnt do this film justice if the cast didnt receive its share of praise as well it isnt easy to fill the shoes of such an iconic character like mad max but tom hardy pulled it off in a very convincing matter as much as i like mel gibson i have to give hardy a lot of praise for delivering such an entertaining performance he is one of my favorite actors working today it was also great to see hugh keaysbyrne back in a mad max film playing a different character this time but he absolutely nailed the menacing role of joe nicholas hoult was also a pleasant surprise but perhaps the greatest addition to this franchise was charlize therons furiosa who injects the film with a very much needed feminist tone theron delivers perhaps the strongest and most memorable role in the movie and she is one kickass action star it helped that she got a lot of action scenes where she actually got to do something instead of being the damsel in distress the look of the film is also breathtaking and the way that miller envisions this world is simply fantastic the cool vehicles are built from all sorts of scrappy metals and materials youd collect in the wasteland everything about this film is simply fantastic and the action scenes dont disappoint one bit you will feel the rush from the very opening scene and it will continue long after the credits begin to roll fury road is the best film of the franchise

May 15 2015,positive,they dont make movies like this anymore
May 15 2015,positive,simply unbelievable a masterpiece
May 15 2015,positive,if youre looking for some emotional journey look elsewhere  if you need an adrenaline kick with enough action to make your head spin look no further

May 15 2015,positive,dark twisted and nonstop actionloved it

May 15 2015,positive,the shots were beautiful the cinematography was magnificent the plot and pacing was perfect i truly cared about the characters this is how action movies are meant to be
May 15 2015,positive,unique in its own way mad max fury road prices good movies can still be made with an action heart you dont want to miss this
May 15 2015,negative,seriously was extremely excited to go see based on great review ratings the people next to me got up and left 30 minutes ini should of followed them
May 15 2015,positive,people tend to overhype everything especially movies but this is one of the few that delivers from the very first minute this movie knows exactly what its doing it wants to create a ballstothewall action film with an insane world populated by exaggerated people and it works wonderfully     the entire movie is just one massive car chase in the desert and it never lets go of you
May 15 2015,positive,i was not to sure about a new version of mad max well let me tell you the story is good some parts are corny but you cant stop watching we even forgot it was two hours long
May 15 2015,positive,absolute masterpiece cinematographymusic actors
May 15 2015,positive,pretty sure we just walked out of the most gripping action flick ever filmed also felt like walking out of an awesome rock concert absolutely amazing graphics perfect casting will see it many more times
May 15 2015,positive,top 5 movie of all time i wish i would have watched it in xd or imax worth watching twice
May 15 2015,positive,excellent action all around definitely an impressive throw back to the 80s film series the soundtrack really captivates you into the moments of thrill however this film shortcoming lies with writing that just feels forced for every scene of excitement came with a drag of plot that was meant for the audience to connect with the characters overall i left the theatre rather disappointed at something that could have been a lot better case in point the movie was mehhh perhaps die hard fans of the original will appreciate it more than i do but i wont recommend watching this movie at full price just go on a tuesday
May 15 2015,positive,adrenaline orgasm enough said
May 15 2015,positive,incredible movie  im mostly amazed that such a gritty postapocalyptic movie can be so perfectly beautiful
May 15 2015,positive,amazing original for a remake loved everything about it
May 15 2015,negative,fans of the franchise will be disappointed they destroyed mad max nothing makes sense here the plot is something written by 6th graders i was a huge fan of the originals even thunderdome but this a movie made for short clips for the trailer  something is wrong with all these critics because the reviews do not match the movie  so awful you will laugh about scenes in this movie
May 15 2015,positive,there were explosions n shit
May 15 2015,positive,well i guess i was disappointed no gore maxs character was awfull plot made no sense and no gore in this movie great sound track stunts and cgi it will make a great video game
May 15 2015,positive,so i have a new favourite movieand it is most definitely mad max fury road    im a big apocalyptic movie fan and am usually very picky about them and if a movie is good i will simply be satisfied with it and leave it at that however this movie is way beyond that i am simply amazed at the masterpiece that is mad max fury road    when i first saw the trailer i gotta say i was quite excited it looked like a relatively enjoyable post apocalyptic movie and it had tom hardy in it which was great no complaints there in no way was i prepared for it though every scene was action packed exploding chaos and to sum it up it was pure brilliance and the strong female characters portrayed in it are wonderful and its very refreshing to see that in an action movie    i recommend it to everyone even if action movies post apocalyptic movies thriller movies arent your thing i still recommend it im going to have to go see it at the very least 5 more times    if i could give it a higher rating then i would but unfortunately i cant so 5 stars
May 15 2015,positive,a true masterpiece in all technical aspects i mean george miller truly is on the action movie olympus after this one the world he built back in the 80s has never felt so vivid an real the art direction the character designs everything has a personality that only a true visionary can accomplish miller practically does the opposite of george lucas having the technology and the resources he expands his world making the dangers of the wasteland and the desolation feel palpable never making it too convoluted the action sequences are just breathtaking and knowing that almost all of it is practical just gives it a whole new dimension the characters are developed in a way that is compelling but doesnt give too much away miller doesnt tell you about them or their world he shows you the only real problem might be that theres a little bit that drags before the final act but  keeping that frenetic pace for the whole two hours probably was impossible   nods to the fans welcoming to new audiences and having something for anyone who likes action cinema fury road really sets a really high standard for action blockbusters  someone said this was just a b movie given a ton of money and i agree on that and it turned out in the best possible way
May 15 2015,positive,gritty postapocalyptic ultraviolenceloved every minute of it alsoshredmobile that alone won me over
May 15 2015,negative,this movie is nothing more than pure action and zero story
May 15 2015,positive,josh helman is one scary babe
May 15 2015,positive,a complete cinematic experience  millers creation allow you become immersed in a desolate wasteland that is surprisingly teeming with color
May 15 2015,positive,possibly the visual effects masterpiece of the decade go witness it
May 15 2015,positive,what a lovely movie i had never seen a mad max movie before this one and honestly i dont think its necessary each mad max movie pretty much stands on its own including this one even more with this one since mel gibson didnt return and this movie has a very different style to it than the others as well this movie is very simple in the story department but the main draw of the film is the extreme practically non stop action and just crazy world george miller did a great job focusing on practical effects over cg and it shows in some ridiculously awesome action the soundtrack is also amazing perfectly putting the action into a musical form even serving as the sound effect track for a good portion of the movie the movie is just really exciting adrenaline pumping craziness its definitely a weird universe though which i could see turning some people away and it can also take a while to figure out just exactly whats going on with the world as well and what story is there is pretty thin but the main focus of the movie is on the action world building visuals and the soundtrack and in those areas i can think of very few films that do as well as fury road did    personal grade s  technical score 82
May 15 2015,positive,100 mind blowing action masterpiece this is an awesome hardcore film with a beautiful kick ass frame every single moment
May 15 2015,positive,the wildest two hours ive ever spent sitting in a chair
May 15 2015,positive,one big chase movie youll forget what the main focus of the it is at times but fear not because the extreme amount of chaotic action leads to some exhilarating thrills and great mindless entertainment
May 15 2015,positive,i never thought there would or could be another film as good as mad max 2  i was so wrong
May 15 2015,positive,incredibly great movie  puts previous mad max movies to shame friggin awesome
May 15 2015,positive,as technology continues to improve and digital effects persist its refreshing to see an oldschool master get back to basics  mad max fury road is a relentless marvel of sensepummeling stunts and gargoyle horror
May 15 2015,negative,if insanity and chaos is what you are looking for with an intense steam punk atmosphere then this movie is for you for me this movie gave me an unsettling and deep disgusted vibe deep in the pit of my bodysoul
May 15 2015,positive,the most important action flicksummer blockbuster to come out this century in one hundred years people look back at film history and note this film as the biggest turning point for sociocultural depictions of women and men depicted in mainstream films imagine that men and women working together as equals to win together this sounds to me like everyday life but im lucky to be able to say that
May 15 2015,positive,captivating cinematography and stunning visuals with great characters highlight this action epic tom hardy beats out mel gibson with a great performance george miller is a true genius 5 out of 5 stars
May 15 2015,positive,amazing movie cant wait for the sequal
May 15 2015,positive,lots of fun  spectacular soundtrack by junkie xl  cant wait to hear is batman theme next march  not a single cgi evil robot in sight  i highly recommend this film if youre suffering from comic book superhero green screen fatigue   nice pacing  i love the stunt work and production design  the story is a little light and bythenumbers but the eye candy and sound design is great
May 15 2015,positive,a visually dazzling odd action packed and well acted film roars to life and will exceed all expectations as it did mine
May 15 2015,positive,excellent writing great acting a wacky and playful tone amazing visuals for what this film is an actionadventure postapocalypse carchase film mad max is perfect
May 15 2015,positive,exhilarating  breathtaking   mad max is one of the most entertaining action movie ive seen in a while  granted that i have never seen the originals  so i couldnt tell you how it compares  id like to say that fury road did an outstanding job   from the cinematography to the score and such a great cast magnificent    this is definitely the movie of the year
May 15 2015,negative,the worst movie i have ever seen by far  this was worse than even m night shyamalans the village  two hours of fighting in the desert with no plot  hokey and campy  the guitar playing monster trucks during a somber death scene did it in for me
May 15 2015,positive,everything i hoped it would be legendary tom ruled and charlize kicked all kinds of ass
May 15 2015,positive,just finished watching mad max fury road and it is madness  it was brutal primal dirty grotesque animalistic roaring in your face until your senses are numb madness  and its beautiful  i havent seen anything like it and i love it  its refreshing in a way  its been a while since ive seen a movie create what feels like a tangible world and this one definitely has  once youre in it transports you into this apocalyptic world that has no ties to the world you know  you are in this universe of madness and it doesnt let go  i tell you one thing the most hardcore metal rock album cover art aint got nothing on fury road  that or whoever made those album cover paintings would be so proud to see this movie  watch this movie
May 15 2015,positive,30 years on and it seems as if george miller hasnt lost his touch the actions ferocious the acting topnotch and surprisingly heartfelt in a way that keeps this crazy world grounded i cant recommend this enough
May 15 2015,negative,worst movie ever guy flick so bad we laughed at it then feel asleep
May 15 2015,positive,the most beautiful movie ive seen in a very long time
May 15 2015,positive,whats impressive about this film is quantity and quality of the action exposed like a fresh wound throughout its entire length the creativity from a 70 year director whose old school camera   trickery has put modern actiondrama films into shame the physicality of the main characters and lets not even leave the stunts out just exquisite effort overall a very intense film that may have have you biting your nails with a possible pounding heart just have a cocktail before the movie     you just may need it
May 15 2015,positive,by far the best action movie i have ever seen proves that including strong yet realistic female roles does not compromise  story or action
May 15 2015,positive,honestly one of the best action movies ive seen in a long time it kept me interested throughout the cars and stunts were amazing beautiful set design too
May 15 2015,positive,i loved this movie  it is everything that movie have forgotten about  the action is amazing the costumes were epic  the post apocalyptic theme is awesome the old school cat and mouse chase never fails  this movie never had a dull moment  this movie is getting my top rating because this type of movie making is not done anymore when it was over i wanted to see more
May 15 2015,negative,great action weird and creepy story charlize is a bad ass
May 15 2015,positive,probably the best action film ive ever seen and a great post apocalyptic film too  tom hardy replacing mel gibson was good in the role  charlize theron was great too  i dont want to give too much away  yes it does a feminist bent to it but it works  so if you like this kind of stuff see it
May 15 2015,positive,gave me a testosterone rush reminiscent of my wasted teenage youth and i enjoyed every guilty minute of it
May 15 2015,positive,not with mel gibson a positive 10 dialog 90 action and unintelligible screaming rated r for good reason but and i hesitate to say this less i be misunderstood for just another bloody action movie viewer in search of mindless plot excessive and poorly done cgi explosions sex body counts dialog character development sex atrocious directingcinematography macho men macho machines macho macho macho in extremis this is something new and differentthis is like when i was 5 years old and saw the wizard of oz when the screen changed from black and white to color my heart did several flip flops i couldnt breathe and started to cry for joy up until that time i had dreamt in black and white as that was the tv that we had and the movies that we were allowed to see from that moment forward i have dreamed in color i also have afib now a result i am sure from that episode the chariot race in ben hur spartacus in the coliseum the vikings when the guy got shot through the eye the greatest story ever told when moses parted the red sea raiders of the lost ark the giant cave marble original star wars trilogy 2001 a space odyssey alien i the terminator etc you get my point each of those movies for me were milestones of a sort mad max has leapt over any existing milestone and has set an entirely new bar for its genre creating originality in script production direction cinematography cgi effects audio  and 3d subtleties abound layered nuances nuanced surprises nuanced nuances think of breaking bad in all of its bold originality and pure portrayals dial down the dialog plug in some very applicable shredded metal guitar as constant music background add 50 fentanyl patches an adderall factory a constantly evolving action that seemingly trains your eyes and mind from simplicity to complex sensory chaos that works and 3d that actually becomes a positive partner of the movie not just the movie or let me show you what all we paid for when i go to a movie my critical self is always my companion cant help it but from the beginning to end i keep a running checklist of what works what doesnt casting shot position point of view and a thousand other things of course these are all my opinions and are not necessarily validated in awards or box office but i dont care about that because i go to be entertained but it has to make a certain sense to me my rules cant be overunder done laws of physics in play better than half the time layers sub plots sustained development degree of nuances preforpost shadowing layering consolidating flattening real characters aligned with the human condition etc then syphoning all the before into the small funnel of conclusion after the movie works from beginning to end all of it in each scene the entire screen is part of the movie there are things going on that arent explained or dumbed down to the audience if you get it thats an extra and there are a ton of extras the tempo is comparable to a book you are compelled to not only read in one sitting but afterward treating your blistered fingers from frantic page turning mad max is also extraordinarily true to its series one cannot but notice the similarities and actual reappearance of the chronology characters specific scenes and flavors from its predecessors the original mad max looked like a 25 stars altpunk oneoff then came road warrior better writing production a sequel much better than the original at 3 stars aging well to 35 stars and cult status thunderdome was ok but trite clichéd and kind of boring in parts tina had better gigs but 25 stars at the time and still 25 stars this new piece of the tetralogy mad maxthe fury is about a 49 out of 5 or 93 out of 10 more if youre an action movie junkie if you loved the movie taken dont see this you definitely wouldnt understand it and basically wouldnt be able to keep up mad max is one of the best and most complete movie productions ive experienced i did not expect it but it earned my attention then began turning up the dial creating multiple attentions we were sitting in the second aisle middle probably 30 people total at 440 matinee easy access to the bathroom 20 out the door a mere 90 second sprint if the bladder wanted its way the movie is roughly 2 hours long i had to take a leak after the first hour even though i had taken a wellplanned excursion into the gentlemens prior to the beginning let me tell you the bladder tried everything in its power that had worked before to force me into running towards a toilet  but i did not yield one hour stalling the brainbladder connection and i was able to pay attention to my critical amazement and enjoyment rennie
May 15 2015,positive,one word wow this was such a thrill ride non stop action throughout from beginning to end interesting characters and a fantastic story that develops the characters amazing effects that are just jaw dropping and unbelievable the performances are also fantastic and the direction by george miller is just hands down brilliant worth my money worth my time excellent film best action film of the year for sure

May 15 2015,positive,the postapocalyptic film can be hit or miss but mad max fury road has some of the best action and chase scenes put on film in the 21st century  tom hardy is a breakthrough action star to go along with his recent success as a dramatic actor  hes going to win an oscar at some point  george miller writes and directs this film as well as anyone even at 70  i love it when women overshadow men in the action scenes

May 15 2015,positive,i was skeptical of this film living up to the hype but fury road exceeds it tenfold right from the beginning you are thrust into a one of a kind universe and punched in the face with high octane action the cinematography is breathtaking the performances of the actors are captivating and it is one hell of a ride throughout this film sets the bar to a whole other level and is indeed a milestone in the action genre
May 15 2015,positive,so this was pretty faithful to the other mad max movies i believe the same director who directed the original 3 also directed this dude invented an entire world with entire cultures and peoples if just regulated to a small bit of land lots of crazy action as you should expect from a mad max film good stuff

May 15 2015,positive,perhaps the finest visually stunning apocalyptic action film to datethat is not a recommendation to run out and see it apocalyptic action films are an acquired taste
May 15 2015,positive,this will be awesome
May 15 2015,negative,to me it was like 300garbagethe story was weakso was the actingit was weird and just wrongnot even a free downloadi want those 2 hours backlol
May 15 2015,positive,not terribly impressed   good action but the plot especially the final decision towards the end was horrible  a more expensive version of max mad 2
May 15 2015,positive,best action film of the 2000s
May 15 2015,positive,okay first review on here but hear me out some people are bashing this movie for no plot or character development and while its no shawshank redemption or godfather it is still an amazing movie and yes those people are wrong and chose not to pay attention because they probably dont like action films to begin with max undergoes huge development in the movie not to give anything away but in short he goes from a single instinct survive to someone willing to risk it all to protect others flashbacks that reference the originals influence his decision to help instead of fending for himself  uh hello that is textbook character development as far as plot this movie isnt an origin story so dont expect a nice neat opening go watch the originals for that but yes this movies plot is present its a story of survival desperation and yes even heart to be able to get 98 on rotten tomatoes should say it all best rated action movie of all time and is even top ten of all time here on rotten tomatoes this is a milestone action movie next to the matrix diehard terminator 2 aliens the road warrior indian jones star wars etc some people just rate movies and put them into one category you have to place them in their respective categories george miller want aiming for a slow burn drama he was aiming for an adrenaline filled thrill ride and by god he did it dont listen to the bad reviews or even the good reviews for that matter go watch the movie for yourself and you will see how this movie ranks among the greatest action flicks
May 15 2015,positive,wow after seeing it the first time i took a big sigh of relief because it was finally over 2 hours of relentless suspense and action intense great performances crazy action all as anticipated miller went right back to mm2the road warrior as he said he would i wish mel gibson would have made a cameo didnt see him in there several questions linger but the franchise has another hit in its story line for sure but what about the interceptor how does imortian joe rise to power where did furiosas arm go whats next for max
May 15 2015,negative,i thought it was lousy compared to the others
May 15 2015,positive,george millerâs mad max fury road released within me a whole variety of polarized emotions and feelings in its twohour running time in the first hour of the film i was extremely confused questioning the very existence of the film but still beholding and allowing myself to be stunned by its immense cinematic beauty which is encompassed by the overstylized gorgeous and unprecedented cinematography meticulous fastpaced editing dazzling visual effects and its complex and symbolic production design however i was struggling to actually understand what was going on to be completely honest i was hating the movie at the beginning feelings of intense stress and confusion arose and a huge migraine knocked on my skullâs surface i seriously have never been so grateful for the existence of silence those beautiful silent aerial shots when we were overlooking an explosion saved my brain from exploding i was thinking âwhat the actual fuck is thisâ i am going to start dramatizing now mad max is probably the loudest film i have ever experienced and this can be a real pain in the ass for people with sensory overload i missed some parts of the dialogue because it felt like my ears were taken from me oh yeah i was not enjoying it technical aspects aside of course    then the film started unraveling its quite simple storyline amidst an extremely convoluted world and things started making some sense mad max is some sort of new generation road movie set in an apocalyptic male chauvinist society that is run by people who control water gasoline and women see anything familiar it probably resembles most governments in the world yeah i think it does in this world women are just used for reproduction preferably baby boys please but furiosa the exquisite charlize theron max ptsd speechless tom hardy and other women instigate a smallscale uprising and set out to find a place that feels like home a place that would embody the very foundations of hope the use of the heroine in this film who is unquestionably furiosa mixed with the ideology of overthrowing male power and boosting up womenâs strength makes mad max a trailblazer in feminist filmmaking not only because of the filmâs apocalyptic nature but also because of its genre how often do we get to see this happen    however i do think there were some problems with the film one of them is that mad max is way way way too over the top it is probably extravagance multiplied by some good millions and it is my opinion that its style is extremely overpowering to the extent that it reaches a level where you debate whether it is a good thing or not especially in the first act of the film donât get me wrong i love how it looks but the overstylization causes dizziness which in the end might blind the audience of either noticing important symbols or understand whatâs happening whether this was on purpose or not it is irrelevant iâm certain it was on purpose and i donât necessarily agree with this decision moreover it takes a little bit too much to unravel its plot but i canât complain about that since the movieâs subtitle addresses the fact that it is a road a road that the audience has to ride and i guess they cannot skip parts of the ride to explain what was going on    nonetheless everything paid off in the end in mad max we have a film that can transcend the screen by having people talk about it in the way they are now but also itâs a film that does not forget its genre and that is something i really cherish one of the things that i liked the most about mad max is that it is an action film with a multilayered symbolic world and it is not just an action piece that wants to boasts its visual effects and its car crashes letâs face it this genre tends to fall into a shallow pit of violence most of the time but mad max rises above all of this and it still makes some space for some âcoolâ stuff which is probably what most people like about it not judging not judging iâm not watching this again in a long time because i donât want my body to physically go through it again but i really recommend it now you can understand why my opinions are polarized since i am still processing the film although do take into consideration that i am not a fan of action movies and i am not used to this but action buffs will surely love it but please bring some advils and do your brain a favor because itâs one hell of a ride literally
May 15 2015,positive,great characters fantastic chase sequences and a great story mad max makes a triumphant return after a 30 year hiatus
May 15 2015,negative,who rated this movie 5 is either brain dead or a preschool drop out  this could be the worst movie ever  i guess i did not drink or smoke enough prior to the movie
May 15 2015,positive,this is handsdown the most visually stunning film that ive ever seen avatar had set the bar on what could be achieved on screen this is another milestone a game changer mad max fury road was incredible
May 15 2015,positive,mad max fury road showered my brain in guzzoline lit it on fire then left it out in the wasteland to wander aimlessly then it came back to take a nice long steamy piss on me then stuffed a bag of cocaine in my mouth and forced me to chew       fury road stands next to the originals in a different way while some might not like the story i found the plot to be great for a movie about a single car chase   tom hardys plays a much more mad max with hallucinations and the occasional voices coming from nowhere i enjoyed tom hardys max just as much as mels and im glad that he didnt try to mimic mels max as he created his own max that fit him perfectly charlize therons imperator furiosa matches up with max in almost every single way fighting marksmanship and like max she is a hollow shell of herself determined to get immortan joes wives or breeders across the desert to her childhood home furiosa is tested in many ways although staying strong throughout the dangerous journey making her one of the strongest female characters in recent years     consensus fury road has some of the strongest action sequences in recent years while character development was not as good as expected if you do your research the backstories are great story was great for the circumstances fury road is permanently engraved in my mind and has raised the bar cinematically in alot of ways
May 15 2015,negative,an utter waste of time and money
May 15 2015,neutral,the valhalla nonsense wasnonsense could have been so much better
May 15 2015,positive,awesome movie really liked it it was the best action movie i have seen so far
May 15 2015,positive,a highoctane pulsepounding and worthy entry in the mad max saga director george miller breathes new life into a franchise that hasnt seen a new installment in over three decades and proves that there are more stories to tell about the titular loner the stunts are fantastic the visuals are breathtaking and it slows down just enough for you to catch your breath and move the story along tom hardy graciously takes over the role once played by mel gibson and rightfully earns the part at the same time charlize theron delivers an excellent performance as furiosa playing a character that seems to compliment max making it just as much her movie as it is the titular heros it can be said with confidence that the franchise is in good hands
May 15 2015,positive,intense but the flame throwing guitar was over the top
May 15 2015,positive,exceeded all expectations
May 15 2015,positive,entertaining and bad ass hollywood doesnt make movies like this anymore
May 15 2015,negative,the only reason anyone should watch this is if the entire world depends on it
May 15 2015,positive,coming right out of work on a friday i had no intentions of going to watch a movie that was never on my anticipation radarespecially before i see avengers age of ultronbut a coworker friend convinced me to go with him ladies and gentlemen mad max fury road is one for the ages the film is basically one giant chase sequencebut it and i highly doubt im overstating this is very likely to be the greatest chase sequence ever put on film how they managed to not have any stuntman extra or actor killed in the making this movie is a miracle in and of itself but what george miller and his team have crafted is nothing short of an exhilarating utterly insane they dont call it mad max for no reason emotionally gripping bloody artistic masterpiece despite the vast wastelands every frame of the film is littered with stunning detail every shot perfectly framed every performance on point and every action sequence an unforgettable sweatypalmed experience you wont forget and that musical score the hairs in my arms would stand each time it would kick up  amazing the editing is flawless the pacing immaculate for the longest time ive wanted to see an adaptation of the videogame twisted metal but feared it would be near impossible to be done right mad max fury road is that dream come to fruition its everything i love in action films and moreso much more run to your theater and support this film with the oversaturation of generic action films weve had for the last decade mad max fury road is telling alllll them suckas in hollywood how its done and we should back it with our wallets 1010
May 15 2015,positive,6262016 loved this movie tons of action  easily the best mad max yet may be the most action packed film i have ever seen an appearance by gibson would have been pretty cool too bad that didnt happen hopefully more films will follow
May 15 2015,positive,a eye popping thrill ride you want to see again and again
May 15 2015,positive,wasnt sure if i was going to see this movie or wait for it on dvd and omg amazing movie i will definitely see it again
May 15 2015,positive,definitely the most beautifully orchestrated blockbuster of all time
May 15 2015,positive,the best action movie i have ever seen absolutely amazing
May 15 2015,negative,pretty bummed was really looking forward to this one although the action scenes were incredible even more so for the fact that most are practical stunts and not cgi heavy there really wasnt much of a story and even less dialogue  needed more script time in prep instead of just action scenes
May 15 2015,positive,this is by far the best action movie of the decade and if you love action movie you will adore this it is insane with explosions and although it doesnt relate to 1 2 or 3 it is still one of the best action movies of all time i loved this movie and rate it 55
May 15 2015,positive,absolutely incredible was on the edge of my seat the entire time  a
May 15 2015,positive,a awesome summer movie worth checking out its got amazing action a good performance from tom hardy but charlize theron steals the show one of the best movies of the year so far 2015 is shaping out to be a amazing year
May 15 2015,negative,bang pow acrobatics explosion lame dialogue cheasy musical attempt to illicit emotion repeat
May 15 2015,positive,a visually beautiful movie but hardly a mad max movie     i know that starts off as a major disagreement to whether this is a mad max film or not     the original movie is about a group of bikies who end up killing maxs family and he begin to take revenge on the killers     this movie has nothing to do with max at all with him being in the wrong place at the wrong time     this movie revolves around formosa and immortal joe 2 great characters     visually this movie is unbelievable but it does fall weak in the plot     basically you want to strap yourself in for a 2 hour car chase then this movie is for you     but as for mad max he certainly aint mad and max isnt the definitive character in a movie that carries his namesake
May 15 2015,positive,madmaxfuryroad is 2hrs of nonstop explosive actionits rob zombie meets actionamazing stuntssome of best action scenes i have seen355
May 15 2015,negative,blah saw it today i cant believe all the good reviews this movie is getting there was littletono character development it was simply a roadrage assault of the senses for 2 solid hours i mean it had everything going for it a solid premise and setting fab actors they mustnt have had a writer maybe that was the problem there was almost no dialogue through the entire film and the star max  whoever he was he couldnt carry it  it actually had me missing mel gibson in the part cant stand him personally but he really brought a lot to the character anyway i just had to give me 2 penny review if you are hoping for an epic action movie with a good story and character development you can skip this one or maybe just turn your expectation meter way down and perhaps it will be better than you expect  youre welcome  
May 15 2015,positive,a truly incredible epic insane masterpiece   from action to characters to story this movie has it all hardy theron and hoult are fantastic and the cars oh my the cars
May 15 2015,positive,grab a pen take some notes micheal bay this is how you make an action movie  structure not really character development yeah right mel gibson well no amazing action sequences hell yeah
May 15 2015,positive,what an awesome movie loved it
May 15 2015,positive,a highoctane adrenaline ride that knows just when to shift gears to leave you breathless and satisfied
May 15 2015,positive,intense seems too small a word to describe the experience that is fury road this is action in its most extreme form yet unlike the michael bays of the word george miller choreographs visualises and allows the audience to truly become immersed in the chaos the cinematography is stunning the art direction is beyond anything weve seen and the story is strong enough to make a 2 hour car chase more believable than half the drull films we endure today its still a bmovie like its predecessors but the scale is gigantic and the ride so thrilling that this will be the mad max we remember in the years to come   it may not be the greatest movie of all time but as far as nonstop action movies go it may never get as good as this ever again its a film you are not likely to forget anytime soon so make sure you fuel up because this is one ride youll be taking over and over again
May 15 2015,positive,45 outta 5  mad max fury road absolutely assaulted my senses insanely fun    ive seen the mel gibson mad max movies but dont remember much about them after seeing fury road i dont know if id want to rewatch the classics because i know ill be bored since theres no way 70s80s action standards will be able to match todays adhd action    the movie starts with fastpaced action and ends with fastpaced action it was utter mayhem and i loved it crazy locales crazy characters crazy car chases crazy explosions crazy deaths crazy guitarstringing dude whose job is to do just that    the music was overwhelming at times but it pumped you up the fx was nearperfect almost couldnt tell what was cgi vs practical they tried to use as much practical effects as possible and it was an excellent choice the directing wasnt nauseating shakycam was kept to a minimum everything was visible you could tell what was happening that also applies to editscuts    tom hardy hardly spoke but he didnt really need to cuz his facial expressions and presence did the talking charlize theron has cemented her spot on the badasschick list nicolas hoult was overthetop but thats not a complaint    mad max fury road came close to toppling kingsman the secret service as my top movie of 2015
May 15 2015,positive,solid action solid script stylish as fuck
May 15 2015,positive,mad max fury road doesnt contain much dialogue it doesnt need to it is pure unadulterated visual poetry it could have utterly silent throughout its duration and the storytelling would have still had more heft and impact than the high majority of screenplays that we are subjected to every year as filmgoers    it is unquestionably the best action film of the past decade in fact its arguably the best action film of the last forty years and inarguably one of the five best action films over that period of time
May 15 2015,positive,loved it everything i was hoping for and then some more explosions d
May 15 2015,positive,perfect action movie in every way breathtaking action sequences minimal dialogue yet you still care for all the periphery characters charlize kicks ass as always
May 15 2015,positive,best of the year so far
May 15 2015,positive,one of the best films i have seen in a very very long time worth every penny
May 15 2015,positive,loud heavy wildly imaginative loud crazy beautiful loud epic loud loud loudloudloud
May 15 2015,negative,wow so many great reviews really i wasnt sure if i would go see it but i did disappointment and a waste of 24  i wanted to leave half way thru but stuck it out till the end 3d was a waste since you lose some detail in the viewing i am an action movie buff but this has few redeeming qualities outside the filming and special effects achieved  in studio plus they reduced max to a supporting role with very little dialogue  another hyped movie that doesnt live up to the hype seems like it has such a high rating i never see on most movies very suspicious ratings 5 years from now nobody will remember this movie but 30 years from now mel gibson mad max will be
May 15 2015,negative,i dont know what people see in this movie it sucked a lot
May 15 2015,positive,i cannot remember the last time i saw such a great movie the whole movie is wonderful juxtapositioning of contradictions which comes together more beautifully compellingly and provokingly than you would imagine anything could  walking out of the theater you feel a bit confused because you watched a movie that was so brutal graphic and actionpacked that you cannot understand why you feel haunted and moved emotionally  the experience of watching the movie is another example of how it juxtaposes seemingly contradictory elements flawlessly  it is the action movie against which all action movies should be judged the meat and potatoes of the movie is not the action rather the action is the conduit by which the movie tells a compelling story and evokes profound emotions  the layers of which these juxtapositions are throughout the movie are countless the bleak desert against a blue skybeautiful and haunting and profound the scene where the protags are attempting to pull the warrig out of the mud by using a pully around one of the last trees and the tree is beginning to uproot and fall over and you literally see man relying on nature to save him from his own follies while destructing nature at the same time in a an incredible few minutes  i could go on and on but i will just say one more thing the attention to detail in every aspect is the cherry on top in this movie
May 15 2015,positive,the first must see film of 2015
May 15 2015,positive,brilliant filmmaking the film should have been titled mad max and imperator furiosa charlize theron kicked some ass
May 15 2015,positive,this movie is fun in a grimy way its almost nonstop action
May 15 2015,positive,a must see while in theaters
May 15 2015,negative,wow what movie did the critics see that i missed  i thought mm fury road was disappointing  it is completely absent any of the emotion and story of the earlier movies  its yet another non stop action film with a dp more interested in trying and failing to make 3d meaningful
May 15 2015,positive,great action packed movie in 3d was unreal
May 15 2015,positive,cant wait for the next one
May 15 2015,positive,i rarely go out to watch movies anymore  my last was gravity also in 3d both films make worthwhile the drive the ticket price the stale popcorn and the filthy seats    there isnt much of a storyline and thats okay the spectacular photography spoton editing and magnificent score make for nonstop entertainment     george miller proves that you can be 70 and still direct an action film that will keep young viewers glued to the screen after ridley scotts last couple of duds prometheus and noah we were starting to wonder     the finale lays the groundwork for a sequel and thats just fine with me but in the meantime ill need to watch this the best of the mad max films so far once or twice more to catch the details that got by me amidst the speed flying body parts and explosions
May 15 2015,positive,excellent post apocalyptic thrill ride
May 15 2015,positive,mad max fury road could have been over hyped and a giant mess but it ended up being one of the greatest action films of all time this film had everything from action adventure drama bits of jocularity and much much more this is a must see for everyone even if you havent ever seen a mad max film before be sure to tell your friends to see it too word of mouth is going to ensure we get another mad max film  at this rate jj abrams is gonna have to do something magical to make star wars the best film of 2015 the bar has been set way too high
May 15 2015,negative,if i could give this a 0 i would this movie is without a doubt the worst movie i have ever seen i hesitate to call it a movie i feel like if i would have watched a trash can for two hours i would have gotten the same experience worst movie ever
May 15 2015,positive,absolutely amazing im definitely seeing it again and buying the bluray
May 15 2015,positive,crazy  great job remaking this classic
May 15 2015,positive,first i want state ive never seen the other mad maxs so this review is free of bias now on to the review i think fury road does suffer from an anticlimatic third act and theres so much going on in the action sequences you cant tell whats happening sometimes though i guess if it wasnt batshit crazy like that then it wouldnt capture that the world has completely lost its mind feel but this max is still enormously entertaining one of the best things about the movie is its use of practical effects most of the stunts and explosions are real with cgi only being used when absolutely necessary it show that cgis real purpose is to improve details not take over a whole movie the characters are all interesting with nux standing out specifically the best thing about the movie is how it pulls you into its world with all all its little details like using select women as bread era  and drinking mothers milk its a replacement to water its not just the world a ended the world is a wasteland it actually shows how they survive i applaud miller for putting that much detail in his film now i said before that the third act is anticlimactic and it is it feels like youre building to the biggest most epic battle sequence in the movie but it doesnt feel very different from earlier action sequences but i can still forgive that i mean how many action flicks can you think of that feature a dude standing on a car playing a flame spitting double neck guitar while theres a chase i honestly say this movie would be pretty fun if youre hammered not as a negative though im just saying with a movie as wild as this alcohol would make it more fun mad max is an amazing syfy at the endof the day and is the type of movie you have to experience in the theaters
May 15 2015,negative,fuck this boring movie
May 15 2015,positive,oh what a day what a lovely day
May 15 2015,positive,this movie was a gas guzzling adrenaline rush that was fantastic to experience in a theater and was equally fantastic as a visual splendor     fury road is pretty very pretty the whole plot of the movie seemed like an excuse to give you another post apocalyptic joyride through the new improved and rust ridden mad maxverse i cant really say any actor give ap articularly memorable performance because i was too distracted by the visuals
May 15 2015,positive,very good  dare i say better than the previous series of mm
May 15 2015,positive,this film felt like the full realization of george millers original postapocalyptic vision from aesthetics to adrenaline if anything it improved on the formula adding a dash of mystery and caper along with all the effects that are now possible in 2015 and the extra dose of feminism did not hurt either if you want a great summer action movie this is it
May 15 2015,positive,the greatest action movie ive ever seen   if you cant afford a trip to disney world step into mad max fury road for two hours and prepare for a thrill ride that   will electrify your senses dont walk to the theatre run     by far the best film of the year
May 15 2015,positive,i can easily admit this is not my cup of tea i can also easily acknowledge the amount of effort put into it and how great and spectacular of an experience it is but i cannot deny i was uninvested for the most part
May 15 2015,positive,mad max fury road was a good movie great no but good one of the best action movies ever this decade no but serviceable it is there are a few types of movies event driven dialogue driven and plot driven usually in event driven movies the events drive the movie and the dialogue is at a minimum this movie is event driven ironically another example of this would be the movie drive with ryan gosling the visuals narrate and tell the story this movie has action heart and moves briskly with great spacing its also good to see miller a seasoned vet taking the young thundercat directors to school visually stunning creative and bold you will enjoy this movie if you like post apocalyptic films but to put this in the pantheon of one of the greatest films ever um pump your breaks and just enjoy it for what it is great entertainment
May 15 2015,negative,this movie tries so hard to create a style like 300 or sin city but has such a terrible script that it goes nowhere there is lots of meaningless imagery but the over use of shaky cam really brings it down mel gibsons max evolved into a hero and had tons of character hardys max never amounts to anything other than a bit character i was bored to death a bunch of stupid acrobatics during a 2 hour car chase does not equal exciting
May 15 2015,positive,go see this movie
May 15 2015,positive,2 hours of not stop action incredible scenery great acting a really good summer movie
May 15 2015,positive,wasnt expecting muchpleasantly surprised and then some
May 15 2015,positive,all i can say is wow now that was worth the 30 year wait george miller did a fantastic job brining back of max and he did it without the use of cgi this is a must see i may need to see it again in imax 3d
May 15 2015,positive,wow  just wow  as i read in another review it really is spectacle over substance but who freaking cares  no there isnt much plot or character development but it is so perfectly choreographed and artistically woven together that i just dont care  i want to see more like this one  it is a treat unlike any other  if the oscars ignore this one for at least something im going postal  the highest recommendation i have ever given goes to this  no its not perfect but once again by the end you wont care
May 15 2015,positive,so awesome you will just have to see it
May 15 2015,neutral,in spite of the spectacular and mesmerizing stunts and effects in spite of an amazing charlize theron my enjoyment was inhibited by other more internal feelings first its a dystopian world squalor misery disease and oppression i get it however these and i use the word loosely people were so grotesque so monstrous so gruesome so aberrant they presented a world that i could not even root for the protagonists to survive in it was such a world of dread and vulgar mutants my depression overwhelmed my ability to separate it out and simply enjoy the visuals  speaking of visuals there were stunts like weve never seen before  however to achieve this never seen before quality the stunts were totally preposterous every law of physics gravity logic cause and effect were breathtakingly violated in this world seemingly comprised of only rabid dogs shaped into human form who the hell refined the infinite amount of gasoline they used who were the mechanics and auto body experts that built and maintained all of the crap they used what did the multitude of thousands of depraved  thirst starved inhabitants do when they were not all gathered at the rock tower of water dispensation  farmers factory workers business owners this world assaulted my logic to the degree that it pulled me out of the mindset the storyteller wanted me to lose myself in overall simply depressing
May 15 2015,positive,i think any review for mad max fury road can easily be either very short or very long there is no middle ground ill try and spare you    from frame one director george millers dystopian vision of the future takes hold of the viewer and doesnt let go ive never seen a movie that so effectively sets up its world its characters and its action with such ferocious tenacity itll be about 45 minutes into the film when you finally have a chance to breathe    while this is the fourth film in the mad max saga taking place between the second and third of the original movies there is no requirement to see the others first nor do you really have to be a fan of action in order to get into this vehicle rather the only requirement is that you enjoy movies the rest is taken care of by miller and co as your eyes and ears are assaulted with such beautiful chaos    the characters are just as colorful as the cinematography with tom hardy giving max such a great sense of character even having to say a word every bit his equal is charlize therons imperator furiosa theres been a lot of talk lately about female heroines in the realm of cinema these days you need look no further than this onearmed leader who serves as the real protagonist behind the events of fury road    the story can be summed up in a few sentences but explaining it would be a moot point this film is an experience the story itself is deceptively simple but george buries it within these characters and mythologies that lend the film so many layers i found myself wondering about places that are only mentioned or seen in the distance and how they looked liked and operated    the designs of what we do see are unparalleled this is a postapocalyptic world thats a total oxymoron its disgusting and beautiful chaotic yet well organized from the costumes to the many vehicles of fury road they couldnt have done a better job at constructing this world thats so offkilter and fun to play around in thankfully the actors who inhabit this world are capable of doing so much with so little screen time that would be impressive on its own but then we have the action    the action is unrelenting intense mesmerizing all of the other colorful adjectives youd want to use it makes every other action movie of the past decade look tame its been reported that 90 of the effects in this film are practical and it shows every hit have smash and every turn is felt by the viewer there were several times i felt the need to get up and leave the auditorium after an action scene as if i just finished a thrill ride    when you mix the locales the characters and the action altogether it makes for an unparalleled experience sitting in the theater and watching this movie unfold reminded me of other great theater experiences star wars terminator 2 judgment day the matrix now mad max fury road there is no other director who wouldve been capable of capturing this experience save for george miller     its important to rate a film in accordance to the genre it embraces in that regard fury road takes its competitors smashes them to bits and buries them in the sand
May 15 2015,positive,if you see one movie at the theater this year let it be mad max fury road
May 15 2015,positive,very will done rejuvenation of the max series beautiful scenery  backdrop great action
May 15 2015,positive,what is the deal definitely not a 5 star movie not sure whats wrong with rotten tomatoes ratings good but definitely not any where near the level of an avengers movie or other recent scifi efforts somethings rotten at rotten tomatoes i no longer trust its rating system and so called top critics what are they a bunch of kids in a back room rating this type movie something smells payoff or hacked rating values poorly written script goofy story line and parts of the action sequences just dont make sense at all recommend waiting till it comes out as a online streaming rental not worth the theater prices and especially not the 3d version  please rotten critics save your 5 star ratings for a movie that actually deserves it
May 15 2015,positive,mad max fury road is a rambunctious feast burned to chromelike heat by stunning steampunk inspired visuals and mesmerizing performances from theron and hardy paired with a thoughtful commentary on ecological catastrophe and feminism     miller has crafted what is easily the best film of 2015 and by most accounts a milestone in the action movie genre this is brilliant catastrophe at scale both wellrealized and expertly choreographed few films can match the relentless insanity that is mad max and for a director in his 70s miller has vastly outdone his younger peers  whose shakycamcg antics are laid bare as nothing more than cheap trinkets    well done george miller
May 15 2015,positive,i have seen it twice in the last 24 hours and i cannot wait to see it again yes its that good  tom is fantastic as max and charlize finds the right balance between brute force and tired warrior the movie is stunning to look atjust amazing in 3dthe colors the sounds the action sequences are flawless it is a must see  more than once i took my boys 12 and 10 to see it and they were blown away  they only know cgi action and video games so to see practical action movie making it was spectacular for them to behold  they couldnt imagine all of that was real and to be honest neither could i  amazing
May 15 2015,positive,mad max fury road is without a doubt the most metal film ive ever seen the action is universally incredible and thats obviously a good thing since this film is about 80 action theres something truly refreshing about a film that isnt afraid of its own absurdity mad max fury road creates an atmosphere of eternal pain hatred and violence while somehow leaving room for flamethrowerguitar playing metalhead raiders riding tweaked out monster trucks in the process this my friends is action cinema done right
May 15 2015,positive,the bwst movie of 2015 so far and will certainly remain that way simply stunning and with beatiful female models too
May 15 2015,positive,action tense explosions bit bonkers it was perfect
May 15 2015,positive,road warrior   nough said
May 15 2015,positive,fantastic movie all around that is just one of those alltime great action thrillers
May 15 2015,positive,the best madd maxx ever
May 15 2015,positive,fury road is a true cinematic masterpiece  a visual marvel and insane action spectacle that left me breathless george miller has created something truly special and unique a new mad max for a new generation yet somehow it feels right at home next to the original trilogy cant wait to see it again
May 15 2015,positive,would have got five if hardy could keep an aussie accent
May 15 2015,positive,excellent movie with all the cgi and fancy production that 21st century hollywood can muster barely any references to the first 2 films but a far more slicker and eye popping film as a result
May 15 2015,positive,an extremely exhilarating high octane thriller that is a real rollercoaster ride of a movie an easily worthwhile addition to the mad max series
May 15 2015,positive,the hype going into it was unreal for me i really didnt want to be disappointed with this film and i wasnt one bit  i went in blind not knowing what to expect only knowing how good people have been saying it is  and i can truly tell you it was the best movie of 2015 so far in my book at least
May 15 2015,positive,well its been a while but sometimes maybe thats not a bad thing 30 years since mad max beyond the thunderdome and unlike its predecessor mad maxfury road does not disappoint     fans of the first two movies will enjoy this as anyone else seeking a tense action road thriller     nothings changed really the mad max world created by george miller is still ugly lawless and messed up the opening shot reintroduces us to max now played by tom hardy and proves a very appropriate piece of casting before the opening in credit are done max reminds us of who he is and the world he lives in is kidnapped escapes recaptured brandished tattooed and used as a blood bag for a war boy played by nicholas hoult who shavedheaded and covered in white body paint took me a moment to realize it was him     he is a war boy for immortan joe a horrible and wonderfully depicted ruler and villain  he has hundreds of bald war boys at his disposal and has control of the water supply in whatever part of the postapocalyptic world we find ourselves in furosia played by the also hardly recognizable charlize theron is assigned to drive a war rig to collect gasoline for joe she has an envoy with her of joes men armed in case of attack    but furosia betrays joe looking to return to where she had been kidnapped from by joe and also helping some of joes young beautiful brides to escape not wanting their babies to become property of joe and so we begin a nail biting 2 hour car chase across this desolate world where there is only a glimmer of hope    director george miller does a wonderful job with his locations and shots the desert in namibia is a wonderful and colorful backdrop which miller uses to its fullest this is an old hand doing what he knows and doing it well i must also compliment the restraint used in the script dialogue is kept to a minimum the actors respond with subtle reactions telling us what we need instead of using words this is a director who totally understands the medium he is working on    hardy theron and hoult all deliver great performances hugh keybyrnes joe is wonderfully grotesque rosie huntingtonwiley is the lead bride who thankfully has learn some acting skills since we saw her in transformers dark of the moon     the movie is like a windup toy car and once you let go its off its tense and exciting stuff and not overcomplicated it keeps it simple and does it effectively    for me it was very nice to see the the female roles especially theron giving and receiving as much action as any of the males characters do theres also really nice roles for some wonderful older female actors a rarity theres a lovely equilibrium to the movie everyone is on the same playing field    its a nice contrast to all the cgi heavy action movies whos scripts and plots seem to be lost in the sound and look of digital explosions and effects mad max fury road keeps it simple and does it well best action movie of the year so far sorry avengers
May 15 2015,positive,i dont want to see another action movie not directed by george miller its like i died and got reborn again
May 15 2015,positive,an exceptional surprise really worth it
May 15 2015,positive,george miller returns to the australian postapocalyptic wasteland after 30 years and it doesnt disappoint  with stunning visuals and fast pace action fury road barely gives you time to breathe its pumped with so much adrenaline that you cant help but feel physically warn out once the credits roll  tom hardy is a suitable replacement for max even if his accent isnt quite on point but who really steals the show therons furiousa a strong female warrior with a a robotic arm an expertise in firearms and driving and a big heart  with a terrifying villain mad max is scary exciting fun and just plain batsht crazy  fury road is a worthy entry to the franchise and washes the bad taste of beyond thunderdome out of our mouths
May 15 2015,positive,light on character dev too violent non stop action
May 15 2015,positive,ben hurs chariot scenes on lsd thats what i proclaimed to my friends when i left the cinema and that isnt a bad thing infact its the polar opposite  george miller has been away from his seminal post apocalyptic wasteland franchise mad max for 30 years and i think its safe to say he is back and better than ever even at the grand old age of 70 miller has created a fast paced pedal to the metal extravaganza that never loosens its grip on you for the full 120 minute running time with mind boggling practical stunts and incredible moments of cgi not to mention some awesome world building with the diffrent clans and characters we see or meet along this chaotic viceral and visually staggering journey mad max fury road is an action masterclass  and will surely become a modern classic its lite and simple yet still intriguing plot is  pushed forward  with great performances from hugh keaysbyrnetoecutter from the original mad max tom hardy nicholas holt and the real stand out charlize theron fury road shows how a modern blockbuster should be done and is my favourite film of 2015 so far and also one of the best pure action movies your likely to see in a very long time fury road dosent just rewrite the script for acton movie blockbusters it powers through them and leaves all modern competition choking on its fumes
May 15 2015,negative,if you liked mad max original you wont like this dragged on and on
May 15 2015,positive,it was awesome i loved every minute of it
May 15 2015,positive,solid movie it will appear to get a little over the top for some parts but thats part of the fun imo
May 15 2015,positive,must see in the theater without distraction the guitarist steals the show
May 15 2015,positive,almost perfect action flick no more 3d
May 15 2015,positive,saw it in 3dit was a w e s o m e  despite getting pins in needles in my hands through the movieit was still worth sitting through the 2 hr movie  ive never been a big fan of dragged out action scenes but the scenes were so well done that it was kind of like watching an apocalyptic cirque du soleil
May 15 2015,positive,amazing  it is a visual masterpiece 
May 15 2015,negative,the entire story cant be longer than 10 mins the rest is special effects and fights boring
May 15 2015,positive,bizarre and weird characaters as to be expected  the same 80s explosions and action with todays special effects make for a fun adventure with some meaningful themes the impact comes up a little short
May 15 2015,positive,mad maxs triumphant return after a 30year hiatus is everything i wanted it to be and so much more with some of the craziest stuntscar crashes i have ever seen in my life yeah its that good tom hardy is a welcome replacement for mel gibson in the lead role but it is charlize theron who steals the show here and completely owns her role as a badass takenoshit fighter and will likely go down as one of the best female heroines weve had the story is just enough to propel the action and the film is literally a 2hour chase scene with all kinds of mayhem and madness that is right at home in this insane universe and im still baffled wondering how they pulled it all off this is easily the wackiest entry in the mad max series with some straightup bizarre character moments but its all in good fun and i had a stupid grin on my face throughout see this on the bigscreen as its made for the theatrical experience and you may be quoting dickie roberts on your way out that was nucking futs
May 15 2015,positive,im not a fan imagine if i was
May 15 2015,positive,its like the editor in chiefs of heavy metal and bust got together took a bunch of peyote and watched all of the mad max and fast  furious movies and then made the best postapocalyptic action movie of all time
May 15 2015,positive,i only liked the action scenes the acting was boring
May 15 2015,positive,outfuckingstanding
May 15 2015,positive,a breathless first half more than makes up for a good second half and a flimsy premise one of the most exhilarating movie of 2015  what a movie what a crazy movie
May 15 2015,positive,dear moviegoers born after 1993    mad max fury road is a what a slambang actionadventure is supposed to look and feel like featuring some of the most amazing action sequences yet filmed along with these things called stunts directormaestro george miller brings us back to postapocalyptic australia like the last 30 years were just yesterday max now played by tom hardy teams up with imperator furiousa who is attempting to smuggle immortin joesoh screw it dude if your a mad max fan the last thing your here for is plot and characters whats important is this charlize theron absolutely kills it as imperator furiousa the most badass female action hero since ellen ripley first strapped on her flame thrower the only sore spot here is the casting of max the always superb tom hardy feels miscast here never quite equalling the charm and charisma that the exiled mel gibson so effortlessly brought to the role this however does little if anything to take away from the visceral thrills and stunning visuals that await you buckle up seriously
May 15 2015,positive,mediokarrr i thought it was unreasonable for any summer action flick to have such ridiculous ratings but if there was anything higher than five stars i wouldve gone with that unmissable
May 15 2015,positive,that may of been the artsiest action movie i have ever seen the action is spectacular its more than that this may be the best action i have ever seen in any movie ever yet at times the film is actually really compelling there is an emotional core to this film and the performances are actually dare i say powerful you heard it here james says mad max is powerful this is a weird day
May 15 2015,positive,mad max was not a 1010 its an 1110    finally someone put out a great movie
May 15 2015,positive,one long car chase amazing technical stunts and some really cool characters but everything was really shallow you never got to really know any characters including mad max and there was not much intrigue to the plot     im kind of surprised by how much hype this movie is getting
May 15 2015,positive,there are movies that take some time to settle in after a first viewing before you can really decide how you feel about them  mad max fury road happens to be one of those movies it isnt due to a complex narrative or deeply written characters though its because for two hours you eyes will bear witness to a nonstop barrage of inyourface high octane action that really has to be seen to be believed george miller has successfully pulled his acclaimed series into the 21st century with a film that stands both on its own and one that pays plenty of homage to the franchises roots the dialogue and story play second fiddle to the epic action and the filmmakers dont pretend otherwise impressively for a movie focused on vehicular warfare though there are really no clichés to be found even with the minimal dialogue every character feels fleshed out and fully realized especially the star of the show no not tom hardy charlize theron fury road is everything i could have hoped for and fans of the series will surely feel the same way
May 15 2015,positive,visually stunning  if youre looking for anything more than highoctane action packed live fire and explosions youve come to the wrong screening  all the actors do a phenomenal job in their respective roles  low on dialogue with bits and pieces of narration at the beginning to get you on your way  2 double barreled shotguns for this one
May 15 2015,positive,its a spectacle the music and cinematography captures the movie like an opera in adrenaline
May 15 2015,negative,as of today mad max fury road holds the title for the loudest movie of 2015 though from what i saw of summer previews it may not hold it for too long     it has been 30 years since the original mad max trilogy and memory may be wrong but i remember a deeper and more involving  story along with a young mel gibson showing more emotion than the current max played by tom hardy i have heard and read a lot about mr hardy in the past couple of years but i think i have only seen him in two movies those being inception and dark knight rises but i have no recollection of him in either the camera gives him a lot of close ups in this film so i am sure i will recognize him in future films    getting an equal amount of  face time if not a little more and the only reason i went to see this film is charlize theron who plays imperator furiosa looks great even with a dirty face raccoon eye makeup short cropped black hair and a mechanical left hand and is the equal if not better than any man hero her eyes are a movie without cgi effects on their own    the first five minutes of mad max fury road are quiet and then the incessant loud music the races car chases one action scene after another begin to wear the audience down within a 2 hour movie there might be 15 minutes total without mayhem in every form possible it reached a point that i was wondering how many scenes were done in front of a green screen how many were fake how many were performed by stunt people all the while that long music ruled by drums fills the auditorium there is one remarkable scene of just hardy raising up from the desert sand that made me think wow     with a huge cast the standouts are theron nathan jones nicholas hoult the 5 wives especially riley keough and trust me you wont want to meet any of the female sexagenarians in a dark alley or the desert    the direction by george miller offers every action fans dreams while the screenplay by miller  brendan mccarthy and nico lathouris is simple it is said miller already has the next mad max film prepped named furiosa and if true i hope it brings back theron    after the avengers last week and this week mad max i can honestly say i have had my fill of summer blockbusters
May 15 2015,positive,the plot could have used some twists i got a little bored with the repetitive explosions and stunts and started looking at my watch at the end
May 15 2015,positive,such an insane ride that never lets up loved it theron did a great job in it a noteworthy role for her
May 15 2015,positive,awesome movie   a must see for mad max fans  i wish that mel gibson would have been max  just doesnt seem right without him
May 15 2015,positive,the action sequences were great the storyline and dialogue were something to be desired mad max barely had any dialogue and the characters had zero development     the film producers definitely screwed the pooch by not filming this movie in imax imagine that mad max in imax the cinematography and special effects were awesome in standard viewing but wouldve been amazing in imax
May 15 2015,positive,awesome flick
May 15 2015,positive,one of the most thrilling action packed visually awesome movies ive ever seen all while being presented with important themes and naritive
May 15 2015,positive,miller returns 30 years later and his retrograde action epic is more welcome than ever on the big screen hardy plays the silent troubled max beautifully but theron is outstanding as the woman on a mission of freedom furiosa mad max fury road is meticulously crafted bloodpumping action filled mayhem that offers that rarest of things a movie that is 100 as the director intended maxs triumphant return to the big screen is not successful just because of the violence it is successful because of the craft and the beating heart and working brain beneath the bonnet not to mention a truly horrific villain in immortan joe chaos glorious chaos
May 15 2015,positive,absolutely fantastic best action movie in a long time
May 15 2015,positive,mad max is well mad bonkers cars crazy characters and so many incredible gripping action sequences   definite rewatch
May 15 2015,neutral,passable but ultimately underwhelming given the hype max isnt even the main character
May 15 2015,positive,all the drama of lorenzos oil three times the giddiness of babe more foot tap inducing than all of the penguins of happy feet and even madder than mel gibson  george millers latest is a truly madly insane ride of a film
May 15 2015,negative,this movie has very little to do with mad max its go lots of action but maz takes a total back seat to charlize theron
May 15 2015,positive,in an age of disneyfied action and cgi drivel fury road comes out of the gate with a swift kick to the gut and shattering your brain if there ever were an action blockbuster with enough heft worthy of a best picture nomination this would be the one if you only see one movie for the rest of the year check out fury road its the genuine movie of the summer 
May 15 2015,positive,cant remember a movie this decade that was better than mad max attention to detail was impeccable action was awesome yet believable one of the few reeboots that blow the original away this is the one must see this year
May 15 2015,positive,great action but very madly strange
May 15 2015,positive,only 5 stars cos cant give 10 d best movie since avatar
May 15 2015,positive,best action adventure  scifi thriller
May 15 2015,positive,excellent simply excellent so much more enjoyable than the latest round of superhero movies
May 15 2015,negative,mad fury i was fing livid
May 15 2015,positive,gasoline fire and madness mad maxs return is a triumph of aggressive visual filmmaking paving the road with a strong use of practical effects and unrelenting action
May 15 2015,positive,most action films nowadays usually work toward one massively explosive moment some of these incendiary climaxes have been impressive some have not just when it seemed like audiences were going to be subjected to only one kind of action film in comes george miller with a plethora of explosive moments all piled into one action extravaganza that trounces those in its path thats right mad max is back and better than ever put aside superheroes for now and witness the resurrection of true action mad max fury road delivers on the promise of highoctane thrills and then some to say that it is simply awesome is a complete understatement it succeeds not only as a rocksolid piece of entertainment but also as an astounding work of art in every sense of the word millers handle on the action sequences is typically marvelous however it is the perfect mix of topnotch stunt work and eyepopping cgi that give every crash and burn a visceral punch stellar production design colorful cinematography and expert editing also play no small part in making millers magnum opus one of the most original action films of all time i stress the word original because lets face it youre unlikely to see another film with a car speeding through the desert decked out with over twenty loud speakers and a guy violently strumming an electric guitar with flames shooting out of its neck summer blockbusters simply do not get much better than that other than the awesome car chases and collisions one of the biggest surprises that the film has to offer is an emotional core that is far more effective than those of the previous mad max entries miller pumps a fine amount of blood into the heart of the film and though it may not beat as lively as it could the exceptional performances provided by the cast make it beat fast enough tom hardy fills the shoes of max left by mel gibson fairly well while charlize theron powerfully carries most of narratives weight with a feminist edge those who have not yet seen millers first three mad max films fear not fury road works as a fresh new start for younger generations as well as an astounding continuation of millers postapocalyptic world that does not stand in the shadow of its predecessors believe me when i say that this film is more than just a great sequel mad max fury road is one of the best films of the decade and will soon be regarded as an action classic
May 15 2015,positive,amazing ride so much action throughout the film
May 15 2015,neutral,really busy blowing things up and not so interested in good characters this is sure to please adolescent boys of all ages but the constant assault to the senses holds little else for people that expect more than action and explosions from their summer entertainment
May 15 2015,positive,loved this movie perfect mix between the storyline and the action sequences
May 15 2015,positive,its a mad mad world out there in millers stupendous creation relentlessrip roaring exhilarating are some of the words you will be left with when u leave the theaterfury road leaves u high on a seemingly endless dose of adrenaline packed nonstop action throughout its 2 hr runtimeperformances are sublime cinematography and the directors vision is mind blowing but the ultimate winners at the end of thrilling extravaganza will b adrenaline junkies and the fanboys
May 15 2015,positive,what i got to say about mad max fury road is okay to an exceptional of a movie the action in this movie is spectacular in every sense of the word the performances by the cast is fine tom hardy and charlize theron does prove to us that they both can be a badass can they pull it off you answer should be hell yes the directing by george miller is really good but the screenplay by brendan mccarthy nick lathouris and eric blakeney is poorly written for my opinion i didnt understand the storyline of the movie plus there wasnt an character development the cinematography and choreography are excellent the score i like it works good and the movie finally the effects are perfect what i have to report about mad max fury road is if you a fan of good action movies then this movie is perfect for you but if you looking for a movie with good storytelling i can tell you that this movie wouldnt deliver that at all
May 15 2015,positive,actionpacked but sorely lacking in intelligent storytelling mad max fury road is an exciting escape for those wanting to completely shut off their minds i couldnt help leaving the theater wanting something more though
May 15 2015,positive,great film i never saw road warrior or thunderdome yet i feel like tom hardy was able to pick up right where mel left off  charlize theron is phenomenal as usual  i think it harkens back to the 80s90s movies that were flat out actionpacked yet had something to say beyond violence for violences sake  not as gory as you might think from the trailer which was good but do be prepared for some strange and twisted characters and happenings
May 15 2015,positive,im going to have to be that guy and admit that i didnt like this as much on second viewing  i dont think my opinion about any of the parts has changed but my relative weighting of their importance has shifted  ill say right up front i dont think this is a bad film  a lot of it is more than a little exceptional  the action scenes especially the final chase are incredible  its pretty much everything else about it that i could do without  the story and characters are pretty dumb  thats not a new thing  its pretty much true of all the films in this series and its what really buries the 3rd one  but in past films none of the bad elements are amped up to absurd levels through the use of excessive cgi and a ridiculously frenetic pace  if you consider the road warrior that films grounding in a very real seeming physicality gives its broad sketchy characters the aura of archetypes  its like a post apocalyptic western  this film feels like a cartoon or maybe a video game  a really really good one but still  a video game
May 15 2015,positive,i wish more action movies were made like this instead of chasing blueglowing macguffins and cgi superheroes
May 15 2015,positive,one of the best action movies ive seen in my life 1010 must see
May 15 2015,positive,unbelievable action never seen anything like that wow
May 15 2015,positive,probably the best action movie i have ever seen it is literally that good my face is melted off now i am going to have to wear a mask like immortan joe
May 15 2015,positive,im usually not a 55 star guy but this is pretty great
May 15 2015,positive,just saw it  loved every minute of it  the backgrounds the action the stunts tom hardy nicolas hoult and especially charlize theron  not to mention several other beautiful women  the best picture in the mad max series  truly epic
May 15 2015,positive,great movie flatters the original without being a horrible copy cat i will see it at least once more while in the theater to take advantage of the big screen and sound system as in this case it really makes for an excellent viewing experience
May 15 2015,positive,easily one of the best action movies ever made nonstop fun i was smiling the entire film
May 15 2015,negative,didnt explain enoughthe fights were all the samealmost fell asleep twice
May 15 2015,positive,this film has nonstop action from beginning to end it is not just about a fight for gasoline and water instead it is about gaining freedom from a dictator imortan joe this is a must see    dr aaron j miller
May 15 2015,positive,perhaps one of the best action movies ever made george miller seems to have outdone himself again delivering the best mad mad movie to date and one of the best action packed cinematic experiences of the last decade eclipsing even the legendary road warrior this is a must see movie experience for casual movie goers and action junkies worldwide
May 15 2015,positive,fury road was visually stunning the soundtrack was totally metal and the acting was very solid  it was everything youd expect from a mad max film and then some  my only complaint and its pretty minor was that it was a bit light on the plot it could have used more dialogue  if you like the mad max films in the slightest you should see this  if you like action films you should see this  if you like visually stunning movies you should see this        go  see it
May 15 2015,positive,movie was so good i didnt want to leave my seat to go to the bathroom so i pissed my pants and just sat in my filth until the movie ended it was that good
May 15 2015,positive,great fun exactly what i was hoping for this film does what it does best unapologetically and does not try and get to righteous or cerebral in the process sit down strap in and enjoy the ride
May 15 2015,positive,so fucked up but so awesome
May 15 2015,positive,a perfect action movie thats what this is few movies attain that rank and the ones that do all have the same qualities unique visual style totally evil villain a reluctant hero rich but mostly implied backstory and of course thrills mad max delivers on all levels best of which is its world building were a rich post apocalypse is presented with almost zero explanation leaving the imagination to wonder about the giant sandstorms and ominous sounding bullet farms imperator furiosa along with having one of the coolest names of all time is a great lead and she and max play brilliantly off eachother the movies story is simple and primal serving to enrich every beat of the action while also never distracting from it like 300 or die hard or rambo first blood max max fury road is one for the action history books
May 15 2015,positive,some of the most amazing action sequences ive ever seen how someone doing stunts on this movie did not die is amazing    i highly recommend seeing this movie on the biggest screen you can and absolutely watch it in 3d this movie has some great avatar level 3d effects
May 15 2015,positive,mouthguard recommended the adrenaline coursing through your veins will have your teeth grinding like a junkie
May 15 2015,positive,the real fastfurious vin diesel should grab some popcorn and chill stunning metal trash opera w amazing kinetic energy braking is for loosers only theron and hardy are a hell of a couple
May 15 2015,positive,not the original but an excellent remake nonstop action and a fun time
May 15 2015,positive,mad   bad  and  brilliant
May 15 2015,positive,insane beyond epic
May 15 2015,positive,fury road made the prior mad max movies feel like drivebys  the movie stayed close to the original form in many ways  continuous action lots of explosions fast cars and bikes great stunt work and pretty girls  the only downside was the volume was way too loud  i should have brought earplugs
May 15 2015,positive,wacky works its amazing to see that an 80sstyle epic and an updated visual style though still owing a lot to the 80s still works today added by visually stunning narratives and a compelling  though wacky  story that leaves you amazed by the freshness against todays overlystructured and plotted serializations great actors wonderful soundtrack amazing visuals  odd but fresh plot it works
May 15 2015,positive,a great addition that sets a new bar for mad max hope they make more
May 15 2015,positive,best action film in many years just mind blowing 5 star film
May 15 2015,neutral,95 fighting  should have just had subtitles
May 15 2015,negative,i just read an article about the critics thought it was great who are the critics and where do they find them it was corny linear in story line and the plot seemed like it was written on a cocktail napkin they spent nearly 90 minutes of the movie driving in the desert just to do a u turn and drive back to the place they left what a waste
May 15 2015,positive,495     pros    nicholas hoult steals the film   the action is crazy good and always     fast paced  tom hard proves twice in a row a car    ride can be amazing
May 15 2015,positive,fck me epic is too small a word for this beast sheer cinematic adrenaline im high
May 15 2015,positive,do ya like movies about postapocalyptic wastelands what about movies with strong female characters that fight back against oppression how about explosions how about movies with real explosions and not just ones created by a 24yearold on a computer if so go see this immediately
May 15 2015,positive,the best movie of 2015 so far and the best mad max movie ever 
May 15 2015,positive,so ridiculously crazy and over the top this must be seen on the big screen
May 15 2015,positive,postapocalyptic epic adventure  one of the best of the year the story is simple but much more engaging with the characters than the original trilogy the action scenes 90 in vehicles are top noch adrenaline pumped and tense  the setting and society is bizarre crazy a must see 8510
May 15 2015,positive,one insane ride post apocalyptic genre is creeping up higher in my list of favs after edge of tomorrow and mad max
May 15 2015,positive,loud great in 3d way actionpacked loved the effects great cgi the cars were on point
May 15 2015,positive,destined to be a classic
May 15 2015,negative,94 positive i must be hallucinating   be honest 700 of you are friends of miller after seeing the trailers i know what mel gibson was laughing about as he watched the movie this is not mad max this is emasculated max taking a backseat to feminist ideology hollywood has truly reached an all time low with this pathetic neutering of a once great character    im curious to see how this does tonight it may trick more more than a few men into watching it lord willing these ratings will drop way down once the truth gets out on how bad this movie really is bide your time gents and save your money its nothing more than another piece of feminist propaganda
May 15 2015,positive,fury road was a non stop in your face ride that propelled me into the post apocalyptic world without a shadow of remorse to whether you know what the fuck was going on     true to its core theme the film brought itself to a whole new level in narrating though protagonists whom youd have no idea who is through the middle it reminded me of how i first watched a new hope yet expecting the vibe of road warrior that never came but i wasnt disappointed as i cheered imperator furiosa charlize theron and grit my teeth through the seamless edits of the epic
May 15 2015,positive,poetic visually beautiful and badass a must see movie
May 15 2015,positive,the story is lacking but the action was awesome
May 15 2015,positive,not all visions are visionary and millers mad max does more of the same with a film that benefits more from good timing than it does from quality its hard not to be impressed by the scope of the set pieces its harder to think of it as anything more a solid entertainment that gives summer audiences what they cant find elsewhere kudos to miller for that but its not a masterpiecenot by a long stretch
May 15 2015,positive,enough action to keep you enterteined
May 15 2015,positive,the best action movie of the new millenium
May 15 2015,positive,having grown up with the original three mad max films and dying to see another one for over 20 years now i can honestly say that this film surely exceeded all my expectations added a bigger view of what exactly makes up this wasteland world and new excitingcompelling characters to the mix i have currently seen this film 3 times now and am anxiously awaiting the release date to purchase this i am very much looking forward to the next adventure in mad maxs world
May 15 2015,positive,loved it but it wasnt perfect maxs character took a weird turn but charlize therons role made up for it loved minimal cgi  the stunts  vehicles
May 15 2015,positive,mad max fury road movie review by the movie slackers this is a funny video movie review about mad max fury road featuring movie information and a lot of dry humor this film stars tom hardy charlize theron and nicholas hoult this film is directed produced and cowritten by george miller  mad max fury road final trailer review 
May 15 2015,positive,postapocalyptic genre had finished
May 15 2015,positive,visually stunning great car chases great cinematography fantastic sets and vehicles storyline is pretty decent charlize is easily the best actor in this tom hardy seems to mumble every line and his dialect seems to ramble from us to uk to oz and a little gibsongreat big screen watching i dont really know how it got 98 7580 seems more reasonable
May 15 2015,positive,nitro filled mayhem with a plot dont expect many rest stops along the way
May 15 2015,positive,outstanding film one of the top action movies ive seen in theatres in the past 15 years
May 15 2015,positive,freaking brilliant
May 15 2015,positive,wow just wow i went to see this movie saturday night with my fiancé and we were absolutely blown away by it im a fan of the original movies so when i heard that max wasnt the main character in this movie i was concerned i shouldnt have been the pacing of the movie was fast and the action was intense and visceral you can practically feel every punch gunshot and car crash    speaking of cars they provide star power in their own right the freakish frankencar designs were entertaining and added yet another visual spectacle to the film the stunts were amazing as well charlize theron was excellent as furiosa and tom hardy was very good if underutilized as max screw the mra go see this movie
May 15 2015,positive,quite possibly the best action movie ive ever seen
May 15 2015,positive,this is an instant action classic best summer movie its a nonstop ride with a meaning
May 15 2015,positive,without a doubt the best out and out action ive seen in a long time
May 15 2015,positive,thank you miller to bring action back with a capital a a masterpiece of chaos
May 15 2015,positive,george miller comes out to play and shows the young kids how its done with the newest entry in the legendary mad max series tom hardy and charlize theron are excellent in the lead roles and the supporting cast turn in equally impressive performances junkie xl provides a thunderous and memorable score and more than enough for me to have faith that his contribution to batman v superman will be great however the true power player is miller himself who conducts some utterly insane action spectacle that makes other action filmmakers look like childs play by comparison with cg only used when absolutely necessary the blood sweat and tears put into these sequences are there for all to see and put together with some truly gorgeous cinematography that dazzles with every shot hopefully this film finds an audience because the world needs more adventures of the wandering road warrior and if it happens you can be sure ill be there opening night
May 15 2015,positive,if you want to get punched in the teeth over and over which such over the top goodness than go see this movie  the acting and plot were fine however the  action scenes vehicles were all stellar  i couldnt stop laughing because of its over the top badassness    i loved it so much im going home to punch my mom right in the nuts  enough said
May 15 2015,negative,i dont even have the words for the way i felt during this film really but i think meh might cover it for anyone who isnt a fan of these types of movies steer clear this isnt going to convert you
May 15 2015,positive,simply one of the best action movies ever made
May 15 2015,positive,some of the best stunts or seen in a film for a long long time   anyone who sees it wont be disappointed

May 15 2015,positive,visually mesmerizing fantastic action sequences with great heart and epics moments that youll remember mad max fury road is the best in the series and one of the best action films in this decade amazing 9610
May 15 2015,positive,insanity in all of its glory truly a spectacle a ride unlike any other george miller you brilliant bastard lolz absolutely love this movie d
May 15 2015,positive,wow this movie was amazing i didnt expect to be so well done this is the best  of the mad max series see it in a theater this is a must see film
May 15 2015,positive,mind blowing visuals i was exhausted by the end of it because of its nonstop action george miller has raised the bar so high for action movies itll be interesting to see what can top this
May 15 2015,positive,this is unarguably the best action movie of the 21st century and its not even worth comparing to movies of the 20th century because it is entirely a new beast asking if its better than the road warrior would be like asking who is better at rock n roll metallica or elvis its just not comparable    this 30 year culmination of george millers genius is literally flawless there is a 5 second made for 3d scene that comes out of nowhere and is so uninvited that it makes you think it is an intentional flaw like cindy crawfords mole    outside of that 5 seconds though the movie is phenomenal the thought and effort that went into every noncgi action sequence is incomprehensible i wouldnt be surprised at all to find out that george milelr had been plotting these scenes over the last 20 years as he made childrens movies    its a shame this movie does not have a 100 because it truly deserves it just know that the sole critic who found this movie dull mick lasalle loved 50 shades of grey and fast and the furious 7 while hating bird man he also wrote a book called beauty of the real he doesnt deserve to wipe the piss off george millers toilet bowl    go see this movie in theaters if you havent
May 15 2015,positive,solid action not enough max
May 15 2015,positive,mad max fury road sets a new benchmark for action films george miller lets the viewer traverse through the postapocalyptic era in stunning fashion the visuals are dazzling colorful and filled with insane characters out of the performances charlize therons furiosa stood out that does not necessarily imply that a movie titled mad max has little in store for tom hardy he gets a higher screen presence in the second hour and is adequately supported by nicholas hoult the gang of antagonists led by immortan joe two thumbs up for the guy with the electronic guitar flamethrower rocking away amidst all the mayhem were menacing in looks and kept their presence felt throughout the dialogues may be lacking and the character development is pretty much negligible even for max himself  but the action is nonstop and the setpieces are executed extremely well cinematography art and concept design departments deserve a special mention in short max is back and hes got swag like major
May 15 2015,positive,whooo     i hadnt realized how long its been since ive gotten such a rush in the theatre after seeing this film i tore off to watch the 30yearold prequels and while they were awesomely entertaining in their own right nothing can compare to the budget this film put to excellent use     i havent seen a film use such primal visual storytelling in ages it rarely resorting to something as typical as dialogue to get through a story that is as barebones as it is compelling     and hats off to george for delivering a film that not once not even once made me feel like i should be ashamed of my gender     who else is hoping for a crossover with tank girl long live desert punk
May 15 2015,positive,solid no bull shit action flick with an exceptional art department no more and no less
May 15 2015,positive,the hardest thing i have to think about after watching this is where it fits in my top 10 favorite movies of all time list its that good
May 15 2015,positive,by far one of the most visually amazing and visceral films i have ever seen prepare to have your face melt into a pool atop your popcorn cuz there aint nothin like this anywhere
May 15 2015,positive,relentlessly awesome awesomely relentless thrilled to see its receiving the recognition it deserves
May 15 2015,positive,the most insane high adrenaline mad max yet another complete full step forward in the series
May 15 2015,positive,the most metal movie ive seen in years
May 15 2015,positive,just got back from watching this film twice and just wanted to share my thoughts on it can you believe they dont have a single imax show in hong kong for this movie not one and they got avengers age of ultron 2015 still playing in all of the imax screens in hong kong its criminal anyway about this movie its gonna be long so read only if youre interested and have time to spare    from the moment the comiccon trailer was unveiled to the world it was pretty obvious that this movie was going to be something else then the subsequent trailers only proved that further all the behind the scenes rumours and stories about the troubled production the two leads not getting along well the clashes with the studios reshoots and what not seem to have been exaggerated because you dont get the kind of final results that you see in this movie if everything was falling apart during production the final quality of this film pretty much blows those rumours to dust what we have here is a miracle of a movie in times when comic book nonsense is taking over cinema those cgi live action cartoons from marvel studios flooding the big screens and forcing smaller indie films or big original films with grand and bold ideasfilmmaking to be either sidetracked or not given the release they deserve and sometimes the audience was not ready for such films a la edge of tomorrow 2014    this film is quite an achievement as far as filmmaking is concerned with 150million dollar rrated blockbusters being something of a rarity these days the fact that this even exists is incredible i mean when was the last time you saw a major blockbuster that was rated r and was made for grown upsadults and not geared towards the adhd pg13 crowd for that alone this movie deserves all the praise its getting especially the fact that it does not blows that opportunity and actually comes out with a winning product its brutal and intense without being over the top violent there are violent and graphic moments that makes it not suitable for children but nothing gratuitous there are no fbombs dropped around and there is no unnecessary nudity its set in a merciless deranged and dangerous world where violence is the only way of dominance    the story kicks off with a brief introduction on how the world became the way it is followed by an unnecessary voiceover narration from our dear max we then find him all by himself in the desert with his interceptor and pretty soon hes chased down by a gang driving all kinds of crazy vehicles max is captured and tortured and is used as a blood bank because he happens to have a universal blood type its not explained how the gang figured that out but that doesnt matter hes held captive in the lair of the leader of this new world immortan joe pretty badass name for a bad guy who leads an army of men covered in white paint referred to as war boys they are controlled by immortan joe who is viewed by them as some kind of holy being that will liberate them and take them to the gates of valhalla they are willing to sacrifice their lives for him at any moment and all he has to do is give them a look for approval hes like a messed up version of a messiah living atop a rocky mountain in his citadel with a skull shape carved out of it    then there are other people inhabiting this place who are not soldiers but probably people who are ruled by immortan joe amputees famine stricken diseased rotten decaying pieces of flesh looking up to immortan as their god since immortan has control of everything in this world including water he generously furnishes them with it from a waterfall that comes out of holes from the skull he warns them not to get addicted to the water as it will consume them so he only provides a small dose which isnt even enough to quench half of the populations thirst he then sends his trusted imperator furiosa to go to a location to fetch some oil along with some of his men everything seems business as usual until furiosa changes gears and diverts from her task immortan quickly becomes suspicious and pretty soon discovers that she has just stolen his most valuable property 5 women more like 5 hot models who are used as nothing more than breeders that will produce his babies to become one of his war boys in the future engaged he leads his entire army and chases after furiorsa to retrieve his property and he brings along his best guitar playerband too while on the chase the guy sure knows how to handle his pr image and so it sets up a chase that will become the entire movie and along the way max and furiosas paths cross and soon they will have to rely on each other to survive and get through this    the movie takes its slow ass time to get going introducing us to this strange world briefly touching upon ideas that have potential to be explored in future sequels there are various facets of this world that hints at an intriguing universe that is ripe for expansion ideas that are only touched upon lightly but can certainly be taken further i loved the fact that george miller did not go overboard and explain the shit out of this world through your average hollywood exposition dialogue he just lets the imagery do the talking and give you an idea of what kind of mad world he has created and gives you an indication of how deep this world can go just by showing us a couple of shots here and there its enough to grasp the universe miller seems to be aiming for and its going to be exciting to see how far he takes us in the planned sequels should this movie kill at the box office    its obvious that he had ideas for his mad max universe from the very beginning which he wasnt able to showcase in the previous films due to the limitations of the budget and instead was forced to focus on a small part of this world but here he finally seems to have the power and freedom to fully lay out the mad max mythology that he was not able to do in the past and boy what a crazy insane fiery mad bonkers bat shit fucking crazy world it is going to be he finally gets the chance to go deep into the mad max mythos with the free reign and huge budget hes been given here its as if he set out to make the road warrior 1981 all over again but this time the way he had always intended to the result is a relentless breathless breathtaking gripping riveting edge of your seat and awe inspiring work of action and postapocalypse cinema from beginning to the last frame    im in awe as how near perfect the action sequencesstunts were in this movie i mean none of that shakycam horse shit no fast incomprehensible editing no blurry out of focus shit its just pure simple clear straightforward and cleanly shot action picture filled with mad energetic raw adrenaline fuelled stunts the kind that used to be in high quantity back in the 80s and 90s everything is so well executed and held together that its pure technical wizardry and movie magic the cgi was obvious where it was used but it was used sparingly to the point that you dont even remember if cgi was even used because 8090 of the stunts were all real practical stunts we have men throwing fireballs at moving vehicles uniquely designed vehicles smashing into other uniquely designed vehicles then blowing up into shits right next to other moving vehicles men dangling from poles while the vehicles are at top speed men throwing long sticks with explosives at the end same men with sticks jump right into moving vehicles and blow up and all kinds of other mind bogglingly insane stuff that goes on before your eyes and it just explodes on the screen its like a cirque du soleil show if they ever did a show out in the open desert on top of fast moving vehicles the visuals are stunning and there are shots and images that will stick out as absolute best the cinematography is of the highest calibre the score is heart pounding and thrilling the sets vehicle design costumes make up all add up greatly and serve the story and convincingly create a captivating world    but really it all comes down to the motherfucking stunts i mean wow just wow how the fuck did they manage to full this off and not fuck it up at all the crashing cars and flinging men almost leap out of the screen and smash right into your face how in the frigging world did a director well into his 70s managed to recapture the kind of raw kinetic mad energy that he infused in road warrior 1981 and pump it in this movie and still pull it off after 30 years this dude hasnt made a proper action movie in 30 years since his last visit to the mad max series thats fucking incredible in my book its like miller has lost none of his touch as a director i mean how many 70yearold action directors are out there any way and how many of them are able to make a near flawless action picture that tops anything that has ever come before in a few years action aficionados and critics alike will draw a line where there were action movies before fury road 2015 and after fury road 2015 this guy has taken action and blockbuster moviemaking to a whole new level it makes all these other action movies like look like childs play heck why are they even making their cgi laden action movies anyway they should all pack up and leave quit for good and only come back after theyve seen this movie 100 times and learned something from it george miller just made all the young action filmmakers out there look like a bunch of film school enthusiasts and to think that this guy started off as a medical student and then made the very first mad max 1979 and now this after 30 years holy shit this film makes furious 7 2015 look like a bunch of kids playing around with hot wheels toys i mean the action and stunts keep getting crazier better more out of this world as the film progresses and then comes the jaw dropping final climatic chase which just takes this to a whole another level and it all holds together perfectly never once falling apart whenever it came to the stunts and the editing is just oscarguaranteed stuff    at times it did felt like it wasnt enough something felt lacking it left me wanting more it did drag a bit and the chase started to feel a little repetitive maybe because ive been watching all the trailersclipstv spots of this movie over and over obsessively because beware all of the major action set pieces of the movie are already shown in the trailers most of them from the first half of the movie alone but that is not to say it doesnt have a few surprises and twists up its sleeve there are plenty but i just wished i didnt watch any of those clipstv spots so many times that when it came to watching the stunts on the big screen it didnt felt so familiar but it wont get in the way of the full experience for most moviegoers this is just me nitpicking      and of course there is the whole feminist propaganda bullshit that a bunch of guys are perpetuating in their blogs dont buy into that shit this movie features strong women that are not helpless or needy i mean they dont rely on max to help them or see him as their hero and saviour these women are tough they can defend themselves when they need to and they are not about to submit themselves to this male dominated world its a mans world and these women are nothing but their property these women are trying to break free from that and seek independence and i guess thats what miller was trying to show a metaphor for feminism but not in a way your average feminazis would force upon you this is feminism in its purest form we have fiercely independent women who are just as capable as the fierce men in this movie theres an equality an understanding between max and these women and that makes this film all the more brilliant because despite being a 2 hour long chase movie it manages to sneak in all these little details and subtleties and yet they never become overbearing or overshadow the movie its woven beautifully into the proceedings and thats simply worth commending it isnt just another blockbuster or all about the stunts theres more to it than meets the eye its all in the details and if you look closely theres a lot thats being conveyed in between the chases during the breaks and pauses its also an allegory like miller describes a western that has gone completely mad the plot may be minimalistic which works in its favour and the characters may not be fully developed they are however not forgettable they are unique characters that inhabit a strange and offbeat world they stick with you in the end you do want them to succeed and sometimes thats enough as far as character development is concerned in blockbusters especially like this one    if there were worries that furiosa overshadows max worry not sure furiosa is front and center and max is more like a supporting character but this was more like a reintroduction to a new max and by the end of it max takes over the movie so you can rest assured this is very much a mad max movie he is after all surrounded by women who arent just looking to him for help in fact they give him a run for his money i liked the dynamics between furiosa and max their uneasy truce and their mutual respect for each other by the end of the movie make their relationship an interesting one it makes their characters a lot more intriguing and id love to see more of furiosa as much as this new max in the future sequels but yea this movie could easily have been called furiosa and mad max i like how one reviewer describes max in this movie as some nameless drifter who simply took upon the name and legend of the original max and i like that idea one can imagine the original max being dead and we are just seeing these new characters as people who inhabit his world and this new man with no name is now carrying the legend of max upon him in the same universe its a clever way to tie this new rebootsequel with the original films and it enriches the mad max mythos    performances are all rock solid and since shes almost like the main character here charlize theron is striking and carries this movie with her strong performance her character is probably the first original strong independent female character in a blockbuster action movie since maybe linda hamiltons sarah connor shes up there with ripley and sarah connor and she is bound to become an iconic character charlize theron commands the screen and even overshadows tom hardys silent max for majority of the film until hardys max takes over and regains his title towards the end mel gibson may be the ultimate max for me and for most of the fans out there tom hardy creates his own version successfully the rest of the supporting cast especially the modelsactresses playing the 5 wives was also solid they werent just helpless women but were rather active in the story and helped our duo in many ways nicholas hoult as nux one of the war boys who betrays immortan joes clan and tags along with furiosas group is endearing      if this movie doesnt set a new standard for blockbuster cinema i dont know what will i mean if this film does not click with the audience and flops that means its not the filmmakers fault its the audience that will spell the end of innovating original fresh daring bold blockbusters like these which are already impossible to make in this day and age to say this is the movie of the year would be an understatement its quite simply a stunning work of art filled with impressionistic visual splendour that stuns you from beginning to end george miller proves why hes a master filmmaker when it comes to staging epic stunts and of course chase sequences and it wouldnt be an overestimation if i deem fury road 2015 superior to road warrior 1981 and as the best of the mad max series this one takes the cake for being the must watch movie of the year one that demands to be seen only on the biggest imax screen you can find for once the hype and the reviews more than lived up to expectations action and blockbuster cinema simply does not get better than this the bar has been set very high    a
May 15 2015,positive,first off max mad fury road is a sequel and not a remake theres a few implications in the movie that proves this this film doesnt just revolve around max but the effects on other people around him just like the last 2 if you havent seen the first 3 dont bother watching this first great film deserves a high rating
May 15 2015,positive,mad max fury road should go down in the history books as a textbook example of how to revive an genre film franchise its as if george miller went back and studied all of the previous mad max films salvaged only the best parts then reengineered a bigger faster better looking machine from the ground up the results are nothing short of amazing an experience that works simultaneously as both homage for the faithful and imaginative reinvention its a white knuckle ride filled with stunning visuals and driven by an impeccably selected cast this is how its done
May 15 2015,positive,its like a rollercoaster ride  very epic movie  this is the best mad max movie since mad max 2
May 15 2015,positive,for a movie thats essentially one superlong chase scene with pit stops it packs a huge amount of narrative power character arcs are welldefined histories are intriguingly hinted at and the worldbuilding is mindboggling and all this done in the midst of spectacular action sequences but what strikes one the most is how angry it is as if the fury in the title and character named furiosa werent obvious enough  angry at the state of women in a destructive patriarchal society such as the world we live in and that is the reason why this could very well be a gamechanger
May 15 2015,positive,this movie is on full throttle beast mode best of the mad max franchise
May 15 2015,positive,the hype is well deserved mad max fury road was brilliant visceral layered and intelligent
May 15 2015,negative,badbadbadbad had to rate it just to hopefully bring down that insane rt number its at right now very bad
May 15 2015,positive,a new action classic
May 15 2015,positive,absolute insanity loved every second laugh out loud raid 2 meets kingsman violence franchise reborn
May 15 2015,positive,its good  it is almost experimental and artistic in the cinematography and action scenes but you can still tell what is going on  it is straight forward and this is what theaters are for this is a spectacle up there with other recent films like gravity or interstellar           i would be okay if they didnt make a sequel but i admit it would be interesting to explore more of the world
May 15 2015,positive,the best movie of 2015 hands down this movie has set the bar so high
May 15 2015,positive,mad max is a real fun ride it is overrated by the critics but well worth the ticket
May 15 2015,positive,nonstop action great score and killer fucking hot rods
May 15 2015,positive,for weeks the internet has been abuzz about the impending release of george millers new masterpiece there was a lot of expectation going into fury road and miller and crew easily erased any doubt with the movies opening ten minutes it is simply put a spectacular achievement     full love letter  
May 15 2015,positive,nothing short of perfect
May 15 2015,positive,much more than just an action movie
May 15 2015,positive,george miller successfully resurrects the mad max franchise with this beautifully shot richly designed and supremely intense actionthriller
May 15 2015,positive,mad max is almost superfluous  charlize theron pretty much carries the film  it could have been her movie  in a wayit is her movie  she is the focus and proves a woman ca carry an action film
May 15 2015,positive,calling this movie a wild  a crazy ride would be a huge understatement george miller gives his best ever with breathtaking chases  stunts and add the exciting score by junkie xl it gives you the best action movie in recent times mad max fury road is epic fun with the best action sequences of this era
May 15 2015,positive,the gritty throughprovoking action powerhouse roars back to life the magnificent rotten tomatoes ratings are well deserved as the film questions the rationale of our contemporary world system and depicts what may occur if our worst animalistic tendencies are unleashed by resource scarcity the films action sequences are spectacular and together they are a sublime hit for the adrenaline junkie even in the hellish postapocalyptic landscape human decency survives  abet barely
May 15 2015,positive,such amazing film lt is perfect in every way
May 15 2015,positive,unreal loved every second of it
May 15 2015,positive,fanfreakingtastic
May 15 2015,positive,i am not the biggest fan of straight up action films but i loved this movie most of the film is one extended action sequence yet it constantly ups the ante even better is that 90 of the film uses practical effects the mad max films are not known for character development through dialogue instead character development is seen uniquely through action and expression the film is littered with dark humor which aid in capturing the psychotic world of the wasteland prepare yourself for a joy ride
May 15 2015,positive,i thought that this movie was extremely good it wasnt just an explosion every 5 seconds it has a good plot and i loved how the characters developed
May 15 2015,positive,full review on clotureclubcom
May 15 2015,positive,hands down the greatest action movie ive ever seen
May 15 2015,positive,mad max is the newest masterpiece in the infamous mad max movie franchise by george miller who returns after 30 years to direct this movie    evey now and then we have certain movies that become milestones for how great an action film can be 1981 raiders of the lost ark 1988 die hard  1991 terminator 2 judgemtn day 1999 the matrix 2008 the dark knight  and 2015 mad max fury road  this movie is absolutely incredible it is unbelievable it is riveting it is beautifully chaotic and desructive and it is without question the best action movie of the decade no other movie the past 6 years comes close to this masterpiece in terms of practical effects stunt work visual effects sound editing cinematography directing and minimalistic yet effective storytelling and qorldbuilding everything you need to know about its characters is told through actions and decisions over heavy handed exposition the pacing is something out of this world being so extremely super crazy yet so super awesome at the same time while the story is nothing complez it is still there and serves its purpose rightfully without any forced scenery or visual pleasure
May 15 2015,positive,amazing action movie glad to see this franchise back
May 15 2015,positive,high octane thrill ride doesnt quite cut it petal to the metal unrelenting savage and strangely beautiful these are all words and phrases that fail to describe the death metal opera that is fury road believe the hype
May 15 2015,positive,a stonecold action classic the most wild and exhilarating blockbuster ive seen in years george miller is an absolute madman and i cant believe half of what he accomplished with this film the man is 70 and yet theres an energy here that shames many blockbuster filmmakers a third his age it might have been 30 years since the last mad max movie but miller hasnt lost his touch in any way  if anything hes grown as this feels like his opus and the fact a hundred stuntmen didnt die while making it blows my mind cant wait to see it again
May 15 2015,positive,thoroughly enjoyed this reboot it stayed true to the roots of the originals the story was decent and the action sequences were amazing
May 15 2015,negative,dont need to see it people in cleveland tn already drive like mad max
May 15 2015,positive,one of the best movies out this year i was entertained all the way through the movie the music throughout was incredible and it felt like that time in between sequels was never lost a must see for those who are fans of the mad max series
May 15 2015,positive,you have to see this in 3d this movie has all the speed costumes and thrills of the originals must see this one will win many oscars
May 15 2015,positive,it was a great action movie because the scenes looked real and plausible instead of the cheesy cgi and implausible fight scenes that occurs in most of the other action movies   you feel the characters all are suffering from ptsd and searching for a brighter future
May 15 2015,positive,what a lovely day indeed 
May 15 2015,positive,mad max fury road is exhilarating engrossing but most of all  convincing this postapocalyptic world is so masterfully translated to screen that for as overthetop as almost every action sequence is nothing felt out of place i believed in this world its inhabitants and their plightsmotivations and it made the frantic pace seem natural and necessary
May 15 2015,positive,rather linear and not quite the reboot i was expecting would recommend for fans of this genre but i wouldnt pay to watch again
May 15 2015,positive,better than any of the three vintage mad max outings the action and special effects were great tom hardy was ideal for max and charlize theron surprised me in this role which is so far from her usual type nicholas hoult played a very endearingly naive war boy named nux who had the guts to change his whole way of thinking half way through the film
May 15 2015,positive,whatamadlyexhilaratingride highly recommended 
May 15 2015,positive,edge of my seat for the entire thing brilliant
May 15 2015,positive,a very unique action movie it stands out from the mainstream action we see these days the movie is a real blast very entertaining despite the lack of storyline
May 15 2015,positive,good crazy fun but somewhere in the distance you hear the echos of waterworld
May 15 2015,positive,fast  furious marvel stallone take note on how to make a real action movie
May 15 2015,negative,i was never a fan of mad max  this one is no exception  all the bells and whistles are there visually interesting good soundtrack  but all they did was drive in a circle through the desert so that charlize theron could become queen of the weirdos  im sorry but i just dont get it  loud obnoxious and borring things just dont do it for me  98  really people  if this is what passes for good now then i really should just give up on life  disappointed
May 15 2015,negative,great action and if i was 13 this would be the best movie ever  absolutely no plot and any thing that resembles a plot makes no sense  i would never ruin a movie for anyone but there are so many holes in this it is not only beyond thunderdome it is beyond anything remotely plausible  you cannot call a movie mad max when that character is a nonissue in the whole movie ask someone who saw it what was their favorite part  answer when they blew up something   nothing else happens
May 15 2015,neutral,disappointing nothing more than a series of over the top car chases none of the suspense i felt watching the road warrior it was more like the silly characters in beyond thunderdome taken to the next level weak why even hire tom and charlize if your not going to use them no character development
May 15 2015,positive,mad max fury road is a nonstop exhilaration ride the action is outstanding that its fresh and you will likely not see this type of action anywhere else the vehicles are outradous and just how everyone looks is insane this film isnt for everyone and some may be confused by a few things the whole movie is just a ridiculous ride that everything it offers is bizzare
May 15 2015,positive,really fast pace doesnt really explain one thing but vaguely
May 15 2015,positive,terrific action film with some great stunt work and impressive visuals  kept the pace up for the entire film the storyline is pretty slim but its really a giant chasesurvival film in the post apocalyptic world this is a sequel rather than a reboot even with a different actor as the events of the original films are still assumed to have happened sometime in the distant past
May 15 2015,positive,annoying tv ads will tell you that their movies are nonstop action this one is pretty accurate in that regard yet they still manage to do some character and world building definitely meant to be seen on the big screen
May 15 2015,positive,go see this movie you wont have another action movie watching experience like this period
May 15 2015,positive,best action movie in a long time
May 15 2015,positive,practical effects save the day
May 15 2015,positive,this movie is absolute perfection      it is a mindblowing metal mayhem a symphony of destruction that is hard to describe because i have never seen anything like it a facemelting ballet of horsepower and violence yet that is surprisingly feminist        fury road  is essentially a chase movie from start to end but one that will be the standard that the genre will be judged against for years to come the cinematics are phenomenal it all fits together seamlessly all this madness makes sense there is nothing forced here no scene is fortuitous or thrown in because it looks cool  and the storytelling is shown rather then told to you miller respects our intelligence and lets us fill in the blanks theron is the star of this movie the heart inside a steel engine that fuels it all        you can feel the rust taste the dirt smell the diesel fuel and hear the burning rubber think postapocalyptic steampunk or if you can imagine a slipknot concert being held a burningman and the fans of both mixing perfectly then you have an idea of the style george miller pulls off fabulously        oh and it has a flaming guitar   a guitar that shoots flames
May 15 2015,positive,unreal movie 100 recommend to everyone brilliant
May 15 2015,positive,best action movie ina long long time
May 15 2015,positive,a flat out masterpiece of action it reminds us that the genre can be viewed as art and not just a spectacle
May 15 2015,negative,so disappointed it felt like i was watching the action scene outtakes from the original movies but without a storyline
May 15 2015,positive,a non stop ride if you like action movies then this film was created for you
May 15 2015,positive,nonstop action throughout the movie just what i was expecting to see
May 15 2015,positive,this was the best action movie i have seen to date most action films can focus more on the drama but this was pumping with explosions and cars flipping
May 15 2015,positive,one of the best and most insane action movies ive ever seen so much fun remember to breathe
May 15 2015,negative,my best explanation of this movie is water world but in the desert there were some moments where i was like ooo thats awesome but to be honest they were few and far in between not my favorite movie
May 15 2015,positive,picture the worst jungian nightmare combined with circ du soleil in a paint mixer and you have this movie what a thrill ride tons fun
May 15 2015,positive,ok so to start off i forgotdidnt watch the movies from the 80s i was  7 or 8 this 2015 version was insane to say the least it reminds me of twisted metal video game meets water world meets california love tupac was playing in my head the whole time the movie has tons of action and zero plot i was confused on what was going on and for why cinematography was great i love the rock sound trackbut thats about it ill have to watch the originals now
May 15 2015,positive,what a lovely day   oh yeah what a lovely day indeed mad max fury road is a film that kicks so much ass the amount of action in this is something special on its own george millers action metal opus is one of the greatest action films ever made visually appealing kickass performances charlize theron stands out and a script that adds depth to the overall story mad max fury road is a modern masterpiece
May 15 2015,positive,george miller outdid himself with his fourth installment of the mad max series  the action is so amazingly well crafted that i partly am still asking myself how they pulled it off we have only very little cgi effects too and only when they are really necessary  the two main lead actors are equally amazing and pull their characters off perfectly  this movie is a masterpiece of action and we will probably wont see anything quite like it again at least in the next decade
May 15 2015,positive,this movie was insane it was a total trip to watch all the way through the world created hereor brought back here is so alive despite its opposite depiction on film it was beautiful the scenery the whole look of the film was perfect   the stunts mostly done the old fashioned way were totally nuts and fun to watch   mad max himself tom hardy was fine but not the best character charlize therons furiosa takes that spot she kicked ass   this is easily the best action movie ive seen in years totally deserves all the recognition
May 15 2015,positive,totally epic guaranteed to watch it more than once at the cinema
May 15 2015,positive,this non stop action movie is a worthwhile reboot to the mad max franchise after a 30 year old absence tom hardy is an excellent max while charlize theron shows she can hold her own in this high octane fare
May 15 2015,negative,mindnumbing overrated   fury road is a grotesque dustbowl carnage sustained by the ecstatic theological riff to valhalla  beyond that this films succinct and albeit original narrative has little else to say
May 15 2015,negative,i was really excited to see this remake andhuge let down  there are a lot of moments where i actually wanted to say wtf  we have no water in this land but an abundance of speakers car parts and electric guitars  i thought it was cheesy  yes i know the shooting style and audio is meant to be this way but it felt over the top  wait for redbox
May 15 2015,positive,nonstop action simple story line visually stunning all combine for a great movie
May 15 2015,positive,if the word overkill was a baby george miller would be its father
May 15 2015,positive,mad max fury road is extremely entertaining you cant help but sit back and watch this gorgeous spectacle unfold before your eyes
May 15 2015,positive,mad max fury road is a firerocketed shuttle barreling through an expanse of stormy brooding madness emptied by an apocalypse and harvested into death by tyrants like immortan joe a resurrected toecutter tom hardys 90insane 90broken max stumbles into the 100insanebroken world before pairing up with charlize therons furiously fearless furiosa to regain his footing and driving and become the mad max whos been boiling for three movies the film thoroughly constructs a hellborn society existing in the barren earth and rewards the audience with incredible references and callbacks to the first three mad max installments mad max fury road transports the audience through time and space to ground them in the wasteland and solidifies the necessity of theatergoing while doing so
May 15 2015,positive,two hour car chase awesome
May 15 2015,positive,would there be any anticipation for george millers new movie if it didnt have mad max in its title in our current universe it is more than understandable why a filmmaker would want to link a movie like mad max fury road expensive to make at 150000000  though not nearly as expensive as avengers age of ultron at 250000000  and market to a proven property like mad max even if that series is 30 years old has it really been that long  simply calling the film barren postapocalyptic wasteland wouldnt quite cut it the titular character had his origin in the eponymous 1979 movie also by miller that launched what until now had been a trilogy with mad max 2 the road warrior and mad max beyond thunderdome following in 1981 and 1985 with a new actor  tom hardy locke always good  in the lead role replacing mel gibson and a plot that is only tangentially related to the original series  though the aesthetics are very similar  it can often feel like a stretch to find continuity between this new film and its predecessors fortunately i fairly quickly gave up trying and decided to just sit back and enjoy the show    wow what a show it is from the opening precredit sequence to the films redemptive conclusion with a few very brief exceptions the action never stops rarely have i seen such a hyperactive kinetic film and unlike avengers age of ultron and its cgiladen brethren this movie features stunts and explosions that happen on camera lending a particularly palpable power to each and every punch beautifully choreographed expertly photographed and productiondesigned in exquisite detail mad max fury road is a masterful collection of set pieces held together by a mostly wellcrafted script that moves quickly enough to leap over what gaping plot potholes there are its a summer movie such as we havent seen since  the second mad max film considered until now the best in the series and my advice is to avoid my problem of trying to figure out how the movie fits in with the other three and to let it entertain you on its own terms as miller himself has said its a revisiting of the world he created all those years ago call it a reboot call it what you will so continuity is not the point so be it    we meet max as a lone figure against a desert backdrop see poster above telling us in voiceover how the world as we know it ended hes troubled by quickcut visions of his past which seem to link him to the first mad max film and are the least effective parts of the film for me but before he can dwell on his pain hes attacked and captured and then he escapes and then he is captured again wham bam ouch we soon find ourselves in a medieval community whats past is prologue  ruled by a dysfunctional family where water is scarce and prisoners like max are used as blood bags to revive injured warriors max is assigned to one such warrior nux  a fine nicholas hoult warm bodies  and is soon strapped to the front of a soupedup dune buggy as nux and his war boy pals charge out into the wasteland in pursuit of a commander gone rogue that leader furiosa  charlize theron young adult tough and rough as sand  has stolen some precious cargo from the communitys sclerotic but still dangerous leader and this act of rebellion becomes the macguffin that drives pun intended the plot which is really one big car and truck chase scene across the namibian desert    ill be honest i couldnt keep most of the character names straight other than max furiosa and nux but i didnt care leave that to the movie geeks wait im a movie geek  i was along for the ride and though some of the story is confusing the general meaning of the film resonated even in the middle of total destruction there is never reason for despair if we fight back against the evils of tyranny and reclaim our humanity powerful stuff that didnt need to be underlined doubleunderlined in some cases with the few operatic moments of raw plaintive emotion we see when the action briefly stops mad max fury road is not a perfect movie and as much as i like hardy i actually really missed gibson but its a damn good one and great popcorn fare to return to my initial question about franchises heres my answer in a world of oftengeneric blockbuster sameness if one is going to reconceive a franchise this is the way to do it dont remake it dont even reboot it from scratch as in the amazing spiderman as much as i enjoyed that film revisit the world and tell a different story within it blending the old with the new past may be prologue but it doesnt have to repeat itself and mad max fury road is both an homage and an original piece of work and well worth watching especially in a theater go see it
May 15 2015,positive,mad max fury road is absolutely positively extraordinarily phenomenal see it by all means even if you havent seen the mad max movies you can still see this one its more of a reboot than a sequel and its 2 hours of nonstop adrenalinefilled magnificent action so amazing gorgeously filmed badass spectacular i love this movie
May 15 2015,positive,bloody amazing film was truely transported for the entire features duration the most flawless cinematic experience for a long long time see it but dont forget to breath while watching
May 15 2015,positive,visually stunning and thoroughly entertaining   george miller positions charlize theron at the center of this adrenaline pumping ballet  hardy is regulated to a supporting role yet manages to pay homage to the original max  this movie should have been titled mad maxine
May 15 2015,positive,after the disappointment of beyond thunder dome as a kid i sat and enjoyed an epic display off full throttle balls out action filled with larger than life steampunk characters everything mad max 3 should have been well worth the wait of 30 years  tom hardy does a good job of filling gibsons boots
May 15 2015,positive,very average max was presented as a minor character with very little presence conventional story line however great cast effects and automobile pursuit and combat
May 15 2015,positive,awesome adrenaline ride from start to finish great movie 
May 15 2015,negative,while i admit i havent yet seen the other mad max movies i was still excited to see this movie when the reviews came out people were calling it the best action movie of the decade a milestone and many other things did i completely miss something or did i watch the same movie cause mad max fury road was absolute garbage problems with the film first off the movie is called mad max fury road but i found max to be the most boring character in the entire movie i think tom hardy is a fine actor but he was an absolute bore in the role and his only purpose was just a driver and a protector of charlize theron and the three queens theron on the other hand takes up more screen time than hardy does which i wouldnt have minded had they made her character interesting the only character that i liked was nicholas hoult as lux who actually had somewhat of a character arc and thats my main problem with the movie theres no story movies like raiders of the lost ark aliens die hard t2 the matrix and the dark knight are all considered milestones in the action genre because of not only their amazing action but theyre amazing stories and characters that drive the plot mad max fury road does have some impressive action but it takes up 95 of the movie and with very little story and characters i could care less about to the point where it gets old and tedious if you like this movie then i totally understand why its just not for everyone including myself
May 15 2015,positive,just wtf was that even   i enjoyed myself thats for surebut what even was that    i just kept turning to my girlfriend with a confused lookas to why whatever was happening was even happening
May 15 2015,positive,as a part of distinguished postapocalypticsolarpunk genre defining franchise fury road successfully manages to expand its predecessors universe adding an expansive layer of world building with elaborate costumes crazy vehicles imaginative sets and full throttle daredevil actions its like watching a high octane deranged version of cirque du soleil moreover in these times of cgi saturated movies pure stunts and vehicle acrobatics are breath or should i say explosion of fresh air move aside michael bay this is how you do explosions
May 15 2015,positive,pure high octane bat shit insane  adrenaline
May 15 2015,positive,great action packed movie imo the best one so far this year
May 15 2015,positive,fun entertaining movie  great reboot kept the originality and improved every aspect of the story and effects
May 15 2015,positive,wow what an adrenaline rush fantastic stunts and one massive car chase from start to finish that i havent seen the likes of since mad max 2
May 15 2015,negative,hate it is so stressful no dialogue no plot no sense left the theater thank god got my money reimburse
May 15 2015,positive,its not just good its crazy full throttle insanity good
May 15 2015,positive,a masterpiece with some of the best action scenes ive ever seen relying more on practical effects to achieve this it is a non stop thrill ride great performances throughout with charlize theron and nicholas hoult being the standouts of the bunch tom hardy plays a great max and is able to carry his own for this character this is another great film to start off the summer and i highly recommend it
May 15 2015,positive,film of the year rock lml
May 15 2015,positive,the most creative action movie ive ever seen
May 15 2015,positive,great film has me interested enjoyed allot
May 15 2015,positive,ripper 2hr car chase flick was awesome go and see it
May 15 2015,positive,edge of your seat ride
May 15 2015,positive,this bizarre sequel has to the most intense and most creative movie when dealing with such a simple setting each scene literally has you thinking howd they come up with up with that some movies or trilogies should not be brought back and a sequel 30 years later is a terrible idea this is not one of those movies the acting is great and the movie is weird unique crazy fun and is exactly what hollywood needed this will no doubt bring a new generation to love mad max
May 15 2015,positive,an action epic 30 years in the making we get all we need from a mad max film minimalist dialogue a bare bones plot a beautifully fleshed out visual world and bonecrunching action this lives up to the reputation of the previous entries and completely exceeds all lofty expectations do yourself a favor and see it on the big screen
May 15 2015,positive,mad max was  one crazy awesome movie me and my son loved it
May 15 2015,positive,one of the best action movies that you will ever see in your life simply amazing wow
May 15 2015,positive,thats how movies should be made incredible ride well done
May 15 2015,positive,insanely crafted so far the best movie of 2015
May 15 2015,negative,great action charlize was awesome and the main character hardy just grunted mostly so annoying but he did say a few more words toward the end not sure if he was right guy for max no charisma like mel had
May 15 2015,positive,so far ive seen avengers age of ultron three times in theaters twice being in imax fury road makes me regret spending so much money on marvels last outing every cent i spent on seeing super heroes destroy evil robots would have been better spent on this epic master class thrill ride easily the best action movie of the year and may actually be one of the best movies thats going to be released this year in general
May 15 2015,positive,this movie is freaking amazing never thought i would like a movie more this years than avengers what a great movie
May 15 2015,positive,after a 30 year wait i was satisfied didnt think it was possible but george miller pulled it off hope it leads to a new trilogy
May 15 2015,positive,fury road is crazy  amazingly perfect i knew it was going to be good from reading the reviews but it was so much better i absolutely love it george miller is a genius
May 15 2015,positive,think i just saw the best big budget scifi action since um terminator 2
May 15 2015,positive,pure thrill with nonstop action artfully crafted so that the viewer feels inside the battle a truly hallmark film for the action film genre with a simple yet deep story and very strong characters it is a true delight to watch and it just might be an perfect film
May 15 2015,positive,in 1979 a bleak and violent film set in a dystopian future was released in australia with a then 23yearold actor named mel columcille gerard gibson as its star we hear that that mel gibson guy did pretty well for himself and his first major film made quite a splash too mad max held the record as the most profitable film in history comparing budget to box office for two decades and spawned sequels in 1982 mad max 2 the road warrior and 1985 mad max beyond thunderdome and 30 years later with mad max fury road r 200  and more are planned the mad max franchise has influenced countless dystopian films inspired directors and musicians and become the basis for video games and entertainment properties as diverse as a wcw ppv event and an episode of rugrats    meanwhile the mad max films themselves have gotten bigger bloodier and bleaker the budget for the second film was ten times that of the first and the budget for the 2015 version was fifteen times that of the 1985 version as the series has progressed the bigger budgets have allowed for more spectacular visual effects more elaborate props and more impressive set pieces as well as more violence and the depiction of a steady decline of the human condition in the postapocalyptic world of mad max but after all is said and done the only question that matters is whether the time and money that has gone into mad max fury road was wellspent  and whether we should be looking forward to the sequels     at the beginning of the fourth entry into the franchise max tom hardy is still trying to survive alone in a world where civilized society has now completely disappeared hes captured by the war boys an army of young men with painted white skin who believe that their power to fight is enhanced by the blood of other strong men the war boys fight for king immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne who rules his corner of the globe by rationing the only water in the region and he preserves his power through complete control of all available vehicles and the gas needed to run them immortan joe keeps everyone in his realm dependent on him for their very survival and he treats the war boys as his own private army whose loyalty he preserves by promising them an afterlife in valhalla if they die fighting for him besides all that selected men are used as blood banks for his warriors and women are used as breeders and sources of milk    in a setting like this it should come as no surprise that a very strong female character is as important to the plot as the title character imperator furiosa charlize theron has escaped the fate of every other female in immortan joes realm by being a tough and smart servant of the king she drives his heavily armored war wagon a vehicle which is designed to carry and protect the gasoline that the war boys help procure from nearby communities furiosa may be considered privileged but she is not happy about her lot in life and she develops a plan to break free from the pack and do some good she turns one of her gas runs into a run for the border if you will furiosa drives her war wagon west toward the place where she was born and stolen away from many years before shes heading to the green place as she calls it but shes also smuggling some of immortan joes most prized possessions in that war wagon when he catches on he pursues her with the help of his regional allies and his own army of war boys one of which is the especially devoted nux nicholas hoult who has max chained to the front of his vehicle and connected to him by a rubber tube making max into a personal portable blood bank things dont go according to plan for anyone involved and there are multiple violent confrontations among the main characters as they crisscross this vast wasteland in a deadly game of cat and mouse    mad max fury road creates a world that can be as upsetting as it is fascinating this film is something of an assault on the senses but is a truly engaging experience the action is virtually nonstop while the various design elements and the cinematography are truly remarkable frenetic action and explosions of color are occasionally punctuated with an eerie quiet and practically monochromatic scenes which are beautiful in their simplicity the vehicles weapons and clothing that these futuristic communities have cobbled together from the remains of civilized societys industrial production are both frightening and fascinating to behold and the characters personalities are just as colorful its very clear that max has his issues but almost everyone he encounters is madder than he is at times this film is almost too much to take in as it goes somewhat over the top with its action sequences and for lack of a better word with its freakiness but there is no denying that director and cowriter george miller the man who cowrote and directed or codirected all three previous mad max films has brought to the modern screen a unique coherent and engaging postapocalyptic vision which will remain in your head long after you leave the movie theater b
May 15 2015,positive,this movie is a visual spectacle it knows what it is and geroge miller executed it perfectly
May 15 2015,neutral,what can i say  great swashbucklery
May 15 2015,positive,the australian  action thriller movie  mad max  fury road   2015  directed  produced and cowritten by george miller is an amazing moviethough not a follower of mad max series  i found it pretty impressive and i regret for not seeing the prequels      the film shows a post apocalyptic era in australia which is ruled by a ruthless terrorist immortan joe and his armies called  war boys the film starts with the capturing of the leading character max  tom hardy  by war boysimperiator furiosa  charlize theron  drives a war rig with the wives of immortan joe to a place called  green place  defying immortan joes rulesthese wives were captured by immortan joe for breeding his successorsimmortan joe along with the help of motor biker gang and a gang from bullet farm chases furiosa and companythe film is all about their journey through the road in search of green place where they thought could live with out any harm      the actors did a very good job in the stunt sequences especially those who acted as war boys the whole cast did justice to their respective roles in this full length action movie      direction is top notchthe all rounder george miller who handled the script  production and direction needs a huge lauds of applausethere arent any words left to praise the vfx departmentthey did a wonderful jobcostumes and cinematography were nice i liked the original score which included heavily distorted and powerful heavy metal music      this dystopian movie is a must watch one with no doubtif you miss this one you are going to miss one of the best dystopian action movies of this erai am sure you wont regret this full length two action packed hours in 3d      my rating  45    
May 15 2015,positive,mind blowing action scenes
May 15 2015,positive,a simple action packed blood rush
May 15 2015,positive,how to describe fury road an adrenaline soaked high octane throwback to the 1980s action genre which prides style over textual substance physical effects over computer generated imagery for the most part and a pulse pounding soundtrack there are also some truly breathtaking visuals that conjure up some very interesting subtextual themes and arguments
May 15 2015,positive,wow this movie was really good as others have said the fight scenes are awesome i did not know what to expect from this movie there is a plot which i wont say what it is  this movie is crazy i didnt see the original mad max so i cant compare the twojust go check it out
May 15 2015,positive,if your a fan of the series and you take it for what it is an action movie youll probably really enjoy this film
May 15 2015,positive,a spectacular ride from start to finish i left this film knowing that it would one day be an australian classic
May 15 2015,positive,an absolute thrill ride from start to finish the entire film is a chase with some of the best effects and stunts youre likely to see nicholas hoult steals the show for me could have been a bit shorter
May 15 2015,positive,while it is light on story and underuses its protagonist mad max fury road is still an insanely exhilarating and intense film that manages a perfect balance of vigorous action and emotional heft
May 15 2015,positive,george miller has done the impossible hes made a mad max movie as crazy as the first two dont get me started on thunderdome with both a gargantuan budget and alist stars tom hardy charlize theron and nicholas hoult the mad max series isnt for everyone at the screening i went to a pair of customers walked out they wont be the last butif you enjoy kinetic wildly creative action sequences that you cant quite believe even after youve seen them well this is the movie for you there was a time in the 80s when it seemed like george miller might be the next big thing in action movies his career has went in interesting directions babe happy feet but the original road warrior is back showing the kids how it should be done i only wish that mel gibson could have been in the movie somehow still action hasnt been seen like this since 1982 when the road warrior ruled the screen as nicholas hoults nux says what a day what a lovely day
May 15 2015,positive,i havent seen a movie in a long time that got me as pumped as this character design was phenomenal music was exhilarating and the action was well choreographed really though i cant think of anything which i could say was bad in the movie
May 15 2015,positive,the best of george millers mad max franchise that is resuscitate back to life extravagantly bizarre and noisy but totally makes sense mindboggling set design and practical effects to setup a palpable dystopian future
May 15 2015,positive,not just a great action movie but just a great movie in general big explosions well written characters and a well written storyworld make this a perfect entry in the mad max franchise
May 15 2015,positive,very glad to report that mad max fury road is the best movie of 2015 so far wow my least favorite of the series but thats not saying much because i love the previous 3 but damn this movie is great glad to see mad max make such a triumphant return to the big screen after 30 years if youre a fan youre gonna love this film its basically the road warrior but on steroids  george miller hasnt disappointed me with any of the three previous mad max movies and he definitely doesnt disappoint with this one  if you liked the three previous films youll love fury road
May 15 2015,negative,tedious in its myriad of whodoeswhattowho skirmishes poorly chosen leads mumble and pose throughout drowning in feminist bs i hazed out
May 15 2015,positive,its nice to see george miller directing this and not anyone else because he really knows this world good really because he created it so he is really fitting to this project this film is action packed fast paced and exciting its beautifuly shot and has a great soundtrack they blended cgi and practical effects with such ease it seemed that you could not see almost what was cgi and what was not it was also smartly told and didnt play as much on convenience as action movies often do the characters were realistic but wasnt given much dialouge but mostly played with emotions xpressed on characters faces when the characters did talk it didnt sound to realistic but i can see people talking to eachother like that in this world it was filosophical and very well edited everything wasnt great but for the most part it was it was nice to see all these things in this one film and i respect all the effort acting was solid and it was great fun awhile still being smart
May 15 2015,negative,entertaining in the are you not entertained sense but hardly memorable the suspense is lacking when everything is on fire in your face when everything is cranked up to 11 then nothing is special i expected more and now seriously begin to doubt rt scores as a viable metric for accurately predicting my interest in movies
May 15 2015,positive,its a mad mad world and mad is awesome just as the joker wink emoticon  at the age of 70 george miller creates a kick ass movie even most of the young hip directors cant even imagine you thought cars jumping from one building to other was awesome wait till you see this masterpiece ive not seen the original mad max trilogy but turns out you dont need to you wont even be able to breath for the first 15 min or so of the movie
May 15 2015,positive,dont understand whats the hype all about good movie but not great
May 15 2015,positive,for someone who didnt appreciate george millers original trilogy the suspense excitement and realisation of the action scenes are superb there is still a story amidst the nonstop pace and it is dark but excellent performances by charlize theron who steals it from tom hardy provide the meat on the bone definitely looking forward to a sequel already
May 15 2015,positive,it pains me to say this but i think i enjoyed this movie more than the avengers age of ultron i believe this movie to be the higlight of the year so far     never have i seen so much action in a movie but at the same time not lose any of its heart and taint the story in any way ie the expendables or transformers which are great fun and enjoyable spectacles but are just plain stupid its a good 40 minutes before the action finally slows down a bit mad max is able to balance a great story with some of the finest stunts i have ever seen performed on the big screen this is largely in part thanks to a great team behind the scenes obviously but also a great cast charlize theron is the stand out performer with tom hardy being a more than pleasing max but not required to do a great deal     this film has set the benchmark for the year in my opinion and its going to take something special to take its place
May 15 2015,negative,george miller you have sold yourself out you didnt have the balls to make this different to any other big budget hollywood film it could have been directed by anyone there was no story in this film max is a secondary character in his own film tom hardy is woeful as most of the cast are and max is under developed gibsons max was a broken man a nihilist he could be hurt and damaged and had to use he wits to survive as a scavenger hardys is more like the terminator the cgi and stunts are just ridiculous part of making a film is suspension of disbelief of the audience just as judge dredd 1995 tried to do too much in one film this does too and this feels like that film mixed with transformers     miller has pissed all over the universe he created with mel gibson this all highlights mad max 2 as the masterpiece it is you felt that it could be a real world and also the desperation of the time fury road seems like a time of excess where every cool idea a 12 year old boy had has been cramped in place of story
May 15 2015,positive,this new take of the classic film proved to be not only visually stunning but also highly entertaining favorite film of 2015 so far
May 15 2015,positive,beyond beyond thunderdome
May 15 2015,negative,visual effects were the only good thing to be honest the story was crap
May 15 2015,positive,superb film has set the bar for the rest of the year can only think what a lost opportunity it was with george miller not getting to make a justice league movie several years ago
May 15 2015,positive,fury road is by far the best action film i have seen this year  it is nonstop action from start to finish with some breaks to give us some time to breath  its car chase scenes rival all the fast and furious movies combined and its fight scenes push you to the limit of your comfort zone  all of these aspects working on top a very simple plot that gives out a clear message    there is totally nothing that i do not like about this film everything from production design  to costume  to sound effects are just superb  and it did help a lot that i saw it on a 3d imax theatre the visuals were so clear and the sound effects were just earth shattering    tom hardys mad max is more human than the crazy interpretation of mel gibson  charlize theron beautiful even when bald and covered with soot  represents a character that provides the quiet energy that links everyones characters together her subtle interpretation bellies the strength and the determination that she posses to bring forth hope in the land of the hopeless
May 15 2015,positive,what a ride on the edge of my seat from start to finish amazing visuals great music i quite like tom hardy as max charlize theron is brilliant and i already had a soft spot for young nicholas hoult my favourite zombie
May 15 2015,positive,go see it in theaters and with as many friends as you can gather this is the most fun ive had in the theater in a long time     its an 80s movie with the budget it deserves    max is a great interesting character lots of cool butt kicking ladies   not a hard r but still great simple story easy to follow but above all i can tell whats going on take note this is how you do an action movie     im already in line for the next one
May 15 2015,positive,one of best action movie this year
May 15 2015,positive,it is the bomb diggity biches
May 15 2015,negative,without mel gibson this movie sucks never should of been made bring back mel or forget it entirely
May 15 2015,positive,simple  amazing  a must see movie 
May 15 2015,positive,visually stunning a throwback to the 80s action movies less cgi more practical effects
May 15 2015,negative,did you guys accidentally watch the old one
May 15 2015,positive,love every minute of this and would watch it again right now
May 15 2015,positive,wow best action movie ive seen in a real long time
May 15 2015,positive,this is the best movie of 2015 thus far of course george miller has done it again the cinematography is stunning the art direction is phenomenal the score is enthusiastic the entire movie is in sixth gear for all but ten minutes and the action is nonstop just when i thought it was over prepping for the sequel there was thirty more minutes of action badass mustsee
May 15 2015,negative,i am utterly stunned that this has a 99 164  2 as of this writing  there are some good points to the film 1 great production value 2 great visuals 3 good actors    but for me in my humble opinion this is a pretty big miss  this movie brought me no joy    1 90 of this movie is action  action for the sake of action  it cant move the story along as there really is no story    2 charlize therons character is the best part of the movie  not that the character is written well or the motivations really explained  but without that character there is no movie    3 tom hardy is a capable actor  was he in this movie  this has to be the most weakly written lead character in a while    4 to sum up the plot without spoilers  lets go over here now lets go back    overall for the diehard action aficionados this movie should be entertaining  all i can say is that for me this movie was boring and i didnt care about the characters
May 15 2015,positive,oh what a kickass masterpiece  
May 15 2015,positive,gonna learn to play guitar
May 15 2015,positive,the best movie of the year
May 15 2015,negative,mad max fury road  the theme park ride starring tom hardy and charlize therone in their worst performances ever    so let me explain why this movie deserves more criticism than beyond thunderdome in our current time well after the 80s weve developed digital graphics technology to the point where we can display absolutely anything we imagine on screen and while this can enhance a story and project the film makers vision to its maximum potential it can also saturate and overkill anything in the form of thoughtful well crafted and clever cinema story telling    fury road does exactly the latter and while fine for the masses who couldnt care for anything more than a few hours of brainless sugar sop i demand something much better from 30 years of advancement in film making mad max becomes a horrible soulless shade of itself severing any realistic attachment to a man made apocalypse and replacing every other element that gave previous films in the series any thrill with a mindless unrealistic themepark style ride of what we would expect to see if mad max was a disneyland attraction this flamboyant vehicle parade reduces formulas of the previous movies to an ontherails train ride of silly unbelievable characters that touch more on fantasy than the result of a believable apocalypse which produced the colourful characters driven by near insanity and hunger for fuel to keep their nomadic automobile gangs afloat in previous instalments    max himself has also lost any believable depth only suggested with some clever video effects flashing what appears to be his slain daughter among skull faces and zombielike images that hint at his haunting past yet on the surface hes just a cliche of his former self  a man of few words that grunts and groans on cue then goes off course while in the face of danger with a tongue in cheek hey thats my head and then refuses to share his name which seems more like a forced attempt to project some cool and mysterious man rather than a wastelandhardened lonewolf whos deeply scarred by his tragic past once a mortal man who could be wounded scarred and battered to near death our new max resembles a bulky action figure with super human abilities rather than the broken man who survived on wit cunning and his driving skills to outsmart his guzoline guzzling opponents coming from and viewing the movie from down unda tom hardys brand of australia accent is at times so obviously off the mark that id rather him not have bothered at all i felt as though robert downey jrs piss take impression is far better in the fact that it at least contains all the correct twangs and inflections all of the time charlize therone is a nononsense hardass survival woman of good intentions with an american accent exactly as you gathered from the trailer and for all intents and purposes  just as boring as youd imagined    this is what happens when directors go mad with riches and budget the problems used to solve lack of funding in earlier projects can result in better creativity and realism now anything can be put to screen it loses touch with reality and the more discerning moviegoer and then all you have is something for your eyes which matches the crap youre buying at the snack bar all the subtleties nuances and coolness of the previous films have gone and if you come from the same era that i did where such movies as mad max began and film narrative was allowed to mirror social political and environmental degradation you can see we have a movie that does no justice to its original themes whatsoever and has just devolved into a pretty fireworks show rather than expand on the mad max universe or dive deeper into the hostile post apocalyptic world that played like a prophecy and gave credit to the audiences intelligence    were now just bombarded with an assault of unrealistic effects stunts and visuals that hold your head to the screen rather than invite you into an interesting concept or story rich adventure that inspires you to ponder the world and predicament of its characters this is a vertical slice of mad max enhanced with computers and effects to make the drooling morons of the world smile for two hours of their lives and take 30 for the pleasure not a thought provoking aggressive piece of film making which leaves you shocked and unsettled by the portrayed collapse of society the freakish characters it gives birth to or the mystery and speculation of the storys wider horizons    this movie doesnt even serve as any redemption for thunderdome which we all love to hate at best it rises up like some post80smovieapocalypse mechanicalgodzilla and squashes all the bgrade clones that were inspired by the original mad max films its possible that im missing the beauty of such outrageous splendour in all its outlandish decadence but i demand more from a film that once presented a thoughtprovoking premise that even as an eleven year old child stood out to me more than just the crazy stunts violence and its range of creepy and colourful characters    seeing fury road on imax in 3d didnt help either i feel like the frame rate needs to be much higher to keep up with the action and effects on screen for what it was all about it all seemed a bit jerky compared to what im used to at home on pc with games that produce lovely visual eye candy too    this movie is just an empty vehicle and costume parade that would better suit a stage show which would provide it with the appropriate circustype medium this carnival deserves the action and chase scenes bored me to the point where i left a half hour before the movie finished also in attempt to maintain a bit of dignity and get home at a more desirable hour so i could get up for work the following morning i have no doubt this movie will appeal to the masses which obviously wont surprise since the world is largely occupied by trained monkeys who only wish to be stimulated enough to forget about their own empty lives for a few hours at a time but for those of us expecting interesting narrative believable characters and circumstances in a post apocalyptic world its not here and has been substituted with lifeless fantasy figures as dense as the madame tussauds wax figures that theyll be just as visually interesting in becoming    in 20 years i havent felt like my time has been wasted so much that i had to walk out of the cinema until last night mad max fury road is an uninteresting superficial spectacle for the sake of it a fuel injected thrill ride you wont care to take again that will quickly settle into the sand and dust in which it takes place in two thumbs down
May 15 2015,positive,predictable story linechaotic action
May 15 2015,positive,best action movie of my generation
May 15 2015,positive,if im gonna die im gonna die historic on a fury road  nux    mad max fury road drove into theaters with furious anticipation due to excellent reviews that we have not seen from a blockbuster movie in a long while a mixture of sadly hearing i like going into movies with no knowledge of critically feedback about those stellar reviews before my viewing of this film and my favorite actor tom hardy playing max my excitement for this film was a bit overwhelming could it live up to the hype    my name is max my world is reduced to a single instinct survive as the world fell it was hard to know who was more crazy me or everyone else this is the spine tingling start to mad max fury road narrated by max tom hardy in a world ran mad by the mad due to a reduction in the worlds oil the thought on the minds of everyone is simplesurvive in a beautifully shot opening which is consistent throughout the movie max is chased down by cult leader king immortan joes hugh keaysbyrne men and imprisoned in there citadel he is used as a blood donor for halflife war crazed nux nicholas hoult who wants to die historic on a fury road while max is locked up imperator furiosa charlize theron is sanctioned to lead a gas run with a convoy towards gas town on the road to gas town furiosa takes a detour and immortan joe discovers that his five wives are out of there chambers and furiosa sets the road she is traveling on a furious course the king in a desperate anger leads a historically wild and large war party to retrieve his property nux wanting to make a name for himself and to impress the immortal sets out to lead the rescue with max chained to himself so he can continue to receive his blood which gives him strength the first of many absolutely breathtaking action scenes ensues between furiosas rig and joes army in a sand storm with tornados and all sorts of lovely natural elements nux drags max into this mad sandstorm in pursuit of furiosas rig and declares it all as a lovely day lovelythis is maybe not the best word to describe the surrounding events for max but for the viewerone of the straight up coolest and jawdropping scenes ever filmed the intensity captured and maintained throughout the movie is sheer brilliance displayed by director george miller the whole film in its most simplistic form is just one big chase scene but the execution and characters make this film so much more the movie throws you right into the story like so few successful movies have but the acting gives these characters such depth hardy hoult and most of all theron are so effective in a movie that is more about the ground breaking stunts and beautifully sadistic film making hardy like in many films doesnt talk very much for a main character but gives a fully expected performance marked by controlled brilliance hoult as nux gives energy and surprising heart to mad max fury road in his quest for hope the theme of hope is rooted in this film nuxs hope began in an attempt to please cult leader joe in battle and ended in a quest to help those he was originally out to kill theron as furiosa was a gem and gave a strong women character that at times stole the show from the titled character passionately ran by redemption furiosa fights for those oppressed by this cruel apocalyptic world    mad max fury road feels like hope in an action genre fueled by cgi and depthless characters it is unlike anything seen before and the intensity is jarring and never lets up george miller creates action scenes that are truly unique and will leave no one yawning hope has arrived not only for the characters in the movie but also for viewers and fans of action films what a refreshing cinematic experience not only because of the visceral action scenes but also the depth of the characters and themes while due to the hype the fourth installment of mad max may not of left me fully satisfied it was pretty dang close even though my expectations were through the roof if you choose to see mad maxfury road it will truly be a lovely day for you and hopefully regain your hope in summer blockbusters     check out more of my reviews at 
May 15 2015,positive,mad by name frigging mental by nature     amazing fight scenes with a bonkers plot great fun but dont expect too much in terms of character and story
May 15 2015,positive,checking this installment out with no doubt  was a mad max fan was a road warrior fan was a tina turner fan even in thunderdome so there you go
May 15 2015,positive,glorious action imagination and mechanical wonders the beauty and craft against the bleakness feels like an absolute masterpiece of an action movie
May 15 2015,positive,what a day what a lovely day indeed
May 15 2015,positive,what a lovely day  its the first time in more than 2 decades ive seen such an intense and mad movie since terminator 2 judgment day 1991  woohooo  must experience at least 2 times more at imax d
May 15 2015,negative,i suspect the studio laid aside a large sum of money to pay off critics around the globe it tricked me thats for sure i saw the trailer and wondered how the 99 tomatometer could possibly be true people will like this movie as people will always flock to the big loud colorful posters but not critics right wrong if you like films about anything beyond a 9year olds imagined hotwheel chase scene then dont bother its a simple movie for simple people another symptom of hollywoods feverish addiction to arbitrary nonsense its stylized and keeps your attention for about 5 minutes before you remember this isnt a rob zombie music video from the 90s and you have another two hours to go
May 15 2015,positive,just phenomenal nonstop edge of your seat exhilarating movie  this puts fast and furious to shame beautifully shot beautifully choreographed gorgeous production design i didnt want it to end
May 15 2015,positive,like the wizard of oz of action fantastical fantastic
May 15 2015,positive,guess im the few that werent totally impressed with the linear storyline it left me wanting its water world in the sand but without the fun parts
May 15 2015,neutral,even though this movie has a laughable plot the action scenes make up for it
May 15 2015,positive,fast and furious meets death race and just a hint of kill bill    having not seen any of the other mad max movies prior to seeing this one i went in with an open mind that mind in question received a thorough beating of nonstop action to the point where it was practically splattered against the wall behind me    so in case you havent already guessed mad max fury road is insane its a level of insanity that i have never seen in an action film before there is not one sane character in this movie and even in its calmer moments its still unapologetically crazy    the movie finds max played by tom hardy kidnapped by a cult who honor a sadistic warlord named immortan joe this guy is fcked up hes basically twisty the clown from american horror story freak show with darth vaders voice and appendages anyway darth twisty runs his own freak show of malnourished warrior boy terrorists i say malnourished because they require constant blood donating from human blood bags max himself becomes a blood bag to nux played maniacally by nicholas hoult but when max manages to escape during a supply run he is thrust into a battle for survival when he teams up with nux and a rogue servant to darth twisty known as imperator furiosa charlize theron together they must travel to the other side of the desert in a steam punk train truck with a cargo full of slave women fated to be darth twistys breeders the rest of the movie consists of one epic action spectacle after another and they are made even more special when you realize they were all filmed using 90 practical effects ive got to hand it to george miller for making these scenes work with almost no cgi whatsoever i could imagine scenes like this being made in the eighties but definitely not at this caliber this movie sets a whole new standard for practical action movies that i dont think anyone thought was possible in the twentyfirst century    the only thing slightly more insane than the movie itself are the performances as i mentioned there is not one character in this movie that i would categorize as sane everyone has their own little perks that make them just as mad if not madder than everyone else tom hardy is pretty much the only actor alive who could take over any role previously played by mel gibson his max is probably the most sane out of everyone but trust me thats not saying much charlize theron could almost be considered the female revision of mad max she practically takes center stage in this movie anyway i wouldnt mind seeing a spinoff or two darth twistys breeder slave women are played by rosie huntington whitely from transformers 3 zoe kravitz from divergent and about three or four other aussie andor british actresses that i neither recognize nor remember their names all i know is that they were equal parts eye candy and strong female characters and i always appreciate that  but the real show stealer here is nicholas hoult as nux hes just crazy theres no sugar coating it he also happens to be the most reasonable crazy person in this movie which is saying a lot for a brainwashed terrorist he manages to bring at least a sliver of humanity into a movie that is fueled by the insane    mad max fury road is without a doubt the most sadist destructive frenetic adrenaline bloodfueled orgy of a movie that i have seen in quite a while and its well worth your time at the theater just watch the trailer so you know what youre getting yourself into beforehand    stars out of five
May 14 2015,positive,it has been nearly 24 hours since i saw fury road and im still trying to recover it is the sort of film you forget to breathe through much like gravity or captain phillips but for an altogether different reason unrelenting from beginning to end this postapocalyptic saga is virtually one long explosive chase sequence albeit one which seemingly has new ideas on tap the action ie the whole film is utterly bonkers conceptually and in execution that writerdirector george miller and his team concocted such ferocious set pieces is impressive enough but being able to pull it off with extraordinarily daring stunt work  augmented by gritty cgi  is simply aweinspiring     visually it is vivid and spectacular the searing desert landscape offering a dirtfilled grime so tangible your throat will dry up within seconds whilst the vehicles are creative and wonderfully preposterous the heartpounding score by junkie xl in which he blends orchestral and heavy metal music accompanies millers on screen splendour to create a visceral experience for both the eyes and the ears the vehicular carnage may be the drawcard but the committed cast elevate the overall product tom hardy is savage as max charlize theron is compelling as imperator furiosa and nicholas hoult is gonzo as nux whilst a plethora of recognisable aussies show up in deranged cameos     theres an intensity here you just dont find in majority of the bigbudgeted blockbusters an inventiveness in all elements that drives this movie from great to mesmerizing miller hasnt played in the mad max world since the dreadful beyond thunderdome back in 1985 but by god he has redeemed himself and then some fury road is a rollicking ride that carves out a piece of cinematic history all for itself in short it is a grungy masterpiece
May 14 2015,positive,the film is an action thriller that leaves nothing and everything to the imagination the film doesnt have much dialog but george miller made every word count it was suspenseful all the way through this was a vision that was perfectly executed mad max was a masterpiece of epic proportions it will go down in history as one of the best films ever made
May 14 2015,positive,this movie is absolutely operatically beautifully batsinthebelfrybonkers completely out of its goddamn mind and i loved every second of it
May 14 2015,negative,a two hour long car chase with lots of explosions there really isnt much more to this movie than that     i feel like the movie could have been so much more if it had less explosions and some well directed violence but even still the acting was pretty bad and the storyline is even worse     i appreciate that its supposed to be a fun movie and nothing more the action scenes are big and epic but theyre all the same the first 15 minutes of the movie is pretty much the same as the 1hr 45 that follows and honestly it was boring as hell
May 14 2015,positive,if youre like me you  you love aggressive movies filled with action violence and carnage see furious 7  if you do not like such movies then stay the fuck away from this one stay farfar away     otherwiserun to see this d    there is not one wasted second in 2 hours where your brain is assaulted with grimy gritty fuelinjected testosteroneloaded turbocharged post apocalyptic mayhem    too much is going on in every direction  people are chased vehicles erupt gunfire blazes limbs fly nightmarish scenes of badassedry brought on by hellish ghouls howling to the drumbeat of violence were talking about guitar flamethrowers i kid you not    oh and throw in a few hot chicks  including zoe kravitz yesss  and you know what  for a bonus lets just make charlize theron a total badazz with a mechanical arm for shits and giggles    tom hardy fills in for  mel gibson as the classic title character and he is truly mad insane in the membrane but to survive in this world you have to be gone off your friggin rocker     this is the world after the apocalypse it is chaos at the brink of disaster barely  held together by a vaderlike fatherfigure who rules thru fear and the promise of water you better have a supedup vehicle and it better be mean and fast and full of spikes and explosives    this is action on an acid trip  2 hours of this shit will either crank you up or hurt your brain either way im going to go see it again d       fury road does exactly what it set out to do and earned every single star of the 5 stars i rate it
May 14 2015,positive,loved the characters the world and the storytelling
May 14 2015,positive,moviemoose mad max  fury road   no spoilerspromise   the return of the dystopian landscape  the return of the raod warrior  tom hardys seamless transition into mel gibsons iconic character is quite amazing he is max rockatansky scavenging the desolate wastes no longer a soldier or vigilante now just a survivor haunted by his past failures  this unsurprisingly high octane action spectacular is a vivid cinematic wet dream  it is as absolutely beautiful to watch as it is terrifying to behold   lush rich warm colours paint a tableau of pure ultraviolence that really has no boundaries nonebut they dont feel like token gestures the film unfolds and these events are borne from what is obviously a truly feral existence therefore they feel natural  this amazing movie is an event not overly blessed with plot but which mad max movie is   the pace is relentless thats no exaggeration it is completley relentless   it puts its pedal to the floor from minute 1 and it does not let up for a second  nicholas hoult is superb charlize theron is superb and hardy in the almost silent brooding anti hero role hardy is likewise  ive never seen an action movie so brutally realistic you feel every thing the pulse pounding soundtrack ingeniously realised on screen is pitch perfect  its a technicolour orgy of blood guts gears  gasoline that is simply glorious  its an audacious vibrant frenzy of adrenaline and excitement that reignites a genre and elevates george miller into a director that studios will lust after  this movie will draw a line in the post apocalyptic desert sand its set in and dare other action flicks to cross it  a very special moviego see it
May 14 2015,positive,this movie just left me slack jawed and wide eyed
May 14 2015,positive,i wasnt sure about the movie at first because it was so different but the more i think about it the more i realise how much of a masterpiece it is they dont shove the entire story in your face like most movies do but give little clues here and there for the viewer to piece together the bigger picture    the character designs are actually the best i have ever seen the concepts and ideas are very creative and quite shocking the new apocalyptic culture is very well thought out and the movie throws you right into the middle of it
May 14 2015,positive,loved it  hardy is a great max
May 14 2015,positive,probably the wildest movie i have ever seen
May 14 2015,positive,mad max is all about the action and thats what makes it great
May 14 2015,positive,i loved it creative as they come
May 14 2015,positive,eq reviews mad max fury road    i could make this review short by summing up the entire review in one wordinsane but seeing as how im a rational human being and like to talk about things that interest me ill get in depth in the fourth installment of this franchise we have tom hardy taking over the title role from mel gibson and he does a damn fine job as the character of max was never a big talker hardy plays the role so subdued with only a handful of dialogue and hand gestures he makes the character work so well the rest of the cast especially charlize theron all bring in great performances with one of the creepiest and awesome villains ive seen in a long time the action is so monumental it almost plays a character itself the film is essentially a 2 hour chase scene that have some over the top sequences that make every action movie fans heart beat out of their chest while the film has a ton of action it does take a few pit stops to remind us that we have actual characters on board with a story and some emotion to go along with this wild ride and it all works and also reminds us that this film isnt necessarily all about max the down time when we get to know about the actual story works and fleshes out just enough of the characters to make you hope that they survive all of the carnage on top of all of that the film looks amazing original trilogy director george miller uses the camera as a paintbrush and made one of the best looking action films ive seen in a long time from the aerial shots to even the color of the film it all works so damn well overall this new addition to the mad max franchise is a welcome return for the crazy character and is so far the best and most entertaining film ive seen this year even over avengersâ  spread the word and see fury road especially if you liked the previous instalments namely the road warrior aka mad max 2  a
May 14 2015,positive,action  so much action   a demolition derby enthusiasts dream  wow

May 14 2015,positive,a visual and insane masterpiece
May 14 2015,positive,you cant hear much but engines and you dont see much  but fire and sand pretty much the whole thingis one long and continuous action scene shot at 60infinity mph     it is very ugly and tragic like real life can be especially in a world where people can literally be enslaved by the concept of being allowed to die yet there is honor embedded in all the madness     hardly anyone talks in this film and almost everyone dies in the most hilariously terrible and gruesome ways possible if someone considers this a spoiler then they havent seen very many mad max films     also its a piece sprinkled with feminism strangely but to me its all very mad maxish the wholly eventual fuck it now i gotta help or else ima total piece of shit thing     dont expect him to beast out all the time though he gets his ass whipped and also gets saved himself a lot but hes not the only gangster sob in the film fooooooor sure     stylewise a modernistic verypostapocalyptic painting that stays etched in your retina with its splashy reds and browns     its insane how genius it is the glitchy yet fastpaced action seems ridiculous at first on the surface but then it starts to feel like a truly awesome liveaction borderlands adaptation film     this movie hooks you in with aesthetics but still fucks with your head and makes you think     extremely welldone and an obvious passionfilm for anyone involved the cast and the director     it literally ended with no one applauding everyone silent then i walked out hopped in my car gunned that bitch up and got it i punched the ceiling of my car as it screeched down the highway and almost hit a deer     i cannot believe how awesome it is and how it grabs you and keeps you in another world even after you leave the theatre     go see it but have no expectations and itll definitely blow you away     he george miller came back and made the best mad max yet     p s there is a gimplike creature shredding a guitarmurderaxe while hanging from bungee chords the entire film  playing eighties shredmetal as its score     not joking but it is hilarious     p p s hardy probably has but what 36 lines in the film but bet your ass he fucking kills it
May 14 2015,positive,the best mad max film ever
May 14 2015,positive,too badass of a movie enough said
May 14 2015,positive,some of the best editing production design costume design and overall everything ive ever seen can i give it 6 stars
May 14 2015,positive,wow this is not a movie this a work of art how did anyone survive the stunts i have never seen a movie with so little plot and so little dialog have such a powerful effect on me this is in every way unmatched by anything i have ever seen before
May 14 2015,positive,amazing cinematography but it was 90 car chase  i would have been perfect if it was 30 minutes shorter but 2 hours of car chase was too much for me
May 14 2015,positive,blood will be shooting out of your eyes by the end in this instant classic while mel gibson brought a more human element to mad max hardy steps in as an equally subdued but almostmute max the chase which ultimately comprises most of the film ranks up there with anything ive ever seen easily besting the first three movies and blowing my clothes off in front of hundreds of theatergoers
May 14 2015,positive,pure chaos is the only way to describe this movie i loved every minute its like twisted metal meets borderlands amazing stunt work and special effects
May 14 2015,positive,well there was very little dialog and lots and lots of action explosions and the song escape by junkie xl tom hardy had 10 lines top and it was fantastic they didnt hold back and once the action started which was about 14 mins in the action stayed til then end i read that one scene took over 130 days so appreciate the art and effort day one theater watch day 1 blu ray hope there is another one soon
May 14 2015,positive,great cinematography story and acting nonstop
May 14 2015,negative,all ive heard is that mad max is so new so fresh providing entertainment not previously seen well if this is the standard there are gonna be a lot of very disappointed viewers out there mad max demonstrates that just like the water and oil in the dystopian future it posits hollywood creativity is all but dried up free from substance free from quality acting but chalked full of explosions and violent carnage mad max is a visual antiseed what is an antiseed in one of the films few fleeting moments of poignancy a character describes bullets as antiseeds plant one and watch something die this i can only imagine is truly the box office destiny of a film as hollow and meaningless as mad max turned out to be
May 14 2015,positive,great nonstop action and stunning cinema photography but the story was a bit nonexistent and max has been reduced to a supporting role
May 14 2015,positive,a great dateline adventure with a unique world that make other movies look like hot garbage compared to it
May 14 2015,positive,this movie was visually incredible the score was amazing and even the plot but what did disappoint me was tom hardy i expecting more from him but overall was a great movie
May 14 2015,negative,what movie were some of you people even watching    i went and believed the hype with the 99 rating at rottentomatoes and now im thinking i should become a professional movie critic what a feminist propaganda piece of crap is right    without giving away any spoilers as it just came out ill put it this way    charlize therons character was as useless as was the character development and script in other words anyone could have played the role but i guess she needed another paycheck for that matter the guy who played max i care so little to even look up his name was a joke himself he was basically a lobotomized version of anything that mel ever was    as for the vehicles in the desert i was laughing the whole time considering i just spent 100 on an oil change filter and labor for my motorcycle today in fact and im watching these people with no resources no green places to grow food but with unlimited gasoline and more importantly spare tires air and oil filters and even oil or spark plugs nice to know that the future apocalypse of the mad max world wasnt done in by an emp or anything and that theres a hidden napa or autozone store along with cheap gas just tucked around every corner    and the funniest part of all of the incredible amazing epic scenes that everyones going on about they have these elaborate weapons and choreographed maneuvers using improvised weapons and guns and grenades leaping onto cars from extended 20 foot poles and yet a truck filled with a gimp 5 supermodels 5 old women a guy who just donated blood and hasnt slept in god knows how long is able to take on over 100150 armed freaks including a rolling heavy metal band because exactly its a movie and a stupid one at that    you dont have to just suspend your belief with this one you need to completely disconnect your brain from caring and realize that we are living in the movie idiocracy as evidenced by many of the reviews ive read so far     im giving this movie a 25 at best
May 14 2015,positive,took me a few minutes to get onboard but after that it was a wild ride george miller packed the best of the old films into this one but what really sets it apart from most action films in the emotion packed into the action he makes you care about the characters and the world
May 14 2015,positive,one of the best action movie ever fully bonkers action filled with infinite adrenaline watch it and get impressed
May 14 2015,positive,if you are a fan of the original you will love this movie
May 14 2015,positive,it leaves you satisfied but wanting more
May 14 2015,positive,an absolute blast of beautiful wasteland and vigorous stunts
May 14 2015,positive,i loved it the director george miller did a fantastic job in this film making the best action movie as he possibly could it had great fight scenes amazing car stunts and chases fun engaging characters and a decent plot tom hardy and charlize theron were awesome in this movie overall its one of my favorite movies of the year so far its a pure adrenaline rush from start to finish
May 14 2015,positive,so far beyond my expectations there was such intense attention to detail with this movie it couldnt have been much better i cant wait for the sequel
May 14 2015,positive,the fact that miller was able to shoehorn progressive messages about female autonomy reproductive rights and income inequality into what is essentially a nonstop car chase is rivaled only by his ability to make said nonstop car chase consistently jawdropping it might be sacrilegious to suggest that the latest edition of mad max is even better than the second installment but when its this goddamn badass it would be nearly impossible for any longtime fan to come to any other conclusion its a feminist masterpiece of an action movie and undeniably one of the best films of 2015 so far with incomprable action sequences and powerful performances from charlize theron and tom hardy the only problem i had with the experience was that it ended
May 14 2015,positive,a wild and fantastic ride
May 14 2015,positive,loved it full of car chase action like the originals than you will love this one
May 14 2015,positive,non stop action i feel like my eyes have been held open for two hours not to miss any of the action one of the best of the genre the movie is unrelenting    some brief nods to previous mad max movies but this largely stands on its own with a great performance by theron
May 14 2015,positive,a fantastic ballstothewall experience that is relentless in its quest to oneup itself scene by scene shot by shot 110 minutes of pure action in a 120 minute film its everything thats great about the first three films multiplied to a power of ten except for the lack of dog
May 14 2015,positive,very intense and fast paced mostly
May 14 2015,positive,saw the premier and wow that was such a awesome movie really is a must see
May 14 2015,positive,the best spectacle this movie provided me was a theater audience that granted it their full undivided desperately tense attention and the movie rewarded us for that many times over
May 14 2015,negative,dont waste your time and money  first of this is not a mad max but a mad she max movie  the dude that playes mad max has hardly any lines  and when he does hes a buffoon   if this is supposed to relaunch the mad max franchise hahahahaha
May 14 2015,positive,rekindled my love and revived my hope for cinema best movie ive seen in theaters in a long time
May 14 2015,positive,do yourself a favor and just watch this action masterpiece
May 14 2015,positive,great action movie and story was not weak im sorry it wasnt all computerized which made it great the story fit well it was the best action movie ive seen this decade plus who needs a  story line for a action movie basically if your not into action then go see bubble gum movies like pitch perfect maybe their  story line will be stronger for the weak    minded
May 14 2015,positive,this movie is beautifully shot edited and choreographed mayhem the dialogue is tight and sparse but the real acting comes from the actions of the characters whether its the silent cooperation between therons furiosa and hardys brilliantly handled turn as the iconic titular character or the gleeful insanity on the face of the war boys its so obvious that this was a passion project of george miller in every aspect of the films design the costumes vehicles and people are grimy and dirty and the explosions are practical and glorious this is action filmmaking at its finest and the only hope is that this movie makes a war rig full of cash to encourage more major studios to take chances on inventive fresh blockbusters
May 14 2015,positive,totally awesome thrill ride from the first second to the last  never lets off the gas and manages to not take itself seriously while still engulfing you in the setting
May 14 2015,positive,this movie is a experience from start to finish not stop action and craziness cannot even put into words  100 go and see it hypeisreal
May 14 2015,positive,with gasoline for blood and 17 cans of red bull up its ass mad max fury road will pump you up with more horsepower and chrome than youll know what to do withand youll love every ounce of it
May 14 2015,positive,amazing movie  very very seldom do i see a remake and think it was better than the original for example total recall blah  but this movie is definitely better than the original  better than avengers  best movie of the year by far
May 14 2015,positive,it is truly an action masterpiece yes some cgi was used and you can tell when it is used however all of the car effects and action effects all seem to be practical     this is a true sequel to the road warrior and i had a blast in the theater george miller was able to keep intensity up for two straight hours and at the same time accomplish a sense of feeling and character development could not recommend this movie enough one of the best action movies i have ever seen
May 14 2015,positive,epic movie gets it from its predecessors george miller is amazing what a lovely day
May 14 2015,negative,mad max fury road suffers from pretty much everything most action movies suffer from lack of character development and a clear narrative
May 14 2015,positive,stunning visuals  fantastic action  wild romp crazy fun  all good things to make you want to see this film  unfortunately thin thin thin on story plot character development  gotta love charlize though  she gave it a go and let herself be the ugly one around the model beauties posing as supporting actors  tom hardy  well always fascinating intriguing yes  but never had enough to work with to get anything going character wise  so a recommend go see you ask yes  fun yes  crazy yes  just keep your expectations moderately in check and youll enjoy the ride  literally
May 14 2015,positive,unique and insane this movie is unlike anything i have seen in years crazy characters and crazy stunts special effects have finally caught up with george millers vision
May 14 2015,positive,old school straight out of the 80s with a modern budget mad max fury road is simply brilliant heres to hoping it is the first in a series
May 14 2015,positive,if you love the mad max trilogy then youll love mad max fury road its actionpacked scenes and memorable characters make this movie a mustwatch
May 14 2015,positive,not a dull moment was to be had with this gorgeously shot film edge of your seat action for two hours straight
May 14 2015,positive,after thirty years of absence director and writer george miller returns his post apocalyptic action franchise to its forgotten glory in afilm tinged with adrenaline and mayhem its impeccable hand crafted art design and phenomenal stunt work spawn exhilarating set piece after set piece to create the action spectacle to be beat not only of the summer but arguably of the last few years charlize therons furiosa steals the show as a hardened one armed woman seeking redemption and revenge
May 14 2015,negative,lets drive across the dessert and back again while blowing stuff up and kicking the shit out of people its cool for the first hour but not two its also bad when my 12 year old brother mid movie says this is really dumb
May 14 2015,positive,some of the most creative and beautiful action scenes ive ever scene every other car chase bows down to this movie every shot in this film was beautifully photographed its mad max so its not a normal movie if you dont know what that means then dont watch it best action film of the year so far
May 14 2015,positive,so mad max i think george miller has gone insane its like he took the best part of the road warrior and make it an entire movie with 100 more wasteland crazy  best movie of the summer with nods to mad max 1 and 2 enough story to get the ball rolling and goes off the rails in the best way possible from there     what i like is that the plot is subtle but still gets the point across a prime example is when tom hardy gives charlize theron the sniper rifle without a word it gets across that he acknowledges that shes a better shot and that they now fully trust each other     no clunky dialog needed the action moves the plot and oh boy does the action move
May 14 2015,positive,awesome they kept it real mad max fans will be proud
May 14 2015,positive,i think i just saw the most beautiful action film of all time  then again i dont know what i saw at all
May 14 2015,positive,an epic of epic proportions  a bit light on story but more than makes up for it everywhere else
May 14 2015,positive,some movies can just prove that gripping storyline is not necessary to keep you engaged the whole 2 hours latest in mad max series is the perfect example it will keep you glued to the screen from start to very end a 100 action movie for all the movie lovers though the movie is titled mad max  charlize theron as furiosa steals the show even in a movie like this where lead actors has not much to perform theron stood out action scenes are tooooooo amazing and should be enjoyed in theatres finally came across a movie after gravity where 3d is having some effect envy those folks who are watching this in imax  dont miss this in theatres 
May 14 2015,positive,this is how you do an action movie it was absolutely oozing with its unique style
May 14 2015,positive,amazing film this is what a blockbuster summer movie should be this was one heck of a movie 5 stars brilliant
May 14 2015,positive,great movie from start to finish
May 14 2015,positive,possibly the greatest action film of alltime
May 14 2015,positive,part nightmarish journey through the abyss of mans animalistic and sadistic psychology of survival and part feminist salvation this is a movie like nothing ive ever seen rarely does a piece of film like this come along or if it has i sure havent seen it entire sequences had me wondering why i chose to watch this while being utterly transfixed at the same time i really had to pee towards the beginning and deciding which point to run out and rush through it was the only moments i wasnt fully engrossed and as i ran up the stairs of the regency at granada hills my adrenaline was shooting me forward with a riptide of mayhem whirling in my brain     you know that feeling when you get on that one roller coaster the one that makes you uneasy as you see it pull up and youre filled with dread rising to the top then as you plummet down and get whipped to and fro and all around the fear and joy become one long blur that is literally impossible to escape thats this movie for two hours its terrifying and exciting and you leave completely out of yourself but i dont necessarily need to ride it again
May 14 2015,positive,mad max is amazing pure adrenalin awesomeness editing is wonderfully coherent for the action scenes really wanna see a how it was made of it theron was fantastic
May 14 2015,positive,incredible george millers masterpiece if you have seen it all this one is for you
May 14 2015,positive,this is a welcome change of pace in the action genre and a movie that succeeds at nonstop action while simultaneously telling a great story
May 14 2015,positive,really worth going to see havent seen any other mad max movie and this was still very good
May 14 2015,positive,an instant classic that rivals the road warrior an intense imagination filled with the best version of the apocalypse smiled ear to ear the entire ride itll be had to dethrone this as my favorite film of 2015 ill be back going to watch fury road 10 more ten more times at the theater
May 14 2015,positive,great bit of work mr miller did there
May 14 2015,positive,definitely one of the best movies of 2015 amazing meaningful action scenes with great performances from the cast
May 14 2015,positive,insanely fun with powerful female characters and enough technology to get most people hot and heavy in their seats surprisingly little plot but somehow it doesnt matter
May 14 2015,positive,a refreshing boost of energy charisma and psychotic fun in the underperforming action genre to the audiences simply looking for a good action film at the movies you really cant do much better than mad max fury road     tom hardy and his opposite lead charlize theron lead a strange but infectiously dynamic cast in this post apocalyptic wasteland where danger action and madness lurks in just about every cornerand nearly every minute of the films running time seriously its possible this film might have just a bit too much action if thats even possible    it might not be everyones cup of tea nor does it have the most original plot in filmmaking pretty basic story but with the uppercut haymaker it delivers on the action front you wont even care i just cant remember the last time i had this much fun at the movies
May 14 2015,negative,i cannot believe this was 99 we saw the movie premier early and the audience was just dead quiet when the movie ended no story line or character development nothing but chase scenes and crazies mad max hardly speaks through the entire movie very disappointing reboot
May 14 2015,positive,awesome awesome awesome thrill ride you could feel so intense excellent escape that will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time
May 14 2015,positive,the definitive action movie of our modern times nothing is gonna come close to this beautiful madness anytime soon
May 14 2015,positive,non stop action from start to finish not really a clear storyline nevertheless george miller manages to keep you wanting more in the fourth installment to the mad max story
May 14 2015,positive,a modern classic that begs to be seenfeltheard
May 14 2015,positive,good action and great visuals in 3d
May 14 2015,positive,mad max is a thrill ride that everyone should see from the stunning visuals and heart pounding adrenaline filled action to the unspoken emotion that the actors portray so well this is one of those movies that comes along once in a lifetime you will be on the edge of your seat the whole time
May 14 2015,positive,pure mayhem thats all i can say
May 14 2015,positive,if six stars were possible this would get itcannot possibly recommend this movie any higher quite literally everyone needs to see it
May 14 2015,positive,i went to see this movie today 51415 at a special 7pm showing the movie was phenomenal and i highly recommend seeing it in 3d if you can
May 14 2015,positive,loud crazy explosive best action movie ive seen in a lonnng time do yourself a favor and make sure you see this in a theater
May 14 2015,positive,perfectly put together piece of movie magic  my only hope is that i forget enough of this movie by the time star wars comes out to give it a fair shake against this masterpiece as my favorite movie of the year
May 14 2015,positive,this movie was mind blowing  the best action movie in 2015  the scenes with the huge   explosions just left you drooling  for more
May 14 2015,positive,easily the best and most accomplished film of 2015 george miller has created a masterpiece that truly transcends the action genre
May 14 2015,positive,this is without a doubt the best action movie ever created
May 14 2015,positive,i actually like this one better than the 3rd onesorry mel gibson  beyond thunderdome sucked  this one brought the chase scenes back and all the chaos and mayhem of the road rage  charlize with one arm was a very surprising move  overall it was a good flick
May 14 2015,positive,beautifully filmed filled with intense white knuckled action  sequences and a great hero that is always challenged a worthy opponent and  strong performances from tom hardy and charlize theron makes mad max fury road one of the best action films of the decade
May 14 2015,positive,wow ahhh mind blowing
May 14 2015,positive,so far 2015 gave us 1 good movie which is furious 7 and one great movie mad max fury road it is one of the best movies i have ever seen an ive seen a lot of movies 100 action that will not let take you eyes off the screen
May 14 2015,positive,george miller might be a lunatic but hes a genius exceeded my expectations  faithful to the legacy of the series best movie ive seen this year so far  definitely the best action movie in a long time its a very very mad world
May 14 2015,positive,my best mainstram film experience so far this year great way to revive a franchise
May 14 2015,negative,dumb plot its  like going on a drive for 2hrs when you get to your destination you realize you forgot your wallet and head home the action scenes felt kind of cliche the dialogue felt forced the scenery felt lack luster and dont go wasting your time on 3d luckily i dont do 3d only worth watching if your a mad max fan if your not you will be disappointed
May 14 2015,positive,the best mad max installment from george millers mad mind of filmmaking  the man has brought back his love for this franchise directing a postapocalyptic actionier for a new generation of fans  its been 30 years since mel gibson made his debut as the titular character surviving in a world thats lost all hope rules and mercy  tom hardy now steps into the shoes of this troubled excop along with a new dangerous mission  the plot is fairly simple and it makes sense this time given the world miller has built   charlize theron comes in as furiousa and she decides to strike back at her overlord immorten joe by taking away something of his since he took away something of hers when she was a child  what follows is a chase through the desert wastelands involving this rulers breedstock of women for future warlords  theres also a second goal for these women on the run to find a new paradise to start life again the right way and not under a tyrannical rule  max then gets caught up in the middle of the pursuit and is faced with a daring scenario while dealing with the ghosts of his past he too himself is afraid of going truly mad  the whole film is essentially an action flick and its pretty fun from beginning to finish  all of the stunts with the exception of a few cgi shots are done practical and look highly convincing   the filmmakers finally have the budget this time around to go bigger badder and insaner than the previous films  in a twist therons furiousa actually has more screentime than max she does have a motive to get back at the destroyed world left behind and hopefully have some kind of repent    the music is also has pretty organic badass quality to it as it matches the massive landscape as well as the highspeed chases  an amazing cast with topnotch action with super enjoyment  this 4th mad max movie is another example of a summer popcorn flick that delivers the goods  who knows if they can make another one and build even more upon this idea of a world thats lost its mind  what a day what a lovely day
May 14 2015,positive,i have nothing but good things to say about mad max fury road every aspect of this film works for what its trying to accomplish charlize theron steals the show as furiosa and tom hardy does adequate work as the new max junkie xls driving score amps up the adrenaline the feminist undertones are powerful without being annoying of course fury road is an action movie first and foremost so the most impressive part of this movie is the stunt work what george miller and company managed to accomplish with their practical effects is masterful and the cinematography perfectly captures every bit of the action the set and costume designers deserve props too for their contributions allinall mad max fury road deserves every bit of praise it has earned this is one of my favorite movies of alltime and it gets better with each viewing if you love action movies youre doing yourself a disservice if you havent seen it
May 14 2015,positive,insanely good movie well worth the money
May 14 2015,positive,amazing action scenes and very good acting by charlize and tom make this a great popcorn flick
May 14 2015,positive,a mad adrenaline joy ride from start to finish if you love action films you owe to yourself to watch this film
May 14 2015,positive,mad max fury road is a colossal heartpumping grindfest stimulating all senses imaginable george miller has finally gained access to the right amount of technology and money to bring his creative mind to life and it is beautiful in all shapes and forms with high octane action the music the colours the cinematography the camera angles the costumes everything blends together so well it forms a perfect steroid for the mind and eyes lets not forget the brilliant acting by our leading man tom hardy a barely speaking mindtwisted hero with one goal in mind survival aided by the crazy and slowly reforming nicholas hoult driven by the confident and driven theron as the clearminded furiosa this movie is bloodpumping and more lively than anything seen on screen in years mad max fury road has redefined the action genre and made a colossal imprint on the industry
May 14 2015,positive,the cinematography was spectacular charlize was friggin amazing but max was  incidental and that was disappointing the script had hardy mostly in the background or sidelines and even when he wasnt i had little sense of personality or charisma from him especially in comparison to charlize  the story line was just one big car chase an amazing car chase for sure but it felt like it was just a single note sung for a long two hours i enjoyed the original mad max worlds and am very impressed with george millers creativity and attention to detail but i did not love fury road will not see it again not interesting enough to rent when it comes out later a far step below my favorite action movie of the year  furious 7
May 14 2015,positive,what and awesome movie
May 14 2015,neutral,mad max fury road not so great actually kinda disappointed action scenes were good but story was very choppy and lift a lot of stuff just unexplained
May 14 2015,positive,its rare that a large film like this inspires much out of me so im excited about this one and hope it kicks some ass so that we can get more like it gon see it this weekend and show some support
May 14 2015,positive,not saying that a new comer cant enjoy it but if you are not familiar with the way these films work then dont bother you might be disappointed and may not not enjoy it my suggestion is to at least watch mad max and its sequel the road warrior if you like what you see then most definitely go no run and go see this amazing film it most definitely lives up to its hype and well worth the wait
May 14 2015,positive,well damn thats was intense
May 14 2015,positive,this movie taught me how to feel again
May 14 2015,positive,it wasso epic
May 14 2015,positive,fury road is vicious and pulsating to say the least miller executes every moment perfectly and makes sure each frame is packed with action and tension you can tell tom hardy understands how to play max and charlize theron acts as his perfect compliment fury road is also one of the best looking movies youll see in a long time and is packed with awesome imagery if you havent seen it in 3d you have to as miller knows how to perfectly execute it fury road is a 2 hour roller coaster that proves to be the action movie of the year sorry age of ultron
May 14 2015,positive,george miller the director has pulled off a neat trick here  a movie both familiar and totally original violent and logical harrowing and personal and just a little offkilter this is one crazyass movie
May 14 2015,positive,an epic movie that will stand the test of time
May 14 2015,positive,an action juggernaut which other action films will be compared to for years to come likely the mustsee movie of the summer
May 14 2015,positive,its very good must watch a cant miss
May 14 2015,positive,remakes and sequels have one thing in common  rarely ever as good or better than the original
May 14 2015,positive,this moive is fresh very good non stop action
May 14 2015,positive,insane non stop action
May 14 2015,positive,an insanely awesome achievement
May 14 2015,positive,i may not be a professional critic but it did not feel like a mad max movie it was a great movie and tom hardy is a great actor but  i feel that the character of max was incomplete
May 14 2015,positive,totally crazyy papito
May 14 2015,positive,i have a new favorite guitarist
May 14 2015,positive,one hell of a fun ride
May 14 2015,positive,legenfuckindary
May 14 2015,positive,really freaking awesome
May 14 2015,positive,this sequel and reboot of the classic action franchise brings mad max soaring vigorously back to life with a two hour action extravaganza that puts everything attempted in the original trilogy to shame the original mad max trilogy was gritty and violent but compared to the colorful landscapes and gorgeous scenery of fury road it looks like a totally different franchise if this was the true vision of george miller im glad he finally was able to put it on screen my only complaint is that tom hardys max is not nearly as charismatic as mel gibson was in the original trilogy i didnt connect with him like i did in the others but luckily max is more of a supporting character in this one that the main focus charlize therons furiosa is more of the main lead and adds a great character and female action hero to cinema history i also really enjoyed nicholaus hoult as nux and hugh keaysbyrne return to the franchise with a memorable villain in immortan joe if you like action movies theres not reason not to watch the indescribable carnage george miller has concocted with fury road
May 14 2015,positive,probably one of the greatest action movies this decade it was visually amazing i only wish there was more character development
May 14 2015,positive,2 hours of pure insanity
May 14 2015,positive,mostly powerful movie of this year
May 14 2015,positive,best movie in years outstanding performance
May 14 2015,positive,very entertaining and exciting i really enjoyed it
May 14 2015,negative,this movie was absolutely the worst thing i have ever laid my eyes on this movie goes from women being milked and the rock drinking it from fat guys will bloated feet with cut out nipple holes in his shirt with a chain piercing connected to each nipple i legitimately wanted to hang my self after seeing this piece of crap you call a movie if you see this movie may god have mercy on your soul
May 14 2015,positive,blistering fast powerful clip sensational real stunts excellent acting great support performances watch out here comes australia this is what it can do  strong feminist themes do not mess with these women interesting male roles a work of art packed to the hilt with feasts for the eye and ear  a vast array of super entertainment and good clean fun for the whole family
May 14 2015,positive,amazing fun storyline is lacking and at times nonexistent but who needs a storyline when theres a cirque du soleil show on cars surrounded by explosions i just hope that i can one day reach a level of awesome that necessitates my having a caravan that contains a monster truck with the sole purpose of housing a heavy metal band spewing rockin tunes and fire
May 14 2015,positive,wow full on road warrior
May 14 2015,negative,im giving it this rating due to the fact of everyone blowing it its actually a b its about 20 mins to long and the entire movie on the war rig and in the desert its very tiresome all in all its a decent flick
May 14 2015,negative,thumbs up to wb for the brilliant marketing of this completely rubbish movie thumbs down for the recycling of tom hardys costume in batman remember that breathing mask  its back but on a new baddie but thumbs up for putting a new mask on him because as far as that casting goes thats another thumbs down big thumbs down luckily big thumbs up he has nothing to say because big thumbs down nobody spent a dime on the script
May 14 2015,positive,best movie of 2015 amazing visuals and exciting car chase scenes
May 14 2015,positive,i grew up an 80s kid and with the brand new invention of the turn dial 36 channel cable and no dvr i watched a lot of movies maybe i shouldnt have watched but did one movie i watched and fell in love with on that box was mad max beyond thunderdome on tv that post apocalyptic world was mind blowing to me as a kid and really opened my imagination of what that world could be like i immediately had to rent mad max and road warrior which became my favorite of the original best part was mel gibsons mad max love or hate him now i cant forget his talents as a actor and director he was young as mad max and i idolized him as a mans man as much as han solo or indiana jones so when i heard george miller was doing a new one i was beyond excited i thought the 3 didnt quite give enough of that world for me well its fulfilled it and much more with this one this movie kicks ass with clean real no cgi old school action and tom hardy killed it as max not as mels max but taking his likeness and making it his own to me he is mad max as much as daniel craig is bond now charlize theron wow heres a heroine a girl can idolized like i did with max dont listen to those activists theyd probably give aliens a hard time cause ripley was a girl to and anybody that seen it knows that was badass i love that it gives you a lot about the mythology of the wasteland world while still leaving you in the dark to come up with your own assumptions or leave it for a sequel to play out more of it there wasnt a lot of dialogue but george miller brilliantly found ways to emotionally invest you in the characters through looks or scenarios and you cared so much that you feared for their lives go see this movie in theaters you will regret it if you dont i saw it in 3d and was well worth it and plan on seeing it again in 2d to experience it again support this movie so it gets green light for a sequel tom hardy has signed for three more and miller has a script for the sequel
May 14 2015,positive,just saw it with my son it was everything i could want from a mad max movie and more
May 14 2015,positive,mad max fury road is an amazing action movie that starts fast and never lets go tom hardy is fantastic as max and charlize theron is also incredible george miller thank you for maybe the best true action movie of this decade

May 14 2015,positive,100 action packedi love itsuperbly done
May 14 2015,negative,mel gibson has nothing to worry about here more for the wrestling crowd
May 14 2015,positive,holy goddamn best movie of the year so far  the first glimpse of maxs torrid landscape feels hot enough to split your lips this is visceral action the kind we used to get a ton of in the 90s and in my opinion an instant classic in the action genre
May 14 2015,positive,an almost literally nonstop thrill ride with some of the best action sequences in recent memory surprisinglycomplex characters and like yeah just go watch this movie
May 14 2015,positive,batsht insane action highly recommended for action film fans
May 14 2015,positive,well that that was entertaining
May 14 2015,positive,an absolute visual treat
May 14 2015,positive,savage angry fast and brilliant what more is there to say
May 14 2015,positive,wowincredible beautifully insane a perfect mad max 4 this was mad max on steroids
May 14 2015,positive,best action movie in years maybe it was because cgi didnt take over every scene
May 14 2015,positive,just an amazingly entertaining thrill ride
May 14 2015,positive,you want the action  now you got it all hail to george miller its truly omfg action flick of alltime
May 14 2015,negative,waste of time gross  senseless and miscast in the starring roles
May 14 2015,positive,saw it in 3d  fun flick
May 14 2015,positive,not a big plot not the best acting in the world but dam thats some great action and most of this movie isnt action unlike what many say at most 55 of it is action probably even less
May 14 2015,positive,this year has been invaded by extravagant movies that feature stunning camerawork and dazzling special effects without a single trace of heart and interpretation jurassic world avengers age of ultron everest mission impossible v terminator genisys tomorrowland joe wrights pan jupiter ascending 50 shades of grey fantastic four maze runner ii insurgent and furious 7 are examples of great imagery and poor dramatic execution of course some of them better than others but everything is not lost due to one man and his bizarre but astounding imagination george miller and his crew of kamikaze filmmakers depict a desperate world of primeval instincts in this entertaining and quite possibly essential film mad max fury road is a genuine masterpiece in every single aspect screenwriting cinematography sound design acting editing costume design stunts music set decoration makeup and directing the film excels in its narrative because of the symbols regarding lost childhood and vanished humanity strong gender metaphors and the environmental ideas it works with perfection is an insignificant substantive to describe the best movie of 2015
May 14 2015,positive,hardcore action will stick you to your seat
May 14 2015,positive,after watching this i realized how bad most modern action movies have been as a fan of 2 12 of the original series thunderdome went of the rails after gulag i was skeptical at first but so wonderfully surprised at the level of story and emotion that they were able to embody amongst all the the thrilling action sequences brilliant job i cant wait to enjoy it again
May 14 2015,positive,its one fucked up movie but in a good way
May 14 2015,positive,the quintessential mad max movie on steroids miller shows how a bigger budget goes a long way and creates an epic film that is a non stop thrill ride but know what your getting into know what mad max is before you watch this film its weird which is to be expected
May 14 2015,positive,mad max fury road is the kind of postapocalyptic fantasy that akira kurosawa would have made and that john woo is too wimpy to make  its nonstop action only gets more exciting as it goes along and its ugly setting and brutality seem absolutely beautiful in george millers hands  one of the great modern films
May 14 2015,positive,really good reboot of the franchise mostly full of action sequences still really good and enjoyable it sets the foundation for the sequels even though it lacks of strong dialogues
May 14 2015,positive,saw it last week and it was effin amazing
May 14 2015,negative,its just basically just one long over bloated car chase someone should have told george miler that sometimes less is more this lacks the raw and grit of the first two movies and is far too cartoonish and polished looking tom hardy doesnt come anywhere near close to matching the screen presence or charisma that mel gibson displayed in the title role and you wonder why hes in it at all and even though george miller still has a good imagination the writing is downright poor at times and the action scenes are edited in a very fast cutting style that ruins the suspense and danger road warrior this aint
May 14 2015,positive,yo this movie is something else im an action fan but not a very hardcore one movies really have to be good for me to get into them this movie had everything lacking from modern action yeah it was full of explosions and a sort of outlandish dystopian society but it that not the fun of action either way charlize theron kicked ass tom hardy kicked ass everyone kicked ass and there was no unnecessary gore to distract from this cinematic beauty its entertaining it has characters youll end up loving and just enough man pain that every action movies seems to have but unlike those other movies no one actually gives a fuck about it ignore all the controversy around this go see it for yourself and decide trust me youll be on the edge of your seat the whole ride
May 14 2015,positive,i dont know man it doesnt get better than this really
May 14 2015,positive,go now to see this movie you are not going to see anything better this year
May 14 2015,positive,perfect harks back to the original but truly stands on its own
May 14 2015,positive,this movie was everything it advertised it would be mad max running from a bunch of crazy looking bad guys explosions and car crashes they nailed it if you are looking for a movie with witty dialogue and intricate story line watch something else but if you want to be on the edge of your seat watching a bad ass save slaves from a psychopathic tyrant and his brainwashed hairless cronies then this movie is for you plus there is a car that is essentially a giant portable guitar amp with a guitar that shoots flames i dont know why it was there but it was and it was awesome
May 14 2015,negative,its like being inside the brain of a 13yearold teenage boy tripping on acid with awkward nipple fantasies who enjoys blowing up monster trucks in a sandbox    i love a good action film but have never laughed at such blatant sexism and such a ridiculous script these are my mates harry and larry tom hardy exclaims in a grumbled sean connery accent while pointing to two shoulder ballspimples with drawn on happy faces  what zoom out to a grotesque clan leader with elephantiasis of the foot who stands there playing with his nipple chains while surrounded by hundreds of warriors which are a mix between pale man pans labyrinth and the sand people from star wars and the joker    and lets not forget the scantily clad airheaded australian womentheyre not strong enough to use the chain cutters to free hardys character which moments later he cuts with one hand to free himself they run around the desert in cheesecloths with no idea on what is going on and in a moment of crisis with explosions in the background and heavymetal guitarist swinging from the adjacent car  the pregnant blonde hangs out of the door of the war rig by one arm rubbing her bare belly and saves the day    95 the movie is spent with furious speed chases that goes from end to end of a sandy subjugated land with its terrible writing and unoriginal ideas the only redeeming quality is the fact that yes it does have excellent cgi basically if you take davy jones octopus face from pirates of the caribbean shove him in a monster truck powered by breast milk im not kidding seriously whats up with these nipple fantasies mix in the worst elements from the fast and the furious tokyo drift and place them in a scene from desert runners movie youve got mad max
May 14 2015,positive,a stunning visual treat a movie that captures the essence of the 80s classics like road warrior and conan and paints them on a canvas of high definition beauty i actually cared about these characters without them hardly saying a word and was totally in awe of this high octane battle that hardly took a breath but never bored me once as it was clear there was something at stake for the viewer to get behind   without a doubt i will be watching this again as it needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible the best film of 2015 so far by a mile
May 14 2015,positive,now thats how you do it oh my god not only do i think mad max fury road is the best film in the franchise but i believe its one of the greatest action movies ever made george miller the man behind all the other films not only brings the franchise back to life but it steps everything up the visuals are amazing the action is top notch and it has shown us that the mastermind himself has still got it if people think this movie is overrated i can see where their coming from fury road for some people does seem to just be a twohour action sequence however i did find a lot more to this movie than that one of the things about the mad max movies is that they were not very dialoguedriven but rather told mainly through visual storytelling and that continues here plus there is a story told through this two hour sequence and the action and chases actually play an important part its a road actionescort mission film  so the action plays a major part in the story which is why having it focus a lot on the action and thrills doesnt really bother me so much
May 14 2015,negative,felt like one big car chase didnt feel like there was much of a plot
May 14 2015,positive,full of action and hot rod racers fire and dirt loved the lead cast members hope their is a sequel in stored 
May 14 2015,positive,this movie is wild  literally 2 hours of straight action barely any dialogue  and max doesnt steal the show its charlize theron 
May 14 2015,positive,and so we go back to the desolate post apocalyptic world george miller created in 1979 with a young brash mel gibson seeking vengeance on the groups of survivors trying to take anything and everything they can fast forward 36 years to 2015 utilize the ability to boost your budget tremendously sprinkle a tiny bit of dialogue into an action packed film and i mean action packed 90 of this film is action then you throw in one of the biggest upcoming actors in the action department and toss in one of the worlds most gorgeous creatures and you have yourself mad max fury road    ill start with the acting because it was pretty great for a film that didnt have a ton of major plot points and needed conversations especially since max tom hardy had a very small amount of them if i had to guess maybe 30 lines including the prologue he gives at the beginning to tell us how we got to this point right off the get go performance of the film is imperator furiosa charlize theron who brings the emotion and maybe the most anger to the film a woman sought on redemption and is willing to do anything to grab it then theres nicholas hoult who plays nux one of the bad guys but is he a bad guy he just wants to make his leader proud and then gets tangled in this mess of what is the right thing by the way most people wont recognize him off the get go due to the awesome makeup and costume department this film had for those who arent familiar he plays hankbeast in all the newest xmen films id give the acting a two thumbs up they all did well especially for an action first talk later type of film    speaking of action man alive this is some top notch ahead of its time stuff the reason why i say that is because most action films these days lean too much on the shoulders of cgi for success in hard to please places this film i honestly dont know if i saw any cgi besides the gigantic sand tornados within the first 30 minutes of the film these stunts and action sequences are all done by real human beings and boy you had to have some balls to pull some of these off just the driving alone is incredible not to mention the fighting from vehicle to vehicle going at speeds of 60 mph im not one to give stuff away so i wont mention specific instances but just look for the one with a dude on a dirt bike who decides to slide under a gigantic war machine its non stop the jaw dropping moments i cant say enough about it other than some of the best choreographed action ive seen in many years as a whole    the scenery got to talk about this this might be the highlight to me of the entire film miller just knows how to create sets that look real and you have to continually look around to catch new stuff everywhere you look theres something beautiful to look at the best part is they arent cgi green screen sets this was filmed in australia and the sets they actually built for the film the vehicles something straight out of the video game series twisted metal but with a very serious demented mass murderer twist to it these things are war machines and you dont fuck with them excuse my language i got excited because these things are unreal spikes continuos amounts of bombs and weapons and posts that swing up in the air so you can drop a bomb in you enemies lap in the drivers seat its gorgeous and it makes me want to do some modifications to my toyota camry     alright about done here one thing to note this is a pure action film with little plot not a ton of dialogue besides threats to one another and screaming its loud a visual specimen that will give most movie lovers an orgasm its kind of like seeing something beautiful for the first time like the grand canyon the rocky mountains or the ocean you just cant look away and you want more and this film continues to give you more halfway through youll ask yourself well how do they top that scene no worries friends it happens i dont give this film a perfect score because i have a hard time believing any film is perfect theres always a flaw somewhere well i didnt see it i expect to find it when i see it the next 100 times i watch but then again i might not so basically its a perfect 55 but im too scared to give it that completely ill leave you with this go in ready for action ready for fun and 2 hours of your time that will fly by because of how great this film is i think it just might be the best action genre film ive seen in a very long time oh and even with a shaved head and 1 and half arms charlize theron still might be one of the sexiest women on the planet 455 jd
May 14 2015,positive,mediocre is a pejorative in the world of mad max and accordingly fury road is anything but i could list some adjectives to describe it  thrilling arresting exhilarating etc  but they would all fall short of conveying the feeling of actually watching it its been quite a long time since a films left me with such a high i cant recommend it strongly enough bigbudget cinema just doesnt get any better
May 14 2015,positive,just so much to look at awesome
May 14 2015,positive,a really solid and enjoyable movie  better than i had anticipated    i think one of the things that makes this movie work is that it was made more as a reboot rather than a sequel     also the fact that original director george miller returned helped too
May 14 2015,positive,best film of 2015 so far
May 14 2015,positive,completely insane and original just a completely mindblowing incredible masterpiece please go see this movie
May 14 2015,positive,fang it  so much massive epic flaming crashing jumping shooting and exploding car action  the cars really are the main characters and everyone else is just a long for the ride a little silly at times but fits well with the feel of beyond thunderdome and the result is an absolutely incredible chase that runs from start to finish
May 14 2015,positive,george millers work here is better than what he did as a young man what an amazing experience if you dont see this film in 3d i really think you miss something significant my favorite of the series without question
May 14 2015,positive,what a lovely ride non stop grinding adrenalin fast and furious directors take note this is how you do action chase and crash scenes and not just film cars and speed up in post production
May 14 2015,positive,really nice images a breathtaking chase led by a nearly mute tom hardy excellent in this role as always and a charlize theron totally hypnotic in her crazy postapocalyptic redemption looker 05 less than 5 because the scenario is only existing because there has to be one but definitly one of the most intense fim from 2015 and from the last few years generally speaking
May 14 2015,positive,the best way to sum up this film is simply a dusty rusty gritty punch to face its a relentless film that is that action packed you dont have time to be concerned by a plot    its seems to be the continuation of the mad max series  it was so refreshing to see a genuine action film not a complete saturation of cgi action    also great to see a lot of australian performers like john howard  megan gale its a real adrenaline trip that is wildly entertaining
May 14 2015,positive,this movie is insanely awesome mad max fury road all action films should aspire to be 10 as awesome as this mother of god amazing  im still buzzing with all my wordifying skills i lack the verbal tools to describe its awesomeness everything just comes out sounding weird the drummersguitar version of buglerspiperswardrums in the warbands is awesome so is everything else i will be exchanging actual money for the bluray when it comes out
May 14 2015,positive,such a good film
May 14 2015,positive,not madcap but just the best action film ever it doesnt pretend and its just out thereloved the mental riders with the flame throwing guitars
May 14 2015,positive,i saw mad max last week and i rate it at 100 or 5 stars  it stayed true to the franchise but cranked up a thousand notches  once the action begins there is barely a moment to rest  your eyes  it is visually great serious and really funny at times
May 14 2015,positive,oh what a day what a lovely day   george miller                                  
May 14 2015,negative,i clearly didnt watch the same film as all the reviewers it went nowhere literally
May 14 2015,positive,mad max is back and so is george miller stylish and impeccably directed fury road sets a new standard for action
May 14 2015,positive,youtubecomfilmgob    flesh and metal collide in the part sequel part reboot post apocalyptic no holds barred mad max fury road 70 year old director george miller returns to the franchise he created 30 years after the last outing this time with tom hardy as max and charlize theron as furiosa two rebels trying to survive in a desert landscape of lost humanity     the plot is fairly simple imperator furiosa abandons her duties and sets out to find her homeland and take immortal joes young brides with her joe of course sets out to stop her and max is caught up in this battle charlize theron is fantastic as furiosa with her artificial limb and war paint determined to find her home and reunite with whats left of her family tom hardy as max is a man of few words troubled by visions of past horrors both need to work together as they guide the fragile and beautiful brides of joe to safety the film has a core theme of feminist solidarity that balances well against the testosterone of max immortal joe and his war boys the performances from the two leads and their mutual respect is told mainly through actions rather than dialogue exposition takes a back seat here    unlike previous films in the series the budget this time around of 150 million finally matches the ambitions and imagination of the director the sheer originality on display is impressive stunning photography high contrast warm colour palette and smooth camera work draw you into the wild west wasteland  the jaw dropping carnage of the action scenes are indescribable fast  furious is a walk in the park compared to this you must see it to believe it but even then you still ask yourself is this actually happening it has the right mix of cgi and real stunts that will make you think back to classics like james camerons terminator 2 and it all looks awesome in 3d imax the score by tom holkenborg aka junkie xl is loud heart pounding epic and in sync with the bizarre but soon to be iconic flamethrower guitarist and tribal drummers who get their fair share of screen time     are there any negatives to the film only a few immortal joe was fine as the main villain but the bullet farmer and the people eater lacked depth i wanted more time with them to understand their reasons for actually being part of the chase joes brides which included zoe kravitz and rosie huntingtonwhiteley werent the best performers and were quite bad at times    so despite all that i highly recommend this film if for some strange reason youve been sitting on the fence its feral dark gritty anarchic surreal just pure mayhem mad max fury road isnt just any action film its one that sits side by side with your favourite hollywood blockbusters a new classic that demands repeat viewings for its visual triumphs and sonic assaults now if you excuse me im off to watch it again
May 14 2015,positive,mad max fury road played like a non stop rollercoaster thrill ride it was like watching an old fashioned action movie without all the added effects im glad they still make movies like this cant wait for the sequel george miller needs to keep making movies
May 14 2015,positive,good watch cant go wrong with this film
May 14 2015,positive,about 90 percent of the film is just action and its all so damn beautiful
May 14 2015,positive,the most intense experience in a while the chase cars spikes tires explosions things flying in the air and just ridiculous but oh so beautiful scenes also not hollow at all instead a clear statement for human rights and humanity in general amazing movie 3
May 14 2015,positive,totally insane just like driving round the m25 âº
May 14 2015,positive,im not necessarily a mad max fan going in to see the tom hardyled fourth installment in the franchise i only loved road warrior  the second installment  but as the movie ended i realized something this sequel makes the entire franchise each and every installment much better simply by being associated with fury road its that good    for the full review go here 
May 14 2015,positive,crazy and insane and that why we love mad max
May 14 2015,positive,pure action and awesome chase scenes and stunts where was the story
May 14 2015,positive,what  lovely day what a lovely day    i think its safe to say before mad max road fury was announced it was a pipe dream for the fans  of this lets face it cult movie it ended with a bit of a whimper with beyond blunderdome so when it comes back and with the original director  the man behind the previous 3 so fans were rightly excited my response was more tepid but obviously critical acclaim can make you sit up and take notice and boy has this garnered that    the man that reinvented the postapocalyptic genre is to do a bit more with the genre mostly been reduced to ya novels with bland and uninteresting worlds miller has returned with the classic dust and aggression feel of the previous films with gibson out and hardy in as the titular max  who is suffering from a guilt problem as far as story goes it doesnt beyond a currying a to b kind of thing  a video game staple of the escort mission thats it boiled down but the story isnt as important as the action sequences the feel and strong female presence    for as much as this is titled mad max its just as much about a group of women helmed by furiosa charlize theron on the run after freeing a band of slave women intended as nothing more than baby makers from king joe hugh keaysbyrne and his group of halflifes a bunch of crazed baldheaded follows of the king seeing him like a god and a deliverer king joe is a psychopath and thats it theres no trying to redeem him show more of his ideals because hes a villain thats what villains are you dont need any more    so for the meat of the film its on the road with dynamic action sequences that almost seem like they couldnt possibly have been choreographed theyre unlike most films putting to shame in parts furious 7 ideas with the backdrop of the desolate wasteland and the heavy metal sound that comes with king joes entourage of men it doesnt stop only breathing in spades the word relentless never seemed more appropriate    my only complaints lay in the lack of character development and towards the end while the action aspect was still well done it got a little monotonous  but think thats more my issue the former being more the issue while furiosa is and the lost nux who has the most detailed character arc mostly fleshed out everyone else is somewhat of a silhouette to me max feeling no more fleshed than those that spend there time under a car tyre     but it all fits thats what makes it so good ill be honest i thought the mass of acclaim was a bit ridiculous beforehand  but thats easy beforehand but i get it everything clicks the stunts outdoing each other one after another its a world of no mistakes  you make one you get killed and whats so great is its lack of violence in a visual sense you only see whats needed where other films might spend a moment or two on an arm being ripped off with all the blood and bone on show mad max doesnt and its this thoughtful approach that makes you know this wasnt an accident it was all intentional    theres limited dialogue its mostly in cars and the story is as simple as they come  searching for something that has already passed you by yet mad max road fury is a fine film and a resounding success the acting is fantastic and the visual sensibilities and action sequences are top tier its precisely what the film needed to be it would be easy to view this as luck given its perceived simplicity but it isnt everything has been carefully put together to create a harsh desolate and frantic world everything its title promises
May 14 2015,positive,visually stunning gripping atmosphere from the word go highly recommended especially in imex 3d
May 14 2015,positive,mad max fury road  complete madness best action movie of the decade 55
May 14 2015,neutral,impressive visuals fantastic action and an awesome soundtrack can only help so much little plot an annoying turnaround unexplained context a lead who hardly leads his own film left me feeling exhausted by the end of it with only the action to try and keep me entertained
May 14 2015,positive,nonstop action and amazing cinematographybest action movie in a long time
May 14 2015,positive,visually spectacular cinematically brilliant best summer action movie out right now and an excellent addition to the mad max story
May 14 2015,positive,fucking fantastic could use a bit extra explanation and more graphic violence here and there but lets hope an unrated version will be released for blu ray it was astonishingly shot great action and cool stunt choreography overwhelming music
May 14 2015,positive,with crazy insane and hardcore action sequences with some solid performances fury road is a complete kickass adrenaline fueled experience thats best viewed on the big screen
May 14 2015,positive,apocalyptic   this is entertainment to the maddest max  saw it today in 3d action packed plenty of interesting characters stunning visuals amazing stunts
May 14 2015,positive,an appetite for destruction is quelled upon viewing but its thirsty work out in the lush desert landscape and will only have you begging for more fury road is an instant classic they dont make movies like this anymore until now
May 14 2015,positive,from the opening sequence until the final credits roll mad max fury road is a pulse pounding edge of your seat rip roaring film  george miller tom hardy and charlize theron team up for to me anyway the best film so far in 2015  if you are not familiar with the mad max films you may be a bit lost as to what brings max to this place and time however through some minor flashbacks and voice over we learn that society fell maxs family was killed and he is guilty that he was unable to protect him  he is captured by the immortan joe and used as a blood bag for one of his warriors as he goes to bring back theron and the wives that she is helping to escape    the stunts are spectacular and very little of the action is done on green screen  there also is very little dialogue but that does not distract from the movie but instead focuses on the physical performances of the stars and stunt people  there is a driving sound track that fits the action and keeps your heart pounding from start to finish  over all a worthy addition to the mad max series
May 14 2015,positive,awesomely awesomenessbest of the best thank you george miller
May 14 2015,positive,wow much better than expected
May 14 2015,positive,a 2hour long epic chase scene that is truly extraordinary
May 14 2015,positive,adrenaline fuelled majesty absolutely brilliant   what a lovely day
May 14 2015,negative,white body make up scull props car chase with man playing guitar frantically   thats pretty much it
May 14 2015,positive,this film is an artistic joyride into the insane aftermath of a murdered world
May 14 2015,positive,this film knows how to tell a story through its characters and what explosive and resonant characters to do it with the whole film is visually delicious and emotionally it keeps you riding with it perfectly through every twist and bump    charlize theron as imperator furiosa is one of the best characters ive seen on screen shes badass shes got mystery shes such a hero she owns the film right up to the last shots in particular its great to see a female character that the film isnt afraid to kick the crap out of and have her come back fighting to give as good as she gets    im not usually into these types of films but ill be seeing this again soon look past the action and bloodthirsty adventure and theres some powerful messages and a carefully crafted world that lives breaths and roars    s
May 14 2015,negative,is everyone on drugs no where near as good as the first two  very disappointed this is just another sub par remake  ffs make something original with a plot
May 14 2015,positive,this movie exceeded my expectations and they were high to begin with its full of action over the top and keeps you on the edge of your seat
May 14 2015,positive,in an absolutely high octane ballstothewall return to the character and the world mad max fury road manages to keep a breakneck pace and absolutely heartpounding practical action scenes going without losing focus of character and plot development
May 14 2015,positive,mad max is an action packed non stop adrenaline rush but thin on plot who cares though
May 14 2015,positive,effing mind blowing spectacle
May 14 2015,positive,saw it last night in 3d great to see this franchise brought to life again action packed and plenty of interesting characters to keep you interested in the apocalyptic world of mad max
May 14 2015,neutral,mad max puts so much fury into fury roads intense action sequences that story and character development are almost nonexistent throughout the entire 2 hour carnage what wasted empty overkill
May 14 2015,positive,holy cow  99 on rt  gotta see this one  i had my doubts but it looks like max is bax  whooop
May 14 2015,positive,the word is gratuitous gratuitous action violence epic scale gratuitous badassery
May 14 2015,neutral,my husband hated it i liked it okay i am not familiar with the mad max franchise but was able to understand the storyline and deduce the premise for the film there were some really beautiful visually striking scenes there was also some really random weird stuff along the way that i found entertaining in a comical way like what is going on i would give it a 4 myself but averaging with my husbands score who is not a fan of strangeness and overthetop artistry we settled at a 25
May 14 2015,positive,this is a twisted metal orgy of gasoline soaked blood and living nightmares realized and i love it 3
May 14 2015,positive,saw it this morningwow  it raises the bar the same way daniel craigs bond and christopher nolans batman did to its lineage plus miller used little cgi preferring to have real stunts  old school and it works  action movie of the year
May 14 2015,positive,over the top action and plenty of interesting characters  mad max fury road confidently creates its own world and you never question it no matter how outlandish it is 
May 14 2015,positive,stunts and effects are amazing but no real plot max tom hardy is a bit redundant and its more about charlize theron
May 14 2015,positive,george miller once again made australian proud  tom hardy as max was awesome and ironic  charlize theron as furiosa turned those super action woman like angelina jolie jennifer lawrence or milla jovovich into useless  hands down the best movie of this summer and one of the best action movies of the decade
May 14 2015,positive,one of those rare alladrenaline action film done well pacing scene buildup and most importantly carefully planned movement counts in every frame there is empathy on the characters despite little background about them anyway it could have that r18 blood
May 14 2015,positive,a marvelous bloody ride d  what a lovely day 
May 14 2015,positive,the action was amazing the story left a little to be desired
May 14 2015,positive,nice to watch at theatre in 3d format
May 14 2015,positive,first time ever i come out from a theater stunned to silence damn
May 14 2015,positive,what a thrill ride nearly nonstop action for 2 hours gets your adrenaline pumping all the way story aside its weird original and fun charlize theron is  the new sigourney weaver of tough women roles best ive seen this year so far it makes avengers age of ultron look like a daytime cartoon
May 14 2015,positive,what a ride what a lovely ride
May 14 2015,positive,wowsers what an experience that was edge of the seat jaw dropping post apocalyptic action it felt so fresh vibrant and visceral i liked the characters i thought in particular charlize theron was so great such great directing by george miller i had never seen a mad max movie before this but now i feel tempted to go back and watch the earlier ones d
May 14 2015,positive,golly what a ride always refreshing to see a reboot done right im calling you out robocop mad cow max has the perfect blend of cheesinessartsy style and badassery it has everything from flame throwing guitars to human hybrid giraffe thingsyou know what im talking about if youve seen the movie the entire audience bursted out laughing when those creatures walked the screen ridiculous     as usual tom harder puts on yet another hearty performance this time as a blood bag charlize herrington also did a swell job she was the most dynamic character and that guy from warm bodies stayed in zombie character with a newly shaved head but i also gotta hand it to the main villain my goodness what a menacing bastard he was pretty cool how they had the original bad guy from the first movie play the new bad guy in the new movie little fact if you werent aware    the previews made me think this was going to be another garbage rebootturned franchise but i was delightfully mistaken definitely worth a second watch    no black folk were harmed in the making of this film nor did any make a paycheckor any screen timesorry tyler perry
May 14 2015,positive,some loved it some hated it i draw my opinion right down the middle some elements such as the attention to detail across wonderful panoramas are great most of the characters make efforts to make the unusual landscape believable but the main antagonist and a few others draw the the viewer away from a sense of realism into most of a comic book chase caper
May 14 2015,negative,horrible dont waste the time you will never get it back
May 14 2015,positive,quite good movie but considering the hype from major reviewers giving the movie 5 star reviews i expected more some reviews stated that it was one long chase scene constant action which is inaccurate as there are multiple lulls at least one of with was rather lengthy    the movie was still quite good i just wish reviewers hadnt overhyped it    definitely loved the actionchase sequences though some ridiculous stunts very well done
May 14 2015,positive,mad max fury road is ferocious engrossing and completely badass director george millers take on the cultfavorite outlaw series is relentless in scope and perfectly paced from its explosive start to the fiery finale theron plays the real hero in this one and she does so with a passion that we havent seen from her in years tom hardys portrayal of max is dark and internal which fits the lore of the series well but also stands out as something deeper than an overly loyal portrayal a standout performance from nicholas hoult as the valhallaready nux adds a new level of insanity to the mix that bleeds into the rustic aesthetic of this brilliant postapocalyptic world fury road is everything it needed to be and it pumps life back into this captivating saga with gasoline and blood
May 14 2015,positive,nothing short of a spectacular miracle it exceeds your expectations on every conceivable level and will likely remain the gold standard for action blockbuster filmmaking for decades to come that george miller could return to this franchise 30 years later and make a movie that could easily be the best mad max entry is not something anyone could have anticipated
May 14 2015,positive,relentless action from beginning to end  apocalyptic vision at its most epic
May 14 2015,positive,full joy ride the whole way less talking more action d
May 14 2015,positive,okay the one guy that voted rotten out of the critics liked 50 shades of grey  its 100 fresh still in my book
May 14 2015,positive,finally someone decided to use simple logic and created a master piece only fault is not to watch it in 3d could have created more 3d effects to make it more outstanding nevertheless a must watch
May 14 2015,positive,epic  one of the best movies ive seen for awhile
May 14 2015,positive,cars heavy metal explosions breast milk
May 14 2015,positive,movie if the year thus far
May 14 2015,positive,one of the best action movies i have ever seen
May 14 2015,positive,how about this for a treat  an unnecessary sequel that is actually very good surprisingly so in fact george miller continues his franchise in exhilarating style the lead this time round being played by tom hardy from beginningtoend its literally edgeofyourseat stuff from highoctane action to deathdefying sequences theres no clutter or excess the film trimmed to perfection  never are you given time to regain your breath or feel that the pace has been amateurishly slowed thats not to say this is a mindless actionfilm  because its not all the existential hopelessness of the previous offerings are on show with an intriguing enough story be it simple miller presents a world that has truly gone bad left to decay forgotten slightly more glossier with todays modern technology the australian visceral quality the rawness also is evident throughout just incase fans were worried it may have been watered down and the film makes no attempt to stray from moments of sheer darkness and subversiveness at times quite shocking there are plenty of creative original ideas at work yes this is not hollywood the true star of the piece is charlize theron as furiosa  so much so hardys max practically gets reduced to a sideshow hardy no doubt does look good in the central role surprisingly but he unfortunately fails to match the sheer and far superior desolate emptiness that mel gibson portrayed he has none of the iconic cold lonewarrior stance which propelled the character in so many peoples minds millers stylistic filmmaking interestingly is intact considering how long its been since hes done a film of this sort but the edge he once possessed has gone  for all the good fury road does its not a mark on the first two in the franchise there are some flashback sequences especially near the beginning of the film that are slightly offkey and weak but all that saidanddone this is a surprising success a rarity in todays corporate climate of garbage political correctness and continual rehashes explosive and fresh mad max fury road is not to be missed
May 14 2015,positive,brilliant basically a remake of mad max 2 only thing letting it down is speeded up action this isnt the 70s
May 14 2015,positive,very action packed no cgi so everything looks awesome and legit story line in terms of acting leaves something to be desired  but the action keeps the story moving enough that it works
May 14 2015,positive,it just wasnt that great it tried to be too gritty in the beginning which didnt get on well likely there were other corny parts that just culminated in its ultimate failure
May 14 2015,positive,my score for this film this 4810 george miller just made fast and furious look like a bunch of idiots the film offer all you need madness and stunning
May 14 2015,positive,it was great movie came me interested the whole way though
May 14 2015,positive,amazing visuals and non stop action
May 14 2015,positive,one hell of a soundtrack outstanding visuals and overthetop actionscenes unfortunately hardly any dialogues and hardly a good story this movie will work way better in cinema then watching it at home though
May 14 2015,negative,there is actually nothing good about this movie no story no context dialogue dubbed because they sped up the rest of the movie to make the sequences work the whole movie is one big uturn with the only addition of some eye candy of the wives the whole thing is pointless and worse than dracula untold
May 14 2015,positive,my friends blue mitsubishi magna pulled over and parked in the middle of the crinkled white painted lines of the parking lot adjacent to the cinema at exactly 930 pm    racing through the cold australian air yes we have winter here to the warm haven within the sliding doors my friend and i glanced to our left and saw the mad max fury road poster aligned inside the window we looked at each other with gleeful cheek as our feet carried us through the doors and up to the online ordering preference line to pick up our tickets    after my friend had ordered his regular  a large buttered popcorn and a frozen coke  we walked up the ramps and down the hallway until we came to the luxury cinema where our film mad max was just beginning     finally obtaining two empty seats near the back rows we plonked ourselves down with an audible sigh as the last advertisement for car insurance blared across the screen    that was the last sigh of boredom i uttered throughout the two hours and fifteen minutes that proceeded it    the cinematography is top notch george miller shows true form through the use of almost every facet at his disposal this isnt just a good dystopian film this is a masterpiece of cinema    miller calls upon the classic filmmaking techniques from old using images to tell his story instead of dialogue an almost lost art in this universe of fast pace action and dialogue heavy drama his style and technique trumps even the most dangerous of storytelling hiccups that would normally befall a dialogue lite film     the titular character max whos face we see for the first time at the forty minute mark has little dialogue to speak of but his actions speak volumes of his character as the story develops tom hardy owns max like a favourite leather jacket thats been worn constantly for thirty years     struggling with his inner demons he misshapenly falls in with furiosa an oil and milk tanker driver trying to find redemption from her past and a way to save four young women from the clutches of the villain of millers masterpiece immortan joe a real bad dude whose bite is far worse than his bark    along the way they come across nux nicholas hoult who provides the right amount of crazy and enough redemptive spirit to showcase a range of character rarely touched upon for a supporting cast     their characters develops at a safe and well crafted pace as their stories begin intertwining to form a compelling and interesting narrative that will surely be seen as a classic for generations to come    mad max fury road is a must see for anyone interested in either compelling narrative perfectly executed action sequences classic cinema or all of the above    1510 would watch again    and again    and again
May 14 2015,positive,2015 has so far been not only a bad year for films but also a soul crushing one as scores of mediocre and bad films were praised and financially rewarded so is this the end of great blockbusters which are attentively detailed aesthetically unique packed with good character arcs emanating strong messages    not if 70 year old george miller has anything to say about it fury road will go down in history as an instant classic viewing of it must be mandatory for any aspiring filmmaker or artist in general george has managed to boil the action genre down to its purest essence which is to show clarity and fluidity of motion ironically by doing so he has also elevated the genre into a higher form of art     tom hardy is the definition of screen presence flanked by the equally if not more captivating charlize theron if scores and scores of bad films is the condition for having a gem like this once in a while then ill have to be mad not to take it
May 14 2015,negative,theres only one negative review here now theres two   im an aussie and i find most aussie films childishempty and devoid of any intelligence this one was no different i expected much more as i thoroughly enjoyed and loved the original max films which is saying something for me  i like to be entertained orat leastshocked when i go to the movies and this did neither i totally agree with the other negative reviewer and thank god someone else didnt like it yes it was visually stunning but thats the beginning and end i dont understand all the hype and incredible praise for this movie   what is it about people that they are quite content to sit and watch 2 hours of mayhemnoise and confusion with no storyno script and no intelligence was there a plot i think so who is mad max and why is he mad how do we know if we havent seen the originals theres a whole generation who havent even heard of mad max mel gibson whos that     at least it was a bit better than wolf creek the worst movie of all time
May 14 2015,positive,nonstop action and very entertaining  best action movie of the decade
May 14 2015,positive,a nonstop action thrill ride that must be experienced in the theater they dont make movies like this anymore
May 14 2015,positive,enjoyed myself thoroughly this is one of the best if not the best action movie ive ever seen in the end the movie actually made me wanting to see more of the high octane car action chases this is actually my first mad max and id love the mythos  and the entire post apocalyptic world george miller have created i guess its time for me to see the other 3 mad maxs  this is the best action carchase movies ive seen thus far
May 14 2015,positive,what a day what a lovely day
May 14 2015,positive,what a day what a lovely day for fans of good ol pedaltothemetal action movies you may think that after 30 years the mad max franchise and with it action pioneer george miller wouldve become rusty but with tom hardy as the mad max 20 and charlize theron as imperator furiosa the director proves that his enginge is still running as loud and brutal as 30 years ago  and even though the present technology allows for a lot of computer generated spectacles miller fortunately relied mostly on practical awesomeness cars are flipping guys and badass chicks are jumping around and fire dominates the screen when max and a lot of asskicking ladys are not killing and trying to escape from crazy guys with explosive sticks the movie takes its time to tell a story about furiosas plan where max got caught up in between only long enough to make us care about each character before the mindblowing action fest continues  if all this doesnt already turns your blood into gasoline then the drum and industrialheavy soundtrack will make sure of it  all in all mad max fury road is a big achievement in action movie history and sets the tone for the rest of the blockbuster season
May 14 2015,positive,its insane mad and full of fury after decades of an absence from film mad max returns to steal the show at the movies with a nonstop heartthumping adrenalinefilled film that is unrelenting from start to finish
May 14 2015,positive,a fake happy ending    i liked it    north americans dont like sad endings so miller had to disguise the sad ending    they tried to scape from shit but had to return to the shit and fight for the shit where almost everybody have cancer and gonna die    the tyrant died yes but in the ending other people rise for the power and the alienated people themselves acclaimed their new rulers the social structures have not changed    there is no way out of the wasteland    who killed the world   fukushima     the seeds in the grannys bag represent hope  but theres no hope in the wasteland  the only one who understood this has left the city in the end
May 14 2015,positive,epic masterpiece it was an honor to have worked on this film well worth the long wait
May 14 2015,positive,im going to be harsh despite its general excellence the demise of the villains felt empty and the climax wasnt as grand a display as i was expecting of course my expectations likely negatively impacted on my overall enjoyment of this movie however it felt almost incomplete as if it were somewhat holding back this was nonetheless a great movie and i would see it again with generally great acting performances and an entertaining ride it is also refreshing to not have every plot point explained to us this movie may go down as a classic one day and is a great action movie but i hesitate to call it the best or even one of the best action movies that i have seen
May 14 2015,positive,so little dialogues and overall story but wow bombastic action and super great soundtrack
May 14 2015,positive,a breathtaking mind blowing masterpiece
May 14 2015,positive,amazing film would see again for sure
May 14 2015,positive,with vibrant and exhilarating action scenes dazzling cgi and a strong plot to follow suit mad max is pure entertainment
May 14 2015,positive,and this ladies and gentlemen is how you make a movie
May 14 2015,positive,george millers updates his mad max franchise for this generation taking full advantage of the digital process the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous and the action scenes make fast and the furious look dated   highly entertaining the film does struggle with the plot and a poorly written max
May 14 2015,positive,arent action films awesome 2015 started well with a great action film furious 7 which was unique and unforgettable heres another action film that has plenty of words to describe it mad max fury road is a true action movie that will be on top with the classics the matrix mad max 2 die hard speed and the fast and the furious franchise director george miller brings back his wonderful postapocalyptic adventure after 30 years since mad max beyond thunderdome he created family movies after mad max he wrote and produced the successful 1995 best picture nominee babe wrote produced and directed its lovable sequel babe pig in the city and wrote and directed the academy award winner for best animated feature of 2006 happy feet    mad max is way beyond those family movies by miller george miller is at his best the movie takes place in a distant future in the desert max rockatansky a stellar tom hardy replacing mel gibson in the lead role is scared by visions of his lost child and captured by immortan joe a wonderful hugh keaysbyrne who also played the evil toecutter in the first movie an evil tyrant who controls his people by using their water supply    joe has an army of men their are bald covered in white paint and use breast milk as radiation but his most trusted warrior is a woman named furiosa an outstanding charlize theron in possibly the role of her career furiosa then betrays joes rules and takes his five wives played by incredible performances by rosie huntingtonwhiteley zoe kravitz abbey lee courtney eaton and riley keough which leads to a nonstop chase that is packed with explosions sandstorms car crashes and more one of the war boys nux an amazing nicholas hoult wants to earn immortan joes respect and has a great insane voice nux also says a phrase that is so great oh what a day what a lovely day max is then on his car for blood transfusion and he escapes and meets furiosa and decides to help her for revenge against immortan joe     the films cast was wellacted tom hardy is way better than mel gibson as max even if he doesnt talk a lot his best role was as bane in the dark knight rises but max rockatansky tops it nicolas hoult played many lovable characters in movies jack in jack the giant slayer r in warm bodies and hank mccoybeast in the hit xmen movies first class and days of future past but nux in my opinion is the most lovable of them all hugh keaysbyrne went from playing the toecutter to immortan joe a more powerful and better villain the best performer in the movie is charlize theron shes brave enough to to shave her head have a left mechanical arm in the movie and is pretty tough and unforgettable and a legend from her oscar winning role in monster to her nominated role in north country and blockbuster roles in snow white and the huntsman and prometheus theron is a revelation all the time i fell in love with her role as furiosa she is definetly one of the worlds greatest actresses     george miller should also be known as one of the worlds greatest directors he sure does know how to make great movies not counting happy feet two miller writes produces and directs with gratitude the australian director is a genius miller used a 150 million budget to create this landmark of an action movie     with help from the fantastic cinematographer john seale rain man dead poets society harry potter and the sorcerers stone and the english patient his wife margaret sixel helps with the film editing as she did with happy feet and babe pig in the city and a stunning visual effects crew and well done stunt performers and cowriters brendan mccarthy and nico lathouris miller is back and better than ever    packed with car chases all the way through explosions action stunts people playing the drums and a mad man playing his guitar as the action happens mad max fury road is nirvana for movie lovers george millers postapocalyptic franchise is at its best it isnt just the best action movie of the year so far its also the years best film so far mad max fury road is a true action classic that will be loved for generations i love it
May 14 2015,negative,just plain silly not tough very little plot or character development what a steaming pile of breast milk   the cars look cool though   very disappointing overall
May 14 2015,positive,i watched it 3 days ago and i can still taste it i need to see this again
May 14 2015,positive,i have a prediction mad max is going to be a huge influence on action movies in the next few years in the same way as the matrix and 300s style changed the look of every action movie following them the next round of great action movies is going to be all car chases practical effects explosions no dialogue and quick zooms on faces and i for one cannot wait
May 14 2015,positive,it has one slow section in the movie to allow you to catch your breath but the flaming guitar maestros riding into battle and insane characters doing crazy stunts on swinging trapeze needles and throwing explosive tipped spears at metal spiked cars is everything you hoped it would be and more my favorite action movie ever
May 14 2015,positive,to the guy who oked the idea of giving a 70 year old a bunch of money to go to africa and smash the everloving fuck out of some cars good call
May 14 2015,positive,man what a movie where the heck do i start it was a non stop adrenaline rush from start to finish it is rare to see such precision in every aspect of film making i can absolutely find no fault in this one from the acting to the cinematography to the extremely fitting kick ass musical score to the mind blowing special effects with limited cgi seen onscreen wow the plot is kept simple and what a wise decision that was no need for multiple twists and subplots that only serve to muddle the story line no unnecessary love angles that seem to be a requirement for action movies these days theres no need to add elements to make the film more attractive to a broader audience if youre not into action movies this movie makes it clear that it is best you stay away because this movie isnt for you it is a no nonsense action movie which makes no apologies nor excuses and it means business basically the entire movie is one long chase sequence and its amazing how it can fit so many allegories in the simplest of plots and its also amazing how there are no cardboard cut out characters here even those with minor roles have their characters fleshed out theres even no need for a lengthy exposition or backstory for each character even for the main protagonists even if we are dropped straight into their world without much explanation for its existence wed never feel lost and thats a testament to the talents of the writers of this movie and the actors you see onscreen no wonder critics across the board are raving about this movie thats right even snooty critics couldnt get enough of a summer blockbuster movie if you are an action movie fan you will definitely love this
May 14 2015,positive,to see this movie in 3d is like going to a thrill park and have a few awesome rides plus some cool narrative to have a satisfying lovely day lol  it has it all  relentless action  check  believe or not at least one 3d deep character performance check charlize theron with a worthy best actress oscar nomination performance and also tom hardy who has only a few lines but still a worthy mel gibson successor  believe or not compelling narrative check  awesome cinematography  check oscar deserving in my view  awesome direction check george miller who already has won an oscar in animation he now deserves one for a live feature     i also believe than contrary to public perception this film is not just for boys but also for ladies too as charlize and other actresses have heroic performances here only keep in mind that it has r rating
May 14 2015,positive,mad max fury road its a piece of art
May 14 2015,positive,spectacular real stunts crashes  explosions real hardcore female characters really good fun d
May 14 2015,positive,visually gorgeous action packed but missing the charisma that mel gibson used to bring to max
May 14 2015,positive,just totally awesome  an uncompromising assualt on all senses  full highoctane action with unbelievable camera work and hypercative editing
May 14 2015,positive,in the end i was impressed by everything except tom hardys accent he begins as an australian turns a little british then towards the end hes full blown american it really took me out of the movie nicholas hoult was my favourite character in this for sure
May 14 2015,positive,witness the majestic world of golden sand and rusted steel mad max fury road is a nonstop concerto of clanking iron broken bones and splattering blood while fire squirts from all cylinders its absolutely glorious as far as scifi world goes director george miller creates a remorseless realm with every bit of nastiness present the two leading actors tom hardy and charlize theron are utterly convincing so much so audience would believe they are actual occupants of the unapologetic postapocalyptic world     max tom hardy is a survivor in a barren wasteland hes about to cross path with totalitarian clan war boys led by a dictator as luck would have it he meets with imperator furiosa charlize theron as situation escalates rapidly and they must fight for their survival tom hardy looks physically menacing and exhausted by the burden he carries on the desolate landscape he is more of an antihero who prioritizes his safety in the expense of his morality    charlize theron is utterly splendid with short hair and one arm she still manages to look beautiful and presentably strong she seems cold yet also rigidly determines to her cause this is a real rendition of a powerful female character not a model shoehorned into the wilderness nicholas hoult as nux one of the war boys is a chameleon his character might have the most development as a lowly peon who gradually discovers the true nature of his clan     production value is exceptionally well done from vehicles makeup and even prosthetic limbs all of them look as though they have wear and tear from the dusty world strange contraptions and weapons are aplenty explosive spears are thrown with reckless abandon as large tank mounted with electric guitar rumbles in the background its brazenly unworldly and overthetop spectacle there is no such thing as too much here     visual is all shades of tangerine the vistas look dry and dirty yet still can be lively or solemn as the filter regularly changes the soundtracks blast rock metal and techno vibe with each scene it truly doesnt let up riding the momentum from start to finish though its not just mindless explosion its characters are identifiable audience would be fascinated and cheer for them between each explosions     never a murky world ridden with death and destruction seems so irresistibly invitingly as the characters ride through the carnage the film is an achievement in action and destruction
May 14 2015,positive,i went to see this film tonight and it feels like im still watching it its the best one yet and i cant believe theyre making another one
May 14 2015,positive,once upon a time mad max was an 80s franchise with late 70s roots that lived and died without no compromises over its outlandish plots and settings thirty years later the third sequel in the franchise is here to school super hero movies and the other modern blockbusters on how to make less seem like more how to embrace difference and the outspoken mad max fury road comes to us in a time when we are in desperate need for something different     i cant explain this properly so here is a simple statement mad max fury road is a masterpiece of blockbuster cinema treat yourself and go watch it
May 14 2015,positive,everything youve ever wanted from a mad max sequel this movie will hopefully set the standard for future hollywood blockbusters when it comes to doing fx and stuntwork practically over shooting on a greenscreen and adding it all in digitally afterwards and for a movie with more action over story it leaves a lot to be discussed in great detail
May 14 2015,positive,epic madness will be going back for more
May 14 2015,positive,very intense and action packedan all around enjoyable film
May 14 2015,positive,tom hardy and charlize theron do not accept anything less than perfection in making a movie based on the on screen tension between charlize and tom hardy  this is going to be one real crazy ride
May 14 2015,positive,just like the trailer this movie is awesome a great action movie
May 14 2015,positive,one of the best action films i have seen in years i have to give this film four and a half stars despite its full fivestar quality due to its simplistic script one may call it minimalist but i think that such simplicity is definitely intentional for the sake of the action setpieces simply put fury road is a catandmouse race full of awesome heroes and villains spectacularly choreographed action sequences but without any character development in which the roles and characteristics of all the racers are set at the very beginning with only slim backstory and some slight twists along the race the premise of this film is really similar to children of mens with an even stronger metaphoric emphasis on the matriarchy and the essential role of woman in human history but less complexed situations or twistandturn but does that matter no absolutely not firstly the film succeeded in not betraying its incredible trailer a feat that not many films were able to accomplish in recent years fury roads trailer reminds me of zack snyders sucker punch  intense stylistic vengeful and with a unique style of postapocalyptic fantasy but whereas sucker punch did suck in delivering such premise pun intended fury road in full is even more furious than its trailer and admirably appears with its own thirsty ambiance ruddy environment postapocalyptic background without any lengthy voiceover explanations one can tell that the director was able to achieve such amazement since he had done three such films before i cannot tell because i have not watched any of them or could not remember watching them before  i was only amazed finding out that this is the same director of  happy feet and this is the film pure action film that he directed after thirty bloody years but nevertheless such unique look and style are really really a treat to the audiences eyes with amazing details after amazing details from the crazilyprimped cars to the metaphoric appearance of the characters this film definitely deserves to be watched on big screen imax preferably for thorough appreciation  the 3d effect of this film is not really standing out though strange since george miller actually recommended audience to watch this postproduction3dconverted film in 3d the simple storyline and heroic awesomeness of the protagonists which means not much place for contemplation or inner struggle  this film does not need them anyway are delivered through spectacular highoctane action sequences i feel sorry not being able to find a better word to describe their beauty arranged with excellent tempo throughout the film seamlessly stitched together through short but muchneeded silence and peaceful moments even better than the choreograph and practical effects of the action sequences themselves is the superb score that successfully puts classical and metal soundtracks into an intense excellentlytimed and amazingly enough touching when needed due to its thin plot it will be a little bit difficult for the audience to retell the films story to others but every single one of those who have watched the film will definitely be able to tell how awesome and dominant charlize therons imperator furiosa was throughout the film euphorically and figuratively since this is the first film i have seen that is able to utilize therons wellknown super model build  i just read an interview of george miller and he did indeed choose theron partly due to her physical agility originated from her earlier ballet dancing which is essential for the action exactitude of this film to avoid any dangerous mishap  and of course theron did play action heroine before in aeon flux but the film is too forgettable to be considered as benchmark for her role in mad max even in comparison with the subtler tom hardys mad max as impressive as her own name imperator furiosa might be one of the best action heroines of hollywood this decade alongside with emily blunts rita vrataski from edge of tomorrow not satisfied with that giant and effective pair of protagonists the director still gave enough space for the minor characters to shine and shine indeed they did from the crazy but gradually likeable nicholas hoults nux to the victoria secret queens who despite their limited true onscreen time and restraint roles of being beautiful still have their own shining moments especially riley keoughs queen capable capable indeed she was in comparison the antagonists were less built and appeared more generic and even a little bit disappointing especially the bosslike ones but they are nonetheless memorable for their fantastic outfits and some strange but iconic sequences if not for the expensive price of the imax ticket i really want to go back to the cinema to immerse myself in fury roads aweinspiring soundtrack and watch the breathtakingly iconic scenes that are normally reserved for epic historicalwar films yes in a way this is a true epic action film if i may say and not those pretentious marvel films of which no superheroines well they have only one so far can be compared with the oneandonly true heroine imperator furiosa i doubt that warner bros can retain this effective style for their upcoming dc movieverse given a wasandalwayswillbe pretentious zack snyder i can write longer and longer about this beloved film but really this is a cinema experience and highquality entertainment that the audience deserves love this film yes i love this film
May 14 2015,positive,go see it then see it again
May 14 2015,positive,not actually as amazing as everyone keeps saying character issues although probably just bad acting either that or bad directing but still fun and worth seeing
May 14 2015,negative,really really had high hopes for this movie been a huge fan of the franchise since i was a kid hopelessly disappointed in the reboot and george miller this movie isnt mad max its just a post apocalyptic movie with a cameo of the character mad max
May 14 2015,positive,awesome to the max  cirque du soleil in action

May 13 2015,positive,an absolute vehicular warfare masterpiece stunning visualsbest looking movie of the year by far great world building that left me wanting more and the action my god was just batshit insane charlize theron steals every scene she is in as furiosa and tom hardy is great at portraying a mentally scarred badass this might possibly be the best action movie this decade a
May 13 2015,positive,another note to self never overhype a film though mad max fury road is still great 8510 if i could     then again i was distracted by protecting my damn hearing junkie xl killed it bass knocked my plugs out my bloody ears
May 13 2015,positive,no story great action thats about it
May 13 2015,positive,crazy stunts and great visuals combine to make for one of the most fun times ive had a film in years
May 13 2015,positive,watching this film felt like drinking a six pack of red bull followed by drinking a six pack of monster energy then riding every roller coaster at a six flags amusement park for two hours
May 13 2015,positive,mad max is an absolute masterclass in worldbuilding steamrolling literally at a breakneck pace there isnt a dull moment in this quirky postapocalyptic car chase
May 13 2015,positive,oh what a film what a lovely film george millers mad max franchise is finally back after 30 years and its fueled with more energetically mad action than ever before full review 
May 13 2015,positive,imho mmfr is a spectacular action film  the butt kicking take no prisoner five women in this film makes the avengers look like little sizzy boys in tight leotards  incredible non stop action sequences is about 90 percent of the film but what a fun ride this is
May 13 2015,positive,what can i say about mad max fury road that has not already been said i have seen this film twice paid both times that should tell you something and during both instances i consistently enjoyed the time spend watch carnage and chaos flood the screen this is a haunting and beautiful film with stunning visuals and amazing scope watching my heroes literally fight their way to achieve their goal was a sight to see in an era where action stars rarely give off a sense of danger and uncertainty this is the best americanaction film that i have seen in a long long time do yourself a favor and get lost in george millers bizarre and unpredictable future because it makes an amazing moviegoing experience
May 13 2015,positive,instant classic one of the best action movies if not the best i ever seen in terms of the postapocalyptic theme the makeup and feel was awesome and over the top in a good way
May 13 2015,positive,what an adrenaline rush zero complaints here it deserves its current 99 fresh rating
May 13 2015,positive,awesome movie non stop action for two hours straight its a must see in the dbox your chair will be moving through out the entire movie
May 13 2015,positive,action movies today are plagued with a multitude of problems that confine them from great films from sequels and reboots overstuffed with prominent characters and special effects to having poorly written scripts and character development it just makes you want to stop watching these promising films altogether but then theres mad max    growing up mad max beyond the thunderdome 3rd in the franchise is the only film in the series i had any memory of watching i made sure to rewatch all 3 films leading up to the latest in the classic franchise the road warrior being my favorite prior to screening and i was ready to go by the time i hit the theater two hours of pure adrenaline and excitement later mad max fury road delivers a solid and insanely entertaining piece of movie making that rivals the greatest action heavy stunt films ever made    from its phenomenal cinematography perfectly timed score to its enriching postapocalyptic world fury road immerses viewers into a land of blood and metal playing out very much like a classic action film from an era that has passed us by the story sets up a simple enough premise to allow the audience to follow along and gasp with each near miss each dreaded moment and each triumphant achievement experienced by max and furiosa its truly an unforgiving and insanely fun film to watch unfold and by the third leg of the film youre invested enough to truly care about the fate of all parties involved and director george miller does not disappoint hardy and theron also deliver great performances as well as hoult with a menacing and ultimately touching performance one of the greatest things about fury road is that it plays out like a stand alone pulp fiction story with little connection to its predecessor while establishing its dominance especially in a time filled with so many franchises and over saturated genres      i expect this addition to the mad max franchise to join the pantheon of cult hits that the first three films have achieved and then some it is a film more than worthy of your time and will have many coming back for seconds in the series the film instantly became my favorite if youre going to see it find the theater with the absolute best sound quality and prepare to enter the world of mad max following him to redemption along fury road
May 13 2015,positive,oh my goodness this is the greatest action movies since the matrix do yourself a favor and go watch this

May 13 2015,positive,action packedbut
May 13 2015,negative,wtf saw this last night and all i can say is boring  plot is non existent   drive to one place to find something thats not there and then guess what turn around and drive home done crash another car hope nobody notices but they did  walking out the place was exhausted   from boredom
May 13 2015,positive,the whole movie was a 2 hour long nonstop adrenalinefilled unnecessarily extravagant turbocharged chase scene through the postapocalyptic desert in a word thrilling fury road delivers what weve been waiting 30 years for since mad max beyond thunderdome
May 13 2015,positive,slightly irritated max
May 13 2015,positive,hold onto your seats for a visual and visceral masterpiece    review on russelling reviews  
May 13 2015,positive,fast furious and completely insane my only complaint is that i actually wish it was longer because this ride goes by far too quickly
May 13 2015,positive,this is the movie michael bay wishes he could make
May 13 2015,positive,an absolute fury of a ride from front to back millers best movie thus far mayhem is the best word to describe this reincarnation reinvention and rebirth of mad max
May 13 2015,positive,mad max fury road is george millers return to the franchise he started way back in 1979 with mad max i will start by saying this movie was absolutely batshit insane it was filled right to the brim with continuous over the top bloody ridiculous action sequences that keep you on the edge of the seat and just amazed at what is happening on screen now this film doesnt have much of a plot at all but seriously youre not going into this film for an intense plot this is a film that almost didnt even need one at all the one thing i was worried about going in was whether i needed to have seen the previous films to understand this one and thankfully you dont the story is independent of the previous film which was really helpful     the characters were all awesome and it did an amazing job to introduce them all almost instantly and get right into the action max tom hardy and furiosa charlize theron were were great and extremely likeable characters even the villain who i will just call sweet tooth was so great he wasnt anything too special but was a great threat throughout the film     i just absolutely loved this movie intense action from start to finish and didnt slow down at all that made it ridiculously fun to watch the great characters and the performances are awesome on screen and were always interesting to watch if there was ever a twisted metal movie this is what it would be nothing really let the film down and everything really worked such a great time and the best cinema experience this year so far  10
May 13 2015,positive,dont let the nonstop adrenalinefueled action distract from the understated wellwritten story and characters at hand
May 13 2015,positive,empowerment redemption hope and gasoline one hell of a ride
May 13 2015,positive,the story was weak but its a good time acting is good and special effects are awesome pretty cool action scenes feels like a gritty graphic novel
May 13 2015,negative,dont get me wrong the cinematography is pretty cool weird but cool but the whole movie is an over glorified car chase with the occasional reminder about an apocalyptic social construct
May 13 2015,positive,george miller is a legend cant wait for the next film
May 13 2015,positive,simply put the sleeper action movie of the year a true instant classic nobody can make action like george miller canif youre an action buff go out and see this immediately  d
May 13 2015,positive,its one hell of a fun ride
May 13 2015,positive,a freakin must see
May 13 2015,positive,the best action movie ive ever seen and ive seen quite a few
May 13 2015,positive,a masterwork of visual storytelling fury road tells its exciting satisfying tale with intense emotional action very little dialogue and almost no exposition its been so many years since i saw the original trilogy that the only things i really remember are mel gibsons hair and sand  because fury road was meant to stand alone theres no need for the audience to know all of the nuances of the mad max mythology to appreciate or understand the story here  this is a long chase movie but its also a legend about a man who has lost it all been driven mad and has to find his way back to himself  see the movie for the story the characters and for the feeling of immersion into this wasteland of a world
May 13 2015,positive,why cant hollywood make movies like this one anymore is it so much to ask oh yeah i seen it three times already go see it now
May 13 2015,positive,wow wow wow a heavy metal spectacle of eyecandy action like ive never seen before i liked this much better than expected
May 13 2015,negative,meh this was obviously made for the oldtime fans   its land before time for adults best part was the tribe of lady elders but ultimately not worth the time or money
May 13 2015,positive,impossible to overstate how great this movie is saw it monday and still have its imagery crossing my thoughts start to finish its spectacular you couldnt have convinced me that miller would top the road warrior but here it is
May 13 2015,positive,if you are into just pure actionviolence and no story then this is for you the battle scenes are intense but sadly max the main character used to say a lot more lines in the original series than in this flick
May 13 2015,positive,way better than those boring nascar races 
May 13 2015,positive,what a movie what a lovely movie
May 13 2015,positive,everything i wanted it to be epic i cant wait to see it again
May 13 2015,positive,hey max this is supposed to have u as a main character maybe u are waiting for the sequel    enjoyed
May 13 2015,positive,full review coming soon this is a landmark blockbuster movie alongside star wars indiana jones aliens die hard terminator 2 the matrix crouching tiger hidden dragon and the dark knight im not spoiling it see this movie
May 13 2015,positive,a mindnumbingly homage to the road warriorstrap yourself in and brace yourself for everything
May 13 2015,positive,the most insane action movie you will see until the next one
May 13 2015,positive,gorgeous intense disturbing and imaginatively told charlize theron is tough as nails
May 13 2015,positive,as of right now its the best movie of the year not as good as happy feet two though thats george millers best movie 2nd best is babe pig in the city then i guess this is his 3rd best
May 13 2015,positive,truly insanity at its best
May 13 2015,positive,was a good balance of action and story people who dont necessarily like action films will probably enjoy it also
May 13 2015,positive,with everything from explosive car chases to crazy flameshooting guitars to the girl you forgot you saw in that one transformers movie this movie brings a ton fun to the table and certainly does not disappoint
May 13 2015,positive,fast over the top action
May 13 2015,positive,loved this movie had the look and feel i expected from a mad max movie absolutely loved all the crazy vehicles and characters tons of crazy stunts all action here all very well done in my opinion  i arrived at the movie tired and left exhilarated  a must see for any fan of the original road warrior
May 13 2015,neutral,it should have been called furiosa instead of mad max
May 13 2015,positive,exciting thrill ride with tons of action
May 13 2015,positive,talk about perfection
May 13 2015,positive,i knew nothing about the previous movie  had not interest in seeing this  not my kind of movie  well after seeing so many positive reviews i decided to give it a shot  glad i did  its far out that but the scenery and nonstop action is consuming  doesnt hurt that im a big tom hardy fan
May 13 2015,positive,the road warrior on steroidsat 70 george millers still got it this put ff to shame when the majority of the automotive action is real and im still not quite sure after seeing fr in 3d how tom hardy did not get seriously injured with some of the stuff he did all the action was searing and you can see cinematographer john seales fingerprint on everythingmiller and seale can truly shoot a real real action scene and put the camera in places it probably shouldnt be able to go one highlight for me was the uberdramatic phenomenally scored sandstorm scene with its flawless cgi integrationthe cgi is there but the seam is invisible this scene literally had me eyebrows raised and saying that storyboard mustve been fun to plan out the integration of the fx and the liveaction footage is truly at expert level sorry marvelbut you can always see the cgi in your movies and we always know where it starts and ends i simply cant say enough good things about mmfr but ill trytom hardy apparently signed on for 2 more mm installments under miller i cant imagine what miller has planned for us next but with george miller we should be ready for anything one thing that really sticks out for me is that for the viewing my wife and i went to last night was rather small our auditorium was only halffilled but after the last shot finished and directed by george miller appeared everybody at our showing clapped for a whole minutethat didnt happen at either avengers or f7 this movie has changed the action genre again but this time to a place where movies have never gonedirectors not wanting to shoot scenes the easy way but the best way most directors will incorporate the digital work for a whole list of reasonsgeorge miller takes that list burns it with a lighter and blows the ashes away with a leaf blower he doesnt use cgi to make it easy he uses it to turn the already jawdropping into the absolutely eyepopping using cgi so perfectly and so minimally you dont know where it is or how much there is you watch any superhero movie or ff movie and you can see where the digital work ishere dont even bother looking and thats where george miller takes us to a place where we know its there for about 2 seconds but we dont know where it started and finished and we dont care at all as good as f7 and avengers were there was a lot of areas they couldve been bettergeorge miller not only goes to that place but now he owns it and he doesnt have to give it back  with the technical aspect locked up in the hands of miller seale and crew the real reason to watch this is the magnetic chemistry of hardy and therona masterfully staged fight between max furiosa and nux quickly transforms into a reluctant partnership against immortan joe and his regime and they quickly adapt to whatever the situation brings especially when furiosa gets stabbed at the worst possible moment  their commitment is never to each other but to surviving and they both acknowledge that they are only resources to help that cause  max doesnt even tell her his name until shes almost deadbecause at no point does knowing his name help them on their journey that is until knowing him as a person more or less as well as his blood helps her to survive her injury  a small detail but pivotal to their relationship as it wasnt important until it became important  and enough cant be said about theron as furiosashe is this generations ripley a survivor who isnt afraid or too proud to take help when she needs it and above all will see her cause through to the end  theron truly owns the role when she agrees with max to head back to their compoundshe already offered to cement their partnership he goes one better and offers to go back to the citadel with them and help them retake it because now surviving isnt enough for either of themthey both seek redemption and they know they need each other to accomplish that  theron owns that scene going from completely defeated then willing to take the second path and finally agreeing with maxs suggestion because it still offers hope and she completes the 360 perfectly because she knows that furiosa has to complete her journey hardy and theron are the best onscreen pair ive seen in more than a decade and i really hope that miller has more for them to do together  this movie shouldve been an epic fail on so many levelsyet george miller looks at the odds laughs at them pushes them out of his way and blows them up in the first 15 minutes  or maybe that was maxs car
May 13 2015,positive,this mad max was visually incredible  i cant tell you how many times i muttered  woooo in the movie theatre  this is not a movie to be diminished on a small screen    rob zombieites victoria secret models monster trucks cirque de soleil and some ingenious mechanical stuff im still trying to wrap my mind around  my creative side has been intrigued and blown away   my emotional side has its arms crossed and looks ticked tho  there is no emotional connection in the least here but it certainly has enough crazy eye popping and jaw dropping shenanigans to keep you distracted from the lack of character development  but the crunching is completely worth it  go see it
May 13 2015,positive,this movie is way overhyped but it is indeed a good movie solid 8 out of 10
May 13 2015,positive,time has only improved this action masterpiece solidifying its perfection
May 13 2015,positive,great action with a lot of noncgi effects loved the creative artistic direction in all of the settings and costumes worth seeing in theaters
May 13 2015,positive,just watch this movies mashup with mad max star war antman   
May 13 2015,positive,fantastical intense and constantly in action  wonderfully exaggerated characters
May 13 2015,positive,its amazing this is why we still have movie theaters go see it on the biggest screen with the best sound system you can i dont remember breathing the whole time until th e very end
May 13 2015,positive,underneath the insanity lies a plethora of positive and progressive values a visual achievement and surprisingly an intellectual one
May 13 2015,positive,check out my score on a 110 scale here    
May 13 2015,positive,a maddening good time action packed with a surprising amount of drama guitar flamethrower is awesome and yes i know it sounds stupid
May 13 2015,positive,amazingly great film  action from beginning to end a must see
May 13 2015,positive,shit blew my mind an absolute masterpiece d
May 13 2015,positive,its a supercharged adrenaline rush from begining to end an almost surreal harmony of havok and a post apocalyptic cacophany of glorious carnage
May 13 2015,positive,awesome action photography and everything else
May 13 2015,positive,come for the action stay for theaction thats mostly all that is here with little bits of setup and character development in between just so that you know you watched a movie while it may be onesided that side is a highoctane ride that does not disappoint    edit after altering my expectation and watching this film again i have a much more favorable impression the sheer magnitude of the action set pieces is astounding i mean how do you film this movie it almost does not seem possible to film these huge action sequences in one take there is just so much going on review score increased
May 13 2015,positive,shockingly entertaining fun fight sequences that initially made me cringe but ended with me fist pumping should probably check out the other mad max films now
May 13 2015,positive,my friend declared this postapocalyptic burning man  design is gorgeous but only go if you really really like your fight scenes 994 fight scenes
May 13 2015,positive,simple yet straight to the point in terms of plot and giving fans great action in mostly noncgi effects mad max fury road delivers a great and hopefully not the last chapter in the mad max franchise that is on par with the road warrior my only knock off for this flick is that even though tom hardy delivers a good performance he doesnt deliver the charisma that mel gibson brought to the table in the previous films i know that its big shoes to fill for him and since there was definitely a note worthy effort delivered on hardys part that i am not going to knock it that much off but yes definitely go see it in the theater if youre a fan of the series if youre a fan of action movies in general you wont be disappointed
May 13 2015,positive,better than thunderdome but not quite road warrior decent watch for an afternoon out
May 13 2015,positive,the first 15 minutes kind of threw me because of the fast motion of the scenes bit other than that i thought it was good i think ill be up for the sequel
May 13 2015,positive,one of the best action movies ive seen in a while also its a great sequel to an amazing series
May 13 2015,positive,pure excitement i loved it so much i had to see it again the next day
May 13 2015,positive,this was actually a spectacular visual movie i didnt think it would be good as the original movie but the visuals were better good to see george miller still behind the production
May 13 2015,positive,my review in seven words    best action movie ever    im not exaggerating
May 13 2015,positive,what a lovely day perfect movie
May 13 2015,positive,relentless and over the top but still beautifully crafted mad max fury road is george millers triumphant return to the world he created and his two hour method of proving that he is indeed a mastermind
May 13 2015,positive,seems like an extended rock video great action sequences but kinda hollow worth seeing though
May 13 2015,positive,atypical day commuting in dc
May 13 2015,positive,solid plot amazing choreography and great attention to detail all make fury road a great update to george millers mad max saga

May 13 2015,positive,welcome back amazing series
May 13 2015,positive,wow fury road provides an exhilariting trip through the postapocalyptic desert that will impress and stun at every turn or explosion
May 13 2015,positive,everyone needs to see this movie 2d or 3d is unimportant just see it but keep in mind that miller opted to show it on 2d at the initial press screeningdebut and the 3d was added in post it is easily the best action movie ive seen in the last 20 years and puts the cgi and jump cutheavy mcu movies for example to shame mm4 is a shining example of what i love about the best action movies show dont tell and incredible practical effects
May 13 2015,positive,roadd furyyy the besttt
May 13 2015,positive,while it only just revs past retreading old territory miller returns more artful and full of adrenaline than ever before
May 13 2015,neutral,not since star wars the phantom menace have i fallen asleep at the cinema even the best of action scenes become dull when there is no buildup or change in pace
May 13 2015,positive,if youre into intense action and adventure mad max fury road is the movie for you see it on the biggest screen in your house and then crank up the dolbysurround sound to quote charlize theron see calls her character one badass bitch i couldnt agree more as she disproves the old adage that women are the weaker sex after two hours of this nonstop action you will need either cpr or two days at the beach if youre a big fan of  mad max spend the  extra bucks on the fivedisc mad max anthology a great christmas gift
May 13 2015,positive,awesome movie one of the best ive seen in a while
May 13 2015,positive,i saw the original in 1979 at the theaters and have watched it many time since so glad to see the reviewers here give it such a great rating i see a mad max 2 remake likely already
May 13 2015,positive,nonstop high octane turbo charged edge of seat super action from start to end
May 13 2015,positive,what a day  what a lovely day    witness me
May 13 2015,positive,too goodtoo good the best max by far
May 13 2015,positive,phenomenal beats the original trilogy easily  charlize theron gives an oscar worthy performance
May 13 2015,positive,surprisingly great i need to see it again
May 13 2015,positive,the best action movie sincenot even sure full throttle action at a intense level will keep you on your toes at all times

May 13 2015,positive,one of best cinematic experiences of my life
May 13 2015,positive,best movie of the year so far
May 13 2015,positive,mindblowing visuals and thats the best thing about it i think the storys good and it eases some nice metaphors in there but this is just a nonstop visualbased action movie and you have to leave it at that george miller definitely has a specific vision he portrays very uniquely here and you got to hand it to the man for his bizarre visuals
May 13 2015,positive,an all out adrenaline rush from start to finish
May 13 2015,positive,oh what a lovely day  mad max fury road brings back george millers postapocalyptic franchise back and in magnificent style  not just one of the best movies of the summer but one of the best films of the year
May 13 2015,positive,insane and fun with an amazing look to it
May 13 2015,neutral,disappointing 5 out of 10 watched it all the way through wouldnt watch again even if on free tv
May 13 2015,positive,its very unlikely that anything will be more amazing than mad max this summer
May 13 2015,positive,this film was the fast and the furious on steroids  absolutely bananas  loved every second of this fast paced crazy ass post apocalyptic world
May 13 2015,positive,basically in every mad max the villains steal the show this remains true in this one what doesnt is the fuel wars  the less you consider the reasoning of the plot the better just enjoy the action and beautiful scenery
May 13 2015,positive,great flick  make plans this weekend to see tom hardy and charlize theron bring to life the postapocalyptic and insanity of mad max 
May 13 2015,positive,fantastic  this film is one of the best action films you will ever see  it might be the best in the mad max series aside from the road warrior which is a classic  i have to say though tom hardy plays a great mad max and charlize theron was an awesome choice for this film  i wouldnt mind seeing her in the next couple of mad max films if possible
May 13 2015,positive,awesomest bestest action blockbuster of summer 2015 avengers two had its funny parts  but as with all sequels youre mostly wanting more this reboot on the other hand blew me with the production script actors scenery and direction and guess what its a action movie where the lead actor dosent have to be smitten with his lead actress to sell the script whod have known they could make a movie without some romantic overtones thrown in for good measure loved it
May 13 2015,positive,unlike anything that you will see this year and likely will ever see
May 13 2015,positive,i think i came in the theatre
May 13 2015,positive,best action movie in decades
May 13 2015,positive,what a day what a lovely day i watched it in 4d came out of the theater and got right back into the line to buy a ticket for the next show unfortunately it was house full i will watch it every night from now on for a few days
May 13 2015,positive,this movie is incredible i believe it will be a timeless classic people will enjoy for decades if you have not seen this movie yet do yourself a favor and go watch it now
May 13 2015,positive,when my mom and her boyfriend saw this they say it is silly  you know what i think i think this shouldnt have been given a 98 rating thats way too high i dont think its that great and was not as good as i expect i like it a little bit but thats because of tom hardy there was no plot just explosions and best screening effects there was not much acting part 1 of this movie i feel like leaving the movie theatre because its just copying insurgent but i have seen 2 walk out my legs were shaking and shocked about seeing this movie i thought the rest of the movie would be horrible and just makes me wanna give up on the  rotten tomatoes website lets just focus on the positive things there are 3 what i heard is this was stunning and indeed a courage of dismandable filmmaking let me just tell you a few  the plot gone horribly wrong the story is all about action and the acting was really really good    score 710
May 13 2015,positive,such a great score such great action sequences and such an adrenaline rush charlize theron has the best moment in the movie when she says remember me i am glad this movie had the same director as the first three films that i watched all the time growing up
May 13 2015,positive,remarkable bizarre strangely claustrophobic charlize theron is super tom hardy works well and taken as a whole this is bonkers and compelling well worth seeing
May 13 2015,positive,exceptional in almost every way in terms of pure thrills spectacle theme character development not enough good things to say about this
May 13 2015,positive,this movie is epic the story is not that complicated but the visuals are breathtaking combine this with amazing stunts and great music and you have a pretty damn good movie
May 13 2015,positive,why isnt this the standard for the hollywood blockbuster
May 13 2015,positive,one of the greatest action films of this generation george miller finds the perfect balance of practical effects cgi female empowerment and insanity
May 13 2015,positive,awesome thrill ride from start to finish
May 13 2015,positive,best 2015 movie to date   one of my all time favourite action
May 13 2015,positive,good to see george miller back to making full on films again
May 13 2015,positive,i used to love charlize theoron after this one i holy freakin love her no spoilers this is furiosas movie not maxs which is probably why i felt a little underwhelmed because the start sequence of his capture and escape was most intriguing for me will have to visit the original trilogy to know more about him but still crazy action and the final return chase had me grabbing my seat with one hand and biting my fingers on the other its that much adrenaline keeping you on the edge nicholas hoult also deserves attention for his role as nux     my only disappointment is that i wanted to see more of tom hardy on acting terms hopefully his next one legend will make up for it with its double roles     this movie really invests in characters develops them enough that you want to know more and more of them even go and check out the prequels but there is something amiss for me i am not sure what story something else anyway let the rating not fool you this was one hell of a ride
May 13 2015,positive,very entertaining  i have really become a tom hardy fan  the action was pretty much non stop charlene theron was great as the heroine
May 13 2015,positive,with incredible and eye popping action set pieces practical stunts that will blow your mind away and a surprising amount of emotional heft in the film the fourth addition of the mad max series is a triumphant outing and return to form for director george miller insane as it is calculated this must be one of the best action films in a long time a decade even
May 12 2015,positive,mad max fury road still pumps my adrenaline after years of being bloated by highoctane superheroaction blockbusters in a nutshell fury road is a postapocalyptic odyssey in form of an epic car chase great practical effects and daring stunts quick but not irritable editing heartthumping score beautiful cinematography and george millers signature style polished and seasoned here all make this movie a fun ride the others are iconic but this one in my opinion stands on its own    highly recommend

May 12 2015,positive,there wont be a better action movie than this until the sequel i pray happens i never want this to stop insane shook me to the core
May 12 2015,positive,despite its sometimes overbearing eccentricities fury road is at its heart a genre piece there are no reservations about what the film is intended to do miller accepts his genre status elevates it and surges forward with aggressive selfconfidence the most interesting element of the film however is its surprising feminism with imperator furiosa a fearless charlize theron miller has crafted a strong female action hero who can hold her own in a masculine world the likes of which hasnt been seen since ellen ripley furiosa is not your average action movie tough girl as miller reveals her backstory and motivations theron is able to peel back layers of emotions that have been repressed for decades the result is a refreshingly androgynous hybrid between traditional feminine sentiment with masculine strength and by combining them miller subverts binary gender roles in favor of a less constricting representation of human strength and vulnerability
May 12 2015,positive,absolutely incredible mad max fury road is a testament to risk taking in hollywood warner bros and village roadshow gave a visionary george miller endless resources to make his dream a reality he delivered the best action movie in years its not easy to make bold decisions like this but props to wb  vr for risking it all on this one

May 12 2015,positive,mad max fury road is the best film of 2015 amidst a dream year for cineastes
May 12 2015,positive,george miller has said that the best version of his film is in black and white with no dialogue black  chrome is an attempt to realize millers alternate vision the cinematography the editing the sound design and the score are now represented in a completely new experience     warner bros may have removed the video by now though    contains some spoilers     i just watched mad max fury road how director george miller originally envisioned it being black and white with no dialogue this is my first time seeing fury road i missed it in theatres when the film was coming out and black and white trailer was released for it that made more sense to me for the setting of the flick honestly     i was able to follow the narrative from only the visuals with the exception of grasping all of imperator furiosas backstory that is i can kind of guess but i am still not 100 sure    from what i gathered shes someone of high command for immortan joe unlike other women being used for their milk or intercourse for the purposes of giving joe a son hence the words our sons will not be warlords along with we are not things she must be unable to bear a child and was forced to become useful by becoming more like a male crony for joe ie her appearance of having no hair which is what all of the members of joes men look like i wouldnt be surprised if her arm was was lost thanks to immortan joe initially either for her failures i mentioned earlier    furiosa represents not adhering to societal standards visually a woman with agency nor solely a love interest and a character with a disability all together yes excuse me as i go send george miller and charlize theron hundred of letters of thanks     all of the other women under joes tyranny wore dresses of some kind whilst furiosa did not reinforcing my belief of her becoming more malelike as she worked for joe that gained her a high ranking in the process not since ripley from alien has there been such a cool character that outshines more like steals the entire show from the titular max    on top of that the wives arent exactly damsels in distress some of them help out eventually furiosa and max get assistance from other women of varying ages including older you hardly see that and color which kick as much as butt as they do this was something i was sooooo happy to observe      the fury road character of nux is another fascinating addition to the motion picture id be remiss not to type about his arc is one of being worthy of going to valhalla by dying as a man besides max hes the lone other prominent male nonantagonist character he himself is dying utilizing max as a blood bag before joining them hes very childlike but with furiosa and max and the wives his personality and character matures    fury road is an actionpacked ride that rarely has any stops during it director miller gives some characterization sandwiched in between all of that as well the vehicles have tons of personality what more do you want these moments would probably be stronger with dialogue but i believe i got the gist of the majority of them it isnt perfect yet it all works rather well currently my top cinematic experience of this year with mission impossible rogue nation right behind it    hrm i should view the one with dialogue next i think or would that ruin the impact of millers original vision uncertain now
May 12 2015,positive,it was weird but good theron and hardy were good but still like age of ultron better
May 12 2015,positive,this movie melted my face off the action was beautiful and everything felt as if it was done for a reason
May 12 2015,positive,not much dialog but the story and drama is riveting the acting is top notch and this is a truly great remake great fun at the cinema
May 12 2015,positive,eye popping edge of your seat action sequences theron  hardy are 110 invested in this spectacular reboot
May 12 2015,positive,for what it is its pretty much perfect personally straight up action movies arent my favorite movies but i still enjoyed the hell out of it
May 12 2015,positive,pure adrenaline and action
May 12 2015,positive,the best movie of 2015 hands down and the most fun i had all year
May 12 2015,positive,loved the action but there wasnt a ton to the plot
May 12 2015,positive,bane from the dark knight rises falls in love
May 12 2015,positive,quite a bit of action and special effects lacks the characters of the second and third mad max mivies
May 12 2015,positive,easily my favorite movie the year i cannot anticipate any movie unseating it and to be honest its now set the bar so high that it will probably blunt my enjoyment of merely good action flicks     why is this the case well fury road hit the rare combination of novelty familiarity joy pathos drama comedy absurdity realism and the balance between actioncharacter and story that to me is the paradigm of what a modern action movie can and should achieve     it toys with cliches and tropes then averts most of them then sometimes averts then fulfills one just to keep you guessing since my major complaint with most action films is that they become cliched to the point of utter predictability this change was insanely welcome rather than a bythenumbers action flick fury road almost rewrites the book and action is the name of the game once the convoy kicks off its a near constant stream of action sequences or brief transitions and setups for action sequences whilst i might have expected given that the film is essentially one long car chase things would get repetitious miller is mart enough to variegate the focus of the events and since miller is apparently the guru of unique action scenes he offers forth a smorgasbord of options in one scene theres suicide jumps onto cars covered in spikes while holding explosives in another theres two people one of whom is chained to an unconscious guy fighting over a shotgun    so just know that youll get your adrenaline fix from this film but naturally you want to know about the performances too    id expected that either charlize theron or tom hardy would end up oneupping the other in the acting department but while theron probably wins on technicality she has far more lines and a broader range of emotions so her talent is showcased more the ultimate outcome of their chemistry is a joy to behold as intimated by the opening narration max is driven by the singular instinct to survive at all costs he is not looking to save anyone but himself this point is driven home when he literally abandons a group of almostdefenseless not helpless mind you young women to an oncoming horde of barbarians under a warlord looking to reclaim them    yes he eventually has a change of heart another hour into the movie a movie that dares to let one of its protagonists behave completely selfishly is a rare thing and it makes the overall character arcs stronger and on the other side the movie manages to make almost every character including the villains sympathetic to some degree sorta immortan joe is no doubt a psychotic dictator but the movie bothers to delve into his motivations and show that he is wellintentioned and is not simply in this for kicks and the core example of this is nux who is introduced as a healthcompromised warboy who lives only to serve joe and to die gloriously his repeated failure is a source of serious comedy but his reaction to his failure is what drives the pathos of the second and third acts and really drives home the pointlessness of existence in these wastelands     so youre going to get action youre also going to get emotionally attached to at least some of these characters which naturally raises the stakes and the film is tense too as mentioned it retains its unpredictability by flouting or avoiding cliches and thus the outcome of any particular conflict is never certain the life of a given character is always in the balance so when you get an establishing shot of a massive convoy of vehicles in pursuit of protagonists there is a serious dread implied by the chance that they might catch up    aside from that youve got the extensive use of practical effects the amazing understated worldbuilding the judicious editing and the incredible soundtrack to back up all of the above    anyhow to avoid gushing about every single frame of the movie ill just say that it amazes me that this movie was made and further amazes me that it was as good as it was completely blowing my expectations out of the water hopefully it can help impact hollywood for the better and push for some seriously new ideas    all in all its hard to imagine someone not liking this film unless they just dont enjoy action
May 12 2015,positive,this is one hell of a ride and i enjoyed every moment of it a simple story with traditional stunts and effects including memorable characters george miller is the badass director whom we love awesome job
May 12 2015,neutral,for petrol heads that is all
May 12 2015,positive,nonstop action fun and weirdness loved the score
May 12 2015,positive,i was blown away with how much action packed and how fast paced this movie was it was explosion after explosion and was pure fun it shows how crazy the world can become even though it had not much dialogue and plot it was just nonstop action sequences and as i said fun
May 12 2015,positive,mad max fury road is the best action movie since die hard and the only true liveaction action movie as opposed to computerized cartoon of the century so far holds up not just to george millers previous films but to alltime action classics like buster keatons movies wages of fear and aliens george miller has finally figured out what digital technology is for to shoot hundreds of hours of images from every conceivable angle and cut it into an organic coherent whole a triumph of traditional moviemaking the first viscerally exciting film in ages the best film ever to cost over 100m to make  it will be admired even more decades from now as the film that against all odds brought realityreal actors real action and real risks and rewardsback to pop broadaudience cinema
May 12 2015,positive,mad max is like riding a roller coaster you feel the adrenaline and excitement while youre watching it the visual effects are stunning and the action sequences are out of this world

May 12 2015,positive,i really dont see what all the hype was about if anything i found myself a bit bored towards the end however it was a good movie just not the greteast evar11 as some people were saying
May 12 2015,positive,this is one of the greatest movies i have ever seen  it holds up the mad max legacy and reiterates the genius of george miller  two warnings 1 this movie is obviously not for everyone and if it is oyu know who you are and 2 this movie is insane
May 12 2015,positive,after 30 years director george miller returns to the apocalyptic world of mad max with mad max fury a surprisingly epic addition to the postapocalyptic franchise mad max fury road blends action and narrative heft to create a chaotic but exhilarating masterpiece of postapocalyptic proportions
May 12 2015,positive,where do i even begin with this review perhaps with the fact that i was wrong about tom hardy stealing the show the whole cast steals the show and that is a sign of a great movie
May 12 2015,positive,entertaining yes visually amazing yes good action and cool style definitely  best movie of the year meh not in my opinion  best action movie ever not even by a long shot  im a huge fan of tom hardy and charlize theron and they were fun just like the movie  i do think it is a bit overrated if you want action from beginning to end yeah sure you get that but with basically no substance  it is a fun watch and i actually feel ill like it even better after a second viewing but cant help but feeling let down after all the hype
May 12 2015,positive,this movie will become the best action movie of the summer the characters stunts and visuals are quite amazing and this movie is on epic car chase that must be watched just sit back and enjoy this film
May 12 2015,positive,absolutely brilliant film

May 12 2015,positive,words can not explain how fun this movie is you are never bored and are always amused by the insane and perfectly edited action scenes mad max fury road is an unbelievably entertaining action film while there is not enough character development the movie is still a fantastic piece of work every action movie should follow the footsteps of this genius film

May 12 2015,positive,action movies arent really my thing but this was made exceptionally well
May 12 2015,positive,i down open another new mad max movie this sunday afternoon  with my dad
May 12 2015,positive,the first fifteen minutes doesnt do the film any favors frankly it almost killed what interest i had in the series  however if you can get past the films weak beginning and wait till max and furiosa finally meet thats where things get really good  past its few narrative flaws the film is one hell of a grand action movie with great characters to back it up
May 12 2015,positive,ridiculously awesome outlandish
May 12 2015,positive,beautiful piece of action the worthy continuator of the previous mad max series with all in it
May 12 2015,positive,what a lovely movie george miller comes back directing another mad max film and it might be the best one yet miller creates a colourful and vibrant yet dark crazy world in this artistic and action packed movie the camera work directs you toward the action while the beautiful backdrops may make you want to see in its beauty it seems that going beyond thunderdome will increase the quality of your movies this is a must see movie in 2015 so watch on
May 12 2015,positive,crazy full throttle insanity good
May 12 2015,negative,i just saw this in a prescreening if you have never seen any of the mad max films go see it you will love the action if you have seen any of the mad max films run cover your eyes and dont go near it i am a die hard max fan and really tride to see it with an open mind but it is completely unrealistic in almost every way i wont spoil it but if you want action here it is if you want story reality or continuity dont waste your timeplus they kill the car again  twice
May 12 2015,positive,as close as a movie can come to being nonstop action
May 12 2015,neutral,besides the chase scenes there is not much else to this film

May 12 2015,positive,movie was non stop intense always had something going every scene one of my favorite action movies all time now
May 12 2015,positive,this movie is an exhausting adrenaline rush punctuated by overthetop characters and situations rarely seen in blockbuster action films from start to finish theres an intensity that makes this movie a real edgeofyourseat nail biter go watch it now
May 12 2015,positive,this is a chase movie with a big budget i gave the original mad max a very low rating but this reboot is way better re445 its so different to other movies it deserves higher rating
May 12 2015,positive,if you thought the original mad max movies were crazy this is like those movies drank a six pack of red bull and snorted coke fury road is an insane highoctane actionpacked sequel and even with its nearly nonstop action it has a pretty interesting narrative if you are an action junkie fury road is sure to satisfy you and possibly more
May 12 2015,positive,best movie of 2015 so far an absolute jaw dropper from start to finish
May 12 2015,positive,george miller has saved action film in this unrelenting raw flawlessly directed film with frankly some of the most balls on the walls sequences ive ever seen
May 12 2015,positive,a little too weird for my taste but a great movie nonetheless
May 12 2015,positive,awesome mad max all vehicular chase and gun fighting tom hardy and charlize nail the post apocalyptic grittiness with their harsh portrayals of brutal survivalists who are saddled with a band of beautiful slave women as they try to escape a band of brutal raiders
May 12 2015,positive,straight balls to tha wall bad ass
May 12 2015,positive,mad max fury road is bliss absolute chaotic violent heartstopping bliss so much perfect action joined harmoniously with just enough plot and character backstory to balance it out every now and then throughout the many years in cinema there comes a time when a new bar is set for movies of a particular drama like die hard for example in the case of action movies mad max fury road has set the new bar every action movie should be like this one
May 12 2015,positive,i didnt know what to expect from this movie since ive never really seen the mad max featuring mel gibson from the trailers it looked interesting and wellcrazy i thought itd be one of those action packed movies with no purpose i was wrong this movie had a well thought out plot and by the end i walked out of there thinking it is genius this is one of those movies that got their sh  together despite it being crazy
May 12 2015,positive,its like an extreme music video
May 12 2015,positive,when a movie is two hours and you feel like it was thirty minutes after it ends thats means its doing something perfectly right so what does it do perfectly everything thats what this is possibly the best action movie ever made a

May 12 2015,positive,simply an amazing ride
May 12 2015,positive,good action film no plot
May 12 2015,positive,with highoctane action great cinematography practical effects over cgi effects exceptional thrills and a good amount of emotional weight this is the new standard that all action films from here on out need to use as a reference and will go down as one of the best if not the best action film of the decade
May 12 2015,positive,masterpiece george miller has done it again ive seen it three times now and would go again if i had enough money
May 12 2015,positive,nonstop adrenaline pumping visually stunning action from start to finish
May 12 2015,positive,i have no words it was madness glorious glorious madness    you should see it immediately
May 12 2015,positive,a whirlwind of nonstop excitement in a violent dangerous and twisted world where the characters actually are as ed up as they would be in such a place    does not pull any punches and definitely earns its r rating    my only complaint is regarding the weird timestretching and compression effects that resulted from a strange unexplainable choice the director made to vary the playback rate of the film to different rates from what it was captured at    something you dont see in any modern films as well as a tactic used to make stunts seem like they are done at a faster than actual speed
May 12 2015,positive,absolutely phenomenal in every possible way
May 12 2015,positive,this movie might very well be the first of its kind it is an action movie with a runtime comprised of at least 75 action sequences what makes it utterly unique is that the action sequences never burn you out you never become numb to the spectacle of it all the plot is told through action the character development is told through action the themes are defined by action the story beats happen midaction and even the emotions this movie elicits are felt during the action because of what action movies have become today i dont even feel right calling what fury road does action its more like dynamic storytelling action twopointo you may leave the movie feeling for the first few minutes like fury road was thin on story or character development this is because we are so used to action directors compartmentalizing the action one action sequence can usually be summarized as struggle bad guy escapes or struggle good guy gets hurt then it gets back to the real movie to tell you the story fury road is amazing in how it grabs you by the throat straps you to the front of a marauders nitro truck and shows you an entire story without letting you go and youre right there in the middle of it witnessing every detail in perfection no shot settles for too long no shot cuts too quickly all of this is in addition to the fact that every other aspect of the movie was pulled off flawlessly casting directing acting pacing writing special effects editing and the score oh god the score hopefully the legacy of fury road will be as the movie that changed action as a genre not just the best action movie of all time
May 12 2015,positive,with nonstop action backing up a spartan but intelligent and omnipresent narrative fury road is the best possible way to reintroduce mad max to the world and a modern action classic
May 12 2015,positive,hands down the best mad max movie one of the greatest action movies ever and definitely the best movie ive seen all year
May 12 2015,positive,best action movie ive ever seen periodsee it in theaters b4 its too late all other summer blockbusters may as well close up shopvisually like nothing else out there great performances and told a good story despite being completely filled with nonstop action from start to finish  if you dont like cool like cool stuff then you wont like this
May 12 2015,positive,its like all the previous movies went into a blender and came out even more awesome  the new standard of summer action movie

May 12 2015,positive,epic action film ever   light plot but heavy metal  what a lovely day
May 12 2015,positive,this film is a visual roller coaster ride that you wont soon forget a technical masterpiece with some of the most gorgeous cinematography youll ever see hollywood is known for the blue and orange color pallet and miller didt better that everyone else hopefully this will scare the rest of hollywood off they wont ever do it better not only is it visually stunning but it also has emotion you actually give a crap about the good guys which that by itself is an accomplishment when dealing with the action genre bravo sir
May 12 2015,positive,certainly entertaining and visually true to the original mad max fury road delivers exactly what it sets out to road fury a non stop thrill ride of postapocalyptic vehicular warfare with a bunch of psychos     that being said i dont understand why this movie got such stellar reviews it lacks other than action essentially everything else recruited to make a movie dialogue character development plot coherence  and a beginning middle and end mad max fury roas has none of that its just vehicle on vehicle battle for 90 minutes its cool but thats all it is
May 12 2015,positive,makes the fast and furious series look like childs play  very intense exciting
May 12 2015,positive,amazing  i wanted to turn around and go back into the theatre and watch it again  characters art direction cinematography editing score and that stunt work  holy crap   i adore true filmmaking
May 12 2015,positive,fantastic thrill ride
May 11 2015,positive,if you dont like this movie you are a bad person and probably torture small animals  you more than likely enjoy the works of karl marx while eating babies and wishing obama could win a third term
May 11 2015,positive,an incredible tour de force the most visually exciting movie ive seen since sin city the action is fantastic and there are chances to catch your breath but not many i cant praise it enough unbelievable that a 70 year old man made the most exciting and visceral hollywood movie of the last decade youve got to see this movie i saw it in imaxx and the 3d was very solid
May 11 2015,positive,this movie is insanely incredible the practical effects the stunts charlize theronit is beautifully chaotic you dont need to know the past films of mad max to understand the story its new fresh vibrant and absolutely brilliant
May 11 2015,positive,one of the most beautiful movies i ever seen this year the visuals are mindblowing
May 11 2015,positive,awesome movie not great work superb by george miller
May 11 2015,positive,brutal daring imaginative and involving fury road rocked my expectations crafting a bleak postapocalyptic action blockbuster with surprising narrative heft the acting cinematography and story are all phenomenally and meticulously crafted it truly is refreshing to be reminded that logical intelligent action can still be shot that is positively invigorating miller makes several daring narrative choices that up the ante and stakes in this film true menace exists thanks to a terrifying villain and truly dangerous beefy action sequences also loved the character development strong female characters character arcs and fascinating religious and themes of human nature tom hardy is great charlize theron is even better and george miller is to be commended most of all    addendum this movie is almost utter perfection upon a rewatch i was astonished at the amount of detail and subtlety within the world and the performances note maxs endearing awkwardness when presenting his plan for redemption to furiosa fantastic feels so genuine so real so compelling truly a masterwork if you havent seen it stop what youre doing and see it i have a feeling every other movie i see this summer will simply be a movie i saw after mad max
May 11 2015,positive,automatically gets put into the distinction of one of the best action movies of all time  amazing chasesstunts pure entertainment

May 11 2015,positive,man oh man  what a ride   this was such an exceptional movie   i was thoroughly entertained and on the edge of my seat the entire time it really brought me back to yesteryear  and the good times i had watching the original mad max films ill go see it a few more times im sure its that good
May 11 2015,positive,visceral and bonkers the last action movie well ever need so insanely good in its gonzo frenetic bmovie way
May 11 2015,positive,now this is an action movie take note michael bay zach snyder and all you other hollywood hacks nonstop action filmed with practical effects and insane stunts mixed with a tender thoughtful story is how its done fury road delivers more than i could ever ask and sets the standard for modern action movies
May 11 2015,positive,near perfection in an action film has been achieved in this film better than the road warrior the cinematography in the beginning is unique and stunning and the characterization is perfection this is a best picture candidate here and if the academy does not realize it they are being smug elitists
May 11 2015,positive,hope is a mistake if you dont fix whats broken youll go insane
May 11 2015,positive,an over the top insane gritty near 2 hour ride through apocalyptic hell mad max fury road is easily an early contender for best big release this year well if they gave out oscars for action films i guess its a film that must be seen in imax to get the full experience also its a movie that you will probably want to revisit several times before its theater run is finished
May 11 2015,positive,crazy wicked violent and just pure destruction what else do you want
May 11 2015,positive,one of the most action packed movie ive seen
May 11 2015,positive,mad max is back crazy stunts and thundering sound track another great summer flick i still prefer gibson as max though but hardy was pretty good as the man of few words
May 11 2015,positive,such a speechless movie that will keep you to focus without any talk in the whole story fighting mad max
May 11 2015,positive,it was awesome  in 3d it is more awesome
May 11 2015,positive,mad max fury road is an outrageous over the top beautiful intense relentless and unforgettable action film that is the culmination of 30 years of genius from director george miller this film will stay with you longer than avengers age of ultron if you give it a chance
May 11 2015,positive,one of the best action films ive seen in a long time
May 11 2015,positive,a fugitiverefugee movie kind of long and not for the squeamish it has some mildly gross scenes in it and didnt quite deliver on what i came to see the movie for the main character max didnt do much driving in his own vehicle   some strengths it had going in its favor were that it had good visual effects and decent battle scenes
May 11 2015,positive,mad max fury road is a terrific action filmthe acting was great but what youre really here for is the action and it deliversthe best way to describe this movie is beautiful chaosthe directing was terrific the action was very well directedoverall this is a great action film that i would suggest checking out  grade a
May 11 2015,positive,alluringly macabre and glamorously disturbing mad max fury road masters the balance between story telling character development and over the top action
May 11 2015,positive,should be called furiosa
May 11 2015,positive,visually stunning fastpaced powerful film with the ability to make you actually wish for a dystopian world where classic cars are supedup and jump off sand dunes hurling explosives at each other hardys ability was wasted a bit with his lack of speaking parts but he made up for it with his thrilling action scenes  pros titillating visuals and action scenes a fascinating plot with nonstop activity phenomenal overthetop acting especially from the antagonists explosions galore  cons confusing for those who may not be familiar with the series dialogue wont be winning any awards not a good movie for folks who despise having a good time  i definitely recommend mad max fury road but buckle up itll be a wild ride
May 11 2015,positive,light on story but heavy on symbolism feminism and frenetic action that makes most movies look like kids playing with toys mad max is one reboot that is worth all the guzzle in the world hardys max is appropriately mostly mute and therons furiosa is a whirlwind of desperate but focused fury in their escape from the megalomaniacal immortan joe go for the mad stay for the furiosa oh and the pans labyrinthlike dude carving his megaaxe before three dozen speakers atop a garage wars vehicle on crack blaring heavy metal riffs to valhalla

May 11 2015,positive,trust me the plot isnt earth shattering but the movie is great nonstop action
May 11 2015,positive,mad max fury road       a master class in cinematography some of the most beautifully shot scenes i have ever seen in a movie and i have seen a lot of movies       a master class in action most of the stunts were real really scary stuff the tension was amazing i felt like a passenger in the war rig at any moment it could be the end       simplistic yet effective plot a chieftain had something precious taken from him he wants it back the person who took that which was precious has very legitimate reasons to do so and get out also that which was precious was more important than gasoline and oil the rest of the story is how the tension between the protagonist and antagonist is resolved this allowed the action scenes to breath and be very relevant for the plot of the movie       crisp acting costumes and makeup i felt that we were in that postapocalyptic culture it was a good touch that max was never really a part of that culture it provides some insight to his characters distance in the movie    in all i loved the movie it is very graphic and violent yet it is a story well told
May 11 2015,positive,this is the best action movie of the decade hands down beautifully shot and scored and perfect pace and dialogue along with amazingly vibrant and nail biting action scenes that get better and better
May 11 2015,positive,great tribute to 80s movies great production design an alley of kinetic excitement of half an hour and an unexpected plot twist

May 11 2015,positive,goat of postapocalyptic movies and amazing movie all around
May 11 2015,positive,so good non stop action
May 11 2015,positive,one of the greatest action films ever made and a triumph of visual storytelling powerful lowdialogue performances and gorgeously detailed worldbuilding as well as some of the most spectacular stunts ever filmed miller has the energy of a young visionary out to prove himself but the control of a master craftsman at the top of his game    full review here normannerdblogspotcom201505madmaxfuryroadwearenotthingshtml

May 11 2015,positive,im still trying to process what i just saw
May 11 2015,positive,a movie master piece being shown to you in every scene like a stroke of a brush in an artwork
May 11 2015,positive,loved the action costumecar design and overall vibe that final 13rd was amazing just short of 5 stars as i didnt like the soundtrack the overused benny hillesq spedup frame rate and i could understand about 40 of the dialogue it ended so strongly though hopefully theyll nail it in the sequel
May 11 2015,positive,this film met my wildest dreams of what it could be in terms of cinematography action pace plot characters and effects and surpassed them watch out marvel this is by far the best summer movie
May 11 2015,positive,high flying action that will make your heart race and leave you breathless at times  yes the story is weak but the visuals and comedic relief are refreshing and so well done  great fast paced action movie
May 11 2015,negative,and ladies and gentlemen welcome to the most overrated film of 2015 fury road only impresses with its action sequences which are extravagantly shot directed and executed its usage of real chases and explosions takes the film into a realistic realm the likes of which we rarely see in todays cgiheavy world but beyond that the film fails to live up to the hype it has procured the socalled wonderful acting was either over exaggerated or monotone it was nearly impossible to tell exactly what was going on why insert name here was running from insert name here why certain occurrences were happening so on and so forth fury road is hyped as the most astounding action films of modern times a more appropriate title would be most overrated film of modern times
May 11 2015,positive,an adrenaline shot to the aorta stylish and unique in every frame
May 11 2015,positive,9610  this movie had me extremely excited not only did it looked like an action extravaganza it featured a great cast and looked very appealing thus after watching the first two mad max movies and not being quite what i was expecting i still anticipated very anxiously this movie mad max fury road proved to be an extremely entertaining extremely exciting and just complete action packed movie that never stops and only gets crazier with every chase or scene tom hardy as the titular max was just great and really added another layer to his character as to how mad he is while being likable and he was just great he really was completely different from mel gibsons interpretation and it was like looking at a completely different character which was good also charlize theron as furiosa was also very fierce and a very strong character that never felt like a victim but one that fought her own fights till the end the five wives lead by rosie huntingtonwhiteley and zoã kravitz were very good as well in more limited roles though but still very strong characters that couldve easily been victimized or stereotyped but fought like anyone else just like riley keough abbey lee and courtney eaton the other wives that also had a very strong presence moreover the cinematography looked very beautiful no matter if it was day or night it always looked like this amazing place and when watching at all the action sequences it was just amazing and eye popping to look at with always something going on in one of the most crazy rides theres ever been on the big screen the score was also really good and gave this extra sense of dread and tension to an incredible movie director george miller really outdid himself with this movie not only did he managed to pull this off and even surpass the original but he made what probably is one of the best action movies ever or at least in my opinion it was out of this world and it never stopped even in the most ridiculous sequences it had everything on its side everything an action movie or any blockbuster movie would want the whole pack it surely is one that shouldnt be missed on the big screen and better yet in 3d this one is a ride that youll never forget and will get out of the movie theaters wanting more as if it could be possible   may 15 2015
May 11 2015,positive,adreneline fuelled insanely exciting insight into what female rule would look like in a post tk maxx flamethrowing guitar petrol headed apocalyptic future

May 11 2015,positive,the film is so awesome
May 11 2015,positive,mad max fury road  1010    on a scale of 1 to mint this is off the charts tom hardy replacing mel gibson worked incredibly well adding a fresh take on one of the greatest characters in cinema history charlize theron plays feriosa who takes up more screen time and more lines than hardy  but this is by no means a negative in fact theron shines and proves that she is one of the best actresses around you may go in thinking this will be a fuel  pumped action which it is but it is so much more than that watch this on the biggest screen possible in 3d and make sure it is loud for the cinematography is off the charts action sequences out of this world and the score by far one of the best i have ever heard george miller strikes back after 30 years creating not only the best mad max adventure but also the 2nd best film of 2015 so far
May 11 2015,positive,not much of a story  but great action through out the movie
May 11 2015,positive,fantastic and breathtaking action and a great narrative  this is the best action film of the decade   a
May 11 2015,positive,one of the greatest action movies of all time a milestone in the genre

May 11 2015,positive,how action should be done a
May 11 2015,positive,what a lovely fucking great movie    minimum dialogue furiosa as main protagonist max as comain protagonist    insanely action scenes but nevertheless a character driven movie it has been forever that i didnt have so much fun watching an action movie like this    fury road is certainly one of the best action films that ive ever seen in my life for its history for its characters and the world destroyed crying for hope    5 outta 5
May 11 2015,positive,one of the best actions films that i have ever seenjust incredible i loved 
May 11 2015,positive,if you need to numb your mind without alcoholdrugs or icecream 0 calories  then spending 2 hours watching this movie will be a surefire solution there is absolutely no plot no characters youll really care about in fact there isnt much about this movie youll remember the next day
May 11 2015,positive,sweet baby jesus this movie is just insane more we need more
May 11 2015,positive,insanely mad in every way this astonishing and extremely creative action masterpiece will melt you in your cinema seat
May 11 2015,positive,i live i die i live again witness i am awaited in valhalla
May 11 2015,positive,ive been super excited for this since i saw the trailer i was more excited about this than i was about avengers age of ultron did it live up expectations hell yeah it did this movie is freaking awesome it kicks all the ass is it the most thought provoking film ever no does it have an amazingly original storyline with super complex and deep characters no when you get down to it its a 2 hour chase scene but that doesnt matter with this movie it wanted to be fun and it achieved that what sets this apart from other movies that try to be nothing more than fun is the fact that it doesnt waste time on a story that doesnt matter anyway lets use the transformers franchise as an example overall pretty terrible franchise why well a lot of reasons but the one i care about here is that each movie wastes time on pointless crap that doesnt matter its a transformers movie i want to see transformers fight i dont want to watch humans argue in a transformers movie those movies cant be fun if they keep wasting time on stupid stuff mad max doesnt do that it lays out the basics so it makes some amount of sense then they get straight to the action and it doesnt really stop we get two glorious hours of exceptionally directed action scenes with no crap in between this really is one of the better action movies ive seen in recent years and i really hope they make more go see it
May 11 2015,positive,best movie of 2015 and one of the greatest action films of all time it deserves all the accolades it gets george miller gets cinema
May 11 2015,positive,oh yeah a 5 stars for this epic movie fullaction movie all along and no time to breathe a must to see in theater
May 11 2015,positive,unrestrained and insane from start to finish mad max fury road is an enthralling action film which never stops to take a breath
May 11 2015,positive,mad max fury road has by far the best cinematography of the year and will turn as one of the best of the year george miller brings us back after three decades to his postapocalyptic world of chaos and he couldnt have done it any better the action sequences sequences fly in at nonstop speed its human element is present it has heart and a pulsepounding score by junkie xl who made the film his own by accelerating the action sequences with its score props to miller for bringing up the idea of putting a guitar guy and some drummers to greatfully represent that bottom line george miller has masterfully directed this film and made it its own with beautifully shot scenes and nonstop action throughout which is so rare these days to see such an actionheavy film play out so well
May 11 2015,positive,if you are an antifeminist then by all means avoid this movie  because damn what a lovely day the women have stolen the show with extreme high praise to charlize theron as imperator furiosa two hours of nonstop adrenaline mixed in with a hefty amount of emotion it eats at you wanting even enemyturned allies to stay alive throughout     tom hardy is the perfect replacement as max rockatanksy and it lives up to every amount of hype that you had any worries for the film was beautifully shot the wasteland was like nothing i had ever seen before in a postapocalyptic world and to think that 99 of the time you are watching real stunt work and real practical effects every vehicle is real and crafted to be menacing i havent felt this happy over an action movie in over a decade    fury road has set the bar high for all action movies after it and is going to be one difficult experience to top for the remainder of the year oh and how can we forget the guy with the flamethrower guitar george miller you just gave the middle finger to all of hollywood thereafter this is how a cinema should be done
May 11 2015,positive,the most art and craft ive seen in a big budget action movie ever a total thrill to see on screen
May 11 2015,positive,holy crap this movie is a masterpiece holy crap
May 11 2015,positive,action movie of the year
May 11 2015,positive,best action movie ive seen in a long time
May 11 2015,positive,what a movie what a lovely movie its not quite as i expected it to be the whole movie all 2 hours of it feels like one very long chase scene and while the action sequences are really impressive and the effects and costumes are amazing it gets a bit tiresome nearing the end it needs more story the whole movie has less talking than a 90 minute movie the acting is good nothing exceptional tom hardy can still put on quite a show the characters are interesting enough though some of them are underdeveloped all in all a very adrenaline filled movie with great action and acting though falls a bit flat when it comes to storytelling and characters i would still recommend seeing it
May 11 2015,positive,epic brings in all the benefits of a higher budgetproduction value while still doing justice to the original story and style entertaining throughout
May 11 2015,positive,all i can say is it wasweird
May 11 2015,positive,one of the most perfect amazing and stunning action films to come out in the last decade this was pure gold
May 11 2015,positive,this movie is incredible  for the costumevehicle design and insane stuntwork alone 85 of which was practical effects  not cg this is essential viewing but the story as well is surprisingly coherent and well done and the cinematography is fantastic most of the way through and just plain jaw dropping in a few parts  charlize theron and tom hardy are both great for their roles and all of the supporting cast is just as good  if you like action movies this is one of the best ones in recent memory bar none  highly highly recommended
May 11 2015,positive,mad max is the most intense 2 hours ive ever spent in a theater
May 11 2015,positive,fury road uses an extended car chase as a vehicle to shed light on multiple stories in the world of mad max some of the stories are told in their entirety others show you just enough to crave more
May 11 2015,positive,non stop action but weak on plot the first mad max was by far the best 3d is spectacularly in your face you will duck
May 11 2015,positive,a tale full of sound and fury with plenty of significance
May 11 2015,positive,what a highoctane edgeofyourseat thrill ride fury road left me feeling uncomfortable from the get go so bizarre and messed up but not without themes of redemption and hope i found myself engrossed into millers whacky world oddly though for a movie titled mad max i felt very underwhelmed by tom hardy and his title character
May 11 2015,positive,i think i pulled a muscle
May 11 2015,positive,was going to pass on this movie the original were okay but saw the tomatometer at 100 so figure need to see it   i agree it was an excellent movie the the sets costumes special effects acting script everything   liked the modern take on the story  the only negative was the ending there a couple pausesblank screens that seem like they were sure what to do and use a pause to change up    that seems to be a problem with a lot of movies they dont seem to have the ending completely worked out and start to fall apart
May 11 2015,positive,a perfect action spectacle worth the 30 years it took to create absolute perfection 1010
May 11 2015,positive,mad max fury road gave me a weird feeling like i was watching some kind of theatrical act the hardcore spectacle was gracious smooth and had in my honest opinion some amazing choreographies in it
May 11 2015,positive,great nonstop action in my opinion better than all the movies with mel
May 11 2015,positive,30 years  was it worth the wait it was worth the wait 180 million dollars worth of stunt work action pyrotechnics and absolutely amazing action did i say action a chase which lasts mainly the entire 2 hours of the movies run time  and its never boring we needed a 70 year old filmmaker to give hollywood and good kick in the ass that says  lay down the cgi and get back to lean mean practical movies  i see at press time 4 imbeciles reviewed this movie rotten out of over 200 critics  wow they must be on life support  anyone with a pulse who isnt jazzed by the amazing pacing jawdropping stuntwork and rapid fire action needs to get some cpr pronto  the best movie of the summer  hell the year  maybe even this whole decade
May 11 2015,positive,its max hes not mel gibson but tom hardy is mind blowing subtle and effective   this time hes accompanied by furiosa who shines brighter and so do a dozen more characters   this marvelous example of modern day analog film making relies on the raw visuals the intensity and the pace its the action movie that you want to see again and again 3d preferred
May 11 2015,positive,awesome action good morals
May 11 2015,positive,furious furiosa  witness this film
May 11 2015,positive,quite possibly the best action movie ever
May 11 2015,positive,george miller has delivered an aussie action tour de force that is also a surprisingly superb sequel that almost out does the famous second installment road warrior do your self a favor go see the 4th mad max a movie 30 years in the making
May 11 2015,positive,lush kinetic explosive action sequences intermixed with some gorgeous slower scenes highly visual and lots of fun
May 11 2015,positive,visually stunning unique action packed and just fun
May 11 2015,positive,couldve had more story but i loved the vibe of the characters and the world it reminded me of dredd and drive
May 11 2015,positive,if you currently have nothing to do make haste and watch mad max fury road
May 11 2015,positive,nonstop incredible action crazy visual amazing set design and costumes hardy and charlize are the ultimate badas explosions 3d is a must xd or imax 3d if you can
May 11 2015,positive,words cant describe how i feel about mad max fury road but ill sum it up like this this is the greatest action film i have ever seen hands down
May 11 2015,positive,a masterpiece on its own
May 11 2015,positive,enough said this movie is mind bottling
May 11 2015,positive,it was a good movie where it was a combination of thunderdome meets road warrior    the car scenes are intense and well choreographed    tom hardy does a good job as mad max but charlize theron does a great job as imperator furiosa
May 11 2015,positive,rating 1010    few films that ive seen have been so willing to embrace their own brand of madness so faithfully and fearlessly as mad max fury road  here is a film that wildly gives the middle finger to exposition and handholding and instead just puts you into its universe and takes you for a ride  and wow what a ride    the film starts with the titular max being taken prisoner just before imperator furiosa charlize theron brilliant stages an escape after secretly kidnapping the wives of immortan joe a tyrant whose warriors believe he will lead them into valhalla one day and would die to serve him  sound ridiculous  of course it is  gloriously and unabashedly ridiculous  and from this point about 8 minutes into the film the movie shoots off like a cannon and we get to follow it as it crashes through glass house after glass house with only minimal breaks between houses  like i said theres basically zero exposition  the story is simple  the universe grand  this is a borderlands meets the odyssey rock opera and its a nonstop thrill ride  thats not to say it has no depth because it does  but it isnt parading its depth like some other films do      sorry avengers  you had a short run as the years best action film but mad max has taken the crown
May 11 2015,positive,the best movie so far this summer
May 11 2015,negative,i was excited to see this movie but it didnt live up to expectations for me personally
May 11 2015,positive,thats  a fucking master piece its a different film in every way new proposals great special effects spectacular performances written history is original and the antropologic component is very good i would have liked more if  was called imperator furiousa the movie
May 11 2015,positive,you get more than what you expect hands down my favourite action movie ever what a blast
May 11 2015,positive,it took thirty years for george miller to add another installment to his mad max series and it was worth the wait
May 11 2015,positive,obviously mad max fury road was crafted to satisfy the cravings of actionhungry folks and it did more than well its a twohour sweet explosive and definitely insane cinematic fireball
May 11 2015,positive,very weird the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous there were moments of brilliance the movie flowed almost shakespearean i felt like i was watching a brilliant play the problem is that it was overshadowed by too much pointless action some action scenes are understandable and had their place but you could actually cut about 45 minutes of bloated action from this movie and have a better movie overall by the end of the movie i was relieved because i was tired of explosions from a car being hit by a pole or a grandma the movie felt like it was 4 hours long its a shame because the 3 and a half star movie i was left with couldve easily been 5 stars if they hadnt had so much action
May 11 2015,positive,so here is the first worthwhile spectacle of 2015 max weve been expecting you quite madly so
May 11 2015,positive,believe the hype this may be the best action movie ever made
May 11 2015,positive,tom hardy is fabulous
May 11 2015,positive,wow what a movie nonstop action from start to finish amazing graphics and 3d effects worth paying for a 2nd watch
May 11 2015,positive,george miller has topped himself  i liked the original mad maxit was okay but the road warrior was really the film to beatand miller might have  this movie is low on plot but high on actionit is one long chase scene but it is one hell of an exciting chase  great stunts great effects great everything  it was refreshing as hell to see an action movie that didnt rely heavily on cgi and lacked superheroes this movie is a perfect extension of the mad max movies of yesteryear and might actually be the best mad max movie that has been made  everything is great in this go see it youll love it
May 11 2015,positive,a perfect action ride george miller has done what every other director revisiting an old franchise couldnt
May 11 2015,positive,exhausting utterly brilliant nonstop action my film of 2015 so far
May 11 2015,positive,with its high octane and energetic action and engaging performance by tom hardy as max mad max fury road breathes new life into the mad max franchise even without the presence of mel gibson its summer blockbuster entertainment at its finest and it delivers the goods
May 11 2015,positive,the story isnt there but it doesnt need to be and the movie doesnt pretend that it does
May 11 2015,positive,director george miller gives us unrelenting action with reason and with stakes the result is one hell of a ride
May 11 2015,positive,this might be my favorite movie of 2015 so far
May 11 2015,positive,a superb reinvention of the classic introduced in 1979 in 2015 we have a version with stunning and exciting special effetcs a brilliant soundtrack and the elements that made this franchise so beloved hardy replaces extremely well mel gibson as a man hunted by his past whos only trying to survive in an undecent and crazy world but being honest who steals it is charlize theron as furiosa shes so good that her characters name should be on the title hoult is also amazing as a dying boy whos blind to immortan joes legacy and eventually becomes a key role in the film and yes theres still plently space to humor george miller made a terrific film who manages to be as good as or perhaps even better than the movies released three decades ago
May 11 2015,positive,just brilliant the details are visual candy the way it was filmed was so clever it was just an average day in mad max world and we were part of it simple exceptional would watch again just for the details that were put in every and each scene
May 11 2015,positive,mad max fury road is an amazing one of a kind film it boast crazy action and extreme stunts
May 11 2015,positive,exciting decadent over the top mayhem and destruction
May 11 2015,positive,hugely enjoyable film in my opinion that is fast paced looks incredible and boasts a flame throwing double necked guitar admittedly it doesnt have a complex plot it wont change the way you live your life or make you question yourself in a spiritual way but this is very much in keeping the previous mad max films     just like in mad max 2 and 3 the world is in a postapocalyptic state of anarchy human beings struggle for basic things like food water and clothes it seems but do possess some damn funky automobiles and other associated gizmos that would make the average petrolhead very excited indeed very early on max and his iconic car with the spinney turbo thing coming out of the bonnet gets captured by a group of chelsea football hooligans nothing very mad about max here as puts up about as much of a fight as you would expect if michael jackson wrestled mr t lame to summarise some people decide to pop out for some groceries in a huge truck and since the desert lacks road signs they subsequently get lost a scouting party is sent to find then and direct them to the nearest kwikimart but they find that a group of young under nourished girls have stowed away on the truck their daduncleboyfriend he is all of these at once is very upset about this puts on his darth vader costume and goes to find them himself then a big chase happens followed by a very brief lull then another big chase with some explosions and just in case you felt that there wasnt enough chases there are some more and thats about it    tom hardy basically just grunts a lot but fortunately not in an incoherent bane type way but ill allow this as max is supposed to be mean and moody and this he does successfully but lets face it this is really charlize therons film she does her best pseudo robocopannie lennox impression and drives a truck everyone elses role is just to look good and this is achieved in the main     you would think that a 2 hour chase would wear thin very quickly terminator 3 anyone but fury road manages to avoid this maybe its because its so well choreographed and just looks so damn great in a neil armstrong magnificent desolation kind of way   i would also pay big money for some the more popular music acts around these days to employ the use of the flame throwing guitar live on set this would obviously mean the donning of a flameproof suit anywhere near the vicinity but the upside is that we wouldnt be able to hear the beibers and one directions of this world win
May 11 2015,positive,let me put this in simpler terms this is the best action movie ever made ive never seen a movie so bold this one ranks among my top 10 all time
May 11 2015,positive,oh what a movie what a lovely movie
May 11 2015,positive,i was lucky enough to catch a prescreening in denver since this is an extraearly review i will go out of my way to avoid spoiling anything  fury road doesnt resemble anything else i have ever seen even including the other mad max films the budget is everywhere on the screen from the vehicles i hesitate to call any of them cars to the environment to the quality of the actors in every way it has the feel and atmosphere of a world gone completely insane with everyone having long since accepted that fact and moved on tom hardy makes the most of a character who is written with all the personality of a block of granite even in his most human moments max is still closer to a force of nature than a man charlize therons furiosa is the brains heart and soul of the film and she does a great job with the role for essentially eye candy a role they play admirably a real attempt is made to give the other women prominent in the trailers individual personalities but this primarily comes off as independent quirks there are simply too many of them for fully fleshedout characterization still its a valiant effort in a film that really didnt need to make it to pull the target audience  there is a strong and undeniable feminist streak running through the film that gets stronger as it goes along one that has aspects of both nurturing instinct and raw strength it never feels patronizing anything that the protagonists achieve has to be torn tooth and nail from the hellish wasteland the immortal joe and a rogues gallery of other assorted baddies are never given the same humanizing respect they are deformed beasts possessed of an animal cunning and not the smallest drop of decency liquids of all kinds play a dominant role in the film to the point where anything liquid becomes fraught with subtext its a simple unique storytelling technique that works like gangbusters playing against the stark parched background of the mad world  overall i find it difficult to be overly critical of anything in fury road it delivers on every promise the trailers made and a whole lot more besides with visceral violence genuinely incredible action solid writing and dozens of moments that made me think yes someone really thought that out properly i would hesitate to call it a smart film that wasnt part of the brief but it certainly delivers on everything a sane person could ask for and it is definitely firing on all cylinders
May 10 2015,positive,an absolutely amazing film seriously this movie will melt your face off some may complain that its too weird or that its just one long road trip movie but it never really claimed to be anything else  1010

May 10 2015,positive,an unrelenting strapyourselfin action masterpiece that ignites the passion of an earlier era of making such insane and bonkers spectacle youll leave the theatre championing this film wondering how the hell did they pull this off meanwhile  as you gaze into your rearview mirror memories of subpar greenscreen envisioned setpieces begin to vanishessentially smashed to bits and left for dead at the side of the road wow what a ride
May 10 2015,positive,first movie in 2015 that i cant wait to see again  the abundance of thrills is hardly surprising given the previous movies in this series but george millers eye makes every frame pitch perfect  the big bonus is therons oscarworthy performance  this film is simply stunning

May 10 2015,positive,i was very disappointed in the movie as a whole very slow at times didnt really like the guitar player in the front of the truck thought it was stupid it did have some special effects at points but other than that to predictable

May 10 2015,positive,phenomenal in every way george miller has outdone himself in his latest addition to the mad max franchise faster paced than the originals with even sleeker and stylish direction and masterful color palates this film basically a 2 hour nonstop chase scene is worth its admission price the only movie so far this summer i want to watch twice one can only hope theaters will pull age of ultron from the imax theaters so that the spectacle of mad max fury road can be witnessed on the grandest scale
May 10 2015,positive,120 minute movie 100 minutes of insane action set across a surreal postapocalyptic backdrop  its wild its crazy and its effing awesome  oh and it has a mobile metal band a mobile metal band go see the best action movie to come out in quite some time

May 10 2015,positive,george millers first mad max movie in more than thirty years is quite a ride  it is definitely one of the most imaginative and creative movies ive seen in a long time  the stunts are amazing and the overall production design is quite a blast  a must see 
May 10 2015,positive,it doesnt let you breathe make up and costume were amazeballs
May 10 2015,positive,a masterpiece of action movie that make you hold your breath from the first till the end this is what a car chase movie should be with a spectacular real stunts and less cgi that make fast 7 looks like an orgy action movie only for 10 years old teenager
May 10 2015,positive,this is an incredible masterpiece        that was my first opinion after watchin  this film over 20 times and i cant get over it wow everything is just perfectly perfect
May 10 2015,positive,fury road is george millers beautiful blistering cacophony of madness so unique and insane yet at the same time pleasingly oldschool and practical that it becomes an instant action classic with a bit more depth i wouldnt have hesitated in calling it one of the greatest action films ever made period
May 10 2015,positive,the first minute of the movie was kind of slow then it was all action for the other 2 hours
May 10 2015,positive,worth seeing enjoyed it
May 10 2015,positive,wow explosive fantastic a great movie to see and feel good vibes
May 10 2015,positive,everything i had hoped for
May 10 2015,positive,george miller has said that he seeks and pursues pure cinematic language and in fury road he delivers the pure cinematic language of the chase bold and unwavering fury road will have you on the edge of your seat the entire time    find more here 
May 10 2015,positive,a beautiful nightmare thats my first thought about mad max fury road full tilt action this is all momentum tom hardy is max in this reboot of the classic post apocalyptic series but i would argue that charlize theron as furiosa is the star mmfr is relentless most of the movie is a chase across the desert and all the mayhem that ensues through out said chase while its happening heres what you need to know water and oil are the most valuable commodities in the world now drive this may be the most actiony action movie ever it goes long and yes you will be exhausted by the end but i assure you it is beautiful to watch like a dark opera come to life thrilling frightening mesmerizing and its rated r the bar has been raised
May 10 2015,positive,absolutely mad and visually stunning with great camera work during actions showing those shaky camera movies how its done
May 10 2015,positive,omg listen i rarely give five stars to any movie but maaannnnnn this right here gave me absolute life it also helps that i have a 4k tv and blu ray lol pleaserentthismovie â 34ï
May 10 2015,positive,the best of the mad max series yet great stuff
May 10 2015,positive,reminded me why i love movies

May 9 2015,positive,this is why we go to the moviesexcellent filmaction from beginning to endworth watching
May 9 2015,positive,85 fan rating i loved this movie 
May 9 2015,positive,bout goddamn time but more than worth the wait a bloody action masterpiece that is essential for anyone who loves seeing carnage without chaotic cuts or shots well i mean the kind where you cant tell whats going on are the bad kind this is orchestrated mayhem on an epic scale hardy is hardy theron should get another oscar t and the dude playing the flame thrower guitar is the baddest motherfucker ive seen in a mobile in years
May 9 2015,positive,fight scenes were cool but it was really slow in between definitely worth a one time viewing
May 9 2015,positive,nonstop action and thrills bring lots of popcorn
May 9 2015,positive,whoa completely speechless over what i just witnessed this is the best movie of the year so far it does the original source material proud and george miller proves once again that his postapocalyptic vision bursts off the big screen in grandiose fashion as expected loved all 3 lead actors here charlize killed it as usual as you can pretty much imagine every scene is just plain ridiculously violent and balls out entertaining from start to finish especially the instant classic sandstorm scene very much looking forward to more sometime down this fury road my highest recommendation
May 9 2015,positive,perfection in every way  for an action movie my favorite action movie of 2015
May 9 2015,positive,just saw a sneak peek of this  this is the best action movie in the last 10 years eclipsed the previous movies easily  so well done on every front stop what youre doing and see this movie as soon as you can
May 9 2015,positive,went and saw it again and had to knock off half a star  its still crazy and i like it  but that ending just pisses me off    old review  its insanely crazy in a good violent kind of way  the ending is iffy but im not complaining  great fun but now i have to go see it again for the 3d version
May 9 2015,positive,when the rigs are on the road this trip of a film is a masterpiece its when the parking break is on that the film runs a tad dry only a tad however do not be fooled by that to think this is not an incredible film tom hardy adds to what will one day be one incredible list of filmography that will likely land him a reputation much like the legends we know today clint eastwood for example theron is great and really solidifies the film but the contributor whom truly makes this film as mad as it is is the beautifully twisted imagination of george miller its a worthy sequel and an even more mad max 90
May 9 2015,positive,a 2 hour non stop rollercoaster ride action packed visually stimulating and about the most intense movie i have ever seen charlize theron steals the show with the most bad ass female lead since sigourney weaver in aliens i was worn out after watching it
May 9 2015,positive,definitely different
May 9 2015,positive,even though never seen the originals thought this film was quite good from start to finish action
May 9 2015,positive,an action adrenalizing film that is packed with a suprising spin as the females are the ones who are centered on and get the most attention in the film and are the action stars
May 9 2015,positive,itâtms been a longâ time since i walked out of a movie just completely stunned  wondering 1 how in the hell did this thing actually get made on a technical and metaphysical level 2 how willâ  future action movies proceed since the landscape has now so radically irrevocably changed   in those respects itâtms very reminiscent of my first ever viewing of the matrix jurassic park or star wars and youâtmd think this is just a result of the eyepopping practicaleffectsladen production but itâtms everything that surrounds it as well this is a dangerous off kilter movie that i canâtmt believe the 70yearold film maker convinced studios a general audience would want to see my favorite testament to this is a teen girl who was in the audience â i sat with after a ballstothewall opening 10 minutes i heard her say âthis isâweirdâtm by the end of the movie she was clapping for a movie that features the ostensible protagonist washing blood off of his face in a basin of motherâtms milk this is an incredible feat i canâtmt say enough good things about this movie itâtms different and itâtms incredible
May 9 2015,positive,great movie undertones of real world events at the moment the script wasnt to involved but it was a extremely well made film and had no boring parts highly recommend
May 9 2015,negative,the one star is for the visuals which wear nice eye candy but the dialog and story was so bad i literally had to force myself to watch the movie all the way but i had to do that in several sessions if you turn the sound off maybe it would be a better movie
May 9 2015,positive,now i walked into this film having only seen the teaser trailer i wanted the surprise and boy did i get one mad max is plain awesome now i havent seen any of the older ones but this one makes me definitely check them out as well this movie isnt for everyone it does have a specific style its trying to present and a lot of people might not get that now this movie also looks gorgeous and how can a movie in a desert look pretty you may wonder well the wonderful works of gerorge miller is there to answer that yesthis guy made desert look pretty now a common problem i picked up by other people was that in this movie mad max was the second main character which i think is true but people didnt like that to them i say they already have three films for him so why not take a break and step into the shoes of another character i liked how the roles were divided i liked mad max as a helping hand this is probably one of my favorite movies and also an action one overall from tom hardy to its wonderful action this is a must see
May 9 2015,positive,sometimes so much action can get pretty boring however this movie does not fail to disappoint amazing movie recommend it to anyone make sure you are ready to get amazed because it wont let you down worth all the money
May 9 2015,positive,incredible proper thrill ride
May 9 2015,positive,i really had no desire to see this movie at first because i actually never saw a mad max film but when i saw the trailers i was blown away and i immediately became intrigued looking at the visuals and the action this looks like everything i want to see in an action movie after watching this film i felt ashamed that i never saw a mad max film because fury road is awesome it is such an adrenalinefilled rush that i feel like taking a nap after watching it the entire movie is like one big chase at first i didnt think that much about it i saw it as just a fun heartpumping thrill ride i didnt think it had much story and not enough exposition for me to understand the characters i thought because maybe it was part of a franchise and i didnt see the other films but after multiple viewings i saw that it was telling their story the whole time it was all told through a visual medium its a film that doesnt contain much dialogue so you need to follow the story through its visuals because of this you can immediately understand the characters and the world they live in the film also has a surprising amount of feeling and emotion this helps us feel for the characters and adds a sense of humanity to the film i say that the only people who wouldnt like the film are those who cant handle this kind of action or for those who have never seen a mad max film but even some people who have never seen a mad max movie like me can still find a lot of enjoyment in it i know i did mad max fury road was some of the most fun ive had all year and im sure it will please all fans of the franchise    grade a
May 9 2015,positive,couldnt take my eyes off of it hands down the best action ive ever seen
May 9 2015,positive,i didnt realize it was possible to develop characters and really paint the world gone insane while on a constant road chase without shame mad max brings to life the madness of a dystopian society that has no value for life yet despite the brutality the movie makes me want to be a part of it that is a successful movie truly a spectacle of noise pop culture gone wild and a tease for desperate emotions
May 9 2015,neutral,entertaining yes but horrible story line and writing
May 9 2015,positive,everyone talks about how this is a feminist action film  and it is  but you also have to understand the critique of the aggressive devolved male culture that thinks it can beat rape and bro its way to superiority max is completely lost at the beginning of the film having given in to that part of his identity and it isnt until he meets furiosa that he is able to redeem work his way back out of that masculinist machismo primordial part of the brain the metaphor is there from the very beginning as max snaps into the lizard he is the lizard and has to relearn how to be human     and to get back to the feminist action movie notion it goes without saying that furiosa is simply amazing
May 9 2015,positive,if you are into cars action and madness this is the perfect movie for you  its a wild ride that you will most certainly have fun with enjoy and go mad d
May 9 2015,positive,this is an incredible journey the visual is great the cast is amazing the story is good and they all work together in unison with a massive production to create such masterpiece nothing was expected every turn was a surprise and the ending is awesome   george miller as a director did a great job with the action sequence the chase with its dynamic jumps and explosion that nothing was out of its place and after this i will trust him to bring a decent man of steel p   tom hardy is always awesome though he didnt talk much  cant wait to see him in splinter cell and in 100 bullets    charlize theron the real star of this movie just incredible    ill give it a 910
May 9 2015,positive,is the good film he did not exceed the previous but very enjoyable
May 9 2015,positive,definitely worth the watch
