Apr 13 2024,negative,this movie unfortunately is one of the dumbest and most boring movies i have ever seen its not often i feel like walking out of a cinema i love godzilla movies after seeing the cinematic masterpiece of godzilla minus one i was looking forward to seeing this movie but its just so dumb the acting was really bad the script was really bad and the pacing of this movie is bad godzilla doesnt even do anything this is more of a kong movie featuring godzilla the human characters were extremely cringy stereotypical and very forgettable in godzilla minus one you care about the human characters and you care about the cities being destroyed toho put a lot of effort into their worlds in this its the complete opposite after seeing this movie tonight i couldnt even tell you the name of one of the human characters the slapstick comedy is just embarrassing and the acting is below par now the difficult part as a moviegoer is i want good entertainment good acting good script good movies and im all for people with disabilities being in movies but when you use sign language in a movie so much its awkward when its dead silent i understand its for the plot of the movie even though its a really bad plot the cgi is meh the pacing of godzilla in toho movies is great godzilla is slow in these legendary movies a 160000ton monster jumps off mountains and is way too fast and it just feels very off in the future legendary pictures and warner bros instead of making a poorly made poorly acted poorly scripted forgettable cash grab please leave godzilla movies to those who actually care about what they make and actually know what they are doing and let toho pictures make godzilla movies
Apr 13 2024,positive,fun and entertaining 
Apr 13 2024,positive,before i start i love the monsterverse i love godzilla thats why there are bonus points despite everything for me this film is the worst of the series there is no seriousness anymore even in gvk i had the feeling that it wasnt monsters but action figures fighting against each other i dont like the new direction since gvk i turn off my head and try to enjoy it and i can do that to some extent but i liked the first films up to godzilla kotm better they were threatening the monsters were scary in peoples eyes now they do wrestling tricks  despite everything im looking forward to the next adventures but i wish there was something darker again
Apr 13 2024,positive,that movie was great  aww man we need more 
Apr 13 2024,positive,awesome watch was pretty goofy at times but very entertaining action and fight scenes were sweet
Apr 13 2024,positive,it was a really enthralling and very breathtaking liveactioncgi hybrid monster movie sequel it had really impressive special effects really amazing cast really wonderful characters really awesome action really thrilling adventure really amusing humor really extraordinary music really tremendous costumes really captivating cinematography and a very interesting plot in my opinion i think its going to be my favorite godzilla and king kong movie of the year ive ever seen in theaters in my whole life i extremely recommend this movie to everybody who are the fans of godzilla and king kong
Apr 13 2024,positive,watched this in theaters had no idea there was a monster universe like mcu but for these 2 legendary giants to me it was very well done legendary usually doesnt miss and this film wasnt an exception    my only 2 gripes with it are 1 the movie is very packed with information i wish they had made another one in 2 years because its obvious they could have 2 the marketing doesnt lead you to believe its another episode in some bigger universe if i had known this i totally wouldve been more bought in    dont get me wrong its very well done i just felt like i needed more details but its a good watch
Apr 13 2024,positive,greatest film of all time putting the kaiju canter stage like a giant monster film should king kong is the lead kaiju but adam wingard said if film does well we will get godzilla in lead role next film very excited to see godzilla in lead so please support gxk humans in this film are the greatest and film paces well with lots of action and excellent special effects burny is funny and relatable and jia helps convince godzilla to chill out only thing off was our hero godzilla attacked god tiamat for no reason just to steal her power like a villain if he wanted the power of the ultimate dragon god all he had to do was be cool and ask a godzilla vs tiamat film would not result in a winner not more disrespectful than the original legend i guess but disappointing that this film has not evolved past the pro human themed dd formula where the dragon must be slain in the name of greed and envy when the dragons are truly invincible and the true soul of godzilla
Apr 13 2024,positive,great movie from start to finish
Apr 13 2024,negative,terrible and disjointed story 1 star for a couple of good monster fights

Apr 13 2024,positive,awesome movie cant wait to watch it again

Apr 13 2024,positive,godzilla and kong are the best monsters ever plus mothra join in the fight their scenes are amazing and epic showdown between two kings and two evil monsters    ill give 100000000000 out of 1000
Apr 13 2024,positive,i knew i was going to love godzilla x kong the new empire since the first trailer was released there is a lot of fun goofy kaiju action to experience and king and suko are the hearts of the film my main gripe is the human subplot but its only a minor complaint
Apr 13 2024,positive,its literally the best movie i have ever watched in my life olly 12
Apr 13 2024,positive,i cant believe i was hit by clickbait movie titles should have replaced it with kong and new friends but i dont mind the storyline here i enjoy the cgi and audio of the film and in my opinion its not bad for a film made with an expensive budget just enjoy it
Apr 13 2024,negative,to chessy to much sci fi  looks like the monsterverse of batman  robin
Apr 13 2024,positive,humans were a tad bit better still needed to see more godzilla though
Apr 13 2024,positive,only thing it was missing was more monster fights
Apr 13 2024,positive,perfect everything was amazing
Apr 13 2024,positive,even better than godzilla vs kong in my opinion this movie was amazing and entertaining and more creatures that they show just really makes this movie even better i definitely recommend watching this i loved it and enjoyed every moment of watching
Apr 13 2024,positive,this would actually be a really good silent film about kong going on his own little planet of the apesinspired journey were it not for the stinky humans getting in the way i dont really hate them and they do have plot relevance but lets face it i dont think the audience is coming to a film like this for that young deaf girl angsting over not belonging and rebecca halls dealing with parenthood and for a complaint unrelated to the humans for a movie called godzilla x kong the balance is far too skewed towards the latter whilst the former is out of focus in fact the way the movie ends suggests that this was intentional as while the giant gorilla goes has his own character arc this films conflict is treated by the reptilian kaiju as just another day in the proverbial office probably for the best given the critical acclaim of that minus one film since while i havent seen it im pretty sure comparisons would be unfair given the contrasting tones and anyway godzillas minimal presence is still handled much better than the glorified window dressing that was the dinosaurs in jurassic world 3 but otherwise while unsurprisingly not as insanely fun as gvk i had a good time with the new empire the visual effects and animation are topnotch the action sequences are stellar and as ive pointed out earlier kongs arc is very compelling bereft of dialogue it may be but you can still tell exactly whats going on from their expressions and body language one of the best parts of the film was him being a father figure of sorts to the little baby orange kong because after the mandalorian everything is inspired by lone wolf and cub i guess all that was left was to have kong played by pedro pascal in a really expensive halloween costume and things wouldve been perfect also come on guys how can you not consider this film pure cinema when one scene has kong decking a complaining ape to shut him up and its accompanied by a stock sound effect and he didnt have to drop a joss whedontype quip as if he was embarrassed that they did that smack sound dont let the critics get to you adam wingard as the monsterverses first returning director gxk tne you did a bangup job with what you had to work with and hey if this film was a glorified sales pitch for you to be given the opportunity one day to direct a film thats animated andor silent your handling of king kongs new origin story certainly makes that idea enticing to me d
Apr 13 2024,positive,love godzilla and king kong reminds me of my childhood horror films when monsters were not of the human kind
Apr 13 2024,positive,i loved this movie its a love letter to the showa era with its cartoony feel and i like it as long as its not taking itself way too seriously and it doesnt i enjoyed the action scenes with the monsters and the characters were the best in the monsterverse movies as of writing this review i would recommend it to people who would want to watch a movie with monsters as the main characters that said this movie and the movie before it godzilla vs kong are mainly focused on kong rather than godzilla and as a godzilla fan i wouldve liked it if his fight scenes lasted a little longer    the things i liked about this movie out weighs the things i didnt like but i would like to say it    i dont like the fact that scylla and tiamat were killed very quickly but at the very least have tiamat live godzilla is very similar to finalgoji where he just goes on a tour of killing other monsters the villain skar king is threatening but i didnt get the same king of world ending from him like ghidorah did in kotm i also wouldve liked an explanation on how skar king was able to capture and control shimo using a crystal that looks like one of the spikes on her back    all in all i think that is a good cheesy but fun movie
Apr 13 2024,negative,weak plot lack of imagination waste of time
Apr 13 2024,positive,it was an ok monster movie the fight scenes were mostly not great and quite short some plot points could have been rewritten to make more sense i dont expect a lot from a monster movie but they could have done better it was pretty enjoyable overall
Apr 13 2024,positive,liked the introduction of two new  characters kong is always going to be a star and has a funny side to him although he is bad ass
Apr 13 2024,positive,great finale to an epic buildup  i found this movie even more satisfying than gvk
Apr 13 2024,positive,great special effects story line and bit comedic
Apr 13 2024,negative,so bad it was hilarious
Apr 13 2024,positive,one of the best movies i have ever seen everything is just perfect
Apr 13 2024,positive,2nd time watching it great movie  watched it first time in regular seats  this time was dbox seats really great the feel of the movie was awesome
Apr 13 2024,positive,critics can suck it this movie wasnt for them it was for the fans and it 100 delivered
Apr 13 2024,positive,amazing the moral message exuded by the rotten little gorilla was that if a group is led by a horrific mean uncaring narcissistic brutal sadistic idiot then we can expect the group to also be horrific mean uncaring narcissistic brutal sadistic idiot scar king godzilla jumped kong before he figured out they were on the same side gotta love them both always will love them both
Apr 13 2024,negative,i will never use fandango again we live in a homeless shelter and we used our gift card that we got for christmas to buy tickets for my 7yearold son we dont have a were not able to make it to the theater he was disappointed and we thought we could exchange the tickets for tomorrow we had a friend that could come pick us up but youre lovely website  told us sorry we dont give return for exchanges once the movie had started we ended up having to walk home because we had tried to walk to the theater  we have met a lot of people that look down on us for living in the salvation army   and theres a lot of people that have tried to help us you are obviously not one of those good groups i will make sure that i tell every person i can about fandango
Apr 13 2024,positive,anything with kong and godzilla is great
Apr 13 2024,positive,was a cool movie i liked that kong and godzilla teamed up
Apr 13 2024,positive,such an amazing movie
Apr 12 2024,positive,just a great movie made me feel like a kid watching it the whole time remember its just a fun godzilla movie
Apr 12 2024,negative,this has an absolutely moronic story and terrible cgi this movie is why i dont listen to audiences the majority of people in the world have bad taste its why there are so few trendsetters and so many trend followers
Apr 12 2024,positive,it was great i watched it 2 times in the cinema cause it never gets old i would watch it a 3rd time for sure lots of titan screen time
Apr 12 2024,positive,great fun and action packed film if you want dynamic kaiju fights this is the film for you while some might not like its simple plot or human characters it works here for what is intended to be focused with the continuity from the two previous films in the monsterverse is present in godzilla x kong and im here for it learning to keep the human b plot in the background was a big win here and a heavy focus on kong as a deeper character made this an engaging and satisfying experience if youve been following the films universe you will be rewarded
Apr 12 2024,positive,who cares about the critics the movie is fantastic they dont know how to have fun with the movie and story of the movie was awesome and godzilla new design is amazing but i rather use yellow for the color but character are great the story is awesome   this movie is a 1010
Apr 12 2024,positive,i liked that you saw godzilla and kong pretty much in most of the movie  you didnt have to wait until the end to see action
Apr 12 2024,positive,great film plenty of epic fighting good plot good twists and the best cgi i have ever seen human characters could be better and i would like to see more of monarch but apart from that this film is excellent
Apr 12 2024,positive,most fun monster movies require you to sit through wasted minutes of silly dialogue that does nothing but fill the time between the action and this movie is not the exception but the monster action is well worth seeing on the big screen with a good sound system its visceral
Apr 12 2024,positive,this is no minus one but this is probably one of the better monsterverse movies i agree with a lot of other reviews this could have just been a standalone kong movie but overall it has good action decent pacing and just a good movie if you are already invested into the monsterverse
Apr 12 2024,positive,new monsters were great fight scenes were very well done
Apr 12 2024,positive,old school fan of the original godzilla movies and i thought it was worth my time and money the story plot was predictable but the actors were great great cgi and battle scenes featuring king kong godzilla and mothra fighting together
Apr 12 2024,positive,wow  this movie was incredible  it was fun awesome and exiting as hell there was humor action monster fights and i always maintained a big fat grin through this whole film  it was 2hrs of pure monster mayhem there was barely any humans and it was just so dumb yet so fun it was cartoonish and epic if youre a monster fan i highly suggest this movie  1010
Apr 12 2024,positive,everything you would want in a kaiju movie wingard should focus more on depth on storys but most want just big monsters and less story anyways
Apr 12 2024,positive,the only thing that indian movies is compiling with hollywood is the mass factor especially in southindian movies the slowmo and over the top action in indian movies is unveiling  till gxk arrived the movie is a proper celebration of two gigantic titans with another big threat a proper massmovie of hollywood with massive action  stunning visualsyou know what youre in for and it deliveres you 10x of thatkong shines as spotlight of the movie while godzilla holds it as a showman  just as a big stars extended cameo appearance the slow motion sequences and over the top action is another competing factor for upcoming indian movies  overall a perfect monster mash with whooping action  visuals  
Apr 12 2024,positive,the monsterverse aint going anywhere
Apr 12 2024,positive,godzilla x kong the new empire unleashes a colossal spectacle thats sure to satisfy fans of monster mayhem with jawdropping visuals and adrenalinepumping action this epic showdown between two iconic titans delivers on its promise of thrills    while the focus is squarely on the epic battles theres enough heart and character depth to keep audiences engaged    director adam wingard crafts a visually stunning and exhilarating ride that earns its place as a standout entry in the monster movie genre for a pulsepounding cinematic experience the new empire reigns supreme    it was a lot better than i thought it was going to be  thats worth something
Apr 12 2024,positive,took my son who is a diehard godzilla fan and both he and the audience were not disappointed we walked in expecting little story but a lot of awesome monster fights and that is exactly what we got great box office junk food and fun was had by all
Apr 12 2024,negative,i felt bored by watching this it just didnt made connect with this film 210
Apr 12 2024,neutral,a good time pass film with average performances and an average story    previous part was much more intense and was far more better than this part    kids will enjoy this film
Apr 12 2024,positive,godzilla x kong the new empire delivers the monstrous mayhem fans crave the cgi is topnotch bringing the titans to life in all their atomicbreathed skyscraperstomping glory the fight sequences are epic but sometimes too short reminding me of godzilla final wars at times    however theres a growing sense that the monsterverse is venturing into familiar territory the plot while serviceable  recycles the threat to humanity trope this time with a mysterious entity from the depths of the earth    this is where we start to see the avengersification of the monsterverse become apparent  theres a sense of setting the stage for a bigger baddie down the line a cosmic kaiju thanos ready to snap his irradiated fingers    while theres nothing wrong with a good oldfashioned brawl between giant lizards and apes  one cant help but wonder if the monsterverse is losing its unique charm so should you see godzilla x kong the new empire absolutely its a popcornmunching extravaganza with enough citycrushing action to satisfy even the most jaded kaiju fan just be prepared for a familiar formula with a hint of what might be coming next
Apr 12 2024,positive,there was a lot of action in movie
Apr 12 2024,negative,very disappointed with this movie lack of thought was put into this and seemed put together in a rush
Apr 12 2024,positive,fun movie for everyone
Apr 12 2024,positive,not as good as the previous one but still vaguely enjoyable
Apr 12 2024,positive,its getting better and better not much dialogue but the storytelling is on point
Apr 12 2024,positive,good movie  and good attention we received
Apr 12 2024,positive,godzilla and kong are great throughout the film but the other characters hardly add anything and just take up unnecessary screen time
Apr 12 2024,positive,really amazing movie you can enjoy the film and feel like a little kid with his imagination brought to life while watching this movie its not a movie made to critique its storytelling ability nor the directors its simply a turn off your brain and enjoy the show type of movie 
Apr 12 2024,positive,the movie theater screen was zoomed in and wasnt able to read the subtitles
Apr 11 2024,positive,i still want to see guy gigan
Apr 11 2024,positive,awesome movie great acting
Apr 11 2024,negative,this movie was terrible my arp ahmad says he hated it        kind regards   syed amir
Apr 11 2024,positive,an improvement over most godzilla movies more screen time throughout the movie for the monsters this had great fight scenes there was less time spent on the people and the dramas of their lives fyi only reviewers care about the relationships of the people fans of titan monsters want the spotlight on the titans
Apr 11 2024,positive,my children and i really liked the movie ending up applauding  when godzilla and kong fought together a good script is not enough for this franchise to be liked i think this movie is not worthy of being evaluated by movie critics if they say bro its a giant lizard and a giant gorilla just enjoy it
Apr 11 2024,negative,i do not like it that much there are too many scenes that monsters fight each other i want it to pay more attention to human part
Apr 11 2024,positive,not only was this movie was amazing but kong has finally become king now he is king kong i can tell in the next sequels its going to led a war between godzilla and king kong
Apr 11 2024,positive,it was awesome and a lot of fun it was entertaining
Apr 11 2024,positive,already watched it twice enjoyed it thoroughly  moneys worth
Apr 11 2024,positive,the first 30 minutes were a bit of a drag but when it gets going and shoves the human characters out of the way its a very fun time at the cinema
Apr 11 2024,positive,amazing it is action packed in true godzilla  kong fashion  the effects were awesome
Apr 11 2024,neutral,ok  so it wasnt great  cant give it a thumbs up  that said the final monster battle was really cool  it couldnt save it but when you can stream it for free fast forward to the battle royale at the end  monstery goodness
Apr 11 2024,negative,i wanted to sleep through the movie but it was too loud so i had to watch it i kept looking at my watch hoping the darn thing would be over soon it was horrible if you want to see godzilla see godzilla minus one
Apr 11 2024,positive,loved it out of the other 4 kong island was awesome and godzilla was kinda dark and slow and godzilla vs kong was awesome this one was the best out of all of them great graphics and baby kong was dope must see
Apr 11 2024,positive,good has big monster fights
Apr 11 2024,negative,i was really disappointed in this movie the plot was confusing and i found it difficult to understand what the actors were saying there were some good special effects and monster fight scenes but i hope they never make another kong movie like this
Apr 11 2024,negative,totally cheesy and full of fan service kong winking at godzilla give me a break godzilla use to be a metaphor for the atomic age and suffering now its just a mockery watch godzilla minus 1 and enjoy a really great movie
Apr 11 2024,positive,the movie was soo good i want to do it again tomorrow
Apr 11 2024,positive,its giant monsters fighting you get what you pay for
Apr 11 2024,positive,not liked loved it  i seen it 3 times
Apr 11 2024,positive,loved it best one ive seen for awhile good story plot and funny scenes loved the action
Apr 11 2024,positive,i like the way the chair reacts to the movie it makes it better it was so much fun its so entertaining
Apr 11 2024,negative,i go to the movies every week and this is the worst movie i have seen in a couple of years  i am embarrassed for the actors   i think it was supposed to be funny at times but fell short of that for sure   my husband and i both had trouble staying awake while viewing  i may go back to the theatre just to see what type of people are buying tickets for it because i cannot believe it has such a high audience rating
Apr 11 2024,negative,didnt finish   looked terrible
Apr 11 2024,positive,i grew up on and love godzilla kong etc the action was solid enough the story telling was not good though it felt like they tried telling the story multiple different ways couldnt decide which way to do it and ended up splitting the baby story was disjointed lacking backstory info poor world building in the story etc but at the end of the day i go to see kaijus fight and that part was enjoyable
Apr 11 2024,positive,its different then the other films lots of action but good in its own way
Apr 10 2024,negative,i cannot believe the current 92 audience score this was the dumbest bigbudget movie ive ever seen and i mean dumb with a capital d absolutely everything was a convenient lazy deus ex machina trope the characters just knew  the explanation for everything that happened and they would just pull it out of their a nothing they say makes any sense at all its just pseudo science fiction with almost no effort theres almost no connection to the original story they started in the first movie is it fun to see the monsters yes does anything make any sense in this movie even a little bit no this script almost legitimately feels like it was generated by ai
Apr 10 2024,positive,super goofy really fun if godzilla minus one was an oscar winner this is its football playing beer chugging poker and hookers cousin
Apr 10 2024,positive,moved along quickly no time to think about being bored
Apr 10 2024,negative,boring and made little to no sense  fell asleep
Apr 10 2024,positive,a fun popcorn flick kong really came across as a fully developed character the humans as usual were the weakest point of the movie but thats okay doesnt hold a candle to godzilla minus one but for a fun saturday matinee movie it was good
Apr 10 2024,positive,i would give this a three and a half but for some reason it wouldnt let me there are other movies in this series that are better but its still a fun movie to go watch
Apr 10 2024,negative,it may be the worst movie i have ever seen
Apr 10 2024,positive,flat characters no real plot
Apr 10 2024,positive,its like watching your action figures came to life fight each other for two hours
Apr 10 2024,positive,action packed never a dull moment
Apr 10 2024,positive,the best feel good movie of the year  this movie has it all great actioncgiacting and a great storyline  a lot of fun from the start and leaves you wanting more im very excited for this new empire cant wait to see where they take it from here 
Apr 10 2024,positive,fun and better than i expected
Apr 10 2024,negative,contrived storyline that tries to merge the unrelated elements of godzilla and kong back stories silly characters including a pet detective and pilots of complex machines are not idiots so why portray them that way  and you have to wade through oceans of nonesense to finally get to the action
Apr 10 2024,positive,really good follow up from the last movie the human interactions were pretty stupid but the monsters scenes were fantastic as long as you dont really pay any attention to any of the human interactions you might have a great movie in your hands
Apr 10 2024,positive,godzilla x kong is not the best entry to the monsterverse but its focus on expanding the character of kong in particular makes for an excellent watch the effects are stunning and the action is great
Apr 10 2024,neutral,if godzilla minus one is a new york strip at a highend steakhouse then godzilla x kong the new empire is a fast food cheeseburger both delicious for vastly different reasons and both having very different strengths and weaknesses     as much as i enjoyed the film you cant help but feel like theres more to be desired here some audiences felt 2014s godzilla was too boring and slow on the reveal of the iconic monster whereas its sequel godzilla king of the monsters struck the perfect balance of a serious tone action drama and humor as this series goes on we seem to drift further from that standard in favor of half baked characters in a wild science fiction world and giving these monsters more of a personality than ever before which id be okay with if the human stories werent so boring     then again im probably being too hard on this one i walked in just wanting to see giant monster mayhem and walked out satisfied if thats your attitude going in then godzilla x kong can be a mindless romp at the movies if you leave wanting more maybe watching minus one again
Apr 10 2024,negative,this movie was worse than bad i am baffled at the semipositive reviews it was just awfulthe closest ive come to walking out of a movie in years cardboard set designs in some cases terrible plot illdefined antagonist even after it ended i dont know who the antagonist was supposed to be i suspect that they were trying to trick us into thinking that godzilla was the antagonist and then surprise us when it cooperates with kong but they gave that part away in the preview sheesh the movie starts out okay but then completely falls apart when it breaks story formula and fails to identify an antagonist or what needs to be resolved
Apr 10 2024,negative,godzilla minus one is to jaws what gxkk is to the meg silly story the sfx are good but get overblown to make up for a lack of story hollow earth has an even more hollower earth really scraping the bottom of the barrel really weird pacing too obviously one of these cochinese produced movies this series started off great now it needs to end no more please
Apr 10 2024,positive,took my nephew to see it think i ended up enjoying it more than him super easy to follow plot and non stop action really entertaining movie
Apr 10 2024,positive,great audio  cool effects
Apr 10 2024,positive,the new empire is a fun experience for fans of the two biggest monster heroes but some action sequences make the film feels a little too chaotic to earn a higher level
Apr 10 2024,positive,really good movie trailer made it look pretty cheesy but me and my kids thoroughly enjoyed it
Apr 10 2024,positive,this is  amazing   but there is a issue movie length soo short   when kong and godzilla fiyth togather  maybe this sequanc want more long
Apr 10 2024,positive,exactly what you would expect from a monster movie  nothing spectacular outside of the special effects just a good entertaining film
Apr 10 2024,positive,this movie was full of action from beginning to ending
Apr 10 2024,positive,omg loved this movie it was just so cool  really enjoyed the soundtrack to it too yes it was slow sometimes but not for very long before the action hit high speed id see it again also
Apr 10 2024,positive,love the action needed a soda refill but didnt want to miss a thing
Apr 10 2024,positive,i really love this movie than kung fu panda 4 it so good like how we get  a backstory of the surfaces world the hollow earth  live in harmony then skar king destroyed the peace and started the war between the titans and how godzilla  blast all the kongs down to hollow earth and how he met shimo the fights were amazing i love how godzilla fights shimo and mothra helping godzilla fights shimo i do love how mothra returns after king of the monsters   and i like how evil skar king was when he reach the surface world and roared at the people this movie may have good human realtionship is not good but we get to see more on the kaiju part more which is really good
Apr 10 2024,positive,it was surprisingly good once they quickly built the story it really took off i found very few scenes corny which i easily do for a lot the previous ones but i was really happy with how they handled this one  action was on point bits of comedy were comical etc id watch it again the cg was top tier
Apr 10 2024,positive,it was a fantastic movie  packed with thrill and adventure where fearsome godzilla and almighty kong fought against a colossal undiscovered threat hidden within our world
Apr 10 2024,negative,movie was trash enough with them being on the same team getting played out hour in to the movie and they arent even seen together yet

Apr 10 2024,positive,it was a very enjoyable movie for me
Apr 10 2024,positive,loved it it was my first godzilla and kong movie i had seen and it was perfect overall i loved the story and seeing godzilla and kong on screen was very entertaining plus kong throwing that baby kong around was hilarious
Apr 10 2024,positive,the action and cgi were excellent the only issue i ever have with these movies are the amount of screen time the humans have in comparison to godzilla and king kong
Apr 10 2024,positive,amazing by far the best entry in the series finally got the formula perfect incredible fight scenes between titans and only a few human characters to move the plot forward without being a nuisance
Apr 10 2024,neutral,very entertaining but story seemed rushed with a very bad ending and kinda like a cashgrab
Apr 10 2024,positive,want to see a monster movie that isnt focused on human drama then this is the movie for you it has huge destructive kaiju action that is pure fun tons of action scenes for fans to enjoy cant wait to see the next team up with godzilla and kong 
Apr 10 2024,positive,big monster fighting each other what more are you looking for
Apr 10 2024,positive,it was a great movie
Apr 10 2024,positive,shakespeare no  fun yes
Apr 10 2024,positive,this was action action  and more action for any konggodzilla  fan  you must see
Apr 10 2024,positive,i absolutely loved every moment of this movie i dont want to give any details away but i will say that the story line was fantastic the actors all did amazing jobs and the graphics was absolutely breathtakingly exquisite if i could give this movie ten stars i would   
Apr 10 2024,positive,i really loved this movie
Apr 10 2024,negative,horrible plot horrible acting
Apr 10 2024,positive,godzilla x kong the new empire gives some new insights into the monsterverse with new and old characters to boot though its dialogue is growlheavy the titanfighting more than make up for it i enjoyed this side of godzilla and kong thoroughly its a great movie to just sit back and enjoy
Apr 10 2024,positive,great fight scenes classic sounds updated from older movies godzilla pulls a wwe move with setting in the big screen bought the tickets through fandango and got a deal of a five pack digital godzilla movies in vudu
Apr 10 2024,positive,movie was so good and loved the right scenes story wasnt too long and it was all together very exciting
Apr 9 2024,positive,all the action non stop
Apr 9 2024,positive,a great monster movie  the focus was the action between the monsters which was the best part of the movie  a lot of things that didnt make sense but keep in mind this is a movie about giant monsters roaming the earth with us  its not a great movie but it was a fun watch
Apr 9 2024,positive,it is what it is just a big monster movie
Apr 9 2024,positive,incredible cgi  in some ways best ive ever seen    movie itself conveluded with a very small plot    its not explained why but for some reason towards the end a bad monster becomes good and thats that for sure entertaining but leave your brain at the door 
Apr 9 2024,positive,it was good as hhellll
Apr 9 2024,negative,the acting was sincere but too stereotyped  story was weak  they tried too hard to get the three main monsters on screen without much thought going into the reason  lots of fighting without much purpose  monsters had too many human characteristics
Apr 9 2024,positive,nothing new in this movie
Apr 9 2024,positive,this movie was fun campy and spring fun me and my daughter had fun you did have fun journey with kong but it was fun
Apr 9 2024,positive,what can i  say i am an huge  godzilla fan i am in my sixties and have been following him since i was a wee one  major props to godzilla  kong and mothra  outstanding movie and a must see keep them coming godzilla
Apr 9 2024,positive,i liked the general story line about an inner earth however i found the movie to be a tedious and slow going also it was too reminiscent of the planet of the apes for which im not a fan
Apr 9 2024,positive,i loved this movie its probably my favorite that ive seen in a very long time some things in the movie dont make entirely logical sense but its a bunch of giant gorillasapes and giant lizard dragons things fighting each other it doesnt need to make sense its super action packed and fun id recommend watching it
Apr 9 2024,positive,a decent movie typical popcorn action blockbuster  put your brain at off and enjoy    it some points it just felt too much kaiju with personalities and feelings is just weird and also some action scenes were really bad    on the positive side some music choices were awesome i loved the addition of trapper and godzilla can german suplex better than any current wwe wrestler haha
Apr 9 2024,neutral,entertaining and a good hour of not thinking about real life  original few godzilla and kong movies in this recent series were stories with a plot and character development  most recent movies have been just about throwing a ton of monsters on the screen for cgi battle royale
Apr 9 2024,positive,if youre a godzilla or a kong fan this is the perfect film for you its packed to the brim with action between godzillakongskar king etc i do love the references to the showa era of godzilla which they add in very well kudos to adam wingard now for the people who are comparing this movie to minus one please understand that minus one which is also a great film is a depressing and dark side to godzilla just like in the first godzilla back in 1954 godzilla x kong the new empire is a action and a fun movie for people to see the other side of godzilla which is what the showa era was as well but most important of all we got see doug again but over all as a godzilla and a kong fan i would give this a 1010 and i highly recommend to watch this film
Apr 9 2024,positive,was a very enjoyable movie even my friends that never seen a godzilla movie enjoyed
Apr 9 2024,negative,stupid plot it was disappointing
Apr 9 2024,positive,the one of the few movies in recent memory that makes you want to see it again
Apr 9 2024,positive,plenty of kaiju action which is what you want in a monsterverse movie but godzilla is more of a side character with a lot less screen time but his character development is done well skar king is an ultimate villain with the most character out of all monsterverse villains but shimo is just skar kings pet in this movie her character doesnt have enough development and good moments the human characters in this movie are a step up from godzilla vs kong they have more to do in this movie in my opinion the best part of this movie is the connection between kong and suko and how it builds throughout the movie writing wise its ok but it could have been better but overall its a good buddy cop movie
Apr 9 2024,positive,absolutely the best monsterverse movie
Apr 9 2024,positive,an exciting movie with lots of monster action  a great escape
Apr 9 2024,positive,i really liked it and my son loved it
Apr 9 2024,positive,the movie was beastyyy so good
Apr 9 2024,positive,i love the movie so much
Apr 9 2024,positive,the universe of godzilla and kong new empire has nothing to do with the films we saw as children i know this was predictable but it is important to confirm although he keeps the battles and destruction at a high level the scripts approach the aesthetic construction of the protagonists and villains and the constructed photography left me with the feeling of watching a cartoon for preteens the big monsters are there the way we like them but they are not well used especially in relation to their strength in relation to the cities and local inhabitants for metropolitan scenes are superficial and shallow in short a youthful adventure where godzilla almost plays a supporting role to kong the work drags on average and if it does rating 610
Apr 9 2024,positive,lots of action really enjoyed the movie exceeded my expectations would recommend to others
Apr 9 2024,positive,maganda naman yung movie kaso nakakabitin need more screentime sa mga titan pero worth it parin panoorin sana 2 hours plus na sa susunod na sequel like king of monsters
Apr 9 2024,positive,good movie great sound effects 
Apr 9 2024,positive,once again the monsterverse delivers a kaiju fighting spectacle  new villains additions to the backstory of the hollow earth whats not to like
Apr 9 2024,positive,amazing cinematic experience definitely a jaw dropping experience i know there many reviews saying they had bad seats or it wasnt for 3d etc watching it in a regular theatre is the way to go  the cgi on the titians was incredible the whole movie choreography was on point for a movie of big monster fighting people may also say its a pointless movie but this movie was meant for entertainment and excitement you get that the entire movie
Apr 9 2024,positive,ayo this movie is golden lol theres nothing like big fucking kaiju battles to get the adrenaline pumping nice blend of laughs and seriousness they couldve put a teensy bit more fighting to talk ratio but all in all is a knockout when it comes to giant monster movies
Apr 9 2024,positive,it was a good movie may recommend
Apr 9 2024,positive,this movie was awesome
Apr 9 2024,positive,great movie with great visuals
Apr 9 2024,negative,movie did not look 3d or imax seats were decaying  we were given childrens glasses in the beginning
Apr 9 2024,negative,good lord what an absolute mess they made a godzilla fast and the furious many of the scenes gave no scale to the pure size of these creatures could have saved money and just put actors back in the monster suits hey hollywood go watch godzilla minus one and learn something
Apr 9 2024,positive,will watch again on steaming channels when available
Apr 9 2024,neutral,this couldve and shouldve been so much better    this movie has way too much it is so chaotic no king kong or godzilla should be like this having king kong and godzilla be so normal to the world and practically being friends with people is a unique approach for the film    the idea was bad but it was done so well everything else was done greatly they couldnt have done a better representation  of what they were trying to do the comedic aspects were solid aswell
Apr 9 2024,positive,great visuals as usual a love able companion mothras return and its a team up not verses movie pure epic
Apr 9 2024,positive,i liked it it was paced well kinda liked mini kong now kong is a pseudo parent and even has a kick ass new pet shimo there were some cringe worthy scenes like the wwf suplex and kong catching a ride on godzilla but loved how they made mothra look it was a very beautiful movie very scenic hollow earth never lets me down i liked this way more than the previous godzilla vs kong that movie was fair but i was not fan of the mecha godzilla as the villain thats just me
Apr 8 2024,positive,yet again my 8 year old son picked another fabulous movie we definitely enjoy our movies and our time we get to spend together this is our favorite thing to do its maybe our 10 or 12th movie in about one and a hang years love the location and the theaters he likes to talk during movies so i absolutely like the fact that you can check on how busy the movie will be half the movies we go to  they are slim to no people in our time slot i like to plan it that was though best for everyone he only talks about the movie but still
Apr 8 2024,positive,all ive got to say is this was one amazing and great movie i took three families and one girl said she didnt like movies like this till she watched it and she absolutely loved it and we are 100 ready for the next one plz make the next ones action top this one
Apr 8 2024,positive,the action packed story line the special effects  the plot
Apr 8 2024,positive,some of the human scenes were unnecessary but overall it was a great monster movie loved the fight scenes cgi was really good
Apr 8 2024,positive,expected high  and didnt disappoint 
Apr 8 2024,positive,this movie was fricking epic i watched it with some freinds and i came out amused there was so much monster action in this movie and kong fans are going to love this one because kong had so much screen time my one down side is mothra and godzilla should have had more screen time
Apr 8 2024,positive,this movie was really fun to see it had some downs into it like godzilla not having too much screen time but it makes sense for a movie mostly focusing on kong and its species but godzilla still had a good role in this movie so that was good it was fun to watch ill say and it had quite a lot of action pack into this one if youre a fan of these type of movies then theres a high a chance youll have fun too
Apr 8 2024,positive,i loved the parallel of the two main characters godzilla and kong the comedic relief was great  people need to understand that movies are sometimes just meant to be fun and not over analyzed just had a blast
Apr 8 2024,positive,godzilla x kong is a pefect monster movie it has more monsters on screen than humans and the battles are amazing a must watch
Apr 8 2024,positive,as usual these movies have weak plotwriting especially for the humans the exposition of the plot mostly towards the end was very annoying its a simple plot we dont need it explained the monster action was fun and entertaining
Apr 8 2024,positive,good action and they didnt use too much comedy
Apr 8 2024,positive,godzilla x kong the new empire is a thrilling cinematic experience that combines breathtaking visuals electrifying action and pulsepounding spectacle leaving audiences craving more
Apr 8 2024,positive,i wish there was more time to develop the human characters and the musics could be more memorable but the movie was beautiful kong was a total badass and godzilla unstoppable
Apr 8 2024,positive,it delivered the effects and monster battles but gave some nice human characters to the story that wove together mythology backstory and suggested some more movies in this franchises future
Apr 8 2024,positive,action packed i took my son to see this movie and we both loved it the story line was good the dialogue was a little lackluster but the action scenes made up for it
Apr 8 2024,positive,exciting and adventures
Apr 8 2024,positive,the first godzilla movie ive seen but i love it this movie had a lot of fights and they were good you must see right now godzilla had rizz
Apr 8 2024,positive,it was a good movie i enjoyed it
Apr 8 2024,positive,so much fun just a sit back eat some popcorn and enjoy the action fun it was like a big budget 80s movie slightly corny in spots but fast paced and a plot that just keeps the story moving forward at a fast pace and plenty of action     loved every second of it i seriously wonder if the director wanted it to be an 80s homage the music and plenty of 80s movies references
Apr 8 2024,positive,if you just want action and like the monsterverse then this is what youre looking for the movie was just made for fun and its not trying to make any statement
Apr 8 2024,positive,as a godzilla fan for 30 years this was the most fun i had at the theater my kids said it was the most fun they had in the movies must see in 3d
Apr 8 2024,positive,love it as a fan of the big g hope to see the monsterverse make even more growth in the story line
Apr 8 2024,neutral,the action was fun the acting was terrible the story was so ridiculously far fetched
Apr 8 2024,positive,i liked the action however got confused in the plot
Apr 8 2024,positive,movie is peak all these pdf files critics can cry abt it
Apr 8 2024,positive,this is a monster movie plain and simple i had a tremendous amount of fun and everything i was hopingexpecting was there i look at the japanese movies more for the human story and the american movies i actually like how they focus on the monsters more thats what i want big monsters fighting i dont care how dumb others might say it is if you like big kaiju movies youll have fun seeing this
Apr 8 2024,positive,i enjoyed it and i love it
Apr 8 2024,positive,what a great movie for fans of the series action packed goos story looks fantastic no boring bits just straight up action and bonkers set pieces loved it
Apr 8 2024,positive,this was really awesome packed with top notch monster action however the cgi in the godzilla and scylla scene was meh it looked unfinished so not so great with the all the special effects but definitely the rest of them were great the story didnt happen as big as i thought it would be and i expected skar king to be taller
Apr 8 2024,positive,i loved it so much it was so good  10 out of 10   watch in imax 3d
Apr 8 2024,positive,it was really animated ill give it a c rating maybe a c the movie theater stopped the movie six times trying to adjust the sound and then they let it play for five minutes with no sound it was very frustrating and then i ordered a drink and it took them 20 minutes to bring it to me i havent been to the movies since covid this was my first time back was not impressed

Apr 8 2024,positive,awesome movie baby kong stole the show
Apr 8 2024,positive,if youre looking for a good time and just want to watch mindless monster brawling this is your movie even better if you can watch with other godzilla fans or friends
Apr 8 2024,positive,a childhood dream  full of action and more monster scenes felt like watching an old godzilla film
Apr 8 2024,positive,the most fun ive had seeing a movie in theaters in a long time 75 kaiju 25 human the perfect balance in this type of movie i wanted to see giant monsters fighting and godzilla showing us why hes still the king and gxk did not disappoint
Apr 8 2024,positive,i had a lotta fun with this movie despite some minor flaws starting with the negatives the human subplots still are not great here its definitely a lot better than previous outings  and it is a lot more of a nonissue here but it does slog down the pacing when it goes on a bit too long aside from that the continuing mythology of the monsterverse is a lotta fun and ties things together in a way thats not too convoluted which is a huge plus the best thing this movie has going for it is easily how much more they lean into the more cartoony side of these monsters the amount of creativity thats squeezed out from the fight scenes is a lot of fun and they do take up just the right amount of screentime i really hope we continue to go this direction with future movies under warner bros because i think its a huge improvement over godzilla vs kong and other previous monsterverse movies
Apr 8 2024,positive,i find it funny how the majority of the critics snobs score this film so low yet the audience actual fans of godzillakong are near 95 it was a good watch good story worth the price of admission definitely not a let down and definitely not 52 do yourself a favor and see it in the theater
Apr 8 2024,positive,great special effects good action fun times
Apr 8 2024,positive,i took my 9 year old daughter shes pretty girly i thought she wouldnt like it but she loved it and as for myself i liked it as well in the end when they are all fighting the scene was pretty cool
Apr 8 2024,positive,i love it very good movie to watch in 2024
Apr 8 2024,positive,humans took a backseat kept it mostly about the creatures some things didnt make sense some things were too convenient fun overall
Apr 8 2024,positive,it was alright storyline seemed a bit grade but it was a fun watch
Apr 8 2024,positive,what an awesome movie to have kong and godzilla to set aside their differences and have them fighting together absolutely amazing
Apr 8 2024,positive,it was great definitely a much needed twist from the previous gk movies the storyline was told mostly by the humans because who else would tell it gk dont speak ignore the one star critics and go see it for yourself

Apr 8 2024,positive,loads of action exactly what i expected good ole fashion fun

Apr 8 2024,positive,silly and not serious strictly for children when will we learn from the japanese godzilla minus one was far superior
Apr 7 2024,positive,my buddy kristian harloff from the best entertainment podcast the big thing said it best if youre excited about this movie and you read or hear a review whose major point is in this movie you dont care about the humans disregard it and see it anyway those people are going into this movie with the wrong mindset and they dont really want to see a kaiju aka giant monster movie of course the human story doesnt matter its not their story i also have a counterpoint i did care about the humans they are a great complement to the true stars of this flick godzilla kong and mothra godizilla minus 1 was an anomaly not even the original 1954 flick had the human story that minus 1 this is not a comparable flick this movie is so much fun and i am loving this monsterverse including the kurt and wyatt russell led tv series monarch it all started with gareth edwards godzilla in 2014 i eagerly await godzilla and kongs next adventure
Apr 7 2024,positive,the movie was great
Apr 7 2024,positive,very good story and great action
Apr 7 2024,positive,pretty good movie the only reason i see is to see the big battle of godzilla or king kong cgi was pretty good but i liked it

Apr 7 2024,positive,fun mindless fun a film that doesnt take itself seriously and has some great moments

Apr 7 2024,positive,a fun movie experience that personalizes kong a little more as long as you dont read into the plot to much it is a fun movie experience with great special effects
Apr 7 2024,positive,there was more action and a good story i loved godzilla vs kong but the human side of the story was weak not very interesting this time there was a good balance and the human story made sense and flowed with the whole plot will watch again
Apr 7 2024,positive,the movie was amazing
Apr 7 2024,positive,just fun this is old school godzilla movies where all you want to see is monsters fight

Apr 7 2024,positive,this movie is pure entertainment it is awsomeskar king is a cool villan
Apr 7 2024,positive,great all around movie from start to finish
Apr 7 2024,positive,i literally have nothing to say about godzilla x kong the new empire what you expected is exactly what you get a lot of cgi monsters carnage and destruction with little bits of human drama that doesnt stack up to the rest of the film i will credit the movie for making each monster feel like they have real human emotions though you can really tell what theyre saying through their gestures and body language i personally preferred the godzilla x kong v mechagodzilla fight over these ones but you get a lot more fighting throughout this film at long last we have just about a clean 5050 split between human and monster stories that being said the humans are still fairly lame but not as cumbersome as they were in say king of the monsters there was a decent motheradopted daughter thread balanced with a boring ancient tribe plot see pretty much what youd expect from a new installment in universals monsterverse but i will say i love how by the fifth movie people just live their lives like normal despite knowing that there are titans everywhere and they could get crushed by a building whenever they walk into work tomorrow its kinda funny 3 out of 5 but i appreciate it for giving me what i wanted to see
Apr 7 2024,positive,so i just watched this movie and wow this is just a amazing movie the monster action is just perfect however i do think the first 30 minutes are kind of a stretch but either way this is a really good movie i dont care what the critics say this is perfect
Apr 7 2024,positive,was epic on every level more action than the previous entry and more thrilling youre here to see kaijus fight each other to the death if you are expecting anything else then this movie is not for you
Apr 7 2024,positive,kong and godzilla made me want to watch it in the cinema
Apr 7 2024,positive,godzillaxkong is my favorite movie by far i will say this to those bad critics you are a few but we the fans are many
Apr 7 2024,positive,if you liked the other kong and godzilla movies youll love this one
Apr 7 2024,positive,a modern mythological like epic
Apr 7 2024,positive,good movie good theatre
Apr 7 2024,positive,monsters actually fighting and humans are not the main plot  physics doesnt apply love it
Apr 7 2024,positive,good action packed film great pacing along with the build up to the climatic battle enjoyed the retro angles when battling in the urban cities
Apr 7 2024,positive,amazing action and effects the fights were fun and funny the human side of the plot doesnt overstay its welcome and and godzilla and kong are the main stars as they should be
Apr 7 2024,positive,oh my i grew up on godzilla and king kong and all the other titans like mothra
Apr 7 2024,positive,awesome movie great story and lots of action first time seeing a movie in dolby sound and vibration sync to the movie 1010
Apr 7 2024,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed the movie a nice mix of comedic scenes while still holding the more serious aspects of action and there is one complaint although there is a decent amount of human characters and human screen time i wish there was a little bit more also i was overjoyed to see the ace ventura reference because that was exactly what i thought of trapper even before it was mentioned
Apr 7 2024,positive,this is the best movie that ive seen in a  long time  from start to finish i loved it
Apr 7 2024,positive,i need fanart of godzilla napping on the great wonders on of the world stat
Apr 7 2024,positive,71  after the epic spectacle that was godzilla vs kong this next installment does its best in a modern industry of horrid sequels that dont do justice to the iconic characters within  what id like to point out is the fact that the majority of characters from the previous installments are nowhere to be found for some reason this film felt somewhat empty in terms of familiar faces  also despite the heavy advertisement godzilla is only in the film for a fraction of kongs screentime godzilla was simply a convenient ally to the ape situation in hollow earth where a noticeably large chunk of the movie is set  at some point i just dumbed myself down in order to enjoy what was essentially becoming a superhero movie complete with an infinity gauntlet thing for kong and a hilarious shot of kong with the gauntlet and godzilla running beside each other to face the villain of the day without my analytical expectations for a good movie to get in the way this film becomes an actionheavy effectsfest with impressive visuals and more development for kong and his fellow apes than anyone else  side note i really wish they didnt trash the pyramids like that the aliens are probably pissed
Apr 7 2024,positive,a fantastic godzillakong entry to the monster verse a must see  
Apr 7 2024,neutral,it was predictable plot had alot of holes it was visually great and heart warming as well worth watching once and then never again
Apr 7 2024,positive,loved it felt like an old school goofy godzilla movie from when i was a kid with modern visuals
Apr 7 2024,positive,the people subplot was cumbersome actors were good just the plot wasnt for me wish godzilla had more screentime great experience overall
Apr 7 2024,positive,movies graphics were very detailed  and wasnt the same old destroy tokyo  it went all over to different realms lots of action  good story telling 
Apr 7 2024,positive,fantastic story and world building all the action i could ask for this film really delivers what it says on the tin
Apr 7 2024,positive,nothing like a teamwork to defeat the evil
Apr 7 2024,positive,if youre a fan of the godzilla franchise going back to the 60s you will love this film
Apr 7 2024,positive,exactly what i wanted would have loved a little more godzilla but his low screen time only added to the actual scenes he was in a lot of fun and highly recommend seeing if you like other godzilla and kong movies
Apr 7 2024,positive,i think the movie was absolutely great and the gci is increbible the fight scenes are great and i cant wait for another one to come out
Apr 7 2024,positive,saw this movie in 3d and was blown away the cgi effect was amazing and the acting was intentional there were some cringe moments like how the native people looked asian and were kind to outsiders as if that happens some of the lines were amusing and others you rolled your eyes at but with every earlier godzilla and king kong movies there was always some cringe and some shrug of the shoulders that is what made this genre of movies so well liked  monster mashups i would love to see another installment would definitely watch this movie again
Apr 7 2024,positive,was good a lot of action just little to much talking
Apr 7 2024,positive,such a good movie love it
Apr 7 2024,negative,plot was very bad visual effects were good there is no story villan was not intimidating
Apr 7 2024,positive,way too much was happening imo it felt like i was watching 34 different movies all in one felt really jumbled overall i did enjoy the special effects and the final 20ish minutes
Apr 7 2024,positive,just what i wanted more monsters fighting kong is king
Apr 7 2024,positive,this movie was a blast to watch  storyline was very simple  kaiju actions was great  vfx was outstanding considering the the amount of kaijutitans fight shown for the production budget   this movie wont win any oscar awards but will keep you entertained   this is not godzilla minus one  thats  a totally different film  it should not be compare to this one   this film is over the top fun and sillyall in a awesome way  just walk in the theater with low expectations and an open mind and you will leave the theater with a smile on your face  enjoy
Apr 7 2024,positive,loud and proud exactly what it should be huge amount of action and of course absolutely no story line but thats cool we never went to the imax to watch a story 
Apr 7 2024,positive,kid and i enjoyed less weird than the classic
Apr 7 2024,negative,its basically a movie for kids  the plot is very stupid  the dialogue is overly descriptive and unnatural  they just say whats happening out loud
Apr 7 2024,negative,absolutely horrible this movie made no sense i lterally cant find words to explain what was going on your money is too valuable to waste it on this movie
Apr 7 2024,positive,it did its job it entertained me
Apr 7 2024,negative,this is one of those movies where the critics are right but so are the kids and others looking for a good time at the movies if youre growing up and the fantasy action genre marvel movies are your drink then this will not disappoint gxk follows a similar marvel universe formula as the comedy unrealism heavy cgi and quick pacecome together to nicely get you to the finish for others this movie will more likely be met with a more critical eye and fail in many categories
Apr 7 2024,positive,awesome movie please make more
Apr 7 2024,positive,this was great     better than expected
Apr 7 2024,positive,i enjoy it it exciting  funny n sad
Apr 7 2024,positive,i loved it because i grew up with king kong and godzilla  my son 44 didnt care for it because he has never seen the old movies of king kong and godzilla  i love how kind king kong was until he wasnt  i loved the 3d it did make me jump a couple of times  i loved everything about it  thanks
Apr 7 2024,positive,this movie wouldve been a 55 if they removed every single human scene except for bernie and trapper that being said godzilla sleeping in the colosseum better be a recurring thing throughout every single movie easily the second best part of this film first being godzilla x kong vs scar king x shimo greatest movie of 2024 easy
Apr 7 2024,neutral,the movie opened with a fantastic pace and kept it up through out what i was able to watch i was devastated when a part of the soundtrack started and then my head started with traumatic flashbacks because of the song used and i left the theatre in pieces its not one im considering watching again even to see how it ends  i wish studios would put sound and soundtrack warnings for those with sensitive auditorypsychological problems  or at least release a full list of the soundtrack as part of the movies information when looking at booking tickets
Apr 7 2024,negative,what the hell is this garbage movie
Apr 7 2024,positive,it was fun but felt that the pacing was too fast i was yearning for slow build up to fights more godzilla and kong movies please
Apr 7 2024,positive,godzilla standing on business for 2 hours straight
Apr 7 2024,positive,the 4dx was a nice different experience  i felt like if i was at a disney world ride at universal studios  i saw the movie  at regal times square ny  i would say my complaint would be the volume i felt like the volume was too low compared to previous movies like the last godzilla or transformers movie  if you go def dont buy alot of food like i did because seats are stadium like and hardly any room basically trying to hold onto your food while moving around
Apr 7 2024,negative,i was driving from modesto to san diego and stopped in los angeles  figured id watch a movie to rest  this seemed like an easy movie to watch while getting some rest  always loved kong growing up  this movie was barely above boring  the acting was actually semidecent  however kong looked barely better than a cartoon character  a very forgettable movie  would an adult watch this on their own  no unless you were in my shoes  a decent kids movie but definitely not for adults   at least it didnt have a hidden message in it
Apr 7 2024,neutral,youll like it if you liked the previous monsterverse films it has its cool moments i guess but overall it was whatever godzilla deserves a better movie than this poor guy
Apr 7 2024,negative,muddled plot reasonably good special effects all in all not very good
Apr 7 2024,negative,one of the worst movie ever made by humans the production company is hiring bots to put fake 5 stars on this site the movie is nonsensical and absolute garbage idiotic just seems written by chatgpt with zero creative intent its like every day they just put whatever the intern made on blender in the movie now here we remove a tooth from a monke now here were in antartica doing who knows what charging energies now heres a swarm of giant wasp now here are big cocoon of magic that you kinda can go through but we dont really now what they are etc it just goes on and on with utter trash also people litterally teleport in this movie from one side of the globe to another the editing is one of the worst thing ive ever witness at some point there is a scene with a submarine that is spliced in half and the second clip barely has time to flash on the screen ive never seen such a jarring terrible edit the submarine flashes and just blows up like wtf are you doing with the edit xd the main child actor cant speak and its stupid but everyone can read her mind and she knows exactly where to go like shes got a compass in her brain that leads to the end of the movie i do not believe so many people are rating this movie 5 stars they are bots or humanity is doomed as a specied because our kind has mushed its brain matter so much on tik tok that it nows enjoys this steaming pile of d gshit
Apr 7 2024,positive,great movie loved the fight scenes  the graphics too definitely a must see

Apr 7 2024,positive,action packed  loved it
Apr 7 2024,negative,its such a shame that a cinema icon as classic as godzilla has become an absolute joke a franchise run by people with the minds of children and an embarrassment to the legacy of toho in the span of six months i have now seen both the best and the worst godzilla has to offer and this film is by far the worst
Apr 7 2024,positive,good follow up to the monsterverse

Apr 7 2024,positive,movie was awesome and packed with action
Apr 7 2024,positive,not bad but i felt like the trailers did much to spoil the movie and all that was left was to see where and how those clips were pieced together nothing really shocked me in the way of surprise but i did have a few laughs and hope if another monsterverse film is released it does better to drop my jaw

Apr 7 2024,positive,really liked it i like how they made kong act like an actual character not just some guy destroying everything in this way i also liked that skar king had personality and his vibes gave me goosebumps this movie is supposed to be a fun blockbuster movie and it succeeds on that the only downsides i have is they shouldve done more with the villains and human characterstory wasnt the best
Apr 7 2024,positive,awesome movie a lot of action
Apr 7 2024,positive,they literally added all the action plus some
Apr 7 2024,positive,cgi was great the fights were both epic and funny at times there were even a few spots epic enough to be jaw dropping its a big cgi monster fight thats why were here it delivered on everything it should

Apr 7 2024,positive,godzilla x kong was a super fun movie and i just loved it

Apr 7 2024,positive,this movie was so fun
Apr 7 2024,negative,american trash and nonsense only the japanese can make godzilla films

Apr 6 2024,positive,the new empire is a fun and entertaining ride a good successor to the godzilla vs kong movie with good visual effects fight scenes and monsters  the monster interactions are great and all the action the movie has makes you stick to the screen  for sure would recommend everyone to watch it principally for fans of monster movies
Apr 6 2024,positive,normally not really into this type of movie but my son wanted to watch it so we went and let me tell you if this movie is an indication of what i have missed i am definitely gonna watch the othered too must watch
Apr 6 2024,positive,less humans more animals definitely a family film made for kids a ton of action
Apr 6 2024,positive,rotten tomato critics are idiots of course its a monster mash of a movie and thats exactly what people wanted if you wanna go see great special effects with king kong and godzilla kicking ass then go see the movie if you were hoping for shakespeare because youre a snobby critic then stay the hell home
Apr 6 2024,positive,really great movie with a captivating story and filled to the brim with action my eyes were glued to the screen the whole time
Apr 6 2024,positive,loved all the action

Apr 6 2024,positive,it was an awesome escape to enjoy instead of life
Apr 6 2024,positive,the movie plot was very good but it could have used a longer ending scene
Apr 6 2024,positive,the science is completely unbelievable but if you turn your brain off for 2 hours its a good time
Apr 6 2024,positive,im a fan of godzilla  kong  i like it it shouldve been longer its a good  movie
Apr 6 2024,positive,this film was exactly what i expected it to be weak on story strong on action and destruction and as a result i enjoyed it for what it was like the previous movies its a classic turn your brain off experience its no cinematic masterpiece and if you go in thinking that it will be youll strongly dislike it but its an entertaining slugfest of nonstop action involving the two most famous movie monsters of alltime wish godzilla had a little more screentime though
Apr 6 2024,positive,1010 would recommend this movie to everyone im not a fan of these kinds of movies but my son wanted to watch and im glad i did go watch
Apr 6 2024,positive,liked the story line and the action in the movie
Apr 6 2024,positive,movie geared to a stage 8 year old plot was predictable and the special effects were repetitive and boring definitely not worth the price of admission
Apr 6 2024,positive,i enjoyed it watching the beasts destroy cities is the best part not as good as the first two and not nearly as good as the recent japanese godzilla
Apr 6 2024,positive,loved every minute of this movie  best godzilla kong in existence  action packed throughout the whole movie  good flow and storyline
Apr 6 2024,negative,one dimensional and uninspired admittedly im not the demographic for this movie
Apr 6 2024,positive,it was good  it was slow at the beginning and got better
Apr 6 2024,neutral,cliched characters  over the top cgi  after watching godzilla minus one this pales in comparison
Apr 6 2024,positive,great spectacle lots of monster stomping and excitement
Apr 6 2024,positive,godzilla x kong the new empire was pretty good but the beginning was very dragged out
Apr 6 2024,positive,you know what youre going to get these godzillakong movies no they arent going to win any academy awards yes theyre a bit silly but theyre still extremely fun this latest one the same as the others that came before youll enjoy it if you know what the formula is and dont expect it to be more that it ever will be
Apr 6 2024,positive,pretty cool titans battling throughout what else do you need
Apr 6 2024,positive,first one was better in my opinion fight scenes are too short and there wasnt too much of a plot to follow visually amazing though
Apr 6 2024,positive,very fun movie not gonna win any oscars or anything but its 2hrs of fun and thats what inwany from these movie  wish there was more of godzilla of course
Apr 6 2024,positive,full of action never a dull moment
Apr 6 2024,negative,people were actually leaving the cinema it was so cheesy
Apr 6 2024,positive,i love it its was super good 
Apr 6 2024,negative,on a visual level the film is striking however the plot and character development is minimal and far too often the battle sequences were two minutes too long
Apr 6 2024,positive,great action but a bit silly
Apr 6 2024,positive,i loved this movie i saw it on opening day with friends even though godzilla was put into a worse form he is still super cool in this movie but i hope he reverts back to how he was i really liked scar king and his back story but they did not pun enough time into it i am really excited to see what becomes of the community of kongs in the next movie on a side note i loved to see  mothra again i hope this means thermo may come back
Apr 6 2024,positive,its a good monster movie for me that it makes me want more of it i might be really satisfied if it was a 2 hours or 3 hours long movie
Apr 6 2024,positive,fantastic and entertaining from start to finish not 5 stars cuz it was a lil difficult to follow fast fight scenes yes most of the action takes place toward the end but the story is welldriven
Apr 6 2024,positive,my favorite out of the latest godzilla and kong movies the special effects and colors were next level if you can see this in 3d you should
Apr 6 2024,positive,i not a huge fan of the monsterverse movies but i just thought id check this one out overall it was mostly good i liked how all the monsters looked i did think though that the ending could have been better because it seemed pretty abrupt
Apr 6 2024,positive,its more kongs movie than godzillas but it was still great
Apr 6 2024,positive,dont listen to the overrated critics that think they actually know anything they nitpick every little thing why do we go to the movies to escape and enter a different world to be entertained this movie dose exactly that its entertaining it smashes outside the box of normal boring logic normal is a setting on the dryer so why would you want a normal average drama movie when you can come into this world called the monsterverse this movie has plenty more titan action and not as much human drama as the previous films the human drama thats there ends up connecting to the return of a titan that wasnt advertised which was a great surprise without this titan godzilla and kong would of probably tried to kill each other the plot is centered around 2 rival titans coming together to fight a common enemy that wants to escape hollow earth and wreak havoc on the surface theres definitely plenty of titan vs titan action involving 5 main titans and one cute little titan is it a perfect film no but no film actually is i was definitely entertained and looking forward to seeing it again
Apr 6 2024,positive,its a fun watch i dont take these movies seriously i enjoy them
Apr 6 2024,positive,the special  effects were awesome but the best part was that the  movie had an original storyline  and not just a rehash of an older version that  seems to be the norm in scripts  nowadays
Apr 6 2024,positive,action pack from beginning to end
Apr 6 2024,positive,fastpaced actionpacked good human characters great monster characters both heroic and villainous some entertaining humor gorgeous visuals and a fun story     i honestly wanted more its so good highly recommend to fans of kong and godzilla as well as families looking for a fun and enjoyable time at the movies
Apr 6 2024,positive,this is a good movie if youre only looking to see giant monsters clash among a barrage of special effects looking for anything beyond that like a deep story or multilayered plot will leave you feel disappointed you dont come into these kind of monsterverse films looking for anything complex its all about the spectacle and the action godzilla x kong gives you just that despite a few shortcomings that hold the movie back from being better than its predecessor but if youre there for the right reasons youll walk out satisfied
Apr 6 2024,positive,great great movie the ending is peak ligmaballs
Apr 6 2024,positive,i was totally captivated by the whole film the combination of kong and godzillas brute strength along with their clever maneuvers and acrobatics was simply awesome mothras grand return was a definite plus personally i found the movie to be phenomenal
Apr 6 2024,positive,totally a massive movie
Apr 6 2024,positive,a back to basics kaiju movie with more focus on the monsters especially kong
Apr 6 2024,positive,much better than what the trailer would make you think  all action no story makes for an entertaining afternoon
Apr 6 2024,positive,amazing and the most important about the movie humans dont care thanks for listening to the audience we dont want humans in the screen we wanted more about the titans and that is what they gave us
Apr 6 2024,positive,the movie was great it absolutely had me sitting at the edge of my seat cheering excited watching the fight scenes and how awesome both godzilla and kong looked trapper was definitely the best human in the movie and we need more of him and his cool gadgets in the next chapter
Apr 6 2024,positive,checkin your brain at the theater door and suspend your disbelief its an absolute slug fest that keeps you on the edge of your seat
Apr 6 2024,positive,more monster movies like this please
Apr 6 2024,positive,there are some common criticisms that i would like to address briefly because i really do feel like this movie has seen the most unfair amount of criticism of the narrative universe and godzilla 2014 was already being butchered incredibly unfairly     the lack of creativity in the world building is a very shallow and empty attack not only do we have a narrative filmsnovelscomics that is incredibly coherent and is following a clear path the consistency of both power scales and continuity is incredible all of this while still building on top   the liquids kong got injected after getting frostbitten are not explicitly made to heal frostbite they are probably akin to antibiotics often fitting for general purpose and combatting pains which is what even the actor says this should help against the pain   godzilla is more of a sidecharacter in this one but he is probably the most important monster of the movie a call for help from underground is guaranteed to be huge trouble reason for which godzilla immediately responds his characterization in the mv has been impeccable and this movie builds on top of the themes of isolation that this godzilla has gone through     some scenes that might explain the divide between the critics and the fans are actually the simpler ones   kong feeling pains because of the tooth  kong and suko enjoying a moment of rest and eating together  godzilla meeting mothra again  godzilla at the end of the movie resting in the colosseum     more mainstream oriented movie critics might not see any value in these but the fans do
Apr 6 2024,neutral,great technologybut not good story
Apr 6 2024,positive,i enjoyed  this wasnt expecting anything but some monster fun which it is exactly  what i got in spades i did laugh out occasionally but hey it isnt a serious film
Apr 6 2024,positive,godzilla x kong the new empire delivers a visually stunning monsterverse spectacle a deeper exploration of hollow earth an enigmatic subterranean realm inhabited by titans expands the monsterverse mythology for fans
Apr 6 2024,positive,less humans and more monsters this movie was awesome i loved it godzilla and kong kicked major azz forget what the critics say it wasnt made for them we want more the monsterverse can def surpass m she u
Apr 6 2024,positive,the pacing of the movie really ramps up in the middle leaving some parts feeling rushed and unexplained its redeemed by the clean cgi and motion its definitely a must see in 3d
Apr 6 2024,positive,the end surprise me but over all hoping to see more add ons
Apr 6 2024,positive,i was pleasantly surprised by how quickly this movie brought me into it and kept me swept up in the mythical action sequences that were paired with some great cinematography and acting i was really impressed with godzilla x kong and i felt that it was a thrilling and fun movie that fans of the titan monsters will appreciate the introduction of the mini kong was particularly cute and it reminded me of seeing diddy and donkey kong in action  as a tongueincheek comedic relief and element of surprise thrown into an otherwise compelling story that i thoroughly appreciated
Apr 6 2024,positive,its a step up from the last movie for sure however if youre a godzilla fan youll feel robbed specially given the tittle this is definitely a kong movie with godzilla making an appearance it is not a godzilla movie at all
Apr 6 2024,positive,not sure why the critics are hating this movie  its fun lots of fast paced action caring monster scenes and funny moments all wrapped in a good scifi monster flick
Apr 6 2024,positive,really stupid and really funny
Apr 6 2024,positive,i love how there 3 parts to the movie and they have their own mission not just boring humans or just over the top cgi this one have the perfect balance and a lot of action with a good story not sure what kind of drugs the critics was taking i enjoy the movie from start to finish and it was entertaining
Apr 6 2024,positive,the monster mash that we needed brings back classic showa action and just a fun ride all around
Apr 6 2024,positive,good actions and ending
Apr 6 2024,positive,love the movie and the consistent action and nonboring plot
Apr 6 2024,negative,very disappointed in godzilla x kong   the story was not good and fight scenes left much to desire  when you see godzilla minus 1 it makes you relieve just how bad godzilla x kong was 
Apr 6 2024,positive,loved godzilla and kong working together plus mothra helping out was icing on the cake
Apr 6 2024,positive,overall a solid popcorn flick kongs journey into the deeper hallow earth was engaging and the fights were very entertaining godzilla taking on titans like scylla and tiamat at different points throught the film were definitely highlights along with shimos introduction
Apr 6 2024,positive,this movie was good the kong x suko storyline was sweet and actually brought a tear to my eye i thought kong and gias relationship was good as well i loved all the action scenes in italthough i thought they were too cartoony and didnt have weight to them the human characters were a bit clunky but i got a laugh here and there mothra seemed a bit sidelined overall it was a great fun time but it felt a wee bit too goofy i love the tone of these movies but wish the action scenes had more weight i thought scylla and tiamats fight were too short and i wish they didnt get killed but enjoyable none the less
Apr 6 2024,positive,movie was very action packed i like how realistic the monsters were
Apr 6 2024,positive,absolutely stunning family movie action packed and great storyline 
Apr 6 2024,positive,such an awesome movie loved it and so did my family
Apr 6 2024,positive,for me if everything was just a bit longer or maybe directed a little better like for example with tiamat i think the fight shouldve been gone longer if everything wasnt so rushed then id give this a 5 star but for the good parts like the action for as long as they lasted they were good was an okay movie
Apr 6 2024,positive,good movie my wife and i enjoyed
Apr 6 2024,positive,one of the best movies in the monsterverse the story wasnt great but it was fine and had great action and special effects worth it to go see
Apr 6 2024,positive,i love the cgi effects and script
Apr 6 2024,negative,this is an awful movie the acting sucks the story line is so silly the entire movie is extremely cheesy the sequence of events and timing dont make sense save yourself two hours and nap instead oh did i mention the acting sucks fighting scenes are chaotic noisy and very unrealistic i felt like a 12 year old produced this film
Apr 6 2024,positive,this is what the world need to see a not perfect movie but their unrealistic way to be makes it a beautiful piece of art that the critics do not like their opinion dont count since the movie cuties
Apr 6 2024,negative,just an overall terrible movie bad cgi bad acting and ridiculous plot i liken this to pacific rim 2 im just gonna act like this movie never happened
Apr 6 2024,negative,its the worst movie i have ever seen 
Apr 6 2024,positive,good kong movie bad godzilla movie human characters were mostly engaging but i wouldve wished they took some of their screentime and given it to godzilla doing literally anything godzilla mostly just felt like a plot device to end the movie kong was the shining star of this movie this is probably the best kong focused story so far in the monsterverse scar king is a amazing villian with how hes depicted as a false king shimu was great too has a lot of potential if they are going to show up in later movies
Apr 6 2024,positive,a fun movie a must watch
Apr 6 2024,positive,i loved it good clean fun took the kiddos and they loved it  so refreshingly positive evil dies badly and good conquers all godzilla still my favorite never look at critics theyre wrong 99 audience usually gets it right
Apr 6 2024,negative,the script was so predictable the actors literally talked out the plot this was just a cgi showcase with no real story
Apr 6 2024,positive,very good with a lot of graphic
Apr 6 2024,positive,it was a 100100 i loved it
Apr 6 2024,positive,great action comic relief and story
Apr 6 2024,positive,honestly one of the most fun films ive seen in a long time the monsters fights were great kong storyline is great and just godzilla showing why he is the king of the monsters
Apr 6 2024,positive,my teenage sons liked funny their dislikes were it was too predictable
Apr 6 2024,negative,beyond bad the movies all over the place the anticipation all for nothing uncool fight scenes humans had no chemistry whatsoever the tinge of comedy was as bad as the oh so big and powerful bad guy 1 out of 10
Apr 6 2024,positive,best one of the monster verse 
Apr 6 2024,positive,i love this movie its awesome badass and entertaining im glad we saw more of the monsters instead of the boring humans
Apr 6 2024,positive,it was amazing an action packed funny and interesting movie loved how it has less people on the screen and focused more on the titans     absolutely would recommend if you love giants fighting and some good laughs
Apr 6 2024,negative,there was no story line it had great effects and lots of smashing but id suggest not wasting your time or money
Apr 6 2024,positive,i am a huge fan of godzilla movies and king kong movies this movie out did alllllllllll the other movies it was amazing
Apr 6 2024,positive,its so much better with good fight scenes with a battle of monsters titans for godzilla and kong franchise

Apr 6 2024,positive,this was more of a kong movie featuring godzilla but it was awesome fight scenes and cgi were great
Apr 6 2024,positive,i really liked it aloti loved all the action and i love how the main villian skar king was not as powerful as kong or godzilla but he was smart and more agile and acrobatic and i loved suko too he was just adorable and loved shimos design and i loved mothras return shes so beautiful this movie was fantastic imo

Apr 6 2024,positive,im a recent fan of the monsterverse and binged them all with my best friend they are easy films to follow with amazing affects and are very funny so i expected the same with g x k we excitedly ran to our local cinema to watch it and were blown away    the cgi was incredible despite having the lowest budget of any of these films for whatever reason i honestly forgot cgi could be good due to marvel constantly shoving bad effects down my throat    the human cast while still not great were much better than last time my only real complaint is that godzilla is once again shafted hard in this film despite his name being the first word in the title it isnt as bad as g vs k where he only appeared twice an hour apart from each other though    the battles were amazing and very well choreographed which made for a insane final act if you like fun movies id watch this with a friend
Apr 6 2024,positive,like all of it great story line
Apr 6 2024,positive,the movie is short but hey mothras back and skar kings dead

Apr 5 2024,positive,while it isnt godzilla minus one it is a throwback to the times godzilla was fighting every monster ever made  its basically a little corny but centers on kongs need for companionship  it is a good two hours of fun and i enjoyed it for what it was meant to be
Apr 5 2024,positive,i made the choice to ignore science explanations they tried to explain in the movie as its just a movie it was a lot of cgi and flipping of the camerafelt a little too much this movie was more geared towards kong godzilla seemed to only be there when he needed help wouldve liked to see more of godzilla i still enjoyed it

Apr 5 2024,negative,this movie literaly had no point the story escalated to quicklybasacly 1 minute the  charachters were just talking abt basacly nothing just to make the movie longer and than the other minute it was fighting with some random kaiju it wasnt even cool and dont even get me started on the physics the titans were literally jumping around like they dint wheigh thousands of tons like compare the 2014 and 2024 godzilla one was barelly moving to really show how massive and heavy the titans are and the other literally looked like it was from a cartoon or something at the end of the movie just like in gvk the monsters teamed up and deafeated the antagonist titans so unpredictable def dont recomend would of rather watched kung fu panda 4 tbh

Apr 5 2024,positive,im a huge fan of the godzilla and king kong movies since i was a kid this one just seem to lack something i was less than thrilled but im still glad to see a movie that i grew up on
Apr 5 2024,negative,an insult to the audiences intelligence
Apr 5 2024,positive,please can we do away with critics often out of touch and wouldnt know a good movie if it came up and slapped them in the face case in point this one  godzilla x kong harks back to the rompin stompin days of the gdaddy in his hey day different to minus one but no less entertaining its all about the monsters in this one but kong gives us the human take with being a kind soul to the apes who are subjugated to the will of a tyrant kind of like a 300ft putin if you will just prettier and more intelligent  as predictable as ever critics dont see the movie for what it is its not out to win awards its never going to win best screenplay its about well done action with the 2 best kaijus on the planet but of course the critics wont like it because they just have to drill down and find fault simply because they dont understand the source material and worse still do not understand the purpose of it clearly never watched wwe so completely oblivious to the wavelength this movie is on thankfully most of the audience get it  i really wish you get critics who understand what it is they are watching not coming off the back of barbie or oppenheimer and expecting something similar from godzilla x kong wingard is one of us a die hard g man who gets what we want and  is in tune with the fans  and i am so glad we the fans kicked dirt in the face of these so called critics and made the movie a resounding success so get lost critics and try and find yourselves a real job one where you are actually good at it and know what it is you are talking about
Apr 5 2024,positive,just what i wanted titans destroying everything 
Apr 5 2024,positive,it was a good film if your looking for nonstop action then this film is worth the watch if your looking for a storyline movie then this isnt the one overall really good film tbh
Apr 5 2024,positive,loved this love anything kong
Apr 5 2024,positive,t was amazing for people who wanted to have fun but if you wanted to look focus into character development or that you would probably not like so good movie made me laugh
Apr 5 2024,positive,action packed movie
Apr 5 2024,positive,such a good movie honestly the only bad point was the spinning scenes and thats just cause i get motion sickness highly recommend this film
Apr 5 2024,negative,so stupid so goofy some of the cg looks great some of it is absolutely dreadful i love adam wingard simon barret and dan stevens so if i get to get the guest part 2 because this movie is a smash hit then itll be worth it
Apr 5 2024,positive,the 3d could have been better in some spots
Apr 5 2024,positive,this movie won an oscar for best special effects this year so i decided to go see the movie  i have got to say this was the best godzilla and king kong movie i have ever watched  the special effects were amazing  i wish i could of seen it in 3d but the theater only played it after 10 pm  worth seeing  loved this movie
Apr 5 2024,positive,one of the best movies in a while amazing action they made kong hilarious  they make you feel for damn near ever creature they created and the story got to the point  great development without  it being overly  drawn out  1010
Apr 5 2024,positive,good fights good design good monsters kinda funny  bad character bad humans bad screen play

Apr 5 2024,positive,as usual critics are dumb this movie was a blast my brother and aunt and i all loved it
Apr 5 2024,positive,i love how there so many monster action i love it
Apr 5 2024,neutral,awful script bad plot boss is too easy   kind of childish teenage plot    graphic is above average
Apr 5 2024,positive,saw this in imax it was absolutely fantastic loved every second of it the big monster fights and the characterization of kong was amazing you really feel the emotions i only have 2 downsides i wish there was more godzilla in the film hes sprinkled in there but i wish there was more of that big lizard and of course the human story is not that compelling at all just a mess but i never go to a monsterverse movie expecting amazing human character and im okay with that godzilla suplexing kong was peak
Apr 5 2024,positive,while the story and characters arent anything noteworthy and a not so stunning soundtrack godzilla x kong serves as a kong focus story with godzilla occasionally making an appearance where it does succeed is what it sets out to be a fun crazy monster flick fantastic action scenes near flawless visual effects and many funny moments throughout it deserves to be seen on the biggest screen possible
Apr 5 2024,positive,freaking loved it this is the most monster action we have gotten from these movies godzilla x kong the new empire was my favorite installment yet
Apr 5 2024,positive,the movie good im fan of godzilla for 15 years now

Apr 5 2024,positive,the visuals of giant titan are really sick and the human character are really fun
Apr 5 2024,positive,pretty enjoyable flick story is a mess but you dont go to these movies for story really
Apr 5 2024,positive,the visual effects were absolutely amazing even if the story wasnt always
Apr 5 2024,positive,awesome movie i took my nephew saw it in dolby i used a gift card i got for my birthday
Apr 5 2024,negative,it was a mid movie with a frankly annoying human cast while the fight scenes were interesting they were uninspired there are a thousand movies like this most with more thought out story lines i believe the writers sat down drank until they couldnt stand up and then wrote the script id advise watching this movie at home and hopefully under the influence of some substance also the fact that this movie has a 92 audience score is a crime and shows how far our society has fallen the people on here should be ashamed theyve rated this higher than oppenheimer and return of the king
Apr 5 2024,positive,the fight scenes were pretty cool story line was pretty bad ending was odd i enjoyed the first one better
Apr 5 2024,positive,it was full of action and i loved the message from the movie this is a movie that anyone can see i loved the scenes and the actors in it
Apr 5 2024,positive,just an absolutely fantastic movie clean not too long great convincing actors electrifying cgi and sounds absolutely stunning all around on the edge of your seat have not seen a great movie like this in a long time i so appreciate the talent that went into this must see multiple times
Apr 5 2024,positive,did it go overboard sometimes absolutely but kongs storyline and tons of action made this super entertaining turn your brain off and have some fun
Apr 5 2024,positive,the movie was awesome felt like i was watching a movie from when i was growing up so much action likeable characters and storytelling without dialogue definitely recommend
Apr 5 2024,neutral,i wanted so badly to like this movie but some parts are just so so dumb it wasnt a bad movie i wasnt bored but the movie just expects you to turn your brain off the whole time the movie was like if looney tunes  wwe  antman and the wasp quantumania had a baby 
Apr 5 2024,positive,disliked that some guy was on my seat but then i got the courage to ask him he was on my seat then him and the girl moved but yet didnt have tickets
Apr 5 2024,positive,its exactly the monsterverse  movie i wanted them to make next  it ended exactly the way i wanted it to end  the titan fights were spectacular  what else do you want with your popcorn  if you prefer emotional resonance and character development and love interests go to a film festival
Apr 5 2024,positive,the film is visually perfect entertaining and tells an interesting story 
Apr 5 2024,negative,terrible acting horrible script the whole thing makes no sense dont waste your time and money
Apr 5 2024,positive,its honestly what i have been wanting from the monster verse for years happy they finally leaned into it
Apr 5 2024,neutral,wish i had more hands so i can give it 3 thumbs dwn dissapointed compared to the last 2
Apr 5 2024,positive,its amazing how despite kong being a giant ape that doesnt speak is able to express so many emotions throughout the movie and then the movie goes full 100 mph and just doesnt stop its like a rollercoaster that just keeps going up it only comes down when its time to finish and you are absolutely thrilled
Apr 5 2024,positive,nonstop action packed my son and i loved every minute of it
Apr 5 2024,positive,rotten tomato critics dont know how to rate so nevermind their ratings i believe the audience has spoken this is a fun adventure laying the smackdown monster movie modern day showa era godzilla movie
Apr 5 2024,positive,yo the two new monsters looked fire definitely recommend if your bored
Apr 5 2024,positive,epic screw the critics
Apr 5 2024,negative,honestly they took a scrip out dragon ball super sisers not really worth watch i world rather watch kun fu panda and godzilla is not really is enjoyable
Apr 5 2024,negative,lots of senseless fighting with the occasional storyline and more senseless gimmicks without any need for dialogues evergreen film for lower end asian markets in tier 2 and tier 3 locations where the language is less understood and the movie would run just for the poster     you could even change the film title to return to the empire switch a few scenes and it might still run to get the cash register ringing     really wonder it they had to travel to morocco or italy to film the desert scenes couldnt make out why godzilla enjoyed swimming from gibraltar to egypt thank goodness they didnt show if it was breaststroke or butterfly
Apr 5 2024,positive,best movie of the new godzilla series remember it is a monster movie and is not going to nominated for vest picture award but is fun with great special effects
Apr 4 2024,positive,i watched it twice both in 3d imax and cinemas 3d and all i can say that this movie is very awesome pure action and amazing monster fights this movie brings me back to the showa era wow
Apr 4 2024,positive,lol moved right along but very deja vu of most monster films needed a bit more originality
Apr 4 2024,positive,great movie definitely recommend it to my friends and family that are monsterverse fans
Apr 4 2024,positive,was great film need the next big monster threat space godzilla or destroyer
Apr 4 2024,positive,godzilla vs kong the new empire is an absolute triumph in the world of cinematic spectacle from the moment the screen lights up audiences are transported to a realm where titans clash and every moment is filled with heartpounding excitement    the films narrative is as gripping as it is engaging seamlessly weaving together moments of intense action with genuine emotional depth as the epic showdown between godzilla and kong unfolds viewers are taken on an unforgettable journey filled with unexpected twists and turns    the performances from the cast are nothing short of exceptional each actor brings their character to life with nuance and authenticity adding layers of complexity to an already captivating story whether its the stoic determination of godzilla or the fierce determination of kong every character feels fully realized and integral to the plot    but perhaps the true star of godzilla vs kong the new empire is the titular monsters themselves the cgirendered creatures are rendered with such lifelike detail that they feel like living breathing entities every roar every stomp and every devastating blow serves to remind audiences of the sheer power and majesty of these iconic beasts    in conclusion godzilla vs kong the new empire is a cinematic tour de force that delivers on every level its a film that not only satisfies the expectations of fans but also raises the bar for blockbuster entertainment whether youre a diehard monster movie aficionado or simply someone looking for a thrilling ride this film is an absolute mustsee
Apr 4 2024,negative,genuinely one of the most boring movies ive ever seen so unbelievably predictable all the way throughout and even the cgi was poor
Apr 4 2024,positive,hell yeah we need more titan fights
Apr 4 2024,positive,i think its worth it the entertainment value and the music 
Apr 4 2024,positive,loved this movie its funny me and my dad had a fun time definitely satisfied us the only complaint i have is not much godzilla
Apr 4 2024,positive,ridiculously awesome i was thoroughly entertained by godzilla x kong the new empire with its plentiful great giant monster fights i can see why some critics dont like it because its hard for film snobs like them that are searching for the best pictures of the year to enjoy a ridiculous popcorn entertainment flick about giant monsters the plot doesnt remotely make sense but it is a giant monster flick and it was a lot of fun
Apr 4 2024,positive,i would have liked a little more kaiju action scenes but overall it was a good movie
Apr 4 2024,positive,it was entertaining action packed and i liked the follow through storyline
Apr 4 2024,positive,loved the movie everything was great 
Apr 4 2024,positive,as if cockintomato critics are reliable these days this movie was what it was meant to be fun
Apr 4 2024,positive,i came into this was low expectations due to seeing godzilla minus one but this movie was above and beyond great the action was good the cgi was great and there was a solid story
Apr 4 2024,positive,what did you expect a movie with well thought out characters and plots its a monster movie meant to make you feel good it has a decent message and fun and visible monster fighting that make you feel like your in the action and spoiler warning my favorite girl mothra 810 not a masterpiece but for a godzilla movie excellent
Apr 4 2024,positive,saw in imax and it was great  good storyline  acting and directing  better than the last one by a long shot
Apr 4 2024,positive,exactly whats expected from a rock em sock em monster mash up godzillas kio ken level up was amazing to see and the big g was an over all menace as he should be   loved it epic a good fun time
Apr 4 2024,positive,no character development no real plot but great action and fun  you really have to see it in 3d
Apr 4 2024,positive,the godzilla movie for our inner child    lets get this out of the way first this isnt godzilla minus one its not meant to be  other than having the same named character its absolutely unrelated    this is the complete opposite end of the spectrum from minus one its pure rule of cool with kaiju     personal i would have loved something that was a little more deeper or complex but end of the day i wasnt disappointed in the slightest
Apr 4 2024,negative,it was a complete mess one might expect a lot from a godzilla movie where there are more monsters than humans but it went pretty wrong the only good thing i find is kongs plot which at least was the only entertaining and even fun thing in the entire film but everything else is bad godzillas plot if you can call it that was more of a cameo than a plot because the miserable guy was just sleeping all the timeskar king is decent as a villain a complete moron and wretch but he was stupid at several points shimo on the other hand too overhyped it was a fraud and not to mention the humans everything was garbage everything mothra is forgettable the cgi is a joke compared to gvk
Apr 4 2024,neutral,how to say if you only see the monsters they can be 2 m or 200 m it doesnt make any difference i cannot say why but the movie was nice but they lost the spirit i felt in the first 2 movies it was some series of scenes and finally king scar wasnt as scary as they annoounced him so it was fine but nothing special no comparison to godzilla 1 which touched me emotionally
Apr 4 2024,neutral,i cant believe i sat through the whole thing just godzilla and kong tearing up the planet lots introduced and left unexplained
Apr 4 2024,positive,true cinema is back everyone
Apr 4 2024,positive,non stop adventure with larger than life scenes
Apr 4 2024,positive,phenomenal  insane special effects must see in theaters  must see if you are a godzilla or kong fan
Apr 4 2024,positive,i was in awe of how expensive this movie looked in every frame  like most of the film is cgi that looks astounding yet it was on the lower end budgetwise when it comes to monsterverse movies     the giddy excitement of godzilla vs kong wasnt really here and the hollow earth stuff felt unoriginal the ending was cool with destruction and mayhem but just didnt connect the way i wanted it to definitely didnt hate it but it was just meh and fine overall im glad some people really enjoyed it and i hope they make more the focus on kong was cool  especially how little dialogue there was so bravo on that a little bit of effort obviously put in which i appreciate
Apr 4 2024,positive,well done good storyline action and godzilla
Apr 4 2024,positive,super fun watching kong and godzilla the action was good and entertaining the main story was alright the side stories and human characters are mediocre
Apr 4 2024,positive,it was better than i thought and ver well done
Apr 4 2024,negative,horrible plot that went everywhere and crazy smooth  cringey scenes with the vet guy and music   you would think something dangerous would happen when the vet went to get the arm but nothing and he came back happy  audience was introduced to new creatures all of a sudden  they tried to throw in fancy sci fi vocabs  92 approval from the audience is a joke
Apr 4 2024,positive,this was a great movie the human characters have been vastly improved the cinematography was great and of course there was a total big pile of monster action sequences though the pacing screentime and use of godzilla could have been better
Apr 4 2024,positive,very exciting love the plot and titan culture development
Apr 4 2024,positive,it was a little goofy but something about monsters fighting on the big screen is cool
Apr 4 2024,negative,yikes that was painful to watch
Apr 4 2024,positive,this movie is exactly what youd hope it would be fun exciting and funny more often than expected cgi is pretty good and overall a very enjoyable movie    would highly recommend
Apr 4 2024,positive,fifth chapter of the monsterverse by legendary pictures and warner bros this work continues the events narrated in godzilla vs kong expanding every element and directing its spectacular matrix towards a more childish and harmless lighter and less problematic approach the film favors a particular focus on the origins and events in addition to the expected final battles of the monsters especially kong in a humanized and empathetic portrait even to the detriment of others and of the relationships between the human characters this time compared to previous episodes the antagonists dont fascinate that much and godzilla remains a bit marginal in the story the aesthetics the noisy staging and the visual impact are notable also thanks to the excellent use of cgi and special visual effects and the care put into the screenplay thin approximate didactic is a little less so in short a film without many pretensions but still fun pleasant and captivating in itself rating in tenths 6  650
Apr 4 2024,positive,2 hours of monsters brawl and amazing cgi i never got bored just a fun movie to watch if you can watch on imax
Apr 4 2024,positive,this what a kaiju movie is all about the kaiju or titans as it called in this universe are the real star of monster movies and this movie delivers it perfectly a lot of epic monster fights but also i like how the movie portray some light titan drama this was the recipe of the old heisei godzilla films the focus is on the kaijus and the kaiju themselves have a little bit of drama adam wingard finally got the formula for the monsterverse this formula is the fans have been waiting for  the 2014 focuses on the soldiers pov the star themselves which is the titans are just a background characters the next movie kong is average kotm delivers some awesome fight but still rely too much on human drama the gvk has the balance of monster fight and human pov this movie really showcase the titans and not a lot of human which the fans has been craving for
Apr 4 2024,positive,the movie was a great part of the franchise and very stay in your seat kind of movie it was great that they work together and that kong has his place and godzilla stays on top of earth i think there will be another kong movie though it ties in really well with the monarch serious also
Apr 4 2024,negative,it was a mess of a story acting is poor and the end boss is a huge let down an end boss that would need the power of kong godzilla and mothra should be a titan like we have never seen before a humanity ending type boss that you should fear the end boss is not fearsome or scary at all there is no build up of story about this threat it is a very brief 30 seconds about the history of this boss he is smaller than kong its a joke
Apr 4 2024,neutral,hollywood godzilla  kong films just get weirder its the same as watching a michael bay movie like transformers if you are into that type of cartoonish action ridiculous plot and forgettable characters then just sit back relax and enjoy the ride do not try to understand why its all happening and how it happens it just does because well hollywood take your kids they will enjoy it if you are a godzilla fan then just keep in mind this is a kong movie and godzilla is a secondary character he just doesnt get enough screen time this films wont stop and i dont care i prefer this over many terrible drama and romantic films ive seen announced so if they are gonna keep making awful films make it kaiju films
Apr 4 2024,positive,love this full of kaiju action nonstop kaiju fights and funny human characters
Apr 4 2024,positive,i can say godzilla x kong the new empire is the most incredible godzilla movie ever fans of the monsterverse and people who like to see monsters fight would like this movie but still this movie is not better than its prequel and also not a good plot and story
Apr 4 2024,neutral,if youre in for monster carnage youll feed on this one itll be a delightful snack due to the candy presented throughout the near two hour runtime of the film but it will indeed be forgotten after the film is done   as a fan of classical kaiju films it is sweet but it dulls the mind as a lover of cinema the monsterverse franchise continues to embrace soulless scripts with characters that go nowhere in terms of development and leaves the audience with no one to care for the franchise embraces the wonkiness and spits on the elements that couldve made this franchise great starting with gareths grounded first film back in 2014 i leave no urge to see the next installment to the franchise though this does leave me craving for the need to make my own monster flick
Apr 4 2024,positive,its a movie that favors the fanbase and thats ok it doesnt pretend to be anything else it is action packed and it embrace the mystics that some stories of the franchise have been known for    if you are a so called professional critic and dont understand the different intentions that the franchise of both monsters have had over the years do not start comparing it to different adaptations of the characters you dont have to be a fan to understand that just use a little of common sense
Apr 4 2024,positive,lots of action from middle to end i think the background about monarch was confusing i believe monarch is a streaming series
Apr 4 2024,positive,1010 definitely a kong movie more than anything but ohhhh does godzilla makes a huge impact definitely worth watching
Apr 4 2024,positive,good in accion and cgi really good mostly of the movie is cgi but its also very interesting to see how much of the editing of the movie is actually great but some details of how the story is showing arent good
Apr 4 2024,positive,pure fun action and little comedy great time smash smash smash 
Apr 4 2024,positive,awesome action funny moments as well as heartfelt ones   cool original villains
Apr 4 2024,positive,giant monster movie with giant monsters actually being the stars
Apr 4 2024,positive,amazing movie i like this movie a lot
Apr 4 2024,positive,the movie was great although the title is misleading i expected to see godzilla and kong make out at the end of the movie
Apr 4 2024,positive,amazing level of action and and very good storyline
Apr 4 2024,positive,all that we could want from a movie like this very enjoyable very few talk and lots of action enough story and nice designs it is not going to change your life or the way you think but you will enjoy
Apr 4 2024,positive,the problem with the critics think that its not like minus one and that godzilla is not the protagonist but at least its a monster movie for the whole public
Apr 4 2024,negative,shallow story weak characters bad animation cutaways every 5 seconds ive never seen a movie paced like this one absolutely awful this beats mile 22 as the worst movie ive ever seen
Apr 4 2024,negative,this movie would have been actually fun if it were just 2 hours of the monsters fighting and rampaging through earth and hollow earth  they should have left out all of the human characters from the movie  instead we got so much needless boring and trite dialogue throughout the film that couldve been dedicated to more mayhem and better fights leading up to the final fight
Apr 4 2024,positive,they got a mini kong
Apr 4 2024,negative,miserablly loud this was the first time we actually had to leave a movie because it was so dangerously loud my apple watch kept giving me noise alerts storyline was not great but it was also hard to pay attention because we had to cover our ears before deciding this was not worth permanent hearing damage
Apr 4 2024,positive,got in a accident so i couldnt show up and i couldnt get a refund but will most likely try to see it again
Apr 4 2024,positive,its fun to watch funny scene and a lot of monsters fight if you watching movie for fun then watch it
Apr 4 2024,positive,amazing movie no words just amazing 
Apr 4 2024,positive,this is a great action packed movie  i would totally recommend seeing this in the theater  the story was good but it was a little rushed  the cgi was very good
Apr 4 2024,positive,loved the part when kong fought using an infant as a child
Apr 4 2024,negative,those characters  moth and other just bit over the topbut the world  reality done left the building
Apr 4 2024,negative,in a time where godzilla is everywhere to be found the story felt rushed and bloated gone are the stories of the egg of mothra and the legendary twins that brought her back to life  the kaiju battles were fun but sadly i feel legendary has dried up the well on what made their godzilla fun by making him too strong and boring with 3 screenwriter the movie felt like everyone had a different idea on what this movie needed and in the end we get a movie that left me thinking that the franchise has no directions going forward
Apr 4 2024,positive,this movie is a blast an outright fun with fantastic action sequences what i like most the movie is kong and his character arc throughout the whole film what i disliked most or little nitpick is that godzilla is mostly a side character but overall fun blockbuster film
Apr 4 2024,positive,mindless fun i was smiling the whole time
Apr 4 2024,positive,loved every minute of it
Apr 4 2024,positive,the best movie of the monsterverse 
Apr 4 2024,positive,massively awesome titan battles i didnt love that two lead up fights were brief and concluded off camera one with kong and one with godzilla but still this was the most entertaining installment of this film series some of the concepts mentioned were fun and interesting as well
Apr 4 2024,positive,this has been the first movie in years to actually make me sit up in my seat and lean forward  the focus was on the titanskaiju and there were plenty of scenes to bring out your fangirlboy
Apr 4 2024,negative,an insane focus on humans in these movies kills any momentum the story gets  the kong stuff was interesting until it cut away to boring human sections of the story or until we were forced to watch godzilla sleep through his own movie definitely worth a monster sized skip
Apr 4 2024,positive,amazing movie love the action and the monster fight very good popcorn movie
Apr 4 2024,positive,i had a great time watching this movie im gonna go watch it again tomorrow its the best godzilla kong movie so far i hope they continue the story
Apr 4 2024,negative,pointless didnt care about the monsters whatever it was they were fighting about or the people meh
Apr 4 2024,positive,it was one of the best monsterverse movies and kong was the heart of the movie
Apr 4 2024,positive,pure momentum even the lulls are building to something
Apr 4 2024,positive,great movie would definitely watch again
Apr 4 2024,negative,absolutely terrible just absolutely terrible
Apr 4 2024,positive,its entertaining but it needs a little more story a message the movie is action but it doesnt try to be anything more than that
Apr 3 2024,neutral,very action packed funny and entertaining
Apr 3 2024,positive,wasnt impressed special effects are very cartoonish the writing is very weak and sci fi story line is way too unrealistic save your money and watch godzilla minus one
Apr 3 2024,positive,i usually do not like movies like this but i took my grandson to see this movie because hes a big godzilla fan and i have to say that i really enjoyed this movie it was a great movie
Apr 3 2024,positive,super fun movie lots of good action between monsters with a hint of absurdity excellent soundtrack that panders to an 80s person like me dont really need to go in knowing everything just sit back and enjoy its not shakespeare its just a good clean 2 hours of fun
Apr 3 2024,positive,great movie a lot of action
Apr 3 2024,positive,this movie was entertaining from beginning to end it puts godzilla minus one to shame
Apr 3 2024,positive,f yeah f yeah this is such a fun rollercoaster of a movie they finally got it right and made the fight scenes more on par with the old school showa godzilla movies this will be the most fun you have in a theater this year i said it with my whole chest its more of a kong movie guest starring godzilla but its fine with me because the action is awesome and entertaining the human element like with all the monsterverse movies is ehhh but who cares right show me destruction and combos such a fun movie
Apr 3 2024,positive,i loved this movie so much reminds me of godzilla final wars but for godzilla and kong i was in it the entire time and loved the action and the parts with kong and suko mini kong i hate how people compare this with a movie like godzilla minus one as they are both amazing in their own respects
Apr 3 2024,positive,mindless fun for any monsterverse fan
Apr 3 2024,positive,very good movie i loved the action
Apr 3 2024,positive,loved it very awesome and cool for all ages
Apr 3 2024,positive,wonderful action from beginning to end  google tiamat so you wont be lost
Apr 3 2024,positive,gigantic beast smashing trope intertwined with aimless plot twists left me bewildered
Apr 3 2024,positive,the movie exceeded expectations given by others pure entertainment and good story telling its flaws were overshadowed by the joy of entertainment the movie produces
Apr 3 2024,positive,really funny and alot of fights
Apr 3 2024,positive,graphics are very nice overall superb masterpiece 
Apr 3 2024,positive,made for children adults should go to godzilla minus one
Apr 3 2024,positive,i absolutely love how much bashing the critics are giving this movie i cannot say who cares loud enough to them because this movie is a flipping masterpiece this was a movie made by fans for fans and holy cow did it pay off with one of the biggest openings in recent years this movie gave us what we the fans wanted it started fast and never slowed down this had my 4 year old son glued to the screen and that is hard to do i loved it as godzilla is one of my top 3 favorite move characters all time godzilla was a bit underused but that wont sway my 5 star rating this was kongs story and man did it rock hottle continues to shine as jia as her character grows and brings us mothra the g v k fight in film was great gman dropping a picture perfect monster size ddt of kong mothras entrance was perfect coming in playing mom and breaking them up the end fight is one for the ages especially the way it starts in hollow earth with kong riding godzilla skar on shimo and them just jumping at each other above on the surface it got even better with shimo being freed and freezing skar and kong slamming him down into pieces this movie was just bonkers and i amwas all here for it and we got doug
Apr 3 2024,neutral,as my son said it had too many people the parts with the monsters were okay the humans were clunky and all the indigenous people are silent
Apr 3 2024,positive,i asked for a monster fight and thats what i got its perfect
Apr 3 2024,positive,this was such a fun movie to watch whats not to like about monsters beating up on each other thats what we wanted to see and thats what we got and of course the humans are boring adam knows that we dont care about human characters they were only there to move along the plot  all and all godzilla x kong is a fun ride to watch on the biggest screen possible
Apr 3 2024,positive,godzilla a d1 linebacker and i want him on my fantasy team
Apr 3 2024,positive,movie was very appropriate for my 810 yr old grand children held their attention throughout the entire movie overall a fun time was had by all
Apr 3 2024,positive,i think this is an absolutely amazing movie  i mean sometimes it was a little bit kitschy but i think a lot of people liked these scenes and thought they are heartwarming  this movie was shorter then the other ones and it really felt shorter  there were much more fights and they were legendary  the one scene were all the four kaijus were jumping and looked each other in the eyes was such an amazing scene and would make a great poster and the humor was pretty good as well most of the jokes or funny scenes were on great timing like i said the fights were legendary  they are in every movie legendary but this time it felt more dangerous and i have to say loved seeing godzilla and kong work together  one thing is they could have done maybe more scenes by godzilla because it kind of felt like a movie of kong where godzilla just took part but i recommend this movie absolutely and as a person who loves action this is a must see
Apr 3 2024,positive,worth seeing on biggest screen available imax if you enjoy giant monster fights and dont care about story line or acting
Apr 3 2024,positive,great movie   definitely a mustsee  especially in the imax
Apr 3 2024,positive,fun and entertaining delivers the goods and more on the kaiju battles
Apr 3 2024,negative,the cgi is embarrassing and the story is nonexistent even if youre in the target audience there are better things out there sadly it seems the box office for this points to more of it being made
Apr 3 2024,positive,im a kong fan and yet again he doesnt fail me
Apr 3 2024,positive,i loved that the movie is action packed from start to finish   the fight scenes are incredible and makes you not want to take your eyes off the screen the only downside is that the story has no depth to it and some cgi scenes seemed rushed
Apr 3 2024,positive,amazing storyline great action
Apr 3 2024,positive,all the action you want the human story was entirely in service of the action and plot and they were all pretty decent and not annoying this movie delivered so glad i watched this i thought it was going to be trashmid at best and it was as such a fun time
Apr 3 2024,positive,silly funny and great
Apr 3 2024,positive,i thought that at the end of the monarch on apple tv the movie would have picked up from their using the cast of the tv show for at least a short period the movie was good on the most part it wasnt as good as godzilla minus one hollywood needs to learn from that movie it was worth paying to see it at the theater once but not worth to do it again maybe when it starts streaming i might watch it again i gave it a 3 out of 5 stars
Apr 3 2024,positive,awesome addition to the monsterverse story is told from the monsters point of view critics probably wont like it but fans will love it 
Apr 3 2024,positive,we loved it had our 5 year engaged the entire time
Apr 3 2024,negative,it got boring halfway through the movie a lot of action but very empty content and it was cringe and cliche
Apr 3 2024,positive,the plot seemed very generic i can see why the audience draw the action and cgi were great but thats the only thing going for it
Apr 3 2024,negative,this movie felt like when a little kid tries to explain a story to you with the way it never connects or makes sense its just bright lights colors loud noises and bad cgi that makes half of the visuals look like plastic neither the humans or the monsters have any meaning
Apr 3 2024,positive,a godzilla movie turned up to 11
Apr 3 2024,positive,i wanted to see kaijus fighting and this movie gave me the necessary 3
Apr 3 2024,positive,its actually pretty good         my last good kaiju movie was godzilla minus zero minus color and monarch is pretty good as well this time around its the new kong x godzilla the new empire what made the last 2 i mention are the human characters  their interactions with each other thatll make you invested in the story especially minus one with a very relatable protagonist this time around they switched it from being less human characters focus to just concentrating on the greater plot by using less dialogues and more of that straightforward story telling and more focus on the monsters having interactions this time around and we dont get a lot of that in the previous installments and thats why its a breath of fresh air just like the movies in the early 2000s more action focused that tells the direction of the narrative they switched the formula and it still works
Apr 3 2024,positive,if youre expecting a deep thought provoking film about a melancholic lonely primate fighting depression whilst facing an altruistic but pompous giant reptile this isnt the right movie    this is no oscar bait so once we drop the pretention godzilla x kong the new empite is a bombastic action flick about big ape punching big lizard and vice versa and its a visual spectable with 80s soundtrack adding to the entertainment    this is pure and mindless entertainment with some decent humour sprinkled in here and there
Apr 3 2024,positive,i think this is the best movie of godzilla out there  is has everything vfxbgm etc its outstanding  1010 movie
Apr 3 2024,positive,all i can say its fun to watch
Apr 3 2024,negative,i didnt expect for this movie to be the greatest but i definitely didnt expect it to be this disappointing   before i begin id like to first say that i know movies as such these arent about the storyline and more about action but the story didnt really flow either     the pace is too fast it felt like i was jumping around granted action movies are meant for their fast pacing but something was off about this one     the actingyikes    was it just me or did the monsters not seem big enough it didnt give me the wow factor     lastly i thought the cgi would be better by 2024 but i guess i was proven wrong
Apr 3 2024,positive,folks this is a movie above a giant gilled monster giant apes and a giant bug  so you should go into this movie looking to be entertained and not looking for all the flaws you can pick out in the movie  if youre not a person who can suspend their disbelief you should see something else      that said i really enjoyed the movie  first i think its important for movies like this to show scale meaning show how big the monsters actually are  this movie included enough scenes of the monsters next to buildings that you get a real sense of how big these monsters are if they were real  they also did a good job showing the size of hollow earth     second this movie didnt try to be something it wasnt  referring back to my opening statement this is a movie about giant monsters  this movie did a good job of staying true to that basic premise and didnt try to be more than that with over dramatic acting or by including a list celebrities    it seemed as if the producers embraced the monster movie genre and tried to provide good entertainment     lastly this movie did a good job of filling out the godzilla and kong stories  these recent movies are doing a good job of trying to fill in the story lines of all the various kaiju from the 60s movies  those 1960s movies feature a number of different monsters who should all be featured in the modern movies if studios are going to to continue to make godzilla and kong movies
Apr 3 2024,positive,best pop corn movie this year not high art just a fun ride
Apr 3 2024,positive,if you are a fan it delivers
Apr 3 2024,positive,i would recommend it
Apr 3 2024,positive,this movie was kinda mid for the first half and the animation was kinda goofy but it really sky rocketed at the end and godzilla jumps of a cliff what else do you need
Apr 3 2024,positive,seen it opening night and i really loved it alot of monster action and getting to see a classic monster come back made it awesome its a kong focused movie which is expected because when this movie was first announced it was said to be a son of kong movie but the moments when godzilla is in it he shines
Apr 3 2024,neutral,i love a kaiju movie watched godzilla for decades and even liked the 1976 kong but this giant cgi apes punch giant cgi reptiles and thats it may be im getting old but its the sheer amount of death and destruction of the towns levelled that leaves me cold rome cairo and latterly rio dj suffer the same fate as san francisco boston and hong kong 10s of 1000s of people will be killed by the monster fights and no one cares or even references it long periods of no dialogue as its just kaiju fighting kaiju and i find it hard to write sonewhat boring
Apr 3 2024,positive,what annoyed me is the segregated stories of both kong and godzilla the buildup took too long to get to where they needed each other only to provide the audience with a 10 minute battle i felt shortchanged in favor of a story    kong is the first titan seen however for some reason he appeared regular sized they couldve done better displaying his size versus other living creatures i didnt think he was kong until he came from hollow earth to address his infected tooth    kong finding other apes was probably bittersweet for him its something he wanted but also something that wasnt accepting the babyyoung ape was a nice touch kong using baby ape to beat the other apes was just wild lol the evolution of baby ape and kong was a good play out particularly in the end    am i the only one that the thought scar king was just some crackhead red clay ape his fight with kong was interesting im not completely sure how he even got the upper hand on kong considering the size difference between the two kong did rock his ass with that metal fist    godzilla has absolutely zero regard for humanity hes out here moving around and destroying shit and doesnt even give af that is wild to me i know the rebuild is astronomical and costly for the citizens paying taxes i definitely enjoyed the integration of other godzilla alliesfoes so seeing mothra was a nice touch however why cant kong and godzilla just communicate with each other someway that hey i need your help instead of ripping each other to shreds and using a mediator
Apr 3 2024,positive,a phenomenal experience and a film that monsterverse fans as well as anyone who loves incredible action rich scifi and heart need to check out the titans are clearly the main characters of this film they get more screen time then ever before and the action scenes are super clear and uninterrupted the films score keeps many elements from 2021s godzilla vs kong which i personally appreciated overall godzilla x kong will take you on a wild but awesome adventure
Apr 3 2024,positive,awesome movie kept me entertained throughout the whole movie
Apr 3 2024,negative,the movie just feels insulting for every moment of dumb fun there are ten moments of hollow emotion rushed pacing and some of the most baffling scriptwriting ive ever seen its a slap in the face to anyone who wanted mindless entertainment and instead got belittling contempt
Apr 3 2024,positive,it was pretty good  there was some lazy contrived writing but you dont really come to a godzilla and king kong movie for excellent writing do you  i liked it perhaps better than the previous godzilla vs kong movie primarily because it had a more consistent pace  i am not disappointed its a fun popcorn monster smashing time  if youre a real fanboy of the franchise you could complain about a dozen different things and still enjoy it
Apr 3 2024,positive,if you go into this movie expecting high quality writing and a great story you will be disappointed if you go in expecting a popcorn flick with awesome action and giant monsters trying to kill each other  youll have a great time
Apr 3 2024,positive,absolutely amazing my husband and i loved it
Apr 3 2024,positive,i loved the cheesy fun this was better than godzilla vs kong
Apr 3 2024,positive,honestly loved the whole story and introduction of old and new titans so happy that this was a good addition to the sequels unlike the last jurassic world movie lol
Apr 3 2024,negative,too modern not like the old king kong vs godzilla too many different animals
Apr 3 2024,positive,good movie so much fun cool action scenes good time
Apr 3 2024,positive,this is what you wanna watch if you want to entertain yourself the pure awesome and silliness of this movie is what makes it top teir reminder a movie doesnt have to have a underlying message to be entertaining it can just be huge monsters bashing each other
Apr 3 2024,positive,great movie fun and action packed theres a lot going on but in a good way however i do believe the movie should have been longer that way it may have slowed down the pacing so it didnt seem like so much at once in some places recommend seeing it on the big screen has a few humourous moments great cgi
Apr 3 2024,positive,exactly the type of movie you want to see on the big screen at the theatre  awesome action and we get to see minikong
Apr 3 2024,positive,godzilla and kong have been a part of my life forever love watching their evolution its a great time for all things godzilla minus one won an oscar this year this film does not disappoint hallow earth gives fans a great new adventure to explore loved this film
Apr 3 2024,positive,i loved it so much the monsters are all packed with so much personality and unique charm for each one lots of sick fight sequences and actually got a little emotional at the end 
Apr 3 2024,positive,fun movie overall even if it kind of fell apart into nonsense towards the end
Apr 3 2024,positive,really fun entertaining
Apr 3 2024,neutral,i think the first part of the movie is also enjoyable because it looks like a 90s style adventure movie but then in the second half it starts to bore you a little then the film has scenes with a somewhat fludging cgi human characters always remain characters that are not indepth and that you cant like one last criticism must be made of the title of the film that should only be called kong the new empire since godzilla has about 10 minutes of scenes during the film
Apr 3 2024,positive,ignore the criticswhat do they expect from a monster movie romeo and juliet drama  just go in the theatres and watch it godzilla rules
Apr 3 2024,positive,it was amazing it made me cry you have to go see it
Apr 3 2024,positive,very much enjoyed this action packed blockbuster
Apr 3 2024,positive,this movie was so much fun to watch this film was great because it didnt pretend to be something its not it isnt a deep film its a fun 100 percent action packed film this film was like watching your favorite toys fighting it out in a large screen it brings out the kid in you
Apr 3 2024,positive,you gotta love godzilla movies this one was fun
Apr 3 2024,positive,if you enjoyed showa era godzilla and godzilla vs kong then youll enjoy this movie too almost half of this movie is dedicated to kaiju time which is an increase over gvk the fights are over the top fun its nice that they were able to return some of the same cast members to retain continuity and the new cast were a good addition
Apr 3 2024,positive,just as a normal audience without judging this movie of its logic it is so so so so fantastic and worth watching it at theater i love this movie and definitely get thrilled with all the fighting scenes
Apr 3 2024,positive,great story great effects and amazing fight scenes
Apr 3 2024,positive,i have always been a huge godzilla fan and i thought this was a really good movie but nothing against kong i like kong but i will always prefer godzilla and there definitely could have been more of him one other thing the climax at the end mostly involved godzilla fightingoneshotting enemies while floating in the air where he is out of his element and that was actually slightly disappointing and very very brief godzilla looks way cooler when hes wrestling with titans on the ground but other than that the movie is very beautiful
Apr 3 2024,positive,a very enjoyable movie would highly recommend if you want a lot of action  and fights with the monsters the only thing that could have been better is the storyline and i feel the movie was a little rushed
Apr 3 2024,positive,fantastic cgi and it has everything you would expect a monster v monster movie to have
Apr 3 2024,positive,good action with few fun
Apr 3 2024,positive,amazing movie edge of my seat the whole time and fun humor throughout you will laugh be super entertained and gripping your seat from all the action
Apr 3 2024,positive,it is an excellent film the entire film keeps you looking at the screen there is good action there is good action incredible moments it is the best film since 2024 and it is highly recommended
Apr 3 2024,positive,it was awesome lots of action highly recommended it
Apr 3 2024,negative,nope this film has 7x the budget of godzilla 1 and has worse acting writing and vfx turn your brain off or watch dune or go outside
Apr 3 2024,positive,its more of a monster battle now then focusing on the main characters which is good expecting from a monster movie however the reason why the critics are not liking it because the connection is quite awful with everything explaining rushed to get into the monster battle
Apr 3 2024,neutral,thankfully the kaiju battles remain the franchises strong point but godzilla x kong the new empire marks a largely hollow and cartoonish entry in the monsterverse
Apr 3 2024,positive,loved every second of it
Apr 3 2024,positive,theres got to be the best movie in 2024 i love this movie so much
Apr 3 2024,positive,i liked the big monsters fighting
Apr 3 2024,positive,just watched this in the theater and was pleasantly surprised i was prepared for godzilla x kong to be a complete stinker its nowhere near as good as the first godzilla released in 2014 now that was a great movie     in godzilla x kong the action was nonstop and there was no shortage of creatures however the story was nonexistent and the colors too pastel for my taste    spoiler alert   compare and contrast unlike the first two installments  godzilla and godzilla king of the monsters  godzilla x kong lacks any chacter development series cannon or plot aside from the couple of random monarch bases theres no mention of monarch at all or anybody who works for them oh sure the main characters are with monarch but are they really why is there no tie in to the apple tv series which was great by the way why is there no mention to the serizawa family chen family shaw family or the randa family     the movie doesnt pull us into caring for a character as it has previously either were supposed to care for jia and dr andrews relationship but that falls flat art direction is average and so is mood tempo and lighting     overall the movie does what its supposed to do entertain its fun fastpaced full of large monsters and of course godzilla if youre looking for a dark wellwritten character driven movie then look elsewhere
Apr 3 2024,positive,godzilla meets kong in an action adventure for the year pretty fun but a stail villain that kind of threw me out of the film however i am excited to see where this goes next the human aspect was sort of dry but the monster action def made up for it
Apr 3 2024,positive,such a great movie amazing
Apr 3 2024,positive,great flick big fan of franchise it delivered
Apr 3 2024,positive,its a part where the fierce fighting scenes are extremely fun and exciting theyre all wellmade the sound of over 100 voices cant compete with those whove seen it with their own eyes
Apr 3 2024,positive,definitely would watch it again
Apr 3 2024,positive,was a really good movie but i was hoping for an end credit scene but solid movie
Apr 3 2024,negative,worst movie of the year 2024  waste of time and money wanted to walk out first 20 minutes
Apr 3 2024,positive,great addition to the monsterverse and even better that we get to see so much kong and godzilla loved that they brought back characters like jia and ilene really love that one of the main characters is deaf and we get to see sign language in an action movie definitely a must see in theaters
Apr 3 2024,positive,it was awesome had a blasts love watching godzilla and kong teaming up together and kicking   its a must see movie 
Apr 3 2024,positive,graphics were good story was ok
Apr 3 2024,positive,action packed godzilla and kong are the super team
Apr 3 2024,positive,a blast literally 
Apr 3 2024,positive,perfection hopefully another one happens love seeing these two work together
Apr 3 2024,positive,so nice i seent it twice
Apr 3 2024,neutral,what i didnt like about it was that it was overly loud and disorienting with the video cuts it seemed like it was directed by cody danny mcbride from tropic thunder what i liked about it was kid kong and king kongs evolving relationship
Apr 3 2024,negative,cant believe this movie is getting such high ratings it was a waste of the 17 i spent to see this the dialogue was awful and was one of the worst parts of the movie trapper was so painful to listen to  they were trying so hard to make him seem cool and hip and just made it so cringe would have been better without the human plot at all cgi was good though dont have any problems with that overall just disappointed i was scammed of my 17 for this cash grab of a movie
Apr 3 2024,positive,great movie  graphics and effects were fantabulous  even a good story line  definitely go see it
Apr 3 2024,positive,the movie was good the fighting was well done and i think how the story went was well done if any one is a fan i would go and see it
Apr 3 2024,positive,the dopest of the silliness of it all is so absolutely absurd the it actually works  awww nope but giant monsters in 3d is still dope af
Apr 3 2024,positive,a monster royal rumble of epic proportions check your brain at the door and just have fun this is nowhere near an oscar winner but the nonstop battles make the movie fantastic kong takes center stage and zuko makes a cute sidekick
Apr 3 2024,positive,it was so cool and amazing experience for all ages
Apr 3 2024,positive,finally a monster movie with fighting not crying not hugs and mom and daughter time monsters fighting i was relieved they didnt make godzilla and kong kiss or talk about their 2 dads cause we all need to be educated  this was a monster movie like you remember back in the day there were some far fetched scenes that either saved cgi money stretched the time or served a purpose that just didnt need to happen 3d or 4d experience maybe  however what you need to know is the audience actually clapped when it was over i have not been to a movie where people clapped at the end in years literallyyears please keep action godzilla movies rolling out and make us happy and make  how hard is that
Apr 3 2024,positive,although not as good as the first matchup and a bit overthetop at times its still a fun popcorn movie with lots of monster and ape action the humans are mostly irrelevant though and serve very little purpose the film culminates in a solid kaijutitan wrestling bear down
Apr 3 2024,positive,bloated cgi fest   godzilla and kong are huge creatures yet for most of this movie their scale is irrelevant except when theyre in cities   to see these titanic sized monsters bouncing around like acrobats or john wick is a bit ridiculous   minus one was a much better monster movie  with monster movies like this i think less is always morejaws and alien as examples    thankfully the human story wasnt as distracting as it has been in the past
Apr 3 2024,positive,dont listen to the critics awesome movie
Apr 3 2024,positive,better than i thought it would be very good fight scenes godzilla is definitely king mothra also surpassed me she helped godzilla understand kong needed his help
Apr 3 2024,positive,this movie was badass   i love it
Apr 3 2024,positive,my 1st viewing was in imax  i loved it 2nd viewing was in dolby and i loved it just the same
Apr 3 2024,positive,just as good as gvk amazing visuals as usual and loved kong and godzilla battling together once again a must see in theaters
Apr 3 2024,positive,godzilla x kong the new empire monster bashing to the max  negatives the editing and pacing was not great and i felt a little pissed with the ending the story isnt really great but its mainly there for monster bashing there wasnt really great human character growth   mixed the main villain of this film im a little mixed on the backstory of the villain is cool and i felt like its a huge threat but when hes on screen i dont feel as scared but his design and goal was good   positives there was 1 human character i enjoyed played by dan stevens he was funny and likeable guy the cgi still looks amazing and ive the visuals there was 1 huge surprise in this film i went yes i figure out how godzilla got pink and it makes sense there was more than plenty for fights and i had a great time i think there was 1 godzilla killing another monster that was awesome godzilla isnt on a the time but for what time hes on screen he kicks ass for me though kong is the star and he was my favorite character i wish it was just a pure kong film cause his story is great   to sum up godzilla x kong the new empire its not amazing story and characters not great editing but its a hell of a fun time its monster bashing and fighting to the max i had a great time with this film and i definitely watch it again on dvd i had a blast with this film and my monster lovers will like it i give godzilla x kong the new empire 355 funny time with a ton of monster fights
Apr 3 2024,positive,loved it great action story line looked so realistic  not too bad of language for even 10 year olds
Apr 3 2024,positive,i will admit it is not the best out of the monsterverse but it is not bad i love that they show a connection between kong and minikong they explore more of hallow earth and godzillas evolution and backstory but ya it isnt at its best the close up shots are repetitive and not always well as well as fights they could have been longer and the story is rushed i feel like this movie should have an extended version so that way the shots and cuts are not quick they can pace it better and it doesnt use so many corny moments to make up for it i think scar king is an interesting villain but wasnt given enough screen time nor build up to be effective but the other kongs and the ape army was interesting godzilla should have gotten more screen time since it seems he is always in the background but the transformation and ideas for him were something i like the one thing that is a flaw in this movie is the humans they are either introduced and killed or dont have a role to play i think that they need to be given more time in the film to get us interested in what they do like when they explore hallow earth on their own and learn and see things from their time together and not need to explain it to us but i feel like if they got the people who wrote monarch and make the next one they could use this as a stepping stone it isnt bad just not the best it could be
Apr 3 2024,positive,if you enjoy seeing very large monsters battle with occasional plotline interruptions then this movie is will be enjoyable
Apr 3 2024,positive,it was great idk what tomatometer means but i think it means the movie is good i rate it a 100 10 out of 10 must watch again cant wait for it to come out on max and hopefully theres plenty more movies to come
Apr 3 2024,positive,had low expectations but even tho a mini kong didt call my atention at first the storyline makes this movie lots of fun
Apr 3 2024,positive,i would have liked more character development or detail it feels more action with no connections still a great movie
Apr 3 2024,positive,godzilla x kong is a fine installment of the modern kaiju genre though it does require you see everything before it otherwise youll be a bit lost taken on its own it has plenty of action drama suspense  it really ups the stakes  shifts the dynamic of the franchise i cant wait to see whats next
Apr 3 2024,positive,i loved this movie i had a great time watching it  it was entertaining and fun hell with the critics i enjoyed it the best of 2024 so far  team kong baby
Apr 3 2024,positive,the best 4d3d experience of my life intense and an absolute thrill start to finish it was like being on a ride incredible work just wow
Apr 3 2024,positive,i loved the movie so much monster action and for some reason some people dont like it because there isnt much story but thats the point its just monsters fighting and its fun and whats wrong with that
Apr 3 2024,positive,this movie was sheer awesomeness its is my new favorite monster film id give it more stars if i could it delved deeper into the creatures we have come to love and digging into the weeds and getting to know the history of it all was the best part about the film not to mention the awesome fight scenes heres to hoping they make more of these films
Apr 3 2024,positive,i really enjoyed it lots of action and humor  definitely more of a kong movie but enough godzilla   to satisfy
Apr 3 2024,positive,the only gripes i have is why didnt godzilla have his classic score and i hate the made up creatures why not have some of godzilla classic toho foes godzilla was in it alot why are they saying he isnt  the action scenes was awesome i loved the human aspect in this especially dan stevens  scar king was cool it explains why godzilla is pink so stop freaking out people this is the best one out of the american monsterverse 82 10 it was great
Apr 3 2024,positive,this movie is wickedly epic
Apr 3 2024,positive,i really enjoyed the movie having kong show different emotions was a plus the overall storyline seem to flow pretty well until the middle of the movie where it seemed like it was about to be forced a little you really dont need to see the other movies too enjoy this one although it helps
Apr 3 2024,positive,huge monsters tiny plot  but still fun on the big screen
Apr 3 2024,positive,excellent special effects and epic fights
Apr 3 2024,positive,92 had a emotional tied to the film which i like i liked how they used godzilla and kong was absolutely perfect the villain tho was little lack luster but very enjoyed and funny actually with the tiny kong
Apr 3 2024,positive,story what story big monsta fajt yesss
Apr 3 2024,positive,as an older adult it was ok well done for what it is but the younger set is the targeted audience
Apr 3 2024,positive,its very good movie
Apr 3 2024,negative,it was campy  i think my grandchildren liked it very much  i found it silly
Apr 3 2024,positive,absolutely loved this movie by far my favorite out of all the films filled with monster action left and right great story between kong godzilla and the humans that it kept my interest keeping me involved with the story till the end and so much more surprises that came throughout the film highly looking forward to what they have in stock for us in the future keep it up
Apr 3 2024,positive,the best one yet maybe i hope destoroyah appears in the next one
Apr 2 2024,positive,i loved the action and the three different story lines all going at once the line with king kong godzilla and the one with the actors
Apr 2 2024,positive,great movie good cgi  awesome fights
Apr 2 2024,positive,love the journey cant wait for the next
Apr 2 2024,positive,this was a cool fun movie to watch pretty much everything i expected when it comes to titan fights kong was hilarious and badass in this movie but the human characters are just so pointless to me in this movie and the final fight seemed messy and was quite underwhelming
Apr 2 2024,positive,go see it in 3d amazing quality graphics and action scenes happy 70th birthday godzilla
Apr 2 2024,positive,if you like monsters attacking each other youll love this movie
Apr 2 2024,positive,a monsterverse film never disappoints me i mean godzillas new look is awesome kong aged but love the detail that went into kongs look shimo looks great and scar king is weak but cool so bright and colorful but action filled gxk is gonna be my favorite movie of all year
Apr 2 2024,positive,i personally really enjoyed this movie although the storyline was a tad messy it was extremely exciting and a thrilling watch would recommend and would 100 watch again
Apr 2 2024,positive,i really enjoyed this movie although i do wish we saw more of godzilla  other then that w movie
Apr 2 2024,positive,excellent film worth watching
Apr 2 2024,positive,awesome movie wish i  could go to hollow earth
Apr 2 2024,positive,this movie was an absoulte fever dream and probably one of the most entertaining movies ive ever watched
Apr 2 2024,negative,im a big godzilla fan and this movie unfortunately was one really lame and dumb movie experience it felt exactly watching a mind numbing michael bay transformers movie perfunctory dumb and silly cookie cutter characters whose only purpose is to explain what is going on giant plot holes and silly exposition action was like watching a transformers movie in all its overblown cgi glory  its a giant red ape with his ice breathing pokemon monster vs godzilla and kong great for the mindless mainstream movie masses but ill pass
Apr 2 2024,negative,the movie was well made but just plain dumb i felt dumb watching the movie the wife and i just wanted something to do so we went to the movies and that was about the only non r rated movie showing so we picked it big regret neither one of us liked the movie
Apr 2 2024,positive,i enjoyed the movie and that the titans character were more on display in this movie
Apr 2 2024,positive,pure power fantasy commands wide format viewing to get the most out of the picture
Apr 2 2024,positive,its a good movie 8310 this movie feels like a saturday morning cartoon episode which is a good thing this movie had heartdecent comedy and very intese fight scenes i loved how we saw more kajiuaction then all other movies frm the monster verse this movie is not for the critics and for serious movie people this movie was truly for the fans my only flaws i have with the movie was that scar king didnt really seemed like a big bad like they say he was and my other flaw is godzilla really felt like side piece but like  a wacky fun movie like this you wont get bothred by it
Apr 2 2024,negative,has a rushed plot and lazy writing a 10 year old could write a story more complex   the visuals were nice and but the damn the fights were so short and underwhelming all the fighting the trailers were pretty much it im not kidding
Apr 2 2024,positive,simple and raw entertainment it may seem childish but thats what gives it the magic
Apr 2 2024,positive,lotta action lottoe fun
Apr 2 2024,positive,nothing to dislike i loved it
Apr 2 2024,positive,it was a good movie good special effects at times a bit hard to follow but otherwise it was pretty good 
Apr 2 2024,positive,very loud big screen film lots of continuous action  the ending  lacked some clarity for us
Apr 2 2024,positive,i like the godzilla with matthew broderick and the kong movies in general this was good but not great within a minute of the film beginning kong was on screen in all his glory the movie was fast paced and of course lived and died by the great cgi and special effects story line was cute i deducted 1 star because the movie committed the ultimate sin in this genreif they couldnt figure a way out or wanted to flex some special effects muscle a random character would dump technical bullcrap as fast as possible for no reason  hes absorbing all of the radioactive material to keep the 2 pyramids from fusing and the gravity from releasing before the bad apes can reach the new portals to the surface that we didnt know aboutthats a lot of information in 10 seconds that didnt make sense with the rest of the movie but sure explained what was on the screen at that second solid flick with good effects good pace mediocre story line well spent afternoon
Apr 2 2024,positive,godzilla x kong  the new empire is a awesome monster movie a must see movie in the theater
Apr 2 2024,positive,plot makes 0 sense but we get to see the titans one after the other btw team titanus gojira all the way 
Apr 2 2024,positive,so that was amazing  dang mothra came back shimo appeared and dang i just saw it on march 31 and i want it on tv and prime video now
Apr 2 2024,positive,the story line was very good but typical the special effects were incredible
Apr 2 2024,positive,absolutely loved the movie they did a great job at not spoiling the movie with the trailer i cant wait to purchase it
Apr 2 2024,positive,best monsterverse movie yet if youre a fan of godzulla new and old this movie will not disappoint the return of a certain monster which i wont name was the icing on this monster melee cake loved the movie loved the monsters long live the kings
Apr 2 2024,negative,a cure for insomnia has been found  an absolutely terrible film where the storyline makes no sense  the human acting is worse than a childs nativity play one can only assume that the director was smoking something herbal when it came to the final cut so much hype and expectation yet only to feel like a child opening an empty box at christmas
Apr 2 2024,positive,have been a godzilla fan since i was a kid this movie was a ton of fun and was an excellent continuation of the evolution of godzilla as a monster and kong as a story driven character definitely lookin forward to seeing where they go with the franchise
Apr 2 2024,negative,movie was all over the place crazy entertaining at least
Apr 2 2024,positive,the human characters did not get in the way of the main attractions movie the titans were front and center
Apr 2 2024,positive,absolutely bomb godzila looked sick  cong looked masive compared to the other ones  shimo is nice mothra is back  scar king id shattered w
Apr 2 2024,positive,the storyline jus kinda came out of no where for me it really didnt follow to much of last movie
Apr 2 2024,positive,this movie was spectacular and had  amazing scenery  it was action packed and it was so believable as far as the plot and the characters wer were concerned  it was also funny in certain parts  i love the animation and the pace of the film  my husband and i really enjoyed this movie to the fullest  it was a great movie and it is appropriate for all members of the family
Apr 2 2024,positive,we really like the movie just be aware that the first 40 minutes or so has barely any human dialogue but the cgi and the monsters were pretty cool
Apr 2 2024,positive,fantastic actionspecial effects    very good monsterverse movie
Apr 2 2024,positive,loved it a nice blend of human and titan storytelling which i believe the other monsterverse films lacked i will definitely watch it again
Apr 2 2024,positive,the movie was excellent and kept me wanting more
Apr 2 2024,neutral,what made godzilla x kong somewhat enjoyable was how silly the dialogue was though i have to commend the soundtrack and gci
Apr 2 2024,positive,i watched this with my friends yes it might not be the best plot wise but it makes up for the badass fights and action
Apr 2 2024,positive,monstrous fun a few too many plot points that dont get explored thoroughly our big bad good a fair amount of screen time phew
Apr 2 2024,positive,this movie shows that you dont only need a good plot for a movie to be good sometimes you can just enjoy the wackiness and fun of a movie this movie perfectly shows that element
Apr 2 2024,neutral,look this is the dumbest and ridiculous and stupidest movie i have seen in a long time that has a shitty plot and dialogue but my god did i have some fun that fun is the monster fights between godzilla and kong and the other titans that appear in the film dan stevens is a lot of fun and looks like he is having a good ol time this could have worked as a pretty damn good follow up from godzilla vs kong but it doesnt really wanted to explore hollow earth and learn more about the mythology or hollow earth in a well written way and take out certain characters and also establish the threat of the creatures but they dont do that at all most of the movie is boring with some exciting and hilarious scenes but thats just 40 percent of the film but the rest is just dumb wish it could have been better
Apr 2 2024,positive,i enjoyed this for what it is but just dont expect oscar worthy dialogue or performances from actors since the stars are cg generated  story a bit hokey but we are talking about apes and lizards as tall as skyscrapers here
Apr 2 2024,positive,i have to think the best movie in this year is godzilla  kong the new empire
Apr 2 2024,positive,full of action liked it
Apr 2 2024,positive,this is a kong movie and i had to accept it throughout the movie but as the movie progresses you cant even hate kong the team up was awesome if you grew up to your parents buying you godzilla movies youll love the awesome fight scenes this movie offers please more movies
Apr 2 2024,negative,so stupid the actors are terrible and never had a chance to be good because of their awful writing
Apr 2 2024,positive,very good movie i went to see it with my family very good the scenes of the titans fighting were my favorites
Apr 2 2024,positive,fun popcorn blockbuster to be enjoyed with your brain turned off
Apr 2 2024,positive,action packed shenanigans only wish is that there was more
Apr 2 2024,positive,i love reading the critics reviews who expected something intellectual or deep out of a godzilla moviesmh its a monster movie you loserslots of actions battles and thats what the fans wanted we dont come for the story we come for the over the top action scenes and crazy monster fights if you want glorious battles this is your movie
Apr 2 2024,negative,okay so first of all if your looking for a giant monsters fighting each other with good cgi and vfx then this movie could give you the joy you want expecting more from this movie except action is like time waste  the story  the plot the charcter arc are very poor  even the main characters feels poor in this movie  i would say its just an giant monster movie without a story and character build up trash and and time pass movie wait for ott
Apr 2 2024,positive,awesome entertainment and story the director took some time with this movie and it shows with the entire production it gets lengthy in the beginning but its a must to stay patient overall its an add to any movie library with added movie watching numerous of times
Apr 2 2024,positive,flashy lights and boom boom monsters fighting they promised that and they delivered 1010
Apr 2 2024,positive,great king of monsters flick
Apr 2 2024,positive,loved everything about it big monsters fighting other big monsters
Apr 2 2024,positive,i saw it in the theatres reclining seats and laser ultra avx  fun movie but ordering on a little too goofy
Apr 2 2024,positive,this movie deserves better they finally came up with a new idea with the antagonists and the sounds for godzilla and kong are perfect as always the pink dorsal fins remind me of my favorite godzilla millenium and the design for shimo reminds me of an ankylosaurus but with long legs and its head looks like some dragon from one of those dungeon games
Apr 2 2024,positive,it is a great filmthe action in this movie is really great kong dominates the movie but i dont have problem with thatso the movie is great
Apr 2 2024,negative,unimaginably stupid and impossible to take seriously
Apr 2 2024,negative,mid asf just was not entertaining
Apr 2 2024,positive,i understand why the critic score is so low but as a fan i enjoyed every interaction and honestly i wasnt expecting much which made it even better when i heard the incredible sound design and visual all in all its fans movie for sure
Apr 2 2024,positive,me and my son really like it
Apr 2 2024,negative,a total waste of time    i walked out   save your money
Apr 2 2024,neutral,godzilla x kong is a very flawed film with lots of confusing and crammed storylines and characters but i will say it does manage to pull on of the best action films you may see this year it is so fun and a true turn your brain off movie that audiences of all ages can enjoy king kong is given a more likable storyline and godzilla is given a respective storyline while people may say id go see this again  i would not i truly dont like or understand the monsterverse and its likability i would recommend this film if you want a good time or to a casual audience but i wouldnt go crazy for it overall a fun time but ultimately forgettable
Apr 2 2024,positive,i saw this movie on imax 3d recently at fast let me start with the good things i found about godzilla x kong the new empire this movie has good and the best vfx and action i saw godzilla in many forms most likely blue thermonuclear and last pink thermonuclear forms was awesome and new character suko is very cute and kong adopted suko and mothras special appearance and was amazing and giving a great slap to godzilla and kong rides on godzilla giving goosebumps and all the fours are crashing talking about a human character like bunnys acting was very funny the new hero trappers last entry is so cool now let me say that i was as disappointed about godzilla x kong when was godzilla fighting with scylla for just 10 seconds and tiamat also just 20 or 33 seconds i thought it would be at least 1 minute btw i want to see this movie 1 more time thank you to adam wingard for thinking of such a great story
Apr 2 2024,positive,this film did exactly what i expected it to do thrill excite and entertain since this is a movie and i suspended disbelief when i sat down i couldnt less about what the critics have to say i never base my film choice on any critics review that said i didnt care much for the surfer dude vet too cheesy also i didnt think the scar king was that good of a concept as a villain for one thing he wasnt that much bigger than kong as they claimed i did like that kong has others like him and hell now be their leader all in all good movie
Apr 2 2024,positive,great movie that i enjoyed with my wife and kids nephews and brother great movie
Apr 2 2024,positive,amazing movie just fantastic  
Apr 2 2024,positive,i loved the action and the monsters  mothra was a surprise
Apr 2 2024,positive,the human roles dont clog up the screen time when this movie is all about the titans if it were a more serious tone movie itd be a different story but this movie is just an all around good exciting time
Apr 2 2024,positive,if youre looking for some epic popcorn fantastic epic cgi amped kaiju fun then you have come to the perfect film for that i had such an amazing and fun time watching this the little kid in me was jumping up and down from all these awesome kaiju battles this is exactly why you come to this movie not for the dialogue not for the deep impactful message and not for an artistic experience no you come for the wall to wall absolute crazy bonkers kaiju slugfests wwe brawls and epic fights hands down a guaranteed exhilarating time to be had by all with a pulse
Apr 2 2024,positive,i had high expectations but they were surpassed i loved it and would see it again
Apr 2 2024,positive,the story line was good  special effects were great
Apr 2 2024,positive,it was a really good movie it was worth every minute
Apr 2 2024,positive,this was a wonderful movie very well done only thing that i didnt really like about the movie is the title godzilla x kong where it was primarily a kong movie  i think godzilla should have had the finisher since his name is first in the title if you remember the last movie kong had the finisher and he finished the titan in both movies kong is a force to be reckoned with but remember godzilla is king of the monsters
Apr 2 2024,positive,brilliant shimo is actually a cutie patootie
Apr 2 2024,positive,typical monster movie  bad acting good monster cgi kong is too humanized bionic arm
Apr 2 2024,positive,12 year old and 9 year old loved the movie
Apr 2 2024,positive,my entire family loved the movie
Apr 2 2024,positive,what an absolute blast visuals are kick ss over the top fights are fun and refreshing humans in it are actually enjoyable to watch interact and kong with his little buddy steal the show and im for it all
Apr 2 2024,positive,i came for kong and godzilla action sequences i got that and more disappointed with the final fight with scar ans shimo but overall i had a blast watching it in theatres
Apr 2 2024,positive,it is such a good  movie its better than that bad fucking megamind vs the do do my ass
Apr 2 2024,positive,if you go into this movie expecting a deep storyline and intentional character development you will be disappointed  gxktne is an actionpacked fastpaced and wonderfully colorful film  the landscape reveals got to be a bit much between scenes that it took me out of the movie a bit  as fastpaced and actionpacked as this movie was the kaiju attacks were never spectacular  godzillas atomic burst and atomic breathe were pretty cool but aside from that the special attacks were pretty tame spoiler  my main gripe is the death of scar king  it took godzilla powering up kong getting the beastglove attached and mothra being summoned  before they were ready to fight  all of this buildup for the main battle only to last a few minutes and scar king just being frozen and pounded on by kongpretty underwhelming  all that being said i thoroughly enjoyed the movie and im happy with how it turned out  however it may be my least favorite of the legendary godzilla films
Apr 2 2024,positive,personally i enjoyed the movie ive been watching godzilla since childhood plot is decent cgi is good and lots of action pack kaijus fighting if youre into stuff like i mention this movie is for you
Apr 2 2024,positive,i as a long time godzilla fan approve of this film it was quite the spectacular adventure keeping me and all my friends on the edge of our seats through the whole film
Apr 2 2024,positive,the 3  d action was great really enjoyed it
Apr 2 2024,positive,1010 the subterranean hallow earth was really interesting and love that king has found his species and it not alone godzilla looked amazing he was cooking at the last battle
Apr 2 2024,negative,terrible writing annoying characters
Apr 2 2024,positive,awesome movieexciting and easy to follow action packed
Apr 2 2024,positive,story line was creative
Apr 2 2024,positive,a action packed movie not really alot of talking or details as some of its previous movies i would definitely see again i hope the saga continues because theres still a loop hole about some kinda project they were working on
Apr 2 2024,positive,just like godzilla vs kong the humans didnt really play a very big part in this film but the titan fights were awesome like always godzilla isnt in the movie as much but kong was the mvp of this whole entire film skar king was kind of badass not going to lie
Apr 2 2024,positive,dont get me wrong its a dumb movie plot wise and the humans are only there for exposition but god damn the monster stuff was on another level godzilla was badass in his little murderevolution bplot and kong reigned supreme with his scenes with the other apes the action was so bonkers i dont know anyone who cant have fun with this move
Apr 2 2024,positive,we absolutely  love it
Apr 2 2024,positive,the effects are good and the story not bad must see in big screen because the clash of the titans are just soooo fun to watch it is a good action movie and you will not regret it perfect addition to the monsterverse
Apr 2 2024,positive,anytime a critic hates a movie i know ill love it and this is true for this movie critics lost touch with how to have fun and enjoy a movie for what it is bunch of babies if you ask me go watch the movie it was fun kept me engaged and built up to fight
Apr 2 2024,positive,this movie was a blast i had sooo much fun watching this this is the type of movie that gives the fans exactly what they want to see that respects the target audience take note hollywood
Apr 2 2024,positive,just a fun time with great titans and awesome fights the story is not the best but that is not why we love these movies
Apr 2 2024,positive,extraordinary fight sequences enjoyed every bit kong x zilla 2v2 was lit
Apr 2 2024,negative,too much fighting between 4 monsters  you cant tell who is fighting who unrealistic  bad acting except the little girl
Apr 2 2024,positive,pretty good movie enjoyed it a lot the action was really exciting same for the monsters some of the characters did need more development but otherwise got nothing to complain about
Apr 2 2024,positive,this movie was great  godzilla minus one was great but it has absolutely nothing to do with the film other than a monster having the name godzilla  you cannot compare the two lest youre a moron  this was more my speed  id put this on in the background over and over like gvsk  minus one you have read every bit of dialogue to truly enjoy and its just too weighty for a kaiju film  we used to have to have either a serious g film or a silly g film  now we live in a time when we can have both and both be great for very different reasons  its a very good time to be a g fan
Apr 2 2024,positive,this was the most fun i have had watching a movie in the cinema in recent times the fighting was amazing and better than previous films the only bad past which drags the film down is the human sub plot which was corny and had convenient plot points however this doesnt drag the film down much due to the action being that good i would watch this film again
Apr 2 2024,positive,this movies cinematography is incredible amazing   story line  titans fight is also good and villain is very scary and more powerful than kong but godzilla help the kong and fight with simo and scar king  final fight is also incredible  i really suggest all of you 
Apr 2 2024,positive,graphics are great action scenes from start to finish couldnt keep my eyes off the screen
Apr 2 2024,positive,saw this in 4d and it was awsome 
Apr 2 2024,positive,its really nice even though it is cartoonish its still fun to watch recommended indeed
Apr 2 2024,positive,i freaking enjoyed this film so much i loved kong godzilla and the action scenes this movie is everything i ever wanted as a kid and i finally got it after watching this movie 1010 imo
Apr 2 2024,positive,every part was amazing
Apr 2 2024,positive,after a number of movies in the series it feels like they have the formula right the fight scenes are numerous and epic and gory the plot is basic but is as a result much less convoluted than in some of the earlier entries and the fact that they concentrate on a much smaller number of human characters means that you feel that they get more focus to allow the story to breathe its exactly what you want to see from a movie like this
Apr 2 2024,positive,action packed favorite kongzilla movie to date
Apr 2 2024,positive,283 times better than barbie  pocket sand optimus primal 1010
Apr 2 2024,positive,very good movie loved the fight scenes
Apr 2 2024,positive,it is a film from which you do not expect a brilliant script you are going to see huge monsters fight and that is what they give you the action is not lacking and there is not a dull moment in the film
Apr 2 2024,positive,awesome great movie with a lot of titans the effects and everything was spectacular loved the movie
Apr 2 2024,positive,reallty great love the monster fights and the human story
Apr 2 2024,positive,crazy movie  i loved it  action  suspencion drama science fiction etc beats dune 2 by far
Apr 2 2024,positive,this movie deserves a oscar one of the best movies i seen in a while give this movie a 10 out of 10 one of the best movies of my life
Apr 2 2024,positive,im not a huge fan of this sort of movie but i found myself enjoying the fun of it giant monsters fighting
Apr 2 2024,positive,for me this movie was absolutely fun and also spectacular i had a huge blast watching it with my friends in the theaters and i suggest other people to give it a try if theyre looking for great monster fights
Apr 2 2024,positive,this movie was so rad lfg
Apr 2 2024,positive,honestly as a long time godzilla fan i loved the movie my only complaints are that i wished this franchise delved into more was monarch itself it feels like in all these movies theres a struggle to fit humans into the mix a government organization tasked with keeping giant monsters at bay should be much more entertaining to watch and has alot of room for creativity and yet they just constantly feel like spectators or abrupt conveniences to progress the plot or explain something i also wish they kept the original roar for mothra it was much more fitting and maybe highlight her bioluminescent godrays in combat more frequently it seems the queen of the monsters is frequently treated like an after thought and doesnt live up to her name in combat while it is true that in most of the films shes featured in she is killed or sacrifices herself godzilla is the king because of his overwhelming power what has mothra really done to earn her name when fighting alone but overall great cgi great action didnt really like any of the human characters but thats something i expected  storyline was wonky but i loved it nonetheless
Apr 2 2024,negative,big monster ooga booga boom pow nuclear boom kong misunderstood sad boy very sad godzilla punch punch power
Apr 2 2024,positive,there is a bizarre art to doing a stupid monster movie this well its all a cgifest of course and the choice to have almost everything in the journeytothecenteroftheearth zone is weird why put the big monsters in a setting where everything looks big but also who cares once we got to the scene where king kong uses a baby kong as a bludgeoning weapon to beat up other kongs i was 1000 committed
Apr 2 2024,negative,if you are looking for simple corny plot with comic book script and plot lines and unexplained science tech years beyond our current tech you might like this
Apr 2 2024,positive,perfect just perfect fighting

Apr 2 2024,positive,could have showed more of scarking hour into the film and hes still not seen reminded me of 2nd venom movie with carnage
Apr 2 2024,positive,where do i even start this movie was all around amazing from the monster scenes to the human scenes definitely the best monster verse movie yet and movie of the year it delivered on so much with the action scenes and getting to see the daily life of kong and how him and suko became closer like father and son and also showed how he doesnt back down from a fight and godzillas evolving through out the movie beating the other monsters and then seeing mothra again was amazing and scar king was kinda of a good villain but i feel like he was kinda weak and shimo was amazing too we need to see her again 1010 movie for sure adam wingard should direct again and the next movie should be kong suko and shimo together
Apr 2 2024,neutral,the monster fights were sickthats it
Apr 2 2024,positive,this film shows how we can have a all kaiju movie with no humans just monsters thats not to say the humans were bad trapper was a 1110 burnie was a 1010 and jia was a very good character and so was rebecca i dont know the characters name every thing fits to me nothing feels forced the monster scenes were awesome and the thing that was best of all in the entire movie                                                             was the guest appearance of doug
Apr 2 2024,positive,i liked the movie for the most part it just did not get to the action till so close to the end
Apr 2 2024,positive,bad cgi and the horrible unique and different girl who was the key to everything horrible but the rest of the movie is good i cant wait to see godzilla minus two
Apr 2 2024,positive,it was a good movie just feels like it took a while for the main battle between the monsters which was a amazing scene it just took to long and was to short
Apr 2 2024,positive,lots of action from the very beginning amazing cinematography both on surface but especially in hollow earth lots of surprises which lead to a fantastic ending definitely a must see for godzilla and kong fans

Apr 2 2024,positive,monster extravaganza  brilliant  fun engaging story  spectacular scenes and scenery  i can only speak for imax 3d magnificent  godzilla is on the move  lets go
Apr 2 2024,positive,it was fun it reminds me of older movies where it was an entertaining movie but not deep hints of nostalgia and just cool moments i wanted more godzilla moments and less of some of the people loved trapper and jia getting some good moments in the movie
Apr 2 2024,positive,the monsterverse  is fire 
Apr 2 2024,positive,was a very good follow up to the previous films seeing the first ever 6 way kaiju fight on scene with up to date cgi was a very interesting experience altho the climax didnt hit like godzilla  kong vs mecca godzilla it was still a really fun and great fight scene highly recommend to fans of the series
Apr 2 2024,positive,this movie is full of action and cinematic imagination i recommend this movie for the casual early summer monster action blockbuster the ultimate godzilla andor kong fan monsteraction movie and its filled with humor
Apr 2 2024,negative,rushed empty and even silly at points none of the story pieces feel well thought out or developed just random explanations its definitely a monster movie but thats it
Apr 2 2024,positive,almost nonstop action some humor great effects fast paced took my 11 year old daughter to see and she enjoyed it too
Apr 2 2024,positive,a ridiculous spectacle thatll guarantee to entertain not just godzilla fans
Apr 2 2024,positive,i loved the action movie was amazing hate the human parts but the movie was amazing itself 
Apr 2 2024,positive,what a fun movie to watch  i enjoyed every second of it the fights were lit
Apr 2 2024,positive,who doesnt like giant monsters kick the living hell out of each other
Apr 2 2024,positive,it crossed my expectations   love it  want to visit cinema again to watch it 
Apr 2 2024,positive,had best experience in theatre surely gonna watch it again 
Apr 2 2024,positive,really had fun watching this one its action pack and loaded with monster fights everything a godzilla movie should be i am a huge godzilla fan and what a great time to be a fan really looking forward to the next one
Apr 2 2024,positive,excitement watching the look on my grandson and his friend face was priceless we enjoyed the movie
Apr 2 2024,positive,if you want a fun kaiju movie that doesnt take itself too seriously and has great fights this film might be for you the story and characters arent deep but its fun to watch and root for the giants who cant be controlled by us mere humans
Apr 2 2024,positive,it squarely delivers on its name and what one would expect from a monster bashing movie
Apr 2 2024,positive,as usual critics are moronic just do what we do normally ignore them they are irrelevant this movie is very fun its much a kong driven storyline this is the type of movie you go see 2x in the theaters
Apr 2 2024,positive,i loved the movie especially in the theatre it may not do justice to watch it in tv i will suggest if you are into monster verse then please go watch it   it is avatar  tag team fight  queenmoth  2 minute silence for brazillians 
Apr 2 2024,positive,entering but a bit hokey as to be expected
Apr 2 2024,positive,this movie was one of the best movies this year and i definitely recommend watching it and i would love to watch it again
Apr 1 2024,negative,it had a few dull moments that made the movie stagnant your interest i actually fell asleep i never do that for example the background story they tried to introduce to connect godzilla and king kong is cheesy to me the only thing that carried the movie was the fight scenes
Apr 1 2024,positive,this movie was exactly what i wanted it to be  what i like about this monsterverse is that it doesnt take itself seriously  they want these movies to be fun and they delivered here  i really like the synth wave vibe and color scheme  i got to turn my brain off and enjoy some monster mayhem
Apr 1 2024,positive,movie had great pacing with equal monsters and just the right human content they kept the story simple and easy to follow
Apr 1 2024,positive,this movie was awesome yeah the middle gets a little muddy and the human story isnt the best but both titans steal the show and the action is amazing both kong  godzilla are done justice
Apr 1 2024,positive,i enjoyed it i was fully entertained its a bit bloated and silly but what do you expect not as good as king of the monsters but a worthy competitor it was mostly a kong movie with the occasional godzilla moment the human characters were neither likable or annoying they just kept the story going alone fine a proper popcorn film to switch your brain off and enjoy the spectacle thats all
Apr 1 2024,negative,worst of the franchise  humans were only in the movie to explain the plot devices that were somewhat unnecessary anyway  godzilla was so overpowered that there was no suspense  the fight scenes were meh  the nods to the showa movies fell flat  a suplex is funny from a guy in a rubber suit not so much from a cgi construct  overall this movie had no heart  more like pacific rim uprising or a terrible transformers  was expecting much better especially after watching the monarch series  wingard just ruined the series for me
Apr 1 2024,positive,i saw the movie in 3d 4dx and it was amazing there are a lot of fighting scenes which kept the movie interesting the movie plot did not change or drag on scenes the audience and i were clapping laughing holding on to dear life with the entire 3d 4dx movie experience
Apr 1 2024,positive,i saw godzilla vs kong the new empire on monday i enjoyed the special effects a lot
Apr 1 2024,positive,kong sweep  godzilla fodder  this movie prepares you for gojo vs sukuna in ways you could not imagine  kong sweep
Apr 1 2024,positive,this movie is exactly what you think it is giant monsters fighting with an attempt to sprinkle in some human elements cheesy at times but who cares its giant monsters in all their glory if you want a film that stirs your emotions watch minus one if you just want to have fun watch godzilla x kong
Apr 1 2024,positive,this movie brings the grandeur and charm of the shōwa era with a modern twist what amazes me about this movie is that the monsters alone are emotionally investing and easy to comprehend in the extended scenes they are in without any need for dialogue you can see what they think and feel in their various expressions and actions went in with a massive smile and left with it truly a must see for all kaiju and monster lovers out there
Apr 1 2024,positive,the movie was excelent
Apr 1 2024,positive,had trouble believing the bad guy was still alive after being trapped in the fire world  and what happened on skull island  like the action and sound track
Apr 1 2024,positive,this movie is amazing the story i thought was great the characters are funny even if i thought one of them was gonna turn into the villain multiple characters come back it looks gorgeous i dont care if godzilla shouldnt be pink since its a girl color i think its magnificent or magentacent kong gets the infinity gauntlet fair warning bright lights and flashing lights so if you dont want to have a stroke or be blinded by the sun then dont watch in conclusion monster fighting is good d
Apr 1 2024,positive,big dumb fun i freakin love a good ole godzilla power up also i just found it fun watching kong hang out and explore lol end fight is what you expect slightly anticlimactic compared to the last one but lots of fun nonetheless      i will say going back and looking at the first godzilla there is a sense of earnestness and horror in the original one that is completely gone now it felt really scary in the first one but now the titans are just walking around and sleeping in the colosseum like nothing
Apr 1 2024,positive,godzilla x kong  the new empire is an amazing experince you can get on imax and of course it did not dissopiont with all the  monster battles intense action and   a furter exploration into the hollow earth and everyone should get tickets to see on the biggest screen possible solid 810
Apr 1 2024,positive,this movie was exactly what i wanted it to be is it winning any oscars nope but there is so much fun to be had if you like the kaiju genre and incredible visual effects right at 2 hours it also doesnt overstay its welcome
Apr 1 2024,positive,loved that there were more kaiju scenes than human the battles were awesome
Apr 1 2024,positive,with each film the cgi and monsters get bigger and bigger i think the story just needs to be more complex
Apr 1 2024,positive,the best one yet a good balance between scenes with humans and scenes with the titans the structure of the movie is much better than any of the previous movies in this monster universe
Apr 1 2024,positive,easily one of the funnest entries of the monster verse action packed funny good storytelling and good enough acting from the characters the animations in this film were phenomenal really hoping this movie blows up at the box office so we get more entries of the monster verse im wanting another solo godzilla movie
Apr 1 2024,positive,get ready to be blown away by the most epic battles and breathtaking visuals of colossal titans that will leave you on the edge of your seat
Apr 1 2024,positive,this movie was enjoyable from beginning to end
Apr 1 2024,positive,this is the kind of movie that when we watch it we expect incredible fights and it fulfills its role and delivers that to us the story is weak but in return it gives us epic and thrilling battles
Apr 1 2024,positive,great movie  lots of action lots of titan screen time
Apr 1 2024,positive,solid edition to the series holds up well very entertaining
Apr 1 2024,positive,it was a great movie
Apr 1 2024,positive,graphics were good but the story was rough it could have been a great monster movie without the human stories that were poorly written and stereotypical  wierd podcaster crazy aussie motherdaughter angst  there was a whole story with just kongs quest for his kind and godzillas quest to stay king of the monsters
Apr 1 2024,positive,what i expected for a godziflla movie good special effects
Apr 1 2024,negative,typical boring cheezy wack overkill shame on the true godzilla fans  this was a big disappointment
Apr 1 2024,positive,i absolutely loved it it has a lot of monster action character in depth especially for kong the moments between kong and suko were adorable and great  action was great definitely the best monsterverse film to date i definitely recommend it
Apr 1 2024,positive,i went in with very low expectations to make matters worse i brought a date that was not into kaiju monster films we had a blast the movie recognized itself and carried an 80s action film vibe    my only criticism which involves spoilers is the last fight did not feel complete i assumed after years or centuries of imprisonment that the ice lizard dude would go bonkers and on an evil rampage     would definitely add this movie to my collection no regrets 
Apr 1 2024,negative,that movie was excrutiatingly bad plus i knew this was gonna happen
Apr 1 2024,positive,disregard any snobbery over this film yes this isnt godzilla minus one but it doesnt try to be its a colourful surprisingly funny and engaging film kong is the mvp here with the skar king even more sinister than the trailers suggest     shimo is a tad underutilised unfortunately and i think could have done with a tad more time in the spotlight but otherwise well worth the watch for fun  that thing critics forget about movies can just be fun  and godzilla x kong was just that
Apr 1 2024,positive,an amazing new experience captivated by plenty of monster scenes and action sequences the first movie in a long time that i wanna see twice
Apr 1 2024,positive,loved every minute  great buddy movie xxx
Apr 1 2024,positive,the movie is turn off your brain fun  its a monster movie stop trying to make it make sense and enjoy the spectacle
Apr 1 2024,positive,loved every minute of it i loved godzilla since i was little
Apr 1 2024,neutral,everything everywhere all at once monster movie style  this iteration steers away from the suspense of ifwhen the monsters will appear to savedestroy the world and focuses more on monster character development which no one cares about  3040 seconds a scene before jumping acrossthrough the planet exceptionally upclose and repetitive battle scenes lose the point of having a monster movie  we could barely see rio get decimated over all the closeup shots of eyeballs and roars  a weak plot a weaker villain weak writing and quite a bit too much of a good thing was not a good thing
Apr 1 2024,positive,probably the best movie in the franchise recommended to anyone who likes these type of movies
Apr 1 2024,positive,love letter to the showa era looked like the snk godzilla king of monsters smash em up game for a minute humans werent annoying this round crowd applauded at the end
Apr 1 2024,positive,the movie was great from the beginning to the end action packed and visually stunning  cant wait for more to come
Apr 1 2024,positive,good movie  fun to watch
Apr 1 2024,positive,i personally loved this movie the human aspect wasnt too much the fights were awesome it was funny and the jokes werent forced overall just a fun movie to watch with friends and or family im probably going to go  back to watcha  3rd time
Apr 1 2024,positive,action packed loved the movie it was everything unexpected
Apr 1 2024,positive,the plot is contrived and the movie is very slow for the first hour but it is worth waiting for the latter half of the film probably the best 40 minutes of godzilla battles ever made  youll laugh youll cry and you will cheer
Apr 1 2024,positive,not a lot in the script department but damn it if watching giant monsters beat each other outweighs any possible script the humans as always are just gnats in the waybesides for the little girl i like her the titans are awesome
Apr 1 2024,positive,i had a great time i love how all the characters felt like they had depth and the whole found family aspect if certain characters they did an amazing job making the monsters expressive even tho of corse they cant really speak and thats hard to do this movie is a breath of fresh air compared to most of the drivel shoved out these days theres a few things i was wondering about but for the most part this movie did its job amazingly definitely would recommend everyone see it and this is from someone who doesnt see a lot of movies cuz most are trash these days over all a great movie that ill be seeing again
Apr 1 2024,positive,i like it a lot it was good
Apr 1 2024,positive,great movie with lots of fun action worth a watch and hope we get to see more from this universe
Apr 1 2024,positive,great action picture  and audio quality was great  the plot was a bit contrived  no spoilers but even sci fi stuff can go beyond remotely believable vs coincedental   rpx sound was impressive  may even rival own at home
Apr 1 2024,positive,i absolutely loved the movie it is one of my favorite monsterverse movies the graphics are so awesome and the plot is so cool i went too imax 3d and it was awesome if you are going to watch the movie definitely watch it in 3d a couple things i would say about the movie is that the final fight was very fast there was a lot of trailers for this movie and a lot of things was said in those trailers if you are making so many trailers then make the movie longer besides that this movies was amazing
Apr 1 2024,positive,fun time at the movies
Apr 1 2024,positive,loved it such a fun movie
Apr 1 2024,positive,simply incredible if what you are looking for is a movie about kaijus hitting each other this is definitely your movie after all it is what characterizes this universe and enough to be entertaining
Apr 1 2024,positive,this is better than gvk
Apr 1 2024,positive,lots of monster fights exactly what i want out of these movies i couldnt care less about the human storyline
Apr 1 2024,negative,nope not even gonna bother seeing it im out gz minus one was sooo good i cant even watch this garbage
Apr 1 2024,positive,the film was an absolute blast
Apr 1 2024,positive,a very fun action packed movie the human scenes are alright but everything else is a must see good cinema watch
Apr 1 2024,positive,this movie is awesome it has excellent and exciting action badass godzilla moments good music good human characters and great cgi
Apr 1 2024,positive,finally a movie where the titans are the starts yes is not g1 but it never was gonna be that the human where there enough to explain the plot without been the main focus the final battle could have been longer still way to awesome
Apr 1 2024,positive,my grandsons and i loved the movie  we loved all of the action scenes and the 3d effects  i liked the subtle reference to the planet of the apes
Apr 1 2024,positive,awesome fight scenes and awesome kaijus kong having lots of personality along with other monsters are fabulous you dont need to hear them speak but see their body language and emotions godzilla is a badass as always skar king is a cruel and sinister villain that reminds me of kona from planet of the apes shimo is now on my top 10 favorite kaiju she is beautiful and enormous
Apr 1 2024,positive,after rewatching it this film is packed with visual monster scenes that are awesome
Apr 1 2024,positive,love the action and the character development of kong
Apr 1 2024,positive,lots of action i enjoyed it
Apr 1 2024,positive,it was ok bid dumb action with very little plot and sub plots that lead nowhere the dentist was pointless as were the other humans the cgi was good but it jumped the shark with scar king doing ninja moves kong with a power glove and godzilla doing wwe duplex moves crazy how the franchise started with a grounded and gritty take and ended up with a colorful humor comedy
Apr 1 2024,positive,monsters visuals sound fights action all you want to see from an action movie forget humans
Apr 1 2024,positive,if youre a godzilla or kaiju fan then this is the movie for you exciting brawls and great monster development and i really love the showa era vibes reminds of my childhood of me throwing on an old vhs like godzilla vs megalon
Apr 1 2024,positive,my 12 year old nephews loved this movie they said it was the best movie ever i enjoyed it also great visual effects the plot moved along at a good pace it held my interest i paid  90 for tickets and snacks going to the movies is a treat it was worth it we left happy and pumped
Apr 1 2024,positive,visuals were excellent story was to the point and most importantly it focused on the monsters
Apr 1 2024,positive,an amazing giant kaiju movie full of action a little bit of comedy to make the movie pass faster the only problem with the film being the slow pace at the beginning and the fact that godzilla supposed evolution being unnecessary it didnt make him stronger just better visually
Apr 1 2024,positive,its really cool to see kong  godzilla work together since from godzilla vs kong film and godzilla versus kong movie was good but godzilla x kong the new empire got me more hyped for every fight scenes ever
Apr 1 2024,negative,this movie was just terrible  the story if you can call it that was really bad they spent way too much time in hallow earth i couldnt find a way to care about the characters this  movie was so bad that it made gamera vs guiron look like a masterpiece  and granted yes i was spoiled by godzilla minus one which was amazing but even if i wasnt so spoiled there is no excuse for this movie to be this bad  godzilla x kong was more hallow than hallow earth
Apr 1 2024,positive,most fun ive had watching a movie in a while
Apr 1 2024,positive,like the film from start to finish a lot of action the whole time liked that the titans were more on film this time   most see
Apr 1 2024,positive,as an old school king kong and godzilla fan im slowly warming up to the new canon lore this one did so much to make it easier to accept and like fun from start to finish just like the old toho movies kids should love it anyway because of all the monster fights no particular moments stand out but over all it was a blast
Apr 1 2024,positive,its just incredible very fun to watch
Apr 1 2024,positive,good fun and entertaining would definitely watch again
Apr 1 2024,positive,epic blockbuster must see on the big screen
Apr 1 2024,positive,it was nice to see the same actorsactresses  kongs little animations were great
Apr 1 2024,positive,lots of action great story line cool effects
Apr 1 2024,positive,b on my scale  ill probably watch it one more time at home    the problem with the new movies is they feel smaller  we got back home and watches glimpses of the first reboot from 2014 everything feels more dramatic more emotional more real and godzilla is massive  now the new ones feel like theyre small animals running around like toys    thats not to say the cgi isnt great but its not as convincing as the first one is  even the cities feel less real than the first reboot
Apr 1 2024,positive,the new godzillakong movie was like if you asked a 10 year old whats the coolest monster smashem up stuff you can come up with it would be this movie and i mean that in the best possible way lol completely over the top nothing but sugar no nutritional value whatsoever and i was completely on board with it a good time at the movies see it on the biggest loudest screen possible
Apr 1 2024,positive,even my little 9 yr old daughter who hates these kind of movies said it was the best movie ever that sums it up
Apr 1 2024,positive,great movie lots of action only thing is the ending was a bit rushed they could have done a better ending but nonetheless my son and i enjoyed it must watch
Apr 1 2024,positive,refreshing human cast all the human characters had good chemistry all the fights were cool as hell what more can you ask for
Apr 1 2024,positive,this movie  is one of the best of this year so far and give us the audience all the we asking for and all that we want to see so we dont care about the criticsall matters is money and fans happy thea rest is bullshit
Apr 1 2024,positive,this was a blast i saw it in 3d and i would highly recommend to anyone looking for a fun adventurous movie the action is spot on and the story is awesome once you uncover who skar king is
Apr 1 2024,positive,loved the action and the way you could tell what the monsters were thinking even though there were no words spoken
Apr 1 2024,positive,it  is a fun entertaining movie   exactly what you would expect for a godzilla  kong movie  no heavy plot   i enjoyed it
Apr 1 2024,positive,the movie was awesome the seats need to be replaced
Apr 1 2024,positive,after the serious movie that was godzilla minus one we now get a godzilla movie that doesnt take itself too seriously which is a fantastic choice this movie was absolutely amazing     the monster fights were amazing the visuals were downright perfect the human characters were pretty fun and didnt detract from the spectacle     the monsters also take the spotlight in this movie with a lot of screentime dedicated to them the humans get a more backseat role which is great because i watch these movies to see monsters fight each other    kongs story in this movie is also great and is a highlight the emotion behind him was amazing too see     godzilla has less screentime then i would have liked but he still had enough to further his development
Apr 1 2024,positive,we enjoyed the movie
Apr 1 2024,negative,bloody stupid i havent seen the last couple in this franchise so maybe it would make more sense if you had but you really have to switch your brain off to enjoy this last battle was a bit more fun sorry rio but i couldnt suspend my disbelief enough to enjoy it
Apr 1 2024,positive,dont think about it theres power fists and freeze rays and the story is what your 5 year old would come up with
Apr 1 2024,positive,action pack and full with titancentred fighting scenes
Apr 1 2024,positive,really fun visuals and godzilla is just cool
Apr 1 2024,negative,this movie is completely a kong movie so if you are a godzilla fan then you will be disappointed
Apr 1 2024,negative,godzilla x kong   1     save your money   its like planet of the apes meets pokémon koba x charizard vs mechakong x godzilla on roids     the one star is for jia played by kaylee hottle and mothra and also for the asl
Apr 1 2024,negative,poorly written lazily plotted and just bland someone please let the director go make the documentary about chimps which is clearly all hes interested in and given the monsterverse to someone who wants it
Apr 1 2024,positive,godzilla x kong the new empire has found a great formula for actionpacked kaiju films letting the titans carry the emotional weight allows for the viewer to spend more time seeing the characters they really came here for while also threading a serviceable story kong is the main character of this movie and it was an excellent choice i understand and agree that we might not have had as much godzilla as we wanted but kongs arc justifies his majority share of the movies runtime all the supporting cast of titans were handled so well too mothra skar king shimo suko and tiamat are all a joy to watch in their different roles the hollow earth is a very intriguing environment that id love to see explored even more in a sequel it sets up the opportunity for many more stories around the great apes or the iwi tribes just like godzilla vs kong there are tons of great homages and easter eggs honoring the legacy of these kaiju none of the human characters were annoying to me but jia is still the only one who i want to see more of as a character trapper gets a shoutout as second best though ill end on the absolute best part of the film the fights are plentiful and exhilarating a variety of environments and a variety of kaiju make for the biggest spectacle of brawls we could have ever imagined
Apr 1 2024,negative,this review may have spoilers  one word  horrible  it seemed as if they tried to throw together multiple plots and try to make it work  nothing worked  this was a king kong movie with godzilla cameos  godzilla just slept in romes colosseum the majority of the movie as soon as the credits started to roll i looked at my wife and said that was dumb  one of the things that stands out the most is the mixing of the movie  in almost all godzilla movies the sound gets very quiet and he will roar to the point it vibrates the theater  you could not hear him roar at all because there was music playing or sound effects something  this movie was just abysmal
Apr 1 2024,positive,the movie for the most part was very good this movie was about kong and godzilla continued truce above and below territory this movie is 2 hours long i think the human elements were cut in the editing room to show more of kong and godzilla dynamic the 3rd movie could be very emotional and entertaining as it would be the end of this first trilogy of kong and godzilla arc i give this movie a 7510 dont come to much for the human element but for godzilla and kong
Apr 1 2024,positive,seeing monsters fighting gave me satisfaction once again i really loved this movie once again im going for the audience and not for the opinions of the critics
Apr 1 2024,positive,was an enjoyable to watch film i like how it mainly focuses on godzilla and kong and less humans which was well needed i loved the cgi effects
Apr 1 2024,positive,all that you want to see in a monsters movie very good vfx awesome battles and great monster gigants
Apr 1 2024,positive,awesome movie not sure why we need human interaction in monster verse movieswe need that action between kaijus not human showing up in betweenthat is deliverawesome directioni saw godzilla 2014 i was disappointed as when the kaiju was about to fight they show humans in between it was distractingbut this movie and the prior movie both of them are top notch action between kaijus awesome 
Apr 1 2024,positive,the titans fight was so epic and it have more titans screen time the human part was not to bored the movie was so peak
Apr 1 2024,positive,this was a fun film  dont go into this looking for a think piece  its action packed and my family and i loved seeing kong on screen we love this franchise and it gets better with every kong entry

Apr 1 2024,positive,for me its already the top 2 best film of the year the feeling cannot be written or described the best thing to do is go to the cinema and watch this masterpiece you felt the energy godzilla vs kong was very good but this is a whole other level cgi action scenes the titans the hollow earth environment all impeccable thats what agent likes giant monsters from the hollow earth and giant monsters getting beat up   for me its the best movie in this incredible universe godzilla x kong the new empire 9610 
Apr 1 2024,positive,great for all ages and surprisingly funny  also had surprisingly great music
Apr 1 2024,positive,a recipe with key ingredients
Apr 1 2024,positive,i can say with all the words that this is the best monstervese movie action from start to finish monsters everywhere new titans dougs appearance was incredible in the opening scenes this is a monster movie warner made bonito in this one the fight scenes were epic even more so the final in rio de janeiro cgi was perfect they made reference to gow 2018 it was incredible to see this with kong and suko on the adventure through the hollow earth encountering challenges along the way and defeating enemies the scene with kong beating the gorillas and using suko as a club were very good  the upp that kong is godzilla received were very epic godzilla became more agile and faster kong received the bionic glove seriously i had never seen a bionic glove as strong and durable as this one kong with this weapon knocking out godzilla and taking him by the tail even the portal was hilarious one of the best scenes even the humans were good in this film and there were more titan scenes than human scenes it was a monster fight practically from beginning to end every scene was beautiful and many references too my overall rating 9610 
Apr 1 2024,positive,top action for kaiju fight was pretty amazing just forget about human story let yall enjoy kaiju fight recommend for watching with family and homies

Apr 1 2024,negative,fyithis movie isnt goodbadits badbad  its really that awful    a real review    warning this movie is only good for 16 yrs and younger if you have a iq over 105 you will hate this with a passion read all the reviews the good reviews look so fake the negative reviews seem spot on with detail    only a stubborn cinifile can get behind this horrible awful mess of a film      just a moronic fyi  godzilla is a olympic marathon runner now god and kong apparently speak the same language now godzilla has better coordination than michael jordan in this flick godzilla may as well be doing contract negotiations for the chicago bears new stadium hes that human now and that complex and smart    first thing adam wingard should not be allowed to direct movies too much adhd and horrible mess of a script he shouldnt have been allowed to be in same room as the minus one director    this flick has so many fake positive reviews its beyond laughable    im reading these positive reviews on kong these reviews are laughably fake i know this because half the comments dont even line up with the actual movie so many fake reviews on this one     i actually saw it  its a complete incoherrant mess no sound mind could possible think this is a coherrant movie    yes theirs tons of smackdowns but who cares theres no character development like none    how do you enjoy a smackdown if you dont know the characters thats called adhd screen writing    this flick is adhd mess    godzilla minus one is a far superior flick  go see that its better than most 2024 best pictures
Apr 1 2024,positive,way better than i expected going into this   great movie for just a fun watch and who doesnt love monsters   really good story as well  i was intrigued with the lost civilization focus and of course the action was just great
Apr 1 2024,positive,went in thinking this might be a somewhat silly movie but i really enjoyed it from beginning to end loved 95 of the cgi was drawn into the storyline walked out saying i really liked that movie
Apr 1 2024,positive,this movie is very entertainment the fights between kaiju its on another level the trama isnt the best but the scenes action makes up for it one hundred percent recommended
Apr 1 2024,positive,i came into this movie with low expectations but wow it brought a decent plot action emotions and of course some corn but its impossible to make a perfect movie we also get a massive battle that has never been anything like that since destroy all monsters i recommend for all ages and required for all godzilla fans
Apr 1 2024,positive,i didnt think it was going to be as good as it was from the commercials but it turned out well  i was pleased to see mothra after soooooooooo many years and so many godzilla movies being absent
Apr 1 2024,positive,i was impressed with the kong he carried the movie the movie was action packed godzilla could been more scenes with him

Apr 1 2024,positive,much better than the previous outing it is what it is if you are expecting something other then you will be disappointed giant monsters fighting giant monsters that is what you get and i was pleased with the results
Apr 1 2024,negative,a theatrical masterpiece on roaring and having very little plot
Apr 1 2024,positive,great movie wish it was little a bit  longer
Apr 1 2024,positive,ill tell you whatthis movie was action packedfull of little easter eggswell written loved the cgireally beautiful movie only gripe i had was i wanted the boss fight to be longer but overall the lead up and sequences were all peak definitely a must see
Apr 1 2024,negative,i wish hollywood would go watch godzilla minus one to see how a great character driven story with outstanding writing make an outstanding movie the movie was boring moved slow the music seems like they were trying to be james gunn made no sense in this movie
Apr 1 2024,positive,it did what it said on the tin smashed lots of things up with lots of action to keep you entertained
Apr 1 2024,negative,heres my nonspoiler recap of the movie items are not necessarily in order of events in the move   kong goes to the dentist   kong ragdolls mini kong    kong becomes a kidnapper   kong makes sushi   kong eats sushi   godzilla makes sushi   godzilla doesnt eat sushi   godzilla charges his batteries   mini kong has stockholm syndrome   guy gets vacuumed by a tree    cinderella appears   girl learns geometry   vw ad
Apr 1 2024,positive,i didnt get enough godzilla  and kong was just bored
Apr 1 2024,negative,the movie was more about kong than godzilla  the last fight took too long way too long
Apr 1 2024,positive,godzilla x kong the new empire delivers an exhilarating clash of the titans that earns a solid 45 out of five stars while the movie certainly impresses with its epic battles and stunning visual effects theres a lingering feeling that it could have reached even greater heights critics may have their say but dont let rotten tomatoes scores sway your decision this film is a testament to why you shouldnt judge a movie solely by its ratings what truly sets this film apart is its intricate exploration of the origins of these iconic titans from the depths of the ocean to the heart of skull island the narrative is richly detailed providing fans with a deeper understanding of the mythical creatures theyve come to love overall godzilla x kong the new empire offers a thrilling cinematic experience that fans of the franchise will undoubtedly enjoy while theres room for improvement its a recommendation for anyone seeking a dose of actionpacked entertainment
Apr 1 2024,positive,awesome adventure through hollow earth and complete showa era insanity human plot is only there to give exposition dialog but nothing that affects the enjoyment of the movie
Apr 1 2024,positive,1010 will watch it again
Apr 1 2024,positive,great movie lots of monster akicking action i wish the battle with scar king was a little longer but this movie is a must see
Apr 1 2024,positive,exceptional best one yet for action cinema photography special effects the soundtrack was so appropriate and was just the cherry on top of the movie thoroughly enjoyed was way better than expected
Apr 1 2024,positive,all i have to say is this movie is for godzilla kong fans all i can say is this when it comes to movies judge for yourself never ever listen to reviews and critics rotten tomatoes  youtube there is only one reviewer you should listen to that is your self and your opinion on movies now that important message is out of way  i loved movie it clears up some unanswered questions that godzilla vs kong movie does not answer why godzilla attacks kong in movies when they meet if you like fan of kong and godzilla movies especially goofy godzilla japan movies where godzilla does drop kick jumping dance  use his atomic breath to fly away and ugly useless baby godzilla this movie is for you exactly what fans always was looking in giant monsters movies such as this show more monsters godzilla and kong less annoying boring unlikable humans from japan and american movies which people only watch these movies are fights and giant titans same can be said about transformers movies falls in to same category    your long time godzilla kong fan go see it you will not be disappointed only human i like this movie is still deaf girl who talks to kong  dont treat and compare this movie to godzilla minus one before godzilla minus one i never cared for humans in any godzilla movies and shin godzilla was long and boring with humans thats another reason i can add to list not like shin godzilla is long boring uninteresting human parts
Apr 1 2024,positive,took my two daughters for easter and also ones birthday and we all loved it i exactly the kind of movie worth seeing in theaters on a huge screen
Apr 1 2024,negative,terrible movie made godzilla lose the fight way too much against kong wont be watching another movie again if something like this happens to goji whole family and most my friends love goji but this movie left them saddened
Apr 1 2024,positive,new and old monsters compelling plot and satisfying ending what more could any kong or godzilla fan want
Apr 1 2024,positive,i loved the movie great action great humor and i was thoroughly entertained kongs interaction with diddy kong little ape was awesome im most likely gonna go see it again next weekend
Apr 1 2024,neutral,godzilla x kong the new empire throws humanitys favourite giant monster brawl back into the ring but this titanic tussle feels more like a tired rehash than a worthy successor we open with the uneasy alliance between godzilla and kong tasked with protecting humanity from lurking threats however whispers of a hidden danger soon tear this fragile peace apart dragging our ape and atomic lizard into a clash for survival    the films biggest strength lies in its breathtaking visuals the battles between godzilla and kong are undeniably impressive director adam wingard stages these showdowns with a chaotic energy taking us from the neondrenched streets of hong kong to the gravitydefying caverns of hollow earth the special effects are topnotch with both titans rendered in stunning detail godzillas atomic blasts illuminate the screen while kong swings through the air with a balletic grace that belies his immense size    unfortunately the impressive visuals cant mask the films narrative shortcomings the plot feels cobbled together relying on tired tropes and predictable twists the human characters once again relegated to monster movie peanut gallery duty are given little to work with theres a valiant effort to establish a connection between kong and a newfound ape companion in hollow earth but its underdeveloped and ultimately inconsequential meanwhile bland dialogue and clichéd motivations make it hard to care about their fate    the pacing is another culprit the film lurches between slow expositionheavy stretches and frenetic action sequences the editing feels choppy at times leaving some fight choreography confusing and hard to follow the score by tom holkenborg junkie xl is a mixed bag while it boasts some pulsepounding tracks during the fights it lacks the thematic depth or memorable motifs that truly elevate a monster movie    godzilla x kong the new kong empire feels like a missed opportunity it evokes memories of classic monster brawls but fails to capture the spirit of what made them special while kaiju fans might find some enjoyment in the bigbudget slugfests the film ultimately disappoints with its forgettable story underdeveloped characters and uneven execution if youre looking for a monster movie masterpiece look elsewhere this ones best left on skull island
Apr 1 2024,positive,i watched this movie in 4dx and 3d which was the best decision ever i honestly thought the movie was amazing and well thought out there were some scenes that made me cry but overall it was filled with exciting monster fighting those movie critics dont know what they are talking about
Apr 1 2024,positive,is kids friendly it shows we show care about each other help each other and follows whats right

Apr 1 2024,positive,as the crossover movie lover this new and intense monsterverse movie makes me amazed too much every scenes where godzilla and kong appeared makes me awesome at first godzilla and kong are rivals but now they are join as one they have both what they fight for awesome
Apr 1 2024,positive,very exciting nonstop action but a little long
Apr 1 2024,positive,i am a huge godzilla fan and some of his movies are garbage i really liked the special  the movie as a whole what you would expect from a godzilla movie plenty of conflict just dont understand why humans are constantly trying to kill him he doesnt bother them
Apr 1 2024,positive,the movie was awesome and action packed skar was a total villain kong was king and godzilla well it says what he is in his name
Apr 1 2024,positive,it was amazing movie

Apr 1 2024,positive,sometimes you just want mindless fun in the theater and for my son and i it was a good time its what i expected plenty of titans fighting and half of the population being destroyed just by their movements lol you want great storytelling character development etc go see godzillia minus one
Apr 1 2024,positive,the public wanted giant monsters fighting thats what we had this specialized critic wanting depth in the script in a film about giant monsters
Apr 1 2024,positive,great visuals and entertaining
Apr 1 2024,negative,the plot was too confusing and things just coincidentally resolved maybe because they couldnt work how to move on with the over complicated plot line it was worse than aquaman
Apr 1 2024,neutral,loved the action didnt care for the human storyline per ususal
Apr 1 2024,positive,its a great movie  top notch action  i dint want it to end  we need another one from this movie franchise 
Apr 1 2024,positive,it was dumb fun all the time this is a movie made by fans for fans

Apr 1 2024,positive,i have seen it long time godzilla fan and kong     this is action packed little story      al about saving the world
Apr 1 2024,positive,i received what i wanted the most since the first monsterverse movie more kaijus and less humans ive watched it twice and ill watch more times because if i get carried away by these critics we wont go to the movies
Apr 1 2024,positive,loved it if you like leathal weapon your going to love kongs  godzilla alpha attitude towards each other  best part it has very little human interruption
Apr 1 2024,positive,absolutely amazing movie  
Apr 1 2024,positive,well if you are an godzilla and kong fan you must watch it avoid the leak footage amd enjoy the movie you will love it
Apr 1 2024,positive,if you want some monster fight this is one for you little drama there few comedy here and a ton of kaiju fights fun to watch but not the best
Apr 1 2024,positive,an average movie i would recommend watching it if you want a movie not to deep its storyline was not very interesting to me but it was alright overall a average movie worth a watch
Apr 1 2024,positive,great movie from the beginning to the end pure adrenaline
Apr 1 2024,positive,to the people who are saying weak story makes no sense humans are useless and especially idiotically comparing it to godzilla minus one respectfully your opinion is trash people watch kaiju films or monster films for the action for the spectacle for world building people dont come into the theatres expecting an intricate and elaborate story from a movie about godzilla and kong seriously if you dont pay attention to the story and just watch the movie as a spectacle as you should you will thoroughly enjoy it the kids will have a blast and it will be a great movie going experience the visuals are stunning the monster fights are amazing lots of intentional or unintentional funny moments 1010 for entertainment value
Apr 1 2024,positive,i went to go see giant monsters fight each other and guess what thats exactly what i got the rest was a pretty good bonus too action was fun there wasnt so many lulls in the plot most things brought up got some sort of payoff and we got to see a lot of worldbuilding bits from the previous movie brought back doug     in short giant monsters hell yeah
Apr 1 2024,positive,the movie was something that any fan could ask for the pacing of the story is good visuals abd effects were great and most importantly mothra is back its now time to watch the movie and judge it yourselves
Apr 1 2024,positive,this movie is so so dumb and i love it its a good way to take the kids out or hang with done friends and have a good time just you some friends and giant wwe style monster battles
Apr 1 2024,positive,you never see these movies for the human element which is unfortunate given there is a lot of real potential for amazing stories to be told that said even with what little runtime the human interaction in this part of the saga brings it does it with more heart than any of the previous entries besides godzilla 2014   there real story here is all wrapped around kong and the other kaiju godzilla is just a beast in this one less emotion tied to him and more protectorpredator     the cgi looks fantastic  the fight scenes are epic  and the new kaiju are beautifully designed     if you love monster movies this one hits
Apr 1 2024,positive,the action was amazing but the ending couldve been better
Apr 1 2024,positive,a few small problems but an amazing and awesome giant monster movie loved the big fight scenes
Apr 1 2024,positive,stunning badass funny rollickingjust the ultimate kaiju romp focused brisk and abundantly epic real ones know
Apr 1 2024,positive,nice addition to the franchise very entertaining and not really any slow dragged out parts
Apr 1 2024,positive,another movie where godzilla had to save kongs ass clearly the king 
Apr 1 2024,positive,absolutely incredible
Apr 1 2024,positive,not the best but has amazing fight scenes ending wasnt my favorite shimo was a let down
Apr 1 2024,positive,definitely has the shock factor
Apr 1 2024,positive,top notch action amazing visuals better human character development and the monster screentime that ive been looking for
Apr 1 2024,positive,an action packed saturday morning cartoon that ends up pulling at your heartstrings    godzilla ex kong the new empire is elevated to new visual heights within the monster verse     the nearly flawless cgi of the characters look amazing integrated with the practical elements of the film    the main villain of scar king was not that major of a threat he did provide some new elements to this world with how intellectual and agile he is    shimo is also a great adversary to the two titans albeit having limited time on screen the power shimo displays creates a unique visual that may rival that of ghidorah    suko was also a great addition to the film as well causing a possible set up for a son of kong film in the future there is a great dynamic between him and kong in this film that shows no matter what happens and what he does kong is still there to look out for him    while i love how these films look and play out there are some flaws that i have        very obvious product placement        no explanation as to where scar kings weapon               came from        the final battle is way too short        all of a sudden random psychic abilities        too much comedy    the human characters i really enjoy for the most part they are more secondary to the story and provide assistance to the titans this time around    what i miss most about these films is serious and drama like in the first godzilla film we need a great balance of serious and frightening tones with action packed and exciting visual scenes for the future entries this universe    overall im going to give this an a
Apr 1 2024,positive,it was pretty cool i had fun with it
Apr 1 2024,positive,i did enjoy it because im a long time godzilla fan it felt kind of corny at times a little bit too much humanistic reaction from the monsters i preferred when the titans felt like big scary monsters with less emotion like dangerous and unhinged that said every godzilla showing was epic  he never fails to be impressive the human story was ok sweet to see the girl still have a relationship with kong  the cgi did seem toned down a notch but it still looks good   overall i give it an 8 out of 10 looking forward to more legendary godzilla
Apr 1 2024,positive,everything was exactly how it should be in a monsterverse movie
Apr 1 2024,positive,not the best but certainly not the worse
Apr 1 2024,positive,it was the best movie of the year so far highly recommended watching it
Apr 1 2024,positive,one of the best movies ive seen with godzilla and kong  will pay to see it again
Apr 1 2024,positive,my family loved it it was fun had a lot of kongs story visually stunning
Apr 1 2024,positive,i like the movie so much with my family and friends
Apr 1 2024,positive,best movie eva for people that been in to the monsterversus from young an it only the beginning of whats more to come in the future  
Apr 1 2024,positive,yes some parts were corny and yes some parts were a little too convenient to the story but as a knock down drag out monster movie this was just so much fun
Apr 1 2024,positive,awesome movie nonstop monster action
Apr 1 2024,neutral,this was all over the place and took to long to get to what we wanted to watch  i went with some hard core fans and a couple agreed it was pretty bad
Apr 1 2024,positive,really fun fast comic book movie  saw it in the 4dx which made it pretty intense
Apr 1 2024,positive,the movie tell the story about kong a lots which is good because hes a friendly neighboorhood to human godzilla is ways to strong that make his enemies become weeker but to fighting  the meeting between titans are good worth everyscene when you see them the story line of human i feel that they better compare with other godzilla movie but still not one of the good point  monarch series talk about human really good i think is the best so they should improve that so that we have something to focus on human example the story that jia meets iwi people and turn out she is the vip that can summon mothra  is doesnt make sense at all beside i hope that other next movies godzilla and kong can find a really worth villains the interact bettween kong and mini kong is fun and cute   the titans scene 1010  worth evertime when you see the titans   the music  8510   the human scene 710   the story 8    overall i give it 810 point i think that human story could be better the titans scene story saves the entire of the movie its worth your time to watch with friend  i watched with my others 3 friend we all like it and for entertainment
Apr 1 2024,positive,enjoyed it immensely
Apr 1 2024,positive,great monster fights chaotic plot terrible acting  i laughed a lot but at the movie not along with it

Apr 1 2024,positive,the film meets many of my expectations as well as being very enjoyable although the human plot is a bit weak but leaving that aside the film is very enjoyable
Apr 1 2024,positive,idc what people say this is probably the best movie in the mv kong skull island is slightly better still but the vibe you get in this movie i love it i love the crazy silly action of the movie and the apes are full of emotion i actually dont mind that they treat godzilla more as a monster then a titant with emotions sometimes he does have emotions but not as much as he did in 2014 and kotm but i wish we got more of godzilla scar king was better then i thought tbh i still dont think hes the biggest threat but hes the smartest one tho he has an army and controls an agent titant but i absolutely loved king in this movie i dont even like kong like that
Apr 1 2024,positive,its actually pretty gas did not expect this movie to be gas and also fk the critics them people mustve watched that sh blindfolded
Apr 1 2024,positive,movie is a great blockbuster for the whole family turn your brain off and enjoy saw it in 4dx and was well worth it critics just do t get what movies like this are trying to do audience clapped at the end of the movie that doesnt happen very often
Apr 1 2024,positive,it a good movie and you should go watch it i hope you feel the same was as i did
Apr 1 2024,positive,this was the best movie i have seen in a long time it felt like three films packed into one after watching it i was shocked to discover it was only two hours long there was so much packed into this movie that i thought it mustve been three hours it was a nonstop thrillride that never took its foot off of the gas the packed dolby theater that i watched in at stood and applauded at the end everyone was smiling and commenting on how good the film was as we left
Apr 1 2024,neutral,corny but lots of action
Apr 1 2024,positive,really good movie really funny and doesnt try to be something its not

Apr 1 2024,positive,absolute fight and cinema
Apr 1 2024,positive,the dialogue was a bit cheesy at times but it made the movie more enjoyable the final battle felt a bit to quick in comparison to the previous ones in the franchise overall a good movie
Apr 1 2024,positive,it was a good time with the family
Apr 1 2024,positive,its very action packed thrilling fun and most importantly has heart but the film doesnt give you time to breathe and really appreciate whats happening nonetheless i dont hate the movie i understand that its meant to be fun which is why i give it a 710
Apr 1 2024,positive,tribute to era showa
Apr 1 2024,positive,i loved it monsters brawl and less humans just focused on the monsters going at it i wish they added a credit scene hopefully they can make another movie again with the same formula or better best godzilla  kong movie great job
Apr 1 2024,positive,i give this movie 10 out of 10 my son loved it
Apr 1 2024,positive,the movie was really good i enjoyed the action godzilla kick butt that shoulder hit from godzilla was dope but the humans had more screen time than godzilla the new enemies are a nice new take and change in enemies and villains mothras rebirth was nice too but godzilla should have seen more screen time if adam wingard makes another i hope he delivers on his saying godzilla will be more focused on in the next movie the action thrill fighting godzillas power up was nice i hope this monsterversus continues especially for godzilla
Apr 1 2024,positive,if you are ready for an exciting edgeofyourseat special effectsheavy thrill ride look no further than the highly anticipated continuation of the monsterverse this is the most highpaced actionheavy entry yet with more monster fights than you can shake a stick at in spite of that it also contains heartfelt character moments and development of both characters and the monsterverse storyline as the great lore continues to expand with a few surprises in store dont miss seeing this one on the big screen
Apr 1 2024,positive,although it is flawed with lightning fast pace and still weak human story it makes up with amazingly choreographed fights funny characters and kongs story arc
Apr 1 2024,positive,more monster screen time than human screen time
Apr 1 2024,neutral,youve gotta just start laughing half way through because you were the one that paid to see this movie and its really your fault and no one elses

Apr 1 2024,positive,this movie surprised me it is such a great ride lots of jokes and funny moments the little kong was a star of the movie you have to watch but he is not as innocent as he looks the action scenes are fun and enjoyable and the effects are great a team up movie was just what this needed i cant wait to see where they will take this next is this a serious technical movie nope its a fun enjoyable ride with plenty of moments to remember
Apr 1 2024,positive,worth it to watch and enjoyable pure action and fast fighting  not facking slow motion fight like japanese version

Apr 1 2024,positive,great movie dont listen to the dumb critics critics are so out of touch these days they are basically useless just look at the audience score this movie is for the fans and it is fun go in expecting fun monster battles action and you wont be disappointed other people expecting minus 1 or something writing and got disappointed are just plain dumb
Apr 1 2024,positive,if you are an absolute diehard true fan of godzilla you would not care otherwise what this movie is yes there are silly things that happen during this movie and the plot did not make sense at all true diehard godzilla fans will appreciate this movie for what fun it is and i was one of those lucky people to experience it in imax with the true diehard fans
Apr 1 2024,positive,absolutely loved it  just ridiculous destruction and absolute choas what an action movie is supposed to be
Apr 1 2024,positive,theres gotta be more such a good movie
Apr 1 2024,positive,great action from beginning to end what more can a godzillaking kong fan want
Apr 1 2024,positive,really good story with a lot of action and suspense my wife didnt fall asleep to it so thats a plus lol
Apr 1 2024,positive,please go watch it and dont listen to these socalled movie critics who dont know anything about movies and just want to be part of something godzilla kong the new empire was amazing fun and exciting and i cant wait for more to be made 55
Apr 1 2024,positive,the dream of fans of monsters fights come true hey and the humans  excellent villan   all hail king kong
Apr 1 2024,positive,i love the movie i really dont know what critics expected from a monster movie  btw i wish more screen time to mothra and more better using of shimo
Apr 1 2024,positive,pretty goodnice movie
Apr 1 2024,positive,absolutely perfect great ratio of monster to monster action with light human involvement basically exactly what the fans asked for
Apr 1 2024,positive,best action packed hilarious tag team movie ive ever seen 5 stars
Apr 1 2024,positive,i enjoyed this movie even if it lacks a couple things but overall it was good
Apr 1 2024,positive,fun movie if you like kaiju fighting if you dont like that then why are you even seeing it the required human storyline was actually bearable and funny enough not to bring down the real stars of the show
Apr 1 2024,positive,was super pleased that it had so much focus on the monsters and not the paltry humans it helped my 5 year old really stay involved and entertained the paid critics will bellyache about the substance but thats not the focus here the actors were great in the back seat roles commendable jobs all around
Apr 1 2024,positive,it is amazing i loved it so much please everyone going see it please
Apr 1 2024,positive,the movie was incredible i recommend everybody to go see it it was absolutely amazing and awesome and incredible and beautiful and heartwarming and bringing families and friends together and it was an incredible movie
Apr 1 2024,positive,not as good as godzilla v kong the new empire is fun film if you wanna enjoy the action sequences if youre here for the story then this is not it
Apr 1 2024,positive,while certainly fun it is a come down from godzilla versus kong the less is more strategy gets cast aside for a dizzying concoction of sound and color the set pieces are less interesting than the previous outting and we lose a sense of scale with almost all the titan action happening within hollow earth dan stevens is fun and the synth score is great but the balance that was had in earlier installments is mostly lost its better than godzilla king of the monsters and more enjoyable than godzilla 2014 but a middling entry into the monsterverse
Apr 1 2024,positive,i havent seen so much action in a movie in a long time  great fight scenes  lots of giant monsters love this movie
Apr 1 2024,positive,it was a good movie but i liked gidzilla v kong better i loved the monsters teaming up and the help from mothra
Apr 1 2024,positive,fun movie my kids especially loved it
Apr 1 2024,positive,the movie is awesome just some straight up big monster fight none of the human bullshit the human element are good somewhat as well but at the end it basically pacific rim not the second movie but with monsters
Apr 1 2024,positive,while some scenes felt a bit rushed especially the ones with godzilla in it it was still an amazing movie my eyes was glued to the screen the entire time
Apr 1 2024,positive,this movie was what i would expect from a king kong and godzilla movie  lots of action and great visuals  the story is decent its not great but not bad  its good enough it was sold out at 2 theaters we had to go to a 3rd one to watch it  although the 3rd place one was less advance and up to date technology  it was still a great show  a little violent for kids younger than 10 though  if you want a good time and want to watch a smash and fight them show go watch this
Apr 1 2024,positive,human characters are ok they had a couple funny moments but the monsters make this movie absolutely worth your time
Apr 1 2024,positive,movie was so good so glad i just seen it might go back and see it again
Apr 1 2024,positive,movie has everything a monsterverse fan could want a lot of giant monsters more scenes with kong and godzilla than the humans fights scenes were entertaining as hell giving more of backstory to kong scar king was such a great villain ruthless leader who would do anything to get what he wants shimo godzilla was so cool would recommend it to someone
Apr 1 2024,positive,not a chance a king kong or godzilla nerd will leave disappointed
Apr 1 2024,positive,fun movie watching godzilla kick every titans butt
Apr 1 2024,positive,the movie was straight up awesome and monster brawling they introduced many new other titans like tiamut and scylla although the final battle lacked a little bit the movie had emotions comedy actions and a very good story
Apr 1 2024,positive,great cast and great story loved getting to know kong more and he was very consistent in character
Apr 1 2024,positive,if your a fan of giant monsters fighting each other this movie is definitely for you and if i were you i recommend watch the monster verse movies and you will understand this movie so you dont get lost and confused this movie is very funny and the best monster verse movie with nice action and crazy moments good job adam
Apr 1 2024,positive,honestly a great film  with adrenaline from beginning to end a sequel will definitely be made  i hope they keep the script balanced
Apr 1 2024,positive,weve been spoiled by these great godzilla films over the last few months entertaining and fun from start to finish a big flashy summer blockbuster type movie with a bunch of cgi if you expected a movie similar to minus 1 im sorry but you should see the other monsterverse movies to understand this movie
Apr 1 2024,positive,freaking awesome actionpacked ride from literally the first scene
Apr 1 2024,positive,very fun amazing action good plot its the best movie in the monsterverse a fan of godzilla or kong watch it warning to godzilla fans it is a kong center story
Apr 1 2024,positive,fantastic full of awesome fight sequences and solid followup to gvk
Apr 1 2024,positive,mini kong is the best 
Apr 1 2024,positive,loved this movie  all of my favorite titans cant wait to see again
Apr 1 2024,negative,movie felt rushed the cgi and all the action scenes were pretty bland overall story felt cringe at times of course kong gets more screen time than godzilla dont waste your time or money
Apr 1 2024,positive,this movie is for fans  who cares what the critics think  no it isnt godzilla minus one its a continuation of a storyline that began in 2014  this is told from the kaijus perspective  i saw it on an imax screen as big as the wall of a building  it was great but overwhelming  i suggest seeing it on a normal movie screen  you wont be overwhelmed
Apr 1 2024,positive,when i first walked in to go see this film my expectations were low given the last film did not have as great of a plot as other monster verse films though when i left i felt that this film did a great job of giving a good story set in this established universe    this film unlike the other monsterverse films does a good job of making sure that the titans get their time to shine on the screen i felt the film was much more focused on them and had a lot more sequences featuring them unlike godzilla king of the monsters and godzilla vs kong and the humans in this movie actually had good sequences and good scenes when they were on screen unlike the last movie which i felt they were just kinda pointless in the whole scenario of things i even felt that the hollow earth uncharted areas were cool to discover and discover that the iwi tribe had connections to the titans way before anyone else did i am titans down there were very well designed and even the titans on the actual earth were very well designed i even liked exploring godzillas preparation for the scar king by gaining and absorbing enough radiation to take him on the humans i felt were good characters in addition to the story and actually had good reason for being involved in the plot unlike the last film or some of the characters just didnt really need to be there    i felt the scar king was actually a pretty well set up villain in the story we had some background behind them and what his motives were and we even got to witness him in action which i felt was very cool to witness even discovering the existence of shimo was very cool he was basically just the scar kings puppet and i felt that was very cool to see i felt like scar king had enough motive and reason for being a powerful major threat in this whole film in general i even enjoyed baby kong and his scenes on screen and im excited to see him in the next film i kind of felt even though it is called godzilla x kong i felt kong was mainly the star of the whole film even though i enjoyed seeing his sequences i felt that godzilla was just kind of there and wasnt really balanced out on screen with kong but the final battle really made that better it was a very cool sequence i felt the fight was very well choreographed and the cgi during it was phenomenal as well i am very excited to see where the next film goes given this film had a good story good plot and great cgi     overall godzilla x kong the new empire is a very entertaining film it delivers a good story while at the same time giving you great action sequences and gives you a worth of your money it gets an 810 in my book would recommend to any fan of the monsterverse and godzilla or kong
Apr 1 2024,positive,the movie was great but as a movie call godzilla x kong i was expecting much more about godzilla and we did not see a really good fight until almost the end anyway the movie still looking great and the fight between kong x godzilla vs scar king x shimo was great hope to see more about monsterverse soon
Apr 1 2024,positive,fun movie definitely a popcorn flick where you go in and just enjoy the action great visuals
Apr 1 2024,positive,the movie was amazing i love the effects for the underworld and the mid world the sound affects were great the big screen made it seam like kong was looking right at you the story line was good  its a must see 
Apr 1 2024,positive,this movie is absolutely amazing it is what you want in a monster movie the cgi is great and the monsters are well done from a story telling stand point as someone who has loved godzilla since i was a child and his movies this is my favorite one yet i know it is mostly kong but the big g shines when he is on screen     much like godzilla vs kong i wish it was 2 12 hours long to flush out the story and lore a little more just a personal opinion i am really interested in where they go next
Apr 1 2024,negative,i didnt even watch movie i ordered it at wrong place
Apr 1 2024,negative,it has action which is what many people are looking for but honestly the direction this franchise has taken is totally and absolutely full of a silly fantasy
Apr 1 2024,positive,enjoy it for what it ismonsters  monsters  and more monsters  the story line is meh but the monsters are always cool  does anyone really watch godzilla movies for the plot
Apr 1 2024,positive,loved every minute of it it started off with action and ended with action the plot is amazing and picture and colors was great
Apr 1 2024,positive,awesome movie 1010 in my opinion
Apr 1 2024,positive,one of the best godzilla movies ive seen so far lots of action and so much monster battles really reminds me of the showa era films i hope legendary will keep this alive with more godzilla and kong sequel for the upcoming future im really hoping for some heisei godzilla villains like spacegodzilla or better yet destoroyah
Apr 1 2024,positive,we loved this movie lots of action and a good old fashion happy ending that you walk away feeling satisfied
Apr 1 2024,positive,this was crazy its like a feature length theme park ride
Apr 1 2024,positive,good movie the 4d was amazing
Apr 1 2024,positive,great movie lots of action and funny
Apr 1 2024,positive,loved it finally a movie we wanted just monsters whooping on each other
Apr 1 2024,positive,although the movie was a bit fast paced and had short action scenes i know that there will be more of these movies coming and over all is a fun movie to watch
Apr 1 2024,positive,loved it nonstop action
Apr 1 2024,positive,if all you want is action and great fight scenes then watch but if youre expecting more dont bother overall it was entertaining and i wasnt bored at all but i was also glad when it was over i  thought the fights were great but the acting couldve been better and the movie felt a bit rushed at times id recommend it to no one except those who want to spend two hours watching action cartoons
Apr 1 2024,neutral,the story is hurried and rushed as is the cgi in several scenes while somewhat satisfying a mediocre sequel to its better produced better developed predecessor gvk  hollywood fumbles yet another franchise overfocused on mind numbing action and fx and not enough on story crafting and character development  the film feels rushed to the box office and thereby in my humble opinion  no rush to see this one theaters
Apr 1 2024,positive,godzilla x kong was an overall satisfactory film absolutely amazing as a modern kaiju fan as we recently had godzilla minus one this film follows up from the american monsterverse from warner brothers and they continue the story with kong in the hollow earth this film is definitely kong focused godzillas presence is felt as a means to keep the surface safe and thats efficient and effective this film has lots of heart honestly this one of the most fun movies under the monsterverse and im so excited that the next film is going to be more godzilla focused i absolutely want more godzilla films the monster action the hollow earth portions and the portions featuring jia were so amazing if you like the monsterverse youll definitely like this movie
Apr 1 2024,negative,the reclinable seat on p2 did not work
Apr 1 2024,positive,overall a fun movie good monster fight scenes and must see if youre looking for a fun ride
Apr 1 2024,positive,godzilla x kong delivers on its promise of nonstop entertainment with thrilling monster battles and relentless action kongs humanistic portrayal adds depth to the colossal showdown showcasing his empathy towards humans and fellow apes godzillas relentless rampage throughout the film underscores his formidable power the exploration of hollow earth adds an intriguing layer of mystery with the introduction of skar king and its captivating lore while the final showdown may have felt somewhat lacking it still satisfies in witnessing the titans clash the cgi though occasionally shaky effectively immerses viewers in the epic spectacle overall godzilla vs kong is a thoroughly entertaining ride that leaves audiences eager for more very interested in seeing where is goes next
Apr 1 2024,positive,i do not understand how this movie got  55  on rt i totally agree with the audience and their 93 rt score  this movie was enjoyable  a great movie worth watching again  lil kong rocks
Apr 1 2024,neutral,excellent cgi definitely you need to watch it imax
Apr 1 2024,positive,this movie is what it set out to do entertain this is not minus one and it wasnt meant to be this is what a big monster movie should be fun as i watched it everyone in my theater had a smile myself included will be buying it day one
Apr 1 2024,positive,the movie definitely gives us the experience of excitement and caring on whats next to come 
Apr 1 2024,positive,my nine year son loved every minute of this movie
Apr 1 2024,positive,great story beginning and end left room   for more in the future 85 out of 10 most  definitely a must 
Apr 1 2024,positive,amazing action and more kaiju screen time than gvk
Apr 1 2024,positive,this movie was amazing period
Apr 1 2024,positive,i thought that this was a very fun and movie and i enjoyed watching it i would definitely recommend it to other people who like giant monster movies
Apr 1 2024,positive,the movie is a lot of non stop action that is very entertaining but very quick its also very gorey the human characters are sidelined which i dont really care about because they werent all that interesting the cgi is pretty good for modern movies its a flawed but fun movie
Apr 1 2024,positive,a fun action flick for everyone to like but dont compare it to minus one if it wasnt for these films there wouldnt have been shin or minus one
Apr 1 2024,positive,ridiculous and fun  probably should be 4 stars but i dont want to bring the average down  this move is a big budget version of the cartoony 70s godzilla movies  i loved those as a kid and i loved this one  im sorry if you are so mature now that you cant remember what it was like to be a kid
Apr 1 2024,positive,a good follow up to its predecessor but just kicks it up a whole other level a 2 hour movie that gives you no time to breath just perpetual action throughout if you want to see giant monsters fight it out on the big screen this movie is for you tremendously fun movie that you will enjoy watching but make no mistakes this movie will be taking home zero oscars next year
Apr 1 2024,positive,i decided to experience it in 3d and while the effect was fun its not needed to enjoy the film  which is a good thing  if the only thing a movie has going for it is the gimmick then its not a good movie  thats not the case here  the film does feel like it focuses more on kong than godzilla as thats where all of the emotional beats are  kong is written with a strong sense of humanity while godzilla is a pissed off force of nature while not the best outing in the monsterverse franchise this was a solid fun watch
Apr 1 2024,positive,the ending was unexpected but loved it
Apr 1 2024,positive,some spoilers loved it i watched it on opening night and if you watch the monster fight moving for the monster fighting like a normal critic you will be very pleased it focuses on the titans first and it had great fight had amazing scenes it doesnt come without flaws the humans story is fine not perfect but i liked how it refrenced past storys with the idea of people having physic connections with mothra i think shimo shouldve gotten more time to shine but thats me and doug was in it so it was peak automatically
Apr 1 2024,positive,the best so far now i know why they got that oscar
Apr 1 2024,positive,the movie theaters is the truth
Apr 1 2024,positive,gxk is supposed to sort of be a nod to the shows era of godzilla movies and it does this perfectly well the cgi is phenomenal and i would 100 recommend it
Apr 1 2024,positive,definitely the best movie in the monsterverse in this edition the kaijus shine without any concealment the human stories are accessory what it really means to see the titans in all their splendor
Apr 1 2024,positive,undoubtedly peak movie
Apr 1 2024,positive,good overall flick just what a movie is supposed to beentertaining i like mothra in this one
Apr 1 2024,neutral,yet again they trying to make kong better than  godzilla its starting to be very annoying we barely get to see any godzilla its all about kong kong kong  godzilla could take on kong skar and shimu all at the same time
Apr 1 2024,neutral,it does what it is meant to do by giving awesome giant monster fights but sometimes i feel like it takes itself too seriously it is entertaining but nothing special and many plot holes within the story
Apr 1 2024,positive,i definetly enjoyed the movie alot though it was very fast paced at the very least we got alot of kaiju scenes and they were very good very good sad that scylla and tiamat didnt last that long wish it lasted way longer if they just straight off killed them  but anyways this movie was great really enjoyed it had some laughs and all of that stuff the kaijus had great emotions into them especially to kong suko skar king and the great apes the way they were done was phenomenal absolutely well done for their characters emotions and characteristics and godzilla seeing him suck out radiation got me jaw dropped that was just so freakin cool and i didnt expect him to evolve that fast and there were alot of references to the old films aswell from ebirah horror of the deep werein godzilla jumped into the water
Apr 1 2024,positive,i love it its dope af
Apr 1 2024,positive,great action and story could have used more of the villain but otherwise awesome movie my 8 and 12 year old loved it
Apr 1 2024,positive,its a really great movie its a really fun gathering of titans its really fun i hope this universe can continue
Apr 1 2024,positive,movie was better than i expected it to be
Apr 1 2024,positive,its too epic and exciting
Apr 1 2024,positive,well the human story was minimal but not boring monster action and story was really good though i feel like kongs hollow earth story had shrek vibes maybe a little more godzilla next time he felt like a side character in his own film
Mar 31 2024,positive,godzilla x kong was awesome and didnt take itself too seriously something that hollywood would do well to pay attention to i personally love how many scenes have monsters communicating with expressions and no dialoguei miss the days when old movies would do that nowadays movies dont seem to think their audiences are smart enough to figure out whats going on without them explaining you can convey a lot more without words sometimes and i love it i also love how godzilla and kongs stories are slowly building id hate to spoil anything but each monster gets a significant power boost in this movie and ends up in a better place at the end this movie was an absolute blast from start to finish and im planning on seeing it again soon
Mar 31 2024,positive,good movie lots of action fights scenes felt like i was back in my childhood playing save the earth on ps2 story could use some work but the acting and action make up for it absolute blast 
Mar 31 2024,positive,godzilla x kong    big dumb monster movie with a capital dumb    the script reads like it was written by two twelve year olds playing with their action figures in the sandbox    my giant lizard breaths fire  oh yeah well my giant lizard breathes ice  lets have them fight in the air because somebody turned off gravity  okay weeeee    its absolutely ridiculous     that said if you ever enjoyed a big dumb monster movie on a saturday afternoon as a kid turn your brain off unlock your inner 12 year old and just have fun with it    if you want a godzilla movie with heart and emotion and depth see godzilla minus one    if you want giant monsters smashing the pyramids get yourself a bucket of popcorn and a temporary lobotomy and enjoy this one
Mar 31 2024,positive,it was so awesome and i will see it over and over again i love godzilla since i was a kid
Mar 31 2024,positive,a movie made by fans for the fans this movie was an absolute banger and was so fun to watch i was on the edge of my seat waiting to see 2 colossal giants join forces once again 
Mar 31 2024,positive,just a great time at the movie just entertaining and fun highly recommend if you are fans of the big guys
Mar 31 2024,positive,this was yet another movie for the fans take the acting in these movies with a grain of salt  the movie was entertaining it gives the people what they want more godzilla kong and other kaijus i wont spoil the fight scenes were awesome if youre a godzilla or kong fan go check it out
Mar 31 2024,positive,this has instantly become one of my favorite movies ever the action is just plain awesome its fastpaced which i like its got likeable human characters and excellent use of show dont tell i dont care what the useless critics on this platform say this movie used this maxim to its full use they convey so many ideas emotions and concepts through king kong scar king and suko mini kong without saying a single word i absolutely loved kong in this movie and i think they used godzilla well as well the entirety of this movie is just incredible and i absolutely love it no manner of critics can ruin my enjoyment of this masterpiece 1010
Mar 31 2024,positive,enjoyed it a lot as a godzilla fan and fan of all things kaiju this film really knew what fans wanted the villain isnt the strongest our heroes have faced but oozes personality and is delightfully evil its a great addition to the monsterverse
Mar 31 2024,positive,it is exactly what you should expect as a monsterverse fan over the years these movies have gotten more action packed and less focused on a dense plot to cling on to this movie gives the monsters lots of screen time and is exactly what us monsterverse fans wanted great movie overall
Mar 31 2024,negative,monarch was significantly better
Mar 31 2024,positive,most of these critics are pretentious failed hollywood wannabes who dont get what their job is many of them are bashing films because they simply just dont like its genre  for example godzilla minus one is a giant monster drama film while godzilla x kong is a different genre its a giant monster action flick i dont like romance comedies but i can technically and objectively review it for fans who like romcoms so critics should be able to recommend a movie for others even if they dont like the particular genre godzilla x kong was fun with great giant monster action
Mar 31 2024,positive,this movie is an absolutely must see explosion from beginning to end you will be so excited and on the edge of your seat my boyfriend and i went to go see it and we loved it we enjoyed every minute of it ten out of ten must see again
Mar 31 2024,positive,great fun its a movie that knows what the audiences want and it gives it to them critics should come to realize the genre has an audience and not all movies should be psychological and deep if you want that from godzilla theres minus one for ya
Mar 31 2024,positive,its a turn your brain off and just enjoy movie great visual effects and lots of action whats not to like
Mar 31 2024,positive,the most epic movie i ever seen magnificent cgi was perfection i give a 10 out of 10
Mar 31 2024,positive,best movie love the story line how godzilla put the other giants apes and skar king back to there prison and why they want to come back to earth 
Mar 31 2024,positive,super fun exactly what you would want out of a monster verse movie just wish there was a little more explanation to certain things
Mar 31 2024,positive,awesome great cgi and action sequences
Mar 31 2024,positive,it was easy to purchase tickets i loved the movie
Mar 31 2024,positive,this was a fun movie to watch especially being able to watch it in imax 3d which was a first for me the visuals are stunning and the monster fights are fantastic this one is far from perfect though i did not like how they would create problems and then basically magically find a solution within one or two minutes of the movie i also do not like how its spent most of the time in hallow earth so you cannot really see the shear size of the monsters in relation everything else their ginormous size is what makes this so amazing and some of that is lost for a good chunk of the movie overall a great movie though
Mar 31 2024,positive,it was fun and action packed story line was convoluted far fetchedabsurd convenient and predictable but that was all to be expected graphics i thought could have been better still though you can never go wrong with kong and godzilla
Mar 31 2024,positive,there is nothing to dislike its action packed with beautiful graphics
Mar 31 2024,positive,gets the blood flowing
Mar 31 2024,positive,super fun my 11 year old son loved it
Mar 31 2024,positive,legendary took a concept that had no business being made into a movie or even being greenlighted or hell even being considered and delivered what is in my opinion the second best kaiju moveever sorry gmo will be considerably tougher to beat than gnk has a chance of doing from the opening scene to the end of the film and no matter how predictable any of the events in the movie might have been such as jia being mothras herald any selfrespecting godzila fan should have been able to call that one months before mothras cameo was divulged gnk delivered an excellent piece of entertainment
Mar 31 2024,positive,this was a good fun movie cgi was better than anything that came out of disney since end game fight scenes were incredible this was a good action packed movie
Mar 31 2024,positive,full of action really enjoyed w
Mar 31 2024,positive,a perfect movie to shut off your brain and have fun
Mar 31 2024,negative,i went to go watch this movie because i knew there would be giant monsters fighting each other and i knew the action would be incredible which it was if the humans werent in this movie id give it 5 stars the humans waste so much of this movies runtime and they have been very poorly casted they really annoyed me throughout this movie and all i really wanted to see was scar king
Mar 31 2024,positive,pretty good entertaining film go watch and get hype
Mar 31 2024,positive,its a nearly perfect giant monster movie there are three bad ideas in it and combined they arent enough to be a concern
Mar 31 2024,positive,this movie is a fun and epic adventure for godzilla and kong fans this is a must watch in theaters
Mar 31 2024,positive,the best one in the series so far
Mar 31 2024,positive,a lot of ridiculous fun good visuals and a story that makes me care for the human characters more
Mar 31 2024,positive,its a romp lots of monster action carries the story forward good fun
Mar 31 2024,positive,good story as always not enough of godzilla when will american directors learn we are godzilla fans
Mar 31 2024,negative,worst king konggodzilla movie i have ever seen and i have seen all of them
Mar 31 2024,positive,incredible very funny
Mar 31 2024,positive,awesome best one yet
Mar 31 2024,negative,i want to start by saying i am a huge monster movie fan the first pacific rim is my favorite film of all time that being said every single element of this movie was bad gvk wasnt great but i could still often fast forward to the fight scenes and have a great time after watching this once i will never do that easily the worst human characters of any monster verse movie thus far they are not even acting simply narrating the story with endless ridiculous exposition the story seems like it was just made up as they went while it got super ridiculous during the hollow earth human subplot special effects are easily the worst of any godzilla or kong movie made in the past 20 years and yes that includes the 2005 kong somehow all horror elements are nowhere to be found i thought the sense of scale was subpar in pacific rim 2 but it is completely lost here especially when kong was interacting with the other apes the poor cg backgrounds makes them all look slightly larger than humans godzilla is olympics diving into the ocean off of a mountain in front of a city with virtually no side effects compare this to the 2014 film where him simply emerging from the ocean damn near caused a tsunami drowning out an entire city i kid you not at one point he even suplexes kong with perfect form after defeating some other horribly animated monsters shortly after he absorbs i think more radiation than ever before and kong manages to knock him out somehow this makes no sense godzilla could have easily defeated scar king which killed any suspense of the final battle which is not good despite people saying this film still delivers on that front there is literally a slow motion avengers scene of all the monsters charging at eachother before engaging in the somehow least interesting fight of any monster verse movie so far the movies only redeeming quality is the dynamic between kong and diddy kong actually worked much better than i thought after seeing the trailers save your money and buy pacific rim or kong skull island instead or watch king of the monsters if you can stand following the nauseating milli bobbi brown around for 2 hours
Mar 31 2024,neutral,i liked the movie but some of the scenes felt rushed like when godzilla was fighting that monster in the water it felt so quick or when godzilla was getting his evolution theres not much detail on it and they didnt really show much about it   they didnt introduce shimo and skar king till it was near the end of the movie and it felt like they just put something together because the movie was basically over at that point this movie just felt like an episode instead of an actual movie
Mar 31 2024,positive,great for a long fan but im team godzilla but they do just flash to him and just remind you hes there but other than that great movie and great plot a must see
Mar 31 2024,negative,the movie felt fun and had good jokes from time to time but it didnt have any real lasting impact or effect  just felt like like it was taking place in a game  like brawhalla the choreography is flawed most of the time the fights are going on too fast to take in  its sad to say alot was to expected but little was recieved as the titans are far too humanized you can relate kong to kratos more than you can to any other iteration of the character  at most it felt like they completely disregarded a working script for the humans  although it would be better to have a more serious take for the franchise as a whole it  might be far too late for that
Mar 31 2024,positive,great graphics story line was wonderful
Mar 31 2024,positive,hands down best movie of the year so far
Mar 31 2024,positive,great family action
Mar 31 2024,positive, mind blowing fun we never wanted it to end
Mar 31 2024,positive,this movie is the definition of peak this movie had crying and choking on popcorn this movie doesnt deserve a 55 i dont what the fuck is up with critics but i hope they make a sequel to gxk i hope it will follows godzilla story deeper
Mar 31 2024,negative,the movie was a bore
Mar 31 2024,positive,fun monster movie stuff quickly paced
Mar 31 2024,positive,good movie i would recommend it 2 hours long but didnt feel like it at all
Mar 31 2024,positive,awesome critics are ridiculous get a real job lol the audience is happy
Mar 31 2024,positive,if youre a fan of both godzilla and kong youll love this movie it has a lot of fillers that answer questions i didnt even know i had very exciting and made the titans more than just destructive
Mar 31 2024,negative,this movie has spun too far from any king kong and godzilla storyline
Mar 31 2024,positive,this was a great movie to watch your kids and very entertaining with non stop action and a good story

Mar 31 2024,positive,great movie  effects were awesome  a little cheesy here and there but all in all it was awesome
Mar 31 2024,positive,this movie had lots of action storyline couldve been helped with a better script but the actors did well with the scripts they were given monsters were great kongs facial expressions were all heartfelt fighting scene were epic as can be again godzilla was the king of the monsters loved this movie takes me back to my childhood days i hope they give us more
Mar 31 2024,positive,great entertainment screw the critics this movie was fun and engaging the whole 2 hrs
Mar 31 2024,positive,i got what i expected
Mar 31 2024,positive,felt like it was a little rushed but overall a great movie with lots of action and very entertaining hope they keep the franchise going with more shows and movies
Mar 31 2024,negative,do not fall for it godzilla and kong are not shipped they dont make out even once
Mar 31 2024,negative,all the money went towards the graphics and movie locations but only the few cents went towards the writing so many unnecessary scenes
Mar 31 2024,positive,loved everything about it great action great story love the new look to godzilla
Mar 31 2024,positive,my new favorite of the legendary monsterverse as a kong man i loved seeing him so much this was just pure and simple fun
Mar 31 2024,positive,it was entertaining human story line was alright kong story line   cant trust the tomato score every time looking forward to the next sequel
Mar 31 2024,positive,really enjoyed it very much a movie that does what it says on the tin was able to switch my brain off for a couple of hours and just enjoy a good monster movie as always the human side tends to be the weaker side of the plot but i felt like this time it was done pretty well and trapper is a great character
Mar 31 2024,positive,the best movie in the monsterverse so far i enjoyed the movie all the way baby kong stole the show for me
Mar 31 2024,positive,its made for godzilla fans non stop titian packed action it kinda reminded me of thor ragnarok 
Mar 31 2024,positive,easy 1010  love it
Mar 31 2024,positive,fun movie cool monsters 20 minutes too long kong and godzilla wrestling on the pyramids was cool
Mar 31 2024,positive,this is a big dumb fun movie i wish it had a better plot and story but this movie is only interested in its own visuals like a string of great action scenes  with a thin plot that connects them the movie is fast paced so you dont think about the plot holes until the credits roll no where near as compelling as godzilla minus one  but a fun time regardless  godzilla fighting titans was especially cool to watch
Mar 31 2024,negative,so much time wasted at the start felt like there was some unnecessary scenes
Mar 31 2024,positive,dumb  overly plotted but delivers a tightly paced nonstop action thrill ride that will satisfy most fans of the genre
Mar 31 2024,positive,i love it epic movie good ending
Mar 31 2024,positive,if you want a great plot see godzilla minus 1if you want awesome giant monsters fighting this movie will definitely put a smile on your face reminds me of the great popcorn flicks of old
Mar 31 2024,positive,i have been a die hard fan since i was 5 having minus one be such a great film and then having one of the funnest godzilla movies ever follow up to that has been a great joy in my life  this was amazing and made for godzilla fans this movie had so many call backs to the old movies and it was just absolutely a fun ride seeing it again
Mar 31 2024,positive,movie was action packed from the very beginning this one was really great and funny at times hope they make more with kong and godzilla  specially working together more people should go and see
Mar 31 2024,positive,best movie of kong and godzilla
Mar 31 2024,neutral,i liked the continuous action
Mar 31 2024,positive,this movie blew me away beautiful world monster fights wont you disappointed and really opening the monster verse world  blows anything disneymarvel has made in the recent years out of the water
Mar 31 2024,positive,this movie was perfect dumb fun i was smiling from ear to ear for the whole movie this movie fulfilled all my fantasies of what i wanted to see in the monsterverse
Mar 31 2024,neutral,i think the aggregate score 55 is about right  id give it a 5 or 6 out of 10  i thought a lot of the cgi looked pretty bad  just too fake or unreal  the cgi in previous monster verse films didnt bother me much  its true that there isnt much story human interactions or any kind of thoughtful depth  i didnt like the look or tone of scar and his evil clan   honestly the more i  think about it i really really did not like this movie much at all  im glad my 7 year old did  after enjoying the previous 4 monster verse films i hope they find a new director and a new direction
Mar 31 2024,positive,i really loved it forget what the critics say at the end of the day it is your money so spend however you want and i tell you this moving is worth spending your money on it is so fun to watch
Mar 31 2024,negative,this movie may finally have killed both the godzilla  kong franchises    a nonsensical mess with an underwhelming antagonist and third act     godzilla could have easily won without kong
Mar 31 2024,negative,godzilla new empire was somewhat dull the story is ok but extremely bad when humans are involved the last 45 minutes are the most fun part of the movie while the rest is just boring i dont know how many exposition dialogues you have in this movie but after two of them its way too much in fact i would have appreciated a no dialogues movie with only the monsters and from their point of view the messiah part with the girl is just predictable the acting is average if not awful but the actors have bad dialogues to start with cgi is still great tho with the action music is ok some sounds effects are just misplaced and very repetitive i give it 42 this doesnt compared well after godzilla minus one
Mar 31 2024,positive,this movie is everything real godzilla and kong want in a movie absolutely electric 5 out of 5 stars
Mar 31 2024,positive,this movie was great more giant monsters and less human storyline nobody goes to see a godzilla or kong movie for the human dialogue except g minus 1 we want to see giant monsters fighting each other and ripping civilization to shreds a
Mar 31 2024,positive,i have zero clue what these critics are talking about this movie cannot be compared to minus one and saying this is a bad movie this movie is one of if not the best movie ive ever seen
Mar 31 2024,positive,excellent will definitely be buying the dvd
Mar 31 2024,positive,the movie was awesome pure action lots of monster time the plot and story were great and work excellent with the scenes
Mar 31 2024,positive,this movie was so much fun it was a joyride from start to finish although the human characters can be slightly tedious at times i still love jias character trapper and bernie are actually funny which i didnt expect the action was absolutely insane like i dont think my jaw left the floor the whole movie loved it will absolutely see it at least one more time definitely recommend imax it was so special
Mar 31 2024,positive,saw it twice i wanted to see monsters throw hands and thats what i got just might see it again i enjoyed it immensely
Mar 31 2024,positive,great monster vs monster movie a must see in 3d
Mar 31 2024,positive,for a godzilla fan its a great movie reference to the classic shows era really takes me back and the monster battles makes me feel like a kid again the human story could be better but doesnt disappoint from the monster perspective the villain could have had more consequence which i hope has more in future movies almost like a win but at what cost from the monster perspective overall solid 75 out of 10 and bodes well for the monsterverse future long live the king teamgodzilla
Mar 31 2024,positive,i love the action sequences of the empire it show more screen time of kong my downside godzilla got less screen time in the movie overall i wound recommend to any godzilla and kong fans who are looking for a godzilla and kong movie  this they should definitely see i give the new empire a 1010
Mar 31 2024,positive,was ok  not great but it is just a monster movie  was fun enough to watch
Mar 31 2024,positive,delivers exactly what you expect from this version titans fighting titans with epic scenes and a lot of action good pacing and some funny scenes
Mar 31 2024,positive,a must see for both godzilla and kong fans i highly recommend this film for anyone looking for a thrilling action movie that goes above and beyond in terms of visual characters and story the only downside is it doesnt help new fans fill in on the other movies in the monsterverse but at the same time it pushes them into the right path to want to watch the other films absolutely love this movie and im so excited for more
Mar 31 2024,positive,without a doubt the best film in the franchise yes it may have its flaws mainly due to the story but director adam promoted it it delivered the insane fight of the titans especially the final fight here in rio de janeiro thank you very much for the reference ha ha there is team king kong until eternity
Mar 31 2024,positive,i just saw that movie in imax at amc theaters at newport kentucky today and it was epic and awesome and fun and excellent
Mar 31 2024,positive,omg i love the movie ima a big fan of king kong and  it was actions and funny moments throughout the movie to see the them team up together it was exciting to me i saw it in digital 3d and it was dope to see it like that it was well worth the  money
Mar 31 2024,positive,godzilla x kong is a thrilling entertaining and awesome movie that shows how godzilla can be both goofy and serious i recommend any monster movie fan to watch this movie
Mar 31 2024,positive,went to see it with the family awesome movie  the family loved it the monsters had more screen time which lead to epic fight scenes the movie did not have too much drama which was in my opinion better because it led to less awkward emotional scenes best movie so far of this year looking forward to the next one
Mar 31 2024,positive,an awesome addition to the monster universe a must see on the big screen
Mar 31 2024,positive,very entertaining and great what i recommend is watching it in 4dx  3d
Mar 31 2024,positive,it was nonstop fun
Mar 31 2024,positive,critic reviews are laughable its a giant monster movie that scratches the itch it needs giant monster fighting giant monsters there does not need to be some grand plot line but there is still a story and its funny to watch kong try to be nice to godzilla
Mar 31 2024,positive,the movie was amazing probably the best of the monsterverse i super recommend whatcing it
Mar 31 2024,positive,better than an orgasam
Mar 31 2024,positive,we loved everything about this movie i was actually sitting at the edge of my seat cant wait to see it again
Mar 31 2024,positive,so freaking good loved this movie great to see a showa style godzilla movie again  you want a human driven godzilla flick with a heartfelt story then see godzilla minus one you want an old school godzilla movie driven by the monsters and has amazing kaiju battles this is the movie for you
Mar 31 2024,positive,fast pacing always something about to happen on each of the different plot lines  minimized silly human sublots lots of monster time  the final battle was off the hook mayhem  take note hollywood more of this less of the acolyte
Mar 31 2024,positive,the movie is ridiculous and packed with cringe inducing moments with the human characters  however it was also packed with nonstop monster action  as nonstop as a movie can be  for that the movie gets a passable 3 stars    watched this in the 4dx experience with my son  that experience earns a 4 stars as it became a universal studios ride for 2 hours  overall balances out to 35 stars for me
Mar 31 2024,positive,id have to give it 5 stars for all of the battle scenes between king kong and godzilla and actually not a bad storyline
Mar 31 2024,neutral,great for children with a fairy talegood feeling ending definitely catered to the tiktok brain pretty predictable yet convoluted and seems like they jammed a whole lot of substance less content in a shorter movie easily the worst godzilla and kong movie produced to date save your 
Mar 31 2024,positive,great story i loved how they connected all the movies
Mar 31 2024,positive,the visual effects are spectacular the sound is awesome and finally a kaiju movie that concentrates on the kaiju
Mar 31 2024,positive,go watch this movie im a huge godzilla fan and even if kong was the hero of the movie i really enjoyed it no stupid human characters just great action
Mar 31 2024,positive,great movie  stayed action packed and the plot had a lot of substance
Mar 31 2024,positive,it was an amazing movie i genuinely cant think of much ill things to say about it at worst the characters werent anything special but they were by no means bad and the jokes were pretty funny and in a few scenes the cgi was a little wonky    thats pretty much it the cgi was pretty damn good for every other part of the movie the humans were again not that bad and the story was decent but the monster action it was peak action the fights were super well done and very entertaining and me and my buds all enjoyed it
Mar 31 2024,positive,the movie was full excitement lots of action and the sound  special effects were pure genius
Mar 31 2024,positive,so this movie had some problems but it was mostly a good time kong was great in this movie the action was incredible even though im a hard core kong fan i cant deny that godzilla was a powerhouse also the humans were good what i liked the mother daughter relationship with gia but the villans      were introduced way too late in the film and the final battle should have been longer i felt like the film was a bit rushed its a fun time
Mar 31 2024,positive,honestly was such a fun movie i enjoyed the huge monster fights and the human plotline was minimal and worked great critics need too quit trippin films a masterpiece
Mar 31 2024,positive,godzilla is a beast in this one worth the watch just to see him plough through all the monsters
Mar 31 2024,positive,exceeded my high expectations  exciting funny  great time at the movies with friends
Mar 31 2024,positive,very entertaining to watch
Mar 31 2024,positive,i drank a 32oz beer during the movie and was falling asleep halfway through but just couldnt get into it the funny stuff just seemed a little lame and the sound would have probably been great if it wasnt too low in the theater paid extra for atmos and the atmos demo was amazing but movie started and blah i think that kinda ruined it for me
Mar 31 2024,positive,after godzilla vs kong and monarch i had very low expectations coming into this film i will admit though i was pleasantly surprised the entire time it was not perfect and some things were a little overly cheesy but it somehow finds a way to own that cheesiness they promise giant kaiju fights and they deliver i think the critic reviews are a bit dramatic
Mar 31 2024,positive,the stars of kaiju films are the kaiju a good godzilla film tells its story through the monsters with the human aspect being secondary the critics who are slamming this film clearly have no clue as to fan expectations
Mar 31 2024,positive,the movie was phenomenal best out the monster verse yet
Mar 31 2024,positive,best buddy cop picture since  lethal weapon
Mar 31 2024,positive,i really enjoyed the movie great fights the cgi could be a bit better and i wish the blood was red but thats really the biggest gripes i have with it nice to see mothra but it really is obvious that she wasnt originally meant to be in the movie it was very ooc for her not to help goji the stakes were pretty low it didnt feel like godzilla had any problems mothra could just sacrifice herself again for a burning godzilla to incinerate skars entire army i did like the movie though and i want the monsterverse to continueeven if i only highlighted what i didnt like im a massive goji fan so it was a good movie to me bye
Mar 31 2024,positive,story was a mix bag human story was weak godzilla slept for most of it so its manily a kong story he just needs godzillas help
Mar 31 2024,positive,the movie was great i always was wondering how tiamat was going to look like and godzilla was more powerful than usual and the fights were really good as well but the only con was the monsters look small in the hallow earth but this movie in my opinion is a solid 8210
Mar 31 2024,positive,loved loved loved it action through out must see in imax go see it
Mar 31 2024,positive,this film succeeds in setting out to what it promised to do give fans of the genre that grew up watching the monster battle royales of the 60s  70s showa era an epic rumble in solid cgi the human characters are trimmed down but do their part of getting the exposition out of the way no matter how nonsensical  ridiculous the monstertitan emotions conveyed in different scenes were also impressive bottom line this is not godzilla 10 this is just fun giant monsters fighting and it was a lot of fun to watch
Mar 31 2024,positive,the movie was perfect the jokes where good i liked all the characters my only complaint is that the fight scenes felt a bit short but it is definitely the best monsterverse movie so far
Mar 31 2024,positive,by far the craziest and best movie of this year for me battles delivered the best thrills and adorable wholesome moments by far one of my favorite monsterverse movies
Mar 31 2024,positive,what a sequel the titans showed up and delivered a frenzy of battles which had the audience clapping as the credits rolled up i liked the storyline and it did do justice to the ever awesome godzilla the way godzilla is portrayed and his sheer power was legendary i thought the pink may diminish himi was wrong i also appreciated the kept secret of mothra the appearance of her just boosted the movie even more  criticismsthe graphics did fade in places and i also felt that they could have had more godzilla screen time lastly have they shrunk godzilla more    overall definitely worth another visit to the cinema its been a long time since i last applauded a movie welldone 
Mar 31 2024,positive,the movie is amazing kong has more time on the screen i hope a sequence that focus on godzilla
Mar 31 2024,positive,i dont watch these movie to see an oscar winning performance i watch them to be entertained i really enjoyed this film
Mar 31 2024,positive,very entertaining from start to finish i dont mind their not being much depth to the plot because the visual effects were so dazzling to see on an imax screen
Mar 31 2024,negative,i love godzilla plus one this was landed lost meats pikachu it was absolute garbage so disappointing in this absolute mess of a movie
Mar 31 2024,positive,the most titan fun ive had in a while so many action scenes with just monsters and no humans involved
Mar 31 2024,positive,a movie to just go to theater and have fun not a 1010 but fulfills my needs
Mar 31 2024,positive,movie is awesome its a kong movie he showcases a lot without any words
Mar 31 2024,positive,this movie was big loud obnoxious predictable and corny and i loved every minute of it
Mar 31 2024,positive,this movie was great everything about it was amazing and the events corresponded very well i just wish it was more difficult for kong and his allies overall great movie
Mar 31 2024,positive,i loved the movie it was amazing and it was good tha there was not to much human stuff witch i like cs it is abt godzilla and kong and the kaiju tha im there for it was a amazing movie i recommed
Mar 31 2024,positive,this good movie but last fight is so short next movie i hope to see more fight
Mar 31 2024,negative,gxk was not my favorite movie now as a stand alone title it was pretty good and as a sequel to gvk it was also decent but my problem with it was how it completely teared down what the franchise had built why did godzilla kill scylla or tiamat when he has already shown numerous times that he is dominant over them and could have just roared at them to tell them both to leave sidenotewhy did godzilla care that scylla was awake he didnt care that tiamat clearly was before so then why did he now scylla showed no sign of challenging godzillas dominance over the titans as all he did was run at her and wasted his time and energy when again he could just said bow and been done with it then tiamat if your gonna acknowledge the existence of tiamat them why did she attack godzilla why didnt godzilla already have her hideout if he wanted it that bad i understand it was for shimo but there was no power gap at all between him vs shimo and gvk last thing mothra did adam wingard even watch kotm i understand that she laid an egg but that was no egg she just popped in like she was summoned as if shes a god from absolutely nothing someone told me that it was her spirit and if this percents as true then this is again completely disregarding everything that has already been built upon by previous installments    ps if your gonna make a movie in a franchise keep it consistent dont just throw it away the second you think just a giant monster mash with inexplicable messes and cameos is the most entertaining thing for people with the attention span of a goldfish
Mar 31 2024,positive,great movie of monster mayhem just what i expected needed more monster fights and it delivered
Mar 31 2024,positive,it was exactly what youd expect in this kind of movie and im so happy kong got to be featured in a film hes my favorite
Mar 31 2024,positive,the movie was pretty cool i liked it  i only wish the final battle wouldve been dragged along a little bit longer cuz i feel they beat up sk too fast but it was still pretty awesome   that entrance of godzilla and kong into hollow earth was freaking epic
Mar 31 2024,positive,if u are a true godzilla and think outside the box on stuff this is a great addition to the godzilla  kong franchise if u think this movie is to campy for godzilla then u havent seen any other godzilla filmin the last 70 years i loved loved it cant wait for more
Mar 31 2024,positive,a lot of goofy fun the sections with godzilla were better than any other part of the   movie    a big problem was that there is little to no sense of scale in the hollow earth
Mar 31 2024,positive,so the critics say come to godzilla x kong the new empire for the sheer monstermashing spectacle  and stay for that too because the movie doesnt have much else to offer thats like reviewing a sports movie and saying enjoy the athletes because this movie doesnt have much else to offer as far as the new line of godzillakong movies go this is nearly the best id rank king of all monsters as the best in the series this film is great the critics are just lost outside of its context and i can guarantee as a godzillakong fan youll feel the same easily a 45 out of 5 on the godzilla scale
Mar 31 2024,positive,spell binding  knowing your kong and godzilla movies is a must as it starts with the past
Mar 31 2024,positive,lots of monster fight scenes worth watching it again for me
Mar 31 2024,positive,the critics are so non enjoyment always wanting the notebook this is godzilla and kong shutup and enjoy the most enjoyable blockbuster movie of the year
Mar 31 2024,positive,big fan of this series and this one totally has a retro feel to it gives good 80s like vibes total fun
Mar 31 2024,neutral,so many things wrong with the film from the title the human plot mothra and the titans and the odd pacing for scenes adam wingard direction a second time just isnt it especially with a script like this one
Mar 31 2024,positive,monster mania you go to a monster movie to see monsters fight this did exactly that if you want a human story with drama maybe go watch a drama movie about humans
Mar 31 2024,positive,less time wasted and more titankaiju action
Mar 31 2024,positive,so lets start with the good lots of monster screen time godzilla being a giant cat some cute visuals cool set pieces and concepts the bad human cast  we are gonna take the least interesting case members from the last movie which were on completely different human plots and didnt even really meet and have them be the leads with super dentist too be fair super dentist was at least fun probably the worst way to bring back mothra just for the human to have a purpose  the monster interaction from kong doing his best god of war impressions to godzilla basically having two brain cells this movie   if you are here to have fun watching monster fight its gonna get the job done if you at all care about lore and the over arching story of the monsterverse well at least it was fun
Mar 31 2024,positive,the new rivals introduced and a storyline that sets up more sequels to come
Mar 31 2024,negative,absolute the worst movie of the year the budget must have went to the actors because the cgi and writing are absolutely terrible
Mar 31 2024,positive,sometimes you want to go to the movies to enjoy  and this film has given me that and more  is it a masterpiece no  we care  no  we love her yeah  monsters fighting and mass destructiongive me more
Mar 31 2024,positive,i am a lifelong kaiju fan of 40 years i got everything i wanted in a monster movie i took my 6yearold and we had a blast i cant wait for the next one
Mar 31 2024,positive,really good movie had a good time watching it but just wish they had more fighting scenes with the monsters
Mar 31 2024,positive,i went in with low expectations and was shocked by how much i loved it i will definitely watch it again
Mar 31 2024,positive,the first hour of the movie is just weird but as soon as they introduse the new villian it immedietly becomes 20x better i love the second half but i cant give it any higher  than a 710
Mar 31 2024,positive,once again the audience is correct
Mar 31 2024,positive,it was good fun the action scenes were nice
Mar 31 2024,positive,in this colossal clash of titans godzilla vs kong the new empire delivers jawdropping visual effects vfx and a straightforward storyline the battles between these iconic monsters are aweinspiring but the film lacks the depth and intricate plots of its classic predecessors grab your popcorn suspend disbelief and enjoy the epic showdown 
Mar 31 2024,positive,it was a great movie kong and godzilla were great the fights great the way they can convey a conversation with no words was amazing i will say normally 9 out of 10 times when i watch these movies the human plot is the worst part and just gets in the way of why i am really watching the movie but this time the plot at least made a genuine effort and tied in to the monsters without feeling forced it still was the worst part of the plot but it was way better than others i have seen
Mar 31 2024,positive,kongs story throughout the movie was told with such beautiful visual story telling the expressiveness of the titans and visuals go hand in hand in telling such a beautiful kaiju story godzilla was badass as always
Mar 31 2024,positive,the movie is loud silly colorful and dumb  and all in an awesome fun way  i had a blast watching this film  the film is not going to win any oscar award but it will keep the entertain throughout the film  provided you are into these kinds of film  this is not godzilla minus one  the storyline is simple the characters are not very developed but the kaijutitans actions is what were here for  kong is the central character and godzilla is secondary in this film  but godzilla has his shining moments also  the main villain is a dictator tag team wwe style romp fest for the final act  and this films gives you that   by watching the trailers and tv spots you should know what youre walking into  the film is aimed towards a more younger audiences and the kids in my theater was eating up every moment of it  just walk into the theater dont expect too much and youll leave satisfied for the ticket price
Mar 31 2024,positive,legendary stays with the wins gxk is the biggest movie of the year one of the greatest the only competition it has in either respect is dune 2 which is also made by legendary
Mar 31 2024,positive,i just watched this its pretty mid honestly gvk is better but this is better than kotm the ending looks like its rushed and how tf did they made the beast glove so fast
Mar 31 2024,positive,it was ok nothing special kinda disappointed but it was just meh wish godzilla was more op
Mar 31 2024,positive,if youre a godzilla fan youre gonna love it seeing your favorite kaiju go crazy on his enemies and overpowering pretty much anything is awesome reminding you about why he is the king of the monsters  this entry feels like how the first avengers movie felt in a good way i just hope they give godzilla more protagonism in the future
Mar 31 2024,positive,i didnt like how mothra was portrayed
Mar 31 2024,positive,this is a very well paced movie peoples real lives are bad enough i dont have to think about anything i just wanted to watch monsters fight for two hours the only drawback is that there are so few godzilla scenesand rip tiamat tat
Mar 31 2024,positive,loved everything about this movie  i would go see it again
Mar 31 2024,positive,fantastic movie best in the monsterverse 1010
Mar 31 2024,positive,this movie was amazing it was fun and just super good in my opinion i would go watch it again
Mar 31 2024,positive,loved this film plenty of mister actuon great character depth for kong and really toned down on the human drama loved it
Mar 31 2024,positive,go watch this with some buddies or just alone its a fun movie with giant monsters exactly how its advertised
Mar 31 2024,positive,very entertaining movie
Mar 31 2024,negative,what was the point of this film after a while i got bored with all the cgi there was really no story i found it really crude to see kong and little kong eating the intestines of their prey as in almost every film like this there is a young girl that saves the day what about the young boys i must admit that the film was beautiful to look at but that was about it for me i missed alexander skaarsgard from the last film
Mar 31 2024,positive,from action comedy and best of all the monsters this was an amazing movie definitely worth a second watch
Mar 31 2024,positive,the monsterverse is headed into a fun direction with its titans my hope is that the great character building doing on the monarch series can catch up to the movies because the human element of these movies has decline with this one in a huge way
Mar 31 2024,positive,good in action but the storyline was a bit confused
Mar 31 2024,negative,the kind of movie that leaves you feeling dumber after watching terrible writing annoying characters utterly forgettable skip this trash and see godzilla minus one which is infinitely better
Mar 31 2024,negative,movie was absolutely horrible
Mar 31 2024,positive,love it ima have to watch it again
Mar 31 2024,positive,great movie spoiler alert the tag team duo to show how kong and godzilla had settled their differences in the moment to take down a much bigger threat was a really inspiring moment in the movie and gives you a badass feeling inside 1010 i would see it again
Mar 31 2024,positive,the story is pretty much generic but the cgi and monster battles are the most epic thing in the universe history the humans are not so boring now but there a lot of things in this movie that dont have a lot do with kong and godzilla and the film editing and the pacing is tremendously awful 5 min of the movie is low paced and 10 min after is super rock fast paced the final battle was like only 1 min so disappointing watch better godzilla minus one the best rated godzilla movie
Mar 31 2024,positive,spoilers overall the movie was great the only problems i have with it is the animation of godzilla  scylla as they felt like they had no weight to their movements and the short screen time of tiamat as that would have been a really cool fight scene as it was shown as one of the big teased monsters for the future to then only have about a minute or 2 of screen time before being killed
Mar 31 2024,positive,focusing on the monsters rather than the humans was a great choice  i was thoroughly entertained
Mar 31 2024,negative,i found very little to like about this film this is horribly directed written and acted music sounds like it should have been in a b movie songs was out of place and badly chosen the story of mothra in king of the monsters had the twins setup for their return this totally changed that the little girl not only controls the giant ape with sign language she now brings mothra back her adoptive mother played by rebecca hall has gotten her haircut and it looks awful i know that sounds picky but it hurts her character the monster kong and godzilla have to fight is another ape who has another monster that he rides and controls with evidently a crystal that monster supposedly brought on the ice age and he looks like a pokemon character more than a monster the major fight scene has them floating in zero gravity im not lying and they just happen to have made kong a guantlet that they put on him when he hurts his hand kyle chandler alexander skarsgard and millie bobby browns characters are unfortunately not in this film they probably read the script and decided this would hurt their careers i was worried after seeing the preview that this film was going to be a disappointment its worse than that kids will probably enjoy it the bad cgi and pokémon monster had me thinking this should have been animated godzilla minus one is so much better than this that i hate to compare them the 90s godzilla with matthew broderick is better than this this film is more about kong than godzilla and maybe they should have left godzilla out of it if they make another film please take your time with the script and dont bring wingard back to direct it at this point i think they should just not make anymore i cant even recommend watching this on home video watch sharknado its better
Mar 31 2024,positive,this movie was a massive improvement from the last one there was less human drama and more about the creatures which is what most fans really want the movie was mainly about the creatures interacting with each other and less about the humans the fights in this movie were also really good especially the kong fights the cgi and effects were also really cool and i like the new godzilla design the only recurring issue with these movies is that the mainly focus on kong but they dialed it back on this movie it was more even between focus in my opinion
Mar 31 2024,positive,this movie was everything a monsterverse fan will want its mostly from kongs pov but it builds a nice story fight scenes are awesome and the human interaction was just enough to want to see their part of the story i will add it did feel rushed like it could have ran ½ longer im sure the big dogs interfered with the direction and had wingard shorten his version loved it
Mar 31 2024,positive,i really enjoyed this movie its very reminiscent of those older cheesy kaiju movies and thats why i love it because those older movies have a charm if youre a kaiju movie fan this shouldnt disappoint one thing i personally want though is more human arcs i know a lot of people dont like it but the older films have it and its good story telling to build up to the monster fights
Mar 31 2024,positive,amazing visuals with non stop action this is the best godzilla movie in years and full of fun for the whole ride must see in theaters king kong gets to really shine as well with the team up
Mar 31 2024,positive,movie is so fun to watch loved the expansion of the monsterverse that dive deep into the hollow earth and the focus centered on kong hope in next sequels they give equal priority to godzilla do not miss the theatre experience
Mar 31 2024,positive,as a huge monsterverse  godzilla fan this movie exceeded my expectations and was more than what i hoped for loved it perfect 1010 amazing movie all the kaiju fight scenes were incredible
Mar 31 2024,positive,a lot of fighting did not i repeat did not got bored ones
Mar 31 2024,positive,if you are a fan of the monsterverse you will definitely enjoy the film needed more of godzilla the story moves very fast so get ready 
Mar 31 2024,positive,im 75 years old godzilla fan went to watch this movie with my grandson who was super excited to watch this after all the chaos settled down we came out of the theatre my little one was jumping with joy and never stopped talking about it so it is an easy 5star for me im planning to take him one more time to watch this and this time it will be a surprise for him
Mar 31 2024,positive,no way can anyone not see this movie and rate it poorly if youre a fan of either godzilla or kong the battle sequences were the best yet and the added emotional human element to the film made it surpass every other godzilla or kong movie from this universe yet
Mar 31 2024,positive,godzilla and kong killing other monsters whats not to love
Mar 31 2024,positive,really liked it the story was interesting if youre a kong fan and hope theres at least one more movie that will be shocking an epic
Mar 31 2024,positive,this movie is so cool i like when godzilla kills tiamat it was sooo epik
Mar 31 2024,positive,i wasnt expecting much if anything i expected to be disappointed but my kids wanted to watch the movie so i took them to the theaters and i was hoping i fell sleep to my surprise the movie kept me awake the entire time the only small issue that i had was that the boss fight ended up pretty quickly
Mar 31 2024,positive,a cinematic masterpiece that truly needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible this movie is exactly what i wanted from it kong and suko were awesome together i thought skar king was actually the best villain in the monsterverse and he was super menacing was godzilla was more of a cameo but to be honest i am as much of a kong fan as a godzilla fan but i still feel like they did my main man g a little dirty the human characters are surprisingly funny and bearable the battles were beautiful i was jumping up and down in my seat the entire time once i walked out of that imax theater i was like that was awesome overall i absolutely loved this film i really think the monsterverse is heading in the right direction 9510 might even be better than minus one hey i grew up with the showa era
Mar 31 2024,positive,i loved it action packed
Mar 31 2024,positive,we enjoyed the movie great entertainment
Mar 31 2024,positive,not every movie needs a deep and moving storyline pure fun no deep thoughts necessary it is exactly what its trying to be and doesnt need to be any more than that
Mar 31 2024,positive,loved the movie kong was great
Mar 31 2024,positive,its very funny and liked the kaijus that were in there my fav part was the final battle 
Mar 31 2024,positive,great movie with lots of action
Mar 31 2024,positive,story felt rushed but the kaiju battles were awesome
Mar 31 2024,positive,the film delivered exactly what audiences wanted  we can get all the horror and drama from the recent 1 japanese iteration no need to compare it with what this franchise is going for  this one is all about the kaijus punching each other in the face a spectacle of colourful lasers electricity and explosions  leave your brain at home and have fun
Mar 31 2024,positive,soo much fun   was so into it 
Mar 31 2024,positive,the best action movie so far nonstop monster fighting action and a lot of beautiful scene cant get enough of godzilla and kong plus a mini hint of jet jaguar i guess is exciting
Mar 31 2024,positive,this is easily the most monster focused monster movie most godzilla movies have 90 minutes of human drama and 1020 minutes of godzilla and this movie does away with that no one watches godzilla movies to see humans talking more of this formula please
Mar 31 2024,negative,my opinion this point movie godzilla x kong the new empire narrative action the cinematographic object of this creativity is strangely different the fans always win godzilla inequality it seems that things have little to fight powerful discrimination so weak kong    original main purpose of the film in 1933 king kong in yours american and what happened movies written review director adam title change the name of him can do it first kong x second godzilla last 2021 unfair inequality godzilla vs kong    the plot of king kong vs godzilla 1962 in this important story the constructive process creativity is positively remade we will also fight hard    we actually make future movies titled king kong vs godzilla    my honest truth is that and i want them to change the name title kong x godzilla kxg
Mar 31 2024,positive,i loved this movie as a godzilla and kong fan i couldnt wait to see it and it didnt disappoint love how they give the back story of kong and how godzilla is a big part of his story i love monster movies so if you mobster movies this is a must see
Mar 31 2024,positive,the movie was great and enjoyable  me and my family really enjoyed it  if anybody wants to get out of boredom and have fun this movie is perfect for you
Mar 31 2024,positive,great movie for the action sequences and some ok comedy but story not really i expected more out of the movie in terms of villain but i didnt sense much danger in scar king compared to other kaijus in monster verse overall i dont think miss out in much if you wait to see it for home release
Mar 31 2024,positive,i saw the movie yesterday and imo  the movie was fantastic it was fun campy at times and the special effects were amazing dont miss out seeing this on the big screen
Mar 31 2024,positive,freaking loves it less human thoughplease
Mar 31 2024,positive,nice choice to watch d box and 3d makes an unforgettable experience full of action and tense moments
Mar 31 2024,negative,its entertaining but not worth paying to see acting is garbage plot is completely predictable  unless you are completely into this genre i would wait to see it for free on tv
Mar 31 2024,negative,way too much kong thats it this movie would be 5 stars if it was just godzilla kong sucks he can never beat any real titan one on one the amount of time spent going through kongs journey is such a waste of time instead of him searching for a noisy frog we couldve had at least a 2min longer godzilla fight vs tiamat or scylia its just so dumb stop putting kong in godzilla movies cause he ruins it with being an awful kiju hes not a traditional kiju has no powers and constantly depends on human help or stupid tricks like throwing sand to have him fight other titans to even be able to complete why are we entertaining this if you want to make another lame kong movie just do that you can make it all about the  hollow earth that no one cares about and then all the loser people who like kong and think he deserves this amount of screen time for some reason can go cream over that garbage we want a real godzilla movie ill say it again get rid of lame ape kong and give us a real godzilla movie you call this a godzilla movie to get the massive fan base that he has to come watch and then slap that community in the face with pathetic screen time and off screen titan kills we want to see godzilla fight the titans thats all no one cares about kong if youre a real godzilla fan you might want to pass this movie will be disappointing to any true fan because it is a kong movie
Mar 31 2024,positive,the movie was fun kind of seem like there was a lot of fantasy but it was enjoyable
Mar 31 2024,positive,movie was everything i hoped for just non stop action girlfriend said its the best movie she has ever watched
Mar 31 2024,positive,as usual critics and kaiju fans are just two different animals this movie is incredibly fun and doesnt take itself seriously it has the feel of a saturday morning cartoon and it is not afraid to admit it does it have the depth and gravity of something like godzilla minus one nope but does it need to nope legendary is doing their own thing with the monsterverse and i am here for it    enjoyable from start to finish and delivers on the monster action we know and love and this time the humans barely even get in the way of the real stars
Mar 31 2024,positive,i love it im a fan of godzilla and kong great movie 
Mar 31 2024,positive,i was somewhat disappointed  the buildup of the scar king as a major villain in promos was much overdone  he and his icezilla didnt look to pose any unprecedented threat to the upper world and even together they were not even close to a match for the big g and bionic kong  also im seeing some of the plot elements in this new series of movies that i disliked in the older toho films when they spent too much time concentrating on secondary characters and secondary or even tertiary plots when they could and should have given audiences more particulars about the stars the kaiju
Mar 31 2024,positive,awesome kaiju film my least favorite in the monsterverse but a great time nonetheless
Mar 31 2024,positive,i think this will be one of those movies that will go down as one that is considered a comedy even though the makers of the movie did not want it to be a comedy lot of laughs in the theater which i dont think were intended
Mar 31 2024,positive,as usual ignore the critics i promise if youre even slightly interested in the monster verse you will enjoy the movie some of the best fight scenes theyve produced  the characters and storyline are still there enough to keep you engaged in the human side of things throughly enjoyed it from start to finish and will probably go watch it again on imax
Mar 31 2024,positive,great movie though i feel it was more jong than godzilla
Mar 31 2024,positive,love this movie im so glad they made the human so insignificant this is what you really want to see in the godzilla movie less humans more monsters fighting
Mar 31 2024,positive,it was an excellent movie with a ton of monster action while giving kong a great deal of personality in this one very well done
Mar 31 2024,positive,this is true peak fiction and certified kino
Mar 31 2024,positive,went on a solo date to see this last night and im glad i didit was good action from start to finish must see
Mar 31 2024,positive,fantastic thrill ride i loved king kong in this film riding high on the monster verse
Mar 31 2024,positive,so much aura so much sauce this is absolutely unbelievable this is ridiculous adam wingard how did you do this you might actually be the goat
Mar 31 2024,positive,this is a non stop actionpacked adventure when i saw the first godzilla and kong skull island i luved them both but the next two movies were utterly trash story acting etc but i had hopes that adam wingard w9ould breath new life into this franchise and he did not disappoint it truly felt like there was always something to see feel  experience while watching this movie    i was very happy that the cast was more limited this time and that the acting was top notch no more goofy and stupid dialog each character roles was essential and integrated into the story the exception is brian who absolutely adds no value to the franchise and should forever be dropped    for the visuals just superb you can clearly see how animation has evolved for the last 10 years adams choice to give the creatures especially kong more human expression was a bold choice and it paid off connecting the animals to the audience giving the kong the glovei see why they did it and not sure i agree but at least it wasnt this overly glorified gauntlet     the pacing was amazing as good as the hobbit and similar movies adam keep me in my seat even past the point where i really needed a bio break im truly looking for to his next film
Mar 31 2024,positive,seen it yesterday and i must say great movie 
Mar 31 2024,positive,godzilla x kong the new empire is an epic visual action spectacle that delivers bonkers escapism
Mar 31 2024,positive,this movie is incredible i watched it with my friend and my dad insannneee 1010 100 recommend
Mar 31 2024,positive,great for the spectacle story a little less so
Mar 31 2024,positive,i really enjoyed this movie if you are a monster verse fan and dont expect a godzilla minus one movie youll enjoy it
Mar 31 2024,positive,great movie lots of action
Mar 31 2024,positive,10 out of 10 i would go see it for a second time
Mar 31 2024,positive,highly entertaining actionpacked movie with a decent story line considering the main characters are a giant gorilla and an equally massive radioactive lizard
Mar 31 2024,positive,when i was a kid i used to stay up late to watch godzilla vs anything on late night cable having seen all the godzilla movies over the years this was a fantastic creature feature brawl with a great finale definitely not as serious as godzilla minus one but a great popcorn flick for a night out at the movies
Mar 31 2024,positive,the truth is that i loved the movie i saw it in 3d and i can say that the good thing is that there was not so much human interaction and they dedicated it more to the monsters apart from the fact that there are many kaijus like shimo suko skarking tiamat godzilla kong mothra warbats and other types of monsters without a doubt it is my top 2 i recommend seeing it its not perfect but it is great
Mar 31 2024,positive,enjoyed this film in imax  very well done with much much more titan time they make kong more human and more intelligent loved all the fights and new titans altogether a very very well done agitan flick highly recommend
Mar 31 2024,positive,absolutely had a blast in theaters with this movieim a godzilla fan and the downsides for me with this movie is that godzilla has so little screen time considering hes the first name in this movie title and the cgi is sometimes a bit bad but thats just the only downsides i have and i love how the apes without talking just have so much emotion that you can tell what they feel like and i like how menacing skar king is in this movie even killing sukos friend or a family member of his and the best parts is when kong used suko as a weapon and godzilla suplexing kong wwe style and i was laughing on what adam wingard put on this and my thoughts on shimo is shes just cute and sweet and just wants be free from skar kingi like how kong is just petting shimo like a dog at the endand suko is just cute and aggressive and so durable that he can be used as a weaponwhen watching this make sure its imax so you can see it to the biggest screen and 3d
Mar 31 2024,positive,what a movie   dont waste your time in reading this reviews  pure massy cinema only that human being creating that own logic about telepathy and antigravity whatever bullshit aside the climax is pure gold 
Mar 31 2024,positive,entertaining and fun movie in the classic godzilla style wont win an oscar but who cares storyline was fine and almost complete leaves a couple of unanswered questions will watch again for sure
Mar 31 2024,positive,this movie was so much fun prolly the most fun ive had in a theater this year so far godzilla being a godly force was awesome and kong just being the top dog loved it
Mar 31 2024,positive,the movie itself was good yes i would tell others to watch it however i would not see it for the second time
Mar 31 2024,positive,love it will see again
Mar 31 2024,positive,i loved this movie even though it ranks in the top 4th in my monsterverse rankings the human characters werent as bad in this movie but some of the self commentary was a bit annoying at times but the main kaiju action was amazing throughout the movie and following kong is fun even the scenes without dialog because of the facial expressions shown this movie could have used a bit more godzilla but i cannot complain since it feels like kong is the main character of the monsterverse the main villain the scar king was good in my opinion and shimu lacked a bit of thinking about the threat that she could potentially cause with her abilities
Mar 31 2024,positive,its a little too long fight scenes a little disjointed but its still a really fun time go see it in imax
Mar 31 2024,positive,big dumb and most importantly fun just the way it should be my 7 year old and i were laughing and grinning like idiots for the entire movie will buy it and watch it a ton at home go see it on a big screen with big sound 
Mar 31 2024,positive,its more godzilla and kong enjoyable monster action and fighting it is a bit slow with the mother and daughter issues in the beginning but it fixes itself at the end
Mar 31 2024,positive,the critics are not watching the same movie because this was filled with great cgi action packed fight scenes and it is overall an amazing addition to the monsterverse
Mar 31 2024,positive,best kaiju movie of all time there were a perfect amount of screen time for the kaijus and the characters are very lovable  the fight scenes were amazing the plot is great and the movie is hilarious
Mar 31 2024,neutral,i only enjoyed the little baby kong and his reactions and interactions with kong those were priceless  otherwise the storyline was lame
Mar 31 2024,positive,another monsterverse movie that made me forget what i was sad about cool new villains more world building and a lot of great character animation with the monsters mothra better be getting her own solo film next
Mar 31 2024,positive,i dont care what critics say this is a good movie to see  the action was enough to make me lose track of time  i had no clue it was about 2 12 hours  the body of godzilla in the trailers is explained it is overall a great watch
Mar 31 2024,positive,really enjoyed this movie me and the wife plenty of action expense kept me ready for more
Mar 31 2024,positive,this movie was great of course the critics say the movie is bad when its the complete opposite this movie is what these monster movies should be like moving forward straight monster action and not having just one big fight at the end instead multiple fights with different titans to show us why they are so powerful instead of characters who hold no weight saying it i for one believe less character roles the better the monster films will do
Mar 31 2024,positive,good popcorn movie with the family
Mar 31 2024,positive,its nothing ground breaking it is a true monster film meant for people to relax and have fun with with stunning cgi and a lot of screentime with our favorite kaijus it makes this film a must watch
Mar 31 2024,positive,great time if youre a monsterverse fan for the sheer visual experience of these titans then youre in for a treat the characters involved in this film are fun to engage and the shocking discoveries in hollow earth were unexpected the one thing that caught me by surprise was the fact this entire time i expected the main villain to tower over kong from the commercials but they stood equal overall my kids and i loved the film kong forever
Mar 31 2024,positive,fun action movie turn off your brain and ignore any deep thoughts know what youre paying for go imax
Mar 31 2024,positive,best monsterverse movie yet in my opinion action packed and beautiful to watch
Mar 31 2024,positive,i had a smile from minute 1 until the very end  ive been a godzilla fan since the first godzilla movie i was exposed to in the early 70s  this movie is exactly what it is supposed to be  an all out monster fest  love that kong has evolved his movements and facial expressions communicate much better than some actors nowadays can do with a real voice  godzilla is amazing as usual  obviously not a film for critics but for this fan i left happy and satisfied
Mar 31 2024,positive,absolutely an awesome movie to watch we had a family night out to the movies and all 7 of us raved about the movie
Mar 31 2024,positive,it was great and i love it  but i  feel like they cut some scenes like when the he flight with the water monster
Mar 31 2024,positive,loved it good story and great effects
Mar 31 2024,positive,honestly surprised  movie has its issues with some plot issues but overall it was a fun movie to watch  definitely better than the previous godzilla vs kong
Mar 31 2024,positive,thrill ride start to finish
Mar 31 2024,positive,i thought it was great beautiful visuals with a lot of amazing kaiju fighting and a little bit of heart and a lot of fun is what made this a great kaiju movie my only critiques were it couldve been 2030 min longer to flesh out the story a little bit more and not having enough godzilla in it which i understand this is truly kongs movie but when its titled godzilla x kong you expect to have an equal amount of screen time for both characters which godzilla maybe had 810 min of screen time total plus anytime godzilla showed up on screen it made the movie even better especially showing all his new powers and how powerful he truly is hes literally the king of monsters i get godzilla minus one just came out which was an amazing movie and had a lot of godzilla in it but it just seems like the people behind the scenes were just like oh we dont need to show a lot of godzilla since he just had his own moviewhich is what it felt like imo which by the way do not try and compare these 2 movies cause theyre both completely different movies also whose bright idea was it to give rebecca hall a bowl cut like come on really that has to be in the top 10 worse haircuts of all time in a movie 
Mar 31 2024,positive,overall a great movie it was absolute worth the wait it was action packed and great story telling we finally got too see some other titans i was blown away at the movie theaters its has emotion and action in it really good movie
Mar 31 2024,positive,superb movie with cool action and humour
Mar 31 2024,positive,i was blown away by some of the scenes in this movie my personal favourite form this franchise the music was great the technology was interesting to think about and the story for kong was brilliant highly recommend if you liked the previous instalment
Mar 31 2024,positive,yall freakin weirdo comparing this movie with godzilla minus one
Mar 31 2024,negative,probably the shortest screen time of godzilla yet in this series shots were poor and too jarring 3d was the worst experience double images were noticeable throughout the movie and many out of focus shots being a huge blur there were some fights that were good so definitely a movie to still see if you enjoy monster mashes i love these types of movies but its pretty much kong new empire with guest appearance of godzilla until final fight godzilla shots lasted about 5 seconds reminding me of the lack of godzilla from this series first entry back in 2014
Mar 31 2024,positive,entertaining fight of monsters and lots of apes and excellent cgi
Mar 31 2024,positive,amazing action packed through the whole movie so many monster fights
Mar 31 2024,positive,very good movie and full of emotions
Mar 31 2024,positive,i went to see  gvk the new empire  friday night expecting to just have a night of monster madness i got more than i expected  many additional kaiju limited human interaction and long fun monsters fighting  sure not everyones cup of tea but i left with a smile on my face and a plethora of ideas for the next movie in the monsterverse franchise just go spend 2 hours of monster fun folks money well spent
Mar 31 2024,positive,ive been a fan since 1970 and have watched all 38 godzilla movies this latest entry is awesome they spend a lot less time on the human drama and way more time with the monster development kong is amazing here fantastic fight scenes and you will hate the villain one of the best kaiju movies of all time 
Mar 31 2024,positive,this movie is straight up fun not an oscar winner  but a lot of fun
Mar 31 2024,positive,it is a silly movie  but totally enjoyed it
Mar 31 2024,positive,the movie exemplified everything that fans of godzilla expect and love about the franchise    the action sequences were expertly crafted and pushed the limits of what weve seen before resulting in a truly exhilarating experience it was a cinematic thrill ride that took viewers on a journey through a world of giant monsters leaving them on the edge of their seats throughout the entire film     i would definitely watch this again
Mar 31 2024,positive,amazing movie and a really fun time
Mar 31 2024,positive,i love that movie i have all the movies of godzilla and the original king kong v godzilla
Mar 31 2024,positive,full of adventures realistic emotional funny everything is packed with action cast is wonderful great cinematography vfx department worked really well kudos to crew members awesome
Mar 31 2024,positive,excellent movieeee definitely a must see
Mar 31 2024,positive,this film was absolutely amazing
Mar 31 2024,positive,the movie is good but it could had been made more better honestly the villains could had been made more evil but i guess we have to adjust with this one
Mar 31 2024,positive,do not listen to the critics this movie was stunning but id admit that the first 30 mins or so felt like a 3 star but the rest of it was great ive been a fan of the monsterverse for a while now and this was one of the best for sure
Mar 31 2024,positive,the movie so fun and awesome and the vfx and fight scenes are cool
Mar 31 2024,positive,most fun youll have at the movies this year basically a kaiju rollercoaster ride that doesnt disappoint if that sounds fun to you than youll love it if your looking for something deeper pull out your copy of oppenheimer because this is not that kind of film
Mar 31 2024,positive,absolute treat for ppl who monsters fight  also had new lore exploration abt goji  and references  comical fight scene everything was worth watching please dont make kong and goji enemies again we want this team movie again 
Mar 31 2024,positive,do you like rollercoasters and enjoying a movie without thinking about overcomplexity if your answer is yes this movie is for you    fresh off of viewing the previous entry into the monsterverse series by legendary pictures godzilla x kong the new empire brings the superstar kaiju godzilla back for another adventure in saving the world and this time there are many new faces including the infamous scar king and shimo    godzillas name comes first in the title though his involvement is belated a vast duration of the films runtime is centered around kong as he explores the hollow earth in search of his species    the film from start to finish is a rollercoaster with nonstop action the lighthearted and comicbooklike portrayal of characters makes the movie appeal to a broader audience without having to catch up with every entry in the series so far     as a longtime godzilla fan i can say with confidence that this movie made me feel like a kid watching showaera godzilla films once again it was good fun that gives all of the kaiju combat you need on a deeper level films like godzilla minus one scratch that itch for an intense emotional story with the seriousness cranked to 11
Mar 31 2024,positive,it was a fun and enjoyable and entertaining movie i gotta say
Mar 31 2024,positive,best thing ive ever watch
Mar 31 2024,positive,enjoyed the fight scenes as always overall a pretty good movie but i grew up watching godzilla so i am impartial anyway story was pretty good and the human aspect wasnt overbearing
Mar 31 2024,positive,if youre a fan of the monsterverse and solely want some crazy kaiju action and not care too much about the humans in it  then this movie would not disappoint in you so much fun gonna see it again but in 3d
Mar 31 2024,positive,i paid to see two of the coolest monsters in cinematic history fight eachother and other monsters and got more than my money worth excellent monster mash stunning visuals and great character making in both hero and monster villains only downside is the human parts but i do understand why the humans are nessecary for a movie

Mar 31 2024,positive,loved it  i cant wait to see the next one
Mar 31 2024,positive,this movie treats monsters as characters and give them emotions for monsters their dialogue is their body language godzilla and kong are the superstar and hero of this movie

Mar 31 2024,positive,the special effects were amazing
Mar 31 2024,positive,quality family fun great cgi and creativity a little long for me but decent acting and lots of action
Mar 31 2024,positive,the human elements did not work at all too much time spent on focusing on humans rather than building more character for skar king and his dominion this is kongs story and godzilla was a bit sidelined but the fighting was great needed more stake and more fighting story was very simple and could have been better i would really like them to get back to the tone of 2014s godzilla in theatre the movie is enjoyable beause of the fight scenes which worked for me but more would have been great this is a one time watch
Mar 31 2024,positive,great movie enjoyed the whole movie knowing backgrounds about titans did help if not i could see it being confusing at first
Mar 31 2024,positive,the movie is a phenomenon it shows a lot of excitment with the kaiju brawls and the human character arent halfbad
Mar 31 2024,positive,saw it in imax today and had such a great time my friend who is not really into kaiju media very much also had an amazing time and we were laughing throughout it was such a fun movie the monster design is a highlight but so is the bouncy atmosphere shimo was gorgeous much prettier than i thought from promotional material and toys there was a great balance between the human story and the monster story i enjoyed the silly characters on both sides of that divide ill probably be going again while its in theaters so my boyfriend can watch it with me next hope we get another movie in this same vibe focusing more on godzillas backstory
Mar 31 2024,positive,loved this movie the way monsters interact between themselves and the fights make you want a little more

Mar 31 2024,positive,this is the best monsterverse movie theyve made thus far its the most fun ive had watching a movie for awhile
Mar 31 2024,positive,the characterization and emotion in the monsters of gxk is unmatched in the monsterverse you are truly able to connect with and experience these monsters the narrative prioritizes its development of kong over anything else trimming the fat and allowing us to get to what we want to see giant monster fights
Mar 31 2024,positive,really fun and fantastic movie my favorite of the monsterverse movies a lot better than a lot of stuff coming out as of recent great action and love the titans kong is the star of the film

Mar 31 2024,positive,didnt get to see the movie bought tickets to the wrong day

Mar 31 2024,positive,action from beginning to end  i wanted to see giant monsters fight and they delivered
Mar 31 2024,positive,i liked the story characters and kaiju i feel like the animation for the kaiju were a bit different well it didnt look as realistic as the previous movies not that it really matters much anyway great movie
Mar 31 2024,positive,aside of the soundtrack its a must see movie it really brings out the overthetop fights from the 60s and 70s godzilla movies the human characters feel more fleshed out than they were in godzilla vs kong
Mar 31 2024,negative,some of the monster battles were fine the 2 battles with godzilla and the lesser monsters were very disappointing he just basically wins a few seconds no plot and no interesting characters no questions answered a lot of the movie doesnt make sense
Mar 31 2024,positive,its fun to watch kong as an endearing grumpy old man and op godzilla was badass a fun as hell popcorn flick
Mar 31 2024,positive,awesome movie but very colorful  lol
Mar 31 2024,positive,good movie even my wife who is not a king king nor godzilla fan enjoyed itgood storyline highly recommended 
Mar 31 2024,neutral,i loved the fast action what i disliked was not the movie but the theater that was showing it did not turn down the house lights until someone finally complained which was well after the opening credits which was about 7 minutes into the movie the film was darkblurred on the far left which seemed like a projectionist not paying attention but i loved the movie enough to go back and see it again  i was not impressed with 3d it did not have the depth of other 3d films i have seen and the plot was not totally coherent
Mar 31 2024,positive,few things not explained in the story but nonstop monster action fun
Mar 31 2024,positive,big fan of kong  godzilla this movie was great
Mar 31 2024,positive,better than the last

Mar 31 2024,positive,incredible spectacle with breathtaking visuals and a nice plot to top it off
Mar 31 2024,neutral,movie doesnt trust audience with plot exposition dump final boss underwhelming
Mar 31 2024,positive,excellent movie the plot flowed well especially for kong we also learn more about jia and where her tribe originated from highly recommended
Mar 31 2024,positive,the dreamteam we never knew we wanted to see
Mar 31 2024,positive,twas the best action packed adventure movie ive seen in a long timer with just so much hype and characters with great emotion a truly amazing movie and a fun time to enjoy with anyone filled with excitement and eager to see what comes next
Mar 31 2024,negative,cgi  the characters where beyond corny and annoying 2 hrs of my life ill never get back you can tell they put no effort into this movie easily forgettable
Mar 31 2024,positive,good movie team godzilla liked the interactions between all of them
Mar 31 2024,positive,seen it at the drive in and i must say it was the best movie this year very action packed with laughs
Mar 31 2024,positive,godzilla x kong is fun packed movie which wont let you get off your seat the movies picturization and cgi are top notch kongs character development and the bond between jiya and ilene has also developed which is a good thing jiya was given a great responsibility in the movie which gives her a good development as a character who was thought to be useless by many including me however some other characters in the movie such as godzilla mothra and shimo were underutilized godzilla is literally the king of the monsters and the movie treated him like a side character adam wingard focuses only on kong and characters related to him perhaps he should focus a little bit more on godzilla as he plays an integral role in the monsterverse i would have appreciated the movie more if all these points were followed and if the monster lore was explored even more  i give this movie a score of 475
Mar 31 2024,positive,action packed great special effects  story line we love godzilla  kong
Mar 31 2024,positive,superb combat well done scenes through and through
Mar 31 2024,positive,its godzilla what do you expect
Mar 31 2024,positive,i am very happy with what i saw the movie is very cool and i liked almost everything but something needs to be done about the franchise if adam wingard makes a sequel then he and the films team should slow down and slightly change their approach like all monsterverse films the new empire impressed me very much
Mar 31 2024,positive,had so much  fun  havent felt something this exciting since infinity war 
Mar 31 2024,positive,i liked the movie because my sons and my nieces liked it
Mar 31 2024,positive,awesome movie from the story to the graphics definitely had us sitting on edge and will definitely be seeing it again
Mar 31 2024,positive,this movie had me entertained from beginning to end king kong vs godzilla was one of the first films i vividly remember as a kid and i am so thankful for adam wingards direction since he took over with gvk i cast no shade on the previous entries i have the upmost respect for those films with that being said this movie really had me in the theaters cheering for godzilla and kong if you love absolute monster mayhem and science fiction insanity this movie is for you ignore the negativity i absolutely cannot wait to see what the future holds for the monsterverse
Mar 31 2024,positive,ive always been a fan of the tojo monster verse and this monster verse adaptation has been going well so far now its a goofy scifi film i think it really fits with giant monsters fighting it brings in new villains while bring back old protagonists this movie was just about having fun but it did have a lot of lore spoilers when it came to it although scar king was a generic villain he was still unique when it came to how he fought and how cocky he was shimo couldve been utilized more or explained more godzilla wasnt in it for too long for it being a godzilla x kong but all the scenes he was in were bad ass hope the next movie is more grounded and scary like 2014 or similar to kotm
Mar 31 2024,positive,def recommend amazing movie
Mar 31 2024,positive,lots of action which i enjoyed and was funny
Mar 31 2024,positive,if i had to describe this movie i would tell you one thing fun thats all it needed to be and it was but there is heart in it as well kong and suko was that heart with godzilla being the destruction and power of this movie and kong being the heart the only problem i have is theending not because it was bad no it was amazing it just was to short but besides that the humans where actually good in this film stop complaining about them they where fun evertime they were on the screen i was actually enjoying myself unlike kotm not amazing but they were good enough to root for them the villains where very good with scar king theres a false king that rules the kongs species and treats them like dirt for shimo she was a big puppy that was being missed treated by her owner but besides the constant teleportion of characters the movie was amazing the best in the monsterverse by far
Mar 31 2024,positive,adam wingard knew exactly what he was doing with this movie its confidently and bombastically an epic monster brawler that never lets up from start to finish and has its heart in the right place i think thats why the audience score is so high people just enjoy fun
Mar 31 2024,positive,has so much action am definitely watching again
Mar 31 2024,neutral,godzilla x kongs titan monster clashing scenes were memorable but the characters were left charmless and dimwitted kong appeared as a shell of the king kongsmashing protagonist everyone has come to adore the juvenile kong was irrelevant and shouldve remained inconspicuous its a good film for viewing the notable titan legends clash but slightly disappointing compared to its predecessors
Mar 31 2024,positive,bad characters silly action little good
Mar 31 2024,positive,quit hating this was pretty cool 
Mar 31 2024,positive,without a doubt it is an excellent movie that delivers what it promises nonstop monster fights

Mar 31 2024,positive,great movie funny action packed little kong is funny
Mar 31 2024,positive,hated the acting but man other then that what a threat movie hahah
Mar 31 2024,positive,as a very big godzilla fan any movie that has the bigg in it is a awesome movie and this movie was awesome although it has its flaws i personally think its pretty cool and adam wingards mind is full of creativity and most critics dont see the fun part of this movie most of them are just to serious like loosen up this isnt a very serious movie although it has its serious parts its a funny laugh out loud kids dream type of movie    anyway pls checkout my youtube channel feathered rex2yt and until next timeenjoy the movies
Mar 31 2024,positive,im definitely going back to see this
Mar 31 2024,positive,action from beginning to end it was fun and interesting more monsters just enough human to tie it together definitely left it it open for the next movie
Mar 31 2024,positive,omg not only the thrills but the entertainment and interactions was on point   wow love the new tag team fights even tho i couldnt get why kong  godzilla had to have a bout  overall it was great even when the little helper kong joined in for a few laughs
Mar 31 2024,positive,great movie in my opponent the action scores a cut above the rest of monster verse although felt rushed at times i also think the storyline was an optimal route for the movie also great to see kong and godzilla at it
Mar 31 2024,positive,i saw the movie in imax 3d and it looks fantastic the battles are big loud and frequent the plot is simplistic but keeps the action moving overall it was a lot of fun and some real eye candy on the big screen especially in 3d two thumbs up from me
Mar 31 2024,positive,good movie for all family team godzilla
Mar 31 2024,positive,top tier godzilla movie packed with lots of action

Mar 31 2024,positive,i enjoyed it entertaining and the fight scenes were great
Mar 31 2024,positive,loved it  cant wait for the next one but i didnt like how the 4 titans fight was so little at the end of the movie but all around 910 
Mar 31 2024,positive,you have to see this film we focused more on the monsters and other creatures learn more about hollow earth and theres enough fighting and humor to carry you through to the emotional moments go see it youll love it
Mar 31 2024,positive,love the fights and godzilla alway kicks ass
Mar 31 2024,positive,the movie really gave us more of a background to a bigger world i know the kids will love baby kong the references and homages to many monsters were awesome i feel legendary did great with these characters definitely gave that feeling of watching some of the old ones
Mar 31 2024,positive,an epic insane thrill ride from beginning to end and i loved every minute of it
Mar 31 2024,positive,i am amazed at the cinematic graphics that children can enjoy nowadays with movies like this it is 100x better than all i have seen of past kong movies the human elementstory continue to be very simple dumb and implausible while the graphics are like lightyears ahead of the game do us humans continue to be so important visavis nature and the universe i dont believe so i kept on thinking about a movie called gods land in which there were long takes of how big and grandiose nature compared to the insignificance and fragility of the human being but hollywood for some reason continues to push the narrative that we are bigger and more important than we really are which produces silly stories like the human part in godzilla x kong i enjoyed the graphics but not planning to watch it in imax id rather go back to kungfu panda for the 4th time
Mar 31 2024,positive,be sure to unplug your brain for this one action packed and fast paced if you loved the previous movie youll like this one too just wish there were more kong x godzilla interactions
Mar 31 2024,positive,loads of fun and humor definitely action packed not sure why critics are punishing this film oh well guess theyre not crazy about the monsterverse
Mar 31 2024,positive,not enough godzilla for me seemed like baby kong got more screen time haha still a solid watch tho
Mar 31 2024,positive,i loved the fights and new characters
Mar 31 2024,positive,wow super fun time non stop action that somehow keeps getting better with every minute  great movie
Mar 31 2024,positive,are there a lot of plot holes yes  does the movie make sense no  are there moments where it makes you say really yes    but the movie is very fun lol so many monster fights very popcorn movie
Mar 31 2024,positive,this was such a fun movie i loved it im a huge godzilla and kong fan so how could i not love it i gave it 5 stars for the awesome fun factor
Mar 31 2024,positive,just came out the theaters and this is definitely the best monsterverse movie  godzilla was given the respect he finally deserves such a powerhouse  this movie was just epic i cant say more without spoiling
Mar 31 2024,positive,the movie is simply everything i hoped i would watch it again and again
Mar 31 2024,positive,solid better in 3d also more like a kong movie with godzilla as a supporting actor i enjoyed it beyond the imagination
Mar 31 2024,positive,do not listen to the critics this is the most fun ive had in a movie theater since spiderman atsv this movie is action packed and has so many good monsters and for godzilla fans such as me youre in for the greatest movie theater experience for people who just want to watch will also have such a fun experience
Mar 31 2024,positive,i think its great cgis good and mid at some parts the humans as always are kinda weak but we dont come here for humans and i think thats whats critics want they want a emotional story and dark themes but its about monsters and thats what we want not humans talking and this movie delivers
Mar 31 2024,positive,great movie def looking for the next sequel
Mar 31 2024,positive,loved every second great visuals funny parts
Mar 31 2024,positive,i love godzilla and kong it continues from the movie godzilla vs kong kong continues with exploring more of hollow earth  i like how kong get find the last bit of his kind and the evil skar king    godzilla like how godzilla evolves in this movie and godzilla sleeping spots in this movie is kind funny to me love movies like this the amazing godzilla kong movie i thank love how kong is king now in hollow earth now all the gorillas are happy now skar king is gone and felt like it was some what planets of the apes i dont like how godzilla kong was running in hollow earth it look like they made godzilla kong cgi look bad but just one part
Mar 31 2024,positive,the film delivers on massive monster battles but the plotstory compares poorly to godzilla minus one     far too much of godzilla x kong is cgi  and not particularly impressive cgi  hollow earth often looked like the background of a 20 year old video game and the scenes with water were particularly lacking any realism      all said its loud and has lots of monster battles but is ultimately pretty forgettable
Mar 31 2024,positive,good story doesnt drag on and reminds you why titan movies are the best
Mar 31 2024,positive,i loved it it was funny and action packed definitely looking forward to owning it on bluray
Mar 31 2024,positive,its a fun time with great action serviceable storyline and great cgi its the embodiment of old godzilla movies done with modern style

Mar 31 2024,positive,the greatest movie of all time the scenes and battles were the best godzillas design was perfected godzilla was a beast

Mar 31 2024,positive,awesome sequel funny and tons of action no boring parts
Mar 31 2024,positive,i loved this movie  i was incredibly emotionally invested in kong and the little friend he found  its mostly about kong but that doesnt mean theres not tons of bonkers kaiju action  i was not bored even for a moment and i even cried at one point  only criticism is that they gave rebecca hall the worst haircut of all time  i enjoyed it and so did my fellow audience  everyone clapped when it was over  critics can suck it this movie is great
Mar 31 2024,positive,godzilla x kong new empire delivers everything you want in a godzilla or kong film lots of titan fighting with great visuals and humour a true masterpiece
Mar 31 2024,positive,love love love great interconnection between the king and king of monsters  definitely going to see it again
Mar 31 2024,positive,awesome movie lots of monster action cgi was great
Mar 31 2024,positive,this movie overall was great i absolutely loved the graphics the storyline was alright ill talk about that in a second and overall the cast was awesome for the storyline the storyline however i felt like was rushed as events kept happening pretty quick right after another and for some events you didnt have a clear view what was going on i strongly suggest that you watch at least watch kong skull island before watching this movie as it does tie back into it at certain parts of the movie to avoid confusion and for some you almost have to know some of the lore of the other movies to be able to understand some of this movie but overall this movie was a great movie and i highly suggest it
Mar 31 2024,positive,love it king kong is such a gangsta

Mar 31 2024,positive,thus movie is awesome 
Mar 31 2024,negative,this is the worst godzilla movie ever made i honestly didnt think it was possible to make a worse movie than all monsters attack but adam wingard somehow managed to pull it off god theres so much wrong with this movie that i dont even know where id start the best way to summarize it is that theres only one redeeming quality to this entire movie that redeeming quality being the presence of mothra even then her screentime probably doesnt make up a full minute in total
Mar 31 2024,negative,what did i just watch how did tony stark get into this movie the very dry humor and lazy performances should have may this movie freewith tacos the fighting scenes are okand i mean just ok the human acting is boring and dry it might have been better with just the monsters and subtitles just overall bad

Mar 31 2024,negative,outside of the cgi slugfest spectacle the story is an expositionheavy plotconvenient boring mess the human characters are reminiscent of the transformer movies unnecessary unfunny dumb and underdeveloped

Mar 31 2024,positive,we really loved itit was exciting and fast paced with some extraordinary beautiful scenery  it was action packed and had a real story linewhich was really heartfelt   it also had some funny parts along with some heartfelt ones  this movie is for the entire family to enjoy
Mar 31 2024,negative,ive been a mega godzilla fan since the cold war sixties japanese epics but had i not spent 60 bucks with popcorn i would have walked out after the first 15 minutes i sat with a hood over my head to nap until the final monster mash at the end when godzilla finally showed up poor kong  in this age of wokedom these characters shamefully resemble well known actors the derivative devices and characters from every mainstream movie from the floating fuzz from stranger things to the dobby based  orangutan from harry potter not to mention transformers are embarrassing and shall i say insulting possibly the worst movie ive ever sat through second only to the last airbenders which i walked out on
Mar 31 2024,positive,it was exactly as expected and my family enjoyed it
Mar 31 2024,positive,the move was dope it continues to level up as the movies go along in this universe the only thing ill say is that it took a little long to get into the actual story but once it did it definitely took off solid movie and i cant wait to see what happens next
Mar 31 2024,positive,super fun time we get the best of both worlds with godzilla minus one providing a serious and scary godzilla with legendary filling the space for the showa era with  bombastic action and monster fights galore
Mar 31 2024,positive,pretty good movie wish they tied more of it to the show that came out on apple good fight scenes
Mar 31 2024,positive,it was the best one out of the whole monsterverse  finally a balance between dialogue and action everything made sense
Mar 31 2024,positive,lots of action great special effects and some cute humor made this a terrific movie
Mar 31 2024,positive,i loved the story line
Mar 31 2024,negative,the action was interesting but all of the side plots and questionable acting distracted from it where is godzilla minus ones team
Mar 31 2024,positive,fun movie i like that they had more fighting scenes
Mar 31 2024,positive,this movie was absolutely a thriller very humorous it was action packed it was so great i love king kong and godzilla no bias
Mar 31 2024,positive,absolutely non stop titans fights
Mar 31 2024,positive,this was amazing monster fight big monster 10002
Mar 31 2024,positive,it does a very good job of flushing out the history behind the monsters and the roles they played in the ancient world but feels like it abruptly ends the monster battles are insane but i just wish there was a bit more still a fun movie though
Mar 31 2024,positive,best in the mv so far kong story is amazing and emotional the humans have a compelling story and doesnt detract from the movie at all and big g just wrecks house crazy fun spectacle for all the family a showa film brought to 2024
Mar 31 2024,positive,this supernatural action film is really good very emotional arc and do like out more of kong and get see how human he can be plus godzilla how he can very protective with people on earth the cgi and visuals is amazing especially hollow earth and comedy is not bad but could be funnier and how they connect the little girl and kong and why they feel alone but as movie process you can see that they r not alone but loved and do like how kong and that little guy become great mentor and father figure to him the bad guy doesnt feel threating enough for me coward yes you kind of expect that and one more thing the movie gets going right way not bored at all and fighting in end c9ild have better but ends with they can could go more of this i give a a and definitely recommend
Mar 31 2024,positive,loved the movie if you want a perfect characterdriven monster movie go watch godzilla minus one but if you want a fullon kaiju smackdown kong and godzilla tag team and fullon mayhem this movie is for you just fun fun fun and fun
Mar 31 2024,positive,the movie is a 1010 the cgi and the effects on this movies is absolutely crazy and out of this world
Mar 31 2024,positive,it was very good if you follow the comics
Mar 31 2024,positive,the movie was mid it felt rush in the beginning and in the end the main antagonist skar king is a pushover losing to kong the first time they met and has to bring in shimo whos not that strong either to take care of kong godzilla randomly jumps in the movie which is unrealisticand the film randomly showing figures of godzilla and kong is unrealistic if they ever existed because they cause thousands of deaths when they fought imagine you go to a relatives funeral because they died to godzilla and your young cousin or brother or sister is holding a godzilla figure shimo is a wasted kaiju because he dont care im calling shimo a boy was getting destroyed by godzilla in the brazil fight and if you just go there just to see the after credits spoiler alert there wasnt there save you guys 20 or 40 dollars if you want to see a better godzilla film with fights and lore watch godzilla 2014 or godzilla vs kong now so i dont get jumped by the fans you can still watch it if you want and its unfortunately my opinion
Mar 31 2024,positive,godzilla is a boss i liked this movie it had incredible views and some cool battles
Mar 31 2024,positive,if youre into monster movies godzilla or kong in particular this is your movie

Mar 31 2024,positive,1010 loved the movie and the story i loved godzilla and kong and skar king and shimo they were very menacing the final battle was amazing as well i hope they make more films in the monsterverse
Mar 31 2024,positive,exciting and opens the way to more
Mar 31 2024,positive,saw it in 3 d great special effects
Mar 31 2024,positive,great film for what it is good fight scenes some cool titans and new characters the cinematography is fantastic if you enjoy this genre its a good watch
Mar 31 2024,positive,godzilla is the goat
Mar 31 2024,positive,the most fun ive had at the movies in a long time it was nice for the monsters to be able to take center stage for once is the godfather no but its a more than adequate giant monster action film
Mar 31 2024,positive,we all loved the expressions of king the movie was great everyone enjoyed the movie
Mar 31 2024,positive,its action packed with some animal mannerism comedy
Mar 31 2024,positive,excellent fighting scenes

Mar 31 2024,positive,peak cinema super fun and memorable really funny at times
Mar 31 2024,positive,this movie is one wild ride i loved it a former monster fan i absolutely loved this movie from the monsters to the plot and human characters very well done i am excited to see where this story will go from here
Mar 31 2024,positive,all i can say is woow it was great 
Mar 31 2024,positive,fun fast paced movie reminds me of the old 60s and 70s godzilla i grew up with
Mar 31 2024,negative,terrible movie they put absolutely no respect to godzilla he was definitely not a main character also getting rid of characters luke scylla and tiamat with a fight that lasted seconds making them seem less strong than suko lol the movie was all over the place with basically no story the whole movie was adding opposing titans and wiping the floor with them over and over again the cgi was not good like when godzilla blew up scylla it looked very bad the fact that scar king was a joke when he is supposed to be the main antagonist is funny to me i also think the fight with godzilla and kong was the same in many aspects and kong punching godzilla over and over again just made me feel sad i feel that kong and godzilla should be equal but they just made godzilla look like a joke in the fight with godzilla and kong the movie ended super abruptly and had me initially wondering if the second half of the movie was going to play but then the credits rolled up im dissatisfied with this movie especially after godzilla 2014 2019 and also godzilla vs kong sorry if it was long but i was super excited this movie but it just seemed like a thrown together messy movie entirely about kong suko literally got more screen time than godzilla lol
Mar 30 2024,positive,great movie its very entertaining
Mar 30 2024,positive,i went to a 3d showing the graphics were mostly great but there were a few places on earth views that was blah  the fighting and storyline were great
Mar 30 2024,positive,i loved watched in imax
Mar 30 2024,positive,great movie with lots of action  the graphics were a1
Mar 30 2024,positive,great job making this movie  enjoyed it
Mar 30 2024,positive,if the 1980s had good cgi it would have released this flick
Mar 30 2024,positive,i liked too much this movie the battles characters places and more were so excelent this movie brings us how our two famous titans live in the hollow earth and outside of it and brought what all of we want epic battles a thing that we all godzilla fans lovebut not just that moments of fun were sometimes i laughed thanks to the director adam wingard and to the mv
Mar 30 2024,positive,best of the series great story and lot of action highly recommended not a dull moment
Mar 30 2024,positive,i lovef the movieloved all the kajuigodzilla and kong were bsdassbut disappointed in scar i thought he would be biggerits going g to be hard to top however
Mar 30 2024,positive,amazing movie focused on godzilla and kong and other titans in this movie 1010
Mar 30 2024,positive,i went to see it yesterday with a friend we walked 38 miles to see it and im happy to say it was worth it between the silly fights the bucket load of easter eggs the phenomenal cast the music i could go on for hours because adam wingard understands how to make a good godzilla film
Mar 30 2024,positive,its hard to say what the best part was  the whole movie was amazing i wanted to watch it again immediately
Mar 30 2024,positive,its like acdc action never stopped
Mar 30 2024,positive,great movie  loved the actions
Mar 30 2024,positive,very good movie and is worth the money to pay for the tickets
Mar 30 2024,positive,great battles and story and characters
Mar 30 2024,positive,i think its what a monster movie should be the fights where amazing  i didnt mind the human characters its a real crowd pleaser
Mar 30 2024,positive,honestly just dumb fun matched my expectations and exceed them a few times with good meta humor
Mar 30 2024,positive,title doesnt match the plot should be war of monster new empire
Mar 30 2024,positive,its an action movie for a whole family
Mar 30 2024,positive,big lizard and monke fighting bigger ice lizard and other monke rahhh
Mar 30 2024,positive,great movie im a huge godzilla fan so i enjoyed every minute of it
Mar 30 2024,positive,if you are a fan of the showaera godzilla films this is a spiritual successor in the best ways possible fantastic scifi style story and visuals more kaiju action than any monsterverse film before and its just so much fun if you are more into the serious grounded type of godzilla movies you may not enjoy this one as much but its still a good time the human characters arent in contact as much with the titans as in the last movie but they do have a pretty good story of their own to compliment the titan action my only complaint is i feel the two villainous titans didnt really get to do much honestly but other than that i had a great time
Mar 30 2024,positive,it perfect and amazing for crossover best of the best
Mar 30 2024,positive,tons of monster action more than ever before great fights and a fast pace make this one of the better monsterverse flicks it also features kong using something totally hilarious as a weapon at one point he gets far more screen time than godzilla which is probably my only gripe had a heck of a good time with this one
Mar 30 2024,positive,the movie was awesome cant wait for the next one
Mar 30 2024,positive,fun action filled fluffif you like kong or godzillaits awesome
Mar 30 2024,positive,the final fight scene was absolutely epic
Mar 30 2024,positive,classic monster mayhem
Mar 30 2024,positive,meant to be seen on the giant screen brought back the good ole fashion 70s 80s feel to the old godzilla weekend movie trips a fun watch storyline kept it together not big on overall drama but wasnt expecting that when the whole point was to stay focused on the action of the two main characters
Mar 30 2024,negative,not staying true to the godzilla story line
Mar 30 2024,positive,big monke fun but human boring bad human take to long to talk monke punch 
Mar 30 2024,neutral,time sinking move    spoilers     a movie of plot convenience characters and kaijus seem to be in the right place at the right time for when the plot need them to be take for instance dan stevens character he teleports from one place to the next and they have exactly what they need when they need it the big bad kaiju is no real threat at all the title is miss leading at the end of the movie there is on new empire to speak off it is all ways fun to see kaijus fighting and the scenes with kong are fun but i kept finding myself waiting for the next big fight which is probably the point of these movies
Mar 30 2024,positive,the sound effects was awesome i think the whole movie was amazing
Mar 30 2024,positive,a great action packed  popcorn flick just like the meg movies a lot of the story line was a stretch even for a monster movie but the action scenes were awesome and the little ape stole the show
Mar 30 2024,positive,this movie is a home run  it accomplished what i wanted for the last 4 movies which is more monsters less humans it took a step back and let the titans shine without completely burying the human plot  5 stars definitely recommend
Mar 30 2024,positive,awesome fun right mix of story and action
Mar 30 2024,negative,all this film succeeded in doing was giving me a headache such a convoluted plot and what seemed like 90 minutes of crash bang wallop which was just too loud  so repetitive should really have trusted my instincts having seen kong island and avoided this
Mar 30 2024,positive,great visuals fun battles good story under 2 hours
Mar 30 2024,positive,it was honestly amazing i never got bored while watching it so i would recommend it to anyone whos looking for a fun thrilling monster movie with well written humans but the only complaint i have is that the final action sequence was too short but still enjoyable it is absurd how low the tomatoscale is and to end this review off minus one and gxk should not get compared as theyre totally different movies and vibe g1 is more into the horror aspect gxk is more of a fun goofy thriller
Mar 30 2024,positive,it was a awesome movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,i love when the audience comes together and loves a movie and the critics dont understand why its a great movie full of action and the kids were amazed
Mar 30 2024,positive,thoroughly enjoyable a but fast paced based on the story line but still a great follow up to godzilla vs kong
Mar 30 2024,positive,i loved it it was action packaged with funny scenes it kept me engaged
Mar 30 2024,positive,if you want a fun monster action flick then this is what you must watch fun silly and doesnt take itself too seriously
Mar 30 2024,positive,great battle scenes but story seems a little absurd
Mar 30 2024,positive,great multi monster battles probably 85 to 90 of the movie had the monsters in them i thought it was great
Mar 30 2024,positive,enjoyed it more than the previous franchise movie fun to watch worth matinee or cheapnight prices unless youre a big fan of the franchise andor kaiju movies will likely watch again streaming but i dont think ill spend money to see it again
Mar 30 2024,positive,very good movie i went with my friends and it was the best day of my life
Mar 30 2024,positive,amazing movie already seen it twice cant wait to go again
Mar 30 2024,positive,great fun and great monster battlesat both viewings the crowd cheered and both had applause at the end 9 out of 10love we have a serious godzilla timeline with toho and a fun showa era timeline with legendarykeep them coming guys  its godzillas world we just live in it
Mar 30 2024,positive,fight scene at end felt fast movie did good job building up lots of movie was shown early in trailers if watched too many still plenty left unseen king of the monsters finished on a stronger note imo might just be director style
Mar 30 2024,negative,this film is a mess the first half was ok but then it devolved into a planet of the apes remake with a touch of avatar whats with all the wisecracking i guess i got spoiled by an intelligent godzilla in godzilla minus one
Mar 30 2024,neutral,its a fun time just dont expect it to be anything other than that
Mar 30 2024,positive,a fun classic toho monster crash mayhem movie with super special effects this movie is so much fun dont take it seriously go see it for what it is big godzilla kong and total mayhem they do a lot of things right in this movie they focus on the monsters more than the people which lets face it the cast is okay but nowhere near as important as the cast in minus one but who cares this is monster after monster destroying things to their greatness they do such a great job of destroying things and you sit there going oh hell yes do not expect minus one in this movie you wont get it but you will get a great monster movie toho should be smiling big time its a lot of fun
Mar 30 2024,positive,it was a very nice movie really enjoyed it how they came together to save the people and the little girl was the key helped save a civilization
Mar 30 2024,positive,the movie is a must watch if youre a true monster fan  grew up watching monster movies with family watch this grew up watching monster movies alone or playing video games watch this  though the movie is focused more on kong you can feel and see how he is with encountering suko  even though they truly stuck with one storyline with humans i loved it compared to the other films before this because we got to see how it blended into the hollow earth with the sense of home or where you belong  i suggest seeing this for fun magic and wonder or to see monsters fight and we do see that and i enjoyed it especially the kid in me
Mar 30 2024,positive,probably the best mv movie ever
Mar 30 2024,positive,giant monsters fighting cant go wrong
Mar 30 2024,positive,sometimes what the people want is just some fast packed action to numb their minds to and to hype about this movie delivers in just that 910 as the overall story isnt super unique but i believe in this movie that is not needed definitely a must watch
Mar 30 2024,positive,while there is little to no substance in the story godzilla x kong is such a good time it takes a bit to get going with its for the most part uninteresting human characters but the movie eventually finds its footing when all the seperated storylines begin to converge though kong and godzillas team up comes a lot later in the movie than i initially thought it would i feel the build up is done nicely and the pay off is rather cool the big bad skar king is a very intimidating villain but again i wish they got to his part in the film a lot quicker while they share the title this is very much kongs movie godizlla at times feels nothing more than a glorified cameo but his moments are some of the best in the film while i wasnt really emotionally attatched to the human characters the heart of the film comes in the form of kong and his relation ship with suko baby kong there time on screen makes me wish that the entire movie was centered around them overall the movie is a typically good monsterverse movie where it lacks a compelling human story the action and monster frenzy is there to pick up the slack
Mar 30 2024,positive,its a big flashy fun time at the movies  its not perfect but it still delivers an entertaining time
Mar 30 2024,positive,great movie cant wait for the next one 
Mar 30 2024,positive,it was better than i expected lots of action after a slow start
Mar 30 2024,positive,was a fun movie experience but just like all the american godzilla movies you just want most of the humans in the movie to get eaten cuz you just dont care about them at all seriously the acting prowess of the cgi kong was better than the one expression young girl who is the key to everything in this movie despite that the movie did focus more on big monsters on screen doing big monster things and it was fun to watch
Mar 30 2024,positive,truly great godzilla and kong movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,hellz yeah just a dang good time
Mar 30 2024,positive,i liked the action of the movie i didnt like the mockery of the holy bible and the references blaspheming thereof respectively saying
Mar 30 2024,positive,big dumb fun thats all
Mar 30 2024,neutral,it was fun to see at the movies saw it in dolby cinemabut its not good story is soso and dialogue is poor writers took shortcuts to move scenes along quickly but everyone cheered when they defeated the big mean ape 
Mar 30 2024,positive,what a fun ride amazing effects fantastic pacing dan stevens was having a blast pure kaiju action loved every second
Mar 30 2024,positive,it was lotsa fun kong stole the show godzilla was a juggernaut albeit the movie went from ok to a great last hour makes this gen xr feel like a kid again
Mar 30 2024,positive,gxk full of monster pack punch must watch
Mar 30 2024,neutral,might be a spolier indirectlysome directly      to people who liked the movie just pass it you could be bothered by this comment dont get me wrong i respect if you like it but this is my truth so here i go   there is no actual story in this movie you watch 10 minutes of kong and five seconds of godzilla including battle scenes this movie should have been a standalone movie for kong because godzilla appears in the title longer than any scenes he appears camera shows hime very little every time scar king was a joke team ups were forced mothra spawns out of nowhere jia was forced into this movie like all the human characters glove situation was even worse everything went too easy humans did stuff but everything they did was already ready to go i think they should change the way they go maybe relax a bit and give some standalone moviesso adam wingard wont have to force godzilla in a movie with 4 5 seconds each scene and make however he wants to make a kong movie while in the other hand gareth edwards giving us a real monster movie again warner bros should understand we dont want a kaiju marvel mixed movies i want to feel tension when a monster appears i didnt like the movie overall scenes were fun to watch i had fun no lie but i am not satisfied with anything because only thing this movie promises you is fun thats a good thing from some points just not mine
Mar 30 2024,positive,worth the watch if you go see it make sure to buy a 3d  4dx ticket makes the movie 10x better
Mar 30 2024,negative,there are too many themes in this one all over the place the baby kong was admirable im happy for the senior pricing
Mar 30 2024,positive,the movie was good with a lot of action as well with good humor will recommend anyone to see the movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,very good alot better than expected
Mar 30 2024,negative,as a kong fan i still see a weakness in this film namely that little godzilla action is shown because it only focuses on kong secondly i expected more from scar king it turns out hes just a coward who only relies on the ac remote even though there is a shimu the skar king should also be made strong or clever apart from relying on the shimu the question is in the trailer haya focuses skar king is not shimu the final battle is also briefly seen
Mar 30 2024,positive,visually it was amazing and the first half was well done kind of outlandish and off the rails with a rushed ending
Mar 30 2024,positive,the only disappointment i had there wasnt enough longevity in the fights amongst the other titans they relatively went by quick
Mar 30 2024,positive,the best one yet totally amazing
Mar 30 2024,positive,enjoy it for what it is and just have fun
Mar 30 2024,positive,fun movie to watch a lot of action had me at the edge of my seat the whole time
Mar 30 2024,positive,was better than expected 
Mar 30 2024,positive,we loved it a lot of action more about monsters and less about humans
Mar 30 2024,positive,lets start with my belief that rating all films vs all films is a fools errand instead it should be rated within genre  expectations when walking into gxk you know what youre getting into giant monsters beating the snot outta each other and anyone expecting kong to whisper rosebud on his deathbed needs to adjust their expectations    and as far as giant monsters beating the snot out of each other films go it lines up favorably with the best  rest of the monsterverse films    lets begin with the fandoms 2 complaints with the released trailer a trailer that had me concerned with the direction of gxk  1 the two titans seemingly pulling off the buddyaction hero film running away from the explosion scene this had me chuckling as well when i saw the trailer in theater while those frames still look odd in contexf no not running away from an explosion it makes sense  leads to a great fight scene    2 bpg big pink godzilla again without context its just odd 3 frames inserted into the trailer is all it would have taken to clear this up and give direction to fans wondering why the big g goes pink i understand filmmakers  studios wanting surprises in their films but on the other hand then start putting clauses in your licensing agreements with toymakers to not show or release surprise creatures before the film releases shimu was the worst kept secret in years    gxk also trims some of the fat from other films in the series its not fatfree by any means but the human element is much more focused this time around which lands this movie some extra love    as far as the monster battles theres some great stuff here  some great additions to the lore even if there are some contradictions theres quite a few extra fights beyond the teamup vs the big bad they may be smaller in scope but its great to see some other action  some other cool new monsters brought to life on the big screen    overall if youre going into this knowing what this series is about  it takes you away to the magic hollywood makes happen with things that dont exist and you enjoy the spectacle its going to deliver more than the trailer offered on par with whats come before it with ease    its a 4 12 star movie made 5 star by bringing back dooouuuug for another scene stealing cameo titanus doug baby
Mar 30 2024,negative,every cliché for humans but on apes and other monsters the fight scenes were great and i dont visit a monster movie for the plot but they shouldve kept it at ghidorah this was just trash

Mar 30 2024,positive,campy corny and absolutely awesome this is the kind of movies i wanna see more of
Mar 30 2024,positive,100 meter monsters punching each other for more than an hour this is peak cinema  its dumb all the dialogue only leads to show more fights theres barely any human in it and yet it is awesome

Mar 30 2024,positive,its a new fresh take on the franchise so far and so far its going into a good direction i hope that the next entry will be as good as this last movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,godzilla x kong the new empire has its clear issues but theyre all overshadowed by the sheer epicness this movie displays with its dazzling visuals amazing action and its overflowing amount of screen time for the kaiju a true love letter for kaiju fans    rating 86    action 8510  comedy 6510  drama 610  horror 2510  suspense 5510
Mar 30 2024,positive,my name is matthew hensley aka mattzilla on youtube and watching this in 3d made the scenes and monsters feel like that you can reach out and touch them and see them fall into your lap watching the visuals in this movie pop out in 3d shows how the team behind gxk the new empire put a lot of time and effort to stimulate the eyes in showcasing how beautiful a monster movie like this translates across cinema as a whole
Mar 30 2024,positive,a fun turn your brain off movie very action packed and full of comedy
Mar 30 2024,positive,while the human elements and story are passable godzilla x kong offers plenty of great kaiju action for most fans
Mar 30 2024,positive,had some narrative issuesbut the action scenes were great
Mar 30 2024,positive,very well done in cinematic roaring form finishes up nicely
Mar 30 2024,positive,turn your brain off to see this one

Mar 30 2024,positive,just watch it please give it a chance
Mar 30 2024,positive,this movie was made for thrill seekers and a bunch of action overall was a great add on to the monsterverse in my personal opinion its an awesome movie though needed some more backstory to the girl there were so many jump scares which made the story even better they also shouldve added more scenes that included how godzilla was doing 
Mar 30 2024,positive,loved it a true big screen experience
Mar 30 2024,positive,great movie must see on big screen
Mar 30 2024,positive,its great but the characters are still awful
Mar 30 2024,positive,this movie is everything youd want to see in a monsterverse movie and then some highly recommend
Mar 30 2024,positive,it was a great movie with absolute stunning visual and colour there is plenty of titan but if there was anything wrong the end fight was maybe to short except from that great film
Mar 30 2024,positive,gxk was so awesome imax is a must see for this movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,i went to watch it with my son and two nephews all 6 yr olds we enjoyed the movie and as their first godzillakong movie they are now fans felt like a blockbuster movie a lot of action some comedy       was a fun 2hr watch
Mar 30 2024,positive,this was a awesome movie full of action
Mar 30 2024,positive,i loved the no gravity fighting scene
Mar 30 2024,neutral,fast and furious for kids
Mar 30 2024,negative,this mess of a movie gets a one for a quality factor but it gets a for a good laugh so many bad things in this movie to mention but the dentist going into kongs mouth to fix a tooth was my favorite and when mothra appeared heshe look like a chinese lantern fly they did an awful job of trying to insert retro music into the movie like was done in guardians of the galaxy that was done well however in this movie it was laughable wait for this movie to come on a streaming service within the next week or so and dont spend your money at the theater to see this train wreck of a movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,excellent and fun movie to watch  really enjoyed the action sequences contrasted with the more emotional aspects an enjoyable afternoon
Mar 30 2024,positive,if youre a fan  of the others go see it not much to chew on for everyone else  action is good  humans interactions dont over stay their welcome
Mar 30 2024,positive,what else could you ask for in a godzilla x king movie action packed monster interactions which was a complaint of past movies
Mar 30 2024,positive,reading the critics reviews does not do this movie justice its exactly what it needs to be a  kaiju movie the action was top notch and you can feel the emotion from all of the monsters on how they communicate one of the best movies ive seen in a while
Mar 30 2024,positive,it was good but not great its worth a watch but was lacking in the storyline interested to know if the films will continue because there wasnt any post credit scene
Mar 30 2024,positive,highly recommend if you are kong or godzilla fan awesome action scenes and very enjoyable
Mar 30 2024,positive,really fun more about titans then the humans so a spectacle of amazing special effects
Mar 30 2024,positive,action was good rest of the movie was cheesy and so post 2020 style nonsense plot wasnt bad but overall just sorta a disappointing film
Mar 30 2024,positive,dont go in expecting a super deep movie that will be talked about for generations monster hit monster monster scream you enjoy 
Mar 30 2024,positive,i loved this movie critics are hilarious because in the first few movies of the saga they complained about showing humans too much and not enough monsters now theyre complaining about showing monsters too much and not the humans its hilarious     fight scenes were amazing theyve started giving the monsters human characteristics just like in the old films if youre an og godzilla fan youll love this movie i saw it in the midnight release and will be watching again
Mar 30 2024,positive,wuthering heights it aint but its really fun actionpacked movie delivers everything you could want from a kaiju pic amazing eyepoppingly rendered monster battles nicelyintegrated human story with more than a few laughs and it even has some heart i got verklempt at the end arguably the best monsterverse outing yet i cant wait for the next one
Mar 30 2024,positive,it was super entertaining with lots of humor embedded within the action a magnificent romp
Mar 30 2024,positive,the movie was great the action was amazing and the cast was brilliant its worth seeing 
Mar 30 2024,positive,this movie works as a neartheme park ride in a 4dx theater the story does not stand alone as far as a compelling or logical plot but it doesnt matter when you just allow this move to take you on a fun adventure that you probably will have to watch a recap of when you see the next installment in the monsterverse series
Mar 30 2024,positive,monster action really enjoyed it brought my kids and they liked it too fun watching the battle scenes
Mar 30 2024,positive,the movie was great and a lot of fun  a great popcorn movie the visuals were amazing and these critics mostly dont know what they are saying the only criticism is as a big godzilla fan kong has been given 80 of the screen time in the last 2 movies if this is a trilogy i really wish godzilla gets more attention in the next movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,big monster fight make brain good
Mar 30 2024,positive,unbelievably action packed a must watch monster madness king kong shines brightly again 
Mar 30 2024,positive,great movie enjoyed it im definitely watching it again
Mar 30 2024,positive,this movie is nothing short of incredible this is a move for fans not critics the fans are eating this movie up the monsterverse is here to stay 
Mar 30 2024,neutral,movie was poor until the introduction of the scar king then it was fun for the remainder
Mar 30 2024,positive,that was ridiculous and silly and id watch it again immediately
Mar 30 2024,positive,such a great film personally one of the best movies i seen i love it especially in 4dx the movie is way better love this 10 of 10 for me i recommend watching
Mar 30 2024,positive,fun movie with lots of action great mix of the classic monsters and some new ones the visuals are great but the story seemed rushed without much real development and some convenient drop ins the mothra reveal seemed a bit contrived in how she was brought out without explaining how she came to be when there was no egg this plot hole defies her classic history and the movie missed a great nostalgia moment to bring her out with mothras theme as an homage to the roots of this beloved kaiju     overall a great joy ride for mindless shallow fun
Mar 30 2024,positive,i love godzilla x kong  the acting was very good and the plot was very interesting  i like seeing godzilla and kong as allies instead of enemies  it was also great seeing mothra at the end  a very entertaining movie that i highly recommend
Mar 30 2024,positive,just turn off your brain and enjoy the monster carnage japan gives us an emptional rollercoaster and america gives us fun action
Mar 30 2024,positive,i loved this movie this movie manages to cater to the more american side of godzilla godzillas themes represent nuclear power a stark contrast gives major 1980s vibes which is perfect imo
Mar 30 2024,positive,the movie is so much fun be patient the story takes a while to unfold but it is worth the wait
Mar 30 2024,positive,i like the part when kong set booby traps on his enemies
Mar 30 2024,positive,absolutely love it watching it a second time in theatres
Mar 30 2024,negative,godzilla x kong the new empire fails to deliver a coherent narrative amidst its chaotic cgi  the plot points are left unresolved and unexplained and dangle precariously the storyline itself feels like a lazy patchwork of convenience this film lacks the depth and edge of its early predecessors it careens into cartoonish territory with green blood and a blatant disregard for the worldbuilding established by the legendary pictures franchise  what started as a promising venture for the 2014 godzilla audience has devolved into a shameless attempt to cater to the widest and safest net possible it resembles a formulaic outing akin to the modernera mcu the movie is devoid of effort and originality
Mar 30 2024,positive,a lot of monster action
Mar 30 2024,neutral,kind of basic writing everyone knew godzilla and kong would win really wish there was a monster that would holy wreck godzilla and actually seem powerful instead of having to only mess up kong just to seem powerful
Mar 30 2024,positive,this was great best king kong godzilla movie to date
Mar 30 2024,positive,was fun ride of a movie my kids had tons of enjoyment in this
Mar 30 2024,positive,action packed movie with plenty of monsters action with human interactions throughout awesome monstrous action sit back and enjoy 
Mar 30 2024,positive,awesome amazing effects
Mar 30 2024,positive,its really fun seeing it in 4dx
Mar 30 2024,positive,loved it great movie kong was the best
Mar 30 2024,positive,kept your attention all the way stunts and action were great just enough comedy and romance to make it work
Mar 30 2024,positive,it wasnt super deepbut it was a light fun titan rumble very fast paced movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,pretty awesome movie idk what the critics were thinking adam wingard gave us everything the community asked for a fun movie somewhat good human plot and a lot of monster action there were a couple flaws things that made no sense if you havent seen the movie spoilers ahead suko decided to just join kong despite being used as a club and having his caretakers killed and tiamat was insanely nerfed and didnt look much anything like the book still a great movie if you havent seen it definitely do so
Mar 30 2024,positive,this movie has got to be the best monsterverse movie i have ever seen it explained everything in the past how skar king was imprisoned by godzilla and the past and origin of shimo the mother of all titans i hope to see adam wingard make more monsterverse movies in the future i would like to see space godzilla and gamera destroyah especially zo zla halawa in the future and the past of all the monsters
Mar 30 2024,positive,very good movie throughout
Mar 30 2024,positive,my favorite monsterverse movie i was not expecting that i grinned so many times loved how they showcased the intelligence of the titans kong is my best bud now its really his movie world and character building continues apace soundtrack cues were hilarious would have been perfect if they played the promise by when in rome at the end but alas    the exposition was hilariously far fetched at times like you got all that from basically a couple panels of a comic ok why not but that actually fit quite well with the wacky and relentless fun of the movie    probably tiresome for people who arent at least somewhat into the series but those who are will eat it up please keep it going legendary  wb
Mar 30 2024,positive,never had so much fun in a theater
Mar 30 2024,positive,if youre a fan of the monster verse and love a roller coaster of a movie youll love it if you came for a godzilla minus one type of cinema with context galore stay at home this isnt for you
Mar 30 2024,negative,should have been named kong x godzilla  big g was nothing more than a supporting role  great action and cgi but far from coming anywhere close to what godzilla minus one gave us
Mar 30 2024,positive,my 13 year old son  i loved the movie its godzilla  king kong which makes it great to start with   it was a great plot action packed  great effects
Mar 30 2024,positive,entertaining and fun
Mar 30 2024,positive,the storyline was easy to understand and follow
Mar 30 2024,positive,came in wanting lots of fun monster action and thats exactly what you get
Mar 30 2024,positive,the movie is absolute fun and mayhem i loved it i think any avid godzilla fan would enjoy its battles and thrills
Mar 30 2024,positive,awesome movie lots of titan action and just enough human interaction funny and visually gorgeous highly recommend
Mar 30 2024,positive,godzilla x kong was almost a perfect homage to the old era of goofy kaiju movies it was simultaneously ridiculous and awesome was pretty wellpaced and did a better job of focusing on the stars of the show the monsters than some past monsterverse movies  it certainly wasnt without faults but i was able to eyeroll and move on from them pretty quickly not much of a plot but i paid to see monsters fight and it really delivered there and honestly if you went into this expecting a really solid plot come on you knew better really glad i saw it in the theater for the full experience
Mar 30 2024,positive,it kept me entertained just way too many stories in one movie going on
Mar 30 2024,positive,i loved the movie it was amazing
Mar 30 2024,positive,this was the first titan movie that actually flowed and made sense
Mar 30 2024,positive,enjoyed and very well done
Mar 30 2024,positive,i had my doubts but i loved this movie saw it in 3d got right to the action
Mar 30 2024,positive,great movie definitely a must see
Mar 30 2024,positive,loved it not overly long chock loaded with monster action and minimal human sidestory
Mar 30 2024,positive,if you are a true fan this is a fun and creative movie godzilla fans and kong fans will love it
Mar 30 2024,positive,glad they give the kaijus more screen time
Mar 30 2024,positive,my wife and i enjoy the movie the fighting scenes were great the story was okay   the movie was worth the money for me 
Mar 30 2024,negative,not too ago i got to watched godzilla minus one  what a fabulous movie now that ive watched godzilla x kong i felt so disappointed it is not made for adults it felt more like a kids movie it felt choppy incomplete ridiculously childish i actually felt a little betrayed  too long with the humans boring  not enough godzilla time humanizing the kaju monsters was not entertaining  scar king was so silly he was like an aging rockstar dumb ill never watch it again this felt more like a parody
Mar 30 2024,positive,long time fan of all the 3 monsters this movie stretches the bound of even my imagination i saw it in 3d which must have made a huge difference but still it fell short of my expectations  godzilla sleeping in the roman colosseum kong not king kong with an artificial tooth and prosthetic hand there was certainly a lot of action and the cinematography and special effects were mesmerizing but the plot was pretty thin i still cant get accustomed to kong walking around upright like a human or the absence of godzillas haunting iconic roar the movie can be summed up for me like a ride on a roller coaster it was exciting but once the ride  stops easily forgettable
Mar 30 2024,positive,godzilla helped king kong against monster enemiesgreat special effectsgo see it
Mar 30 2024,positive,went to see it in 4dx made it really better if i were to watch it normal then i would say its still a great movie to watch with the family not that many boring parts
Mar 30 2024,positive,definitely a fun movie the soundtrack was an 80s throwback vibe the movie continues the story of the previous films well with only a few minor dull spots
Mar 30 2024,positive,the movie was outsanding everything about it was just amazing even for the kids they need to make more like this like back in the old days when they would fight other monsters and team up
Mar 30 2024,positive,why you go to the movies
Mar 30 2024,positive,i love this movie 10 out 10
Mar 30 2024,positive,i just dont understand how people cant always enjoy the fact that we got two godzilla movies back to back and for some reason people always compare them when theyre literally two different sub genres one comical and the other horror
Mar 30 2024,positive,my favorite one so far
Mar 30 2024,positive,lots of cool action and great cgi i like how mothra came back
Mar 30 2024,positive,the previous monsterverse movies mostly showed drama between the humans but this movie showed kaiju action even more than the humans it kept me hooked throughout the entire movie and the build up to the final battle was intense godzilla evolving king and suko finding skar kings lair and skar king and shimo putting their focus onto godzilla and kong who team up after mothras message the fight was thrilling and fun to watch and see skar king get tossed around
Mar 30 2024,positive,as a life long godzilla fan who adored the direction of the monstervers and a massive fan of the heisei era films and some of the showa era films godzilla x kong the new empire is a mere callback to the showa and heisei era with its goofy moments fun frantic colourful action and badass monster designs that is more than enough to bring out a childish giggle this movie is proof that godzilla can be both serious and well not so serious  the movie does an excellent job at making the monsters not just mindless gargantuan sized excuses for impressive cgi but actual characters most notably kong kongs arc in this movie is amazing facing realistic struggles some people face such as losing the ones you love or standing up to those who dont have a say godzilla on the other hand while he only makes up for around 89 minutes of the movie but in every scene he is in oh boy he is on fire godzilla is an absolute savage in this movie showing others his sheer power and how unstoppable he is but my only complaint is that despite being the title character hes not really in the movie that much and he doesnt have the most impressive story arc another complaint i have is that the movie runs incredibly quickly almost too quickly i dont usually have a problem with this except the movie doesnt have much time to breathe and as result certain scenes dont feel as impactful or memorable also tom holkenburgs score is meh its not really memorable and it feels like holkenburg isnt really sure what type of scene he is trying to convey although it is nice to see certain themes return so a point for consistency   in sum up godzilla x kong the new empire is fast frantic and colourful and a reminder to certain people that not every godzilla film has to be a godzilla minus one clone but of course its not for everyone    good movie great movie 810
Mar 30 2024,positive,godzilla x kong fantstic movie emotional monster fights galore all incredible
Mar 30 2024,positive,whatever you do do not listen to the critics this movie is a great monster movie with a ton of battles and action but the critics are criticizing it for that like what this is what a monster movie is supposed to be this movie is very entertaining and worth the watch
Mar 30 2024,positive,i dont understand the official critics rating it so low this was really good second to minus one   i am giving it a 5rated
Mar 30 2024,positive,the action in this movie is amazing godzilla going super saiyan and kong looking like god of war great movie  i havent enjoyed a movie like this since end game 
Mar 30 2024,neutral,you dont go to this for a story line but to see godzilla  kong in action and it definitely delivered on that  i enjoyed it good entertainment
Mar 30 2024,positive,godzilla x king kong new empire did it again the cgi story and visuals are awesome ignore dumb critics saying this is an unrealistic size emotionally who dfq cares its a movie about a kaiju fighting another kaiju to survive in an unrealistic world anyways for kaiju fans who love destruction it sure did deliver this franchise will be forever engraved in my heart
Mar 30 2024,positive,only for godzilla do more of him dont focus more on people friendship or the small girl that why shin godzilla japan version is always better
Mar 30 2024,positive,loveddd it cant wait for the next
Mar 30 2024,positive,movie was good but godzilla in this movie doesnt looks as realistic compared to the godzilla in  godzillaone  its a much better movie 
Mar 30 2024,positive,this is the kind of movie that you would regret not watching in the theatres it is not going to be deep and moving like most of the oscarnominated movies but it will surely be more enjoyable than most of them must watch
Mar 30 2024,positive,monsterverse is the great plan to watch godzilla the best kaiju ever
Mar 30 2024,positive,super enjoyable with weird pacing issues but as a godzilla fan its super fun
Mar 30 2024,positive,great monster action with less focus on the humans
Mar 30 2024,positive,its not minus 1 with that out of the way  for a monster focused movie it was awesome sometimes you just want to see monsters kicking the snot out of each other and this movie delivers in spades the fights are incredible   this is a saturday afternoon matinee movie that brings you back to your childhood but with more believable effects  having mothra back was the best part not really a big fan of the bug but the legendary version is incredible and leaves me wanting more she could easily have a great solo film  if you want a great human drama this is not it but if you want to have fun and feel like youre a kid again for 2 hours grab a big bucket of popcorn sit in the center and prepare for a hell of a show
Mar 30 2024,positive,thought it was a very interesting creative choice for kong to say may thy knife chip and shatter to the skar king before the big climactic fight
Mar 30 2024,positive,you knew what this was and it was great at it
Mar 30 2024,positive,excellent show with tons of action  7080 of film time contained godzilla or king kong  my 20 yo son agreed that it was the best gozilla movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,the humandialogue scenes have been significantly reduced while the monsteraction scenes have increased making gxk perform excellently and satisfyingly in terms of special effects and action sequences to some extent it also carries the flavour of pacific rim uprising while the subplot on the kong side gives a feeling reminiscent of the early rise of the planet of the apes however unfortunately occasionally inserted humandialogue scenes sometimes disrupt the overall rhythm if in the future humans could truly take an observers perspective on everything happening in the monster universe then perhaps movies purely driven by titans could reach the most ideal level
Mar 30 2024,positive,kinda wish godzilla was in it more felt like kong feat godzilla but dont get me wrong its a fun fun movie and every scene godzilla is in is terrific movie is a ton of fun
Mar 30 2024,positive,great fight scenesonly down part is to much focused on the humans
Mar 30 2024,positive,the plot is paper thin but with monster filmswho really cares the visual effects is unmatched compared to the other legendary monster films a vibrant and striking colors that pops gone are the days of dark battles at night 95 of the film is during the daytime and each monster sports a different color palette that contrasts strongly with the environments for easier eye tracking during fights easily my favorite monsterverse film to date from legendary
Mar 30 2024,positive,solid action from start to finish 
Mar 30 2024,positive,plenty of action much more entertaining than godzilla vs kong 
Mar 30 2024,positive,i think its a great movie better than the first with more epic scenes more characters
Mar 30 2024,positive,fun and exciting monster flick
Mar 30 2024,positive,human stuff was lacking a bit but the monsters were amazing their characters really shined through in this one vfx were great and some very creative visuals that had real weight to them loved the music had a blast watching it will see it again
Mar 30 2024,negative,very predictable   the human story little girl mommy silly friends its very boring hollywood style
Mar 30 2024,positive,this movie has so much action even from the start of the movie godzilla x kong is a must watch
Mar 30 2024,positive,its giant monsters smashing each other in the face thats why we go to the movies
Mar 30 2024,positive,fantasy at its best youre transported to a new world where titans exist you get to see your favorite childhood monsters become good guys coming to save the day it was non stop entertainment the acting was top notch fun to watch for the whole family loved it
Mar 30 2024,positive,easily one of the best monsterverse movie it is purely made for kaiju fans
Mar 30 2024,negative,the story was good all management teams have done their part to excel the movie except for the sound department godzila nd the othr titans scream was like they cold the gorging was very low bad very bad please update the sound on the titans ppl will enjoy the movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,the movie is good but the ending seems rushed but if youre looking for full action pack monster movie then this is for you  i hope they make a new movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,love the enhanced graphics animation and a whole lot of monster fight scene which is what everyone wants to see love it
Mar 30 2024,positive,as a monster verse fan i loved it but i do think they could have improved on some of but like how long the fights were some are very forgettable because of how short they are but regardless i still loved this movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,amazing all the kaiju action youd want this loses half a star  because ironically enough godzilla didnt appear as much still  had a fun time with kong traversing around hollow earth and it was pretty epic if not low stakes finale great stuff
Mar 30 2024,positive,this move is great you want to go to a movie and just enjoy yourself then just go see it kong is great and basically is the film and i am good with that
Mar 30 2024,positive,this is a great movie with excellent special effects made for the fans by the fans
Mar 30 2024,positive,brilliant i had an amazing time with this one in 3dall sorts of whoop a and monsters fighting monsters from start to finish  i love kong and this was his most bada version  its probably my favourite monster movie to date my grandson loved it 
Mar 30 2024,positive,entertaining but the acting is underwhelming the plot is pretty simple more of a movie for kids the monarch series on apple tv was much better special effects were very good though come a long way from the 70s with monster movies cgi way better than rubber suits lol
Mar 30 2024,positive,loved it i was screaming yelling of joy 
Mar 30 2024,positive,a great movie the effects the fights the designs the monsters the style everything is great  godzilla x kong the new empire
Mar 30 2024,positive,some people are comparing this to godzilla minus 1 dont do that you cant do that these are two godzilla films that are not related to each other at all     godzilla x kong is pure entertainment and monster madness lighten up calm down and just enjoy the damn ride its really for your kids not you this movie wasnt made to win awards it was made to entertain
Mar 30 2024,positive,the movie was grrrrreat but theres to much human parts in the moviegodzilla was a menace exploding scylla into piecesripping titanas tiamat apartturning extra powerfulbashing kong into a peramidjumping off a peramid he was just badasskong was mid suko was nice addition mrclean scarkingwas boring and midbut shimo is like a giant pitbull at the end 8510  whould recommend
Mar 30 2024,positive,ignore the negative reviews of the critics  this was the best entry in the monsterverse the amount of emotional storytelling they were able to create from the monsters themselves was fantastic  i was surprised by how often i laughed and teared up from both the monsters and the human characters for the first timein this series i was not completely annoyed by the human characters  rebecca hall elevated her role from mere exposition and i loved her arc with jia  dan stevens was hilarious  soku was a pleasant additionso emotive  scar king was terrifying young children were crying  the heart of the film is kong and his story was compelling the action was at times bombastic but handled with humor  godzillas supporting storyline and fights were slightly too quick but effective i will for sure be seeing this again
Mar 30 2024,positive,this is no human drama boring story line its an action packed epic fight scenes 90 of the time  they listened to what real godzilla fans wanted and they delivered my only complaint is it wasnt long enough
Mar 30 2024,positive,great i honestly think that if you go into this thinking its going to be on the same level as minus one you have no right to even try and critique a movie its a fun action packed adventure its not meant to be a engaging emotional rollercoaster  i loved it i love godzilla and other kaiju filmsthings it is better than the previous two monstervers installments  vfx 910  story 7510  characters 7510 cinematography 9510
Mar 30 2024,positive,my family and i really enjoyed the movie funny scenes intense action wow it has it all
Mar 30 2024,positive,amazing visual affects and story telling in the movie last 30 mins by far the best and would have liked to see more of evolved godzilla but all in all my favorite monsterverse installment yet
Mar 30 2024,positive,i love it we need monsterverse
Mar 30 2024,positive,it is a great movie paying tribute to some of those showa era movies it also had great and emotional moments in this bro they were pulling wrestling moves highly recommend
Mar 30 2024,positive,this is a great addition to the franchise
Mar 30 2024,positive,the movie is a good monster movie go see it
Mar 30 2024,positive,love this movie but i feel like godzilla movies should be longer to many fights to just last 30 seconds i love godzilla am huge godzilla fan but king mosters still top tear especially cause of how you feel how big they are now fee like am the height of godzilla or kong i think cgi should be better still enjoyed but i think this movie should go in a way pacific rim goes on or transformers if they wanna make hollow earth work but i love this movie 9510 not best but feel should played out diff i know godzilla wanna go beat titamut and scylla but i dont think fights should last 30 to 1 min fights estheir way still enjoyed it but you wanna add many fights to movies maybe next movie for  godzilla or kong make it 2 to 3 hours long and add more godzilla background not just king kong back story and how he just keep trying to reunited to his family but overall loved it but yeah those i think trought me off like make them as mosters not like humans but still let me interact but not as humans make it feel more realistic over all good movie loved it
Mar 30 2024,positive,the special effects in this movie were amazing making it so much fun to watch full of action with a very cool cast of strange characters and species
Mar 30 2024,positive,the movie itself is a blast when it comes to fun and kaiju fights not even the parts with humans bothered me because of the expansion of the lore they add this movie is great and kong is better than ever
Mar 30 2024,positive,the effects were good but the plot was weak
Mar 30 2024,positive,fun monster action with a serviceable human plot we got minus one to give the serious side of godzilla and this film to give the goofy monster action great time for kaiju fans
Mar 30 2024,positive,this movie isnt as serious as godzilla minus one but the action scenes and colorful visuals are absolutely incredible every true godzillaxkong fan admires this film for giving us this justice league team up we got the best zilla  kong villain of all time skar   skar king is truly a tremendous villain without even saying any words simon was awesome to witness aswell
Mar 30 2024,positive,godzilla x kong the new empire is all you need for a good kaiju movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,this movie was so good just the right amount of action and we got to see three new kaiju which was amazing plus theres just a little more emotions in the titans and kong gets his respect plus godzilla is even more cool in this and i really like kongs upgrades same as godzillas plus shimo is a absolute beast skar king is too and suko is a funny little  and dougs even in it1010 for those who havent seen it go watch it plus even if your bored and dont know what to see this movie would be good
Mar 30 2024,positive,godzilla x kong the new empire lacks the strong human drama from godzilla minus one but as a second crowdpleasing blockbuster featuring 2 of cinemas most iconic monsters it gives exactly what it promises with exciting results
Mar 30 2024,negative,after godzilla minus one this is an embarrassment not just for america but the franchise     it was a pro wrestling match most of the movie if you even wanna call it that    after this movie bombs wait for godzilla minus one to comeback to theaters and support an zing godzilla movie this was trash
Mar 30 2024,positive,great action the main street critics suck
Mar 30 2024,positive,i truly appreciate this movie it was an amazing movie that gave us what we fans wanted which was a monster brawl to a point that we were screaming in the theater go watch this move for the monster action and the destruction
Mar 30 2024,positive,a lot of fun   the human plot line not so much but thats not what the monster verse movies are about i would say this movie did what it set out to do and thats to be a fun monster movie that pays its dues to some old school godzilla clasics i loved it 
Mar 30 2024,positive,godzilla wanted all the smoke bro
Mar 30 2024,positive,this rendition of godzilla and kong has great action graphicalsound effects and mystery elements the aspect of kong is especially treated well and would please many kong fans more humane side of g and k are shown sprinkled comedy from the titans provides a surreal storytelling with the great 3d animations
Mar 30 2024,positive,the movie is a great movie and full of adventure just my problem shouldve made skar king a little more scary but other than that the movie was amazing and awesome recommend to see on the biggest screen possible
Mar 30 2024,positive,an unapologetic throwback to the showa era films that inspired it godzilla x kong the new empire is 115 minutes of pure fun and another strong outing to commemorate 10 years of the monsterverse
Mar 30 2024,positive,kong is king and godzilla is a menace i love this film
Mar 30 2024,positive,excellent movie good than the others kong godzilla movies
Mar 30 2024,positive,its ok but focus on the humans and not much of a improvement on the orginal also there size seems to change as needed
Mar 30 2024,positive,a 3hr movie condensed into under 2hr an awesome kaiju movie with underlying themes of oppression family and teamwork cgi looked okay at times and great when it matters i was absolutely sold on this movie after the intro credits and title screen great way to grab the viewers attention and satisfy longtime fans not a perfect movie human elements are getting better but still need a little work slight pacing issues and certain camera shots literally made cringe however i thoroughly enjoyed this movie best entry into the monsterverse
Mar 30 2024,positive,it is just what i wanted to see lots of monster fighting fun and exciting it did not dissapoint
Mar 30 2024,positive,it took a long time to get through the plot of the movie it felt like they make the movie way longer than it shouldve been
Mar 30 2024,positive,the movie was fun and the fights were the best in the monsterverse so far i enjoyed all the monster fight scenes in the movie it is the best attribute of the movie however the final fight were shorter than what i would want to they could have extended the fight shimo could have more potential than what we got i hope they would make more sequel with this level of choreography in fights    regarding the story it is average and some aspects of it are just there for the sake of the story the story may not be its strongest attribute
Mar 30 2024,positive,loved the 3d and the ending
Mar 30 2024,positive,absolutely amazing kong taking the lead as a main character gave a new and fresh look into the monsterverse but not to mention the main antagonist of the film was amazing also would recommend seeing on the biggest screen possible definitely my favorite movie of this year
Mar 30 2024,positive,does its job well it builds the kong mythos much more than godzilla and thats not a a bad thing
Mar 30 2024,positive,this movie is the best movie in the monsterverse this movie has it all extreme monster action likeable human characters and the monsters are actually treated like real characters diehard fans of the monsterverse will also love this flim as it introduces titans from the graphic novels great new world building and lore is introduced in this film this movie is a great time at the movies and is most definitely worth a watch for fans and general audiences alike teamgodzilla
Mar 30 2024,positive,do not listen to the corrupt reviewers at rotten tomatoes always looking for the next endgame or avatar  of a decade i liked this movie it wasnt the best but its beautiful and i really enjoyed it you dont always have to be beating on movies because they arent how you want them to be maybe get less biased critics
Mar 30 2024,positive,this movie is what i expected good monster mayhem with some truly amazing creature characters the one con for me was the usage of a certain insect kaiju but the rest was golden and exciting overall the one con doesnt deserve to take down a whole star  and shimo was an amazing original character with a lot of depth of you look for it with familial themes and touches of loyalty and nonfamikial bonds i give this movie a 55 go gxk
Mar 30 2024,positive,loved it all i went back for a second showing it seemed a bit darker but i still enjoyed it the writer did very well writing it im a kong and godzilla fan i cant wait for the next chapter
Mar 30 2024,positive,definitely a good watch with exciting scenes didnt find any boring bits and the movie wasnt too long and just right a must watch at the movies
Mar 30 2024,positive,great godzilla movie and great actions dont listen to the critics and watch the movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,this movie served its purpose being an absolute thrill ride and plenty of jaw dropping action ive read some of professional reviews on the critic side and all i can say is this yall need to get laid and watch that movie with a boyfriend or girlfriend and not just by yourself like you usually would
Mar 30 2024,positive,the best movie so far
Mar 30 2024,positive,highly action packed movie with great cgi  fun battle scenes i personally loved the story  ending as a long time godzilla fan both old  new i approve
Mar 30 2024,positive,what did i just witness this was the most ridiculous high scale spectacle in recent memory seeing these legendary creatures fight wwe style was something else i would be lying if i said i didnt have fun though this was a very fun movie with the maximum amount of cgi possible i will say that the human aspect of this movie was bad it took me out nearly every time there was much human interaction besides bernie and trapper i really liked the world building in hollow earth and i also liked that they focused on kong and his everyday life alone but i really wanted more godzilla he didnt get nearly enough screen time i also wished they would have spent more time with our villains scar and shimu this honestly could have had zero human characters and that would have made it 20 better
Mar 30 2024,positive,the movie was great the right amount of action
Mar 30 2024,positive,for being a godzilla fan this movie meant very personal to me being a fan of kaijus and the monsterverse is awesome it keeps bringing the kid out of me     its not for everybody but if you guys are looking for a good family friends or partner timemovie this would be a an amazing pop corn movie    flaws will be there in these types of movies except minus one cause it needs to focus on its main characters the monsters but this is not an oscar movie its a fun and entertaining movie and it did its job in an amazing way these movies are like ice cream everyone has their own favorites and preferences    plus its always good to see kaijus rather than the ever fatigue of superhero movies and another thing i side with animals and monsters that are amazing to watch in imax it sucks to waste money on a ticket just for you to see fellow human beings that are toxic its way way better to see fantasy or scifi movies that revolve around kaijus or mechas        i love godzilla mothra  king kong
Mar 30 2024,positive,this movie is the type you dont go to for complex emotional moments or a detailed storyline we wanna see cool monsters fights that are visually spectacular and well choreographed if the movie does that then its done a good job
Mar 30 2024,positive,the best titan movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,the film is good but the human scenes are so boring and godzilla doesnt appear much including mothra who is beautiful the scenes in brazil werent in brazil you can tell i hated it
Mar 30 2024,negative,gxk was even more low effort than gvk things just happen no character no story nothing but hollow spectacle that could have been a short video on youtube
Mar 30 2024,positive,for me its actually a fun ride with some monsters brawling with each other but of course i cant compare it to g1 because both are different in their respected perspectivebut as long we stop comparing like those stupid critics do we can enjoy it morewhen we put aside our logics aside and enjoy it as normal audience it was a great experiencefor me its worth itso the critics can go cry for their selves
Mar 30 2024,positive,this was monsterverses avengers movie i have not had this much fun in the cinema in years this will go down as one of the most fun most majestic most explosive most enjoyable most rewatchable movie of all time
Mar 30 2024,positive,monterverse still a good movie good to see wwe between apes less godzilla scene
Mar 30 2024,positive,it was good enough to enjoy not the best but awesome
Mar 30 2024,positive,best movie of the monsterverse so far
Mar 30 2024,positive,an incredible monster movie amazing fights definetely the one all the kaiju fans were waiting for
Mar 30 2024,positive,after having seen godzilla minus one i was looking forward to godzilla x   kong i was not disappointed was it a great movie no but it was a great way to pass the afternoon
Mar 30 2024,positive,best movie ever and my favourite godzilla x kong the new empire film  100 i want to give this movie extra 5 stars  when i first watch this i got to excited but thank to all the actors to make this movie  best movie ever  but actually i want to give this 10 stars 
Mar 30 2024,positive,yesterday i watched godzilla x kong the new empire and this movie is good and has a lot of action so i recommend to watch it
Mar 30 2024,negative,the writers seemed to be hired straight from disney what a sad experience to a well awaited monster film godzilla minus one stands alone compared to these movies they put more importance in that little girls story than any of the monsters there was not one scene in that movie by the way where godzilla was scared lady in trailer is delusional the movie was just not good full of holes and bad writing they shouldve cut most of the scenes with the girl and the useless human interactions kong was the main charterer and they had godzilla co starring pathetic to the monsterverse sad
Mar 30 2024,positive,the best part was when godzilla did a wrestling move on kong 
Mar 30 2024,positive,best movie ever   me and my boyfriend enjoyed it 
Mar 30 2024,positive,if you love kaiju fights youll love this

Mar 30 2024,positive,as a fan of godzilla movies this is more than what i could of hoped for yes the plot and humans were not great but at this point i feel its known that thats how its going to be the monster verse films are about one thing and thats the kaju and their fights and boy did this film deliver on that big time some corny jokes were not funny and i definitely feel some parts an human characters could have been removed and made the film a bit better however going for the monster fights thats what i got great film and i will be seeing it again soon
Mar 30 2024,positive,godzilla another solid entry in this crazy ass series
Mar 30 2024,positive,did not disappoint it was like planet of the apes on steroids kong provides monster intellect godzilla has a new power color honestly  there is never enough godzilla scenes either way we enjoyed the movie as a family the final family poll is the story line was not boring or as my kids said not cringy everyone in the audience clapped at the end so thats always a plus and sign of good movie  we were entertained and look forward to more movies

Mar 30 2024,positive,truly fun and exciting super glad they focused more on the monsters my family enjoyed it
Mar 30 2024,positive,the storyline concept was interesting but completely different from all the other godzilla x king kong the bad toothpulling scene and many moments just like all the other apes in slaved by another ape  kind of a cheesy theme  king kong appeared to be too soft  overall i did think it was worth watching because my 6yearold daughter wanted to see it on her birthday as a present
Mar 30 2024,positive,action from the very start the greatest monsterverse movie to date
Mar 30 2024,positive,it was an epic power house of a movie the last 40 mins alone were some of the best action and kaiju fights i have seen and im a big fan of godzilla back in the day and this movie delivers definitely worth seeing on a big screen
Mar 30 2024,positive,best of the series 
Mar 30 2024,positive,the movie gives better insite to the background of kong and godzilla always a fan of both kong and godzilla along with all the other creatures that come and go throughout the godzilla series love the powerful connection between kong and the little girl that is now in her teens overall i am and always will be a fan

Mar 30 2024,positive,the best movie in the year
Mar 30 2024,positive,fun movie to watch  its a movie where humans dont count  are parent only to facilitate few plot points keep your thinking hat at home  enjoy the cgi slug fest
Mar 30 2024,positive,everything you could want out of a monster movie film saw it two times lets hope they keep this up with more monster verse content
Mar 30 2024,positive,overall it was a good movie but like every movie it has pros and cons  i think some of the battles were to quick but they were cool to watch when it did happen the big fights didnt technically start till like towards the middleend of the movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,i fought the movie was good i expected it to be a movie about monsters fighting and thats what i got
Mar 30 2024,positive,non stop fun the world needs more action like this
Mar 30 2024,positive,absolutely loved it one of the best monster films in a while glad i dont listen to the critics   and everyone clapped at the end of the film
Mar 30 2024,negative,laughably bad i had a moment about half way through were i realized that nothing was good about this movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,the 3d perspective was very entertaining  it was a good movie to see with the kiddos
Mar 30 2024,positive,this movie is so good from the reviews i expected this to be dumb fun but honestly no kong is the heart of this movie and shares such an emotional connection with the audience godzilla while yes indeed is sidelined he is sprinkled throughout the movie plenty of times that godzilla vs kong fight in egypt is one of my favorite fights of all time scar king in my opinion should have had more of a role but he is in my opinion still a decent baddie there are plenty of titans in this film as well i wont spoil them i do not know why but the humans are just good in this movie the others showed them as being just exposition but i honestly enjoy these humans and show some interest in them trapper is just the best character for a series like this and the motherdaughter plot is also pretty decent they also play an important role in the emergence of a surprise titan      this movie is made for theatres walk no run no sprint to see this movie at your nearest theatres it is worthwhile while the spoilers dont ruin it
Mar 30 2024,positive,the best movies in the whole monster verse by far everything is on point even the humans which are known to be the weakest link in these type of movies  spoiler ahead  making kong the protagonist was the best decision his interactions with jia are some of the best parts
Mar 30 2024,positive,when my husband said were going to see this i wasnt to excited cause im not an action movie fan i loved this movie i cried i laughed must watch
Mar 30 2024,positive,great movie watched at a 4dx movie theatre only thing i did not like was no ending credit scene orlead for the next movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,just a great movie for going out and having fun  no amazing plot just amazing fights and giant monsters battling
Mar 30 2024,positive,i thought it was great for i came to watch it forthe monster fights and im happy whit that
Mar 30 2024,positive,it was the most amazing and epic badass movie ever i love godzilla and kong are fighting together to stop scar king and mothra join in the battle in subterrean hollow earth
Mar 30 2024,positive,fight scenes are way too short
Mar 30 2024,positive,i loved it but im a sucker for anything with godzilla or kong in it lol
Mar 30 2024,positive,highly recommend you watch in 3d for best experience cgi was awesome tons of action which was exactly what i wanted if what you are looking for is monsters and destruction go watch and just have fun with it stop at dollar tree grab a soda and your snackysnacks and enjoy the ride
Mar 30 2024,positive,a little rushed and little to no human plot godzilla x kong the new empire brings everything a godzilla or kong fan could possibly want and need in a single film
Mar 30 2024,positive,its very good its like a modern shows godzilla film and there are so many kaiju and kaiju serpentine what a masterpiece chef kiss
Mar 30 2024,negative,ugly cgi and a plotless film make this a full watch
Mar 30 2024,positive,although it had some flaws its a really solid movie less human screen time and these humans actually arent as annoying as last movies action everywhere from start to end the best thing about this is that they told the story in the pov of the titans and not from human pov the visuals were downgraded for a bit its mainly because of a stricter and lower budget overall amazing movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,i love the story and the movie effects
Mar 30 2024,positive,i dont care what the credits are saying this movie was excellent i will be going back to watch it again oh and everyone in my theater was clapping
Mar 30 2024,positive,pure fun its one of the best just straight down action packed monster movies ive seen in a decade
Mar 30 2024,positive,this film was incredible start to finish its everything weve wanted from the monsterversethe character arcs are well structured and i love how some characters come full circle  the cgi and visuals were amazing and it was definitely fun to watchadam wingard definitely delivered with this film
Mar 30 2024,positive,loved it soo much godzilla was the best kong was so good he and suko teared me up heaps of  surprises and amazing fights please just sit back and enjoy 
Mar 30 2024,positive,one of the best of the franchise easily
Mar 30 2024,positive,it was amazing fantastic scenes high quality and the storyline was amazing but it was to short all things packed together i need to remember some scenes by rewatching give it 8 out of 10 dougs like dangerville march 2829 godzilla x kong the new empire
Mar 30 2024,positive,its a great movie ive only got 1 problem with it though its that mothra just basicly got summoned instead of hatching from a cocoon like in godzilla king of the monsters
Mar 30 2024,positive,from classic kaiju fans to action movie goers this movie hits all the right spots while the monster fights leave your inner child in awe and wonder its the interactions and silent dialog that stands out above any movie before it what many critics have missed will make this movie really rewatchable in that u can almost understand the titans talking to each other by their body language and eyes its very well done and deserves credit the human story which feels about half of the screen time with monsters on the other half moves a little to fast of a pace but satisfies the plot and even touches the heart strings a little the cast is easy to watch and dare i say fun monstrously fun ride from start to finish and very easy to sit back and enjoy
Mar 30 2024,positive,the show is good the action and cgi is great but there are some promblems but its okay from me
Mar 30 2024,positive,this movie was overall epic fun might be the wrestlemania of the monsterverse
Mar 30 2024,negative,godzilla looked stupid when he ran and had all thr pink kong looked even worse with the arm thing he had going on there was nothing good or memerable about this movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,i loved the movie even my kids which they cant sit still in the movie theater but today watching the big g they watched with awww and excitement thank you for making a good movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,enjoyed the movie lots of action
Mar 30 2024,positive,just came back from gxk 1010 movie on par with minus one
Mar 30 2024,positive,critics hates it cuz its not like minus one audience loves it because its not like minus one movie critics as usual proving their stupidity once again
Mar 30 2024,positive,5 out of 5 action action action
Mar 30 2024,positive,it is very thrilling in my opinion w movie and lots of action which is what i like definitely must go and watch it
Mar 30 2024,positive,its was visually beautiful the scenery was amazing the way the fight scenes were made me feel in awe i just wish the movie was longer it was really good
Mar 30 2024,positive,i finally watched godzilla and kong the new empire all i can say about the movie is that there are a lot of action scenes and that is the reason why it is worth watching the human storyline is not so much but i didnt pay much attention to that    the final battle is good but too rushed
Mar 30 2024,positive,its the best monster movie i ever seen movie got best visual effect  its so amazing to watch it on 3d
Mar 30 2024,positive,its really good and the way they make the movie is on perfect time overall i think this is the best movie in monsterverse franchise as well a solid 1010 it defies perfection and also human scenes are very good also same as the titan scenes but i really think godzilla needs more screentime this story mainly focus on kong and the past and also hollow earth i also recommend this with your children and with your family this is the best movie i have ever seen in my entire life
Mar 30 2024,positive,godzilla x kong the new empire totally delivers on the titan action however the human storyline is somewhat underwhelming which was expected if youre a kong fan youll have a blast he has plenty of screen time and many memorable moments as long as you dont go into this expecting godzilla minus one you should have a fun time 
Mar 30 2024,positive,absolutely stunning i need another movie godzilla was literally so cool and so was kong having them run side by side and all the epic fighting
Mar 30 2024,positive,i watch the movie and i like it sad to saw some spoiler in the net 2 hours of the movie is not enough
Mar 30 2024,positive,overall very good movie   the first half is a bit boring cuz its focusing on the human characters a bit more than godzilla and kong but the second half of the movie is what u want to watch  great fight scene and u literally get goosebumps multiple times watching them but the ending could hav been a bit better but overall a good movie   definitely worth the watch
Mar 30 2024,positive,alot of action and cool monsters peak movie
Mar 30 2024,neutral,make it look somewhat real next time
Mar 30 2024,positive,great action movie to the series
Mar 30 2024,negative,its as if the people who made this and the previous one never actually watched the first movie just trash
Mar 30 2024,positive,this movie was amazing the fight scenes were incredible human story was solidjust incredible wish it was a little bit longer screw rt
Mar 30 2024,positive,amazing from start to finish
Mar 30 2024,positive,i want to start off by saying ive been a diehard godzilla fan since i was a little kid i feel like the majority of the bad reviews are due to some people comparing this movie to godzilla minus one which is completely unfair they have very different goals in mind   dont let the bad reviews fool you godzilla x kong the new empire is a blast i wont give spoilers but lets just say this movie offers sooo much theres alot that adam wingard added to this movie now im more of a godzilla fan over kong even though godzilla wasnt on screen as much as kong his presence on screen is honestly perfection every time speaking of kong the new approach to story telling with the titans pov works beautifully for kong the eotions expressed the body language not a single word is said during these moments but its like you still understand what their saying the relationship between kong and the other apes pull on your heart strings the fight scenes are unreal flashy blow for blow i personally feel like adam wingard struck a perfect balance between the human characters and titans in this movie theyre never on screen long enough to bore you theyre there for exposition giving us context of what going on then bam right back to monster action  its a must watch
Mar 30 2024,positive,its stupid but really fun all in one  the story and and the human element of the film is not good  but youre watching gxk not shakespeare  the monster stuff is amazing great fight screens loads of monsters so much fun  
Mar 30 2024,positive,my least favorite of the franchise  the loss of scale with kong in the hollow earth is immensely immersion breaking making me feel as if i was watching planet of the apes instead of a kaiju movie godzilla was barely in the movie and with his scenes lacking the impact of 2014 his absence is blaring and far too annoying  this is a kong movie with special guest godzilla   thankfully the human characters are less annoying than they were in gvk taking more a side role to kong this time but unfortunately with too much exposition
Mar 30 2024,positive,reminds me of the showa era of godzilla the human scenes are still not interesting but the monster action is amazing if you care about the monsters and not the human plot youll love this film
Mar 30 2024,positive,i loved the movie it was everything my childhood wanted in a godzilla movie and then some i hope to see more godzilla movies like this one
Mar 30 2024,positive,excellent movie with a lot of fights scenes and especial effects destructions everythings is great
Mar 30 2024,positive,pure awesomeness kaiju fight as what a monsterverse should be the cgi is top notch
Mar 30 2024,positive,i attended the first premier showing with only 10 others in the audience  of course its all about the kaiju and that was fun the monster scenes were kickass and enjoyable some of the music surprised me as it was from the 70s my generation  imo it mainly felt like a kong movie with guest star godzilla  i didnt care for that i would have liked to have seen more of big g he is badass as always there is a beloved special guest kaiju star but missing an important part that always goes with that guest star in every kaiju movie it appeared in i guess adam wingard didnt realize that or budget bs it felt like a big mistake  speaking of big mistakes i wont say any spoilers here but there are a couple of major plot points with kong injuries that are overly preposterous those couple of major plot points cant be developed in such a quick time they showed  i guess adam wingard wants us all to just grin and bear it and go onto the next fight hopefully  overall it was ok i give this dumb fun  a c for effort  give me toho kaiju anytime not related to the usa
Mar 30 2024,positive,i liked it so much there was some good action parts and funny scenes in the movie its a must watch
Mar 30 2024,positive,i loved it the movie was great
Mar 30 2024,positive,the movie was good but it kind of felt like it lasted 30 minutes theres not to much story involved the kong goes to scar king lair gets its ass beat and then goes up to surface to get godzilla to fight with him against scar king and shimo and thats it i also dont like how they made kong so weak in this monsterverse series he almost always needs help or relies on luck when he fights other monsters he should easily defeat the alpha skullcrawler and i dont think he should be that psychically weaker against godzilla the only edge that godzilla has over kong is his atomic heat beam if he didnt have that then i think that kong should have been stronger than him and why there isnt post credit scene
Mar 30 2024,positive,excellent follow up to godzilla vs kong fast paced with good action nothing ground breaking in terms of story line expected tropes and setup but still monster madness they introduce a couple new and old friends that make the story interesting overall fun movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,good movie graphics great did not disappoint
Mar 30 2024,positive,this movie was fucking peak from start to finish  freak what the critics are saying cus this movie was incredible  i fucking love this movie ik people are gonna compare it to godzilla1 but i love how that one takes itself seriously and this one is like a dumb fun ride adventures with the monster we can enjoy both of the worlds of 1 goji and gxk goji
Mar 30 2024,positive,godzilla x kong the new empire was a good movie i dont think its the best of the franchise it definitely is appealed toward family friendly and theres nothing wrong with that opens well slows down and then once the legs start running it doesnt stop for what its worth its an adventure with a lot in such a short amount of time what i mean is once the fighting and the monsters start getting deep into it it doesnt slow down so it can be hard to take away certain parts from the movie overall the cast was good you had a decent human side but the monsters were the main characters it would have been nice to see more godzilla but it was more meant for kong and his journey to finding family its a fun movie and i think you should see it a couple of times its definitely a different tone to the franchise
Mar 30 2024,positive,let me just start by sayingthis is a godzilla movie if you are looking for a compelling human story you are in the wrong place this movie is full of action definitely more towards the silly end and of things but i left saying this was my favorite of the monsterverse movies definitely felt like a nod to the showa era of godzilla definitely recommend 
Mar 30 2024,positive,this is for the fans
Mar 30 2024,positive,magnificent movie a love letter to the showa era
Mar 30 2024,positive,pros   lots of monster action  vibrant colours  well lit scenes  kaiju fun if you come with your brain off    cons  pacing was fast almost too fast final fight suffered from it  big bads monster design  story was meh
Mar 30 2024,positive,mediocre special effects provided by monsterverse maybe a new storyline but not much has changed some amazing action but confusing there were several instances of small chimps against apes apes against reptiles apes against lizards and lizards against leviathans these are now joined by an ape against an ape a moth against a lizard and a lizard against another ape these were all extremely farcical but they will eventually amuse kids if you guys have the nerve watch it however in my opinion its just a popcorn movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,good action storyline was a little cheesy
Mar 30 2024,positive,gojira is life kong is the man
Mar 30 2024,positive,no way ghidorahstan64 exist 
Mar 30 2024,positive,so far its not at minus one level but i did enjoy it i highly recommend it to all viewers
Mar 30 2024,negative,fans are easily blinded by the fact its a new addition to the monsterverse however the film is a sloppy mess its incredibly rushed and lacks any life the other films had to begin with the characters are dull and boring and the fight scenes are very short and dont even feel like fights the entire movie seemed to be just explaining a randomly thrown together lore to set up the ending which fell short with the maybe 2 minute fight scene the big bad was a rag doll and we never got to see his full potential before the movie ended nothing happened whatsoever except mothras unexplained return doesnt set up any future movies or has any real significance as the rushed film comes to a finale as a huge monsterverse and godzilla fan i left the theater board and honestly regretting watching it and thats coming from someone who loved gvk alright movie would recommend if youre board and need a way to kill 2 hours
Mar 30 2024,positive,excellent sequel with good storyline amusing and intense action
Mar 30 2024,positive,really liked it probably my most favorite monsterverse movie  the human character where actually enjoyable in this film the monsters showed some personality by body language and by their faces and the monsters fights are great just wanted more godzilla in this movie and some cgi doesnt look finished but it not enough for me to hate it or put it at a four start rating
Mar 30 2024,positive,its completely what i expected excellent action scenes from the perspective of the titans and leaving the humans aside a little bit my favorite monsterverse movie so far must watch
Mar 30 2024,positive,kong and godzilla amazing had fun with the fight scenes good movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,we came for giant monster fights and thats what we got i dont know what rotten tomatoes is on about but clearly dont know what the fans want cause this movie is great
Mar 30 2024,negative,the movie was great but the seats i reserved were not the seats i paid for
Mar 30 2024,positive,a genuine comedy with great kaiju fights sprinkled in at all the right times at times the previous monsterverse movies had a hard time juggling between human characters and monster fighting but godzilla x kong nailed the balance great new characters and a lot of development for kong as well its a must see
Mar 30 2024,positive,best movie from the monsterverse so far
Mar 30 2024,positive,great film if you love battling titans lots of action throughout the film and plenty of moments to really enjoy
Mar 30 2024,positive,great cgi good action and for once the human characters werent completely intolerable overall it gets the job done well and feels like the kaiju action that legendary seems to excel at
Mar 30 2024,positive,it was a fun time some good humour and great kaiju action there were a few things that i wish were covered more broadly but despite that it was overall a thoroughly enjoyable experience for anyone wanting giant monsters fighting if that is what you want to see then this is a film right up your alley
Mar 30 2024,negative,this movie lacked any explanation to what was going on it took a really big turn from the first 2 movies that were more serious and had more explanations to what was going on we didnt even get an explanation to what was shimu there was a big titan bridge that kong just walked over that is bigger than any titan they didnt explain the crystal that controlled shimu they didnt give us any flashbacks to what happened in the past with godzilla and scar king and the great war where did mothera even come from that just made no sense and also godzilla evolving in 3 minutes for what i say ghidorah was a bigger threat than that and the amount of people who died and no explanation to anything very dumb movie more like a avengers movie than a godzilla movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,loved every second of it
Mar 30 2024,positive,loved everything about it amazing 
Mar 30 2024,positive,loads of fun super entertaining and some sequences that made me clap whoop and holler  only downside was some minor plot holes but spending more time with the apes was worth it
Mar 30 2024,positive,i havent had this much fun at a movie since tropic thunder so glorious so comically over the top so wonderfully and powerfully cheesy and epic fun that when it was over i was laughing and smiling from ear to ear  i couldnt believe i saw what i just saw and it was obvious that those who made this movie loves this genre to see godzilla kong and mother on the screen together was a childhood dream to witness after watching the first trailer and seeing godzilla and kong sprinting towards their adversary together like william wallace in braveheart i knew i was in for a treat and it delovered i grew up on godzilla movies and im a huge fanand i crown this movie the best kaijumonster movie i have ever seen and ive seen many of them  i enjoyed it even more than godzilla minus one get into the spirit of it and youll have a blast
Mar 30 2024,positive,an awesome movie with adrenaline pumping actions
Mar 30 2024,positive,this movie is surprisingly so funny 
Mar 30 2024,neutral,it was a meh movie over looking the entigirl boss vib i dont there was a single man in any position of power when making a fantasy movie its best to keep at least some things close to reality so people can buy into the story i enjoyed the cgi most the acting was forgettable minus the very end i was ever so slightly moved when the girl wanted to stay with the mother
Mar 30 2024,negative,way too focused on the humans rather than the titans overall it seemed corny and a cash grab
Mar 30 2024,negative,worst cgi man come on its a multimillion dollar company do some work people like watching freaking ultraman
Mar 30 2024,positive,best movie ive seen in a while and any hater can go cry somewhere else cuz we dont even wanna hear about it lol ur not as important as you think lol 
Mar 30 2024,positive,the more i think about it after watching it the lower the rating i can give it
Mar 30 2024,positive,was literally amazing  loved every bit of the movie but i do wish theyd take it back to the godzilla of the 90s
Mar 30 2024,positive,godzilla x kong was exactly what i imagine nonstop kiaju action only complaint would be i wanted even more godzilla in the film but still as my son said after the movie ended that was the best movie ever
Mar 30 2024,positive,great special effects and not overly scary for young kids a great movie to watch once as an adult and probably several times if your a kid
Mar 30 2024,positive,its just big monsters beating the fuck out of each other make 56 more please and thank you
Mar 30 2024,positive,i feel like it was a lot of filler i think that when the movie is getting good its almost at the end i think it could have been a movie that without the filler would have lasted an hour or an hour and a half
Mar 30 2024,positive,loved the cgi but it was an okay script
Mar 30 2024,positive,its the dumbest movie that i will definitely watch again big monsters fighting makes my brain do a happy
Mar 30 2024,positive,was a great watch love the monster movies dont compare to minus one totally different the action was awesome
Mar 30 2024,positive,best movie to ever to ever exist i think it was very vibrant with colors funny and had titans have feelings like humans and the action packed fights were the best my favorite part was godzilla slamming kong wwe style right after he evolved
Mar 30 2024,positive,1010 id see it again the whole family had fun including me told my boys every godzilla movie is a little different and its just super fun to enjoy it kong is an incredible character to follow most of them are i cant wait for everyone to explore and discover the big reveals have fun this was great and imax only way to hear and feel it the visuals were very good too looked more photographed even though you knew it cant be but it adds to the texture of the film and i loved that the battles ensue and there are many its what weve been beeeeeeeeegging for with the legendary series and monarch now its time to eat it up like kong eating his latest conquest definitely hit this one up if youre a godzilla fan or even an early summer blockbuster fan
Mar 30 2024,positive,lots of monster action  good story line without too much people time  very entertaining great godzillaking kong movie

Mar 30 2024,positive,what more do you want titans everywhere fighting giant monsters fighting thats what were here for had a lot of fun
Mar 30 2024,positive,words cant describe how much i love these godzilla movies
Mar 30 2024,positive,this movie was fun and exciting the human element was better than the last two movies the monster fights is what we were asking for if you looking for shakespeare in a park this is not your movie however if you are looking for ground and pound and not much to think about you are going to like this
Mar 30 2024,positive,the movie was such a good time i loved the fights the campy stuff was charming as hech im seeing it again
Mar 30 2024,positive,this movie is a wild ride from start to finish this movie is heavily based on the monsters now and it is beautifully crafted not one second of this movie was i bored for the fans its a love letter for the general audience its a fun ride 10010
Mar 30 2024,positive,best godzilla movie from legendary so far it was an amazing movie i dont understand why people compare this to minus one but overall amazing movie you should go watch it if you havent already
Mar 30 2024,positive,my new favorite movie i loved the new kaiju shimu i didnt like that the movie was so short but the rest is a masterpiece
Mar 30 2024,positive,honestly just wish it was longer but it being short made graphics good im a godzilla fan but this movie made me rock with kong so heavy that boy was with all the smoke but loved it please monsterverse keep going
Mar 30 2024,positive,i love this movie because its what most of us are looking for see monsters fighting not boring humans fun to pass the time and i hope many people like it
Mar 30 2024,positive,this movie lived up to the hype it was amazing it was soo good that even the audience clapped as the movie ended for real is a must see
Mar 30 2024,positive,this was such a blast to watch sometimes you just need a simple movie about giant monsters smacking each other around loved it
Mar 30 2024,positive,best movie   i ever seen i would watch it again 10 out of 10 recommend
Mar 30 2024,positive,an excellent film highly recommended
Mar 30 2024,positive,tons of fun reminded me of old godzilla movies from the 60s and 70s
Mar 30 2024,positive,the audience is right about this one i dont think critics understand what people want to see when they go to a movie called godzilla x kong thankfully adam wingard does this is a fist pumping kaiju smack down and there isnt a dull  minute i watched it in the theatre with my 10 year old son and he could not stop jabbering about it for the car ride home it was a priceless experience
Mar 30 2024,positive,i think godzilla x kong the new empire was the best movie in the franchise my favorite part of the movie is when trapper dan stevens said try not to swallow your tongue
Mar 30 2024,positive,great graphics   great fight scenes   plot was good  however  the music didnt match the moment
Mar 30 2024,positive,the movie was a whole lot of fun think the wwe but with 300 ft monsters people in the theater were cheering well done
Mar 30 2024,positive,total insanity great fights funny 
Mar 30 2024,positive,fearsome godzilla has evolved this is the best movie ever fuck those critic 
Mar 30 2024,positive,the movie is a blast even more fun the second time i saw it its ridiculous as can be but its sincere theres a lot of long sequences where its just the titans and the nonverbal visual storytelling is just fantastic it wont be for everyone but i had myself a great time looking forward to seeing it a 3rd time
Mar 30 2024,positive,godzilla x kong is a cash grab for the monsters and rooting both kong and godzilla and this is the first time to filmed on imax and its huge to see huge monster in imax and i had a fun blast
Mar 30 2024,positive,godzilla x kong is an enjoyable movie to go into anticipating fun action packed monster scenes for 90 of the movie     human drama is kept to a minimum so you can truly enjoy the most out of a monster movie but the only downside is the movie is very fast paced and somewhat rushed at times but its the price to pay for constant monster action take the good with the bad and have fun
Mar 30 2024,positive,if you liked the previous monsterverse entries its definitely something to watch in imax but the story is convoluted and doesnt really explain itself very well godzilla takes a back seat in this one so if you are more of a kong fan this is more suited to you
Mar 30 2024,positive,i loved it it was amazing i cant wait for the next one just wish there was a little bit more godzilla and skar king time on screen but other then that it was amazing and it still is amazing
Mar 30 2024,positive,the movie was lots of fun to watch though the pacing felt a bit off regardless expect lots of action and spectacle
Mar 30 2024,positive,never a dull moment this one topped the last one for sure
Mar 30 2024,negative,godzilla needed more screen time  he was barely in the movie and it was pretty long
Mar 30 2024,negative,this is definitely one of if not the worst godzilla movies ever made 
Mar 30 2024,positive,great movie might have to go see it again
Mar 30 2024,positive,godzilla x kong the new empire is the type of movie i expected it to be i found it to be a mostly fun way to escape and have a good time at the movies i dont think it is fair that this movie is coming off the coattails of minus one which was flatout one of the best movies of 2023 i think if youve liked this series featuring godzilla and king kong this is a solid entry i think it is a bit slow to start because it focuses heavily on the human characters in the first half when the story shifts its focus to kong the movie becomes a lot more entertaining and the big finale is satisfying and very enjoyable overall despite some pacing issues  i think the movie is a good escapist blockbuster that will give fans what they want and is a solid crowdpleasing action movie that isnt meant to be taken too seriously
Mar 30 2024,positive,what a movie if youre wanting to watch a fun movie this is the one kong was such a loveable titan and you emotionally connect with him during this journey godzilla was a beast as usual especially in the new form two criticism i had was the fights shouldve been a lot longer even if it got the movie and extra 10 or so minutes also godzilla wasnt shown much throughout the movie he was just kinda  there and the humans were kinda boring but you dont see much of them overall though great cgi loveable characters and a worth watching movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,great movie featuring a lot of other titans besides kong and godzilla it was exciting entertaining and visually stunning from start to finish go see it
Mar 30 2024,positive,peak commercial entertainment starring kong and godzilla as action heroes human elements were not that great but better than the previous films but who cares if you were in for some kaiju level wrestling you will have a blast my only complaints were the duration of the final fight which is a bit short and godzilla should slow down i mean he is way too athletic for a 393 feet nuclear tank
Mar 30 2024,positive,loved the monster fights
Mar 30 2024,positive,excellent very good movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,great effedts and spectacular battle scenes story was a little week didnt care for the soundtrack
Mar 30 2024,positive,showed a human side to king and godzilla very touching
Mar 30 2024,positive,i love this movie great movie and i recommend a watch  i just wish the villan had more screen time and build up  towards the end things started going by a bit too fast i wish this movie was just a little longer  ill just have to wait for the next movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,i love this movie action pack kong and godzilla are beasts i cant wait until the next monsterverse movie installment
Mar 30 2024,positive,i had an absolute blast watching this movie they finally took the humans and put them to the side and let the monsters run the show but king kong was the star of this movie 100 and i loved that  this one is definitely worth a watch 
Mar 30 2024,positive,had so much action omggg i loved it sooo much
Mar 30 2024,positive,if youre a godzillakong fan this movie is for you  the fight scenes were out of this world will definitely see again and i hope we get more in this monsterverse

Mar 30 2024,positive,how humanlike kong is with his demeanor
Mar 30 2024,positive,i saw this exactly when it came out and whew i really wasnt too happy with the first trailer the second one was ok but the movie this movie is wayyyyyyyyy better than you think it is i thought this was the end of the monster verse nope this movie is incredible if anyone wants to see a movie during this time i would recommend this one if you havent seen it go see it now while it stays in imax
Mar 30 2024,positive,dont let the critics stop you from watching this film yes its flawed and has tons of this makes no sense scenese but this is an old school godzilla and kong vibe with updated cgi im not here to see oppenheimer this film delivers action heart fun and a fastmoving plot some great monsters a few surprises and some amazing sets if you love dumb monster fun like the old school godzilla movies see this
Mar 30 2024,positive,amazing movie delivered in everything expected a pure titan brawl if youre expecting some kind of thick emotional story driven plot this isnt the movie for you besides that this movie was so much fun the action between the titans is so well done
Mar 30 2024,positive,awesome movie fight scene was quick though
Mar 30 2024,positive,fantastic from start to finish what an epic team up godzilla  kong  pals at last well paced  and i must say they are wonderful actors 
Mar 30 2024,positive,extremely fun and enjoyable thrilling
Mar 30 2024,positive,good movie to turn off the brain
Mar 30 2024,positive,i really like monsterverse is amazing how they put all of those monsters together and fits so well 
Mar 30 2024,positive,an absolute insane fest of fun kaiju action
Mar 30 2024,positive,it was exactly what it needed to be fun frantic and action packed at this point you should know what youre coming to see and this movie delivered on all levels for me the human story was good enough for where we are at this point in the monsterverse skar king wasnt as tough as i thought he would be kong shined and godzilla was freaking godzilla ill be back next week
Mar 30 2024,positive,amazing movie a little flawed in writing but absolutely super fun
Mar 30 2024,positive,honestly so good when kong and godzilla pulled up together in that frame i got goosebumps and i started screaming lmfao
Mar 30 2024,positive,now were talking    splendid the way it presents all the fights between the monsters its fun and amazing to watch in imax the best of the saga simple as that
Mar 30 2024,positive,fun movie with cool new monsters theater i went to was almost full with everyone staying engaged with the movie after the movie ended it got a very nice round of applause been a long time since ive been to a movie where everyone was clapping bc they liked it again fun movie a great escape from reality for 2 hours  i hope they make a sequel
Mar 30 2024,positive,i thought it was a great movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,wow godzilla x kong the new empire was a thrill ride from start to finish ill have to watch it again to be sure but i think its my new favorite film in the monsterverse
Mar 30 2024,positive,great fun movie one of the best in the franchise more mosters less humans just what we want

Mar 30 2024,positive,it was a fantastic movie the best movie i haven see for a long time 
Mar 30 2024,positive,the entire storyline was phenomenal i loved the graphics i would give endless stars
Mar 30 2024,positive,the movie gives you exactly what you want and that is monster fights and action  there is a lot going on and a few cheesy elements but thats what makes it a fun take on classic showa era godzilla
Mar 30 2024,positive,this movie rocks
Mar 30 2024,positive,definitely the best in the whole franchise good characters and monsters bashing each others heads in what more could you need
Mar 30 2024,negative,worst one by far there was a lot of slow build up for a single fight that provided no challenge whatsoever plot felt like something written by a 5 year old it had no ups and downs nothing interesting human characters have gotten even more 1 dimensional the only thing the movie has going for it are a couple funny moments and some cool visuals overall the movie fails to provide a compelling story nor does it provide spectacular kaiju battles it provides a one sided smack down that is over quickly which was not worth sitting through hours of boring fluff without substance
Mar 30 2024,positive,this movie is truly a blast solid visuals compelling story giant monster fun and totally 80s coded with the music highly recommend
Mar 30 2024,positive,while the human parts arent great the final act of the movie more than delivers on its promise of kaiju action
Mar 30 2024,positive,i loved it it was really amazing i hope we see more of this type
Mar 30 2024,positive,review 
Mar 30 2024,positive,what fun  if you are a kaiju fan you will love it  critics have written that godzilla did not have any screen time i did not feel that way  i wish the film tied in the apple tv series and give mothra a better explanation after king of the monsters  but any way i had a very good time watching this
Mar 30 2024,positive,everything you want in a godzilla movie a must see for true fans
Mar 30 2024,positive,everything the monster fan wants to see
Mar 30 2024,positive,great movie action packed lots of titan action

Mar 30 2024,positive,big monsters fighting best one yet
Mar 30 2024,positive,i am not going to spoil this movie godzilla x kong the new empire for you guys you need to enjoy this movie the ending was so great for this perfecto
Mar 30 2024,positive,loved the whole movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,a great outing for kong its mostly his movie with some sprinkles of godzilla the film doesnt disappoint great fight scenes throughout and not an overwhelming pointless human story a throwback top tier blockbuster popcorn fun film
Mar 30 2024,positive,its more a kong film than a godzilla one some canon issues and the sound track is a bit too stranger thingsish  that said it was a fun fast paced film i could see rewatching several more times
Mar 30 2024,positive,omg the most fun i ever had with a godzillakong moviefor the first time everything is focused on them and no boring human story
Mar 30 2024,positive,fun movie to watch with the family
Mar 30 2024,positive,the monster sized fight scenes were quite enjoyable but the rest of the story much less so i went in with very low expectations so in that sense i enjoyed the fun but by the time the movie ended i was more than ready to go
Mar 30 2024,negative,i fell asleep   characters know things not because theyre intelligent but because the story needs to happen
Mar 30 2024,negative,not as good as the first kxg
Mar 30 2024,positive,exactly what i want to see in a monster movie people were good fights great love to see it
Mar 30 2024,positive,a must see action packed the best godzillakong movie yet
Mar 30 2024,negative,underwhelming too much plot filler
Mar 30 2024,positive,this movie gave me everything i wanted in a kaiju fight movie  i got action laughs action just enough human story and action  i am not going to this type of movie looking for epic dramatic acting i am wanting to escape in a fun over the top kaiju slugfest and this movie delivers on that
Mar 30 2024,positive,this is a movie where the main characters are the monsters themselves supported by the human characters  its an interesting take  and though you could easily dismiss the whole thing as silly  strangely enough its kind of moving  at least it answers the question of what would a movie be like if they could afford walltowall cgi and just let the monsters take over the movie  maybe its not enough story for everyone but its a lot of fun    load up on popcorn and enjoy  godzilla and kong are back
Mar 30 2024,positive,wonderfully stupid some really entertaining set pieces big fights loopy story biggest screen possible  its all about the big
Mar 30 2024,positive,the movie is good but the fight was short though i wanted to see more godzilla and scar king along side shimo they should have at least have scar king at the beginning of the film
Mar 30 2024,neutral,a big kids movie  action packed  90 monster
Mar 30 2024,positive,this is what theaters were made for 3d 4dx babyyy this movie isnt meant to change the world its meant to be crazy fun battling and pure vibes go in sit down and let your mind relax

Mar 30 2024,positive,awesome movie it is definitely a must see if you are a godzilla fan
Mar 30 2024,positive,if youve seen the trailer and youve seen godzilla vs kong you know what to expect its that but dialed to 11 thousand
Mar 30 2024,positive,i really enjoyed this one its better than the previous in my opinion
Mar 30 2024,positive,its fun the craziest in the monsterverse and has very epic moments the movie delivers what it promises and does it in a big way
Mar 30 2024,positive,great movie loved it

Mar 30 2024,positive,the movie was great so entertaining people think that this is minus one but were watching another type of movie for another type of audience so stop to compare i enjoyed it a lot and i loved it so so much long life to gojira and long live to the king kong

Mar 30 2024,positive,so good my family of 6 loved it age ranges 6 yr old65 yr old i loved the godzilla jumps  especially the frenemy dynamic 
Mar 30 2024,neutral,it was actionpacked packed but would have like to see more substance at the end
Mar 30 2024,positive,gxk was almost exactly everything i wanted and expected  a fun action packed monster throw down all over and under the earth the story is lite and although the stakes are high you never really feel it but lets face it we are here for godzilla and kong and their next adventure and this is where the movie gives the goosebumps my only complaint is that i would have loved more godzilla scenes but happy he was sprinkled in nicely between kongs story and the human story this is kongs movie with special guest star godzilla and the 3rd act and final fight is just a masterpiece of showastyle spectacular monster mayhem gfan from birth but kong has become my second favorite monsterkaiju since gvk im ready to see it again
Mar 30 2024,neutral,too cartoony for me
Mar 30 2024,positive,godzilla x kong is an awesome movie from the amazing fight scenes to the beautiful visuals this movie looks gorgeous kong was the heart of the movie and made the movie more emotional than i thought suko was a welcoming addition i didnt know i wanted and am now intrigued where he goes next while the humans were still the worst part i wasnt bored but rather interested each time they came on screen with very likable characters as well my main issues come from as a godzilla fan i wished he was there so much more and neither of the villains were not threateningdangerous enough to warrant both hero titans teaming up still this is a very enjoyable film and my favorite of this universe
Mar 30 2024,positive,this movie was so good its a must to go see especially in the movie theaters because if all the  colors that show up on the screen its seriously a action packed movie and highly recommend u to go watch it
Mar 30 2024,positive,for me it was the best godzilla  kong movie ever
Mar 30 2024,positive,great movie story was interesting fighting was good movie overall was very entertaining
Mar 30 2024,positive,that was nostalgic for me idk why
Mar 30 2024,positive,godzilla vs kong the new empire delivers jawdropping action sequences impressive special effects and an epic showdown between two iconic titans the film keeps you on the edge of your seat with its thrilling battles and visually stunning scenes making it a mustwatch
Mar 30 2024,positive,its amazing the godzilla is the king of all monsters the scenes took me up to the clouds
Mar 30 2024,positive,incredible movie everything i wanted it to be critics dont understand what this movie is its an absolute monster fighting sci fi blast and my favorite movie in the monsterverse franchise 1010
Mar 30 2024,positive,best one yet imo very entertaining my kids loved it
Mar 30 2024,positive,great movie from beginning to the end i hope they will make a sequel
Mar 30 2024,positive,if you love action this movie has it all great movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,its just something about a good old smash and scream godzilla movie solid movie of 2024
Mar 30 2024,negative,ive hardly ever disliked a godzilla movie only 1998 and shin but the monsterverse is starting to lose me with this installment its called godzilla and kong but godzilla really felt like an afterthought in this movie like hes kongs sidekick overall it was a good kaiju movie but there wouldnt be a monsterverse without godzilla
Mar 30 2024,positive,it was entertain good just a few conveniences
Mar 30 2024,positive,great action if you love godzilla for a godzilla kong movie like the story line
Mar 30 2024,positive,great fun movie to see with the family it delivered on what it set out to be which is a big monster mashup full of action and fan favorite monsters definitely recommend
Mar 30 2024,positive,movie hits the ground running no time wasted on building the story because we all know where we left off no over human element saturation great fight scenes and overall story coulda used more godzilla scenes but i get why there wasnt overall best movie of the modern movie era 2014 minus one is still the best ever made but this is top 3 for sure
Mar 30 2024,positive,the action and special effects were great
Mar 30 2024,positive,i loved this movie especially seeing it in imax the monster clashes really shine in the film as well as the visuals i hope they do more films
Mar 30 2024,positive,well im embarrassed to say i really enjoyed this the focus in this movie was pretty strictly on the monsters and the one relationship they have with a human and it worked also i quite enjoyed how the director destroyed all major tourist attractions in europe bravo
Mar 30 2024,positive,need more monster action
Mar 30 2024,positive,phenomenal monster fest couldnt be happier
Mar 30 2024,positive,its a full on saturday morning showa cartoon and the focas on the monsters is great  its so insane and so fun just let yourself have some fun
Mar 30 2024,positive,so at the last minute we decided that o go watch a movie and we chose this one the movie definitely was good and we are glad we went definitely worth watching again but in 3d there really wasnt anything that we disliked about the movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,good ole fashioned monster malee movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,it was an entertaining movie however the plot was fairly predictable there were some parts of the movie that seemed irrelevant godzilla did some things that seemed to not make himself more powerful or afford him any enhanced abilities
Mar 30 2024,positive,it was fun loud graphic somewhat predictable but fun
Mar 30 2024,positive,movie is amazing fights and monster moments are on point movie wasnt long and left me want more but strong overall my favorite monsterverse movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,easily a 810 a lot of people are going to compare this movie with 1 this isnt which and that is fine while 1 was more of disaster movie this is more an action adventure movie into the world of the kaijus with lots of fights for those that love kaiju movies this movie has lots of that and as for the humans element they there to mostly there to give context and some pov to this world if you love monster andor tons of crazy action sequences this movie is for you
Mar 30 2024,positive,awesome movie if youre a normal person like me and arent a film critic snob then you will enjoy this movie many film critics are a different crowd and seem utterly miserable whenever a kickass movie comes out again if youre a normal person who knows what fun is this movie is it
Mar 30 2024,positive,slow start but pleasantly great
Mar 30 2024,positive,i loved it great action and emotion and special characterswould definitely recommend
Mar 30 2024,positive,i did not like the ending was looking for more
Mar 30 2024,positive,if you dont understand what to expect at this point its your own fault embrace the awe and stupidity and just let it happen good vibes and monster be fighting
Mar 30 2024,positive,i loved everything about this movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,i enjoyed the movie but didnt like it overall i love that they are making things fun and interesting and more opportunities for the franchise to do which makes it unique to other franchises but it just went to goofy for me the pacing was fast the cgi and fight scenes were awesome love that kaijus got more screen time but i kinda prefer if they would keep the same tone like king of the monsters and gvsk atleast those movies were a good example of balance in goofy and a grounded feel to it the villian was not menacing at all hell mecha godzilla was more menacing than him and the movie was so predictable and cringe sometimes which is why im kinda worried if this is the route this franchise is gonna take its fine to have some fun stuff in it but not too much its a fun movie thats for sure but not a good one
Mar 30 2024,positive,very enjoyable  flick its more of a kong movie with godzilla in it the human parts drag but the monster action is top notch
Mar 30 2024,positive,monster mayhem fun pacing and length just right some of the jokesfunny lines that were supposed to make you laugh fell a little flat but its not a comedy of course i loved the music and lots of 90s type music that was cool
Mar 30 2024,positive,moive was a 10 out of 10 for me it had lots of action
Mar 30 2024,positive,that wasmonsterific godzilla and kong teaming up was everything and not to spoil it too much but lets just say i never thought i would see another kaiju ally reappear straight from its chrysalis thats all ill give out yall better check out this movie if youre big monster movie fan
Mar 30 2024,positive,this is a fun entertaining movie it may not win any oscars but it is a great way to have a feel good movie experience  i would have liked more godzilla and a bit more backstory on shimo  i would also love to know what mothra said to godzilla to calm him down the movie mixes comedy action and just enough emotion to make it all work
Mar 30 2024,positive,i loved the movie  less humans like i love it seeing it again saturday also showing what the critics gave it instead of what millions gave it on the main page is a cornball thing to do
Mar 30 2024,positive,absolutely loved this movie the monsters are the primary cast and the humans are supporting roles if i would say one thing i wish was in this it is godzillas theme by akira ifukube and reprised by bear mccreary otherwise it is pretty nonstop action with a decent plot
Mar 30 2024,positive,this movie is exactly what you would want in a monsterverse film
Mar 30 2024,positive,great familykid friendly movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,it was a blast of extreme kaiju madness and if we go to these movies we go exactly for that it is a master piece and is extremely underrated despite of the negative reviews i feel that this movie is the 2nd best movie of 2024 following dune part 2  i can describe it as a movie with a slight comedy as they were not really concentrating on that to be honest unlike the over the top action sequences  the human sub plot was not bad unlike godzilla vs kong  and the human characters felt not so useless but still the movies lacks millie bobby brown rather than scar king who is not that bad shimo is a very good villain godzilla didnt shine its brightest as kong is the main character but we need the third movie to be cantered under godzilla any way it is a great blockbuster and is a 100 must watch and among the best of 2024
Mar 30 2024,positive,i like the movie so far great movie  i just wish it was a little bit longer
Mar 30 2024,positive,the visuals are amazing the monster scenes are epic this may be the shortest monsterverse film but it is by no means boring this movie has nonstop action if you come to see the two stars godzilla and kong then get ready for an exciting 2 hours
Mar 30 2024,negative,sorry but this was shockingly dull which is kinda depressing given all the nonstop frankly oppressive and exhausting spectacle at work
Mar 30 2024,positive,i literally dont understand why you should bring up so much about small things that others dont like for me the truth is this was the best monster movie ive seen giving an extremely important role to the kaiju in the movie and that makes the movie entertaining and yes i know its all cgi but were talking about the monstervers where yes the kaijus steal the screen and i wont be ungrateful like others but we thank the director who made this film and the actors who were part of it too
Mar 30 2024,positive,godzilla vs kong the new empire delivers a superb visual treat with impressive vfx work the buildup of characters and certain scenes gives goosebumps however the first half feels flat particularly in exploring the world of hollow earth the main drawback lies in the weak screenplay especially during the rushed climax where the powerful characters are dragged down by the screen play however visuals are stunning
Mar 30 2024,positive,its giant monsters fighting each other in amusing ways that is all but it is very enjoyable
Mar 30 2024,positive,classic godzilla kong cant wait to see whats next
Mar 30 2024,neutral,the movie was very busy i didnt like the story a classic godzilla villain would have been preferred  godzilla minus one was a much stronger film

Mar 30 2024,positive,great fight scenes  plot a little thin nothing new to series and the nonsense science jabber was occasionally distracting enjoyed the many fight locales and new villain  missed alexander skarsgard but ace ventura vet was fun will likely watch again when available on a subscription streaming service

Mar 30 2024,positive,loved it engaging and entertaining battles were fun to watch too
Mar 30 2024,positive,my niece and i were both excited to go see the new kong movie we both agreed it was a little disappointing there are some movies you just have to see on the big screen and we thought this was one of them but it fell a little short my niece felt the final fight scene was too short and she thought the size of kong had gotten smaller i agree on both counts most of the film was pretty predictable  i didnt understand why godzilla was indiscriminately destroying cities i realize it was just a movie but things should still make sense all in all i could have waited for it to go to streaming not one that i look forward to seeing again
Mar 30 2024,positive,i loved every minute
Mar 30 2024,positive,you wont be disappointed trust and believe
Mar 30 2024,positive,the movie was good i got really hyped when kong met scar for first time and fought then later fight and godzilla gaining new powers was  only downside to this movie is that the fights are way way way to short especially the final fight in the city it was too short hopefully next movie the fights are longer thats what were all here for
Mar 30 2024,positive,a great omaj to the showa era   lots of kaiju action a must see hope adam returns for another

Mar 30 2024,positive,the movie is awesome excellent action beautiful awesome to look at funny and does something legendary that has not been introduced yet from my knowledge the negatives are there but this isnt a typical masterpiece this is a monster action dream come true masterpiece easily a 810
Mar 30 2024,positive,i really enjoyed the movie and it was really action packed i loved the monsters and the fact that godzilla literally had no mercy for tiamat and scylla shimo is a great addition because it adds more variety to the monsters i feel like they could have added to scar king because he didnt feel as big of a threat as he was shown in the initial trailers i feel like they tried too much with the human characters like they tried to have more emotion with their characters but it just doesnt feel right
Mar 30 2024,positive,its your average king kong movie little to no funny scenes but really good animation pixel it could be better but its king kong theres so many different king kong movies out there its just meh

Mar 30 2024,positive,i love it action packed all through the movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,fantastic monster movie  ignore the idiocritics if your a fan of great cgi and kajus battling it out this is for you great lore building almost nonstop action starting less then 5 minutes into the movie seeing godzilla amping up was awsome the magentazilla was better then i could have hoped for kongs parts where awsome and the movie had slightly more focus on him and his arc but it was all so well done and didnt at all feel like the 2 hour runtime it commanded minimal human story but it was really well done and the lore building was fantastic
Mar 30 2024,positive,i love it gia played amazingly nd godzilla and king paired up good with the help of mini kong and freeza
Mar 30 2024,positive,i really liked the movie i think if you come in knowing that it is not going to be the greatest movie then i think you will have a good time the only thing that felt off was the structure and pacing of the villains story
Mar 30 2024,positive,greatest movie  in the mosnterverse
Mar 30 2024,negative,not sure what the were thinking but im lost to what i just watched
Mar 30 2024,positive,everything a godzilla fan could want kaiju action ftw 
Mar 30 2024,positive,very entertaining movie i just wish it was all about the monsters and not the humans but thats  just me being greedy
Mar 30 2024,positive,action packed kong is always the best
Mar 30 2024,positive,the 5th installment of the monsterverse has absolutely found its feet you never have to wait long between epic action scenes the plot is improved from previous movies with a solid kong background story that keeps you engaged while you enjoy hollywoods best cgi kaiju smash it out absolutely recommend for monster fans
Mar 30 2024,positive,absolutely great one of the best movies ive ever watched perfect amount of godzilla and kong 1010 would recommend
Mar 30 2024,neutral,if youre looking for constant location shifts and way more battles than necessary mostly kong since godzilla spends a lot of time sleeping you might enjoy this movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,guys its peak just go and watch it
Mar 30 2024,positive,this was an absolute blast pure looney showa era kaiju fun with dare i say perfect pacing    2 or 3 jaw dropping moments that brought me to tears with how happy i was at what i was watching us along with the audience cheering made it all the better     simple story with minimal human characters keeping it focused great expressions on all of the kaiju great personality for the main villain
Mar 30 2024,positive,lots of action just too long overkill on slow motion probably for 3d we didnt go to 3d my 2 teen grandkids boygirl gave it a 3 plus also
Mar 30 2024,positive,great storyline acton from start to finish
Mar 30 2024,positive,dont listen to those stupid critics this movie is clearly made for kajui fans an absolute masterpiece must see

Mar 30 2024,positive,amazingly awesomely terrific fun  amaze balls for monster fans everywhere  only wish maybe it was a bit more creepy but other than that im buying this when it comes out
Mar 30 2024,positive,great moviegodzilla came in to help kong in this movie along with mothras help
Mar 30 2024,positive,total monster mayhem what a fun ride with tons of visual awesomeness kong and godzilla are great and this pairing is just pure fun skar king is a cool villain just enough human interaction and great character development for kong so fun wanna see it again
Mar 30 2024,positive,the movie has awesome cgi great visuals and a lot of monsters which is the main focus of the film if you want to see big monsters fighting each other then you should definitely watch this film as it delivers on that point however the story of the movie is weak and unnecessarily fastpaced the transitions from one scene to another feel rushed and lack coherence additionally the main villains of the movie  the skar king and shimo  only appear towards the end and have very little screen time 1520 minutes the final battle of rio also ends too quickly and abruptly leaving the viewer confused despite these drawbacks the movie does have entertainment value and is definitely not boring its a onetime watch movie that should be seen on the biggest screen possible
Mar 30 2024,positive,movie was great needs a sequel 
Mar 30 2024,positive,i am not even kidding words cannot describe how fun this film was to me it was packed with fun plenty of action and fights and some funny moments as well if you are looking for a fun monster movie with many actionpacked moments and fights this is the perfect film
Mar 30 2024,positive,godzilla x kong is a must see film with amazing action with great monster designs and honestly one of the best monsterverse films ever made this film should not be compared to godzilla minus one theses are two different films but will be loved by any kajiu or godzilla fan 1010
Mar 30 2024,positive,for it being a godzilla x kong movie its extremely lacking godzilla and the villian is almost forgettable but if you like big monter movies that smash then the finale is just for you the story with people sucks but godzilla and kong are true kings of what they do
Mar 30 2024,positive,great 3d effects and positive story line
Mar 30 2024,positive,incredibly fun and absolutely visually phenomenal i would most definitely recommend the film to everybody especially the fans a total blast all the way through
Mar 30 2024,positive,if youre looking for a thoughtprovoking cerebral film go watch minus one again if youre looking for a great time where you can turn your brain off for a bit and watch monsters beat each other senseless and do cool stuff this is the one you want its big dumb fun with humor in the right places
Mar 30 2024,positive,very entertaining is fun just turn your brain off and enjoy the story was understandable and the human element was less annoying recommended watch
Mar 30 2024,positive,the fact that kong knew they needed godzilla to bring balance was epic all the kaiju were awesome 
Mar 30 2024,negative,when i watched first films about king kong i was entertained i cried i felt heartbroken this was an adventure love triangle beautiful scenery and exciting story i wondered what happens next the more recent king kong scull island was a disappointment  fake landscape nonexistent dinosaurs chasing king kong stumbling upon each other one bloody mess very long and annoying now this film is an absolute disaster we all know that king kong survived fall from empire building had heart transplant acquired giant wife and a baby and then died where is godzilla coming from  also cgi and wrong proportions of these two creatures make this film a total waste watch something else
Mar 30 2024,positive,this movie is a lot of fun and keeps you entertained the whole time there are a lot of things you have to take at surface level because it sort of seems to come out of nowhere at least 3 times during this movie i found myself saying oh how convenient for them overall a lot of fun they may have crammed to much into one movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,loved the movie hands down 5stars
Mar 30 2024,positive,this is the best movie ever they were literally doing wwe moves

Mar 30 2024,positive,this movie i just watched for the first time today with my little brother let me tell you we were glued to the screen all action like when i was in my room with my godzilla and kong figures making them fight was on the big screen this movie will hold a special part in my heart
Mar 30 2024,positive,both monsters where very fun and exciting to see on screen and the newest villain was also a pretty intimidating threat i felt it was a tad bit rushed but i still had a great time
Mar 30 2024,positive,this movie was a total thrill ride everything about it was so satisfying for me it was the best monster film yet
Mar 30 2024,positive,awesome movie my kids and i loved it need to see in imax fight scenes were badass was definitely geared more towards kong wish godzilla had a little more screen time shimu was cool and godzilla was a force of nature all hail the king of the monsters

Mar 30 2024,positive,i started rewatching all the monster verse movies and the monarch tv series and i am addicted was super excited to see this always found the human stories to be eh except the first godzilla 2014    glad to see this one took a small step back with the human elements and let the monsters fight it out totally recommend to watch in imax the action sequences were silly fun spectacular and downright epic     hope to see more in the monster verse down the line 
Mar 30 2024,positive,good monster action 
Mar 30 2024,positive,kong movie showing the power house he is
Mar 30 2024,positive,loved that they added more kaiju fighting and godzilla wrecked havoc the ending was a bit abrupt and unfinished but still awsome movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,the animals seem to robotic godzilla never moved so fast especially showing him running  a little too far fetched
Mar 30 2024,positive,its the best movie in the world i love it
Mar 30 2024,positive,a fantastic thriller with so much nostalgic feeling from the showa era i would definitely recommend watching this

Mar 30 2024,positive,action packed and a fun family watch
Mar 30 2024,positive,this movie was a blast to see in my local cinema    the titan battles are fast paced and intense their personalities shines along with some good cgi and you got yourself an amazing movie to watch with your friends and families although this movie has some issues mainly with the human stuff being meh as usual except bernie and trapper as those two are my goats in this movie and the cgi on certain scenes are questionable and odd but it didnt have that any effect on me and i can definitely look past that and enjoy the movie from start to finish with no problem at all    i give this movie a 910 highly recommend you seeing this in the theatres and at home when it gets a bluray release
Mar 30 2024,positive,didnt watch previous  ones so didnt get it

Mar 30 2024,positive,a good sequel to godzilla vs kong however its even more kong focused the final part of the movie could have been longer and key moments with godzilla could have been longer as well the human element is passable
Mar 30 2024,positive,its amazing the movie shows amazing visuals and really enjoyed the action without any human cutoff i really enjoyed it there are alot of actions in this movie and no 10 minutes without an action or fight i love the 3 alpha titans fought a one merciless ruthless ruler and one slaved ancient titan i like the genre
Mar 30 2024,positive,being a long time godzilla fan what cant u dislike about this movie it has a plot that gives each character meaning love it
Mar 30 2024,positive,i found this movie very fun an entertaining this probably has the best monster mayhem sequences and the action sequences did deliver yes it had some downsides but overall this was a great monster movie and a good one to bring your kids to watch and if i were to watch it again i would love to see it in theaters again amazing movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,this movie did not disappoint it was amazing

Mar 30 2024,positive,the fight scenes were very well done the additional pseudo titans that were brought in were cool the orangutan the extra gorillas the special effects were top notch where it was a little lacking it took a little long to get to the final fight scene that included the addition of mothra and then the final fight scene ended super quick
Mar 30 2024,positive,easily my favorite monster verse movie of all time godzilla x kong the new empire is an amazing action packed kaiju flim
Mar 30 2024,positive,i absolutely loved this movie  so much carnage and screen time of the monsters  i wasnt a fan of mimusone because we didnt get enough godzilla  but this movie balances it out perfectly  a mustsee in my opinion and my new favorite godzilla movie of all time godzilla monsterverse moviereview
Mar 30 2024,positive,very silly and fun movie of course it isnt as deep and emotional as godzilla minus one but its still a very fun time and will be sure to have you smiling and rooting for godzilla and kong
Mar 30 2024,positive,exactly what you want out of these movies limited human subplot with some jokes awesome monster fights love how kong could carry a scene through pure emotion on his face i
Mar 30 2024,positive,great monster action perfect amount of character development and best use of cgi you want fight scenes this is the movie to watch as a huge godzilla fan kong was a flipping boss every titan was done justice what are you doing reading this comment go watch it
Mar 30 2024,positive,i think the movie was honestly really good  do not see why so many people are not happy with it it was full of action and suspense better than godzilla vs kong 1 thus far great movie 1010 would recommend
Mar 30 2024,positive,lots of faced paced action cool fight scenes awesome last battle sequence nice jia story
Mar 30 2024,positive,great movie and throwback to the showa era of godzilla kong was an absolute star in this movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,i dont get the procritics this is a monster movie do not expect some cheessy story just 2 hours of old monster smashing as the title suggest godzilla carries the entire movie and the evolved design veins deserves an oscar for best visuals
Mar 30 2024,positive,it was was predictable but the 3d effects were superb

Mar 30 2024,positive,i love the godzilla series as well as king kong i love legendarys version and godzilla vs king kong the previous title in series was excellent i was hoping it would do better and it was exceptionally better i do feel they lacked in the department of explanation saying how important the danger was they forced to inference with no real direction and only if you had prior knowledge to the series and characters would you fully understand
Mar 30 2024,positive,massive kaiju action its a must watch for any kaiju fan
Mar 30 2024,positive,this movie knows what it is a fun romp of monster fights its enjoyable from beginning to end highly recommend imax 3d

Mar 30 2024,positive,a film that we all expected it to be monster clash cool visuals interesting plot kind of all over the place with the direction especially with godzilla just i like godzilla vs kong a lot better
Mar 30 2024,positive,an awesome new entry to the monsterverse i had somewhat worrying expectations beforehand but the action more than made up for it there were even more monsters than expected plus the story didnt negatively effect the film a small cast worked well with all of the monster madness bernie and tracker were funny and gave the audience something to laugh about besides the ridiculousness of godzilla and kongs brawls i would have liked to see more of godzilla and shimo though the cgi was spectacular for the most part and the film is exactly what the fans have been asking for this is a must see movie ideally in imax
Mar 30 2024,positive,really fun lots of action  world building
Mar 30 2024,positive,non stop action and a heartfelt story great movie for young and old to see

Mar 30 2024,positive,good movie for fans of both characters
Mar 30 2024,positive,it was awesome me and my family really enjoyed it
Mar 30 2024,positive,when you go to the theatre and expect to watch a movie about big monsters and you actually see it well lucky for me because everything that i expected actually appeared here in this movie absolutely love how the kaijus has a lot of screen time of this movie and the showcasing of the world building of this franchise gxk you rock
Mar 30 2024,positive,if you go into this movie expecting a good fun time it absolutely delivers monsters are beautifully portrayed action scenes are phenomenal and even the human aspects of the movie are much more fulfilling than previous monster movies the final battle could have gone on a little bit longer but all in all a fantastic watch
Mar 30 2024,positive,movie is really good for what it is and what it is is a movie about the lives of these giant monsters in our world and theirs hollow earth i think people are focusing on the human aspect too much and looking for too much from the human in my humble opinion i think the cast did a great job its funny and moving i really enjoyed the mother daughter dynamicsubplot and is serviceable also in contrast the budding father son relationship between kong and suko the small ape is really well done in conclusion i think there are a lot of really good elements in the movie that are being  overlooked simply because the monsters are not being looked at as full characters with emotions and development
Mar 30 2024,positive,this movie is so incredibly stupid i loved every second of it
Mar 30 2024,positive,great action kaiju fights was satisfactory the plot allowed for more world building in this universe they fleshed out pun intended a lot of things in this movie action and story were well balanced
Mar 30 2024,positive,i found the movie entertaining my young sons loved it the young actor was very good
Mar 30 2024,positive,love the fast pace of the story more monster action a new world with new untold dangers

Mar 29 2024,positive,movie was amazing exactly what us monsterverse fans wanted action packed with a ton of titan screen time loved every second of the movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,one of the most hype movies ive seen so far its fun to watch although a little short from start to finish the movie kept me hyped especially the godzilla scenes kong had more screen time and was the more fleshed out character but every time godzilla showed up it was a blast and for those who are comparing it to minus one just dont they are 2 different types of films just be happy that there are 2 different godzilla universes going on simultaneously and that there is something for everyone
Mar 29 2024,positive,just a fantastic movie must watch if you ware a fan  of godzilla kong and kaiju in general my son and i loved it great action just the right amount of dialogue and plenty of screen time for godzilla and kong 1010

Mar 29 2024,positive,love godzilla started kind of hokey but it pulled itself together for a cool storyline go go godzilla kong  mothra
Mar 29 2024,positive,silly but enjoyable
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie is awesome if you want to have 2 hours of fun you need to see this movie the monsters were the main stars in this film and i really appreciate that the fights are spectacular the visuals are amazing and overall it is a great movie in terms of things that i didnt like i wish the action wasnt pushed to the final act of the movie the last 45ish minutes has a lot of cool moments with the monsters but to me it makes some of the titans feel under utilized specifically skar king and shimo other than that id say adam winguard did a great job with this film and i hope to see him again for the next one
Mar 29 2024,positive,gxk was an absolute blast watching it again tonight
Mar 29 2024,positive,had a great time watching this movie big monster fighting with some humor and good music sprinkled in what more could you want 
Mar 29 2024,positive,lots more monsters time on screen and a human story to compliment the monsters rather than try and take the spotlight great watch
Mar 29 2024,positive,godzilla x kong was great action from start to finish godzilla was all about the business he had everyone that opposed him on sight kong and sukos bonding was fun and the final fight was very long and non stop kaiju action i love this film and cant wait to see more of the monsterverse highly recommend watching
Mar 29 2024,positive,such a fun popcorn movie  nothing better than watching giant kaiju fight exactly what i wanted in a godzilla and kong movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,loved it some movies that have so much action going on tend to have cheesy stories the story was well balanced and the action was excellent everyone who likes these types of movies will love this movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,must see action and it is very entertaining and fun
Mar 29 2024,positive,good monster action fights like always but what bothered me is that they extended the duration for the human scenes compared to the previous movie it takes like 60 of the movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,i actually liked the experience of the 4dx the movie was ok
Mar 29 2024,positive,it made my mom cry at the end i dont know why
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie reminded me of good times of 1973 at the drivein with my dad took my 3 kids and it did not disappoint in the least if your there for a huge plot your there for the wrong reason this is unapologetically a have fun and take it in movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,thrilling from start to finish  and didnt hurt watching it in 4d
Mar 29 2024,positive,there have been so many bad movies this was a good entertaining movie lots of fun
Mar 29 2024,positive,this was just sheerly amazing while yes the story between the humans is definitely flawed im almost certain everyone went to the cinemas just to see good looking cgi battles between a lot and i mean a lot of monsters the cgi was mostly good the battles were fantastic to watch and i loved the part of the movie when kong and suko were bonding together you could surprisingly feel what they were saying to each other just from their facial expressions and actions alone great movie totally recommend to to a local cinema and just have a ton of fun with it like everyone has
Mar 29 2024,neutral,too freaking funny and such a wild movie not bad but not good either just soooooo much destruction and no one careswhatlol
Mar 29 2024,positive,i loved  this movie for me it was the best movie in the series so far  it had tons of action a good story and even some comedy plus none of the actors were intolerable and i loved the little ape lol he was one of the best parts of the movie for me i definitely give it two thumbs up if you like godzilla and kong you will like this movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,i really enjoyed this movie it was fun and had all the different aspects that a good classic monster movie needs the evil monsters are a great match for godzilla and kong the locations are beautiful and original yet fit well with into the film series the actors do a great job with their roles maintaining the fun and appealing aspects of their characters the story though formulaic is still enjoyable with some nice gems added in to give the movie warmth and fun the dentist bit was a great sub story line that i especially liked and was used very well   i went to the theatre expecting a fun japanese style kaiju movie and that is what i got
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie has got to be the best out of all the monster verse films it was honestly way better than godzilla vs kong with this one have tons more action and more character development making this an awesome thrilling and creative piece of cinema keep up the good work
Mar 29 2024,positive,the battles in this movie were awaome although the beginning was a little slow the final fight made up for it
Mar 29 2024,positive,cyberpunk aesthetic with an 80s style synthwave music score more monsters than people  epic kaiju battles  a modern day showa era monster movie  loved it
Mar 29 2024,negative,this was one of the worst movies ive ever paid to see in a theater i love dumb fun but when an animal executes a better suplex than goldberg on another animal you just have to shake your head and laugh at it the humans characters are dreadful the dan stevens character is a direct starlord rip off if they made this movie without human characters it would have been a massive improvement
Mar 29 2024,positive,so good no dislike all loved beauty and pictures and the colors
Mar 29 2024,positive,i absolutely loved the amount of titan action there was my one and only gripe was the build up to the final fight scene was awesome it was the fight itself was short in my opinion none the less my favorite monsterverse movie by far legendary thanks for finally solidifying godzilla and kongs friendship legendary big ups on this one
Mar 29 2024,positive,overall a fun movie i did have a few problems with it but they dont hinder the movie too much i really enjoyed it
Mar 29 2024,positive,great movie loved it
Mar 29 2024,positive,the action and kong side of the story are the soul of this movie the human characters arent bad either personally like them more than gvk it picks up pace on the finale and it never really stops which it kinda weighs it down but it was a great time i would say i hope that the monsterverse takes a small break and find a direction after all these movies because i feel that there needs a stronger direction on it for the future if we keep doing it the same multiple times it can get old and mv is the perfect universe for variety besides that i had a great time
Mar 29 2024,positive,such a fun movie dont overthink it just sit back relax and enjoy the ride
Mar 29 2024,positive,epic and constant monster battles very little down time between monsters being on screen when humans are on screen its actually pretty entertaining with motherdaughter relationship retrurning characters ilene andrews and adopted daughter jia and some great humor yet again from bernie made me feel like a kid again watching godzilla movies on tv so much fun and i love to go again
Mar 29 2024,positive,had an absolute blast highly recommend you watch it in imax 3d as it was incredible in that format 1010
Mar 29 2024,positive,monster movies are for monster fing things up and beating each other up this is what that was not a perfect story but doesnt need to be went for monsters and godzilla thats exactly what we got loved it now just need destroyah
Mar 29 2024,positive,you know how it took almost an hour to get godzilla in the first one not this movie its action from the jump i loved it and if you enjoy this type of movie you will too well done
Mar 29 2024,positive,i think theres more runtime dedicated to the awesome monsters than the lame humans this time around and it absolutely works it wont move you or make you cry like minus one but it delivers action galore and makes you want to cheer damn good monster movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,my spouse is a big godzilla fan so i surprised him with tickets we both enjoyed the movie especially all the action it had me on the edge of my seat
Mar 29 2024,negative,this is the tiktok of movies for a brainless hot mess action
Mar 29 2024,negative,some of it was good but i felt like they couldve did better godzilla minus one is still better imo
Mar 29 2024,positive,awesome really fun ride kids loved it
Mar 29 2024,positive,i honestly enjoyed this movie i loved seeing godzilla and kong unite as a team lots of action and monster battles i loved how it was more focused on the titans than the humans i was so happy that mothra returned scar king and shimos backstory were very creative i give this movie a 1010 best kaiju movie of all time and the ultimate teamup of the century spoiler warning
Mar 29 2024,positive,pack with action good movie to enjoy with the family
Mar 29 2024,positive,amazing full of actions
Mar 29 2024,positive,a great action movie a throwback to when summer movies were supposed to be lots of action and a lot fun
Mar 29 2024,positive,i liked it the human storyline of course is lame as always but the kaiju scenes are amazing
Mar 29 2024,positive,old school action mixed with cgi  entertaining enough 
Mar 29 2024,positive,godzilla x kong is by far the best instalment to the monsterverse loaded with kaiju action and a way to pay homage to the showaera films of godzilla had a blast movie was 810 dougs at best but 5 starts for being kaiju action
Mar 29 2024,positive,great movie its rare that a fifth installment is actually better than some of the previous movies in the series but this one is certainly better they didnt waste much time with forced human plot lines and instead focused on the monsters i appreciated that ever since the first godzilla and the first kong every other human plot line has felt forced they finally just gave us a great smashing monster movie cant wait to see whats next
Mar 29 2024,positive,big monster fight what a good film perfect cgi is everything a big fan of kong and godzilla wants to see a fight between highlevel monsters kong being respected as the titan king of the hollow earth and all that watch this movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,very good would have liked the bad monster to be more menacing but still very good  
Mar 29 2024,positive,loved every minute of it
Mar 29 2024,negative,had a hard time watching to the end
Mar 29 2024,positive,took my kids and they absolutely loved it  great to watch with 3d glasses
Mar 29 2024,positive,dont expect much from the dialogues but the battles are epic worth watching in the big screen
Mar 29 2024,positive,the movie was alright i have nothing against it i love godzilla and kong the only thing i didnt like was the fights felt like they were rushed they were not what i expected from watching previous godzilla movies also the visual effects did not make it look real the fights looked like as if they were a rip off of wwe not that it wasnt cool to see it but that it just made it look to fake another was the cgi looked a bit off for example the cgi from godzilla king of the monsters was amazing nothing was off everything looked realistic and perfect i hope they do not make the same mistake for upcoming monsterverse films
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie showed the monsters on screen more times than any other movie in the monsterverse the story was great but when read about it explains skull island the movie explained less than what i expected the monster fights were epic and the monster designs were fantastic
Mar 29 2024,positive,godzilla and kong never disappoint always great to see them  even showing up with special mothra appearance my family and i enjoyed it
Mar 29 2024,positive,id say its pretty good    im glad the story finally expanded on the past between the great apes and godzilla with skar king being the provoker of the war kong had good character development the action was good as well    although it aint perfect the cgi went down a fair bit mothras addition while cool felt unnecessary and the whole spectacle of skar king being the biggest threat yet yeah no bro got ragdolled by goji and kong and then shimo    if youre in for a monster mash youre in for a treat if youre in for a depthful story driven movie about the monsters save your money and time    lets hope adam shitard doesnt flap his gums to discredit kong entirely a second time
Mar 29 2024,positive,movie was very good however toward the end during the final battle screen went dark however could still hear the movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,godzilla x kong is both a journey to the center of the earth style adventure film and the ultimate tagteam monster brawl rolled into one in other words its my kind of movie loved the emphasis on the kaiju pointofview this time around as well as the synthwaverock soundtrack i even dug the human characters especially trapper that guy was a hoot
Mar 29 2024,positive,the movie was incredible they did such an amazing job portraying emotion and dialogue through nonverbal communication and the fight scenes were so well done i loved every second of this film
Mar 29 2024,positive,best movie so far of the year
Mar 29 2024,positive,once again the critics are on something this movie was excellent as a true godzilla fan i was not disappointed it was exactly what i wanted a godzilla film with showa level crazy brought into modern cinema this is a must see 99 out of 10 bravo adam wingard bravo 
Mar 29 2024,positive,love this exactly what we all wanted great action even more monsters   i will say brian tyree henrys character was way funnier this time
Mar 29 2024,positive,very good movie definitely worth watching
Mar 29 2024,positive,i was very unsure how they were going to pull off this dynamic duo but they did it and it made sense to me when they did and there is at least one surprise i wont mention
Mar 29 2024,negative,still not a perfect monstermovie but there are definitely things it improves on as a hollywood monstermovie  a pass 
Mar 29 2024,positive,worth seeing but movie had bad directing and no storyline weird background music the whole movie should have had peter jackson produce it instead
Mar 29 2024,positive,action packed with a solid story line
Mar 29 2024,positive,the action and humor of the titans and some of the cast members
Mar 29 2024,negative,not a very coherent story line too many disjointed scenes over acting except for the mute people   the titans were beautifully done  i am hoping this was satire because it was really funny in a corny satirical way
Mar 29 2024,positive,i think this is a 1010 movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,the movie was filled with action and excitement  it was very entertaining
Mar 29 2024,positive,great to see godzila and kong back on the big screen and the movie does have some fun spots however it suffers from bad pacing lack of character development and a tone that is more like a buddy cop movie than an end of the world apocalypse
Mar 29 2024,positive,epic with dbox seats
Mar 29 2024,positive,great and amazing movie with epic adventure and story and visuals  love the 80s music and vibe
Mar 29 2024,positive,i liked it and dont normally watch king kong
Mar 29 2024,positive,it was a good movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,critics are gonna hate it  but i love it
Mar 29 2024,positive,excellent storyline kong only had godzilla and man as his rivals he deserved a villain of his own and the development of allies was well done the integration of the iwi and their ancestral role with various titans was told in a way that captures attention     oh and some great 80s songs on the sountrack
Mar 29 2024,positive,100000010 my movie of year
Mar 29 2024,positive,it was alive action packed and interesting
Mar 29 2024,positive,dude this movie was awesome dont listen to the critics theyre way off i saw it in imax and it was an incredible experience

Mar 29 2024,positive,love it wish they make more like this
Mar 29 2024,positive,amazing movie very fun to watch will be watching it again
Mar 29 2024,positive,this is my first rotten tomatoes review and im not gonna sit here and claim to be a professional critic but i will say that if youre a fan of godzilla king kong and this world in general youre going to love this movie godzilla x kong the new empire delivered on every level of monsters and awesomeness the monsters are the reason we buy tickets and they make every penny worth it theres a lot of people who are comparing this film to the recent oscar winning success of godzilla minus one and i hate to sound like an ahole but those people really need to shut up they are two completely different movies anyone with half a brain should at the very least understand that while the human side of things steps a little more into the ridiculous side of things considering the first movie in this series godzilla 2014 they dont shy away from the monsters and the big bombastic action sequences this is a perfect movie to take your family to your date or even just your buddies grab a large drink a hot dog and a super cool gxk cup and buckle up cant wait for the next movie in the ever growing monsterverse
Mar 29 2024,positive,a very simple but entertaining story not the worst in the franchise as g2 but not the best still it keeps you all your attention upgraded godzilla is a bad ass
Mar 29 2024,positive,if youre looking for an allout global kaiju brawl then youve found it the filmmakers have also seemed to finally find the perfect balance of human character to monster fighting screen time ratio well done everyone
Mar 29 2024,positive,great popcorn movie lots of fun
Mar 29 2024,positive,i loved the storytelling of the titans history
Mar 29 2024,neutral,pretty much what was expected with lots of kaiju action and big destructive fight scenes  the three plotlines each have their merits and tie together nicely but it did slow the pace in the middle and the big showdown at the end felt a bit anticlimactic  most of it was a bit silly but it was entertaining and fun with good special effects plenty of action and ample lighthearted moments  the human characters were annoying but bearable but the spectacle of the setting and human side of kong made up for it  its a great world theyve created with monarch and hollow earth but there is only so much you can get out of the overall premise
Mar 29 2024,positive,great popcorn flick shut off your brain and enjoy monsters fighting
Mar 29 2024,positive,perfection this movie everything you want to see i highly recommend you watch this it was so good and the action was insane definitely my 1 movie of the year
Mar 29 2024,positive,i believe this is the best mv movie ever especially the part where godzilla with kong with suko  mothra united  team up against skar king  shimo  and finally freed shimo  defeated skar king  in the finale in rio both godzilla  kong are now officially brothers in arms friendsallies  i hope well see them godzilla kong team up again along with mothra rodan shimo anguirus get introduced suko minizillaget introduced against a new villain in the next 3rd upcoming future gxk sequel movie if adam wingard will do it right
Mar 29 2024,positive,great action much better than expected
Mar 29 2024,positive,really good  wished the final battle was longer  hoping for a 3rd one
Mar 29 2024,positive,totally epic long live the kings
Mar 29 2024,positive,omg best king kong godzilla movie yet loved that they brought mothera back
Mar 29 2024,positive,the best one yet and there was nothing to dislike what i do recommend is to watch it in 3d 1010
Mar 29 2024,positive,loved it so much the action was great and i love godzillas new look must see movie 
Mar 29 2024,positive,we were entertained
Mar 29 2024,positive,action was great started off slow but it turned out great i thought i wouldnt like it but i did
Mar 29 2024,positive,was a good move im team godzilla and if you are to dont go in there thinking youre gonna see alot of himm this is a kong movie first and foremost having said that the action was good kept the pace up and some of the fight scenes were awesome
Mar 29 2024,positive,action packed all through
Mar 29 2024,positive,its fun on the eye but thats all i think the story line got lost in middle earth minus one  skull island are levels above
Mar 29 2024,positive,everyone godzilla x kong ruled   they smoothed out most of the human interactions so that they are not prodigiously excruciating like in 2014 godzilla vs kong and king of monsters in fact it is better than all three to me     it knows exactly what it is    and delivers some of the best titan battles i could have hoped for it leans straight into being a scifi franchise now  it was like a buddy cop meets guardians of the galaxy meets vaporwave meets dragon ball z
Mar 29 2024,positive,it was awesome action packed from  beginning to the end
Mar 29 2024,positive,action packed the monsters were the main characters  and the story was good
Mar 29 2024,positive,it was amazing that words cant express how amazing yhis movie is

Mar 29 2024,positive,son went with his friend both enjoyed the movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,i really enjoyed the movie is there going to be another one

Mar 29 2024,positive,i liked when  mothra made kong and godzilla to team together to fight a common enemy
Mar 29 2024,positive,so awesome great effects loved every minute of it exhausted from being so tense see this movie who care about a good story its not oppenheimer for goodness sake and thank god its not
Mar 29 2024,positive,wether youre a diehard fan of the monster verse or you just love seeing kaiju battle it out i think youll have a really good time with this latest entry this movie has some of the best monster action we have seen in the monster verse while the human characters may not be very interesting thats not why people like me go to watch these movies we just want to see some godzilla and kong action
Mar 29 2024,positive,excellent movie the best of the monsterverse good action sequences and uff godzilla a fucking god
Mar 29 2024,positive,movie was great lots of action and fights
Mar 29 2024,positive,this is the best movie ever for me personally there are no bad things to say about it adam you and the actors did and amazing job with this i cant wait to see more like this in the future
Mar 29 2024,positive,to keep this short if you just want to shut your brain off and have a good time then id recommend you watch this for a movie night but dont expect much because its nothing special but still fun enough to watch
Mar 29 2024,positive,if youre looking for monsters beating the hell out of each other look no further amazing cinematography and film always love a great godzilla and kong duo
Mar 29 2024,positive,pretty generic but still good
Mar 29 2024,positive,really big and really dumb fun overall enjoyed it but definitely a step down from godzilla vs kong
Mar 29 2024,positive,1010 maybe the final battle was fast a little but it gave that titan fights throughout the whole movie cant wait for the next
Mar 29 2024,positive,the fights as usual were great i liked the visual effects and bringing in mothra i also enjoyed how kong beat up the scar king but he gave up and brought his cheat code out the human scenes were boring and the writing was ok this movie is exactly what you think it will be i will say to bring back mothra was brought out really quickly and it was built up over that last movie but it happened so easily overall decent monster mash fight movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,movie was good hit on all areas scenes were dope
Mar 29 2024,positive,im a big godzilla fan i thought this movie was awesome im gonna see it again but this time in 3d
Mar 29 2024,positive,absolutely amazing movie cant wait to watch again one of the best movies of 2024 the music was so guardians of the galaxy vibes very fun and didnt get bored a second while watching amazing job and love how they displayed indigenous cultures in the movie very respectful and inspiring
Mar 29 2024,positive,a truly great movie especially for godzilla and kong fans personally i recommend going to the cinema to see this movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie was so good everyone in the room was cheering and clapping yet again a another banger
Mar 29 2024,negative,too bad movie terrible
Mar 29 2024,positive,this is a awesome  hell of a good time loved  it
Mar 29 2024,positive,lots of monsters and a good story  action packed with humor full circle for king kong
Mar 29 2024,positive,love that the movie was more about the titans than the human characters creative back story of skar and shimo cant wait whats next for godzilla
Mar 29 2024,positive,epic new story all the favorite characters this movie was amazing and we loved every minute
Mar 29 2024,positive,happy to see longtime godzillakong fans enjoy the movie wasnt my favorite but it was great i get what the critics are saying about the story but also the fans it is supposed to be action packed fun and goofy i fully support and respect adam wingard for taking this route if this makes fans happy resulting in more future content then im all for it
Mar 29 2024,positive,excellent  we really enjoyed movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,big loud fun and dumb im more of a godzilla fan but king kong is the star here the human element wasnt bad  mostly comedic relief with one surprisingly emotional subplot for a two hour time killer it did the job
Mar 29 2024,positive,i enjoyed this movie if you want to see a giant action blockbuster then this is the film for you personally 1010 best godzillakong film to date
Mar 29 2024,negative,legendary still hasnt figured out how to kaiju it was better than expected and better than previous monsterverse it kinda felt like pro wrestling fights over the top theatrics but with a wink and a grin we all know its really fake its partially due to the unrealistic fast and acrobatic movement of the kaiju it seemed like they were trying to keep upping the stakes with over the top action until it got a little silly     yes late showa was exactly the same thats why we had a decade long drought after terror of mechagodzilla i just feel like theyre not always paying proper homage to the character the fact that toho did it too doesnt make it any less frustrating i can get into the movie much better when i can view it through a human characters eyes and legendary mostly has one dimensional people and a gojira with a touch too much personality if that makes any sense i like a sterile unfeeling brutish force of nature godzilla one that cant be reasoned with he is our karma for our actions against the planet     that being said all kaiju films have value and the monsterverse bros are gonna love this comic book style action fest    congrats on 70 years you academy award winnng brutish force of nature  
Mar 29 2024,negative,same storynot much of a story
Mar 29 2024,positive,i enjoyed this movie so much the cinema fans around me were yelling and clapping throughout the movie action was astonishing with the lead role kong we need more
Mar 29 2024,positive,real godzilla fan will know how crazy and fun the original movies were legendarys version keeps that essences and adds more realistic tones i loved the movie and want to buy a dvd copy when it comes out godzilla x kong
Mar 29 2024,positive,just go to it knowing you wont come out of the movie a scholar or knowledgeable about prehistoric monsters  mindless fun with lots of monster fight scenes eye popping cgi scenery and nary a story plot
Mar 29 2024,positive,this is full of what you want in kaiju type movies loads of action battles and drama even at around 2hrs some of it seems a little rushed if youre a godzilla andor kong andor monster movie enthusiast this will more than satisfy your needs
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie was absolutely fun jam packed with lots of references and kong and godzilla dynamic worked out pretty well and the villains were real menaces especially skar king just throwing one of the kongs into the lava was just wow
Mar 29 2024,positive,definitely my favorite of the series   if youre a g fan youll enjoy it
Mar 29 2024,positive,it was the kind of epic kaiju story that 60s era godzilla tried to pull off but was too limited by special effects tech to do  truthfully half the fun for me was imagining what it might look like if it was filmed then
Mar 29 2024,positive,does what it says on the tin all action kaiju extravaganza a great fun movie that audiences will enjoy delivers the action and special effects as expected enough back story to satisfy but not too much to detract from the action dont listen to the critics reviews the audience score is what matters
Mar 29 2024,positive,do not listen to the critic reviews this movie is a silly fun and action packed movie thats not made for critics the cast is awesome the monster action is non stop and takes up half of the movie this is not a movie taken seriously its made for fun this is a must see movie for people of all ages godzilla and monsterverse fans like me will love it    yes i have seen it
Mar 29 2024,positive,what a movie loved the new characters like trapper and suko
Mar 29 2024,positive,im going to stay up front i wasnt a fan of godzilla versus kong but i was pleasantly surprised by this one i left the movie theater with a smile if you did like godzilla versus king kong then you will really like this one
Mar 29 2024,positive,awesome lots of action
Mar 29 2024,positive,movie was amazing and the ticket price  the movie was a very good action movie for the most part the fight scene were very good the storyline was amazing but could add some adjustments overall the movie was great the duo of godzilla and kong was good the villain was good i wish i could see more of scar king but overall very good solid movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,its what i expected
Mar 29 2024,positive,ive loved godzilla and king kong since the 70s all i want is the monsters fighting and they do a good job in this movie its louder and bigger than any marvel or dc movie spectacular in all ways oh the storyline have you read revelations
Mar 29 2024,negative,the movie was visually pleasing found myself happy with the overall looks of hallow earth and the different settings what really brings this movie down is its poor writing awful characters and bad monster usage this movie was also rushed in the final act the movie could have been a 2 and a half hour movie but it fails to even make 2 hours also as much as i love mothra bringing her back was pretty stupid especially with the way she was brought back one of my biggest complaints was this movie is called godzilla x kong and godzilla doesnt even seem to have half the screen time kong has if you came to see godzilla you will find yourself incredibly disappointed
Mar 29 2024,positive,depends on your vision of a monsterverse movie but this is the best since kotm by far possibly the best offering in the franchise great visuals the humanmonster plot finally compliments each other pacing is good just a great movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,kong wont get a best actor nod come oscar season but the movie is tons of good titan fun
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie was a fun spectacular and amazing ride start to finish this is what us godzilla fans want to see giant monsters beefing it out if youre here for the story only sorry but youre in the wrong place overall a must see if you want to watch an adrenaline fulled cgi monster slug fest would watch in theaters again
Mar 29 2024,positive,the expansion of the monster verse getting better with every movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,the best kong movie hands down
Mar 29 2024,positive,a really fun time especially if you grew up on godzilla movies like godzilla vs megalon or godzilla vs gigan the movies about as far from the tone of godzilla minus one as you can get so its even more surprising how close gxk released to it  the movie is more about kong than godzilla so some fans might be a little disappointed to see the king of the monsters relegated to more of a guest star still when godzilla gets to strut his stuff its great to see
Mar 29 2024,positive,great visuals about time one these monster movies is mostly about monsters unlike the last few   not the human storyline that is usually the case lately
Mar 29 2024,positive,i really cannot wait to watch this movie again it has everything godzilla and kong fans want any kaiju fan will enjoy this movie dont wait and miss out watching it on the big screen
Mar 29 2024,positive,great special affects
Mar 29 2024,positive,bro this movie is insane kong is amazing and godzilla is awesome scar king is such a heel and the final battle with the surprise of mothra was one of the coolest things ive seen the human subplot wasnt actually bad but overall one of the best movies of the year
Mar 29 2024,positive,loved it everything i expected and more see it in a dolby theater
Mar 29 2024,positive,my son likes it a lot better than godzilla minus one i liked the part where they had to fight multiple monsters also the part where kong got an upgrade
Mar 29 2024,positive,the movie was amazing can the critics stop saying it is bad and comparing it to godzilla minus one bothe movies are good i hope they make a sequal for both movies
Mar 29 2024,positive,spoilers      in my personal humble opinion this movie was pretty damn good the build up from the beginning to the middle and near the end was awesome human scenes were better and more interesting than the scenes in gvk the kaiju scenes in this movie was better than any other in the monsterverse franchise however like i said the build up was nice and hyping me up for the final fight but that fight just was the worst part of the movie the trailers and sneak peeks showed about 80 percent of that fight movie could have better with less sneak peeks and more intimidating  villain kaijus skar king was not him though i would still recommend the movie a watch at the big screen   by the way there is post credit scene depending on how it performs at the box office unfortunately  this could end up being the final film of the franchise
Mar 29 2024,positive,i really enjoyed every millisecond of this film honestly i would say that this film is probably the best movie in the franchise beautiful colors fantastic cgi and the humans werent actually pointless for once also big monke uses little monke as weapon 10000000000010 recommended
Mar 29 2024,positive,it was amazing addition to the franchise 
Mar 29 2024,positive,honestly was such a good time  the monster fights are just the best humans arent always gona be great but i didnt really mind was there to see godzilla and kong its there movie and id give it a 810 fun all around monster movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,i really enjoyed the movie it was funny and action packed
Mar 29 2024,positive,just got back from seeing the movie in rpx andomg what a thrill it was    my jaw fell so many times during my viewing its a miracle it didnt pop off my face and hit the floor or fall into my popcorn i felt like i went back in time to when i was ten back where my love for the gman first started    kong was also real awesome in the movie too the way he fought skarr king was a bigger fight than anything the mcu gave us nuts to all the haters and selfnamed professional critics out there if youre a true gfan this movie was made for ya
Mar 29 2024,positive,great movie so good people cheered at the end  loved it and will see it again
Mar 29 2024,positive,amazing movie great fight scenes a lot of monster action new kaijustitans shown fun well written and filled with humor every kaijumonster enjoyer should see this movie a strong 9310  also dont mind the critics who fail to make valid points in their negative reviews and try to compare a goofy childish movie to something as serious as minus one
Mar 29 2024,negative,you will find alot of action but where is the story
Mar 29 2024,positive,i love this movie for about giant monsters
Mar 29 2024,positive,it was great  alot of action too
Mar 29 2024,positive,the film was great for monster fans and godzilla or kong fans so much monster action and even the human story wasnt lackluster the pacing may seem lightning fast but the delivery packed a kaijusized punch
Mar 29 2024,positive,i still cant believe how much i enjoyed this movie i always loved godzilla and i always loved king kong but this folks this is next level stuff im just happy
Mar 29 2024,positive,this is one of the most visually pleasing movies out there and one of the best action you could possibly get and the last fight is very exciting and fun somehow someway the human characters are actually interesting and not boring me to death skar king may not look intimidating in the trailers but once you get to him vs kong in there first fight you will see the true power of him shimo is very very cool godzilla is sadly not in this much but is still awesome as usual when he is on screen this movie can be very hilarious at some points and is the type of movie you wanna go to if you wanna just enjoy yourself for 1 hr 50ish minutes
Mar 29 2024,positive,if you go into this after minus one due to that film winning the oscar award and everything dont expect gxk to be quite the same style of film  this is much more of a for lack of better term dumb fun kind of film than minus one both to its advantage and detriment  not to mention up until the final act the film is almost strictly focused on kong and the humans to a lesser extent with goji himself halfliterally being dragged by the tail into the plot  the fights are extremely entertaining and action packed and the film kinda banks on that fact  the story is alright not as good as previous entries but not terrible though tying back to godzillas screentime it felt weirdly paced  the first half is rather slowpaced despite the comedic tones while the second half doesnt give anything time to breathe  ignoring the pacing issues this is a pretty fun film to see and frankly thats all that matters for the average joe
Mar 29 2024,positive,very entertaining tons of action good story line  great special effects
Mar 29 2024,positive,godzilla x kong was great action and new story was great new characters were enjoyable along with the returning characters hope we get more
Mar 29 2024,positive,i loved it that king kong  godzilla came together thru the help of mothra who let them know that they need to come together to save everyone and all thats around them from that  thats wants to be destroy or ruin i loved it
Mar 29 2024,positive,fun and entertaining havent seen a better movie in some time now
Mar 29 2024,positive,a real attention grabber the movie starts with action packed scenes thatll keep you in your seat and make you eat up those snacks amazing cgi and special effects that i just cant complain about adam is a true master when it comes to making titans come to life on the big screen  would love more to the monsterverse
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie was campy over the top and it was awesome in every way sure it has its flaws and people will compare it to godzilla minus one which was also good in its own right but this gives you everything you wanted in previous legendary godzilla films that you didnt get before nonstop monsters battling it out visually its a stunning movie also with lots of landscape changes and lights if you go in expecting an art house thriller action drama this aint it what it is though is a pure fun watch from beginning to end
Mar 29 2024,positive,ive been watching godzilla and kong movies since i was young now im watching new ones with my son and we are both having a blast
Mar 29 2024,positive,for what it is this movie was awesome as long as your not expecting a intricate plot and great dialogue then youll be more then happy watching monsters fight
Mar 29 2024,positive,loved the movie aside from these teenagers who dont know how to stay quiet nor stay in their seats during a movie it was lovely loved the teamwork from godzilla kong and mothra it was beautifully done
Mar 29 2024,positive,super action with super monsters 
Mar 29 2024,positive,godzilla x kong the new empire is a fun action packed movie although not better than its predecessor it still delivers what fans should expect from a godzilla and kong movie the movie also had great comedy overall 810
Mar 29 2024,positive,a very thrilling action movie blockbuster you cant go wrong with just multiple kaijus fighting each other and some dumb fun although the movie has some issues its just a very enjoyable experience through and through definitely recommend watching it in theaters especially imax
Mar 29 2024,positive,incredibly good amazing monster fights that are top notch in the monsterverse i loved it
Mar 29 2024,positive,movie was great from the start when kong is old now but i think godzilla was miss a bit and scar king was find and shimo very good the movie its very great and go watch will you can movie of the year for me
Mar 29 2024,positive,very fun and enjoyable movie for anyone who loves kaiju and action definitely worth it
Mar 29 2024,positive,i dont care what critics say this film is just fun and thats all it needs to be give us godzilla and kong action and thats it but they went farther giving so much emotion to these massive monsters which shouldnt be overlooked 1010 film imo just for the enjoyment
Mar 29 2024,positive,the most goofiest and action packed movie this year
Mar 29 2024,positive,its a crazy showa era godzilla fun if you were expecting something like minus one dont watch it cause youll be disappointed but if you like kong vs godzilla youll enjoy this
Mar 29 2024,positive,lots of fun highly enjoyed it
Mar 29 2024,neutral,good movie overall but if you are looking for a movie about godzilla this is not it this was a kong movie godzilla had little screen time and did a whole lotta nothing when he did great movie if you are a kong fan though
Mar 29 2024,positive,i wish my father was here to see this it was amazing
Mar 29 2024,negative,i just watched a great genre called kaiju perverted into a cheesy comic book super hero movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,as a fan i liked the movie unexpected plot
Mar 29 2024,neutral,so stupid yet so awesome
Mar 29 2024,positive,okay you know what youre getting into if youre a fan of these kind of films ive been in love with a monster franchise since i was a child so this movie was everything i could ask for   monsters fighting each other this was truly junk food and its finest turn your brain off and get ready to have some fun
Mar 29 2024,positive,badass movie godzilla is the king
Mar 29 2024,positive,mm awesome totally worth
Mar 29 2024,positive,i liked that there were more of the monsters and less of the human and i liked that kong got more respect and i cant wait to see what they do with the next movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,if im going to be 1000 honest that was the greatest monster movie ive ever seen and ive seen a lot of monster movies i actually think this may be my favorite movie of all time ive never had a number one favorite movie before and im so happy that it was this one
Mar 29 2024,positive,such a fun movie if you enjoy the godzilla franchise or giant monsters and general youll love this one there were quite a few heavyweight fights and plenty of scenes that had me laughing
Mar 29 2024,positive,i watched the movie yesterday in sweden the movie was gorgeous and the story was great 1010
Mar 29 2024,positive,it keeps you engaged the whole time its funny and the time goes by fast you forget the show is 2hrs long i will be going again
Mar 29 2024,positive,i liked the camera movement the action sound affects cg interaction it was good
Mar 29 2024,positive,the movies come across as more confident that bringing both some of the best and some of the craziest  out there stuff weve seen so far while retaining the quality of the series incl cgi    they fully commit both to decent and well tiedin human sections as well as the monsters having fleshed out journeys youll see only monsters on screen for 10s of minutes at a time  im happy to report that we have progressed miles from the old filmmaking style of cutting away from the monster fight scenes to see boring human segments
Mar 29 2024,positive,wery good movie awesome fight scenes cimenatogarphy musics cgivfx great probably with deadpool and wolverine and dune part 2 getting oscar nomimation  it gots ok plot and story but in the end in finnal battle spoilers      i would rather like to godzilla calling all monsters like rodan mutowhich were bowing in the end of kimg of the monsters to join the fight it is great but definetly better if this would happen
Mar 29 2024,positive,the fights are what carried this movie the people in it didnt really add a lot to the movie kong bearing other kongs with a baby king was the highlight of the movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,blockbuster movie super direction and it is just a great monsterverse movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,loved that it was action packed and got me engaged on whats happening and that we has more details about the monsters
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie is silly a bit incoherent at times but still freaking awesome the titan fights carried the film for me but its still a really good film in writing i wouldnt say the writing was good but not bad either the best monsterverse film period
Mar 29 2024,positive,best movie of the monsterverse
Mar 29 2024,positive,the king of the monster
Mar 29 2024,positive,after godzilla vs kong i think this movie is perfect sequel   but godzilla vs kong is masterpiece   big respect to direct and vfx team epic story telling  i loved it
Mar 29 2024,positive,what the monsterverse should have been  the fourth movie of the monsterverse has finally arrived the action has no limits a big difference between its previous installments being faster fights and not slower like pacific rim the human plot works well finally but taking the whole movie the titans as it should have been the music although it is not his forte works in the exact moments to set the scenes being untemas adapted for these movies being the same author the cgi is maintained having a great splendor without a doubt the monsterverse is getting better with each movie and leaves intrigue what will happen in the future
Mar 29 2024,positive,godzilla x kong the new empire was great godzilla like godzilla minus one was and i love to see mothra to make a comeback in this movie i hope they another monsterverse godzilla movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,switch off your brains for a while and smile at the massive entertainment really great like the old godzilla films from the 80s
Mar 29 2024,positive,hardcore godzillakong fans are in for a delight i laughed as much as i was throwing my hands in the air for all the kaiju madness what a ride
Mar 29 2024,positive,amazing movie and fight scenes
Mar 29 2024,positive,rating it within the context of the monsterverse godzilla movies it was pretty fricken epic best yet  i stopped watching the monarch after a few episodes due to its annoying characters a couple of annoying human characters in this they could have done a better job with but the in depth story monster story and final battle was amazing
Mar 29 2024,positive,exactly what u expect from a monster slug fest
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie was peak the critics know nothing and as a godzilla fan i loved this film out of 10 its 11 i love how it brought back aspects of the showa era films which is fantastic and you never get bored as there is always a monster scene not that far away a perfect film
Mar 29 2024,positive,it was known that we were going to see titans fighting almost the entire movie and so it was if you are going to see it with that in mind it is an excellent movieof course i would have liked a little more action from skar king because i didnt like relying on shimo as much and they will also explain how he can control her apart from that it seemed to me a good villain for the time it came out
Mar 29 2024,positive,best godzilla movie and underrated must watch brings alot of the fun and epic showa and hesei era vibs
Mar 29 2024,positive,i enjoyed godzilla x kong  from the nonstop monster fighting what do you expect to kong and suko i liked that this movie was cartoony vibe and vibrate colors overall this movie was great give me more monsterverse
Mar 29 2024,positive,omg this movie was phenomenal kong is the mvp this was thrilling fun action packed and the fight scenes were awesome
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie was a blast it had great action great kaiju battles and so much more
Mar 29 2024,positive,essentially a marvel movie with kaijus silly and ridiculous but never boring with a third act slugfest that hugely satisfies id rank it as one of the more entertaining and enjoyable entries in the monsterverse
Mar 29 2024,positive,greatgodzilla is still the god of all
Mar 29 2024,positive,absolutely fun monster action and great for the adult kid that wants played with the toys couldnt ask for a better and the relationship between the characters  monsters  phenomenal
Mar 29 2024,positive,loved the movie can watch it a million times
Mar 29 2024,positive,exciting high energy lots of eye candy with a spoonful of humor highly recommend
Mar 29 2024,positive,awesome movie for those who know what they are getting into the official critics seem like theyve never heard of a godzilla movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,if you want to see monsters fighting  this is the movie for you
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie is everything a monster movie should be its non stop action really fun to see will recommend and will see it again
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie is load of fun action packed and fun fun scene after scene critics may hate it but the audience love it although not as good as godzilla minus one this is still a fun movie to watch in the theaters unlike disney marvel  star war movies these days
Mar 29 2024,positive,the environment to watch the movie was great   you have to be a fan of this genre if not then you will not enjoy this movie i watched this in imax picture quality and sound were great
Mar 29 2024,positive,well i liked this movie what i would say to the director is to please give godzilla more prominence in the fight scenes because without godzilla the movie is nothing
Mar 29 2024,positive,it was awesome lots a good special effect and action it is a monster movie after all
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie is great if you like the monsterverse action this is your movie its action packed and has great villians to go against the greatest king kong and godzilla
Mar 29 2024,positive,movie was a fun action packed ride i mean its radioactive lizard fighting giant ape what more can you ask for 
Mar 29 2024,positive,this was great a lot of monster fights godzilla was in the movie a lot to me this was 100100 this movie was a blast  me and my mom love this movie king kong well he was a blast too funny jokes in this and a lot of people says that there was no godzilla that much man it feels like he was in this beginning to the end and king kong at the end was like he was the  well guys my official is this a best movie i ever seen 200200
Mar 29 2024,positive,its a really fun movie i loved godzilla and kong and with the last part of the movie being action packed and with the beautiful visual effects
Mar 29 2024,positive,iconic movie of all great films of all time 
Mar 29 2024,positive,not quite as good as godzilla vs kong but i had a great time regardless
Mar 29 2024,positive,a lot of monster battles and fun fantasy elements kong really steals the show but theres plenty badass moments for godzilla surprisingly the human characters were kinda likeable this time everyone made a good team  im just too grateful that we can have both overthetop and serious godzilla movies going on almost simultaneously
Mar 29 2024,positive,i fricking loved this movie so much action with big monsters fighting i loved everything cant wait for the next monsterverse movie
Mar 29 2024,negative,if you like mindless cheap expensive variation of the japanese original then this is your cup of tea it like the gvk is basically a kong story featuring godzilla and even though kong was the star some the side characters seemed more interesting and like gvk there are several 80s movies sports and video game references this is a one and done for us even couldve waited to see on the small screen
Mar 29 2024,positive,basically everything that monsterverse fans asked for  a nonstop action monster brawl with some great visuals  if anything it could have added just a little bit more human story and screen time  well worth the admission for godzilla kong and kaiju fans
Mar 29 2024,positive,this was a masterpiece i loved the movie with my friends keep it up legendary studios
Mar 29 2024,positive,this is just a beautiful movie to watch seeing the effects around hollow earth is just so good also kong and suko having a fatherson relationship is just a good touch for some upcoming movies if they keep making them also doug love that guy i wished he was in a couple shots more but im happy seeing the guy stealing kongs food also screw the people that say this movie sucks
Mar 29 2024,positive,absolute banger fuck this critics kinglion
Mar 29 2024,positive,the perfect kaiju film the fights are absolutely insane and theres a ton of them action begins at the start and doesnt end until the creditsabsolutely perfect
Mar 29 2024,positive,best action movie for godzilla and kong yet  actually could use just a bit more human involvement but still a high energy monster romp worth the admission
Mar 29 2024,positive,fun movie i went with some friends and everyone had a good time lots of monsters fighting and thats what you come to see
Mar 29 2024,positive,godzilla x kong the new empire was everything i hoped it would be it was an actionpacked blockbuster that delivered spectacle wonder and comedy     despite being a clash of the titans its really a kong and jia kaylee hottle story that delivers the feels of skull island and it makes some solid connections to that story soundtrack works wonderfully too in its actionadventure     the human characters beyond jia are of no real consequence  and thats okay because its not their story they serve their purposes  to move the plot and provide exposition but dan stevens as trapper is a standout     whats more in the age of epic movies kong x godzilla the new empire clocks in under 2 hours
Mar 29 2024,positive,this is the kind of godzilla kong movie the fans want more monsters more fights this is how you do a monster movie only little negative i can point out is i want to see more godzilla lol
Mar 29 2024,positive,not godzilla minus one but this was a fun ride from beginning to end
Mar 29 2024,positive,the movie has a lot of kaiju action and the human subplot does not feel overexposed like in past kaiju movies due to the fact that the kaiju action takes the show with many sequences of just kaijus
Mar 29 2024,positive,a little more then i bargained for some crossover incontinuities but in 40ish godzilla movies there has always been some variance even in toho  totally enjoyed it giggled at points and kinda got emotional at some points   cant wait to buy the dvd
Mar 29 2024,positive,i have seen a movie today im going to watch it tomorrow until then sunday monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday saturday sunday that is all you need to know 
Mar 29 2024,positive,i am a monster verse fan and i can bet you the average viewer will love this movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,they finally decided not to waste the big draw of the ipthe monsters i dont see the draw personally of character development and the like in a film like this if you do you might be more in line with the critic opinion if you want monsters and battles youll probably come out feeling more aligned with the audience score 1 star because i didnt like how some of the fight scenes were cut short the ending also felt slightly abrupt to me but i cant explain exactly why ill have to watch it again once available on home release to assess the ending again i just didnt leave saying that was so much better than godzilla vs kong so 4 stars for now
Mar 29 2024,positive,great continuation of the story plenty of action left the theatre satisfied
Mar 29 2024,positive,we loved this movie because it explained the full story of godzilla kong scar king mothra
Mar 29 2024,positive,this was a fun movie with plenty of monster madness the human characters were fun without taking away from the monsters beautiful scenery and an amazing music selection
Mar 29 2024,positive,it was a bit boring at times but i did like the action i do wish there was more godzilla but i still find this movie entertaining
Mar 29 2024,positive,insane is an understatement perfection
Mar 29 2024,positive,i finished watching the film a little while ago and its beautiful i recommend seeing it 
Mar 29 2024,positive,fight scenes in this movie are are amazing  the ploy is kinda wacky ngl but the human characters improved from the previous films   alot of funny moments skar king in this movie  is insane in a good way loved his character
Mar 29 2024,positive,this is the first and best godzilla and kong film i have watched in the theater i was as excited and hyped as i was for godzilla vs kong during the second half of the movie i found myself jumping out of my seat i had been so hyped and waiting for this movie ever since the teaser came out i thought it wouldnt live up to my expectations but boy was i wrong this movie is perfect for me
Mar 29 2024,positive,no spoilers this was an absolute great movie i loved it the cgi looked a tad off but the action made up for it this really gave off a showa era vibe because godzilla can literally hop i really liked the action but i think we could have gotten 1 more battle the final battle was good i really like the plot overall great movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,what a classic piece of art i have never seen such work before although you do not get much of thrill but there are many action full of adventure 
Mar 29 2024,positive,amazing movie superb vfx action choreography and screenplay were awesome only the dialogues felt cringe sometimes nonetheless a great watch
Mar 29 2024,positive,i just got done watching gxk is so good it made since sehmo was good sacr king was a good villain and i like godzilla upgrades it like good
Mar 29 2024,positive,fun action packed movie the giant monster movie kaiju fans have been waiting for cinematic funny and a great soundtrack highly rewatchable and will get better with every viewing i cant wait to watch it again
Mar 29 2024,positive,the movie was great  i love godzilla and the new kong movies are good   it does focus more on kong than godzilla  lots of monster fights good visual effects and overall good story   the movie was  spaced out well with no real long dull moments and had a good run time under 2 hours   i normally see movies i really like more than once in the theater and i am excited to see this in 3d the next time i see it
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie was fun just flat out fun
Mar 29 2024,positive,my favorite monsterverse film to date just straight up fun and funny i watched it on xd with dbox and 3d highly recommend it
Mar 29 2024,positive,this is definetely one of the best movies ive seen the effects the story the acting are all awesome
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie was awesome hands down the best movie so much action story was good and of course godzilla and kong are awesome 98100
Mar 29 2024,positive,the movie will sooth and excited our inner child of the fans as well as for those who just watched a monsterverse movie for 1st time the best thing about this movie is the action sequences its by far one of the best and thrilling actions i have seen in a movie there are few humor scenes of berney and titans which are well placed the cgi is awesome and its a must watch in imax  story wise its pretty good and fast paced but they did a good job based on the 1h 55m runtime in that sense the monsterverse team did a great job in adjusting story telling at the end of the day we r here to watch our fav titans fight and team up   worth the wait and one of the best movies so far in 2024 along witn dune 2
Mar 29 2024,positive,really fun movie also shouldnt be compared to minus one since gxk is just a fun and wacky  movie while minus one is a more serious movie  the only stuff i didnt like is the amount of godzillatiamatscar king and shimo screen time82100
Mar 29 2024,positive,best monsterverse movie definitely recommended
Mar 29 2024,positive,i just witnessed peak
Mar 29 2024,positive,a group of friends and myself got to see this movie in a packed 4dx theatre this newest addition to the series needs to be viewed on the big screen definitely a movie to bring your kids or friends to watch alongside the movie clocks in at under 2 hours is packed with the best fights scenes and really fleshes out king kongs back story while also making godzilla the strongest most invincible monster ever the ending is also very enjoyable as the pair of godzilla and kong are the heroes
Mar 29 2024,positive,godzilla x kong is a blockbuster that delivers exactly what it promises pulsepounding action brilliant visuals and epic spectacle this epic clash between two movie legends offers a thrill ride with terrific action and awesome visual effects
Mar 29 2024,positive,great fun film one of my favourite
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie is awesome  kong is the main focus of the movie  the cgi is little off compare to g vs k  maybe its a creative choice because all the kaiju s expressions are great
Mar 29 2024,positive,the best film in the monsterverse series
Mar 29 2024,positive,got exactly what i expected giant monsters epic battles sweet and simple kept me on the edge of my and i will be rewatching
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie needs at least 30 minutes more it was amazing  monsterverse needs to keep going 
Mar 29 2024,positive,its about what you would expect considering the direction that the monsterverse has been going  my favorite by far is still the 2014 godzilla
Mar 29 2024,positive,love monsters fighting monsters
Mar 29 2024,positive,watching it in imax was definitely my moneys worth the monster action and colorful worldbuilding was delivered beautilly though some fights couldve been slowed a bit through the human perspective and kongs plot arc clearly outshines godzillas but i wish the movie had time to breath some more plotwise its time kong takes the monsterverse helm for a while
Mar 29 2024,positive,best kong movie yet  godzilla was secondary but was powerful in every scene
Mar 29 2024,positive,i loved all off the action in the film in my opinion they did really well with kong but i think there should be more off godzilla in the film but he was incredible when on screen
Mar 29 2024,positive,the story visuals action sequences was amazing this movie packed a punch   its was so awesome to see godzilla and kong teamup and save the world again  the idea of merging monsterverse comics within the movie was a great move i had goosebumps the whole time i recommend you to watch in imax theatres thanks to adam wingard and team for making an awesome movie
Mar 29 2024,negative,things i liked about this movie  1 godzilla resting in the colosseum  2 kong using the kid as a weapon and the whole fight scene was just awesome    but unfortunately godzilla x kong is a strong drop in form after the previous film
Mar 29 2024,positive,its an over the top action packed movie its meant to be fun if you are looking for a crazy in depth story driven film this is not for you this is for godzilla and the monster universe fans
Mar 29 2024,positive,amazing i love how it is so actionpacked after the release of godzilla minus one which was dark and sad but an amazing film godzilla x kong feels like a breath of fresh air juxtaposing godzilla minus one perfectly i highly recommend watching it
Mar 29 2024,positive,honestly an amazing movie the action was great and the human characters were pretty likable also while some of the jokes are eh they did have some funny ones and even had a scene that made me laugh out loud eg spoilers when king kong used the little kong as a weapon against the other kongs
Mar 29 2024,positive,so fun too watch this movie i love goji

Mar 29 2024,positive,it was an awesome movie saw it last night it was a blast very subtle comedic timing between bernie and trapper was a nice lighthearted addition to a bruising kaiju donnybrook     i would challenge critics of this movie to go watch any movie series this deep into installments and find a better example of fan service or actually taking fans opinions in to account to improve the film franchise maybe the dceu would have been more successful if it wasnt ran by a bunch of suits who think they know what people should want as oppose to just actually giving people what they are asking for
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie wasnt meant for critics it was meant for the godzilla and kong fans that want to see some amazing monster brawls and effects i highly recommend this movie for those looking for a good 2 hours of nerding out easy 1010 in my book
Mar 29 2024,positive,i loved this movie huge godzilla fan here and this is how you make a godzilla movie  godzilla is finally getting the recognition   this movie was action packed godzilla may not be the main titan of a film like kong but his presences was ever felt    i loved the innocence  shimo displayed and definitely  loved when godzilla came face to face it was like he told shimo to freeze scar for kong this movie was so dope i am going to rewatch it again the new empire godzilla finally sees kong as an ally and morthra konggodzillamorthra  shimo  the next threat must be strong to be able to take on that empire
Mar 29 2024,positive,the action sequences were really rushed together but the visual effects were great scar king was really a scar flop
Mar 29 2024,positive,my son and i loved the movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,so much fun love the visuals and the monster action the film defiantly should have been longer so the human storyline wasnt so rushed and the final battle in rio should have been a lot longer still had a lot of fun
Mar 29 2024,positive,a lot of monster action no story and not very good editing
Mar 29 2024,positive,this was very entertaining and funny movie  wingard knew what he was doing when he made the movie  i would see it again
Mar 29 2024,positive,godzilla x kong the new empire takes the hol up let em cook to a new level it completely overtook my expectation 1010 for me mainly because it is both cartoony and action mixed into one that can make you feel like your in the movie itself if you imagine yourself in it and the cgi is chef kiss beautiful
Mar 29 2024,positive,this is a good movie much better than godzilla 1 and there is no point in comparing the two because this movie is much better and my only problem with this movie is that it is short but the monster scenes in that 1 hour and 55 minutes more than make up for it
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie was so good so many kaijus  this time around the kaijus finally take center stage
Mar 29 2024,positive,the plot built specifically to delve deeper into the roots of the two protagonists of the monsterverse immerses us totally in the underworld the parallelism that can be achieved between the surface and the underground is nothing other than the distant and irrelevant coexistence between godzilla and kong only an unexpected danger from a bleak and uncharted place will require the two enemy kaiju to bury the hatchet and fight together except for some scenes that are really too exaggerated it is often satisfying a fact that is not always a given even in 2024 the dynamism of the film is in perfect alignment with what has already been presented in the other monsterverse titles the human cast manages in this kaiju chaos to build its presence even if at least in this title of reduced depth and with a characterization paradoxically more indepth than the secondary characters of the group personally i found it very enjoyable but it is definitely not a movie for everyone
Mar 29 2024,positive,thats what i expect from a gxk movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,it was a fun movie with some flaws of course but when a movie is fun the negatives get put to the side and you just enjoy the constant fun that is this movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,thr movie the best and amazing
Mar 29 2024,positive,movie was fun to watch allot of monster mayhem and action definitely recommend

Mar 29 2024,positive,it was great i loved godzilla since i was a child  1010 would recommend and see it again
Mar 29 2024,positive,good ol fashioned monster mayhem and i loved every second of it
Mar 29 2024,positive,its a fairly entertaining movie carried by a likeable kong and good monster battles the other kaiju help keep the story afloat despite the belowaverage human characters if youre already into the monsterverse youll probably enjoy it
Mar 29 2024,positive,the people how hates im this they think its like minus one but its not grow up wannabe japanese people yes in talking to you my american views grow up minus is from japan monsters verse is america if you hate it then you have 0 movibuds
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie is a godzilla fans dream come true adam wingard really knows what the audience wants which is big entertaining kaiju fights
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie has some of the most compelling human characters in the franchise while still showcasing the epic monster action better than ever before truly a mustwatch and a masterpiece of monstercinema
Mar 29 2024,positive,amazing action sequences with i enjoyed just godzilla could have had more screen time but kong is the main focus praying for a kong solo film next but amazing scenes and suko and shimo i need more
Mar 29 2024,positive,i loved this movie great gight scenes and great super power teamup
Mar 29 2024,positive,i like how they threw the little kong around  he was annoying asf  deserved 1010 haters gnna hate i not gaffff
Mar 29 2024,positive,i thought the move was well done and i enjoyed it
Mar 29 2024,positive,i really love that movie and i like the scenes all of them my favorite part is the final battle
Mar 29 2024,positive,literally the funnest godzilla movie ive ever seen definitely a wild ride and good time
Mar 29 2024,positive,loved it big fan of the franchise hoping we get more soon
Mar 29 2024,positive,a classic blockbuster  fastpaced and overthetop visuals and action i mean its godzilla and king kong take the kids and have fun ignore all of the snarky film critics smashing this film  its not for them its for real people who like going to movies they only want to see poorly lit indy flicks that put everyone to sleep
Mar 29 2024,positive,a fun popcorn movie  critics are trash as usualnot everything needs to be a deep shakespeare experience  sometimes the suspension of belief and destruction at high volume is just what folks need  sit back grab your treats and enjoy a movie that wont make you think too much while entertaining you
Mar 29 2024,positive,its a great movie cause of all the fighting and it was just a fun ride to watch it all happen and i love the part were they collide head to head at the end kinda felt like avengers endgame
Mar 29 2024,positive,it is an entertaining movie full of action what many wanted the titans to be the protagonists it even has a funny plot of humans palomera if you can call it that and sails on the biggest screen dont be guided by what others say
Mar 29 2024,positive,i loved almost every second of the film it was overall amazing i would of liked more godzilla in the film
Mar 29 2024,positive,it was a fun movie i enjoyed it it gave me everything i want in a godzillakongmovie if youre watching a godzilla movie for human plot ur watching it wrong lol definitely a fun watch
Mar 29 2024,positive,very fun movie with two larger than life characters kong was the overall lead which was a fantastic choice loved seeing his character show some emotional depth just an awesome moviegoing experience that had my fellow audience cheering at the end
Mar 29 2024,positive,titan tag team  more to come
Mar 29 2024,positive,i loved this flick adam wingard gets kaiju action i just dont get or care about these stuffy critic takes ive watched every godzillakong movie out there minus one was truly great godzilla x kong is just righteous fun    fast paced right off the bat amazing colors similar to godzilla vs kong easy to literally see godzilla 2014 the human involvement in this movie was just enough and funny at times the music choices reminded me of guardians of the galaxy   there is no danielday lewis cameo for all of those insufferable character development cogs   if you likelove kaiju action go see this
Mar 29 2024,positive,if youre a fan of epic battles godzilla vs kong is the movie youve been waiting for while the human cast provides some comedic relief the real star of the show is the intense adrenaline rush delivered by the monstrous showdowns
Mar 29 2024,positive,extremely epic thrilling saga
Mar 29 2024,positive,had a fun time watching
Mar 29 2024,positive,amazing balls to the wall crazy modern take on the showa approach to godzilla kong gets a full arc and everything godzilla does is cool as hell wingard does some fun contrasting between titan and human perspectives human side of things isnt anything to write home about but its also enjoyable and inoffensive
Mar 29 2024,positive,this is an awesome dumb fun ride with a surprising amount of heart and packed to the brim with awesome action sequences
Mar 29 2024,positive,great and excellent movie i loved all of the battles and how they remixed one of godzilla vs kongs battle theme after all great movie and loved the detail
Mar 29 2024,positive,see film  is superlavitive monster movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie is so much fun and a blast please go out to see this movie you will not regret it of having a hell of a ride
Mar 29 2024,positive,wow an amazing continuance of the monsterverse  3d is the best ive seen  and executed perfectly for this film the 4d seat motion was a bit exaggerated  and took away from  screen attention at times as it shook soviolently for so long at times  detracting from the experience  see it in 3d  not 4d godzilla  kong forever 
Mar 29 2024,positive,is it great movie of course is not going to be as good as gkotm or minus onebut its great development story towards kong and gives it an exciting twist for the future now that kong and godzilla knows how to coexist
Mar 29 2024,neutral,its fun the action is great but i dont think its as good as its predecessors its definitely a step down in terms of quality the movie goes along way too fast to the point where you cant grasp a thing luckily the human characters werent annoying this time around another problem i had with the film was its heavy cgi usage this film was clearly meant to be a cash grab or a gimmick to roll in cash
Mar 29 2024,positive,10minute a small battle20munutes a hugebattlethats what we need in a kaiju movieand it did itawesome
Mar 29 2024,positive,this is a amazing cinematic movie for the monster verse so action packed with something different that delivers for sure
Mar 29 2024,positive,the critics are out of touch this movie was never intended to be masterful movie with great storytelling and amazing characters its goal was to be fun and entertaining and it succeeds this movie has more action and monster screen time than any other in the series very entertaining and fun to watch good movie to just turn your brain off and sit down and relax
Mar 29 2024,positive,it was pure fun and entertainment titans get the spotlight and humans provide good support
Mar 29 2024,positive,epic action at every turn
Mar 29 2024,neutral,the story was passable but the stakes just werent there
Mar 29 2024,positive,always the best of the best i hope to see a lot more of the monsterverse
Mar 29 2024,positive,you know exactly what you came here for and theres a lot of it hell yeah  my only complaint is the marketing revealed too much
Mar 29 2024,neutral,this film felt like it was only 30 minutes
Mar 29 2024,neutral,i absolutely loved the fightaction scenes they were amazing loved everyone but trapper and bernie movie wouldve been fine with them lol also the ending didnt feel right it felt like it shouldve been a bigger ending maybe next time oh and there was not enough godzilla the scene where he pops out of the ice  cgi isnt as good as kongs
Mar 29 2024,positive,just a bunch of giant monsters fighting and wrestling with each other what else could you want
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie was amazing i dont care what the critics say its so unfair that some people are comparing this movie to minus one 
Mar 29 2024,positive,the movie should be called king with some help from sidekick godzilla but i think that was the point it was a continuation of the find his family thread godzilla is a lone a rebel kong can talk sorta and has feelings  enjoyed the story and seeing it in dolby digital made it even better lots of destructions and some funny scenes related to godzillas travels go for the thrills and not the story
Mar 29 2024,positive,it made ma feel like a kid again i had so much fun and was filled with excitement and awe jam packed action and visually appealing
Mar 29 2024,negative,pretty sure the script was written by a 12 yo kid its time to end the monsterverse and reboot the saga
Mar 29 2024,positive,dumb fun what more is there to say i had fun with this movie and it felt like the showa era all over human plot was better than gvk but thats not a high bar i recommend it
Mar 29 2024,positive,one of the best western monsterverse movies yet purely by monster screentime alone the film doesnt hesitate to just focus on the kaiju story for long stretches with no dialogue i do wish godzilla had more character in this one and having spent the first half of the movie powering up i wish he was shown a bit stronger in the third act some pacing issues but still a dense entertaining two hours
Mar 29 2024,positive,we need way more movies like this for the next generation of godzilla fans
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie has everything weve wanted in a mv movie action and the respect for king kong godzilla was awesome in this movie his evolved form was cool but i wish they showed more of his evolved form but other than that he was awesome skar king was an amazing villain his personality really made him amazing same with shimo as well but cant lie i do think they shouldve shown them more but either way the movie was fantastic
Mar 29 2024,positive,just what youd expect and want to see in a monster movie more monster action was quite fast paced so if youre not into the franchise or have not the slightest idea of the concept then it might not be for you but visually it was amazing story is there and just enough to make the audience understand what is happening and lots  of titan screen time
Mar 29 2024,positive,it is an amazing movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,if you love giant monster movie fights then this is the perfect movie for you
Mar 29 2024,positive,such a good film its too bad madison nor someones in it although im glad bernie is back im really glad mothra gets resurrected and shimo was set free
Mar 29 2024,positive,holy hell this exceeded expectations excited to see where the monsterverse goes after this only way to get bigger is maybe spacegodzilla or maybe keizer ghidorah
Mar 29 2024,positive,good    very entertaining and action packed  alot of monsters scenes  not a lot of human nonsense    bad  kills off two cool titans that were in the mv  skar king and shimo dont get alot of screen time  godzilla needed more screen time
Mar 29 2024,positive,now if youre looking for a serious 2024 style godzilla movie then youre in the wrong place which kind of makes me sad because i loved that style and movie but if you just want to have a good time and nerd out on awesome 3d effects and huge monsters fighting then theres no better place than movie here have fun
Mar 29 2024,positive,just got out of seeing godzillaxkongthenewempire and i actually enjoyed it i felt like the producers actually listened to the fans and gave us more monster battles do you need to watch godzilla vs kong first yes but thats only if you care about the human side of the story which i kinda thought was weird rebecca halls character does 90 of the dialogue in this one but i loved the facial expressions that kong gave throughout this movie and how innovative he was and he has a total vegeta dragonball z moment in the moment in the movie and its great you actually find out why godzilla went supersaiyanrosé in this movie i enjoyed the bond between kong and lets just call him diddy kong it was kind of like a weird take on the relationship that kratos has with his son in god of war but the tag team of kong and godzilla was simply awesome this is one of those movies where you simply sit back and have fun overall its just a fun time at the movies and i honestly cant wait to see it again but in 4dx next time i give godzilla x kong the new empire 4 poundings of my chest out of 5
Mar 29 2024,positive,simple story but should have done better compared to its prequel godzilla vs kongthe antagonist wasnt that much of a threat infront of godzillakong tag team but yeahi have witnessed the hollow earth
Mar 29 2024,positive,we all know why we see these movies   to see larger than life kong and godzilla   think back 10 years ago and who would have thought we would be seeing kong and godzilla share a screen of this magnitude  now they team up and fight other monsters in great action scenes  bottom lineas long as you appreciate kong and godzillaits a dream come true    go see this now
Mar 29 2024,positive,great movie really liked godzilla and shimo though i wish the former had more screentime the only critique i have is that the finale kinda felt a bit rushed
Mar 29 2024,positive,really fun movie maybe not the best poetic movie as people continue comparing this movie to godzilla minus one but its a fun and awesome movie to just watch as a casual movie enjoyer
Mar 29 2024,positive,a very fun movie lots of action from the monsters and the human parts were funny and entertaining but im glad they put more focus on the monsters because in the end thats what im paying to see my kids loved it
Mar 29 2024,positive,had a great time with godzilla x kong for those saying it wasnt good while comparing it to minus one should automatically be discredited as they simply dont understand this is a completely different iteration of godzilla this movie is all about kaiju battles and it delivers the human element takes a back seat for the most part which works for what this film is aiming for what makes my review stop at 4 stars and not go higher is the very little screen time godzilla gets however when he is on screen he commands all the attention as he should buy a ticket get your popcorn sit back and enjoy the kaiju mayhem for two hours of fun
Mar 29 2024,positive,this is incredible the best movie of the year and the monsterverse the critics who shut up are scammers
Mar 29 2024,positive,i just came out of the cinema and i have to say i enjoyed it mostly it was quite funny at times and it had some great action scenes if youre gonna see it at any time then see it in your local cinema because the sound and picture quality is beautiful in a cinema
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie is exactly what i wanted it to be i attended a sold out imax screening and every kid laughed and cheered whenever the fights were onscreen    yes the humans take a backseat compared to 1 but thats how it should be the film takes itself as seriously as it has to considering its about a giant nuclear lizard and an ape    many of us grew up with rubber suit godzilla so if i saw this at 10 years old my mind would have melted it is the definition of a summer popcorn movie    excellent cgi and over the top battle scenes which feels like a 10 year old mashing together his action figures its anime mixed with godzilla    its perfect for what it is
Mar 29 2024,positive,very entertaining and the monsters are really the stars of the film its not high art cinema that is trying to promote any thoughts it just good old fashioned kaiju  action i love it for what it is and you should too
Mar 29 2024,positive,an awesome monster movie fully action packed it was almost perfect not many humans but funny ones a lot of titans great villain but as a godzilla fan i wouldve change some things
Mar 29 2024,positive,bro this is so damn fkin insane i didnt watch it yet but the monsterverses movies are the best movies for me so gxk is rll cool too i will comeback and say more after i watch the movie tomorrow
Mar 29 2024,positive,easily my favorite monsterverse movie after kotm
Mar 29 2024,positive,if you like fights then this is the movie for you a few comedic laughs from the human cast but the rest is pure adreniline from the monsters 
Mar 29 2024,positive,it was a lot of fun critics say there wasnt much godzilla in thisthere was a lot mainly a kong movie which is fitting for the universe this is in ignore the plot holes and enjoy the cgi kaijufest
Mar 29 2024,positive,the movoe was very spectacular the effectthe kaijus and the humanthe humans in this film are really well written and with crazy continuity in the stroylinethe battles between kaijus are very stunning with this oscarworthy effectsand thats all go and see it its fantastic
Mar 29 2024,positive,in my opinion the movie was awesome  wouldve liked it to be as long as gvk  some parts i did feel were a tad bit rushed and couldve used more light shine on but overall i loved it
Mar 29 2024,positive,talk about monsterverse mash up  this movie is fascinating and gets you glued on your screen      i recommend it  
Mar 29 2024,negative,such a boring film5 min of godzilla 60 mins of kong and the rest human garbage and terrible things that ruin the monsterverse i mean they hyped up the scar king for possibly the worst end fight ever just changing locations every minute and terrible acting possibly the worst film ive seen in 2024 and i watched saltburn on a serious note it ruins what gvk built and disregards skull island and makes ghidorah weak when in reality hes the strongest titan complete garbage and waste of a great villian
Mar 29 2024,positive,its an incredible movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,godzilla x kong is a fantastic ride from start to finish i look forward to seeing much more from the monsterverse
Mar 29 2024,positive,a movie im proud to have watched  its fun and entertaining kong and boi had a great little dynamic if you like godzilla or kaiju its easily a need to watch
Mar 29 2024,positive,movie was awesome from beginning to end much more monster tie than human time loved it the playlist was great as well a must watch
Mar 29 2024,positive,this is definitely the best godzilla or kong movie i have ever seen  its funny in all the right places it is intense it is enjoyable and it is a great movie  highly recommend it
Mar 29 2024,positive,if you liked godzilla vs kong then you will love this  even more kaiju fighting action with stunning visuals and all in all a fun time
Mar 29 2024,positive,as expected a storyline that you shouldnt think too much about but the fighting between all the monsters is fantastic which is exactly what i want
Mar 29 2024,positive,i dont care what anybody says this movie was amazing  it was stupidly hilarious and fun the kaijus had a lot more screen time and many great fighting sequences
Mar 29 2024,positive,omg this movie is the movie of the year great movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,the movie didnt really break much new ground in terms of the monster verse but it was a fast paced joyride that has more heart and soul than any other new action adventure films
Mar 29 2024,positive,great titan action loved the showa feel and overall fun of the film id hug wingard if i could for showing us his love for all things godzilla and the monsterverse theres definitely more of a story that needs to be told and i hope he continues to be the one to tell it
Mar 29 2024,positive,storyline was original and great great surprise for those that are godzilla fans kongs show of attitude and body language is very understandable and a great idea made it easily seem like you were watching humans fightshow dominance instead of monsters
Mar 29 2024,positive,it was action packed and fun
Mar 29 2024,positive,the film is best on the big screen but the stories are getting weaker with every sequel     still it is a spectacle and seeing it at home just wont slap the same way see it in theaters
Mar 29 2024,positive,godzilla x kong takes the lessons it learnt from godzilla vs kong to create an interesting entertaining kaiju brawl that didnt have any dull moments throughout its runtime    the plot centers around the monsters and you know what each of them godzilla and kong are doing and how theyre working towards their own goals    we see some returning members who did a decent job of providing explanation and detail with some witty banter thrown it however the scenes with kong and his new friend suko are what sells the movie    im looking forward for what comes next to kong godzilla and co as i think the monsterverse found its footing
Mar 29 2024,positive,it was awesome exactly what i wished for if people think otherwise i suggest you watch it again yeahhhh
Mar 29 2024,positive,i had a lot of fun with this movie definitely my new favorite monsterverse movie its everything i wanted from a monsterverse movie because the movie is practically a long ass fight scene the only downside to it is that godzilla didnt get that much screen time and the fights he had with scylla and tiamat were super fast
Mar 29 2024,positive,i thought godzilla x kong the new empire was a awesome movie the plot was fun and the cgi was great most people dont like the human elements of the movie but i think this movie got all of the human stuff out of the way so that godzilla and kong can fight together but i thought scar king wasnt a worthy villain he got thrown all over the place minor spoilers but scar king uses shimo as a gun shimu carries the fight on scar kings team also the title cards saying where we where when we went to a different area i didnt mind it at the end of the movie i couldve stayed for another hour but thats just my opinion but overall i think godzilla x kong the new empire is awsome totally recommend it
Mar 29 2024,positive,so fun and entertaining dont compare to minus one
Mar 29 2024,positive,awesome movie with great action sequences and humor the ending was a little underwhelming but the movie itself was very entertaining all the way through
Mar 29 2024,positive,a good movie but to much action
Mar 29 2024,positive,it was fast moving fun great action great call back to the old movies  loved it
Mar 29 2024,positive,dont mind the critics reviews this is going down as one of my favorites of the godzilla  kong movies was none stop thunder lightning monster bashing  has everything you need and more in this amazing sequel i loved it
Mar 29 2024,positive,great movie for what it is and doesnt take itself too serious  my only critique is although the godzilla and kong scenes were great i feel like the godzilla scenes could have been extended an extra few minutes per scene     other than that it was a fun movie and i hope the monsterverse continues and hopefully we get another solo mv godzilla movie again
Mar 29 2024,positive,gxk was everything i wanted from this movie i had a big grin in my face the whole movie just kaiju vs kaiju action
Mar 29 2024,positive,its way better than some are sayingyes theres lack of dialogue asides from plot advancement but to me thats fine for this moviekong takes center stage and is done justice compared to previous movie the villain on a power scale lacks but makes up with wits and personality   wingard nails the visuals with the colors though this movie is not without its flaws with some questionable cuts and a noticeable feeling of fan service with the return of a fan favorite godzilla x kong improves on all the things from the first one and hope the franchise continues
Mar 29 2024,positive,really great movie probably my favorite out of monsterverse so far best to watch in imax
Mar 29 2024,positive,just got out of godzilla x kong the new empire and i loved every second of it if you want a big monster epic with lots of cool visuals this will be right up your alley human character this time around were pretty enjoyable and didnt take away from the monster action and were actually funny this one really does feel like kongs story but when godzilla does show up its always a treat all the fights seemed like something out of a saturday morning cartoon but in a good way because thats what i wanted to see if you like the previous monsterverse installments i think youll end up liking this
Mar 29 2024,positive,was hooked from beginning to end action packed and funny as well i was not expecting to be as thoroughly entertained as i was
Mar 29 2024,positive,an incredibly fun film i left the theater very satisfied
Mar 29 2024,positive,absolutely amazing brought all elements of past godzilla eras into one amazing movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,loved it big long showa era monster fights beautiful graphics and some funny moments from burny and catcher gia and rebecca was cool too godzilla and kong were epic and see them alot in this movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,plotline does feel a little rushed but no one goes to a godzilla movie for the human drama they go for the kicka monster fights and boy does it deliver on those all around good movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,i had fun  thats all i want in a movie now  it was a little slow in the beginning but the end battle is kaiju glorious  
Mar 29 2024,positive,a showastyle action packed movie that delivers on on monster screen time love that big lizard
Mar 29 2024,positive,movie felt a bit rushed in the second half but otherwise was great fun to watch
Mar 29 2024,positive,really good movie i didnt think it would be good but it was a really good movie good fighting scenes good story too
Mar 29 2024,positive,best movie of the decade1010    legendary pictures unbelievable job adam wingard      did directing this   he nailed this movie directing it   my husband and i were on the edge of our seats     spoiler    mothra was a incredible thing to see as a addition to this     spoiler    the scene when godzilla and kong dropped and emerged running then seen the bad ape riding the ice dragons back so kong jumped on godzillas as they charged was epic it left me speechless    if critics or any 1 trys to down this movie im loosing all faith in humanity     please  god let there be another sequel and i promise ill start church on sundays      thank you again legendary pictures we needed this movie big time    any 1 who gives less then 5 stars and complains well you can go back to 8 mile with your box of twinkies and finish your fairy odd parents show  this is nothing less then a master piece
Mar 29 2024,neutral,i saw the new kong godzilla movie it was good and not good    the good fight scenes were epic thats basically it for the good where kong lived the background cgi was horrible the deaf girl in the movie drove me crazy she was literally one dimensional always looking sad except for maybe 2 min of screen time at the end     i highly recommend watching for the epic battles not the story
Mar 29 2024,neutral,a fun monsterpalooza that gets dragged down once again by the human aspect of the story this has been the formula and a huge point of contention against this franchise since 2019s king of the monsters  it really is unfortunate because the monsters in this movie are awesome and deserved a heck of a lot more screen time than what was given the monsters have always been the highlight of this franchise but they always want to try and get too cute with the human elements of these movies it has always backfired on them and this is no different  the movie overall looks good but i feel the cg was crisper and more polished in the previous installment of this franchise especially with the wide shots of the monsters all that said though they did do a great job with the closeups of the monsters theyre able to make kong emote extremely well he could have carried this film with no dialogue to be honest that would have been a more captivating flick   with that being said the movie we did get was slow and boring for a good chunk of it the humans once again in an effort to progress from plot point a to plot point b drag this story down the momentum and energy really gets vacuumed out when the story shifts to them   the human characters of this story once againdo their usual schtick and are not very interesting the characters dont add much quality to the overall package theyre all very one dimensional straightforward and bland   the monster action is awesome and needed more time yes we get kong traversing the sprawling landscape but that goes on for too long and theres not much action there we get it hollow earth is big that has already been established it doesnt get to introduce a new aspect of this world until halfway into this movie sadly its just huge cg landscapes until then   we needed more kaiju battles thats what brought us into the theater they needed to showcase more of their monster world and further expand on that they dont need human characters in this story ruining the movie with bland dialogue and development honestly a straight cg animated film with all the monster goodness is what i need give me ninety minutes of kong and godzilla fighting then having to tag team to destroy an even bigger threat make the humans the fodder they were meant to be
Mar 29 2024,positive,i really love this movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,exceptional i was thrilled the whole time

Mar 29 2024,positive,i was entertained albeit not the best entertainment out there but i still got what i desired to see i wanted to see more monsters battle and that is what this film delivers there is less human character building and more time spent with the monsters kong primarily and the other monsters this is nice given the prior films have always tried to build character depth to the humans and dont do a bad job yet after many films of that formula its nice to just have a film focused more on the monsters theres is always action going on some nice music here and there its a decent popcorn flick
Mar 29 2024,positive,its a fun silly flick
Mar 29 2024,positive,such a fun entertaining movie best movie in the monsterverse series the colors the music the titans and the mayhem loved it

Mar 29 2024,positive,mothra that is all
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie was peak unlike the 2014 movie godzilla x kong the new empire shows the magic of the showa and millennium eras we love so much godzilla was awesome kong was perfect and all the other monsters had lots of good cameos and appearances its amazing that they had so much time to show all these monsters in such a 1hr 55m film i still think if the humans had a bit more understanding than fans speculate the film wouldve been peak this film is definitely enjoyable and i cant wait for more of godzilla and kong
Mar 29 2024,positive,it was the godzillakong movie i wanted to see ton of monster action coherent story and relatively good human story
Mar 29 2024,positive,amazing non stop fun ignore the rotten critics
Mar 29 2024,positive,you get what you pay for  tons of action big monsters great cgi roaring sound what else do you want human element always lack in these movies but we already know this see it for the monsters
Mar 29 2024,positive,an absolute blast professional critics are so out of touch this is not shakespeare this is a silly movie about giant monsters mayhem and boy it delivers go and see it and rebel in the madness of it all just wonderful
Mar 29 2024,negative,disappointed  no continuity in the story line very corny scenes of monsters talking to each other they were so bad our audience was laughing at them worst godzillakong ever
Mar 29 2024,positive,its a bit slow at first  theres not much godzilla and some the human scenes are a bit dull but the movie makes up for it with plenty of monster mayhem an absolute recommend for kaiju fans
Mar 29 2024,positive,great movie i just watch it and i really like it
Mar 29 2024,negative,this latest installment has reached an alltime high of boredom and stupidity at this point who really cares anymore

Mar 29 2024,positive,fk u criticsthe movie is absolutely fine
Mar 29 2024,positive,just witness 2 hours of my night seeing godzilla  kong fighting other monsters  it was amazing love the stack of human casts  great entertaining actionpack ride that puts a smile to my face peak cinema however i wished we saw more of godzilla  scar king because the fast pace of the film does not support the growth and screen time to the other characters involvements overall had a great time in cinema  putting this in 2nd place of the monsterverse films
Mar 29 2024,positive,the film is the perfect film that the fans need to see  a lot of fun and epic battles without interference of humans
Mar 29 2024,positive,toning back the amount of human characters who were uninteresting and irrelevant let the main story line work far better and the fight scenes were sick
Mar 29 2024,negative,terrible acting not serious about the cities being destroyed people dying and not serious or concerned introducing a baby ape just terrible all the way around     good special effects though
Mar 29 2024,positive,if youre looking for oscar worthy performances and a superb storyline this is not the movie for you on the other hand if youre like me and you go into this movie just looking for some action great set pieces and most of all lots of godzillakong mayhemthen this movie will be a treat if you love the old monsterverse movies then this movie is for you
Mar 29 2024,positive,definitely one of the better godzillakong movies i would say godzilla minus one is the top movie but this isnt far behind
Mar 29 2024,positive,tons of monsters fights me happy
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie was a masterpiece
Mar 29 2024,positive,outstanding visual  good background music   mass elements avg story
Mar 29 2024,positive,best of the monsterverse movies  a true presummer popcorn film that had me cheering the whole time  kong and godzilla make a wonderful odd couple pair now that we are seeing that kong has some sentience and agency  i will see this several more times in the theaters  you will miss out on a lot of the enjoyment if you wait for streaming  this one is a great watch
Mar 29 2024,positive,to be honest this is one of the most enjoyable monstershowdown movie ive ever seen it shows the genuine personality of the titans with humans being the side characters definitely an enjoyable 2hour show for me
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie is all what ive waited for its peak cinema and actionpacked this is what people will enjoy the most highly recommended film and its a lot of fun
Mar 29 2024,positive,it will be more cool if it got a lot more of backstory overall its fun to see its a monster movie what are you expecting
Mar 29 2024,positive,if youre looking for a movie with good story with great monster fights then this is the movie you need to see
Mar 29 2024,positive,this was purely a fun popcorn summer movie not much thinking needed purely a visual feast that will please old and new fans of both kong and godzilla
Mar 29 2024,negative,godzilla minus everything a complete spaghetti mess of a movie
Mar 29 2024,neutral,the movie promised action and it delivered on that but it failed to give us a reason to care about whats happening on screen with severe pacing issues and not a trace of character development it leaves a lot to be desired in terms of memorability fans of the older japanese godzilla films will be delighted to see the two eponymous monsters together on screen but its in my opinion far from what the monsterverse should be capable of at its best it also fails to sufficiently build from its predecessor godzilla vs kong to not feel as the same film repackaged with a more lavish 3d landscape
Mar 29 2024,positive,best godzilla movie ever action from the first minute what made it great for me is little to no human interaction it was a monster bash
Mar 29 2024,positive,godzilla x kong the new empire is the most favorite and most badass movie since i watch godzilla vs kong and godzilla king of the monsters the movie is badass and battles and fatal are so deadly but epic combat style    plus i see mothras new look design and shes the most beautiful since i see her in king of the monsters her abilities are the greatest and awesome
Mar 29 2024,positive,i loved this a couple hours of loud monsters and giant apes plot holes yeah but who cares this was big fun
Mar 29 2024,positive,went there to see monsters fighting thats what i got and was a blast godzilla and kong were bad ass seeing mothra again was a treat if ya wanna be entertained go
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie is an epic thrill ride for anybody with an interest in kaijus fighting dont miss it for anything in the world     yes of course some things are goofy what do you expect
Mar 29 2024,positive,its the most amazing and badass movie ever i love godzilla new form and kongs new beast glove im side with both team godzilla and kong       ill give them 1000000000
Mar 29 2024,positive,this anticipated kaijusized blockbuster delivers epic action and fun for any fan of the classic beasts proving that the monsterverse did the right thing steering into the more lighthearted and showaera tone
Mar 29 2024,positive,if you know what you want to see and that involves a wayyyyy overthetop plotline full of convenient coincidences human scientists who know with almost bored certainty the inner thoughts and desires of giant monsters and slowmotion posterworthy super mega fighting force kaiju now with weapon accessoriesthen youre probably not even reading this and youre already at the theater  enjoy
Mar 29 2024,neutral,the movie had some of the most contrived plot ever in a godzilla movie i get it its supposed to be fullout action but theres plenty of actually well written action blockbusters to watch instead and the action isnt even that competent especially in the last battle the structure was horrendous too  kongs interactions with the apes were a highlight though sukos little redemption arc was nice to see but the eponymous godzilla got less focus than him a bit underwhelming
Mar 29 2024,positive,much like how godzilla minus one was masterfully crafted in its genre adam wingard is becoming somewhat of a master in cooking up the perfect kaiju popcorn entertainment a simple story thread just tangible enough to hang creative world building and rock em sock em throw down events on clocking in just shy of 2 hours this movie doesnt demand more of your day than it needs and packs all the heart charm and primal monster violence into its runtime
Mar 29 2024,positive,the movie never felt boring but the plot did have some missing points
Mar 29 2024,positive,so much fun for the family
Mar 29 2024,positive,fun and imaginative action wildly colorful and filled with life even if the mayhem is mindless its not soulless the dynamic between kong and suko in particular is highly charming to watch develop  my main gripe with the film is the structure particularly for its set pieces which are all backloaded a bit into the movies last third and the villains suffer slightly from being introduced so far into the second act although that did not diminish how well animated and characterized they were
Mar 29 2024,negative,theres no going back isnt it godzilla 2014 was grounded and presented a world where we were insignificant godzilla and the other monsters were a force of nature and it gave me a sense a wonder i havent felt since jurassic park but every monsterverse movie after that has kept dumbing down the material for all its flaws king of the monsters still treated the monsters with respect but these two adam wingard movies treat them like cgi toys theres not even a sense of weight or size something gareth edwards achieved so successfully ill give them credit at least the story had some thought this time unlike godzilla vs kong but the execution left much to be desired you cannot put godzilla 2014 next to these two movies and tell me they belong to the same universe with a straight face and i know which one of them i prefer yes godzilla can be serious or camp or anything in between but at least have consistency in your approach and the universe your supposedly building
Mar 29 2024,neutral,the monsters are good with the exception of one which is a colossal plot pretext the interactions of human beings are bad the film never takes off and by the end there are too many questions it could have been done better
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie is just for the godzilla nd kong lovers thats it we ask in previous movies that we want less human more kaiju they give us that but humans species will never satisfied  i just love how godzilla  look i just love shimo nd we love kong so we need this kind of stuff in future as well
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie is a thrilling action packed movie all around the story is very interesting snd the monsters look great amazing movie 5 stars
Mar 29 2024,positive,its not what i think about the movies its what i think about rottentomatoes like in medicine field there are neurologist cardiologist etc similarly there should be separate critics according to the type of movies you know what i mean thats why the score is 56  godzilla has nothing to do with it neither do kong because kong bows to noone
Mar 29 2024,positive,this move is very entertaining and very fun it is epic and it is totally worth watching great kaiju battle
Mar 29 2024,positive,i absolutely loved this movie the cgi was really good and the kaiju fights were awesome and exciting if you like the showa era then you absolutely should watch this movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie was absolutely incredible everything the trailer told us is what the film is its silly and really just a popcorn movie this by far one the best monster verse films and im so glad the monster verse is still around godzilla in this movie was absolutely phenomenal as always he was kicking some ass every time he was on screen i loved it the humans side of the story was actually okay this time around i was always hooked in when a human scene came on this movie is all centred on kong which i love he gets to explore and find his people after so long and im glad hes not alone anymore suko was the star of this movie he was absolutely amazing loved every scene he was in shimo is by far one of the best titans in the monster verse she amazing in this film i hope to see more of her in the future skar king is one of the best villains in the monster verse he is very intelligent something the other titans havent really come across skar king surprised me a lot in this movie as the trailers did make him look weak but no skar king is absolutely one of the best villains in the monster verse
Mar 29 2024,positive,thats movie is awesome to watch it on cinema
Mar 29 2024,positive,adam wingard did it again espectacular kaiju action and lots of fun the monster movie we were waiting for
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie is just fun plain and simple its exactly what i expected  a giant brawl that doesnt take itself seriously and really harkens back to showa era godzilla films i do wish we got a little more godzilla as always but the kong story was very well done i have some nitpicks about pacing especially toward the end but overall i got exactly what i wanted and it really made me feel like a kid again i had a smile on my face the whole time see this on the biggest screen possible and get ready for a spectacle  its a blast to watch
Mar 29 2024,positive,i think it was amazing especially the colours were so rich and i never taught it wouldve gotten this better i highly recommend to watch dont listen to what people say  the only negative thing i can say is that it was short i was expecting it to be 3 hours thank you legendary
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie delivers what we craved in the pastmore titans screentime and less humanpeople who are comparing it to minus one need to start thinking about their ability to be a reviewerwatched first dayfirst show and omg  it delivered what we all wanted more kaijus and there insane battles    and to the director i would say we want more monsterverse mr wingard
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie is spectacular so please dont listen to critic reviews in addition this isnt godzilla minus one dont go in thinking its godzilla minus one its suppose to be fun and over the top
Mar 29 2024,positive,2 hours of non stop fun also mothra didnt die for once so that was great
Mar 29 2024,positive,peak kaiju cinema easily the best modern godzilla movie along with extremely impressive cgi and fight choreography
Mar 29 2024,positive,movie gave what it promised amazing cgi popcorn entertainment and edge of the seat action idc about anything else
Mar 29 2024,positive,we are so fortunate to be in a time where special effects sounds storytelling and amazing creatures are brought to life for us to enjoy    the creatures were the main actors in this movie with human characters as a supporting cast    it worked nicely for this movie    giant titan action  variety of titans and creatures  decent actors  amazing effects    this move has all that and some decent acting by the human cast as well    hopefully the monsterverse keeps producing these different style movies that have something for everyone to enjoy    one very refreshing feature i am enjoying are the monsterverse titans and creatures    it is nice to have our old favorites but the addition of new monsterverse titans is fantastic    thanks for the thrill ride adam wingard    very entertaining an imax must see
Mar 29 2024,positive,a spectacular nonstop actionpacked monsterfilled thrill ride instant classic
Mar 29 2024,negative,godzilla x kong is exactly what i thought it would be from trailers and early reviews monsterverse is a mess godzilla is a complete afterthought and seemingly undergoes a design change to  sell toys that is all good and well but just feels like something i love being turned into a joke and bled dry for money ive seen comparisons to the showa era and i think that is an insult to those movies ive seen every godzilla movie made to date and this one goes immediately in the bottom 5 of all time
Mar 29 2024,positive,i loved it had great monster action a good storyline and even some funny moments long live the monsterverse
Mar 29 2024,positive,it was just what everyone expected it be a kaiju brawl of the ages the humans also added a bit of depth to the lore and the story but in the end it was all about the monsters and the movie deliver just that i hope the monsterverse continues
Mar 29 2024,positive,human characters were pretty much 1dimensional storyline not much better 3d effect was very good most of the time but the fast action sequences were hard to focusdistinguish
Mar 29 2024,positive,if youve been a fan of all the monsterverse movies thus far then gxk the new empire is a nobrainer actionpacked monster battles likable human characters and enough backandforth between the two to give us a coherent storyand the monster carnage we love
Mar 29 2024,positive,the movie was a solid 8510 kong had so much more respect than in gvk plus he met suko wich was an awesome bonding plot godzilla was a menace even with the smaller screen time he had mothra had an amazing comeback and skar king with shimo were solid villians    now the negatives have to be the humans again they werent bad but they kind of clashed with the monster plot too much exept jia she had to be included   the cgi mostly looked good but some shots felt off the movie also felt really short despite the 114 minutes runtime wich is kinda sad     looking past the negatives that are significantly overshadowed by the positives this movie great and an awesome addition to the monsterverse
Mar 29 2024,negative,it looks like a computer game
Mar 29 2024,positive,dont listen to critics nowadays they just give random ratings  movie was really good wait for godzilla x kong was worth it vfx were really nice and hats of to the writers they really made a exciting yet interesting storyline for the movie    cant wait for next installment of monsterverse
Mar 29 2024,positive,an absolute love letter to the showa era of godzilla kong was awesome and his story was a treat the humans were consolidated significantly to allow the kaiju to shine and it works campy shlockey over the top monster bash fun as a super fan of godzilla this movie is made for fans perfect
Mar 29 2024,positive,a film that fulfills the fact that godzilla and kong will come out together in which the titans appear more than the humans and the titans share themselves in the most spectacular and impressive fights and crushes all the human drama and we move on to the titan drama 1010 
Mar 29 2024,positive,loved it must watch in theaters
Mar 29 2024,positive,wb is gonna have a heck of an year cause look at their movies  first with dune2 and now with godzilla v kong and they still have 2 more movies left this year     they will eat pretty good and coming to this movie    it was really great and they are human characters  i heard someone sayin this movie focuses solely on monsters were wrong      they are some characters and they are nicely written on screen ps  this movie wont look good in mobiles  tv screens  it has to be witnessed only in big screen 
Mar 29 2024,positive,the movie was great i thought it was a very fun moviemy only little problem was godzillas screen time but every time he was on screen i cheered
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie was amazing from start to finish kong was great in the fight scenes with the skar king and godzilla was the star of the movie it sounded so good in xd at the cinemark the seats were thumping everytime godzilla and kong moved what a great movie i will definitely see this again
Mar 29 2024,positive,big lizard and big ape fights big lizard and big ape with plenty of additional guest monsters beautiful visuals what else matters in a monster rumble movie nothing doesnt need to be clever well written or deep we just want the monster fights thats all that matters this should be 90100 fresh just on that criteria alone go see it its amazing
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie is dope this is for the real fans when they first started this stuff i dont go by critics i go by myself and i already know this movie is going to be awesome so im giving it all the stars i possibly can you have to be a real fan to love this you have to follow these monsters when you were a child and i can relate
Mar 29 2024,positive,2 hours of absolute action and spectacle with some of the best kaiju action of any movie in the genre if youre a fan of monster movies youll absolutely love this one
Mar 29 2024,positive,roar roar monke monke yonnnnke rooaaaar sakroorsh the entire sound of gxk
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie was a rollercoaster of happiness and awesomeness there was not a dull moment at any point of this movie if you want to watch a movie about giant monsters fight with amazing visuals than this is the movie for you i remember crying tears of happiness for how awesome with movie was hail to the kings
Mar 29 2024,positive,great movie so much awesomeness from start to finish
Mar 29 2024,positive,some of the cgi was mid but the monsters and monster fights were pretty cool seeing mothra was my favorite and baby kong was silly plot was meh acting was decent minus some awkward dialogue it felt pretty rushed maybe good for those with short attention spans but it was funentertaining overall
Mar 29 2024,neutral,every fight in this was short there was one move that godzilla did on kong wwe and that was really laughable
Mar 29 2024,positive,big blockbuster entertainment in its purest most joyful form many critics seem to be reviewing the film for what it isnt and isnt trying to be instead of what it is which is the most satisfying fun blockbuster since no way home in my opinion
Mar 29 2024,positive,awesome monster fights trash in a totally good way moments godzilla kong surprises and thats not all absolutely loved it
Mar 29 2024,positive,great action best monsterverse movie so far
Mar 29 2024,positive,fx were awesome good storyline with good action waited a while for this  was happy with the movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,i know the movie has many illogical explanations and unimportant human scenes but im loving every time they showed us the monster parts we get what a monster movie should be
Mar 29 2024,positive,thats what we want great movies 
Mar 29 2024,positive,wonderful movie with perfect action great balance between the kaijus story and the humans
Mar 29 2024,positive,it was so much fun another very enjoyable movie kong and godzilla both had great scenes although godzilla didnt have much im not mad as it was obvious from the getgo   i loved gvk and now i love gxk i havent had this much fun with a movie in a very long time im not saying its perfect but thats a given dont compare this to minus one
Mar 29 2024,negative,i dont trust the audience score at all on this one  trash movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,as a lifelong fan of kaiju cinema i can confidently say that godzilla x king kong the new empire delivers on every front igniting the screen with a fivestar spectacle of epic proportions from the moment the titans clash the film captivates with its breathtaking visual effects seamlessly blending cgi mastery with the beloved practical effects that define the genre    the director expertly navigates the delicate balance between homage to the classics and innovative storytelling paying respectful tribute to the iconic characters while injecting fresh life into their timeless rivalry the narrative unfolds with pulsepounding intensity keeping audiences on the edge of their seats as godzilla and king kong face off in jawdropping battles that redefine cinematic spectacle    but its not just the battles that shine the film also boasts a compelling storyline that delves into the deeper themes of power humanity and the delicate balance between nature and civilization the characters are fleshed out with depth and emotion ensuring that the audience forms a genuine connection with these largerthanlife creatures    moreover the films stellar cast delivers standout performances bringing authenticity and heart to their respective roles whether its the stoic presence of godzilla or the fierce determination of king kong each character is brought to life with nuance and gravitas    in conclusion godzilla x king kong the new empire is a triumphant celebration of everything that makes kaiju cinema great its a mustsee for fans old and new delivering an unforgettable experience that will leave you roaring for more long live the kings
Mar 29 2024,positive,they fixed kongs character in this movie and really gave him a glow up he became a gigachad
Mar 29 2024,positive,overall good fun the only thing i didnt like was how humanlike the titans communicated also tsucos cgi is pretty terrible
Mar 29 2024,positive,probably best monster verse movie i seen if you are fan of the old school godzilla movies you will love this one
Mar 29 2024,positive,everyone was good and nice sound and 3d effect
Mar 29 2024,positive,godzilla x kong the new empire is amazing love it from the beginning to the end is a movie that you need to see in the big screen monsters action nonstop and the human element were great but in this you going to see a lot monster screen time and we here for that  and if you are worried about the critic reviews dont pay any attention to them they only thing is to hurt the movie with bad score make you think the movie is bad and lie because the movie is amazing
Mar 29 2024,positive,just an absolute fun time will definitely see it multiple times
Mar 29 2024,positive,i enjoyed the action sequences felt more of a kong movie then godzilla
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie is everything a godzilla fan could hope for lieten close critics are idiots dont listen to the professional critics audience vote is way more accurate  this movie gave me everything i could ever ask for out of a massive kaiju fight film the villain is ruthless and terrifying kong is emotionally driven and very easy to love and godzilla is just pure brute strength this movie is absolutely incredible
Mar 29 2024,positive,the movie was all i needed from the monster verse just epic fights
Mar 29 2024,positive,it was super fun fight scenes were amazing
Mar 29 2024,positive,jokes werent funny human story wasnt great i didnt know what was going from human side but the monsters storyline was great kongs story was great i really felt this was his movie godzilla would pop up every other scene i could see a monster verse movie without human element the cgi was amazing monster fights were awesome dont have high expectations on storyline than its not for you if want to see monsters fight and battle this is it
Mar 29 2024,positive,do not listen to the critics theyre comparing this to minus one which was an epic drama beautiful but in its own way completely different this is an exciting and fun monster bash that borders on comedy and its supposed to this movie isnt meant to make you cry or reflect on life its meant to make you jump out of your chair at the fight scenes have some fun this movie was an absolute blast go see it in imax
Mar 29 2024,positive,excellent very interesting movie specially the rio de janeiro scene
Mar 29 2024,positive,it uses the best parts of the previous movies to make a popcorn fest with some heart
Mar 29 2024,positive,its was good kinda expected more from scar king but it was alright
Mar 29 2024,positive,if you like monsters fighting with great looking scenes and just over great action this movie is an 8710 my only gripe is that they continue to give an unnecessary time to the human characters which i get but i just really want to see monster duke it out the movie is still a really fun watch tho
Mar 29 2024,positive,i had a lot of fun watching this movie cgi was great human characters ok kajius emotions were brilliantly portrayed fights were awesome
Mar 29 2024,positive,its not like a perfect super hero movie and not something very unique story but the mixture of fantasy scenes  electro pop music  cultural village  atmospheric background  and funny and hearty moments feeling of touch based on the characters conversation  makes the movie quite  wholesome i enjoy the sound music and visual  effects  it is great combination
Mar 29 2024,positive,most fun the monsterverse has been all the monster scenes are fantastic and while the human dialogues could have been better this is one of the better set of characters and subplots when it comes to humans in the monsterverse
Mar 29 2024,positive,amazing action and some good emotional scenes overall a great and fun watch

Mar 29 2024,positive,i cant wait to see this movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,good movie great even but to be honest dont let reviewers that dont enjoy a fantasy world about monsters make your decision you go watch the movie and you review it yourself i went with friends that dont know much about godzilla and he gave it a 1010 so just go to enjoy it and not over analyst everything
Mar 29 2024,positive,entertaining great addition to the monsterverse
Mar 29 2024,negative,too low quality about story cgi is pretty great tho i dont worth it 410
Mar 29 2024,positive,i absolutely loved this movie its a 10 from me just remember its a monster movie its not the most plot driven movie it has absolutely fantastic moments this is a movie you should just try and enjoy dont worry about the plot like you would a thriller its not that important
Mar 29 2024,positive,good ol movie and fantastic cgi
Mar 29 2024,positive,incredible movie an absolute thrill the entire time
Mar 29 2024,positive,amazing movie do not listen to critics go watch the movie then you can decide for your own if it is good or not i saw it in imax what an experience definitely ill watch again
Mar 29 2024,positive,incredible basically kong home alone slash kong god of war would see it again immediately
Mar 29 2024,positive,godzilla x kong was virtually everything i wanted it to be the monsters especially kong had distinct personalities attitudes and goals some simpler than others action and visual communication carried the story along with an improved human cast that carries over the better qualities of godzilla v kong it is a huge departure from godzilla 2014s grounded qualities but the movie is unapologetic to turning it up to 11 that said great fun great humor visual and spoken great fights and incredible designs for the monsters and hollow earth long live monsterverse
Mar 29 2024,positive,critics can say what they want at least a large part of the audience is happy to spend money to go see it
Mar 29 2024,positive,its what you expect out of a kaiju blockbuster crazy silly awesome kaiju fights with a silly human side plot focuses more on kong making him the main character
Mar 29 2024,positive,an absolute blast from start to finish
Mar 29 2024,positive,the best product so far of the franchise arrives delivering what has been requested for a long time interaction only between titans without a doubt the best of this universe up to the moment
Mar 29 2024,positive,it was so awesome and made my day since i watch from 1954 to this year
Mar 29 2024,positive,dont know why the hate dont compare it to minus one because this is the opposite side of the same coin the kaiju actors humor action is all pretty good and ill see it again hope theres another one but maybe focused more on godzilla in this movies style go watch it
Mar 29 2024,positive,if you at any point in your life have ever picked up two kaiju figures and smashed them against each other while making up stories this is the film for you
Mar 29 2024,positive,2nd time watching it awesomeeeeee
Mar 29 2024,negative,all ugly style and no substance which judging by the audience score is more than adequate its like mtv minus the music on steroids meets transformers with the dizzying editing on acid which could actually be fun if it wasnt so soulless and despite the cgi spectacle so mindnumbingly tedious switching your brain off in order to enjoy it may not be enough and nothing short of godzilla frying the damn thing will suffice 92  mothra wept
Mar 29 2024,positive,balls to the wall giant monster fighting fun just enough camp to be silly like the showa era of godzilla films but not overly done where things felt too ridiculous fun entertaining as hell movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,it was filled with fighting so worth it 
Mar 29 2024,positive,movie was fantastic very entertaining movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,some of the most fun monster action ever put on screen this movie knows exactly what it is and leans into it in the best way just shut your brain off and enjoy long live the kings

Mar 29 2024,positive,the movie is very good and perfect
Mar 29 2024,positive,good movie but its fastpaced and skar king mostly relies on shimo
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie was made not only for the monsterverse fans but also for the fans of the kaiju genre its almost 2 hours full of great battles and awesome visual effects see it enjoy it explore the lore of the monsterverse and watch it again
Mar 29 2024,positive,awsome film so many titans were in the movie as well

Mar 29 2024,positive,it is such a great movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,it was so much fun and i cant wait to see it again
Mar 29 2024,positive,acting was okay comedy was weak but its not a drama or comedy movie its a monster action movie and it pulled that off well felt a little choppy but the action was superb overall its a very good movie well done hope to see more
Mar 29 2024,positive,real3d version   i enjoyed the movie more than i thought i would script is weak and the cgi is meh but thats not really why we go to see these kinds of movies is it   with regards to kong godzilla and other titans involved i thought it was enough of a reason to go and see this film there was also a bit of nostalgia for folks whove been watching godzilla for decades   its a must see in the theater if not i dont know if it will be worth watching
Mar 29 2024,positive,godzilla x kong the new empire is a fun ride hollow earth looked awesome and godzilla  new form is dope as fuck kong thunder glove is dope and i cant wait for more of trilogy and i think some people dont know how to have fun anymore and loved the bond that suko and kong grew out the movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,fun movie start to finish while different to godzilla minus one godzilla x kong lives up to the hype i will rewatch again and again
Mar 29 2024,positive,its good but kind of annoys me that they have to make godzilla stronger is some sort of way to beat his enemies every single movie kind of shows you how bias the director is for one character while the movie is focused on two characters
Mar 29 2024,positive,literally zero complaints and if i had to i guess the fights could have been longer but omg it was so freaking fun i cant wait to go back a million more times go see this movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,ok this movie is pretty good but dont they is getting too much its gonna have to be fantasy or an epic movie right just do not get so far i just want to to see the best ever like they did love it because of godzilla minus one and godzilla vs destroyha
Mar 29 2024,positive,less talking more action is exactly what they delivered
Mar 29 2024,positive,ts was beyond turnt mannnn everything was right just next time like godzilla kill da monster at the end
Mar 29 2024,positive,first off this movie is a really good time dont listen to what critics say when it comes to these movies the movie is beautiful the soundtrack is amazing and as always the kaiju battles are top tier if you love the other monsterverse films you will love this one definitely recommend this movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,amazing  i love  all the fights and monster  in some point i feel that the talk was too much story and i was losing it but overall the movie is a 1010 
Mar 29 2024,negative,the movies acting is bad the character development was really mediocre on the human side this is the worst film with godzilla godzilla is a side character the part were kong gets an inifinity gaunlet was so bad it was such a plot hole like how convenient they had that infinity gaunlet close to him it was ridicolous  there was no emotional connection with the viewer except for kong honestly this movie shouldnt had any human characters at all and just kong on the jungle if they had decided to go that route it would have been a better movie  since kong was the best part of it  but it wasnt enough to save this film
Mar 29 2024,positive,absolutely everything that i wanted from this film thank you for making me inner child happy again
Mar 29 2024,positive,much better than what i was looking for in a movie of my favorite monsters my theatre applauded and was impressed  in the epic moments just what i wanted to feel with people with the same tastes for destruction
Mar 29 2024,positive,what most critics dont understand is that their opinion doesnt even matter like at all it doesnt effect the money the movie gets nor does it effect the viewers if you listen to these opinions and let them steer how you feel about a film then you never will appreciate the film its just like a dumb dull human cast in an old monster movie they just talk to keep you there and thats really it   this movie was a great homage to the showa era of godzilla films and a great piece to enhance the lore of the monsterverse
Mar 29 2024,positive,they finally made the monster brawl movie the way they always should have been made im not going to the theater to watch this movie for oscar worthy performances an intricate story and something that speaks to the human experience i am watching this movie because its fun and should be visually captivating this one does not fall into the trap where it focuses on a human plight that no one cares about instead it gets straight to the action and lets the visual effects do the bulk of the story telling i found this film to be incredibly refreshing and a whole bunch of fun if you want to see monsters duke it out in stunning visuals this is the right film i sincerely hope they continue to make more films like this one less people more awesome monsters
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie was amazing 1010 must recommend frfr
Mar 29 2024,positive,fighting is exciting  not many human roles very good
Mar 29 2024,positive,super fun throwback to the old japanese films must see in theatres
Mar 29 2024,negative,absolutely horrendous the characters are extremely unlikeable childish humor and predictable story the editing was so rushed and there were several instances where the dialogue did not match with the offscreen actors mouth movements i went for the visuals and was still so disappointed literally felt like i was watching a blurry video game done with this franchise
Mar 29 2024,positive,solid movie wasnt watching the time or fidgeting to leave the entire movie thats saying a ton for someone with adhd my 6 year old went with me and absolutely loved the movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,i have been a godzilla fan since i was kid in the 90s  from the showa era helsi era 2000s era and the monsterverse   kong fan as well   some people may not understand these legendary monsters but this movie gave me showa era vibes i would watch this again  again   even tho this is a kongs story but godzilla to fight together  the colliding together in this action monster film i had amazing time     it may not be great as godzilla minus one which that got everyone excited  won a oscar award     but godzillakong has its own story  everyone needs to understand that     if this movie isnt for you then dont watch it   but if you want action film thats gonna get hype eat good popcorn and enjoy a great time   this movie is for you     godzillaxkong the new empire   9510   i would watch it again 
Mar 29 2024,positive,great movie good characters human and amazing kaiju action and fights very enjoyable to fans and casual viewers
Mar 29 2024,positive,it reminded me of the old toho movies with godzilla doing cool ish and running other monsters fades and who could forget kong standing on bidness
Mar 29 2024,positive,very enjoyable wish there were a secret bad guy since both baddies were leaked early but still a great flick after all
Mar 29 2024,positive,so epic every monsterverse movie surpasses the previous one with this i say it all i enjoyed the movie like a child and i wanted to see more definitely im ready to see it again
Mar 29 2024,neutral,the movie has an interesting background story but the narrative style is boring the motion of monster is weird and the story is also boring not to mention its unattractive way to introduce comedy
Mar 29 2024,positive,the humans and human plot overall are underwhelming except for trapper he is the mvp of this film but its compensated with the kaiju which feel like the true stars of the movie kongs arc is amazing godzilla might was good but i wish they went more indepth with his plot skar king although feeling underwhelming as well is such an ruthless villain i wished they gave him more screentime shimo is such a badass and suko was a pleasant surprise for me as i thought he would be a pain to watch during the film and the secret kaiju was a nice addition too    the visuals are topnotch the score was nice but nothing special and although some people will not find this film of their taste they have to at least give credit where credit is due to the heart and soul that went into the production of this movie which most recent blockbusters have lacked in this past few years
Mar 29 2024,positive,of all the monsterverse movies this is the most entertaining  it was made to entertain and it fulfills its objective 100  love this movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,everything you would love in a godzilla and kong movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,if you grew up watching godzilla movies from the 70s like i did then youll appreciate this movie growing up we had limited access to entertainment due to budget restrictions i remember my dad getting me godzilla vs megalon dvd for five bucks man i would rewatch the team battle fight of godzilla scenes over and over this movie godzilla x kong  takes me back to my childhood it reminds me of a happy  joyful time if youre wanting to enjoy a fun and action packed movie this is it spectacular special effects i couldnt get enough of godzilla long live the king
Mar 29 2024,positive,1010 i really enjoyed it loved it soooo much
Mar 29 2024,positive,it was great i would say that definitely its one of the best movies that i ever watch this year 
Mar 29 2024,positive,absolutely perfect the fight scenes are the best the humans arent bad goddamn its definitely gonna win an oscar probably
Mar 29 2024,positive,loved the action and the story long live the titans
Mar 29 2024,positive,one of the best in the series
Mar 29 2024,positive,a bit silly about the plot and human sequence but the monster part its the best part because its monster movie action packed epic and fantastic wish more godzilla spotlight but thats fine
Mar 29 2024,positive,best godzilla vs kong movie in my book  awesome visuals and more monster fights  the theatre was packed with cheering and awe for the jaw dropping action
Mar 29 2024,positive,outstanding and goofy kaiju fun amazing fight set pieces and enjoyable human cast one to see at the cinema if you can
Mar 29 2024,positive,this is not godzilla minus one that movie was an arthouse flick that focused on humanity gxk new empire is all about the kaiju especially bombastic kaiju battles honoring the godzilla movies of the 1970s the movie trailers perfectly represented the actual movie  it was a giant monster slugfest i enjoyed all the rampage and mayhem see it on an imax screen if you can like i did
Mar 29 2024,positive,the story was better than godzilla vs kong quite a few awesome fights scenes and finally fleshing out monster lore
Mar 29 2024,positive,great movie best monster verse movie by far so much fun you will have an amazing time with this movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,fun action packed movie  what a monster movie should be
Mar 29 2024,positive,godzilla x kong is a very fun and entertaining film i loved the action the fighting the suspense and the thrills i also love how it ended positively
Mar 29 2024,positive,the movie was stunning in how they portrayed the kijus and on how they bring back old kijus though i wont spoil
Mar 29 2024,positive,there were probably more fight scenes in this movie than the rest of the monsterverse movies combined awesome movie my only complaint is it could have been longer
Mar 29 2024,positive,415 the story is compelling the special effects are again unreal in this franchise the acting is strong and the scenery is gorgeous it also has a great tone usage of camera was strong as well  more than one incident comes to mind
Mar 29 2024,positive,a very fun roller coaster of a film the action and cgi were incredible the human story wasnt totally boring and actually fun plenty of monsters and fights the villain was a bit underused but still threatening overall a flawed film but its too fun to take seriously and thats a good thing
Mar 29 2024,positive,i came to see a big monster movie and i got that and so much more the monsterverse once again shows how to make a fun action packed thriller of a movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,i absolutely loved this movie its so much fun ill take giant monsters fighting anytime i also really enjoyed the addition of dan stevens character
Mar 29 2024,positive,this is godzilla x kong the new empire
Mar 29 2024,positive,if your coming into this movie with the same mindset as godzilla minus one you will be disappointed this is not a commentary abt war or anything like that its meant to be familiar of the classic godzilla showa era where monsters fight humans help in some way  sometimes things dont make sense but everyones there to have a good time obv there will be issues to the plot if you look into it but thats where your problem is ur looking into it rather than enjoying it have fun great movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,i had a blast watching this the beauty of the diverse ecosystem of hollow earth made me awestruck the action was phenomenal as well its ridiculous and i love that
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie was great for action but not really for the pacing i feel like they tried to rush the fights with godzilla vs scilla and tiamat they really focused on kong in the movie but besides that the fighting was great love the movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,it was a titans fan fest of an action movie all fun action from beginning to the end if youre a fan of kong godzilla and giant monster movies this is the one 
Mar 29 2024,positive,pure godzilla destroy all monsters vibe its a monster movie and one of the best fun funny and actionpacked
Mar 29 2024,positive,just saw godzilla kong the new empire and i thoroughly enjoyed myself its a fun action packed movie and the pacing was really good do not let the art snobb critics stop you from seeing it hopefully these ratings arent a comparison to minus one which was great but a different type of movie and thats ok go see it
Mar 29 2024,positive,an excellent movie with great fight scenes
Mar 29 2024,negative,as a hardcore fan of godzilla especially the mv this is genuinely the worst film ive ever seen     on top of disrespecting the lineage of the mv again in this film theres hardly a plot the characters have no actual character to them its way too quickly paced its cheesy bland boring and it looks horrendous most of the time practical effects are really all that looks good     i wish i never saw this and i recommend others dont
Mar 29 2024,positive,it was a fantastic movie   i dont care what the criticism said about this movie but it was an amazing experience for me great fights and thats it for me 1010
Mar 29 2024,positive,1010 i had so much fun watching this movie less human and more monster action sequence which is what i exactly wanted they made kong justice finally   in monsterverse
Mar 29 2024,positive,obviously this isnt minus one and thats okay i personally loved the movie im paying to see monsters fight and they did fight a lot and the cgi and the fights were amazing dont listen to the critics and regardless if you loved minus one you should go support this movie because without 2014 godzilla reviving the interest there wouldnt be a minus one i will say this if they make a final movie i hope godzilla gets more screen time and focus this and the last movie felt more like a kong movie with bits of godzilla than an equal movie of the two still love it
Mar 29 2024,positive,180 degrees tone wise from minus one  gxk is a big budget marvelesque action movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,adam succeeded in doing exactly what he sought out to do he delivered a showa era godzilla film for modern audiences i rate the movie 10 godzillas sliding on his tail out of 10
Mar 29 2024,positive,very fun film fun seeing godzilla and kong fight scenes on the big screen
Mar 29 2024,positive,the movie was predictable and the pace was quite slow for us audience who just wants to see the battle royale between the mighty titans the main event was awesomely choreographed and the titans were showing their fighting styles and power sets with total devastation  over all the plot was forgettable but the fight scenes was marvelous and dcent
Mar 29 2024,positive,absolute masterpiece hope the monsterverse continues on
Mar 29 2024,positive,i agree with everyone the fight scenes were amazing but that seriously doesnt make up for the lacklustre plot we follow the story of supposedly godzilla and kong but we all know the main character throughout the film was kong godzilla was just there for what felt like 20 second fight scenes that had no impact except him turning pink overall this movie just felt like one big wwe wrestling match with no sentimental value
Mar 29 2024,positive,pure fun from the beginning to end   watch it on the biggest screen possible
Mar 29 2024,positive,exactly what i was looking forward to stunning visuals incredible fights definitely made for fans if youre a kaiju fan this is a must see
Mar 29 2024,positive,it was totally different than the first one i was expecting it to be a recap on the first one but it was so much better i cant wait to watch it again it was an awesome movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,stop comparing this to godzilla minus one these are both very very amazing films the major difference is that this is a monsterverse film minus one is a toho godzilla film if you went into the theater expecting an oscar worthy film i suggest u leave this was a ten out of ten film for who it was made for adam wingard you are amazing and shove a fat one up ur ass rotten tomatoes 
Mar 29 2024,positive,a wonderful homage to the showa era films of godzilla embracing the fun and cheesiness of the classics that kept the franchise alive over the years
Mar 29 2024,positive,it was fun not as fun godzilla vs kong but enjoyable nonetheless i thought in this one the fights were a bit short the movie could have been trimmed in a few places missing past characters get no explanation seemed odd kong was badass godzilla is freaking awesome the other monsters get their piece overall a fun monster movie with a little extra fat
Mar 29 2024,positive,the action scenes are really good but the human stuff is a drag to get through with some comedy added in however i doubt most people saw the trailer for this movie and thought the human storyline was going to be amazing so id recommend if you saw the trailer and thought youd like it
Mar 29 2024,positive,the movie does what it promises a lot of monsters fights and fun
Mar 29 2024,positive,the trailer for this film did not do the movie justice this was way better then expected
Mar 29 2024,negative,although visually stunning there is no story nor characters to keep the viewer engaged all the problems and solutions materialize out of thin air and require constant rushed and elaborate explanations to navigate
Mar 29 2024,positive,really fun to watch if you like monsters fighting a wide variety of monsters then this is the best you got
Mar 29 2024,positive,its really dumb but so much fun
Mar 29 2024,positive,i was ready to watch the movie again halfway through it it was very well put together great storyline
Mar 29 2024,positive,movie delivered everything is monster verse fans could ever ask for this movie is visually so satisfying and if youre a godzilla fan prepare to feel amazing leaving the theater
Mar 29 2024,positive,very action packed  entertaining  and awesome although it is sort of fast paced but overall enjoyable
Mar 29 2024,negative,worst godzilla film i have ever seen and i have seen them all  every us godzilla film has gotten progressively worse and this one takes the cake  the irony is it followed godzilla minus one from toho which may have been the best godzilla film since the original 54 film  two hours of cg no plot and they now have godzilla running as fast as usain bolt    any true godzilla fan will want to see this regardless of reviews like mine but be prepared  it is an insult to the big guy
Mar 29 2024,positive,fun and pretty much a lot of action while the human writing i would say is decent especially they dont appear much compare to other monster movie but here kong definitely the main protagonist while godzilla being his companies fighting again stronger kaiju like shimu
Mar 29 2024,positive,truly a step up from gvk   voice acting 5 out of 5  following plot points 4 out of 5  human story 5 out of 5  titan story 5 out of 5  sequel factor 4 out of 5  overall 92  truly peak fiction
Mar 29 2024,positive,such a fun kick ass film def worth the wait team long all the way
Mar 29 2024,positive,its an incredible movie i really liked the effects it has
Mar 29 2024,positive,godzilla x kong new empire was a basic movieto add to the godzilla franchise although i could recommend it to be a bit longer let alone more fight scenes at the end i was really happy to see mothra again and gojira and kong working together as i said there were some scenes that needed more explaining for example more background scenes with scar and shimo but again the movie was still amazing highly recommended cant wait for what happenens next especially with kong having found his species and a new friend and mothra being in the hallow earth
Mar 29 2024,positive,perfectly ridiculous monster madness what you want from a godzilla kong movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,absolutely loved this movie great characters not perfect but the humans never are the main focus anyways they did what they were supposed to if you grew up with godzilla and kong movies especially showa era you will love every minute of this lots of callbacks and easter eggs to older films as well leaves the door open for more movies to come
Mar 29 2024,positive,the scenes between humans and monsters are balanced and satisfying audiovisual effects can be obtained during the monster battles
Mar 29 2024,positive,best monsterverse movie of all time highest grossing monsterverse movie is coming
Mar 29 2024,positive,great movie lots of action love it
Mar 29 2024,positive,i thought it was awesome very entertaining
Mar 29 2024,positive,great continuation with the two titans and good build up both titans actually got good amount of screentime and the humans are better in this movie than the last one only complaint was the final fight shouldve been longer but it was to epic to complain
Mar 29 2024,positive,this is a must see on the big screen
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie was so awesome monster fighting almost every scene this is definitely a movie worth watching if you like big monsters fighting
Mar 29 2024,positive,critics are being ridiculous comparing this movie to godzilla minus one gxk is a must see masterpiece on its own
Mar 29 2024,positive,it reminded me of the showa godzilla series 
Mar 29 2024,positive,the battle is epic many amazing things cool there are some funny moments the mini kong is cute and adorable the storyline is quite good the duration of the appearance of the monsters is quite good the view from the hollow earth is quite beautiful and crazy and the monster character design is even cooler
Mar 29 2024,positive,super fun and very fast paced human scenes were enjoyable and they didnt overstay their welcome great emotion and story from kongs pov 80s action duo mixed with the showa era of godzilla films
Mar 29 2024,positive,the action packed scenes in this movie are just perfection kong has the best story as a kaiju and godzilla is a iconic kaiju absolute best monsterverse movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,one of the most entertaining movies of the year and an absolute must see for fans of monster movies and action movies
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie had me saying hell ya many times
Mar 29 2024,positive,way better than i expected it be dont listen to the critics its a movie for all
Mar 29 2024,positive,visually a joyride 
Mar 29 2024,positive,good mindless fun crazy action to go along a crazy premise but overall pretty entertaining
Mar 29 2024,positive,i liked this movie because it had a lot of action and the actors were great plus their was more monster scenes then human scenes
Mar 29 2024,positive,1010  my brothers and i had a great fun time
Mar 29 2024,positive,this was just a non stop action movie i loves it a lot i think it respects both the monsters and shows them doing what they do best
Mar 29 2024,positive,goofiest modern godzilla movie yet there are some scenes so silly that it makes this worth the watch such a fun time its a rushed catastrophic mess but its fun and as a godzilla fan this satisfies my cravings
Mar 29 2024,positive,i enjoyed watching a monster movie that is actually about monsters centers the plot around the titans and is based on the evolution of godzilla and kong there are a lot of fights and thats very good
Mar 29 2024,positive,delivered in leaps and bounds the action fans have begged for since 2014
Mar 29 2024,positive,its a fun movie not every film has to be dissected down to a molecular level its a monster mash up with little human interaction and thats okay we love godzilla and i hope they keep the monsterverse going
Mar 29 2024,positive,mind numbing bone breaking action all the way through walk with your insurance card you might need it 
Mar 29 2024,positive,if you are looking for near nonstop kaiju action this is the movie for you my only major gripes with the film is that with how fast paced it is it feels a bit short another 30 or so minutes on the runtime to give godzilla a better presence in the film more time for the final battle so that it isnt only 8 minutes a proper scene of godzilla and kong begrudgingly teaming up or even just coexisting before the final battle and as well time to better flesh out our villains    the main villain skar king is shown to be very intelligent and plain evil very well though the second titan leaves some to be desired due to neither being on screen for very long or doing much else than bully kong then final fight they dont entirely feel like a true threat especially to godzilla who is repeatedly shown to easily take down his opponents even before his power up towards the end
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie brings back great actors from the previous movie kong has heart and godzilla rocks as usual there is a new little fella on the scene that wants to steal the show the movie flowed well with its storyline and special effects there were a couple of surprises i wasnt expecting my son is a huge godzilla fan and he enjoyed the kaijus the most from this movie you should see it in imax if possible

Mar 29 2024,positive,absolutely amazingi love how they do more kaiju scenes than human
Mar 29 2024,positive,amazing and fun movie as i always say audience score is the most important rating of a movie i totally recommend you this movie if you like giant monster movies or if you only want to see them in action one point i did not like is the same problem i have with godzilla vs kong is that kong has more protagonism than godzilla
Mar 29 2024,positive,one of the best of the monsterverse the fights are epic the human subplot is not boring like in boring movies it provides information without being annoying godzilla demonstrating why he is the alpha titan without a doubt kong is the soul of the movie 
Mar 29 2024,positive,its wwe of monster verse thats fcrazy and i loved it
Mar 29 2024,positive,what a great movie such a fun kinda short clashing era and showa era wwe battle monsterverse battle i loved this movie it was a silly dumb and i liked that  would recommend
Mar 29 2024,positive,i think the movie is great it has a lot a adventures and blockbuster the cgi was awesome and kaylee hottle as jia in the sequel was great i cant wait to see the next monsterverse movie and adam wingard is a great director the movie 100000010

Mar 29 2024,positive,i thought it was a fantastic monster verse movie super satisfying really when it comes to introducing the new characters and following the storyline of hollow earth origins and conflicts i thought they did an amazing job with this one 1010 for me fights were crazy 
Mar 29 2024,positive,so far as some say is a fun movie really epic good visuals and interesting story but they neglected again godzilla and use it just as an tool instead of a character this movies are kong histories and that is great i really hope this movies keep coming but with a bit more of equilibrium if they want to keep doing crossovers
Mar 29 2024,positive,great moviego see it
Mar 29 2024,positive,what a blast go see it in imax intense kaiju battles throughout this is what movies are all about so much fun 
Mar 29 2024,positive,my review of godzillaxkongthenewempire    a surprisingly engaging loreexpanding actionpacked blockbuster that gives the titan and ape plus more creatures the majority of screentime while having human standouts like gia and bernie    worth seeing in imax    910
Mar 29 2024,positive,by far the best movie in the monsterverse a monster movie done right from skar king shimo godzilla and kong all were written and presented well the titan battles were really really good i wish 2 of the battles were a little bit longer but good nonetheless adam wingrad introduce alot of new titans which was needed in this cinematic universe monster action monster action oh and godzilla is a bada
Mar 29 2024,positive,cool and magnificent and cooling awesome and tubular

Mar 29 2024,positive,overall i loved it i liked it more than godzilla vs kong only thing that would have made it better is if it had bear mccrearys score from godzilla king of the monsters
Mar 29 2024,positive,my review of godzillaxkongthenewempire    a surprisingly engaging loreexpanding actionpacked blockbuster that gives the titan and ape plus more creatures the majority of screentime while having human standouts like gia and bernie    worth seeing in imax    910
Mar 29 2024,positive,it was a total slug fest giant monsters attacking cities each other what more could you ask for all the titans look great adam you outdid yourself   i give it 5 skyscrapers
Mar 29 2024,positive,absolute awesome kaiju action humans are nonsensical but thats expected you get what you get big monsters fighting what else could you want maybe more godzilla though
Mar 29 2024,positive,the first hour is straight up solving mysteries with a lack of balance between comedy and suspense but the movie is saved during the rising action loved how we got less screen time with the human characters cause the movie wouldve been less entertaining the creativity they used for the godzilla and kong fight scenes is the main highlight and the chilling score mixed together is chefs kiss
Mar 29 2024,positive,the film was very enjoyable lot of action and comedy overall im glad to see godzilla and kong back on the big screen cant wait to see whats next now
Mar 29 2024,positive,my review of godzillaxkongthenewempire    a surprisingly engaging loreexpanding actionpacked blockbuster that gives the titan and ape plus more creatures the majority of screentime while having human standouts like gia and bernie    worth seeing in imax    910
Mar 29 2024,positive,when you go watch this type of movie this  is even more of what you expect yeah its insane but cmon how can you continue making entertaining monster movies you just go bonkers with the fights
Mar 29 2024,positive,critics dont realize that this isnt supposed to be like godzilla minus one this is a fun thrilling movie with yes great acting cgi in some parts was pretty awful but when the movie progressed it got better felt kinda rushed at the end
Mar 29 2024,positive,excellent movie good story great action and vfx must see for any godzilla or kong fan
Mar 29 2024,negative,it was so underwhelming and i didnt really feel anything adam wingard continues to prove that he should not be the one directing these movies while a stepup from godzilla vs kong it suffers from too many monster scenes that leave the final fight something to be desired theres plenty of better kaijū and giant monster movies to watch that arent this one
Mar 29 2024,positive,great continuous to the kong godzilla storyline brought back members of the cast from the last movie great movie at the imax in 3d
Mar 29 2024,positive,wow this is what a great movie looks like
Mar 29 2024,positive,oh man it was so freaking good i really enjoyed it took the entire family just a fun kaiju adventure
Mar 29 2024,positive,my family and i completely enjoyed this movie  it was basically a movie about kong with a cool godzilla subplot  kong came across as vulnerable but not made to appear weak and evoked a lot of emotion with his storyline  godzilla straight up came across as a powerhouse  the humans in this storyline were not overly annoying    if youve seen godzilla minus one and are expecting more of that type of movie you will be disappointed  godzilla minus one was a great movie but was going for a different vibe  it was a new godzilla where less of the monster was more  godzilla x kong features titans who have been developed over multiple movies  less is more does not work with them  the story centers on them most specifically kong and follows his trials and tribulations  this story has a lot of action with both kong and godzilla fighting other creatures    i suspend my belief when watching movies like this  its big creatures fighting other big creatures after all  only thing in the entire movie that had me rolling my eyes was how kong got his gauntlet  if something like that is the only thing i am complaining about then i am pretty happy
Mar 29 2024,positive,love it monster action was great i can tell the franchise is heading in the correct way the kids and wife loved it as well dont listen to the critics and see it for yourselves
Mar 29 2024,positive,had a lot of fun with this one
Mar 29 2024,positive,best american godzilla movie  first lets talk about those critics critics are insane dont compare this movie to minus one comparing them would be like complaining why mcu spiderman isnt more like tobey maguires spiderman as for the movie itself its amazing beautiful scenes from hollow earth kong has tons of screentime and you really connect with him the monster fighting is on point and there is plenty of it while this film comes off as goofy it has its moments our main villain skar king is told to be a deranged ape who is obsessed with returning to the surface we see his lair and its actually one the most violent scenes in any american godzilla movies apes heads on stakes ape chucked into lava river and everyone looks they have been abused tirelessly we also learn about the baby kong suko he is shown to be an abused ape who is starved and constantly hit by his rulers the actual fight that takes place down there keeps you on the edge of your seat the final battles really take the cake here while they are a bit more goofy they very good and fun it was briefly mentioned earlier but the movie is very pretty the cgi looks great and its overall very nice to look at and certain shots are just stunning make sure to watch in imax    conclusion fun  beautiful movie that has its dark moments dont compare to minus one
Mar 29 2024,positive,i really dont understand the critics this is exactly what it set out to be its a monsterverse movie and man is it a slam fest this is a non stop action fest no unnecessary major actors trying to add some human drama story its a titan movie youll love it your kids will love it your grandkids will be watching this in the future 2 hours went by quick and cant wait to go see it again in imax go see it
Mar 29 2024,positive,a little slow at the beginning but it is improving in pace good characters good cgi and good fight sequences highly recommended
Mar 29 2024,positive,one of the most jaw dropping and monster smashing movie that we could ever dream of they understand godzilla really wellunlike the critics who knows nothing about godzilla and wants to ruin everyone day critics has lost their way so go see godzilla x kong the new empire on theaters its totaly worth youre time
Mar 29 2024,positive,exactly what youre looking for in a movie like this awesome action could use a little less humans   definitely want to see it again
Mar 29 2024,positive,absolutely phenomenal movie fun is often used as a word to degrade a movie but this is actually fun and it has it in spades the human story is underdeveloped sure but i have no idea why theyre getting so much hate theres 4 human cast members 2 are the heart of the movie and 2 are the comedic relief and do a good job of it but the real reason to see this movie is the monsters they are an incredible spectacle and theyre onscreen a lot cant wait to see it again
Mar 29 2024,negative,this movie is so bad
Mar 29 2024,positive,great movie with many monsters scene action packed definitely will see again not perfect movie but fun
Mar 29 2024,positive,hell of a fun time not a minus one but why would it be see it in imax to take in the awesome action
Mar 29 2024,positive,i enjoyed the movie i love the baby kong helping out hope to see him in the next film it was also good to see the other apes and now kong can have company
Mar 29 2024,positive,loved the movie so so good
Mar 29 2024,positive,best of the monster verse i love the old school showa remake moments throughout the movie only complaint some of the fight scenes real very quick but overall amazing action packed ride
Mar 29 2024,positive,loved the overall movie the plot and acting was amazing now in my top ten of all time
Mar 29 2024,negative,i thought it was aggressively mediocre but the atrocious score by junkie xl made it even worse you could have completely removed godzilla and the entire plot would stay the same in fact i would bet on the script being salvaged from a shelved kong sequel    the visuals for kong look great but godzilla looks pretty rough especially compared to the previous entries and minus one the lighting is especially off mainly in the rome and rio scenes mothra feels like an afterthought her entire character contradicts kotm her knockoff theme sounds like its ai generated    as for the villains they both have very good designs though thats about it
Mar 29 2024,positive,dont have any plans this weekend then you gotta come watch this movie i give it 5 stars best movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,a must see movie in imax
Mar 29 2024,positive,godzilla is majestic and kong is soo brave motra is cute and glorious mini kong is cute and funny scar king and shimu are explosive and humans are human loved it all is fun and more fun
Mar 29 2024,positive,in my opinion gxk the new empire is a nice and funny movie it tried to show more of the monsterverse and the logic of this universe and thats was amazing we know that the history is simple and dont have much depth lore inside of it but all of us have already known that this movies lore isnt created to be a serious and deeply one so its ok its a gxk vibe but with more focus on new phase of the kongs life and new monsters the movie supply that promised so for me its a good monsterverse moviebut i will prefer king of the monsters forever
Mar 29 2024,positive,outstanding movie awesome new chapter in the series
Mar 29 2024,positive,i loved the movie the action was great and the emotion of the characters was also great i know some of the human stories have not been great but i feel like this story for them was one of their best werent on screen to much but connected with the characters i cant wait for the next installment
Mar 29 2024,positive,pure entertainment thru and thru i loved everything about the film and kong is the man 
Mar 29 2024,positive,more action fun epic battle
Mar 29 2024,positive,it was great full of action from beginning to end
Mar 29 2024,positive,great movie only thing that made me question it was that they just conveniently had the brace for kong there and it was a perfect fit the first time they tried it on him
Mar 29 2024,positive,keep up on your suspense the whole movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,enjoyable to the end
Mar 29 2024,positive,best fighting scenes ever i always love king kong wasnt a fan of godzilla until this movie best monster movie ever handsdown
Mar 29 2024,positive,some godzilla movies are taken seriously some godzilla movies are made for a wacky adventure sure its a mindless blockbuster with narrative issues but the emotion on the kaiju is art suko and kong are a perfect father and son the entertainment is full of action i really enjoy this movie so much truly a amazing showa like movie 
Mar 29 2024,positive,a lot of fun loved the nonstop action and the visuals look amazing
Mar 29 2024,positive,pretty good as far as monster action movies go has all the essentials flashy fight scenes sounds that are extra bassboosted and a hidden feelgood message within a mediocre plotline there were some genuinely funny momentsquips and the movie doesnt feel like it takes itself too seriously relatively fastpasted and interesting good for a turnyourbrainoff kinda night
Mar 29 2024,positive,well done reminiscent of the showa era in respect to monster action human characters will be just thathuman characters however that is not why we go to see godzillamonster movies for the most part remember it is fantasyscifi enjoy it and have fun escape from reality for an hour and 55 minutes
Mar 29 2024,positive,great monster beatdown film if you love the old goofy godzilla movies from the 60s and 70s where monsters do wrestling moves then you love this human characters were okay sometimes rolled my eyes when they showed up but when on screen they try to make you laugh with nerdy jokes either way its worth when the monsters come back on screen in conclusion a must watch for action lovers
Mar 29 2024,positive,the titans stole the show
Mar 29 2024,positive,ive always been a fab of godzilla since i was a little kid to the point i was in kindergarten and asking for the movies for christmas and getting my letter back from santa at school saying santa thinks making godzilla movies is hard for the elves to do as they dont have the technology to do so but my parents might get me one if i was good and wouldnt you know it i got some godzilla movies for christmas and i believe ill ask again for this movie for christmas i loved it
Mar 29 2024,positive,funny epic big battles and great visuals
Mar 29 2024,positive,honestly go see it in theatres its so good and ugh just go watch it  youll understand 
Mar 29 2024,positive,overall i think its a very good addition to the monsterverse the monsters have so much character especially kong part of me wishes it had a similar runtime to kotm i just feel its a bit too rushed but then again im rating this movie on its own and not comparing it to minus one
Mar 29 2024,positive,action packed from start to finish 
Mar 29 2024,positive,one of the best monsterverse movies this will make 1 billion lol im kidding itll probably make 450700 million
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie was the best we basically got everything that we wanted the fights were good and the dialogue for the humans was alright but mostly it
Mar 29 2024,positive,the movie is fun with lots of kaiju action and destruction that said adam wingard doesnt shoot his movie with much scale battles between apes without anything on screen to give a sense of size means they might as well be 5 feel tall monsters that weigh 100 tons move like they weigh 100 pounds all physics are also thrown out the window  in this regard its the worst in the series however if you go into it wanting a fun time and can turn your brain off then you will enjoy it for the kaiju mayhem and likable characters
Mar 29 2024,positive,the movie have all the scenes that we were waiting for just the best movie ive ever seen i really recomend it
Mar 29 2024,positive,its a story that feels short because of the short time but i enjoyed every fight and how the story was told from the titans im excited for what comes in the future
Mar 29 2024,positive,straight to the point smack down kaiju action we are here for monster action and thats what it delivers to the highest degree
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie is literally only describable as pure fun the monster battles are very intense and all feel different and diverse but still giving you a good rush of excitement every time the new villain skar king is an amazing character to witness smart tyrannical and disgustingly despicable he also has a very very sinister and cynical sense of humor he took the light almost every time he was on screen     kong as always is our titan reflector the anomaly in the movie that we can see ourselves in this movie like godzilla vs kong is definitely his movie as the protagonist and his egotistical partner in crime godzilla as his reluctant teammate the humans also surprisingly were enjoyable to watch which the monsterverse tends to struggle to do there are still things that are iffy about this film but what godzilla vs kong did poorly in godzilla x kong made up for very well    one thing that is brought up is the comparison between this film and the recent success and oscar winner godzilla minus one minus one was a beautiful movie that had so much in honor of the original 1954 film however something we shouldnt do is compare the two    these 2 films have 2 entirely different goals that are not comparable in any shape or form any critic or person expecting to get what godzilla minus one offered from godzilla x kong will be left disappointed but that is to their own fault    minus ones goal is to give you a complex message to have you thinking and learning godzilla x kongs goal is to entertain you and offer you nothing but amazing action and wacky fun the two are not comparable and never will be    but overall what this movie wants you to recieve is amazing and will definitely have you very entertained and i would 100 consider this rewatch material
Mar 29 2024,positive,it was truly a fun ride theres so much they can fill in still and it ends with so many amazing next movie opportunities that i cant wait to discuss this for years to come two kings two queens kong jr absolutely loved it
Mar 29 2024,positive,too long of a buildup to the action
Mar 29 2024,positive,this is a love letter to huge monster verse fans and fans of godzilla and kong throughout the decades i do believe this is the best monster verse film currently im sure that itself might sound like recently bias since this just released but as of rn it is the best although this film as some slight flaws this improves from what some of the issues godzilla vs kong had    doug also made a cameo and stole kongs food peak cinema 
Mar 29 2024,positive,i love this movie it was really more focused on kong or atleast he came out most of the movie but cant complain for much titan fighting awesome
Mar 29 2024,positive,theres ten different times i wanted to stand up and cheer a rousing success to me
Mar 29 2024,positive,loved it allfrom beginning to the end well written  made so if you enjoy the previous sequels youll truly love this thumbs way up on this one
Mar 29 2024,positive,epic and badass monster fight
Mar 29 2024,positive,obviously everyone wanted more kaiju battles and less human time which is exactly what this movie gave us monsters fighting monsters and it was just such a wild fun ride to watch
Mar 29 2024,positive,finally got a monster movie with mostly monster fight scenes instead of pointless human focused stories great movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,a must see blockbuster i had soo much fun the monsterverse never fails to make me feel like a kid again this has the perfect saturday morning cartoon feel i gave it 4 and a half stars only because it couldve used more godzilla hopefully the sequel praying fixes that
Mar 29 2024,positive,any monster movie nut that is looking for a hype movie both godzilla and king kong got me reconsidering my workout regiment
Mar 29 2024,positive,bloody brilliant monster fights a little slow on the human side but once the fights start my god do they get brutal
Mar 29 2024,negative,this movie delayed the brack fliday bundulu
Mar 29 2024,positive,a good ol fashioned monster mash
Mar 29 2024,positive,not bad but these movies are kinda dumb fun everyone reading this come to christ if you havent yet amen 
Mar 29 2024,positive,just enough story to tie together two hours of amazing kaiju fights godzilla minus one shown that there can be a great story behind the monsters actions but godzilla x kong leans in heavily to the fights that long time fans love
Mar 29 2024,positive,showa era vibes me 33 and my 6 year old both loved it
Mar 29 2024,positive,after watching minus one multiple times i was honestly not excited for this  after seeing it i can say it was enjoyable and the monster fights were awesome  with the 80s soundtrack i felt like it was old school wwf wrestlemania with monsters  the final battle was like a tag team match   didnt get a chance to see it in imax but im sure that would have added to the movie  minus one had a great storyline with the human characters and could have been a stand alone story about ptsd and survivor guilt  this one still suffers from the humans taking up valuable screen time
Mar 29 2024,positive,good action packed and lighthearted movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,got exactly what i was looking for and i didnt need anything else ive been a huge kaiju fan since i was young so this movie really delivered the goods for me a bunch of big dumb fun with tons of action but not much story to wrap your head around
Mar 29 2024,positive,fun action packed story it kept me guessing at times  the actors were refreshing the special effects were very realistic   it is a must see
Mar 29 2024,positive,excellent movie the whole fam loved it
Mar 29 2024,positive,monster smackdown epic if you are a kaiju fan
Mar 29 2024,positive,it was a ton of fun great cinematography matched by a great score and cgi the fights were fantastic but kong and mini kong steal the show fun mindless entertainment highly recommend
Mar 29 2024,negative,crazy to call a kong or godzilla movie sillybut im a fan of both and this was just a bad effort poor actingcrazy to follow story line and really only the last 40 minutes had watchable action unfortunatley by that time it was so hilariously complicated with the stupid storyline that i just wanted it all to end
Mar 29 2024,positive,loved every bit of it to hell with the critics
Mar 29 2024,positive,this was a silly but fun movie better than i expected
Mar 29 2024,positive,10 out 10 very interesting move and whats to come form the monster verse 
Mar 29 2024,positive,absolutely brilliant definitely going to see it again
Mar 29 2024,negative,there was not enough story and the fights were not even that long the move itself felt felt rush and incomplete
Mar 29 2024,positive,great movie the critics are snobs
Mar 29 2024,positive,my review of godzillaxkongthenewempire    a surprisingly engaging loreexpanding actionpacked blockbuster that gives the titan and ape plus more creatures the majority of screentime while having human standouts like gia and bernie    worth seeing in imax    910    5
Mar 29 2024,positive,theres scenes that will blow you away and theres new enemy and they make their debut so there great parts of the movie and i think its phenomenal to see it
Mar 29 2024,positive,the movie was entertaining from start to end i wish we could have had more godzilla but kong s character development was fun to watch the humans arc didnt disappoint either as this time they really contributed to build the story and explain what the giant titans couldnt the fights were mostly nonsensical yes but we are watching giant monsters fighting in the hollow earth and godzillas atomic breath   all in all it was such a great movie id watch it a thousand times
Mar 29 2024,neutral,story line was not the best everything felt rushed for little fight seen no suspense at all
Mar 29 2024,positive,this by far is one of the in the monster verse in the franchise they hidden every single easter eggs and detail that were from the comics and the previous movies and with most monsters seen on the big screen since godzilla king of the monsters 2019 this one will be good for familys and kids who were a fan of the lore and franchise itself
Mar 29 2024,positive,in fact the human characters they have quite poor and forgettable development but thats precisely what its about well tell me who could expect plots full of drama and deep characters in a movie named after two giant monsters
Mar 29 2024,negative,these monsterverse movies are steadily getting worse the story was basic the script was bad which led to some laughable acting and the fight scenes were over before they started this movie almost seemed as if there wasnt a script written and they made it up as they went along with the filming if i was toho i would try to take the rights of godzilla away from legendary
Mar 29 2024,positive,peak movie action was great i hate how critics are comparing it to minus one when they are completely different films so dont trust the critics
Mar 29 2024,positive,pretty good as a fan of the previous movies i thought this was a pretty good follow up i was not a fan of the monarch tv series however so i was very grateful to see a ton of monsters in this one definitely one for the monster fans a lot of time spent in hollow earth and getting to see lots of different creatures and monsters really made for an awesome experience
Mar 29 2024,positive,it was good and funny thank you
Mar 29 2024,positive,the movie is great and it is fun to watch and suitable for all ages but the cgi is not improving so much thus almost everything will be scrapped not to worry box office will tell you how great it is
Mar 29 2024,positive,a good critic will know that you can never rate the cooking of a cut of meat in the same way as the preparation of a salad the same thing happens with movies you have to know what you are seeing
Mar 29 2024,positive,the movie is just amazing and action packed lots of funny moments
Mar 29 2024,positive,the movie was a fun ride though not perfect the movie was very enjoyable from beginning to end im happy they just concentrated on 4 humans and not 10 plus for a change the animation was great and an amazing monster battle i cannot wait until monarch season to comes out to see how this will tie in
Mar 29 2024,positive,basically we wished for godzilla to revert back to his normal blue form but it didnt happen and i got upset at that because we want our godzilla to be back to his normal form again and the 2nd one is that kong never got his lighting powers and it never did happen which we all thought it did but sadly non of these 2 things didnt happen  adam wingard if u heard this message plz remind us if itll happen and if godzilla can go back to his normal form and kong getting his lighting powers please thank you but the good thing is that the film was incredibly successful and amazing
Mar 29 2024,positive,basically the transformers of the monster verse
Mar 29 2024,positive,this film surpassed my expectations although its not an oscar worthy film but the cinematography was done very well the balance between the titans and the human characters were done well the movie isnt without flaws such as the back store of the villains but overall a must watch in theaters
Mar 29 2024,positive,see it on the big screen for sure
Mar 29 2024,positive,we loved it and will be back for a round 2
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie is dum fun a good time to switch you brain off and enjoy what youre watching i cant recommend it enough to go see it is not perfect but everything with kong is amazing godzilla was great as well and the humans where not that bad i recommend watching it in imax overall a amazing fun movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,if you want to see monsters punching each other in the face like i was see this movie its really good in that aspect pacing feels rushed but is fun and would probably be a great rewatch
Mar 29 2024,positive,great action defined nod to the 70s movies and sets up a 3rd part nicely see it in imax if you can
Mar 29 2024,positive,dont pay attention to those critics if you can call them critics this movie meets what we are going to see giant monsters fighting
Mar 29 2024,positive,absolutely loved it kaiju action perfection
Mar 29 2024,positive,loved every moment godzilla scenes gave me chills
Mar 29 2024,positive,a visual spectacle awesome special effect decent story amd a blast to watch    human actors were horrible but two mega stars shined brighter than ever
Mar 29 2024,positive,it knows exactly what it is its an unapologetic shōwa film its as if this film was placed right in between ghidorah the three headed monster and invasion of astro monster with the 70s movies aesthetics i just wish there was some more space between the fights and build up the finale more otherwise its a great time and if youre a fan and want to see them make a modern day version of a film from the 60s70s then you will be happy to it put it short you get to see kong do kong stuff and godzilla doing godzilla stuff
Mar 29 2024,positive,peak monsterverse    must watch if you love monster action
Mar 29 2024,neutral,it was okay the prior movies were better the ending was the best part of the movie and thats not good movies should have awesome parts throughout a 2 hour movie
Mar 29 2024,negative,if youre going a movie involving a story youre in the wrong place its a cgi fight fest that helps pass the time but theres times thatll have you scrolling your phone passes as an okay action film with the headliner being godzilla
Mar 29 2024,positive,my 8 year old daughter and i caught an imax screening this evening and im happy to say that the new empire is a good time at the movies shes seen every godzilla movie and she had a blast throughout and im reasonably sure the kids will go crazy for the absurdity this films presents     kong is the lead and has a character arc that is easy to follow i loved the continued lore of the monsterverse and like any good story i was left wanting more     the human characters are solid but they are the side characters if you cant identify with kong as a character rather than just a cgi ape youll probably feel like theres little to chew on but in my subjective opinion this is a lot better than critics are giving it credit for godzilla minus one is a phenomenal film but i think its existence and proximity skewed some folks i think the general audience will like this more
Mar 29 2024,positive,great kaiju action godzilla was amazing
Mar 29 2024,positive,i was completely shocked how fun and thrilling this movie was so many easter eggs throughout the movie great action and this movie should make fans very happy a lot of kong this time which made sense my only mistake was not seeing this in the biggest imax screen possible  55
Mar 29 2024,positive,its a fun movie trust me when you watch it youll see its just ww3 for kaiju and its just a classic toho film showa fun and even tho shimo was a bit disappointing they really show godzillas title as king of the monsters
Mar 29 2024,positive,this is an amazing addition to the monsterverse loved everything about it
Mar 29 2024,positive,great movie definitely happy that we went to go see it
Mar 29 2024,negative,i know its supposed to be a monster movie but it doesnt even do that right half the movie is out of focus to which someone asked the theater if we were in a 3d movie by mistake  we were not  half the movie is monsters grunting at each other with zero subtitles and the other half is humans pointing out the obvious the main monster fight could have been on youtube they were so boring dont waste your time on this one folks
Mar 29 2024,positive,very interesting story seems like next part is coming soon
Mar 29 2024,positive,beautiful everything beautiful from the music to visuals and landscape the fights were amazing the scenes with alot of emotion had me crying i loved the action scenes and the funny moments with bernie trapper kong and suko some scenes were fast paced but i still enjoyed the movie im going to see this again tomorrow adam wingard and everyone did wonderful work on this money
Mar 29 2024,neutral,kidish and a bit corny cool visuals but over all dragged on enjoyable for kids 7 but i would say for adults its something that is okay story and context wise but if you are just into seeing just cool visual effects and kong and godzilla kicking butt youll enjoy it
Mar 29 2024,positive,a bit silly in times the humans pretty much just seem to get in the way if you cant develop the characters properly then just leave them out completely   i would have to say that this would rate second best of the mv movies behind 2014 i say that because this movie lets the g man loose to be himself  hes a kick a monster that protects the earth viciously  he cares not for other monsters including kong he just rips them apart once again kong is saved from la godzilla death  overall a fun movie less the boring human parts
Mar 29 2024,positive,my favorite of the monsterverse movies so far all the human characters are great every time kong godzilla and the other monsters are onscreen its badass lots of enjoyable humor loved the imax visuals
Mar 29 2024,neutral,sadly this has to come after minus one if not in itself it would have been quite entertaining i do not like the new choice of color for godzilla it brings no added benefit that is memorable kongs power gauntlet is just too convenient to be ready for him makes little sense and mothra makes a surprise appearance or is that a mosquito with butterfly wings overall the movie is entertaining but easily forgettable not as good as the previous installment and pales in comparison to the first
Mar 29 2024,positive,the parts with the humans got a bit unnecessary and extra but it was more than made up for by the amazing wonderful spectacular endless monsters story telling and  grandiose fighting we came here to see
Mar 29 2024,positive,delightful fun and very approachable for kids
Mar 29 2024,positive,watched it at imax  an absolute thrill ride  action some horror jump scares mayhem destruction and a great soundtrack  it seemed like a 2hour universal studios attraction  i got exactly what i hoped for from the two biggest movie stars  go see it
Mar 29 2024,positive,what an action packed and fun movie was so much fun watching
Mar 29 2024,positive,awesome addition to the monsterverse great visuals and enjoyed from start to finish
Mar 29 2024,positive,i really enjoy the movie but those seats got me stressed out bro i couldnt even eat my chicken tenders and fries in peace
Mar 29 2024,positive,best of the legendary movies   you can tell it was made by a fan of the toho series
Mar 29 2024,positive,this was made for godzilla fans from the 1970s its great for kids cause its just monsteronmonster action theres no plot so casual viewers are not going to like it if you like monster vs monster then youll probably like it
Mar 29 2024,positive,i think this movie was a fun monster brawl it was amazing
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie is fun i enjoyed every aspect of the film the kajiu fights scenes were amazing i like the cartoony vibe this movie offer but overall tia movie was great stop comparing it to minus one its two different worlds
Mar 29 2024,positive,this is a fun movie lots of kaijuonkaiju action lots of famous locations getting demolished and the human cast led by kaylee hottle is fantastic it is worth the money and more a must see especially for the family
Mar 29 2024,positive,good action and storyline
Mar 29 2024,positive,the movie was great amazing action sequences top notch cgi the human story was definitely better than it was in other previous entries of the monsterverse 910 definitely recommended
Mar 29 2024,positive,lots of action and increasingly campy dialogue
Mar 29 2024,positive,odd editing and pacing at the beginning of the movie story not its strongest part but the monster action was super fun and awesome just as expected
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie was amazing as fuck story line was great visuals  effects amazing music impeccable top 10 movies this year forsure
Mar 29 2024,positive,no filler the story moves right along a ton of action
Mar 29 2024,positive,honestly it was really good and wanna say a bit more physical then the previous films lol
Mar 29 2024,positive,the movie is just very awesome and fun very recommended
Mar 29 2024,positive,i thought that this was a pretty good movie it had good acting nice action packed fight scenes and even a little diddys kong in reality it was just a little kid gorilla but i like the nickname diddys kong just for the memes but i do have to complain about how misleading the title is for being a kong and godzilla based movie there wasnt really much of godzilla in the movie at all i mean he only had like 30 minutes of screen time in an hour and 50 minute long movie the movie focuses way to much around kong instead and it made godzillas sence feel more like a side story other than a main story but besides that the final battle scene was fabulous it was so incredible to see these for giants go head to head with pretty much the exact same opponents the hole scene was absolutely fantastic stunning and entertaining all at the exact same time and fo that i am giving this movie a 4 star review 
Mar 29 2024,positive,very entertaining the story was awesome as well as the action if your a godzilla or kong fan youll love this movie i did
Mar 29 2024,positive,big fun scene action action nonstop lets go but mediocre plotline
Mar 29 2024,positive,listen  the critics are right you are going to see a monster movie enjoy it yes its mostly kong and diddy kong on an adventure while godzilla acts like a cat but in the end they both realize their mothers names are both mothra and its a spectacle to behold also skar king is king excellent villain
Mar 29 2024,positive,this is fun filled with unique and exciting battle scenes the human roles are fun the characters are charming the movie may not be liked by critics because they didnt make it for critics to see but they made it so that viewers who love kong and godzilla like us will enjoy watching it
Mar 29 2024,positive,like most critics this movie gets a low rating due to having a paper thin plot and paper thin characters minus one shows a masterful telling of what a godzilla feature can be this film shows the other side monster fun and good moments throughout the film if youre looking for a good time a price for admission to see this movie is well deserved
Mar 29 2024,positive,i havent watched it yet but i have to see
Mar 29 2024,positive,great movie loved it a lot and the monster action 910
Mar 29 2024,positive,very amazing movie i recommended u guys to watch it
Mar 29 2024,neutral,even though i have given this a two and a half star review i still feel as if i left the movie theater satisfied due  to the fact that i went into the movie with the expectation of wanting to see the monsters and  a whole lot of monster fights  which in the sense of this movie it delivered and was a ton of fun watching it cgi kong and godzilla do what they do best  now as far as the human element of the movie trying to build a story around it with the monsters is where this movie lacks  for me bringing my rating down  if it wasnt for the lackluster performances and very dull moments of explanation even though these movies have been notorious for having to do so since the monsters cant talk  there were a few funny bright spots with a couple of one liners that hit the note well the rest of the human actors of this movie drag it down  if there was just more monsters in this movie to go around to eliminate the need to have to have the human element in it i would have given it more stars but i understand that this is a movie and there needs to be somewhat of a story to keep things going in the direction that will lead it to an eventual end without just having monster fights for an hour and 45 minutes     if you have time to spare and love to see monsters on screen with full destruction involved this is a movie for you as long as you go into it with the notion that you will be a little bit bored by the human element of this movie but dont really care if it ruins it or not for you in the end you are there for monster fights    i give this movie a c rating
Mar 29 2024,positive,loved the movie but perfer the first one
Mar 29 2024,positive,what a great movie lots of action the battles were really well done
Mar 29 2024,positive,it a great movie in 3d
Mar 29 2024,positive,godzilla x kong the new empire continues the monsterverse with an amazing buddy cop actionpacked film
Mar 29 2024,positive,come on guys seriously it s not that bad at least rate it higher ok and all seriousness i actually like this movie it reminded me of the showa era which i loved and i will admit the scenes where the kaiju are all by themselves were amazing
Mar 29 2024,positive,movie isnt the greatest but its been a while since i been in the theater so i enjoyed the experience of it all
Mar 29 2024,positive,great mindless fun  just go there get a big popcorn and drink and just turn your mind off  the movie is fun  my husband loved it as well
Mar 29 2024,positive,if you enjoy showa era godzilla youll love this
Mar 29 2024,positive,loved the monster action the human story was good at some points but sadly fell flat i loved the interactions with the other monsters as well
Mar 29 2024,positive,more of monarch big fights with no characters
Mar 29 2024,positive,ignore the critics rating this is not a movie for them this is a movie for somebody who enjoys a lot of effing great monster action i kept thinking this is guardians of the galaxy meets godzillaking kong so many great hell yeah moments in this movie the characters were all great and jelled together very well this movie also avoided the pitfall of trying to do too much heavy lore with all of that government agency stuff and some human villain that you dont care about that drags the lines down typically if you wanna have a great time smile a lot and cheer some great monster action go see this movie its my favorite of the new series
Mar 29 2024,positive,i thought it was intenseand nonstop action monster moviekong teams up with godzilla for ultimate take down of scarking visuals are beautiful
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie is such a wonderful movie cinematography is on point the action is insane and characters were great choices and showing how powerful godzilla really is was also insane just wish the final battle were longer and that godzilla got the final kill some shots looked unfinished abut its all overshadowed by everything after the film overall 910 rating
Mar 29 2024,positive,great for godzilla fans enjoyed it
Mar 29 2024,positive,watched on worlds tallest imax definitely added to the experience the fact that the producers focused more on the actual monsters instead of the people is a huge bonus its a monster movie we want to see the monsters
Mar 29 2024,positive,there is a lot of exposition in it and not a lot of godzilla however if you really enjoy kong youll enjoy the story mostly following him i am personally more of godzilla fan but i enjoyed kongs adventure
Mar 29 2024,negative,lame poorly cast tries to hard to be funny and makes zero sense
Mar 29 2024,positive,this film is such a blast from beginning to end i love that we got less humans and actually they were kind of decent here kong finally got some respect the action and cinematography were top notch this film is just so fun that its few flaws dont matter to me
Mar 29 2024,positive,in my opinion it depends on the person you are to like this movie i honestly loved it but if you want big scale and good narration then you might have a little downsides but i loved it
Mar 29 2024,positive,this movie was so good
Mar 29 2024,positive,zillion dollar cgi budget cant cover for muddled plotting and a wheezing narrative  mindless fun when the titans clash but the movie is entirely overshadowed by the recent godzilla minus one  which is superior in literally every way
Mar 29 2024,positive,nonsensical but a lot of action what do you expect though this is a godzilla and king kong movie its supposed to be like that
Mar 29 2024,positive,i enjoyed the fight scenes and kong
Mar 29 2024,negative,at this point they need to just drop the godzilla name from these movies cause its really all about kong they use the godzilla name to help boost ticket sales and hype this is all about kong the direction adam wingsrd is taking the monsterverse might as well be called the kongsterverse what a let down
Mar 29 2024,positive,even tho most fights were short there was plenty of fights and action to keep you well entertained cant wait for the next one
Mar 29 2024,positive,loved this movie so much if youre a fan of crazy monster action this movie definitely will not disappoint 910
Mar 29 2024,positive,amazing please make more
Mar 29 2024,positive,best movie of 2024 yet
Mar 29 2024,negative,godzilla x kong the new empire is a visually striking monster film whose exhilarating action isnt enough in a messy unemotional and lackadaisical finished product that lacks any depth and urgency in its highly mediocre and tonally imbalanced plot while also having wooden characters and insipid humor
Mar 29 2024,positive,the movie was awesome when godzilla and kong were teaming up
Mar 29 2024,positive,best movie ive seen in 2024 great cgi great action and lots of monsters and godzilla and kong
Mar 29 2024,positive,a fun monster popcorn flick no its not minus one but thats a good thing it was way better than i expected so yeah dont be a stuffed shirt go ahead and see another monster movie and just enjoy the ride boy is it great to be a godzilla these days or what
Mar 29 2024,positive,i think its the best movie the mosterverse has put out so far it was fun i think its worth seeing in the theaters it definitely had its wow moments and the human elements were better i will say that i needed a little more information for the story but im giving it 5 stars because i thoroughly enjoyed myself i would give it a 45 if i could
Mar 29 2024,positive,was really fun as a godzilla and kong fan i really had a ton of fun
Mar 29 2024,positive,best entry of the monsterverse yet loved every second of it and a definite upgrade compared to gvk
Mar 29 2024,positive,these critics will tell you that its bad because of the humans because of the thin story the lack of human dialogues they will tell you that it focuses way too much on the monsters dont believe them because they critique every movie with the same criteria doesnt matter if its oscar worthy masterpiece of a popcorn flick they cant review a movie based on what of movie they are watching sure it aint godzilla minus one but theres no need to repeat the same formula over and over again you already have toho for that with that being said this aint a perfect film but if you are a fan of the monsterverse you will love this movie because yes everything that the critics are pointing out as flaws are the best parts of the movie not much focus on humans and more focus on the monster character and story and then comes the amazing kaiju fights and thats all you ever wanted in these monsterverse it gives you that and theres nothing wrong with enjoying a nice goofy popcorn flick i would give this film 45 stars dont listen to these critics just go watch it and see it for yourselves just strap in and have fun
Mar 29 2024,positive,this is definitely a 35 star movie after coming out of the theatrei felt satisfied with the movie as a whole very surprised at the mixed ratings that scour the internet as it basked a bit more i realized that the critics were mostly right this movie did absolutely nothing and made no impact whatsoever lets get into the good things first the cinematography diverse cast proper song choices entertaining plot and a character selection that properly developed now for the cons the jumpcuts muddled scenes that lose the audience overcomplicated story with too much creative liberty and a nonprofound message that left nothing to the audience and tested no boundaries this movie was as the trailers made it seem fairly meaningless but very entertaining at the same time this is a background movie something you play in the background or watch with a few friends i wouldnt necessarily reccomend against coming to the theatre it is better than expected but how much can a movie about monsters fighting truly bring to the table overall my review out of 10 would be a 75 a relatively run of the mill movie but one that is able to fit into the rest of the story well and keep the viewer entertained it falls short however in the lasting message that it leaves and i found myself leaving with nothing more than when i entered
Mar 29 2024,positive,i dont care what critics said it was amazing monsterverse movie ever i know the theres a goofy  silly scene but the fight scene are top notch  unstoppable     hope we wanted see sequel at 2027 or 2028
Mar 29 2024,positive,just fun  yes some things coulda been done to add more emotional weight to the beautiful monster action but your inner 8yr old will cheer  sometimes they know best
Mar 29 2024,positive,you are going to go absolutely nuts
Mar 29 2024,positive,more titan fights  peak
Mar 29 2024,positive,this is exactly what i want for a monsterverse movie kaijus scenes are more than humans and a dumbfun fight actions
Mar 29 2024,positive,its a comic book come to life a gloriously silly funashell mess that cares little about keeping the plot coherent masking exposition or doing anything interesting with its human characters huge credit to the vfx teams for drawing so much emotion and expression out of the titan facesevery one feels like a fullyrealized character as opposed to an animal just as takashi yamazaki understands the powerful metaphor that godzilla can be  adam wingard understands the fun superhero side of the character
Mar 29 2024,positive,needed more godzilla
Mar 29 2024,positive,godzilla fan so im partial i also saw it in imax 3d so ofcourse it was good nothing special and the last two were much better then this one i was entertained the entire time big plus for that
Mar 29 2024,positive,as much as hollow earth takes away from the scale if the titans my only real negative point on the film gxk is an absolute show of pur unfiltered kaiju action and contains some of the monsterverses most iconic shots
Mar 29 2024,positive,absolutely amazing at a loss of words 
Mar 29 2024,positive,the film is a masterpiece the cgi is great and the fights are captivating and exciting a musthave for every monsterverse fan
Mar 29 2024,positive,i really enjoyed it a blast of a film
Mar 29 2024,positive,does a great job of doing what an action movie should do great fight build ups with a story to tell for all of the characters highly recommended if this is your genre
Mar 29 2024,positive,i prefer this one to godzilla vs kong by far
Mar 29 2024,neutral,soulless and forgettable with no sense of scale or logic the monsters sometimes move like they are regular people which takes me out of it     godzilla looks cool though
Mar 29 2024,positive,even better a second time 
Mar 29 2024,positive,loved it great action
Mar 29 2024,positive,i believe this movie was the best in the monster verse and it had great action in it but it also had a lot of good plots with kong and the humans and godzilla sometimes and it had a lot of great scenes and great cgi and idc if people say godzilla minus one was better i did like it but i also liked this movie a lot as well in which i gived a average 8510 very good movie for 2024
Mar 29 2024,positive,its no godfather but still a great time
Mar 29 2024,positive,it was adorable the characters were fun and engaging and i love pink godzilla
Mar 29 2024,positive,fun movie theres no end credit scenes
Mar 29 2024,positive,it is necessary to understand exactly what we are evaluating here godzilla vs kong the new empire is a delicious flavorful ice cream treat it sets out to be an ice cream and exceeds that evaluating an ice cream as a healthy or nutritious mealfood does not fit into the debate is it a delicious ice cream or not the film is chaotic with rules and an easy script and the human cast serves exclusively to vaguely explain what is happening on screen as the story progresses between the clashes of giant monsters and that is exactly what i paid my ticket for i appreciate reflective and critical films like american fiction and multilayered films like poor things but i want to turn off my brain and have fun in an uncompromising way cinema doesnt necessarily always need to be elaborate and profound it can be chaotic fun and scatterbrained and theres no harm in that the first godzilla x kong came out at the end of the pandemic and god knows how much we needed light and inconsequential fun and this sequel continued on that path see thats whats fascinating about godzilla he can provide absolutely any type of entertainment his audience needs from serious criticism to drama or horror and of course adrenalinenumbing fun
Mar 29 2024,positive,an amazingly fun time
Mar 29 2024,positive,the best romance movie ever
Mar 29 2024,positive,an insane love letter to showa era kaiju films a blast from start to finish
Mar 29 2024,positive,most fun ive had at the movies in quite some time
Mar 29 2024,positive,movie is a blast definitely see it in the biggestloudest theater posable
Mar 29 2024,positive,well worth the money more than i can say for most modern movies its plot isnt deep and human are only there to move things along but the monster action is out of this world if not jaw dropping its not minus one and it not trying to be if we got a serious godzilla movie every few years we would get board go go godzilla
Mar 29 2024,positive,best godzilla x kong in a long time would recommend watching in 3d
Mar 28 2024,positive,this was a action packed movie it was fantastic and great to watch even brought my friends who dont like kaiju movies and they liked it there is alot of hidden gems and interesting tidbits already got my second ticket
Mar 28 2024,positive,loved this one it is now my favorite movie in the monsterverse i walked in as a huge fan of godzilla and loved it all the way through also alot more fighting which i loved
Mar 28 2024,positive,the absolute best movie i ever watched it was great from start to finish would highly recommend watching it
Mar 28 2024,positive,look dont compare this film to minus one because its a different thing altogether at for me  this took me back to a sunday matinee at the lowes triboro in astoria ny in the 60s  like a good old fashioned western the good guys team up to defend the defenseless  mr g kong and well i wont tell lol
Mar 28 2024,positive,that movie was awesome it was really just a showa godzilla movie brought to the modern era now it does lack in the storyline department not so bad like your average michael bay transformers movie but it was noticeably lacking especially with the humans its an overall fundumb movie like pacific rim 1 or yet again the showa godzilla movies trapper was a really loveable character among the humans not so over the top or annoying like most of the humans in the monsterverse dr andrews and jia were good as well i like how big of an importance jia plays in the movie her character arc wasnt half bad i especially love how theyre implementing more monsterverse comic elements into the movies now and making the comics more canon to the main storyline kong and suko were pretty good and of course kong is the main titan again but since adam wingard wants to make another monsterverse movie id like to see him and the team give more focus to godzilla godzilla was certainly badass in this movie his new evolved form looked awesome it was giving off godzilla 2000 vibes but i wish godzilla was more of the stern but caring guardian like he was before gvk give godzilla more character dang it as for the villains skar king was cool threatening smart and downright evil but i believe they were over hyping skar he wasnt nearly as menacing or intimidating as king ghidorah i know they attempted to hide shimo in the marketing but it didnt work in the end so im going to talk about her she was very cool her fight with godzilla was mindlessly awesome and honestly she was more imposing than skar king other than that go watch this movie on the biggest screen possible let the monsterverse continue
Mar 28 2024,positive,truly action packed and epic
Mar 28 2024,negative,to fast they give you all this information about the history of the world then decide to just stop leaving you with this huge hole in the story
Mar 28 2024,positive,the inner king d me lost her mind watching the final fight
Mar 28 2024,positive,i liked godzilla versus kong better but liked the action in this movie was a good movie to reconfirm kong as a titan to be reckoned with be interesting to see where they go from here
Mar 28 2024,positive,overall i enjoyed the movie its definitely the weakest movie in the series but important if you want backstory on kong godzilla and hollow earth      credit to rebecca hall for carrying the human side of the story she did great
Mar 28 2024,positive,this move was not minus one great i had a blast it has flaws human characters are meh but tolerable and the two main stars of the show kill it and not to forget scar king what an interesting character mentally stronger but not physically and lets just say godzilla has his hands fulllike a true 80s vibe cant wait for more from this franchise
Mar 28 2024,neutral,silly after the superb godzilla minus one this was a pure let down its the human characters that are so busy explaining the tech that its only interesting when the monsters are on screen
Mar 28 2024,positive,the greatest movie of all time it was funny but the action was pure cinema since minus one you have to see it now
Mar 28 2024,positive,lots of fun dont read much into it just enjoy the ride
Mar 28 2024,positive,if you love good action and expository dialogue this movie is for you
Mar 28 2024,positive,dont over think it is just a fun rock concert or wrestling match
Mar 28 2024,positive,the little boy in me was jumping up and down with excitement and joy absolutely a fun ride the titans were fantastic as well as the special effects  adam wingard director knows what to give the fans
Mar 28 2024,positive,peak action no monsterverse movie comes even close in action
Mar 28 2024,positive,it was great and by that i mean an incredibly stupid cgifest of ridiculous super kaiju doing pro wrestling on each other which is exactly what i expected and wanted to see so i loved it
Mar 28 2024,positive,i havent seen the movie yet but its a godzilla movie that automatically makes it good
Mar 28 2024,negative,godzilla without his meaning awesome battles but heavy with cringe its like the worst godzilla showa films but with a budget
Mar 28 2024,positive,godzilla x kong is a brilliant time at the cinemakong takes center stage with godzilla being the awesome brute he usually is exploring the hollow earth was fun  and the large scale grandeur of it all was out of this worldthis is the type of movie critics wont like with means it good its for sure a must watch
Mar 28 2024,positive,an absolutely piece of art full of action moments in wich you can just say wow the ending is just the perfect close for the movie and for the godzilla vs kong movies but i think that we are gonna have the story of the mini kong in a next movie
Mar 28 2024,positive,i must admit ive never been a diehard godzilla fan but the recent movies have been surprisingly good on the other hand the king kong films have impressed me     when i heard about the new godzilla vs kong movie i feared it would be filled with cheesy cgi and overthetop action sequences as many modern films tend to be however i was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the cgi in this film although there were moments where it seemed a bit cartoonish it still managed to capture the essence of the fantastical worlds these creatures inhabit     one of the highlights for me was seeing multiple titans on screen and im glad to say that this isnt a spoiler as its already been revealed in the trailer     i dont want to spoil the movie for anyone but i can confidently say that it was a fun and enjoyable experience for all audiences i highly recommend watching this film in theaters to fully appreciate the grandeur of the visuals on the big screen     while i didnt purchase the godzilla popcorn bucket having recently bought the ghostbusters one i can attest that its quite impressive overall godzilla vs kong is a fantastic movie that is definitely worth watching
Mar 28 2024,positive,the movie was epic godzilla and kong are really the best kaiju duos i have ever seenhope to see what the next movie the monsterverse wil give us
Mar 28 2024,positive,if you grew up on saturday morning cartoons this film is for you
Mar 28 2024,positive,godzilla x kong the new empire great movie my entire family loved this movie lots of action and a great human story
Mar 28 2024,positive,id say its entertaining film to watch if you want to have a good time and if you like fun kaiju fights from the past    though sadly the negatives aside from the kaiju parts are with the writing and with the human cast that does sadly feel dull from time to time    but thats more of a hollywood problem i liked it but i can see why others dont given weve got godzilla minus one like three months ago
Mar 28 2024,positive,epic in every way possible by far my favorite godzillakong movie ever made bar none at least 5 ovations some standing throughout the film went to 4pm premier 1st showing so theater 12 full imax gvk had about 10 on its opening all things equal i knew the critics would bash it in advance its ok they are mostly clueless to the genre and dont get me started on the ones comparing it to g m1 which are two entirely different films altogether sure theres many tongue in cheek moments if one chooses to read into them in fact there are plenty of things that go unexplained like how kong got his arm healed before they  how they put it on him just happening to have perfectly fitted spare parts stored away for youll see and the surprise kaiju was totally underused as well as inexplicable in its entire 5 minutes of time in the movie i can go on  onbut none of that stuff matters this is the best time from the first minute to the credits no extras duringafter creds ive ever had as i said in closing i compare it to being on your favorite roller coaster for 2 straight hours in only the good ways finally adam wingard thank you
Mar 28 2024,positive,since ever there are so many trailers and tv spots  i feel not very hype anymore because it showing all the footage in the tv spots but when i seen the movie i realized that that it should be revealed mothra and others titans because its less screen time for others titans and the titans that godzilla fought with it just happened so fast and just 1 minute fight with scylla and others titans but the final fight was amazing i really enjoyed it 6910
Mar 28 2024,positive,adventurous nonstop action loved it
Mar 28 2024,positive,im rating this compared to other popcorn big budget cgi monster type movies if you are going to want to see just a fun action fight movie this is it monsters take a primary role humans are side characters but also not annoying like they once were humor is appropriate and well timed i saw it in pdx 3d and it was fantastic my 15 and 9 year old kids really loved it and they both had huge smiles at the end finally it didnt drag out and the time flew by this is a just go and have fun movie dont over think it
Mar 28 2024,positive,great movie a must see
Mar 28 2024,positive,one of the best scifi movies so far cgi was the bestest part i have never seen this kind of heavy cgi movie ever when titans come you just look at them and forget everything especially godzilla you make sure not to miss this experience in the theaters
Mar 28 2024,positive,absolutely loved it
Mar 28 2024,positive,it was a great movie of both godzilla and kong  a must see
Mar 28 2024,positive,was looking for a fun goofy monster movie with tons of action and epicness and thats what i got ive been fallowing this franchise since 2014 and im certain its heading to the right direction you got toho making more serious godzilla movies and  you got legendary with a more cartoonish style and i love them both
Mar 28 2024,positive,i love the final battle part both those two fighting each other again and not thanks to the moth they are working together again stop that bad ape also some of them are similar like planet of the apes i think and i like it
Mar 28 2024,positive,its a spectacle of the best kind completely leaning in to being way out there more magic than science and yet when i sat in the cinema my thought was new comfort movie unlocked sometimes you just want to see big kaijus fight and you get plenty of that in godzilla x kong the new empire its s wild and roaring ride enjoy it
Mar 28 2024,positive,spoiler free thoughts on godzilla x kong the new empire     if youre looking for monster fun and action from start to finish this movie is for you as suspected its a fun throw back to the showa era for godzillakong fans this movie isnt the story telling masterpiece godzilla minus one is but its very entertaining in its own right the monsters are the stars of the film and dominate screen time you wont go more than few minutes without seeing godzilla or kong the scar king and shimo i found to be nice additions to godzilla and kongs rouges gallery as well there are also plenty of easter eggs for long times godzillakong fans  overall im going 45 stars for this movie of pure monster mayhem
Mar 28 2024,positive,as many might mention this is a movie for fans in the scifi genre cmon people stop the hating and enjoy cool visuals ton of action and cheerful moments with our fav monsters there is very little human action which is just great specially cuz that might be the weakness of the film  i think this one is way better than gvk by far i found the color palette evolution just terrific
Mar 28 2024,positive,awesome really liked the movie especially kong and suko it was an actionpacked buddy cop movie that i needed really enjoyed it
Mar 28 2024,positive,another great monster verse movie i absolutely love the monsters but the humans kind of bore me
Mar 28 2024,positive,i thought the movie was amazing as a personal godzilla fan it kind of fell a little short godzilla skar shimo and jia all had minimal screen time and were underutilized if you are looking for pure monster brawls this is a must see kong felt to be a main character and with suko as his companion it felt as if he was his son absolutely a must see loved it and enjoyed pretty much every minute of it
Mar 28 2024,positive,the movie was amazing 1010 its not minus one and it isnt supposed to be its an amazing godzilla monster verse movie and shows the backstory of scar king how he came to be etc leading up to now and follows the legendary godzilla comics and shows other titans  fantastic movie seeing it a 2nd time
Mar 28 2024,positive,i went for the monster fights and thats what i got 
Mar 28 2024,positive,an amazing monster titan movie the human story is very light the real reason you are here to watch this is for the monsters titans lets make this movie get a green light for a third thats what director adam wingard wants lets give it to him
Mar 28 2024,positive,it was great it wasnt too serious and gave plenty of screen time to the monsters
Mar 28 2024,positive,the action was reallyyy good we just wnated to see the fights
Mar 28 2024,positive,enjoyable if not a bit rushed with convenient moments the movie is fun with dan stevens at least entertaining as a english starlord        the kong and minikong scenes are well done too you feel that bond and its cute the big fights are well done but you know the outcome         japan makes masterpieces like minus one america makes godzilla popcorn flicks
Mar 28 2024,positive,movie was great wish the fights were a little longer and the fight scenes were more unrealistic than the other movies overall i loved it
Mar 28 2024,positive,honestly this movie was amazing godzilla not only fighting for dominace but to kill and kong fans must love this movie because of the feats he accomplished in this movie 1010 best monsterverse movie would recommend
Mar 28 2024,positive,loved the design of the characters and the action was nice im not going to spoil anything but i wish the fight scenes were longer and this movie could have benefited from being like half an hour longer theres 4 specific fight scenes which should have lasted 34 minutes at least but lasted under a minute
Mar 28 2024,positive,it will be difficult for any movie in the near future to beat the graphics and special effects of this movie astonishing visuals a little corny and predictable plot see it in imax 3d if possible
Mar 28 2024,positive,another great entry in the monsterverse hope to see more solo godzilla movies in the future destroy all monsters
Mar 28 2024,positive,the critics that didnt like this movie shouldnt be reviewing this movie    its ok they didnt get it and get what we as godzilla fans want  i wouldnt take a review for old school or king pin and i sure as hell dont care what their opinion is on this movie    you dont ask an opera critic to review a metallica album    a lot of these critics came into this movie with a preconceived idea and it shows    rotten tomatoes critic reviews have become a joke  look at the people who gave this movie a bad rating and then honestly ask yourself if they told you in person if you would even let them finish talking    screw you critics  we dont need you
Mar 28 2024,positive,looooove the new monsters special monster appearance no spoilers here baby kong great throwback feel with the soundtrack and spectacular visuals better visuals than gvk would love more godzilla but whatever its a blast
Mar 28 2024,negative,you know how bad as it looks in the trailers its worse
Mar 28 2024,positive,oh hell yeah weak story but omg the monster rumble action is what i wanted and holly hell did we get it kong is the star of this one and really brought to life in a very human way the special effects are solid and the overall carnage is just breathtaking absolutely riot of a movie loved it
Mar 28 2024,positive,im a massive godzilla fan and my personal favorite of the monsterverse is king of the monsters but the best godzilla movie in my opinion is minus 1 i love the serious darker movies where the monsters move slower it makes them carry more weight and spectacle while godzilla x kong the new empire is dumb fun i really dislike the humorous tone and chaotically quick visuals i still had a good time with this movie but its not as good as i want it to be
Mar 28 2024,positive,please go see this is awesome
Mar 28 2024,positive,this movie was fantastic great acting amazing monster action this movie is the monsterverse greatest installment yet
Mar 28 2024,positive,the movie is incredible and the truth is it feels like the return of two titans to the big screen the bad thing is that scar treats shimu like a dog 
Mar 28 2024,positive,godzilla x kong the new empire was loads of fun was some emotional moments for kong as he discovers others like him skar king is a brutal tyrant of a villain and a nice change of pace from other monsterverse villains godzilla is awesome as always surprisingly more brutal than usual if you wanna see lots of fights godzilla x kong delivers
Mar 28 2024,positive,good it was a little to goofy i love godzilla though
Mar 28 2024,positive,the movie was super enjoyable for the moment it was announced i knew that i was going to see the film and completely avoided spoilers and trailers because i wanted to go on blind and boy was i surprised  if youre a godzilla fan see this movie if youre a king kong fan see this movie  if youre a rmonsterverse fan see the movie     as soon as i got off work i went into my local regal theater to see the movie and i thoroughly emjoyed it
Mar 28 2024,positive,godzilla x kong is a fun ride many colors exciting fight scenes and beautiful landscapes this was a kong story but godzilla shows everyone why hes the boss the character for bernie was not needed at all and i wish we wouldve gotten a back story on the crystal used control over shimo overall a great addition to the monsterverse
Mar 28 2024,positive,this is the best mv film i have seen since gvk shimo was amazing both kong and godzilla was great the human storyline is like a mother and daughter story scar king and he history was good everything about this film was great i give it 10
Mar 28 2024,positive,this movie was incredible it had me crying in some scenes must see skar king is pretty scary but its because he had shimo and godzilla was a beast in this film
Mar 28 2024,negative,just a dumb and bad movie
Mar 28 2024,positive,this is the best movie hands down critics say this movie is completely forgettable which is not this will be one of the best movies to enter since godzilla king of the monsters
Mar 28 2024,positive,amazing it was so good i loved watch the action   and trapper was such a good character it was so worth it but it does have some problems but still worth it
Mar 28 2024,positive,very good moviemothra and godzilla see againthe bad part is no much figth scenes but very good figths
Mar 28 2024,negative,the movie is all special effects that arent all that special the script is pretty lame
Mar 28 2024,positive,critics are nuts because this movie is fire
Mar 28 2024,positive,the battles are so fun
Mar 28 2024,positive,godzilla vs kong the new empire  a titan of a sequel  get ready to rumble  godzilla vs kong the new empire isnt just another monster brawl its a culmination of the monsterverse promising to be the most epic and satisfying sequel yet heres why you absolutely cant miss it    1 awardwinning visuals remember the breathtaking battles of godzilla king of the monsters the new empire takes it a step further director adam wingard known for his meticulous style has promised a visual spectacle unlike any other  early reports suggest a blend of practical effects and cuttingedge cgi creating a truly immersive experience  this dedication to visuals even landed the previous monsterverse film godzilla minus one a historic win at the 2024 oscars for best visual effects    2 evolving titans  the new empire wont just be a bigger fight it will be a smarter one  both godzilla and kong have grown and adapted since their last clash  godzilla crowned undisputed king has honed his atomic breath and strategic prowess  meanwhile kong having discovered a new home within a hidden hollow earth civilization may possess untapped power and technology  this evolution promises a more tactical and unpredictable battle keeping you on the edge of your seat    3 a return to form  many fans felt the monsterverse strayed from its characterdriven roots in king of the monsters  the new empire reportedly brings back the focus on human characters struggling within the shadow of these titans  this could involve familiar faces like dr ilene andrews played by rebecca hall or introduce compelling new heroes facing the consequences of the ongoing monster conflict  this human element adds emotional weight and allows us to connect with the larger story    4 unveiling the hollow earth  previous films only hinted at the mysterious hollow earth a subterranean world rumored to be the origin of these titans  the new empire promises to delve deeper into this fascinating concept  imagine kong leading us through bioluminescent caverns teeming with new creatures perhaps even encountering ancient rivals of godzilla  this exploration could expand the monsterverse mythology in a significant way    5 setting the stage for the future  director wingard has teased that the new empire is just the beginning of a larger vision  with rumors of new monster introductions and potential teamups this film could be the turning point that sets the stage for epic future clashes  being part of this pivotal moment in the monsterverses evolution is an experience you wont want to miss    critical thinking  while hype is exciting its important to be critical  reviews havent hit yet so manage expectations  however the pedigree of the team behind the film coupled with the positive buzz surrounding the visuals and story elements suggests the new empire has a strong chance of living up to its potential    so heres the challenge  do you want a generic monster brawl or do you want to witness the evolution of a cinematic universe  godzilla vs kong the new empire promises to be a visually stunning characterdriven epic that expands the monsterverse in exciting ways  this is a mustwatch for any kaiju fan or anyone who enjoys a good oldfashioned giant monster showdown
Mar 28 2024,positive,the is so enjoyable and it is literally a love letter to showa era godzilla for its kaiju action i love this movie with my heart and soul 
Mar 28 2024,positive,much like the latter toho godzilla films featuring wrestling moves silly anthropomorphic banter and overthetop antics  the film really captures the fun of those films and it works    it was better than we thought and it definitely took me back to being a kid watching the old godzilla films i absolutely loved it for what it was
Mar 28 2024,positive,well this is really masterpiece of the monstersverse but i dont care who is the bad cgi the efect on movie also ant be the future mv just never see and to reference the roar era showa jump the style a wwe or ufc adam wingard is the beats for the next sequel but is do excelent job and save the cinema
Mar 28 2024,positive,i really enjoyed the pacing however it was a little rough with godzilla evolving here and there it never really stuck with godzilla he didnt have much screen time     the general story was really good too i liked how the iwis fit in the story and it was very interesting how the iwis communicated completely silently     the comedy was also really damn funny bernie and trapper are fantastic characters     the soundtrack was phenomenal i really enjoyed the original music and the songs adam brought in     overall fantastic movie i enjoyed it honestly more than minus one however minus one still holds the title of the best godzilla movie its also better than gvk
Mar 28 2024,positive,i loved it from the begining and it ended good  i was all into it i laughed my butt off i thought king kong and godzillia was gonna first but when mothra came back and united they undefeatable against that bad ape it was great movie but i love anything of scifi or good battling evil it was great hey were will ghost buster be shown at next month thnks mr watson
Mar 28 2024,positive,good but they nerft goodziila good sgi recomend
Mar 28 2024,positive,it was visually stunning movie
Mar 28 2024,positive,looks like they dont want us to see the full fish killings  does the makers love fish  but overall what a movie it was heart filled
Mar 28 2024,positive,really fun movie had a blast
Mar 28 2024,positive,amazing movie imo not better than gkotm but still cool movie
Mar 28 2024,positive,its just dumb and safe fun
Mar 28 2024,positive,this movie is epic  love the monster action  godzilla and kong is awesome as a team up  skar king was a cool villain especially since hes an original villain suko is cool too i hope we get to see more of him and kong  shimu was cool as well  shes so big and i love her freeze breath  i hope we get godzilla x kong 3 go have fun with this movie no need to nit pick every little thing this is a fun time 
Mar 28 2024,positive,the titans have undoubtedly returned once again to show whos boss here fully recommended movie the graphics are fantastic and the plot certainly allows you to enjoy a journey with a splendid kong and a godzilla of 10
Mar 28 2024,positive,i saw the movie in australia its great  as an godzilla fan you should see this film as godzilla  kong team up to take down that orangutan tyrant
Mar 28 2024,negative,the lack of diolog was very disapoiting also it moved so fast and to say there were some lacking graphics is an understatment some of the mosters looked like plasic and had no shading i would usaly be fine with this exept for the fact that it was with a main charicter i wont spoil also a few times there would be something throughn and it would have no effect the only redeming quality is the fights these are desenyly good also im clnfused on how its only ph there were some brutal deaths chariters being crusher riped in half or crushed by massive bolders there were also some crigey scene aswel as a sopy one at the end
Mar 28 2024,positive,absolutely amazing movie deserve to be one of the top ten movies of 2024 really loved it100  recommended
Mar 28 2024,positive,not emotional    i would tell you why if i knew    again not emotional
Mar 28 2024,positive,its godzilla its great
Mar 28 2024,positive,one of the best monster verse films ive seen
Mar 28 2024,positive,i loved the movie amazing action limited human time screen much much much enjoyable combat scenes 
Mar 28 2024,positive,i love godzilla fck what the critics say
Mar 28 2024,positive,i just finished watching this movie two hours ago and i really enjoy it
Mar 28 2024,positive,a simple and straighttothepoint plot while it could use a little more of goji himself the heart of kongs storyline vfx and the ballstothewall action more than carry the movie also dan stevens and brian tyree 
Mar 28 2024,positive,enjoyed they embraced the sillyness was a blast at the cinema    i give it 4 cause the story could have been tighter
Mar 28 2024,positive,just amazing its so good  im dying
Mar 28 2024,positive,godzilla x kong is a fabulous movie i heard mumble around me at the preview that it was silly or boring well to note of course its silly its about a giant ape and a giant lizard fighting together in harmony its well animated especially for something put together in some scenes 100 cgi while i admit its a lackluster story with a story you forget but realistically its to get you to those scenes about godzilla and king kong
Mar 28 2024,positive,must watch for every godzilla and kong fans best enjoyable movie of the year epic and awesome
Mar 28 2024,positive,it is a awesome trailer and i think it should be the best movie for 10 years of the monsterverse
Mar 28 2024,negative,this movie is a bullshit     overrated by monsterverse fanboys that they never saw a japan goji movie just this marvel and dc plagiarism    it seems that they only used random cgi in the desire to please the fans with senseless kaiju fights with no background other than the repetitive plot of villain controls villain and hero join forces with another hero to fight for good    this movie is really disappointing in every aspect like all the monsterverse movies i hope toho took away the rights to godzilla from legendary
Mar 28 2024,positive,like a dream watched it with my kidwe both loved it for different reasons him for the epic battles me for the psychedelic dreamy feels the animators did something extraordinary it was all perfect fun
Mar 28 2024,negative,i will make this review short and spoiler free    pros  another decent kong movie  the human characters arent insufferable like the previous installments with gia yet again being the heart of the film   the villains are memorable skar king being intimidating and human like in some aspects with shimo acting as his attack dog      cons  the cgi switches from being the usual outstanding quality to abhorrent due to the smaller budget   godzilla despite being in the title is barely in the film and does very little until the very end   godzillas new evolved form is an interesting and good design with a few major flaws which make it painful to look at those being its anorexic and gangly proportions hopefully the films lead creature designer jared krichevsky listens to the fans and fattens the king of monsters up for the next film  the score composed by tom holkenborg is exceptionally bland and features another instance of tom note for note copying a spiderman suite the score for sonic the hedgehog 2 has a copy of the arachnoverture composed by michael giacchino this time being the of the playstation spiderman suite composed by john paesano    if you ignore the flaws youre in for a decent action film of very little story substance like the previous installments
Mar 28 2024,positive,it was the most badass and most stunning movie ever because i love evolve form of godzilla and kongs new weapon beast glove plus i love mothras appearance and join the battle suko destroys the crystal using the axe in the end it was most awesome and epic movie ever
Mar 28 2024,positive,shocking incredible and above all kaijus on screen all the time without a doubt i loved this new installment my 3rd favorite
Mar 28 2024,positive,fun movie made for fans not for critics the wide variance between critics score and actual moviegoer score proves this out
Mar 28 2024,positive,godzilla x kong the new empire is such a fantastical adventure from start to finish itll always keep you on your toes with stunning new locations fun characters and great monster action but its not just about the scenes of chaotic destruction the non verbal storytelling really transcends what you expect from the genre and delivers something never seen before an experience where we get to stand alongside 300ft tall titans and experience their way of life    but it is flawed the lightning fast pacing makes it hard to really appreciate whats happening the writing can be very contrived and overtly simple and the final fight isnt as impactful as it could be and in the end i couldnt help but feel skar king shimo jia and godzilla were underutilised which is a shame because when they are on screen they shine bright    it is a massively enjoyable and charming film that will only get better on rewatches as i find the little details that i didnt spot on my initial viewing
Mar 28 2024,positive,legendary big monster fight absolutely incredible a monster boom must see in the theaters
Mar 28 2024,positive,incredible addition to the monsterverse packed with action and cgi monster mayhem
Mar 28 2024,positive,i loved it little human drama tons of monsters it was a monster battle royal    kong godzilla in corner a   shimuskar king in corner b  mothra as the outside influence   if only the wwf could get a card like this  non spoiler review full review friday  
Mar 28 2024,positive,any critic watching this and comparing it to minus one doesnt deserve to give a review
Mar 28 2024,positive,great human drama that gets tied up into a nice bow at the end  spectacular monster action  the best movie in the monsterverse
Mar 28 2024,negative,very dull  bad sequel  its extremely bad  forgettable
Mar 28 2024,positive,the movie was fantastic breathtaking in visuals and overall an amazing experience this movie does what it needed to do provide incredible monster fights it sure did     while the human characters arent exactly the best its perfectly fine in the grand scope of things the monsters are the main characters and thats perfect    this movie needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible
Mar 28 2024,positive,very fun movie the action is awesome the scale has improved  godzillas appearances are ponctual and awesome mothra is heartwarming  damn what a great time at theather yet the editing in a few ocasions was so abrupt it seemed a tv cut but all things considered go watch it the bigger the screen the better
Mar 28 2024,positive,i really love this movie  the action scenes of the giant animals are very complete
Mar 28 2024,positive,this is one of the best moster block busters ever made it is very clear on what its trying to be so dont go in thinking this to be another minus one bc its not this film is a through back to the showa era its every thing they hyped it up to be js go in and enjoy js pls dont compare the two there going for 2 very different styles
Mar 28 2024,positive,this film was trurly spectacular i am a huge godzilla fanboy ive been for years this movie is perfect its a dream everyone must see it its insane
Mar 28 2024,positive,i was very interested in the movie the fights and everything draws a lot of attention i hope adam wingard makes more monsterverse movies i dont care if the other opinions are bad for me this movie is the best in the monsterverse for now seriously the fights left me with the impression open mouth
Mar 28 2024,positive,godzilla x kong the new empire is an extremely immaculate movie with spectacular monster fighting sequences decent writing great cgi in my own opinion not so boring human characters mid story    but overall godzilla x kong was very entertaining to watch it was a fun ride i would definitely pay to see it over and over again    long live the monsterverse
Mar 28 2024,positive,it a really good monsterverse movie
Mar 28 2024,positive,this move was lit idk how you guys dont like  the best monster verse movie in my opinion great job  lets finish this trilogy 
Mar 28 2024,negative,the most worthless action movie after the pacific rim uprising they managed to make a movie worse than gvk
Mar 28 2024,positive,i like the action the comedy the drama i give it an 11 i love godzilla and kong in this movie and scar king shimo were good
Mar 28 2024,positive,if you are expecting minus one you will be disappointed however you will smile laugh and jump with excitement with just how crazy and chaotic this film can be and it truly is a blast to watch
Mar 28 2024,positive,i enjoyed the way adam made the monsters have more screentime than the other movies and the chaos is crazy cool and the cgi and fight scenes were a amazing to see in the movie highly recommend it
Mar 28 2024,positive,no words for it just insane
Mar 28 2024,negative,although the movies is good but they should add more to human portion and make them a real part of play rtaer than mere  plot reader dependence on cgi was moderate but should be enhanced this movie showed titan to be smaller which is not good remember how 2014 movie depicted godzilla and in this movie it seems thta they have grown smaller night time battle might improve the battling experience
Mar 28 2024,positive,this film is a spectacle in all its senses it is what the filmmaker and the fan of this genre are looking for crazy monster action incredible battles without interrupting the boring human plot and taking advantage of the monsters great screen time the visual quality is even higher than the other monsterverse films and it is enjoyed from the first minute to the last
Mar 28 2024,positive,u gonna see everything
Mar 28 2024,positive,gxk is a vibrant movie with good monster actionthis move was transparent with what it was going to be in the marketing a shut off your brain type movie and just enjoy the ride and i appreciate that transparency as we live in a time where trailers can be very misleading as to what the move will be kong steals the show but as a fan of the big g i can safely say the big g is used righthe is a power house used to turn the tied in the heroes favor but still gets his moment to show emotionyes the humans are not what we come for but are much better then gvk with trapper stealing the showthis movie goes bonkers and fully leans into it giving us sequences you could only dream    this move has it flawscharacters only existing to expedition dump and move plot alongcgi not the best in some areas ect but for all the flaws theyre outweighed by the positives critics probs wont enjoy the move because it not minus one but at the end of the day if we got a serious big g movie every few years like minus one the novelty wares off the mv helped save toho financialy and whilst as fans we have the right to complain when theres problems we should still give gxk and chance and dont unfairly judge it to a movie in a completely different    genre as long as general audience enjoy and box office pull is strong then id say continue the monsterverse
Mar 28 2024,positive,the best movie ever i think godzilla is more powerful than he was back in 2021 i highly recommend this movie
Mar 28 2024,positive,awesome movie will watch it one more time next week for sure 
Mar 28 2024,positive,as a kaiju fan it is exactly what i wanted godzilla x kong the new empire is a sublime film with vibrant colors and action sequences that are out of this world seeing this picture in imax 3d is an experience ill never forget for me it was awesome you have to watch it no matter what the critics say then decide whether it was bad or absolutely crazy
Mar 28 2024,positive,this movie is cool but the critcs is very dumb and his mothers is dead lmao
Mar 28 2024,positive,godzilla x kong is a good popcorn movie but godzilla vs kong is better than that
Mar 28 2024,neutral,the kong and mini kong moments are the best godzilla is an afterthought the humans as always are the worst part
Mar 28 2024,positive,810 for me really fun movie and enjoyable the human characters are much better than kotm and gvk but it was way to fast paced and skar king was a disappointed villain he was never a threat at all the cgi was decent some shots it looked great and some it looked bad
Mar 28 2024,positive,this is tied as the best installment in the monsterverse although the cgi was wonky at times and some fights ended quickly it didnt matter this movie is a fever dream in the best way possible kong was the main focus and had his moments but godzilla stole the show when it came to giving us the best action possible this is a must see on the biggest screen possible
Mar 28 2024,positive,this movie was insane  definitely going to watch it again 
Mar 28 2024,positive,solid solid movie great action and incredible vfx human storyline iffy bur other than that plenty of kaiju action
Mar 28 2024,positive,this movie is gonna be worth the wait to see in theatres as a godzilla fan
Mar 28 2024,negative,this film doesnt do justice to the monsterverse as a whole it seems out of place and extremely incoherent in many ways it could even be good cheap entertainment with decent cgi but thats not enough to make it a good film pacific rim uprising has a new competitor
Mar 28 2024,positive,godzilla x kong is absolutely awesome 5 stars from me its nothing like godzilla minus one its pure action and i love them both even though theyre polar opposites do yourself a favor  see this movie now
Mar 28 2024,negative,i never thought i would see the greatest cinematic universe of giant monsters be killed by the reckless arrogance of a director who doesnt even know what he is doing a total disrespect for gareth edwards creation
Mar 28 2024,negative,a tremendous lack of respect in every way with the universe created by gareth edwards and mike dougherty
Mar 28 2024,positive,epic amazing and beautiful 
Mar 28 2024,positive,action packed crazy colorful and with a good amount of focus on the monsters a little short on its runtime for the scope of its story still a great time in the movies
Mar 28 2024,positive,great film dont care what critics say 
Mar 28 2024,negative,it was terrible no message no characters
Mar 28 2024,positive,this movie is the culmination of the saga so far i can honestly say youll go into this movie having so much fun i cannot keep my eyes off of the screen with all the excitement and kaiju action in this movie and for the haters if you didnt grow up watching godzilla like most of us then you wont understand the movie nor will you get the fact that this movie was actually good
Mar 28 2024,neutral,its fine certainly nothing special forgot how it ends already bleh
Mar 28 2024,positive,godzilla x kong the new empire  godzilla vs kong    without a doubt i liked the battles between titans much more than in gvk    the plot is the same it even surpasses it    the scenery and the countries that appear 1010    the soundtrack is awesome    and it makes me want to watch it for the 2nd time immediately    it was well worth the wait i need another sequel with such an open ending to more story or to know what titans could come out i have a great hype to know what will happen next
Mar 28 2024,positive,this movie is a monster lovers dream the story prioritizes the titans actions and interactions with humans playing a supporting role the human plot complements the monster action with a heartwarming subplot focused on the motherdaughter bond between ilene and jia
Mar 28 2024,positive,godzilla x kong delivers what fans and moviegoers want  in the colossal clash of titans that is godzilla x kong the new empire warner bros and legendary pictures deliver the ultimate spectacle in the monsterverse saga while its unfair to compare these modern incarnations to the classics from toho or even godzilla minues one godzilla x kong stands tall as the pinnacle of the monsterverse bolstered by the exhilarating monarch apple tv series    from start to finish this film embodies monsterverse magic  it treats audiences to an array of epic battles that hit every mark imaginable its a rollercoaster ride of monstrous proportions best experienced on the largest screen possible like imax one of the films highlights is the introduction of new titans which adds a layer of excitement to the already towering conflict between kong and godzilla watching these iconic beasts receive their own upgrades is a nostalgic delight invoking our inner child moreover the journey into the depths of hollow earth is a visual feast offering stunning vistas and unexpected surprises at every turn    admittedly godzilla x kong leans heavily on cgi which can occasionally result in lessthanperfect creature renderings however with the right mindset viewers can easily overlook these shortcomings and immerse themselves in the sheer fun of the experience clocking in at nearly two hours the films pacing is remarkably tight ensuring that theres never a dull moment while some may argue that certain humancentric scenes could have been trimmed its evident that the studio has learned from past mistakes and dialed back the human element allowing the titans to rightfully take center stage    at its core godzilla x kong the new empire is an actionpacked adventure that sees kong embarking on a quest to reunite with his kin only to uncover a sinister threat lurking beneath the surface of hollow earth its a narrative that sets the stage for the ultimate showdown between kong and godzilla both evolved and more formidable than ever before with an array of new characters breathtaking battle sequences and the longawaited titan teamup godzilla x kong delivers an unmissable continuation of the monsterverse its a highoctane thrill ride packed with humor heartpounding action and pure popcorn movie magic    i give godzilla x kong the new empire 4 out of 5 stars cementing its status as the crown jewel of the monsterverse and a mustsee for fans of largerthanlife entertainment

Mar 28 2024,positive,once again having gotten too excited works against me because what some consider an extremely entertaining and explosive film for me is nothing more than an empty film with moments that are certainly very explosive but scarce it is true that the third act is the best i have seen in this universe of films but the first and second acts are the worst i have seen of it i guess i have to learn to control my excitement about these types of movies so i can better appreciate them for what theyve always been i dont think its the worst movie in the monsterverse but it does feel like a low blow
Mar 28 2024,positive,what i didnt like about the movie  too short  a bit rush  what i like about the movie  everything
