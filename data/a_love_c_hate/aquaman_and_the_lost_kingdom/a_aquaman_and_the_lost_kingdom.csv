Apr 8 2024,neutral,while the sequel to aquaman feels awfully safe and unoriginal jason momoa proves an excellent protagonist for superhero entertainment  even if you can predict the ending before it happens
Apr 7 2024,positive,loved this movie not quite as much as the first one but this was good jason momoa ang gal gadot are definitely the highlight of this dceu underwater scenes are really good great special effects to bad this is the last of the series highly recommend

Mar 31 2024,negative,glad this dc era is over
Mar 31 2024,negative,what a disaster i would not recommend this to anyone
Mar 31 2024,positive,has everything you would want in an aquaman movie and done really well the world under water feels vast he talks to fish he is the king of atlantis as aquaman is supposed to be but pulled off in a way that doesnt bog down the story the plot involves the ecosystem which feels fitting for an aquaman movie and its fun
Mar 31 2024,negative,the movie is self aware of how bad it is  during one of many ludicrous moments a character says you have to be kidding me
Mar 30 2024,positive,cool movie fun and kept us watching but many flaws stood outoverall a enjoyable experience
Mar 29 2024,negative,i dont know if anybody really wonders why they scratched for good this dceu version among all the bad dc movies this one is far worse than any other awful in every sense

Mar 27 2024,negative,surprisingly bad just a lot of exposition and poor dialogue

Mar 25 2024,positive,the dcu is dead long may it rest
Mar 25 2024,negative,jason momoa is charismatic but if youre more ten years old skip this one the script is moronic and the special effects look like a zoom call    its ironic its rated pg13  kind of a catch22     i enjoyed his tmobile commercial better
Mar 24 2024,positive,aquaman so cool on top like always  black manta like that man   the movie was great visual effects perfect
Mar 24 2024,negative,this movie is incredibly mindnumbing aquaman himself is the single most annoying thing in it they took a stoic superhero and turned him into a bro who spews sophomorichumor every two minutes its incredibly irritating then theres the matter of aquamans antagonist in one scene they are a group of scientists diving into the deep waters of antarctica and discovering an artifact and in the very next scene they are gliding through the waters in a superadvanced technology submarinelike vessel raiding atlantean vaults for orichalcum deposits its incredibly moronic this is one movie that i watched out of morbid curiosity to see how it would end all the while wishing it would rush to the conclusion
Mar 24 2024,neutral,i decided to wait until the movie for available on streaming sites for free while there were some comedic lines and good action scenes overall i was not impressed im a fan of jason but this was not his best work nicole kidman looked and sounded different as if they used cgi and voice over for her character i do think patrick wilson did great job i was also not happy that mera was in the film as much as she was i definitley wont be watching it again
Mar 24 2024,positive,as far as im concerned it is way better than the original im not a fan of jason momoa and he did almost ruined this movie however i am a huge fan of patrick wilson i feel like he can save almost any movie hes in he really just nailed this role
Mar 24 2024,negative,simple bad and boring
Mar 24 2024,negative,oh my god what a total catastrophe aquaman isnt a drunk biker idiot hes a fucking king i wouldve enjoyed explosive taco bell diarrhea than watching this mess dc owes me 15 for the ticket 35 for popcorn and a soda and hundreds for my time jason needs to get another job i hear the sewer dept is hiring
Mar 24 2024,positive,typical super hero film filled with action
Mar 23 2024,negative,the movie itself is bad the acting is amatourish the cgi is too much and it even hurts my eyes this film managed to downgrade from the previus one that was a masterpiece
Mar 23 2024,negative,the audience score guided me poorly
Mar 23 2024,positive,it was my first aquaman movie and i enjoyed it  i would  watch the saga again
Mar 22 2024,positive,great action pretty funny as well  the story flowed very well i really liked it  and visually it was awesome
Mar 21 2024,positive,if a comic book came to life with sounds character mannerisms fantastical colors and stories this would be it
Mar 20 2024,negative,the dumbest dc movie ever made aquaman and the lost kingdom needs a burial at sea and it needs to stay there
Mar 20 2024,negative,boring jason momoa looks bored but sometimes funny nicole kidman  a great actress  but her face is from madame tussauds patrick wilson saved the movie

Mar 20 2024,positive,wonderful continuation of jason momoas aquaman visually stunning dc really does this quite well
Mar 20 2024,negative,absolutely awful  one plot hole after another  awful acting weak writing  nothing even original here  you know a typical sequel
Mar 19 2024,positive,absolutely loved this movie would watch a hundred times
Mar 19 2024,positive,great movie there was a lot of action
Mar 18 2024,negative,it couldve been amazing without mera i gave it a chance for the sake if the other actors but she unfortunately was in the whole movie which was a deal breaker there couldve been so many possibilities if not for placating one subpar actor dc is barely holding anyway  this just drowned in a tangle if toxic seaweed save your time  skip it
Mar 18 2024,negative,nobodys innocent not wan not dc not momoa major step down from the first i was not a fan one of the worst comic book films in recent memory patrick wilson is innocent
Mar 18 2024,positive,it lacked  a lot that kept my attention in the first aquaman the fight scenes were not as riveting
Mar 18 2024,positive,aquaman is a reference point and template for comic book adaptations it cannot be accused of poor quality but there is nothing in it that we call brilliant or special its a quality comic book action movie and filmed well
Mar 17 2024,negative,id figure this movie would flunk and like other bad dceu movies this movie was horrible
Mar 17 2024,neutral,completely disappointedhollywood movies every year are worse
Mar 17 2024,positive,this movie is not as awful as critics would have us believe glad all the rumors of amanda heard being written out as mera is unfounded its a fun movie thats entertaining
Mar 17 2024,negative,when the sea worse voice appeared i leave it no way
Mar 16 2024,negative,this movie is awful  there are no redeeming qualities whatsoever if i could figure out how to give it zero stars i would
Mar 16 2024,negative,this wasnt it dc it felt like they new it was gonna fail so they gave it 0 effort for everything the cgi was so was bad i did a better job for a school project in college the acting also convinced me that anyone can act if you want to call that acting yikes overall missed the mark with everything and really makes me sad cause i like jason truly
Mar 16 2024,neutral,not good as the first one 
Mar 16 2024,positive,had a decent time with this one mostly due to jason momoas charisma and goofiness   there were some good concepts and a bit more world building but ultimately it felt very choppy at times it was like watching 2 different movies that were stitched together later i think they probably did alot of reshots or the movie was ruined in the cutting room    also the final battle was extremely disappointing    i still had a bit of fun but its a shame the end result wasnt as good as it could have been especially when aquaman 1 was so good
Mar 15 2024,positive,the movie wasnt as good as the first one but it wasnt bad either i just dont trust these reviews anymore i just cant believe something like captain marvel has a better score than this this movie has both its great and boring moments if you could have eliminated the boring moments its would have been amazing movie
Mar 15 2024,positive,this movie over all was only okay to me    i feel there could be better battles looks kinda cool to me any way    i think there could be more to the second aqua man movie    for the most part the pictures in the movie are nice    over all making an okay movie
Mar 15 2024,negative,given dcs track record with liveaction movies i had low expectations they werent met
Mar 14 2024,positive,i thought it was a really great dc movie it was slow in the beginning but thats really how all movies work it had a great load of action and a really great story line this was a good dc movie to watch and if your a fan of dc im sure you will enjoy it
Mar 13 2024,negative,unimaginitive cheesy and allaround bad
Mar 12 2024,negative,drive another trident in dcs coffin i want so hard for dc to take ar least one of their heroes seriously i suppose i will just have to keep hoping  maybe they can make a movie that will build a bridge to a better dc universe in the future they have an infinite number to choose from now right this was rotten zucchini level
Mar 11 2024,positive,this 2 movie exceeded my expectations with its thrilling storyline stunning visual effects and captivating performances the seamless blend of action adventure and mythology kept me engaged from start to finish i recommend it to anyone seeking an epic underwater adventure and also momoa is on top
Mar 11 2024,positive,i love the aquaman character jason momoa is perfect for the role i love that the movie all took place in a fantasy world really great movie to escape
Mar 11 2024,negative,with this third installment aquaman devolved from a respectable superhero into a petty childish meathead aquaman ceased being a character and morphed into the reallife person of jason mamoa  which seems to be happening in every movie hes in nowadays just let jason be jason because everybody loves jason no just no multiplied by a thousand hard to put into words how terrible this movie is the writing the plot the villain the heros all cringeworthy the ending  holymotherofallcringe
Mar 11 2024,positive,its a very good movie
Mar 11 2024,positive,story line was good not as funny 
Mar 11 2024,positive,the cgi is much better in this movie less cloudy visuals everything looks much clearer great story too including the incorporation of aquamans son 
Mar 11 2024,positive,honestly nothing memorable movie to pass the time and take your mind off work the plot and effects are really sad
Mar 10 2024,neutral,not up to par with other movies of this type
Mar 10 2024,positive,it was very family oriented the screen writing was well written it followed from 1st aquaman an his brothers relationship evolved nicely dont understand why family movies get a bad wrap i could watch it for yrs to come with my grandkids   i think critics get payed to give bad reviews thank god i never listen to them i watch a movie an then decide if i enjoyed it or not
Mar 10 2024,positive,best superhero film in a long time
Mar 10 2024,positive,jason momoa and patrick wilson were fantastic in aquaman and the lost kingdom  the movie also had a phenomenal cast and crew and the visuals were beautiful  it is also surprisingly enlightening about life family and being on this planet together that we all share we all need to strive to get along better with each other and realize our full potential together
Mar 10 2024,negative,felt like i was watching an advertisement for a beer commercial
Mar 10 2024,negative,a telling sign for how bad a movie is is when the studiostreamer sticks commercials in ad nauseum because they know the ads are better than the film  a complete waste of time resources and mamoawilson
Mar 10 2024,negative,this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen that being said i really didnt expect much sad that they seem to make a joke out of this film on purpose 
Mar 10 2024,negative,storyline is just too boring too mushy on the brotherly love and poorly acted
Mar 10 2024,negative,so stupid even cornier than the first the underwater animation is terrible mamoas acting is even worse
Mar 10 2024,positive,great visuals although some things go beyond ridiculous and the fake flowing hair gets old
Mar 9 2024,positive,it was better than the first part
Mar 9 2024,negative,all style no substance the amount of cgi is ridiculous its green lantern all over again
Mar 9 2024,negative,i lasted about 30 min a movie where the world is heating up because of burning fuel and pollution but one of the opening scenes is aquaman doing donuts on a gas powered motorcycle on the beach i dont get it couldnt finish this horrible movie another series that should have stopped at the first movie
Mar 8 2024,neutral,stupid fun worth watching for the end of a messy batch of films this has a few great scenes
Mar 8 2024,negative,one of the worst nonsensical ridiculously bad movies ive ever seen and i actually liked the first aquaman but on this movie its like the writers had no original ideas and just stole from star wars and marvel movies to finish the picture oh and how is nicole kidman patrick wilsons mother when the are only 6 years apart in age in real life the look like they could be dating in this movie just so damn bad
Mar 8 2024,negative,yuck worst movie ive ever seen the script writers combined science magic and aspects from other superhero movies into one horrible amalgamation of misshapen parts franchise fatigue at work again in the dceu the acting was great but the cgi was sloppy and the storyline was downright awful trying to send a climate awareness message and in doing so creating the worst possible movie with the most plot holes ever in one scene they have to free orm from a prison in the desert the whole reason hes there is because no atlantean would go that far inland there is literally water twenty feet away from the prison however
Mar 8 2024,negative,did 13 year old boys write this  because its a lot of hot flaming garbage  i love momoa kidman wilson and park but even though they try their hardest they cant salvage this epic nonsense  honestly there are so many mish mashed storylines it will make your head spin  and then theres the cgi so so so so much of it that its hard to take anything anyone does seriously  also bringing back the big bad from the first movie is a lazy move  i tried really hard to give it a go and had to cut my losses after watching a mere half hour  if youre looking for a fun underwater action adventure watch the animated atlantis at least that is worthy of your time
Mar 7 2024,negative,i dont know if i should laugh or just cringe while shaking my head   im writing this review with an hour still to go of this terrible nonsense i have never written a movie review but i cant help myself this time  because why was this released   it seemed like even the actors didnt want to be there it is a sad ending to the sad dcu franchise that theyve been desperately trying to make like marvel   i would not recommend anyone watch this however if youre like me and have to experience things for yourself no matter what people say well just buckle in its not a fun ride
Mar 7 2024,negative,the worst movie ive seen in recent memory mamoa isnt funny the cgi is bad and everpresent the plot is lame and the dialogue is painful  to put it in a terrible aquamanesque pun this movie flounders do yourself a favor and sea something else
Mar 7 2024,negative,i made an account just to say how bad this was dont waste your time
Mar 5 2024,positive,i actually enjoyed this who knew
Mar 5 2024,negative,i actually enjoyed the first aquaman but this one was soso bad the acting the script the stupid background cgi characters the want to be jaba the hut the storyline you name it it was all bad this is the first review i have ever posted for a move it was truly horrible 
Mar 5 2024,positive,um it was good but i didnt like all the cgi they did better in the 1st one   acting 1063  really good i would recommend watching it if you havent already watched it but it was good and the first one was great too             ps  movienightmarereviewer
Mar 5 2024,positive,a very mediocre movie they dont even hide that it is directly ripping off thor if i wanted to watch cartoons fighting each other i can watch an actual cartoon most of the actors seemed like they would rather be somewhere else it just felt like the only effort put into this movie was the graphics and those werent top notch i wasnt planning on watching thor the dark world again but i guess i just did oh and it was a bit clingy to me that aquaman was calling someone who is obviously older than him little brother
Mar 5 2024,positive,pretty good lots of action and some humor could have done without heard
Mar 5 2024,negative,i was told if i didnt have anything nice to say to keep it to myself well
Mar 4 2024,negative,i wasnt sure if an ai generative model made this along with the storyboard not just the visuals it was pretty bad i dont understand how i made it to the whole thing too many elements mashing together too quickly just seemed very generated which theres nothing wrong i think theres a beauty degenerating things but when you generate it so quickly theres not enough breath or depth
Mar 4 2024,negative,horrible script forced dialogue very cheesy 
Mar 4 2024,negative,the brotherly dynamic momoas curry and wilsons orm is perhaps the one and only saving grace in an otherwise generic cinematic romp
Mar 4 2024,positive,whats wrong with the critics really this is a fun superhero movie superhero movie not an oscar contender so it is what its supposed to be an adventure full of action good humor and an entertaining story
Mar 4 2024,positive,amazing need to make a 3rd one
Mar 4 2024,negative,good cgi but movie lacks heart
Mar 4 2024,negative,dc never disappoints in the lackluster of movie definitely a movie to watch at home to kill meanness time i need aquaman to take a que from ryan reynolds and go to marvel
Mar 4 2024,negative,guys listen please stop making these movies for 14 yr old boys the script is bad the acting is bad the lines are cringeworthy and you guessed it bad please stop it you can still make a good movie thats funny but please make it good first then everything else sheesh
Mar 4 2024,negative,if you were trying to recreate a cheesy 70s tv show congratulations you succeeded
Mar 4 2024,negative,i used to be able to trust audience reviews on rotten tomatoes i dont know how the average audience score was 81 i love to watch super hero movies but this movie was so awful
Mar 4 2024,negative,the cgi in my opinion was terrible it looked so fake  the story was slow and boring i fell asleep around 34 through  the first movie was much better
Mar 3 2024,neutral,i rarely subscribe to the notion that a movie can be so bad that its good but theres a rhythm to aquaman and the lost kingdom that occasionally worked for me i acknowledge so many of the aspects that cause it to fall short but in an era of superhero movies particularly dc superhero movies that are content with being unadventurous at least the lost kingdom finds some glossy overly indulgent ways to be weird it has the usual james wan touch    full review 
Mar 3 2024,negative,superhero movie in which the superheros seemed bored to be there  problems seem core to the writing  dialogue was so simple and bored not sure the cast which seemed good to get around that
Mar 3 2024,positive,this is the dceu version of thor love and thunder they made a joke of what used to be a badass type of hero from the first movie butchered the character and made everything into a joke
Mar 3 2024,negative,this was once again a terrible super hero movie not even the cgi could save it and i am quickly losing faith in the audience score it used to match my reviews but the audience has been failing to provide trustworthy ratings lately the ending of this movie when aquaman did his stupid little wild child scream was a repulsive attempt to be funny i like jason momoa okay but i hate how idiotic and immature aquaman is especially as a king and the baby peeing in aquamans face was completely idiotic and juvenile writing this movie felt like the writers and directors were sick of super hero movies and just want it all to end the super hero films came in with a bang and seem to be leaving with a huge splat aquaman 2 was a pure waste of time im glad i didnt waste money on it and watched it on max instead
Mar 3 2024,negative,not impressed bad acting very cartoonish should have left heard out nicole kidmen not much better pass
Mar 3 2024,positive,jam packed with crazy cgi scenes and predictable plot aquaman lost kingdom didnt quite wow me while its still an enjoyable film it fell short of great
Mar 3 2024,negative,wow this was awful bad acting bad plot line bad bad bad thankful i didnt waste my money in the theater edibles might make it better note i said might i guarantee nothing
Mar 3 2024,negative,im so glad i didnt pay money to sit through that the special effects did not make up for two hours of terrible dialogue preaching about global warming
Mar 3 2024,positive,fun once you settle in and the character relationships take time but worth the movie time special effects are very fungood story and humorlook forward to another
Mar 3 2024,negative,this has got to be the worst movie i have seen in years my girlfriend went to the movie theater and saw it and walked out 40 minutes into it i just watched it on hbo and oh my lord dont waste your time
Mar 3 2024,negative,with the current version of the dcu seeming just about dead may as well piss on the ashes of this version of aquaman  did they really need to bring a baby into it was this the best story they could come up with for aquaman 2  little more than a cgi extravaganza that is bolstered by the dcu brand and characters
Mar 3 2024,negative,a couple funny bits in the first half but mostly bad
Mar 2 2024,positive,ridiculous at times but a straight forward story that was deeply heartfelt i enjoyed the ride 
Mar 2 2024,negative,i was hoping for an action packed and entertaining film for a rainy saturday afternoon but this was just boring and predictable i didnt even finish the movie i like jason momoa but even he couldnt save this movie basically a waste of time
Mar 2 2024,positive,had lots of action and comedy
Mar 2 2024,positive,me and my husband enjoyed it a lot   what happened in ambers personal life is her own business  shes a good actress and im glad that she was in it  ill watch the next one too if there is one  love all the actors
Mar 2 2024,positive,the action was slow it was more about history and family this slowed it down
Mar 2 2024,negative,this was 2 hours of my life i will never get back clunky awful script questionable acting and sub par special effects  my god how did this ever see the light of day
Mar 2 2024,negative,in 2023 there are zero reasons why a movie could have bad cgi and this movie has worse cgi than anything ive seen in the last 20 years bobble headed captain america was even better i really enjoy rewatching the dceu movies but this one is a one time watch and id like my time back
Mar 2 2024,negative,its the worst dc movie ever this movie looks like a marvel movie jokes all the time
Mar 2 2024,negative,i can now say that im not a fan of aquaman movies i didnt enjoy it at all not the action nor the cast or even the plot i will not be giving another chance to a third movie
Mar 2 2024,negative,something to watch while youre doing the dishes
Mar 2 2024,negative,worst special effects ive ever seen too many of them horrible acting
Mar 2 2024,negative,the special effects were mediocre there were glaring plot holes the plot was far from original and the sound effects were cartoonish for example when did orm get a chance for a shower shave a haircut and a new wardrobe on his way back from getting sprung from prison
Mar 2 2024,negative,between the awful cgi and b list actingset design its obvious this was the last movie before james gunn takes over jason mamoa was the only redeeming quality of the whole movie i honestly thought i was watching a power rangers movie at times
Mar 2 2024,negative,one of the worst dcu movies ever aquaman and the lost kingdom was such a bad movie whoever at warner bros studios that allowed this movie to be released to the masses should be in trouble the acting cgi and story were all very terrible its almost like everyone involved gave up on this or something now i really enjoy the first aquaman movie as it was entertaining and action packed with decent visuals this sequel was like a straight to dvd film nothing about this was saying lets release this in the theater im really glad that james gunn has taken over the dcu at warner bros as they certainly need a reboot on all their live action comic book properties excluding the blue beetle trusr me when or if you watch this you will be laughing at how bad the dialogue is in this film what were they thinking aquaman and the lost kingdom gets a very low 1 star out of 5
Mar 2 2024,negative,this is pretty bad and you can tell right from the first scene i still gave it a chance after that and briefly had hope but unfortunately this is really cheesy with an obvious donetodeath plot aquamans wife seems cold and uninterested no chemistry at all  over animated cgi is distracting it blows
Mar 2 2024,negative,what a horrible shambles of comic mythology and slapstick ive never thought momoa was a good choice for aquaman and now the franchise is reduced to this mess aimed at 8year olds
Mar 2 2024,positive,the visuals of this movie are amazing much like the first one the writing however is terrible jason momoa is still the brocharacter throughout the entire movie the cast is incredible but even the big name actors get less screen time which is a shame
Mar 1 2024,negative,too much cqi predictable 
Mar 1 2024,positive,did we really need the star wars bandbar scene   felt like a cartoon i like the cast quite a bit 
Mar 1 2024,negative,it was honestly the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life it made waterworld look like gone with the wind it made hardware wars cgi rival avatar anyone review saying it was good either is fake or theyre 5 years old
Mar 1 2024,negative,i watched about twenty minutes of the movie and turned it off  later i thought id give it a second try and was able to watch another ten minutes before quitting
Mar 1 2024,negative,it was incredibly hard to watch i love jason mamoa but this movie was really bad
Mar 1 2024,negative,a whole lot of cgi to make up for the awful writing i didnt care much for the first movie this one is far worse
Mar 1 2024,positive,i thought this was very entertaining with excess action and plenty of humor by momoa the cinematography coupled with the cgi was outstanding its definitely worth the watch
Mar 1 2024,negative,boring as hell i cant see this again
Mar 1 2024,positive,great movie lots of action and amazing graphics keep you glued to your seat lots of laughs and surprises too i highly recommend that you see this movie
Mar 1 2024,negative,im guessing the script was written by a 5th grader this movie is wowbad
Mar 1 2024,negative,awful visuals bad script and to fast paced there is so much wrong
Mar 1 2024,negative,nah this was not it even the flash was a better sendoff to the dceu than this piece of garbage and i havent even weighed my love for wilson to my disdain for momoa yet
Mar 1 2024,negative,special effects sucked didnt even make it past the first act of the movie literally the best cgi of the first 30 minutes was the title card as a james wan fan i personally think itll do favors to his resume to stay away from superhero movies probably made a fortune though so i cant really blame him
Mar 1 2024,negative,suckedl
Mar 1 2024,negative,this movie makes no sense it is a cocaine fueled fever dream embarrassing
Feb 29 2024,negative,not good at all wow what a gd disappointment my 2 year old cat couldve written or at least scratched out a more coherent script with an actual story to tell never left a superhero movie embarrassed for the lead before
Feb 29 2024,negative,what the hell happened here  from the first movie to this  i couldnt even finish watching it  there are some great actors in here but everything was so wooden    black mantas ship looked like it was a set made in the 60s    horrible dialogue       just bad
Feb 29 2024,positive,its a sequel just as good as the original this movie was visually stunning with great action sequences the dceu doesnt end with a bang but i am officially at peace with what we got
Feb 29 2024,neutral,dc is trying to copy marvel instead of listening to their audience
Feb 29 2024,negative,this is got to be the worst sciencefiction movie i have seen in decades its like the wizard of oz threw up all over it with all its ridiculous color the costumes worn by the protagonist in this film are nothing short of 1950s sciencefiction horribleness you could totally tell nicole kidman was not enjoying making this movie it doesnt really look like anybody enjoyed making this movie aside from jason momoa but it is his movie so he should be enthusiastic the over acting in this movie was so bad i kept having to take breaks while watching it
Feb 29 2024,negative,this movie was stupid all over the place and boring i fell asleep watching it most of the time i disagree with the critics about movies but on this one they are right
Feb 29 2024,negative,its terrible  somehow the plot consistently gets more predictable and more dumb and just when you think its capped itself off it somehow gets even more dumb and more predictablethen you think surely its done but no its not its about to get even more dumb and even more predictable yet again    ai may have written the script  it may have not  but no humans should have been paid for this garbage
Feb 29 2024,negative,cheesy sets bad props horrible acting
Feb 29 2024,negative,definitely not what i expected
Feb 28 2024,neutral,i was hoping that this movie would be better than the first but it wasnt  the cgi is just too too much to bear  the movie also tried to inject humor into it but failed badly i did not find any of the lines funny at all  the plot is good but its just feels implausible that arthur and orm suddenly become best of buddies based on what happened in the first film  heards role is very light i dont think she has 10 minutes of air time in total perhaps by design
Feb 28 2024,positive,better then the first
Feb 28 2024,negative,this movie was so terrible jason mamoa in aquaman and the lost kingdom was the worst the movie didnt even break record on the weekend it was released the graphics where ok but the acting as was terrible jason mamoa is the worst actor for aquaman and the lost kingdom jason mamoa would be a great actor for the lobo character in dc comics but not aquaman the first movie was great but it seems everything went down hill making this movie i would not recommend this movie to anyone
Feb 28 2024,negative,this is a cartoon and a bad one at that the actors interaction with the green screens was not good the dialogue appears written by a twelve year old i feel bad for the actors they are not as bad as the lines they had to say make them appear
Feb 28 2024,negative,this movie was not all that good i thought it might save dc once and for all but nope
Feb 28 2024,negative,remarkably mediocre no character development generic plot handful of very decent actors clearly they blew the whole writer budget on special effects
Feb 28 2024,negative,boring seamen cranking hawgs plot is poorer than an episode of spongebob
Feb 28 2024,negative,impossibly poorly written
Feb 28 2024,neutral,probably the cheesiest dc movie to date too much bright flashy lights sounds and characters lots of filler added laughs and plot gaps
Feb 28 2024,negative,how can a movie be so bad the acting editing graphics story there is not one compliment i can even think of giving this movie
Feb 28 2024,negative,a disappointing ending to the dcu that had so much potential
Feb 27 2024,positive,a little goofy but highly entertaining
Feb 27 2024,negative,not near as good as the first definition of a popcorn movie aka just a time killer
Feb 27 2024,negative,it was unbearable it is impossible to focus literally everything is tired uncreative cgi you feel like you are watching a neverending videogame with annoying dialogues garbage
Feb 26 2024,positive,i enjoyed this movie it was definitely action packed  moved along well enough even though the storyline was predictable its a great movie for all ages ive noticed a lot of negative comments on how adolescent the humor was but not all movies are strictly made for adult children lets welcome the next generation into the dc universe
Feb 26 2024,negative,this movie was filled with so many nonsensical characters and scenes you cant help but ask every 5 minutes how you arrived here cgi looks ridiculously terrible was pretty laughable at how not even the actors give a care in the world
Feb 25 2024,positive,it was good but not the best movie ive seen
Feb 25 2024,positive,a comic book fan  was nice adaption
Feb 25 2024,negative,dreadfully unfunny and juvenile opening reminiscent of the failed thor series poor dialogue and uncreative sets make for an extremely disappointing movie
Feb 25 2024,positive,once again paid critics get it wrong and the audience gets it right  stunning effects welcomed levity and super hero action support a great story  critics really are worthless
Feb 25 2024,positive,mildly amusing although i only watched it for jason momoa 
Feb 24 2024,positive,honestly much better than the first movie of aquaman when he faces his brother however that movie was also good but this one had much better pace and was a fun action packed adventure from start to finish
Feb 24 2024,negative,snore childish and boring the script reminded me of a kids movie or cartoon we would have watched in the 80s
Feb 24 2024,negative,tried to be funny and quirky it failed and was just awkward
Feb 23 2024,negative,aquaman two hits every plot point required of a second installment in a super hero film franchise no time for creativity or an unexpected plot twist the informed viewer could guess each plot beat before it happened nothing leaves a more sour taste in ones mouth than when one of the biggest oil burning industry rags on the very product that allows the world to function in a heavy handed global warming fear mongering film by the end the characters havent changed nor has the world of the story changed each character but maybe orum is the same character as each one was at the beginning of the film ie no character arches the films adventure is superfluous to the dceus overarching world at large
Feb 23 2024,negative,a very difficult movie to see
Feb 23 2024,negative,absolutely nonsensical film there was just a lot of well do this action stuff in this scene and do other action stuff in the next one
Feb 22 2024,positive,not a bad movie but the creature designs are too silly
Feb 22 2024,negative,yeah the less said about this the better going to try and forget this one and only remember the 1st
Feb 22 2024,negative,the movie is terrible  some beautiful special effects but not good to watch
Feb 22 2024,positive,good movie it better than the first one
Feb 21 2024,positive,very good movie funny to 
Feb 21 2024,positive,these glowing 5 star reviews are written by ai make no mistake    this was the worst movie from dc ive seen worse than green lantern  im sure the script was written by ai the ai triggers are familiar scenes that were popular in successful movies in years gone by all stitched together to try make a winning action sequence that is to most people highly predictable  just look at that shoddy unchartered movie as an example of what weve become definitely written by ai    have the directors no shame
Feb 21 2024,positive,overall the film was entertaining with perfect storytelling which made the audience enough engaged didnt feel bored for a sec perfect superhero movie  ending could be better
Feb 20 2024,negative,such a bummer  after such a strong start with aquaman 1 unfortunately the sequel was a huge failure the jokes felt so forced the cgi was somehow worse the storyline was underwhelming and the acting was quite frankly cringy had high hopes for this one and unfortunately i think this dcu is done
Feb 20 2024,positive,good movie didnt blow me away previous movie was honestly better
Feb 20 2024,positive,loved it not as good as one the drawback is to much cgi
Feb 19 2024,positive,absolutely loved it a very worthy sequel high hopes for a thirds installment
Feb 19 2024,positive,for my taste i wouldve want more action and fight scenes but its ok and much more partecipation from mera overall its a nice superhero movie
Feb 19 2024,positive,it was just a generic superhero movie i knew what was going to happen from the beginning
Feb 19 2024,positive,loved the movie great seats and a good experience in general and we had a great time
Feb 19 2024,neutral,aquaman and the lost kingdom falls short of its predecessor lacking the same spark and excitement while jason momoa and patrick wilson deliver strong performances their chemistry isnt enough to overcome a bland story and disappointing main antagonist despite an attempt to inject new life into the franchise with an unlikely alliance between aquaman and his brother orm the film ultimately leaves audiences unsatisfied with a feeling of relief that the series has concluded
Feb 19 2024,positive,i love all of it plenty of action
Feb 19 2024,negative,if this movie wasnt already based underwater it should have drowned from the start but alas no life jacket could save this movie absolutely predictable from start to finish my dog could have written a better script honestly i believe the spongebob movies are better than this dead fish of a movie and we all know plankton would have made a better villain i liked the first movie it was ok fun to view but sadly i wanted to drown myself mentally after this movie didnt have super high expectations coming in to this movie and it went even further to let me down even with this cast
Feb 19 2024,positive,likely the last great dcu movie
Feb 18 2024,negative,well i did managed to watch it till the end there is nothing good in this movie sad demise of cinematography and dc its kinda sad to see nicole kidman and jason momoa falling so low to be forced to act in this movie aquaman was bad but was watchable this is beyond bad
Feb 18 2024,positive,this movie was enjoyable i like the new tone and silly way that it went about it still wasnt my favorite or the best movie out there but still i had a fun time laughing and enjoying myself at the theaters
Feb 18 2024,positive,great movie plot was good and it had some great scenes
Feb 18 2024,negative,movie had a terrible story line it was like they made it up as they go it was like avatar star wars and lord of the rings copied they even have a jaba the hut type scene very fn cheesy special effects were cool but that was it
Feb 18 2024,positive,aquaman 2018 wasnt the best of superhero movies but this sequel improved not only the first installments flaws but nurtured them into an allnew actionpacked showcase that involves some horror elements presented by the guy who did the conjuring    the story is intact the acting is wellmanaged the cgi is improved the action is awesome and the villains arealbeit basic yet intriguing i read reviews stating that the characters are flat the comedy is no good and that people deserved a better sendoff to the dceu and i am baffled at all of it    sure the flash probably should have been the grand finale though that needed better vfx for its own good but the comedy was on the same bar as antman and the wasp thor ragnarok and parts of the avengers the characters are flat justice league and aquaman builds up half of the characters presented the other half is moviespecific this is a sequel youll need at least a base knowledge to get through some of the character arcs    which might i add this movie shows scenes from aquaman to help explain key plot points i dont know where everyones brains have been but this is the most fun i had in a movie in a couple of months    aquaman and the lost kingdom does not deserve the hate it is getting it is a solid installment in the dceu and a great adventure for the king of atlantis
Feb 18 2024,negative,nobody like a fraudster msheard  
Feb 18 2024,positive,i enjoyed it it was a fun film if you dont put too much into it it was the last dceu film that was it so i enjoyed it for what it was seemed like a super hero film from the early 2000s took me back to being a kid
Feb 18 2024,negative,can i remove stars   scenes were fast and scattered the cinematic moments fell short and resulted in moments of cringy attempts of humour  think the little mermaid crossed with star warsexcept this whole messy build up results single shot kill of the bad guy   aquaman in the comics is supposed to be cool this is an injustice to the aquaman legacy
Feb 17 2024,negative,there is absolutely no way these reviews are genuine the movie was complete garbage from the first minute it was bad cgi bad quality lazy story writing bad script bad acting completely pathetic it was unwatchable
Feb 16 2024,neutral,unoffensive and basic storytelling brothers find a way to love each other after they actually just talk instead of bashing their dcks together to dad rock bad guy gonna bad guy no matter what it might do to the planet and themselves randall park is a treasure and must be protected at all cost
Feb 16 2024,positive,i enjoyed it but it did seem a bit meh like the cgi was a bit bad on most parts some of the acting seemed very dull or too forced and not genuine the actual storyline was nice and that poor human dude  scientist guy that justs wants to make things right was really sweet especially when he tried to save the baby this movie was an ok watch but a onetime watch
Feb 16 2024,positive,the effects were great as usual and so was jason mamoa but i think this is where aquaman should end  the first one i really enjoyed but this one was just average to me   time to move onto the next box hit and hang up the costume im afraid
Feb 16 2024,negative,oh this was bad you can feel the disjointed rewrites during it felt like 34 versions of the movie smashed together in the hope it would make sense orm and arthur had some decent dialog and interactions but also some that didnt hit the mark at all half way through it just appears even they gave up and just coasted through  some great visuals but thats about it  shame as enjoyed the first one
Feb 16 2024,positive,seen it on cinema myself the aquaman 2 its not like the 1 but offers spectacular visual effects  humour  sounds and a strong performance from jason momoa as a father and a hero its a strong movie good show
Feb 16 2024,positive,ignore critics  lots of fun
Feb 16 2024,positive,true fans of dc comics wont want to miss this movie regardless of what critics say its important to have a deep appreciation for the comic book lore to fully understand and enjoy the film otherwise its easy to fall into the trap of comparing it to marvel which isnt fair in my opinion its a solid movie the 3d effects cgi and the portrayal of the underwater world are all impressive and contribute to its greatness
Feb 16 2024,negative,boring undeserving of a trilogy it seems like they only made this movie hoping to earn more revenue despite using the same characters as the previous movie and not having a good and distinct plot this is just a moneymaking movie that turned out to be a plop
Feb 16 2024,positive,that was a great movie 100000000000100
Feb 16 2024,negative,i mean i had low expectations but this just stretched the limits but it was a nice long commercial for guinness
Feb 15 2024,positive,it was a bit too busy for my liking  the aquaman character was corny and silly  didnt fit well with the circumstances usually  overall i would say this is just an ok movie
Feb 15 2024,positive,much better then the 1st one good job in this case
Feb 15 2024,positive,love this as much as the first one the characters are fantastic the acting astounding and the visuals  the 3d and 4dx effects made it one of my favorite theater experiences ever also very nice to hop on the train of the failed dceu for this opportunity until it reaches its end station
Feb 15 2024,negative,the movie was meh some jokes are hella cringey   wouldnt watch it again
Feb 15 2024,negative,awful movie dont waste your time
Feb 14 2024,negative,worst of 2024   cringe worthy uninspired poor dialogue bad acting storyline unbelievable they try and cover a rotten egg of a script though incredible cgi but it still falls short
Feb 14 2024,negative,it killed some time and entertained my granddaughter
Feb 14 2024,positive,if you are a big dc fan or just comic book  fan  you will enjoy this movie   thumbs  up
Feb 14 2024,positive,could have been more action
Feb 14 2024,positive,love the cinematography
Feb 14 2024,positive,it was nice but i expect more
Feb 14 2024,negative,this movie was very boring boring boring i wouldnt recommend it to any of my family members at all
Feb 13 2024,positive,loved the special effects
Feb 13 2024,positive,solid superhero flick tonally better than the first  flows much more smoothly
Feb 12 2024,positive,the movie is fun i absolutely enjoyed it
Feb 12 2024,negative,all i have to say is it sucked
Feb 12 2024,positive,i loved this second film i hope there is a sequel i really want to see arthurs son growing up
Feb 12 2024,positive,it was a superhero movie lots of action lots of fun i enjoyed it its a movie that is best viewed at a movie theater on a large screen
Feb 12 2024,negative,boring movie with cliche story line and bad acting fight scene were meh too
Feb 12 2024,neutral,i just recently found out that the sequel was released so decided to check it out the villains grand plan was a bit weak he got this super powerful tool and was defeated soo easily kind of a bit of a let down how easily aquaman and his brother who are buddies now destroyed the tridentlike why didnt the king that cast the curse do that in the first place why preserve the whole city in ice instead of destroying it the cgi was pretty okay their underwater talking scenes looked a bit weird but that was about it still dont get why atlantis has to be revealed to the rest of the world or maybe i forgot the reason from the first movie it wasnt exactly on the same scale as wakandas reveal to the world
Feb 12 2024,positive,my husband  i really enjoyed it i loved it so much that im ready to see it again now
Feb 12 2024,positive,the aquaman movie was good
Feb 12 2024,negative,beyond garbage wish i could get a refund
Feb 11 2024,neutral,whereas the first aquaman was an energetic rollercoaster ride from start to finish this new mcguffin treasure hunt takes bigger and louder to a place where it mostly just becomes nonsensical and obvious a loosely connected series of set pieces filled with poor cgi and a main character whos so busy being either a frat bro or a quip machine its hard to remind yourself the same james wan was behind this then again it is once again undeniably entertaining with its outlandish and colorful setting
Feb 11 2024,negative,i really didnt like this movie to be honest for one it kept dragging on and felt twice as long than it really was i guess that happens when you are not enjoying a movie though all of the humor fell flat for me which was probably my biggest problem with it it also had very heavy handed themes that it did not handle well cheesy and cliched dialogue mediocre acting and a generic boring story i just wanted it to end and was glad when it finally did the only positive was that patrick wilson and jason momoa worked pretty well together but it wasnt enough to save the movie
Feb 11 2024,negative,this was horrible the script was bad the action jerky and uneven the actors didnt seem challenged sigh high hopes but it ended up two hours too long
Feb 10 2024,neutral,i really enjoy dc comics and am a big fan of theirs butthe first 1520 mins made me want to turn it off because i thought i was watching another adventures in babysitting movie seriously they couldve left out the baby entirely and it wouldnt have changed anything with altering how he was going to get the blood and better used that time for more plot and character building the humor was pretty corny in places and the cgi was bad in places too i really wanted to like this movie more but it just was a bit of a letdown if im being honest you can tell since gunn took over they just flushed these projects out to be done with them sad times
Feb 9 2024,negative,meh  good action and special effects  i like jason mamoa as aquaman but rather than funny he comes across as downright goofy at times  aquaman already has enough trouble being taken seriously as a superhero  why make him a dork  also could have done without the swearing    and i predict that the anthropogenic climate change theme will quickly become dated given how fast the science and its predictions are changing
Feb 9 2024,positive,it was an epic sequel for the movie i was hesitant because i took the critics opinion of this movie and ran with it seen it with my wife and it was a good addition to the jason mamoa rendition of aquaman i could see this continuing on despite the renewal of dc
Feb 9 2024,positive,exciting but stupid i can not stand arthur always pissed on his face its for shame its obvious that the film was very much cut during film editing the villain was shamefully leaked but the world and jokes were ok
Feb 9 2024,positive,omggggggg me and my husband we amazed in how amazing this movie was best aquaman movie please go watch if yall havent you wont regret it
Feb 8 2024,positive,it was okay  nothing i would watch too often but it was something to do whilst folding the laundry
Feb 8 2024,positive,i enjoyed the brotherhood family love and aquamans usual unrestrained style
Feb 8 2024,positive,interesting story line and character developmentrelationships if you like super her movies aquaman delivers the fun humor action and fight scenes you would expect
Feb 7 2024,negative,nice visual effects script mustve been written by a 12 year old aquaman and his bro given scripts meant for a teenagerdefinitely not for adults falls far below the quality of aquaman 1
Feb 7 2024,positive,this was a great movie shows never underestimate the wrath of mamma when you mess with her child and the true bond between brothers i see the opening for another aquaman i look forward to it  sure some will slways like part one best but if you are a true fan of aquaman the man you will love all he does go aquaman i love you 
Feb 6 2024,positive,nonstop action very entertaining
Feb 6 2024,negative,walked out of the movies the movie was all over the show didnt look real didnt make sense and was just to bad wouldnt recommend
Feb 6 2024,negative,please stop the massacre
Feb 6 2024,negative,there were countless flashbacks aimed directly at the viewer which concealed a cinematographic incompetence in exploiting important stories in the script the heroes were uncharismatic and pulled out of a hat some scenes remain memorable but the film as a whole is very disappointing
Feb 5 2024,positive,funny and chemistry between orm and aquaman is satisfying
Feb 5 2024,neutral,needs more mera action
Feb 5 2024,positive,aquaman and the lost  kingdom  69  it was not nearly as bad as the original critics that came out and scared everyone the story has a lot of good action scenes very similar to the first one once again jason momoa really dives into this role and embodies what i would think aquaman would be like yes the story is corny and there are a lot of like what is even happening moments but for a superhero action movie it was definitely entertaining it was a good sign after the initial twitter leak that the son died was false that would have been a major flag it is visually beautiful the way they build this whole entire underwater world of atlantis and now of the lost kingdom as well even though it looks like video games at times it really still blows you away in the visuals  the script is isnt the bread and butter its really all about the action if you can just accept that part it is worth the ride sad to see this dceu go down it was not the best ride but i enjoyed it the final scene was something a little copycat action of the l am ironman of the marvel universe official sundaynightstreaming rating of 69
Feb 5 2024,positive,there is a reason why this movie is breaking box office records worldwide my wife and i both loved it we had a great time and will likely purchase it on bluray when its released five stars highly recommended the nitpicking negative critics are all wrong and have zero credibility as they frequently give glowing reviews to absolute garbage that nobody sees ignore them
Feb 5 2024,negative,im a dc fan and this honestly makes me miss the george clooney batman film jokes that are not funny a story thats from a 3 year olds bedtime story jason mamoa not realising hes not a fraction cool as he thinks he is and even a corny rock song at the start and cgi thats going to date badly its like a bad marvel movie so much that you have to wonder if james gunn was involved in the editing
Feb 5 2024,positive,great followup to the previous movie the story line moved along and was connected nicely took my nine year old nephew and he liked the story action and message im also glad that it was just under two hours good fun
Feb 5 2024,positive,if you liked the first one you will like this one  a very capable action movie with some good humor  its an action movie filled with cgi  this is what it is and if you like that type of stuff   its great and fully entertaining  if youre a professional critic who needs drama  the movie would suck hence their silly impractical reviews 
Feb 4 2024,neutral,i think we can all agree that the tired formula of superheros is all but over if this movie came out 10 years it would have been successful its not 10 years ago and im sorry but i was bored watching it as ive seen the same thing multiple times jason was cool and so is patrick but the cgi festival has been done over and over you can see a lot of work has been put in bringing this to the big screen and i feel bad not many people went to see time to shelve these movies james gunn reboot will fail the genre is over when you go the route of multiverses you know they have run out of ideas
Feb 4 2024,positive,seriously the critics giving this a 34 is ridiculous we watched this movie while lit and just the visuals and sound effects alone make it a good movie
Feb 4 2024,positive,it was action packed
Feb 4 2024,positive,great movie loved it a whole lot better than the first one
Feb 4 2024,negative,lol what nonsense did i watch dc is losing its mind
Feb 4 2024,positive,no complainnot the best but okay
Feb 4 2024,positive,pretty silly lame jokes some absolutely no sense moment but aquaman and master of the ocean chemistry nailed it deserves a second change for a third movie without those thor 3 jokes
Feb 3 2024,positive,i loved it exactly for what i paid for i wanted to see an entertaining movie and that is what i got
Feb 3 2024,positive,actually enjoyed this sequel more than the original aquaman as the buddy flick with the brothers was quite fun jason momoa  patrick wilson have good chemistry and had a good resolution
Feb 3 2024,positive,loved the movie it was great should be another one about the babys powers now
Feb 3 2024,positive,the story line and all the action kept it interesting through the whole movie
Feb 3 2024,negative,worst way you can end a series this movie had some of the worst acting ive ever seen and terrible story plus that ending what the hell was that not worth wasting your time with this movie
Feb 3 2024,positive,i loved this movie a great mix between action comedy and love the storyline was great and kept us on our toes the entire time i loved how they made orm and arthur bond on this film and the relationship they built from it
Feb 3 2024,positive,absolutely loved this movie   did not disappoint compared to the first one 
Feb 3 2024,positive,it has great plot and a great plot work warlovefamily and community
Feb 3 2024,positive,it was a pretty good movie i enjoyed it
Feb 2 2024,positive,i really enjoyed this movie i loved the plot and personally i never found a dull moment loved the cast as well however i just felt like there was something missing from the movie im not too sure what maybe some more action sequences i left the movie theatre unsatisfied with its ending  but i recommend watching anyway
Feb 2 2024,negative,too campy and predictable very disappointed in the writing and acting hate to see nichole kidman reduced to this junk shes too good of an actress
Feb 2 2024,positive,fast noisy vfxfilled cartoonish but fun thx to jason momoa entertaining albeit with a story that draws from the many previous similar adventures that came before
Feb 1 2024,positive,i fell asleep about 30 min into it and it wasnt that entertaining it picked up for the second half but still nothing amazing i did like the ending though great feel good ending
Feb 1 2024,positive,although not as good as the first one the lost kingdom is a decent sequel with a great story and action scenes some of the cgi and vfx effects are questionable though
Jan 31 2024,negative,as much for the final chapter to the dceu aquaman  the lost kingdom failed to make a splash that tries too hard which ended with rather disasterous results
Jan 31 2024,positive,honestly i really enjoyed it not as bad as i thought it was going to be
Jan 31 2024,positive,i actually liked this movie  it was cool to see the bothers reacting to each other with snide remarks to one anotherjust like real siblings act towards each other at times  there was some parts that were kinda ridiculous but thats a part of what made it a funny watch in my opinion  orm was awesome and redeems himself and topo was great too
Jan 31 2024,negative,it was like watching a repeat of star wars
Jan 30 2024,negative,aquaman 2 was lost from the start the story is kind of generic but at least follows the first one the acting is bland and robotic orm is the best of them one fun part was all the dialogues and interactions of the two brothers the cgi is actually quite good but from the middle to the ending the composition falls apart its atrocious at the end the action is decent i give it 52 overall it does show that this was doomed from the start average at best the first one had a better structure better story
Jan 30 2024,positive,this movie brought more than expected and more story to aquamans character and what we expect him to truly become its a definite in my opinion meant for a rewatch in conclusion i enjoyed it nonetheless
Jan 30 2024,negative,somethings wrong with dc jason mamoa is incredible for aquaman but wow was this bad
Jan 30 2024,positive,kick butt fight scenes and beautiful landscapes
Jan 30 2024,negative,to call this lackluster is an understatement the production looked cheap as borscht lame looking sets and did i see oompa loompas seriously this could of been a great movie but instead it makes spy kids look like a blockbuster
Jan 30 2024,positive,great fun and creative
Jan 30 2024,negative,it seems to be geared for jr high the story is a bunch of plot ideas ideas  mismashed together  and many scenes that drag the main villian was not even scary he spent the while movie frozen and then died in one blow  and the dialogue in so many spots is not at all how people talk
Jan 30 2024,negative,corny way too much cgi plot was meh too long kept repeating same fight sequences how many times does the bad guy get his spear knocked away last second
Jan 30 2024,negative,i wasnt expecting shawshank i was expecting a fun ride it started ok and randall park as dr stephen shin nails most of his scenes although the writing did not help him he is a riot xd     tldr this felt like a videogame except it wasnt consistent    the movies high points were when the humour landed sadly it didnt do so very often    the story feels disjointed so its possibly the editors fault but the writing was just subpar i mean im gonna kill me a dead mermaid  really he was not a meat head so why is he suddenly talking like a mindless thug thats just one example there are too many    finally the special effects were hit and miss sometimes they were simply awesome and other times i felt like someone said ah f it no one will notice if this looks like 1990s sfx    we noticed we noticed
Jan 29 2024,positive,nice story line with plenty of action plus loved the colors
Jan 29 2024,negative,while wan possesses a visual flair and animation style suitable for a film predominantly shot underwater he significantly lacks in storytelling chemistry and plot development this film feels like a disregard for the fans who supported its first installment not only from a directorial standpoint but also in its lead and supporting actors performances its apparent that jason momoa and the supporting cast are disengaged with the possible exception of wilson who once again proves to be the only compelling actor on screen the film underscores that studios should not interfere with or produce films solely as a precursor to larger future cinematic projects no redeeming qualities are evident the narrative lacks coherence the actors seem uninterested and it appears the film was hastily released to recoup production costs this should serve as a deterrent against casting actors like jason momoa in future projects unless they improve their acting skills
Jan 29 2024,negative,lets toss in everything and the kitchen sink bigger isnt better life has jokes yes but when making the film try and think of what the characters are feeling please dont make every movie for kidsmore like watchmen less like barbie
Jan 29 2024,positive,dont care what critics or others say great fun visuals comedy and drama slight bit too much rubbery cgi if you know what i mean but that said an awesome flick if you still love superhero movies
Jan 29 2024,positive,greet movie love the dc universe
Jan 29 2024,positive,we liked the movie  if you decide to go and watch it we think you will enjoy it
Jan 29 2024,positive,great special effects storyline was easy to follow and there was the dash of humor that made it fun too
Jan 28 2024,negative,it did not live up to its potential by far
Jan 28 2024,positive,aquaman and the lost kingdom was a fitting end to close out the dceu while it may not have made the staggering 1 billion dollar amount that its predecessor did which is the highest grossing movie of the dceu it is a very fun movie that does not drag on and is on the lighter side of dceu movies runtime does not drag on and the on screen chemistry between mamoa and wilson is undeniable they seemed to have so much fun together and their brotherly dynamic is the best part of this movie this movie ultimately closes off a mid tier at best run of the dceu and is not necessary viewing unfortunately which drove the box office lower even though it was at 400 million worldwide almost an unimportant overall end to a series of movies that had their flaws but had some really high highs in terms of the comic book universe with the end though we welcome in the beginning of gunns dcu the anticipation should be high but so is the pressure to perform while i do not believe superman has to be a box office blockbuster it does need to be profitable and be a wellreceived opening to his new shared universe i have all the fait in gunna and the cast he has assembled has me all hyped and welcoming the year 2025 in conclusion i give aquaman and the lost kingdom a 68100 not to the high end of the fist one but a fun installment and a movie that when on streaming i recommend you and the family tune into for a night of fun laughs and action sequences
Jan 28 2024,negative,silly sod its like watching a computer game predictable through and through as though the film was written by hollywood execs i cant see any of the directors stamp on it will steer away from james wans films for a while
Jan 28 2024,positive,i had way more fun than i thought i would the narrative around this movie was so negative but after watching it i can say it was deserved
Jan 28 2024,positive,fun and entertaining much better than the 1st one
Jan 28 2024,positive,the movie is a good light follow up to the original sometimes you wish they put more depth into the story but that didnt happen the visuals and action are great over all i enjoyed my time watching it and walking feeling pretty satisfied would recommend the watch
Jan 28 2024,negative,liked the first one didnt like this one  its as though the writers and director didnt take the story seriously too many flippant and unneeded jokes and landinhome scenes a littler too down to earth   the beer drinking babysitting dad scenes didnt fit with the super powered action heroes iron man home scenes fit the story and motif better   an ancient supernatural trident artifact which takes over your mind and makes you evil and powerful is not a good play on reasons why people do what they do nor makes for a good movie plot
Jan 28 2024,neutral,the movie went on and on without much excitement the special effects were not very good and were almost cartoon style
Jan 28 2024,positive,i think this movie was better than the first one it had a great story line to the movie
Jan 28 2024,positive,it is a enjoyable adventure and has some fun scenes but it definitely should have not been the dceus final film
Jan 28 2024,positive,it wasnt terribly bad it  wasnt as good as the 1st   2nd  aquaman i could have waited for it to come on disney plus  it gave me a little mix of indiana jones prates of the caribbean star wars gardians of the galaxy and i can add others however since i dont have the talent nor the money to even write or produce a movie i shall stop here its something to do with the family
Jan 28 2024,negative,almost watchable but i almost fell asleep too 
Jan 28 2024,positive,this was a fun and entertaining movie i liked all the characters and the way they evolved thorough the movie ill watch it again
Jan 28 2024,positive,this movie was awesome ill be back
Jan 28 2024,negative,all i can say is this is not worth anyones time it isnt outright bad but its like a 6th grader was hired to right this movie its so bland and uninspired its completely textbook    the only reason to watch this movie is if you want help going to sleep
Jan 28 2024,positive,very good fun movie
Jan 28 2024,negative,unconvincing acting cheap special effects quick and predictable ending one of the worst movies of its type
Jan 28 2024,positive,good plot lots of action would recommend aquaman finds his old enemy is back  only one person can help him defeat this enemy his half brother only problem is he is exhiled in an prison  know one knows the location he must find his brother break him out of prison  hope he is so grateful for freedom he wont be bitter that aquaman is the one who caused him to be there originally
Jan 28 2024,positive,loved it humor and seriousness
Jan 28 2024,negative,the writing for this movie should be enough to end the strike im gonna kill me a dead mermaid really watch at your own risk and have a drink or two standing by
Jan 28 2024,negative,i wanted to love it but wow umm i need a minute to process what i just saw  i wished as i watched the movie i could fast forward to the end and get it over with the plot was good for a movie like this  but im still trying to figure out what in the world were the writers thinking when they wrote those lines for the actors  i love dc comics and their movies and the first aquaman movie was awesome but it felt and looked like the acting was pretty bad because of their lines and some parts of the action just looked a bit fake  hello we know its all fiction but seriously watching any movie like this you want to feel like its real  this is my first review of a movie on here  i got on just to leave a review because i guess my expectations were so high of what was to be of the movie that i was just disappointed
Jan 27 2024,negative,this is the perfect closing to the dc movies its pretty bad bad jokes bad acting its just bad
Jan 27 2024,neutral,super corny but was fun to watch jason mamoa can not act so he makes a good aquaman
Jan 27 2024,positive,the movie while is not as good as the first one it is not as terrible as everyone is thinking this movie is dumb fun and a visual treat and the phenomenal cinematography visuals and direction of james wan movies was ever present in this movie however the character development was all over the place and the movie felt kinda short and unsatisfactory as a story the villlains could be better written and stronger in this movie the brothers bond and comedy did not work that much and did not have any emotional impact overall i would say it was a mixed bag but and entertaining one time watch
Jan 27 2024,neutral,it was average at best
Jan 27 2024,negative,like a saturday morning cartoon a disappointing sequel to a very cool adventure into the dceu many jokes characters and fight scenes do not pack the punch like the original still visually stunning with good performances from the first films villains manta and orm and dr shin this is the film expected of aquaman prior to mamoa making him cool unfortunately a sad conclusion to a universe with such potential this fish just aint fresh 4 out of 10
Jan 27 2024,negative,i loved aquaman but seeing ambers face in it ruined it for me 
Jan 27 2024,positive,better as the first  technical effects are perfects excellent story good actors
Jan 27 2024,negative,i am only giving it this much because the star did such a great job in the snl skit of elf on the shelf but this along with the rest of the action movies lately is a total waste of time fantasy has devolved into total nonsense and no amount of suspension of disbelief can fix any of them in the last couple of years
Jan 27 2024,negative,jason thinks hes super hot a lot of cringe moments in this movie
Jan 27 2024,positive,good adventure and union with a happy ending and pleased greenpeace what else you can ask for more
Jan 27 2024,negative,i suppose there are worse movies out there but i barely made it 7 minutes in before i felt the urge to flee i managed to make it through but i really regret inflicting this kind of torture on myself film schools should use this film as a cautionary tutorial in how not to make a film    bad acting bad writing bad directing everything about it was painfully bad im not even sure why they bothered with real actors everything was cgi it couldve been shot in a gas station bathroom with green walls it was a mindnumbing full frontal assault on the senses    no one should put themselves through this type of punishment avoid at all costs
Jan 27 2024,positive,i thought the movie was really good  i loved the action and special effects they put in the movie i would see it again and again
Jan 27 2024,positive,cant judge on trailor but i loved aquaman momoa is amazing and funny brings the marvel feels to dc if heard its in it im out though  doesnt feature at all in trailer going theyve taken the hint
Jan 26 2024,positive,dcs attempt at a thor ragnarok vibe  didnt work  it seemed very choppily edited together haphazard score and some awful dialogue  sets up a big finale which then ends with a laughable whimper  i guess the die hard fan vote or low expectations has led to the current 81 score
Jan 26 2024,negative,this movie was thrown together not thought through and completely incoherent all these magical places make no sense without a decent story
Jan 26 2024,positive,pretty good but wanted it to be so much better
Jan 26 2024,negative,this movie tries so hard to be everything and becomes nothing at all  we see transformers star wars  cast away  lord of the rings you name it   such a shame how low the bar has been set for these movies
Jan 26 2024,positive,way better movie than the marvels at least this one has good story to it
Jan 26 2024,positive,it was enjoyable to watch but just a very generic superhero movie nothing really special about it
Jan 26 2024,positive,it honestly felt like no one cared when they were making this the first movie was so much better this felt like it had no heart if you just wanna zone out and watch a pointless action flick this is the movie for you
Jan 26 2024,negative,ending was terrible he died after one hit thats absolutely crazy
Jan 26 2024,positive,this movie is fun i was very impressed with it funny and over the top but still fun
Jan 25 2024,positive,great moral storyorms redemption arc brotherly love save the environment
Jan 25 2024,positive,mid as fck but fun for first time
Jan 25 2024,positive,ive read all critics and audience reviews and i know everyone is entitled to their own thoughts but lets all stop behaving like we are all expert directors and admit that the movie is actually nice  people will always find faults in every movie
Jan 25 2024,positive,the movie was great please rotten tomatoes change your score from 34 rotten to 80 certified fresh
Jan 25 2024,negative,what was the point just seemed like filler a time waster nothing original no story we have not seen 100 x of late acting so so
Jan 25 2024,positive,went and saw this with my girlfriend and we both loved it great movie
Jan 25 2024,positive,incredibly heavy handed message super rough vfx and a half baked story but the banter between mamoa and wilson keep this movie entertaining enough at least its better than the first movie
Jan 25 2024,positive,very fun not very original but if you like aquaman lord of the rings and the phantom then its a good time some cheeseball phrases thrown in to show their allegiance to the elites and their messaging im thinking building bridges but that is minimal and excusable good dynamic between the brothers and just lots of fun
Jan 25 2024,negative,this movie is way too long some funny  scenes in it
Jan 25 2024,positive,enjoyed the movie
Jan 25 2024,positive,well done great movie love jason mamoa is and always will be aquaman
Jan 25 2024,negative,i almost left the theater but i decided to stay and almost fell asleep i dont fall asleep in theaters
Jan 25 2024,negative,just watched aquabro ragnarök and i gotta say didnt care for it why do so many movies try to copy thor ragnarok with the slapstick type stuff thor did it sort of and did it right but too many superhero movies have tried so hard to yuck it up since then that its just cringe i fast forwarded through a lot of the movie because it was just dumb it almost seemed like whoever wrote this movie didnt even see the original aquaman movie i love all the good superhero movies like marvel and theres even a few good dc ones like the recent flash and of course james gunns suicide squad could i write a better movie probably not but i dont think i could write a worse one not a keeper
Jan 24 2024,negative,james gunn enough said plenty of horrible punch lines and bad comedy
Jan 24 2024,negative,almost unwatchable laughable story line and awful special effects the only thing that could have saved this car crash of a movie would have been the charisma and screen presence of jason momoa but due to the poor script and direction he wasnt given a chance to shine
Jan 24 2024,neutral,just better than the first one
Jan 24 2024,positive,fun but way too busy overloaded with cgi
Jan 24 2024,positive,it was not as good as the first one
Jan 24 2024,positive,after the recent failures of dc movies it is an improvement the humor is perfect and the story is decent enough to follow the action seems like a carbon copy of the first aquaman film including the villain a decent movie on its own but when placed among other dc movies it seems to be lost in the shuffle
Jan 24 2024,neutral,made me think of flash gordon 1980 flash gordon was cool in 1980 not so much in 2023
Jan 24 2024,negative,super boring and killed off a villan way too quickly
Jan 24 2024,positive,mad silly mad fun thats all i got for this one
Jan 24 2024,neutral,not terrible   it felt like they stole several scenesplot points from other movies like lotr star wars and thor  there are however worse ways to pass the time  topo was a great character
Jan 24 2024,negative,no just no why would anyone give this a good review its clearly garbage fro the first 20 minutes still like jason momoa but cant say anything good about this movie
Jan 24 2024,negative,honestly just a horrible movie that i dont recommend anyone watches fell asleep because of how boring the plot was
Jan 24 2024,positive,i gotta be honest it wasnt that bad to me   pros actions was good colors were vibrant pq was overall clean story was pretty good  cons mamoa looked much bigger or screen the audio seemed mainly focused on the lcrs the cgi was abysmal for human characters  it was fun to see aquamans sense of humor with his brother
Jan 24 2024,negative,not so bad than the last marvels but not good a fun film rip dcu 
Jan 24 2024,negative,its bad i dont recommend watching it
Jan 24 2024,negative,the biggest foe aquaman faces in this underwhelming sequel is to land a joke that adds anything to this ironically dry movie
Jan 24 2024,positive,it was way better then critics who are just being dinks rated this i enjoyed it and my daughter did too
Jan 24 2024,positive,i love both aquaman movies please more aquaman movies please
Jan 24 2024,positive,king orm is look different as hostage from metal slug and finally he eat a cockroach yuck
Jan 24 2024,positive,the movie dragged at the beginning there was one scene that i know was stolen from star wars the action scenes saved the movie and jason momoa was at his best fighting to save the world then the movie turned into an environmental message movie did we really need that in an action movie
Jan 24 2024,positive,great story line and very capable acting all around constant action towards an eventual ending saving atlantis and forming a bond with the surface world that was a long time coming managed to bring in the realworld crisis of climate change without making it the object of the film awesome jason keep on keepin on
Jan 24 2024,positive,me and my mom loves it we couldnt stop laughing and its definitely a feel good film with some action thrown in she even bought it
Jan 24 2024,positive,critics are useless i found it very entertaining
Jan 24 2024,positive,i love jason momoa in this movie he is funny   we took our grandchildren to see it it was better than i thought it was going to be
Jan 24 2024,negative,too scattered of a plot  felt like a teen movie  we left early
Jan 24 2024,positive,worth a watch but nowhere near as good as the first
Jan 23 2024,negative,didnt even make it through it was horrible jason momoa is mediocre and storyline was laughable
Jan 23 2024,positive,lots of fun and action  a little boring in parts
Jan 23 2024,positive,does what it says on the tin   fast fun entertainment takes its fantastical self not too seriously doesnt try too hard  and in the end not a bad cinema jolt  its an origin story sequel with a flabbier more world weary hero but then he pulls yet another worldsaver out of his adorably garish onesie and we get to keep our ice in our glasses and not turned to pondgoo thank you very much  the dialogue is atrociously predictable and the scene designs kitsch frankly you could watch this with eardefenders on and still get the gist also there are some nice chewy bits of actingrandall park flashes through brilliantly  as the nerdy microconsciencejiminy cricket belongs to the other megastudio folks  watch  enjoy but maybe dont save up for a permanent copy
Jan 23 2024,positive,good story line and lots of action stunts were great as well as the cgi
Jan 23 2024,negative,jason was good in it but the whole movie was a disaster
Jan 23 2024,positive,great visuals and very intriguing fight scenes worth every minute
Jan 23 2024,negative,the dynamic between momoa and wilson provides some charm but not enough to save this from being yet another generic cgifest with little more than flashy lights to offer
Jan 23 2024,negative,i prefer my movies to be entertaining not educating
Jan 23 2024,positive,aquaman is based chungus awesomesauce  jason momooa ius very fuunyny and heh he is really good actorrrrrrr  yes he isgood and all the characters have great motivastion an sheit  yea  1010 you base in butter and tomato sauce again
Jan 23 2024,positive,the second move was pretty good it had some twist and some turns and leaves some questions if they have a 3rd movie we will have some questions answered it was nice how they made some good changes and expanded aquaman character in the second movie
Jan 23 2024,positive,mehnot good but not bad either just meh
Jan 23 2024,positive,a really dumb film but entertaining as fuck better than the first but i do admit it seems like higher ups went in and cut out a lot william fe for is missed and dolph lungdren deserves more time still very entertaining
Jan 23 2024,positive,it had the same feel as the first one   id watch it again but it didnt bring anything new to the screen
Jan 23 2024,positive,i love this moive better than any other moives i saw this year love how they made aquaman a stronger character by using his family in the movie i feel that they should keep using this character shouldnt change the character i genuinely liked the first movie too it really connected to the second movie really well
Jan 23 2024,negative,reminiscent of how marvel took thor and turned him into a joke in love and thunder the attempts at comedy and aquamans goofiness dont work here either
Jan 22 2024,positive,despite what the critics say this movie is fantastic  seeing the brothers work together was wonderful  action packed
Jan 22 2024,negative,hot garbage step on a bee
Jan 22 2024,positive,while not as fresh and fun as the first it was still quite a fun ride
Jan 22 2024,negative,social influences have made movies like this and others completely suck
Jan 22 2024,neutral,its a fine enough ride but your gonna wish you could still ride the bigger better one overall i have grown up and love this universe no matter what people have said and what has happened when i think of on screen justice league this universe will always come first  510
Jan 22 2024,positive,just the right amount of cheesy and loads of action cgi was impressive
Jan 22 2024,negative,it was bad movie bad jokes boring scenes characters explaining everything before doing
Jan 22 2024,positive,i loved the movie definitely thought it was better than the first one hope they come out with a third one

Jan 22 2024,positive,solid dc movie i liked the action sequences
Jan 22 2024,positive,we preferred this movie over the first one most of the scenes are under water  which we thoroughly enjoyed of course jasons acting could be better but were not getting too technical here  it was a great watch and the entire family loved it
Jan 22 2024,positive,very good action movie
Jan 22 2024,positive,it was very good little bit of everything in it 
Jan 22 2024,positive,it was great  just enough  humor between the brothers
Jan 22 2024,negative,worse than the first and the first one was just passable this marks an end to the dc failure of a comic book universe 
Jan 22 2024,negative,almost walked out twice seen every marvel and dc film this one will be at or near the bottom of my super hero rankings list
Jan 22 2024,negative,the imagery was beautiful but handsdown probably one of the three worst dc movies ever made
Jan 22 2024,positive,great movie and theare
Jan 22 2024,positive,great movie entertaining easy to follow 
Jan 21 2024,negative,the movie was a disappointment with a bad villain redemption arc that had little character development and a bad build up to an easy defeat of a character
Jan 21 2024,positive,really a must see lovely plot and i can literally watch it again and againlovely show for the whole family
Jan 21 2024,positive,it was a really good movie great sequel to the first

Jan 21 2024,negative,so boring omfg jesus christ
Jan 21 2024,positive,this movie was awesome and had dinner good twist
Jan 21 2024,positive,a great movie for adults and older children even though the movie was just over 2 hours long it kept us gripped and in suspense for those who liked the first aguaman this one is much much more thrilling
Jan 21 2024,negative,worst movie ive seen in decades we left early
Jan 21 2024,negative,i mean it couldnt of gotten worse if i ran on the screen myself the action scenes were lackluster the plot what plot the cgi sucked lighting left so much to be desired
Jan 21 2024,positive,it was a little slow in the middle but other than that it was a great movie hope there is another
Jan 21 2024,negative,didnt get to watch it the theater went blank
Jan 21 2024,negative,absolutely terrible left 1 hr in i
Jan 21 2024,negative,they forgot about a decent story amongst all the forced climate change references
Jan 21 2024,positive,my son was enjoying the movie so much but didnt get to see the last 10 minutes due to a fire in the theatre everyone was evacuated    i hope the movie theatre does the right thing and gives him and his friends a voucher to see it or at least the ending 
Jan 20 2024,negative,storyline was weak saving the world from climate change really
Jan 20 2024,positive,the movie was good and funny the story was good and interesting the cast was brilliant its worth seeing 
Jan 20 2024,positive,it was really good the storyline is interesting in the end love conquers hate
Jan 20 2024,positive,it was a great movie and easy to follow
Jan 20 2024,positive,it was a pretty fun and very rollicking dc liveaction superhero movie it had pretty well done special effects really wondrous cinematography really astounding cast really phenomenal characters really amazing action very pleasant humor really impressive adventure really magnificent costumes really cool sets really awesome music and a very interesting story its not as good as the first aquaman movie but i really enjoyed it my other complaint is the runtime was a little bit too long i definitely recommend this movie to the fans of the first aquaman movie
Jan 20 2024,negative,awful movie not as fun and clever as the first very campy and boring disappointed
Jan 20 2024,positive,its tough to get excited about a superhero movie anymore but this one has good story points a good look and some fun capers it was a story i could buy into with some neat tieins to world events it was good fun
Jan 20 2024,neutral,other than a few lines this one wasnt a fun as most marvel movies they concentrated too much on the message
Jan 20 2024,negative,it feels a bit like beating a dead horse to even mention this one i expect the powers that be at dc or warner bros were so checked out by the time production began that this heap was always going to end up dead on arrival that being said aquaman and the lost kingdom is something of a masterclass in how to do everything wrong in a hollywood blockbuster and perhaps theres something interesting about observing it through that lens not for me personally i just wanted to toss in a little neutral positivity before i list off the limitless travesties of this picture    within the first 20 seconds the tawdry cgi work on a basic shipping vessel had me reeling the dialogue comes in about 15 seconds later and feels somehow even more jarring in its delivery its like the film was written by a fifth grader who skimmed over an aquaman wikipedia page and if the lazy writing wasnt bad enough the lazy acting really tanks whatever story they set out to tell any attempts at levity or severity throughout the movie come across as juvenile and illconceived    the design choices are absurd as well at one point aquaman gets an invisibility suit to break into a sand prison which by design is intended to avoid detection and hes almost instantly discovered anyway what is the intention here bizarre nonsequiturs muddy the already troubled waters of aquaman and the lost kingdom with confusing and unnecessary set dressing at one point they have the titular hero doing donuts on a motorcycle for no reason whatsoever smack dab in the middle of an expositional montage     and i can forgive a green flamed volcano which somehow flies under the global radar and the cyberpunk octopus and even the giant mutant grasshopper demons but at what point is enough enough it seems as though they ransacked some studio warehouse of unused props and set pieces and then worked them into the already fragmented script to save some money    character motivations are flimsy the plot devices are a chaotic clutter of overdone super hero tropes with far less depth or development than any of the films contemporaries or predecessors they borrow and butcher from so many other pop culture epics and yet somehow manage to miss the mark on every nod or reinterpretation you could almost treat it like a weak parody of the genre itself had that been its intention to begin with the 2 hour runtime is flooded with revolting regurgitations of the star wars prequels avatar and random scifi b movies they even have a fishpilled jabba the hutt scene actually a majority of aquaman and the lost kingdom plays like star wars as a high school production about fish and the people that love them     the soundtrack is erratic and only adds instability and poor pacing to many crucial scenes in the film this is particularly disappointing as so many comic book movie scores can and do successfully get away with dialing in their ominous slash tumultuous build up tracks and essentially just rinse and repeat until the credits roll im not saying i condone it but it wouldve been better than whatever happened here    the writing is bad the acting is bad the costuming is bad the action choreography is bad i am truly in awe of how much they got wrong with this one its like no one bothered to review any element of production or post production for that matter theres a scene where a central character is injured and the wound forms a hard geometric line on her neck thats biologically impossible and visually obvious its actually astounding to me that something this sloppy could be overlooked or dismissed in a project of this scale and the film is littered with so many amateur mistakes like this one i can only speculate that at some point the call came in about the dceu reboot and everyone decided to lame duck their way through it all    i wish i could say there was even one redeemable quality in this 200 million dollar budget endeavor i can look past poor execution if the intention is somewhat interesting but i cant even say there was any intention or plan in this narrative to begin with beyond that i am appalled at how projects like this speak to the state of the industry as a whole    aquaman and the lost kingdom is certainly a strong argument in support of dismantling the franchise as it stands but maybe more so an argument against returning to the form at all
Jan 20 2024,positive,while it was always going to be a disappointment since it was a standalone film that was ending a universe aquaman and the lost kingdom is a funny and heartfelt film with a good message about family the cgi is also pretty good to mixed depending on the scene especially when compared to one of dcs earlier offerings of the year the flash which had some of the worst cgi id seen in a superhero movie though it did get a bit boring for me near the middle and i wasnt a huge fan of how it ended i would say that this film is a good time to watch especially with your family
Jan 20 2024,positive,good action packed movie the picture and all the animated colors  beautiful underground cities the craftsmanship of the creature great creativity and music put into this movie one thing i thought the baby should have been involved more with his powers or leave it hanging to look forward to another movie with the baby
Jan 20 2024,positive,loved it so entertaining 
Jan 19 2024,negative,the cgi was garbage lol 
Jan 19 2024,positive,these was amazening i love the images the locationsof were the movies was recorded i loved it and i would watch again
Jan 19 2024,negative,not good at all the charm is gone i still like momoa but his character is a caricature of his former self this movie is too kidfriendly too unfunny and has pretty bad cgi compared to some movies 510 years older no wonder it only made a fraction at the box office compared to the predecessor dc cinematic universe is a hot mess it was very hard to focus and finish watching it
Jan 19 2024,positive,it was such a great movie
Jan 18 2024,positive,stunned that his trident was able to break the other trident so easily but kept attention thoroughly throughout
Jan 18 2024,positive,entertaining sequel to the first awesome origin movie of aquaman hope they make a 3rd one
Jan 18 2024,positive,i had a fun time the movie has a lot of flaws and i mean a lot of flaws but its pretty fun

Jan 17 2024,neutral,3d was good but the storyline was a bit dull and obvious good action
Jan 17 2024,positive,great special effects simple story with not not much substance to it a suspenseful action packed movie from beginning to the end
Jan 16 2024,positive,its a standard popcorn movie its acceptable but not epical
Jan 16 2024,positive,good action decent plot  i like jason mamoa and patrick wilson
Jan 16 2024,positive,the the visuals were stunning an amazing under water world this mermans story line is interesting the family values highlighted in the story motivated heroes and villains family loyalty was stressed as a strength and a weakness i enjoyed this movie the story was interesting and the characters held up the brother dynamic was spot on  i will watch it again and again
Jan 16 2024,positive,loved it  full of action  great for adults and school aged kids too
Jan 16 2024,positive,incredible production characters i loved the definition and quality of the film i think that in the medium and long term it could be very well received by the public or the audience in general the music selected highlighted the role of the characters and this type of cinematic design is incredible
Jan 16 2024,negative,it is high time that jason had a more serious role of his own hes shown that he can handle it and he would be popular in just about anything except for a sequel to aquaman the sequel wasnt needed especially given theres no good content being put out right now this is a gutterball
Jan 16 2024,positive,the dialog and comedy was great well written
Jan 16 2024,positive,i think this movie was better than anticipated with the theme being really cool and a awesome villianbut my only concerns are that the fights seemed kind of repetitive  for example the fight starts with some cool visuals and stuff but in the end the hero is about to lose then someone comes in last minute to save thembut other than that it exceeded my expectations but not enough for 5 stars
Jan 16 2024,positive,lots of action and the graphics are fantastic its a must see movie
Jan 16 2024,positive,i thought the movie was very good and was a lot of fun 
Jan 16 2024,positive,it always tickles me to see a movie with such a divide between the critics rating and the audience rating  it was a good time and thats what matters in the end  this is a movie its not a film
Jan 16 2024,positive,it was great  a lot of people was shittin on the movie but they said the test screenings of flash were good but the movie was bad  all i know is dont believe anybodys opinion go check it out for yourself

Jan 16 2024,positive,should of been a to be continued movie
Jan 16 2024,positive,i liked the movie a lot  having a particular like for 3d movies i find that theater 3d compared to home 3d is like turning the depth down and surprisingly the concept of being immersive by getting people to believe that you can only enjoy 3d if the viewing screen was wall to wall is arguably a concept that i provided many friends with an enjoyable experience with a 70 screen
Jan 15 2024,positive,i enjoyed the movie and the story i look forward to the next episode of aquaman
Jan 15 2024,positive,this movie is great with actionthe critics do not know movies

Jan 15 2024,positive,the movie dragged in places and felt like a slow starter it was of course beautiful in terms of the cgi i took two of my grandchildren and they also got bored in places but were able to stick with it through the end
Jan 15 2024,negative,all i can say is fck warner execs and fck james gunn you guys destroyed a good film and a potentially great universe just to compete with marvel which by the way is flopping hard too    this film will go down in history as the worst ending to an interconnected universe    i feel bad for james wan they destroyed his baby
Jan 15 2024,negative,it was honestly just so bad thank goodness i went to a double feature at a drivein i wasnt expecting it to be good and that makes it worse it still disappointed me
Jan 15 2024,positive,this movie is very interesting and its ending is unexpected
Jan 15 2024,positive,loved it very entertaining the graphics and special effects were amazing the action the humor the characters everything
Jan 15 2024,positive,this was a vary good action packed movie in theaters the only thing they couldve done better is backstory but if you watched the first one you should be caught up
Jan 15 2024,positive,it was a fun action packed movie  my 11 year old enjoyed it ad was not disappointed
Jan 15 2024,positive,this man is an good actor   i loved the film

Jan 15 2024,positive,its not great but not bad either  its like most of the rest dcu films
Jan 15 2024,positive,i liked the movie its fun it has action excellent effects and jason momoa integrated his personality into his aquaman character  i am a big fan of superhero movies and the justice league characters and i am not disappointed at all i love jason momoa as aquaman i would definitely watch him again
Jan 15 2024,positive,mamoa horrible actor but plot wasnt as bad as people said
Jan 15 2024,positive,fun movie to watch love the visual effect and the happy ending

Jan 15 2024,positive,ajson mamoa was as likeable as ever but the story line was weak  unoriginal would have enjoyed more sea life
Jan 15 2024,positive,great movie with some of everything comedy danger violence romance conflict and love the focus was mostly on the relationship between aquaman and his brother which was pivotal the cgi was very well done all in all a great 2 hour distraction
Jan 14 2024,positive,looked good visually but the storyline was so simple didnt seem worth it
Jan 14 2024,positive,loved it  wish there would be a 3rd

Jan 14 2024,positive,the best movie this is perfect

Jan 14 2024,positive,i really dont get what the bad press is on this is  this movie was great  great special effects and artistry and jason mamoas sense of humor carries it through  great popcorn entertainment  just enjoy movies in the moment remember to be a child again and youll love it
Jan 14 2024,positive,it was okay could have been better  the action was little messy the plot not great  like the chemistry between aquaman and orm  good to see the old cast back for final time
Jan 14 2024,positive,great visuals and nice ending to a great villain atlas brother was done wrong and he should have been the villain for 3
Jan 14 2024,positive,good movie although it could have been a super movie but it is watchable and has a pleasant time
Jan 14 2024,positive,sometimes critics dont speak for everybody in my opinion this movie was great and worth watching no matter what age you are its was very entertaining but be prepared for a lot of cgi which i dont mind given the fact this is meant to take place undersea
Jan 14 2024,positive,great movie in my opinion the story line matches up perfectly
Jan 14 2024,positive,it was a really good entertaining movie sad that i was the only person in the theater when i saw it
Jan 14 2024,positive,the fight scene with king poseidons brother was too easy
Jan 14 2024,positive,i enjoyed the movie full of action comedy and jason mamoa what else can you ask for
Jan 14 2024,positive,great action some funny moments and amazing fx
Jan 13 2024,positive,aquaman and the lost kingdom trails perfectly from the setup of the original and combined with impressive fight scenes and cgi it provides a sensational sequel
Jan 13 2024,positive,i really enjoyed it and the cinematography was absolutely stunning great cast enjoyable musical score as well
Jan 13 2024,negative,i love jason and the relationship with his on screen brother was the best part otherwise it was dull corny predictable if you feel you must see it dont pay to see it in a theater wait for it on cable it wont take long
Jan 13 2024,neutral,it was a bit long some of the cg could have been better there were times when i didnt know if  aqumans brother was cg or not
Jan 13 2024,negative,the ending could of been better disappointed but it probably would of been different if james gunn didnt take over as the whole dc reset
Jan 13 2024,positive,i waited so long to see this because reviews were so mixed my expectations were low so i cant say i was disappointed  my favorite parts were aquaman bantering with his brother jason mamoa commits to this character  but overall most of the movie is weak  the dialog was the worst  in all the underwater scenes it sounded so unnatural and obviously none of the characters were in tbe room together recording
Jan 13 2024,positive,it was a really good movie
Jan 13 2024,positive,loved it for a sequel it was as good as the first one which doesnt usually happen for me i cant wait for it to release at home to watch it again i dont want to spoil it so i wont say too much but the brother returning was perfect    i do wish they added more of mera in there they kept cutting her out of scenes where she could have been held in longer i know people dont like the actress personal life but i loved her as an actress in this movie and was disappointed they didnt include her more
Jan 13 2024,positive,it was excellent i like it more then the first i just wish the final fight was more epic

Jan 12 2024,positive,this is good to see on weekends with family
Jan 12 2024,negative,dull dull dull too comical with a weak plot
Jan 12 2024,negative, propagandaman and the lost conspiracy    there were a lot of hidden messages to this movie from man made climate change to eating bugs difference is atlantis isnt going to come and give everyone all ev cars to save the world  pun intended but hey at least they painted a message in this movie anyway i didnt deduct marks for that if i did the movie would get 1 out of 5 but this movie got low ratings because of the predictable cliche and even given the action and effects its nothing to be attuned to for thrills if you just like to crash onto the couch and watch something casual to pass the time while you wait for your wife at your monsters in laws house this movie is a life saver but its one of those maximumexplosionmaximumsfx movies in the hopes that they can compensate for the lack of the story backbone only grace i gave this movie was the emotional bond between the two brothers who put aside their differences to defeat the evil power villain in the end only to be disappointed to find out that the evil powerful villain was a level 1 peon that only had 1 minute screen time end the end   so meh   and remember folks eatz ze bugz  subliminal after the credits
Jan 12 2024,negative,12 drunk muscular surfer king saves the world from global warming zombies
Jan 12 2024,positive,aquaman is a great film light funny and fast jason momoa is the best actor for this character your performance is magnificent its worth watching

Jan 11 2024,negative,i wanted to kill myself i wish i could get those two hours back it looked cool but 20 minutes felt like 7 years i want to die now
Jan 11 2024,positive,one and this one is a good  movie 
Jan 11 2024,positive,so disappointed  loved the first movie but this was boring
Jan 11 2024,positive,it was good for what it was a fantasy movie special effects were pretty good acting was decent jason mamoa is a joy to watch it was an entertaining movie
Jan 11 2024,positive,movie was not as laughably bad as i thought it might be good action  half decent cgi  some cool water punk tec held my attention however an anticlimactic final showdown plot holes a shameless lazy copy and paste of jabba the huts palace  multiple cringe product placement hold the movie back from its true potential 6410
Jan 11 2024,positive,muy buena súper chevere
Jan 11 2024,positive,i love it its better than the first one 
Jan 11 2024,positive,it wasnt badit wasnt great favorite part of the move was the octopus
Jan 11 2024,positive,it was action packed  had a good storyline i think a few parts were dragged out but overall it was a good movie
Jan 11 2024,negative,long drawn out not enough to keep interest
Jan 11 2024,positive,was a good movie plot with good amount action and choreography and decent cg
Jan 11 2024,positive,well done fun and entertaining movie just what youd hope for for this movie
Jan 11 2024,positive,i loved it thought it was awesome and even better than expected they did a fantastic job and cant wait for a follow up movie to it great job
Jan 11 2024,positive,lots of action great special effect and not a bad storyline
Jan 11 2024,positive,overall pretty good movie the dialogue could have been better but jason m made up for it with good humor
Jan 11 2024,positive,very good move go see it
Jan 10 2024,positive,a film about brotherhood    if you lead atlantis will follow  the exiled brother of aquaman
Jan 10 2024,positive,the movie was picked up perfectly where the last aquaman left off
Jan 10 2024,negative,it was really goofy and dumb i could probably only recommend this to die hard aqua man fans
Jan 10 2024,positive,i enjoyed it very much   good job on the sequel
Jan 10 2024,positive,this was a great movie far superior to the first aquaman
Jan 10 2024,negative,momoa gives it his all but this movie is a dead end to a defunct universe of films the premise with orm is fine but everything else is meaningless the villain is underdeveloped and the story is utterly stupid clearly half of this movie was reshot or cut a dozen times which makes it incoherent at times not as bad as other superhero failures in 2023 but another waste of 200m for sure
Jan 10 2024,positive,the movie was very entertaining and the visual effects were awesome
Jan 10 2024,negative,generic moviegeneric film story without depth totally disappointing
Jan 10 2024,negative,jason is a terrible actor bad jokes bad movie at all dont see it
Jan 10 2024,positive,entertaining and fun to watch on the big screen
Jan 10 2024,negative,the first 40 minutes is a long trudge of cgi nonsense some of the worst dialogue happens during this time and some serious overacting by whoever the captain lady is of the enemy ship however if you can make it through that it does get better    aquaman hunts down his brother for a teamup and we spend a lot less time watching dizzying cgi under water battles and more time going on an adventure with two funny dudes its a great time watching them interact and work together and thats the highlight of this movie also how is patrick wilson that ripped after his shirtless seen i stopped shoving popcorn down the gullet for a short time
Jan 10 2024,positive,why is the reviewers rating 35  makes no sense i thought this was a really good movie  i saw the marvels which got a relatively low 60 and this movie is way better than the marvels  there were definitely some goofy scenes but so did the first one  this one really centered more on family and i think it worked relatively well  i was so apprehensive going to watch this and it really pleasantly surprised me and i enjoyed it to the end  the dynamics between orem and aquaman was sometimes a bit forced but it worked okay  yea i can see the audience rating of over 80 as the correct rating and the 35 reviewers rating as fishy to say the least
Jan 10 2024,negative,horrible all the way around 
Jan 10 2024,positive,shouldve been more action  1010
Jan 10 2024,positive,it was entertaining better than i thought it would be as i didnt see the first one
Jan 10 2024,negative,it was right up there with going to the proctologist  stop with all the shitty cgi
Jan 10 2024,negative,boring almost fell asleep 10 minutes in
Jan 10 2024,positive,really enjoyed it found that this movie is better written than the first the story connects and the lines are great
Jan 10 2024,positive,enjoy the sense of humor between
Jan 10 2024,positive,it was a fun filled and serious movie  i loved that he kept it to the jason momoa we love  great movie
Jan 10 2024,positive,this is my first movie review of the year 2024 and i am just now realizing i do not have to make an entire paragraph of how i enjoyed a film this was an epic movie you should definitely go see it if you have seen the first one
Jan 10 2024,negative,colorful but dialogue and scenes were hijacked from a number of different adventure movies  star wars jurassic park mandalorian spiderman guardians of the galaxy just to name a few
Jan 9 2024,positive,great on the edge of my seat action jason got my full attention in every scene so i was not disappointed   but what a huge miss with the message they were sending regarding global warming  aquaman drools over eating burgers and the end bonus scene is truly disturbing   livestock production have some of the largest water footprints of agriculture  taking nearly 1800 gallons of water to produce one pound of beef  and livestock are responsible for over 14 of global greenhouse gasses      so jason do some of your own saving the world  you sent the wrong message in this film
Jan 9 2024,negative,terrible script it hurt to watch actors try to make it through
Jan 9 2024,positive,i had  an absolute blast watching this movie i loved the pacing of it it moved along quickly but not too fast great action great comedy and a good message and story definite must watch
Jan 9 2024,positive,a real fun movie  and funny too great humor mixed with exciting action   if you want to see a movie that flies by with a good story this is it
Jan 9 2024,positive,this movie was a fun follow up to the original  dc hurt itself by not promoting their best movie of the year
Jan 9 2024,negative,a weaker follow up to a weak initial entry  the dceu ends not with a triumph but with a final desperate last gasp for air
Jan 9 2024,positive,actually better than the first in my opinion but still just ok
Jan 9 2024,positive,i loved the storyline and the graphics  it was an all around good movie
Jan 9 2024,positive,its a ok film but its takes time to get into it
Jan 9 2024,positive,i really enjoyed aquaman and the lost kingdom this film is a lot of fun with great action scenes and some of the best sonic sound production going around sure it gets a bit cheesy at times but its based on a comic book i found the film to be highly entertaining well worth seeing on the big screen
Jan 9 2024,positive,i got a friend request we talked for a few hours and when i found out he was a fraud i ignored all his messages i honestly wouldnt have suspected him if not for the exposure of a professional hacker whom i hired after realizing my bitcoin wallet had been emptied i sincerely dont know how or why these fraudsters operate and if they know the pain and trauma they cause in the lives of their victims when i found my wallet had been emptied i nearly had a cardiac arrest i am a 58yearold taxi driver and i need money now more than ever i resolved to find ways to recover the stolen money and thats when i found cyber genie recovery expert these guys used their wild tech skills to help me trace and recover all that was stolen from me within a short period i hired them i was really patient and understanding with them because after a few sessions i began to have my doubts during these trial moments cyber genies team was very persuasive and encouraging i am glad my doubts and fears never won because the recovery was a success at last all hopes lost were restored stolen money recovered and created a lifetime relationship with cyber genies team   cybergenieatcyberservicesdotc0m  wha sapp 12525120391  telegram cybergeniehackpro
Jan 9 2024,negative,movie style 2011 green lantern on crack
Jan 9 2024,positive,fun and action packed  unique multifunctional modes of transportation and cool ice sculptures
Jan 9 2024,positive,jason momoas humor and the imagery and effects were awesome
Jan 9 2024,positive,i thought it was a pretty good movie it wasnt the best but i enjoyed it i thought the cgi was pretty good but we need a good guy to die overall kinda good would recommend to a dc fan in which i am not really a fan of
Jan 8 2024,positive,love the movie and the action it gave
Jan 8 2024,negative,this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen its juvenile predictable and oh so cringey i wanted to walk out of the theater pretty quickly unfortunately i had nothing to do today so i sat through this garbage to the end
Jan 8 2024,positive,first one was better still really enjoyed this one
Jan 8 2024,positive,great moviethe theater was just extremely cold
Jan 8 2024,negative,dialog felt like it was written as a project by a 6th grade drama class cgi was terrible and story was incoherent but on the upside the acting was horrible and stilted worst movie i have seen in decades and i love most all movies they should not have released this movie people keep going thinking is must not really be that bad its aquaman yeah it is that bad
Jan 8 2024,negative,a disappointing end to the dceu jason momoas aquaman started out so well in his introduction back in the justice league but this movie turned him into a goofy thor knockoff the movie itself felt like a disjointed mess that went through massive changes during post production and stuck together with bandaids
Jan 8 2024,positive,great watch dont believe the critics
Jan 8 2024,positive,we loved the comedy and puns graphics were amazing and loved the story line all in all a great film
Jan 8 2024,positive,it seemed to be long but i liked how aquaman reconciled with his brother
Jan 8 2024,positive,love the series had lots of fun watching it with my daughters
Jan 8 2024,positive,i thought it was really good are the critics always give movies a bad score but look at the score of 81 of people that actually paid to see it we dont listen to the critics anymore we think for ourselves have a good day go see aquaman 2
Jan 8 2024,positive,another fantastic dc movie of the defender of the ocean lots of action and comedy i recommend it watching the movie
Jan 8 2024,positive,this movie had me on the edge of my seat the whole time the ending was absolutely worth it i would say you dont necessarily need to watch the first one to understand but it would definitely help and clear things up as to why things are happening now one of my top movies and that says a lot because i watch a lot
Jan 8 2024,positive,everything is great from acting the scenes this film immerses me in the world of the ocean i like the way athur and orm sticks together fight with acient creatures the only one make me feel regret is that i dont know if i will able to see these characters on the screens again this is still not the end of dceu not yet
Jan 8 2024,positive,i think this movie was fun to watch and had alot of different things in thos one that the first movie didnt some a like some i didnt like one of the things i liked abt the movie was the brothers working together that was some funny moments with then the thing that i hated didnt really like abt it is there wasnt alot of water action and the final battle is kinda weak from the first movie if they did it like that again but a little bit less than the first i would of been fine but all it felt like was every superhero movie just a fight
Jan 8 2024,positive,omg i loved it the action was great the special effects and sounds were phenomenal i loved the storyline and that they didnt have aquaman just beat up all his enemies they allowed him to get bruised up a bit before really flexing his muscles
Jan 8 2024,positive,great movie great graphics loved it

Jan 7 2024,positive,stunning visual underwater effects than part one jason acting is perfect but not with the lead lady could be more touching if the film brings back the professor from death or giving lead lady the death scene overall like indiana jones series with the bug gag dont forget to watch king orm end credit after movie
Jan 7 2024,positive,this movie is almost a throw back to a buddy cop type of movie it is funny good action sequences and allows for mr momao to put his signature style to the character one last time

Jan 7 2024,neutral,just as the rating say meh it passed the time
Jan 7 2024,neutral,it got off to a slow start but built pace as the movie went along the film was very visually pleasing and included some great fighting sequences i felt that the story could have used some more development and that it ended abruptly overall it is a fitting end to the dceu as it had the capabilities of being an excellent film but was ultimately just mediocre and left me feeling unresolved
Jan 7 2024,negative,acting wasnt the problem story wasnt the problem it appears they didnt have the budget for cgi and it just kills the story when its that bad its losing the points for the cgi it had potential but it let down the cast with 90s grade cgi hate to call it the green lantern of aquaman movies because that was a great cast but this feels like that watching that at times the cast and story almost save it from that level but its a struggle to watch wont watch again please do dc some justice with the talented actors you have casted and i will check the next one but this brand is on thin ice with me personally

Jan 7 2024,positive,it was the best movie i ever have i enjoyed it
Jan 7 2024,positive,was a good movie overall couple scenes were reminiscent of a few classic scifi films in the past with use of similar scene scenarios which were kinda cool story line managed to stay relevant to aquaman theme had a bit of humor here and there with mamoa being just as good this time as the past aguaman movies will go to the next one if there is one
Jan 7 2024,negative,dumb fing movie didnt care about any of the characters not even the baby

Jan 6 2024,positive,it was a fun and action packed movie it had a great message and was entertaining the whole time
Jan 6 2024,positive,much as arthur has learnt the novelty of being king wears off a degree of creative weariness is visible in aquaman and the lost kingdom
Jan 6 2024,positive,i am not a fan of movies like this one i took my 9 year old grandson i was surprised better than i thought special effects were really good
Jan 6 2024,positive,fun and a great end to the dceu
Jan 6 2024,positive,i found this movie to be a pretty great addition to the superhero movie world i actually might like it a bit better than the first movie i thought the story was a good one and the subplots were pretty well fleshed out i also think the special effects were superior to the 2018 installment overall a pretty good movie
Jan 6 2024,negative,the writing costumes and acting were all pretty bad
Jan 6 2024,positive,im a dc girl by far christopher reeve won me for life i guess with the first superman this movie wasnt too bad i would suggest watching the first aquaman first that was the major down part the producers expected everyone to have the first movie on the forefront of everyones thoughts i kept thinking wait the brother was in the first movie did they not realize a thousand super movies have been out since the last aquaman regardless i thought it was not as good as ww better than ww84 loved the heart jason momoa brought
Jan 6 2024,positive,fun and entertaining
Jan 6 2024,positive,jason momoa the movie was awesome special effects were amazing and i cant wait for the next one

Jan 6 2024,positive,great actors and special effects
Jan 6 2024,neutral,the  cgi scenery was fantastic  storyline was average and was overly slanted to more environmental doomsday hysteria
Jan 6 2024,positive,like john carter and green lantern before it this is a dc film that might be pummelled by the some critics but is going to be classed as an underrated gem by true fans of the dc universe
Jan 6 2024,negative,this movie is very predictable oh no a main character lays under a sword what will happen someone saves them last second  happend twice in a single scene  additionally the main villain was alive for less than a minute very forgettable movie good cgi tho
Jan 6 2024,positive,excellent movie highly recommend go see
Jan 6 2024,negative,hollywood thinks viewers have no brain and will not notice how bad this movie is but we are not that dumb we saw that this movie had no passion no love and even the actors felt unmotivated as the final movie of the dceu ive expected it to be much better
Jan 6 2024,positive,the movie was a fun blast with some great cgi and some poor cgi ps5 style jason proves he is a great leading manbut the writing was lack lustre and down right cheese festalthough ithought gimli from lord of the rings had lost his movie set all in all a good sit on the couch movie with a few beers 
Jan 6 2024,positive,it had a lot of action and it kept my attention the entire time
Jan 6 2024,negative,should have watched the color purpleit was that bad
Jan 6 2024,positive,i dont know what these critics are talking aboutthis movie was fun sleek and action packed the whole way through im a big movie fan so my expectations are high aquaman was a win
Jan 6 2024,positive,really enjoyed it nowhere near as bad as critics say but i guess i am a fan one thing i will say though is that some of the cgi a bit questionable especially considering the budget but overall a fun popcorn superhero flick
Jan 6 2024,positive,great movie went in with low expectations in dc list but was happy to see a good movie love the brother theme all through driving the movie to stay on point  clean movie well stitched humor along the way

Jan 6 2024,positive,i had no expectation going in i was pleasantly surprise it wasnt terrible
Jan 6 2024,positive,not as good as the first one a good fantasy action film not as serious as an avengers movie and the dialogue a bit simple but a fun evening
Jan 6 2024,positive,i give it a 65 because it was good but really bad the theatrics and comedy were there but acting and writing lacked substance could have done with better dramatic acting rather than just jokes
Jan 6 2024,positive,this was a good movie i would recommend it
Jan 6 2024,positive,had a good story line and great special effects  the movie keep moving a long
Jan 6 2024,positive,i think people expect too much out of these movies anymore they expect them to be beyond their wildest expectations every single time i think this movie was on point the story was good the acting was good the special effects were off the charts i loved it
Jan 6 2024,positive,it was actually better than i thought it would be enjoyed it and will watch it again once it is streaming
Jan 6 2024,positive,excellent movie aquaman dazzles with its deepsea adventure and stunning visuals directed masterfully by james wan jason momoas portrayal of arthur curry brings a refreshing depth to the superhero genre blending action with a heartfelt family dynamic the film excels in its engaging story and standout cast making it a memorable addition to the superhero cinema landscape  cant wait for aquamans 3

Jan 5 2024,positive,it had its slow moments but we have already seen it twice with dofferent groups of people and we loved it
Jan 5 2024,negative,ridiculous and not in any good way  i really enjoyed zack synders dceu and its a real shame that this is how it all ends  i was not much a fan of the first aquaman but boy does this sequel crush it all to the bottom of the barrel  this is the end of what started with the great man of steel and its a shame  at least we have snyders justice league cut which is amazing you know skip this and go watch that instead
Jan 5 2024,positive,loved jason m as aquaman in great shape nicole was fabulous the undersea world was incredible along with the atlantis court should watch other pequails to understand plot

Jan 5 2024,positive,loved the movie more action new characters and funnier than the first

Jan 5 2024,positive,entertaining than the 1st sequel
Jan 5 2024,positive,pretty good movie really liked the first one better end definitely could have had a better finish but i would walk out if i didnt like it
Jan 5 2024,positive,had to see it again
Jan 5 2024,neutral,the plot was garbage most of the high quality actors had almost no scenes and the villain was the sameworse than before the motivation for the henchmen was glossed over entirelyabsurd and the mcguffin child at the end was groan inducing mamoa and wilson did fine as the awkward buddy comedy duo but it was hard to take them seriously at times     on top of the sloppy writing we really didnt get anything new its the same basic plot revenge  getting involved with the surface meets environmental crises as the first movie with very little of its charm and joy
Jan 5 2024,negative,this movie is bad
Jan 5 2024,negative,the movie was unoriginal and lacked humor
Jan 5 2024,positive,a very good movie for the whole family some parts remind me of a avatar

Jan 4 2024,positive,actionpacked with some humor ripped physiqueseye candy
Jan 4 2024,positive,great sequel tons of action beautiful visuals especially in 3d must watch
Jan 4 2024,positive,very exciting and action packed  great plot line
Jan 4 2024,positive,just got back from seeing in this and it was a really good watch the only issue is that the movie was never designed to be the finale of the dceu was the movie on that level doesnt deliver but it is a really solid movie that has a good story solid villain and a nice redemption for aquamans brother and although it doesnt give a satisfying conclusion to the dceu i do think its a really good sendoff for jason momoa time as the character
Jan 4 2024,positive,i love jason momoa and thats all i want to say
Jan 4 2024,negative,absolute shte theres not a shred of originality  they have their equivalent of the star wars bar and singers the pirate king aka jabba the hut walking spindly things like war of the worlds plus others little to no character development and completely dominated by yawn yawn really seen it all before special effects boring boring boring oh and momoas triceps look utterly ridiculous with padding in his gold suit dont waste your time or money
Jan 4 2024,positive,critics are too quick to throw down this is a delightful action flick with comedic lines as they once were delivered the dynamic cast is engaging and fun the family theme is focal and environmental undertones are felt throughout enjoyable above all else
Jan 4 2024,positive,just love how it was a family kind of theme and movie its good for all ages and its a good movie
Jan 4 2024,positive,even better than the first one loved it
Jan 4 2024,positive,not to realistic but had a lot of action
Jan 4 2024,positive,read reviews and expected it to be bad wasnt so bad after all and i consider it a positive entry in the otherwise superhero fatigue phase both studios are currently suffering from
Jan 4 2024,positive,it was meh seems like they didnt have a good structure to the movie choppy and unexplained parts everywhere story line fell  flat on areas that should have had more dialogue between scenes jason mamoa is also given too much freedom in how he wants to portray the character which i understand can be a good thing but he made it annoying wouldnt recommend it as a theatre movie its more of a wait until it comes out so when you get up to do something and forget its even on you wont feel like you lost too much 
Jan 4 2024,positive,the movie was fun and ran at neckbreaking speed like the first one action scenes were ok although the first movie had way more action scenes than this one but the dynamic between the 2 brothers was really entertaining    overall the story itself was not that great and the first movie was more entertaining than this but it was still enjoyable
Jan 4 2024,positive,i saw 5 young teenies all walk out after 15 minutes which was a little shocking  i really enjoyed and other people that have a bit longer attention span  as i get older i am seeing that movies are moving from the boomers  gen x to the millenials  alphas hoping these well made movies can keep the younger generation as well
Jan 4 2024,positive,great film and heart in it as well the brotherly bond and such of course the end of the dceu but a good note to leave on at least
Jan 4 2024,positive,action through the whole movie
Jan 4 2024,positive,i really like the movie i dont understand why critics are so hatters the movie its really good i really enjoyedi recommend it 
Jan 4 2024,negative,early in the movie arthur is playing with action figures to describe a fight with pirates to his infant son the rest of the movie feels like watching a toddler smash his super powers toys together while making explosion sounds with his mouth
Jan 4 2024,negative,how much do positive reviews on rt cost asking for a friend in hollywood 
Jan 4 2024,negative,me and my wife literally laughed and left the theatre after sitting through a mere hour of this mess mamoas tough guy acting was terrible compared to the first it was a cheap underwater star wars  pirates of the caribbean wannabe pile of garbage
Jan 4 2024,negative,its the first time i was praying for the movie to end
Jan 4 2024,positive,it was good it was just your regular good action film its worth a watch  at least at home when its on streaming 
Jan 4 2024,positive,i liked the moral of the movie and graphics  jason momoa was perfect for the role in which he added humor to his character
Jan 4 2024,negative,most horrible movie ive watched in years all cgi and mediocre storyline save your money and skip it
Jan 4 2024,positive,the movie had a lot of actionlaughs and surprisesit was very long yet highly funny  i like to actors and the jason m  i would recommend the movies to friends
Jan 4 2024,positive,awesome action filled film
Jan 4 2024,positive,the story line could have been much better like the first movie since the director also directed john wick he used too much fighting and not enough dialogue
Jan 4 2024,positive,jason momoa is the goat
Jan 4 2024,positive,great special effects
Jan 4 2024,negative,this is just not any good  and aquaman got fat
Jan 4 2024,positive,my friends and i did not care about ratings went to see this film today  a bit of a slow start but really picked up  the strength and best part of this film was the brothers together and the ending was perfect  lifted my spirts this day thank you to whomever
Jan 3 2024,neutral,theater sound volume to loud my spouse had to take out her hearing aids due to be to loud even without hearing aids  movie was fine
Jan 3 2024,negative,i got bored with all of the fight scenes
Jan 3 2024,negative,weak premise and poor story telling parts of it just ridiculously predictable i hate when they cancel movies but this one wouldve been a blessing if it had been left in shreds on the editing room floor
Jan 3 2024,positive,loved it as always
Jan 3 2024,negative,while visually stunning found the movie to drag a bit and found myself getting distracted storyline was bland and boring other than the visual effects and cgi action this movie is merely a movie i wouldnt recommend paying money for more like a late night watch when nothing else to do
Jan 3 2024,positive,im so glad i am not a movie critic because the majority of them cant seem to have fun its a tough job because at one point they mustve had fun watching movies but now its just a job im not saying they need to love every movie but they seem to use the same criteria to review every movie and thats not the way to do it at least for me to each their own but aquaman and the lost kingdom is a blast momoa and wilson have fantastic chemistry
Jan 3 2024,positive,started out kind of slow and technical but then turned out fantastic
Jan 3 2024,negative,hard to recommend a bit of a cgi fest overall without many redeeming qualities
Jan 3 2024,negative,thank god that this version of the dceu is over  this is possibly one of the worst films i have ever watched  and the fact that is cost more than 300million to make  the acting was pathetic  the script was nonsensible if hollywood doesnt get a grip soon then products like this are going to end the industry 
Jan 3 2024,positive,loved it i will see anything jason momoa is in
Jan 3 2024,negative,this is such a stupid movie what a waste of time lame they seriously put no work or effort into this dumb movie rolling eyes writers need to work harder ruined aquaman for me and i was a serious aquaman fan ugh
Jan 3 2024,positive,great movie i think better than the first one
Jan 3 2024,positive,plot was amazing very funny acting was great overall i really enjoyed this movie and thought it was amazing looking forward to maybe a 3rd one
Jan 3 2024,positive,me and my friend went to go see this movie in 3d it was one of the best dc movies ive ever watched in my life dc is definitely stepping up their game definitely a must watch movie especially if you can watch in 3d
Jan 3 2024,positive,the critics are wrong  i was so pleasantly surprised by aquaman  the lost kingdom because i had low expectations due to the low critics score  atlk has a lot of laughs some good action and moments that reminded me of star wars or lord of the rings  more than a superhero movie  randall park was an awesome addition as well  i had a great time at this flick
Jan 3 2024,negative,way over the top cgi bro dude mamoa with his bad acting range and a storyline weve seen a zillion times before not a surprise its going to lose many millions of dollars
Jan 3 2024,positive,it was funny great cast except for 1 actress
Jan 3 2024,neutral,nothing new here  just another movie that tries to steal the bar scene from star wars i was bored half way through see it if you have nothing better to do
Jan 3 2024,positive,a great visual feast in imax  filled with rich and creative environments  i loved the story and adventure of aquaman and his brother  the balance of humor and action was done well overall a little heavy in some parts  the story was good and the threats felt real  overall a fun time at the theater
Jan 3 2024,negative,wasnt blown away by this one alot of aspects of the story seem rushed jasons amazing when the roll fits i just feel this role has never been right with him doing it that takes nothing away from his abilities just a personal viewpoint
Jan 3 2024,positive,it wasnt the best dc superhero movie and it also wasnt the worst
Jan 3 2024,positive,the visuals were nice story and writing not so much
Jan 3 2024,positive,better than the 1st movie lots of funny oneliners and the storyline flows well definitely recommend
Jan 3 2024,negative,great acting from the actors  pathetic writing seriously global warming you idiots  get new writers
Jan 3 2024,neutral,the technology was cool the story line was awful and the bad guy was easily defeated with one attack    save your money and torrent it
Jan 3 2024,negative,honestly its so cheese  not worth it

Jan 3 2024,positive,i love jason momoa and i loved the baby and the story
Jan 3 2024,positive,i love dc films this movie is highly worth watching
Jan 3 2024,negative,seriously one of the worst movies ive ever seen just a fitting end to the embarrassment that was the dceu terrible plot poorly edited and when momoa has to really act it is blatantly obvious he cannot watch if you dare i have no idea how the audience score is this high bots i think
Jan 3 2024,positive,it was s o much better than the first one as it had a number of one liners and was funny  the special effects were outstanding and his acting was much better
Jan 3 2024,negative,boring movie stupid story no meaning just awful
Jan 3 2024,negative,too much going on at times  seemed like they needed all sorts of special effects to try to make a good movie
Jan 3 2024,positive,movie of the year for me personally for 2023 
Jan 3 2024,positive,they did a great job on this sequel i was very pleased with it i really enjoyed watching this movie
Jan 3 2024,positive,this had a really great story line and it must of took a lot of money and time to make thisthis is a must see its worth the money by 5 times
Jan 3 2024,positive,lots and lots of cgi but good entertainment maybe not for little ones  scary at parts
Jan 3 2024,positive,aquaman 2 dives deep into a visually stunning underwater world captivating audiences with its thrilling adventure kids are sure to love the exciting sea battles and charismatic characters the films vibrant visuals and engaging storyline make it a hit for young audiences creating a memorable underwater journey that kids will enjoy
Jan 3 2024,positive,it was a good watch i liked the special effects
Jan 3 2024,negative,worst plot   story suck
Jan 3 2024,positive,great movie the final movie of the dceu didnt disappoint

Jan 2 2024,positive,it was an awesome movie
Jan 2 2024,positive,loved seeing the story continue  looking forward to part3
Jan 2 2024,positive,could have been better
Jan 2 2024,positive,i thought the movie was good except for the terrible jokes and the vulgarity if they had made this movie more of a serious action movie instead of trying to turn it into a comedy the movie would have been perfect
Jan 2 2024,positive,great movie its just what its supposed to be a superhero movie for kids that doesnt expose them to any perverted nastiness excellent
Jan 2 2024,positive,exactly as expected
Jan 2 2024,positive,as expected for an action movie
Jan 2 2024,positive,it does start out a little slow but does improve  great special effects
Jan 2 2024,positive,everyone in the movie theater enjoyed the movie 
Jan 2 2024,positive,fun action for the family definitely a set up for a part 3
Jan 2 2024,neutral,watch at your own risk if you like the last movie this is fine if you wanted something more go see godzilla minus one
Jan 2 2024,positive,a fun film  where the highs were all time high but also the lows were the lowest for the franchise dont expect much and just enjoy the dumb roller coaster ride
Jan 2 2024,positive,comic book action light hearted loved it
Jan 2 2024,positive,sequal with exact same villians as the original  there is a new bad guy but hes more mcguffin than character aquaman has to travel to another forgotten realm to save the world from atlanteans who again want to destroy the surface at reckless cost to themselves because of how recklessly the land lubbers hurt them by damaging the environment because they lack the fancy ecofriendly tech the atlanteans have developed  but it was fun
Jan 2 2024,negative,boring  there is nothing relatively exciting happening in this movie  why was this movie made  there was no story to tell  nobody was demanding a sequel  another failed attempt at the light hearted comedy in the mcu it was far more cringe than comedy  thank god the dceu is officially dead
Jan 2 2024,positive,the effects and undersea imagery are amazing i love the ocean and this movie and the first one of course gives you a plunge into the depths and wonders of the oceans with a champion that makes real change it gives me hope for the world and makes me want to get out there and save the oceans myself the story is a good one and i enjoyed it very much and i am glad to have shared it with my kids
Jan 2 2024,positive,fighting was off the chain must see in 4dx
Jan 2 2024,negative,i realize nothing about the movie is based on reality but the story got way too far fetched and i lost interest acting was second fiddle to cgi overall we saw it but not something im looking to see again anytime soon
Jan 2 2024,positive,i loved everything about this movie i just loved jason momoa and patrick wilsons chemistry also the visuals were absolutely outstanding i seriously hope that they make aquaman 3 i would love to see it from an loyal dc fan
Jan 2 2024,positive,dc actually stayed true to the comics this time  great action wonderful special effects
Jan 2 2024,positive,the movie was not that good the  4d seats made it incredible what moviewe forgot all about the movie lol
Jan 2 2024,negative,honestly a poor rip off of ready player one like the raider fight was the exact same as ready player ones sixer fight the story is kinda dull especially because when i watched it i was kind of rooting for the villain as he was the only one with like any form of character arch and aquaman was not a great character and often acted childish towards other characters this film was basically a jurassic world and ready player one ripoff with i think hints of the lord of the rings i would never recommend this to someone who is older than the age of 9 as even though it is rate 12a it was just very much too childish towards that audience and seemed just slapstick comedy but gone wrong and even with the supposed to be emotional scenes it just was not good at all like it was on about bridges for way too long i am not joking seriously
Jan 2 2024,positive,it had an intriguing concept but poorly developed on screen as compared to the first aquaman franchise overall it was a very fun to watch movie
Jan 2 2024,negative,so bad i walked out after 25 minutes of suffering
Jan 2 2024,negative,no effort was put into the making of this film it is pure trash and silly
Jan 2 2024,positive,was looking for more action when the evil king was awakened  the movie ended too easily
Jan 2 2024,positive,aquaman and the lost kingdom is such an awesome movie i def recommend watching it and it was way better than the first movie and had more action and more exploring in the film and if i had to rate this movie i would say 1010 and i would watch this movie over and over again cause it was fantastic and props to jason and patrick fantastic work and the cgi was amazing
Jan 2 2024,negative,dont waste your time or money its one of the stupidest movies ever made
Jan 2 2024,positive,loved the storyline and all the great characters they added in this movie it was action packed and kept me interested the whole time loved this movie

Jan 1 2024,positive,i like movies like that and the actors are great  it also had a great storyline
Jan 1 2024,positive,good action   great story line  some funny lines  some campyness that distracts from those who take their dc characters serious
Jan 1 2024,negative,i walked out halfway through the movie it was unnecessarily weird with weird creatures all over the place for no reason and the story was boring there was too much fighting and not enough of a sensible story
Jan 1 2024,positive,predictable and sometimes silly but still a fun movie requires watching the previous movie to understand the character relations critics probably panned it because of the focus on climate change
Jan 1 2024,positive,action packed lived it
Jan 1 2024,negative,i was thankfully saved by a power outage in the theater  i didnt ask for a refund but if i had i would have asked for it with interest  seriously cant we do better than a tired sequel whose set up is so banal that it puts one to sleep before the movie gets going same old same old z z z z z
Jan 1 2024,positive,i loved more than first one a lot more action 
Jan 1 2024,positive,movie was good overall i personally would have liked to see more battle scenes

Jan 1 2024,negative,the evil characters were extremely creepy
Jan 1 2024,positive,the movie has some good funny moments and i liked the underlying theme of forgivenessbut go  im knowing this is a dc action film  meant for a bit of entertainment and not a serious drama great way to  spend an afternoon with my grandsons recommended for 5 and up
Jan 1 2024,negative,if you want to be saturated with the global warming message this movies for you theyre here to save above and below other than that its just your typical superhero moviesmash slash and bang wished throughout wed gone to see wonka really my 16 year old enjoyed it my 15 year old did not effects are great thats pretty much the only positive i have for it
Jan 1 2024,negative,nothing new the best of the movie was the brothers relationship the last sequence lacked action and it felt empty and lazy
Jan 1 2024,positive,if you enjoyed the first aquaman you will enjoy this one almost all of the original cast is back excluding willem dafoe and features a new addition to the curry family that is relevant to the story but not overdone i am sad that this is the end of the dcu but this makes a good bookend to close the series on there is just one credit scene and it isnt significant to any storyline but a good bit of fun all told its worth the watch
Jan 1 2024,positive,saw in imax and despite the heard factor which i take a star away  they did limit it  everything else this movie was great and better than the first one  story was decent and to the point good directing and special effects
Jan 1 2024,positive,enjoyed  very entertaining  heard should have been replaced however
Jan 1 2024,positive,this film was a poignant illustration of why we need to stop global warming we shouldnt have to leave the obligation of keeping the oceans safe to atlantis alone super fish shouldnt have to be cgi they should still be flourishing in our underwater nations stop pollution save atlantis be a superfish
Jan 1 2024,positive,fun movie i went in not having watched the first one watched in 4dx 
Jan 1 2024,positive,if you want a simple familiar plot that sets up a story of longlost brothers connecting with a super fun main lead then go see this its a good time  if you go in expecting something else i doubt youll enjoy yourself very much
Jan 1 2024,positive,its not a masterpiece however its still a fun movie to see like with the 1st aquaman movie
Jan 1 2024,positive,mid movie too much chaos
Jan 1 2024,positive,okbut not that good to go seeaquaman and the lost kingdom2023ratedpg13 i went to and sawaquaman and the lost kingdom2023at 300pmct sunday december 31 2023at great movies places namedalamo drafthouse cinemamovies placesin austintexastxi wrote my comments here at 1131amctmonday january 01 2024
Jan 1 2024,positive,very entertaining and what was expected  he is so charming that hard to see him get hurt
Jan 1 2024,negative,i really liked the original aquaman and was looking forward to this sequel unfortunately the movie seemed more preoccupied with lecturing on global warming than developing a story that would captivate the audience i would wait till this is on streaming if considering watching
Jan 1 2024,positive,the movie is a little weaker than the first aquaman but still very good   ill watch it a second time this is the best movie of this year 
Jan 1 2024,positive,a lot of action mixed with humor
Jan 1 2024,positive,delightful film with lots of energy theres an undertone of family but a heavier theme of greed and environment the fast pace prevents getting emotionally invested but otherwise it is enjoyable all the way through
Jan 1 2024,negative,i dont usually critique movies however this movie was horrible the beginning of the movie was boring and with each passing moment i kept thinking this will certainly get better it never did the acting on all accounts seemed so amateur actually aquaman acted like the whole thing was a big joke i finally looked over at my adult daughter and whispered im sorry but this  movie is stupid and she laughed and agreed she said she was even thinking of running over the grocery store while we watched it but we kept watching it and after we admitted we thought it silly  everything they said and did seemed so silly that we would crack up at how absurd it was then we enjoyed it  i did think randall park who played the part of the  scientist dr stephen did a good job now with being said one of 13 year olds  thought it was good and our nephew who was 13 said it was hard to follow the brotherly unity was nice at the end
Jan 1 2024,positive,holds the standard as one of the best dc movies fresh with a lot of comedies
Jan 1 2024,positive,i liked the humor in the movie and the good ending  it was an enjoyable two hours with plenty of action

Jan 1 2024,positive,i can hardly contain my excitement to witness this extraordinary film alongside my loved ones on the eve of new year it promises to be an indelible night brimming with sheer delight and endless laughter
Jan 1 2024,positive,this is my new favourite dc movie i will be proud to own this gem of a movie on blu ray
Jan 1 2024,positive,if you enjoyed the first aquaman and enjoy an occasional kooky performance from jason mamoa aquaman and the lost kingdom will be sufficient for you
Jan 1 2024,positive,it was a fun and exciting movie i loved it
Jan 1 2024,positive,great visual effects for the family
Jan 1 2024,negative,a retread of the same formulaic drivel weve all seen countless times before the cookiecutter franchise mcmovie slop is too stale and stultified to even bother describing just more of the usual sludge
Jan 1 2024,positive,this is a fun actionfilled sequel  spectacular special effects and lots of humor   not as good as the first movie but an enjoyable followup
Jan 1 2024,positive,i loved the action but theres to much plot holes

Jan 1 2024,positive,the 3d was fantastic

Jan 1 2024,positive,good action  good cgi  most of the time  and family
Jan 1 2024,positive,i enjoyed the movie
Jan 1 2024,negative,not the worst thing ive seen this year but still very mid and boring 
Jan 1 2024,positive,not the genre i usually see but it was enjoyable  action funny moments and special effects were great
Jan 1 2024,positive,great extremely fun movie stunning visuals lovable characters and great action   only downside i would say is it feels a bit stuffed and fast shouldve been about 15 minutes longer to stretch things out and give some breathing room still awesome fun movie and solid sequel to the first film which was great as well would recommend for the whole family
Jan 1 2024,positive,i think aquaman 2 the lost kingdom was great  i think they should keep jason momoa as aquaman to be honest the dceu justice league was really good and i doubt anyone will be able to meet their level of acting experience on the character as well as their love for the character
Jan 1 2024,positive,we enjoyed it immensely while i know there is violence and the threat of an infant being harmed it never happened plus there are plenty of other movies with far worse violence and harm i dont see what everyones knickers are in a twist about it was a great action movie with good defeating evil
Jan 1 2024,positive,not as good as the first but still really really enjoyable a flamboyant film full of action

Jan 1 2024,positive,this movie is much better than the first one the storyline was great and the movie stayed focused on one goal im glad we went to see  because i was leaning towards not since i didnt care for the first one the first one had too many storylines this one is worth a trip to the theater

Jan 1 2024,positive,loved the whole storyline all the flashbacks jason mimoa patrick wilson kicked butt
Jan 1 2024,positive,it was a good movie but not as good as the first one in my opinion
Jan 1 2024,positive,there was a lot of action never a lull went as a family of 8
Jan 1 2024,positive,i was pleasantly surprised thankfully they seem to realise early on that patrick wilson and jason momoas chemistry is the best part and their relationship becomes the focal point some funny moments and generally its an enjoyable film
Jan 1 2024,positive,the message in the movie
Jan 1 2024,positive,it was fun not very serious but had good chemistry between the leads and a sense of adventure and spectacle with heart at the center all of which it shares with the first film definitely worth a trip to the theater

Dec 31 2023,positive,it was corny but fun i enjoyed the playful way aquaman went on a family driven emotional journey
Dec 31 2023,positive,pretty good great special effects in 3d
Dec 31 2023,negative,in essence aquaman and the lost kingdom is a poorly crafted film that unsuccessfully concludes the already unsuccessful dc universe even a camera maestro like james wan delivers a weak performance resulting in a movie devoid of seriousness and failing to deliver the anticipated action making it an unpleasant watch i didnt have high expectations thinking i would derive enjoyment from the second film as i did from the first given that james wan was directing i thought i would grab my popcorn have fun and leave however the film didnt even allow me to savor my popcorn with its cringeworthy jokes
Dec 31 2023,positive,this movie was exhilarating from start to finish i absolutely loved the bonus scene
Dec 31 2023,positive,i loved the movie entirely

Dec 31 2023,positive,this movie was awesome love jason momoa lots of action and funny
Dec 31 2023,positive,sure the film dragged sort of and sure the visual effects lagged most of the time but what makes this film watchable and even kind of enjoyable is the performances jason momoa and randall park really were standouts

Dec 31 2023,neutral,nice colours  good effects fairly predictable
Dec 31 2023,positive,i enjoyed it  predictable but fun
Dec 31 2023,positive,excellent movie for the kids i really liked the story
Dec 31 2023,positive,great popcorn flick full of entertaining action and a few wellplaced laughs i shake my head at anyone that goes out to see a superhero flick expecting to see the next citizen kane if youre looking to get away and be entertained for a couple of hours this movie delivers
Dec 31 2023,positive,it might not be a groundbreaking movie but its still a fun ride the visuals are good the costumes look great and the story is good although slightly predictable
Dec 31 2023,positive,aquaman and the lost kingdom is serviceable swan song that is decently fun and entertaining
Dec 31 2023,positive,great action great dialogue fun
Dec 31 2023,positive,the movie was great i personally would have liked to see more action but i am excited to see which movie comes out next in the dc comics era as far as the storyline i think warner bros is doing a pretty good job staying close to that
Dec 31 2023,negative,well that was a couple of hours ill never get back predictable story line wooden acting excessive cgi to cover up holes in the plot  just a well choreographed b movie that should have gone straight to video
Dec 31 2023,negative,the dialogue abysmal the actors dialled in their performance  jason mamoa  could not be less bothered the villan arc was formulaic no tension poor action just lacklustre
Dec 31 2023,positive,fun movie with cool visuals akin to the first film
Dec 31 2023,positive,overloaded with cgi and action and not as much on story there is a story but its very mythological and not very relatable jason momoa and patrick wilson work great together and have a good blend of humour and brotherhood which probably what saves this film okay overall but nothing terribly original
Dec 31 2023,positive,its a movie where you can just turn your brain off for two hours its entertaining and was never bored not going to give any spoilers but if youre a fan of superhero movies youll definitely enjoy it
Dec 31 2023,negative,worst dc movie ever not only that dc didnt care about the lead actress beying the ct she is and should not have any roles what so ever  but the lead actor was terrible also
Dec 31 2023,positive,i must say most of the critics are blind dont listen to them go watch and think for yourself
Dec 31 2023,positive,good movie lots of action good humor  ignore the negative reviews
Dec 31 2023,negative,this movie was terrible worst movie ive seen in a long time the plot was confusing the characters were forgettable the humor was just awful and the ending was unsatisfying all in all just a bad movie not to mention the terrible cgi i honestly think a youtube chanel with nothing but an editing software could make a better and more interesting movie
Dec 31 2023,positive,such a fun and lighthearted way to end the dceu i had a blast watching this movie with my friends great action funny with some really corny jokes definitely a sequel im glad i watched
Dec 31 2023,positive,better than most recent marvel movies wish there was a part 3

Dec 31 2023,positive,it was cool i like the story
Dec 31 2023,positive,the movie was great unfortunately the movement of the chairs caused me a lot of discomfort i assumed i was paying for 3d as i requested online and it was much more i honestly wish i could have been warned before indulging over all great movie
Dec 31 2023,positive,i was happy the movie came out good and worth the wait will  watch again for sure
Dec 31 2023,negative,poor acting and predictable story too bad i liked the first movie
Dec 31 2023,positive,one of the best super hero movies out in a long time
Dec 31 2023,positive,i liked how the story line gave way to aquaman and his brother reconciling and fighting sidebyside against a ruthless army of enemies i think it safe to say there will be another that may highlight aquamans son coming of age and developing his powers
Dec 31 2023,positive,overral i appreciate the environmentally conscious effort the movie put in the exploration and design of the fishpeople in the  sunken citadel was amazing
Dec 31 2023,positive,it was funny and entertaining
Dec 31 2023,negative,what the heck happened to this franchise it was worse than blue beetle and the flash my son loves most movies and didnt even like this

Dec 31 2023,positive,good movie i liked the story the character development and how the stakes are higher in this movie the only flaw is that the comedic moments sometimes feel forced though sometimes it comes naturally
Dec 31 2023,positive,absolutely love the sounds effects it felt soo real the suspense and unexpected turn of events was crazyyyy i loved the main characters eyes my goodness they were gorgeous
Dec 31 2023,positive,honestly theres really nothing to complain about the movie was pretty much 10 out of 10 perfect honestly have no complaints
Dec 31 2023,negative,what a waste of time
Dec 31 2023,positive,dont listen to the haters if you like other dc movies you will like this one
Dec 31 2023,positive,this may be an unpopular opinion but i dont care    dude i just had so much fun watching this big dumb movie in imax i think i like it even better than the first one its so goofy and big and silly all the same time i feel like im a kid watching saturday morning cartoons just with 200 million budget i feel like mamoa  really settled into his role right as its about to end im glad we got this version of aquaman on to the new dcu
Dec 31 2023,positive,love this movie tons of action
Dec 31 2023,positive,great movie family loved it
Dec 31 2023,positive,while almost over the top in a few areas managed to be highly entertaining with a fun script and great vfx     this series has been about the best of dc zachs cut of justice league another win
Dec 31 2023,positive,action action action
Dec 31 2023,negative,the movie was too long  but my grandson and daughter loved it and they were why i was there

Dec 30 2023,positive,great ending where the good guys win  lots of action  the undersea world was awesome
Dec 30 2023,positive,good entertainment funny and pretty creative
Dec 30 2023,positive,the movie starts off a little slow but picks up in the second half it has a few scenes and one liners that made me laugh and the cgi effects were pretty well done the movie is definitely an entertaining movie to watch saw the movie in 3d and the movie makes good use of the effects the movie isnt spectacular but it is certainly worth a viewing
Dec 30 2023,positive,a bit formulaic but it was worth the price of admission some laugh out loud moments
Dec 30 2023,negative,felt like they made the movie because they needed to not because they wanted to
Dec 30 2023,positive,i thought it was good i wish the studio would let james wan cook loved the kind of horror element he added in scenes overall good movie
Dec 30 2023,positive,movie was disjointed and lacked tone it was trying to be an action comedy while also being serious there were various segments of bad cgi and the dialogue was cliched
Dec 30 2023,positive,manta again this movie could have been so much better giant octopus slithering on land as backup crazy they spend hundreds of millions on these movies and cannot get a good script
Dec 30 2023,positive,it has some goofy costume design but overall it was a really fun movie and i love the world building for atlantis    it is a evil villian is causing climate change the heroes need to help save the environment movie but if you know anything about aquaman that is absolutely what this superhero has always been about    definitely not a super deep movie but its a fun time and a great watch with kids too
Dec 30 2023,positive,special effects and humor between brothers
Dec 30 2023,positive,i thought aquaman was awesome great special effectsfull of action must see
Dec 30 2023,negative,it was dramatic when not necessary i laughed at parts that i shouldnt have laughed at but it was so horrible i couldnt stop laughing shazam was better then thisits not aquaman its aquamid
Dec 30 2023,positive,it succeeds at what it seems it wants to be  which is decidedly a less dour more 80s cartoony affair compared to the rest of the dceu films in that respect it delivers a lot of fun and some nifty worldbuilding  a few glaring plot holes and hokey outbursts notwithstanding patrick wilsons character was the only one with any real pardon me depth and  im not kidding  a couple times his facial expressions alone far outshone the rest of the casts acting yahya abdulmateen ii also rose to the occasion id say everyone else was fine just not noteworthy  but really that is more than sufficient for a vehicle like this
Dec 30 2023,neutral,marvel keeps spitting out flops or should i say disney a good movie
Dec 30 2023,negative,if your expecting a sequel that shows continuity between the first film and this one this movie isnt for you if youre expecting action packed sequences and fun laughs you may get one or two during the entire 2 hours honestly i know the production team was told to limit heards  screen time but to the detriment of the audience all you received in return were disjointed scenes with her and mamoa that ruined the entire flow of the movie i much rather they had replaced her or removed the character entirely its really a shame this movie wasnt better it had the acting talent but was a cgi mess this is probably the end of the aqua man series sincerely  a disappointed fan
Dec 30 2023,neutral,a lot of action fights and explosions  plot is thin
Dec 30 2023,positive,loved it a totally fun thrill ride
Dec 30 2023,negative,plot and characters were rushed ending was forced i was bummed the dceu was ending until i watched this i wish another studio would buy the dc rights so wb can stop ruining it
Dec 30 2023,positive,its what you expect from a jason mamoa and aquaman movie just have fun with it its more of a buddyensemble action movie this go round youll like it and your kids will like it ancient machines creepy creatures globe trotting world building silly jokes badassery and very impressive action visuals cant wait to watch again 
Dec 30 2023,negative,patrick wilson was toooo good for the lines he was given i cant remember much of the plot and the special effects were meh i like jason mamoa but he disappointed me with his thor impression love and thunder wasnt a success  what was james wan thinking
Dec 30 2023,positive,this movie was really good the cgi was amazing the filming and acting were really good the 3d part of it was also amazing the storyline was not crazy confusing i was on the edge of my seat for the entire movie wondering if aquababy was going die the fight seems really good it was so funny i even laughed a few times i would have liked some references to dc comics like batman or superman cameo or as seen which reboots the dceu to the dcu its to bad that this is the last dceu movie overall is a really good movie lets go dc
Dec 30 2023,positive,i enjoyed the imax experience movie was action packed and jason momoa will always be aquaman
Dec 30 2023,negative,forced lines  trying to be funny disjointed
Dec 30 2023,positive,good visuals but little over the top but thats why we go see jason mamoa
Dec 30 2023,positive,it was all good humor action drama story telling everything good
Dec 30 2023,positive,the movie did a wonderful job developing the relationship between arthur and orm it also had well written moments where smaller scenes would parallel larger issues of the movie there was a fight between orm and arthur on one side and an octopus robot on the other inside of a volcano which did a great job illustrating their problemsolving approaches so you could really see why they think about the job of ruling atlantis so differently  i did think it was a shame that such clever writing had to exist alongside some less nuanced work eg when the lost kingdom is being explained we get an establishing shot that looks like a cross between mordor and wwii nazi submarines just in case we couldnt tell it was evil  overall this movie did a lot of things the first one left me wishing for and it is an improvement on my memory of the first film so it did a really good job as a sequel
Dec 30 2023,positive,i liked this movie i was good i guess it was very funny and it didnt really mean anything
Dec 30 2023,positive,dont worry about the critics the visual effects and fighting scenes are beautiful
Dec 30 2023,positive,great movie and its a shame dc have cancelled any further films
Dec 30 2023,positive,in my opinion aquaman and the lost kingdom is the top 3 superhero movies in 2023 the special effect in this movie is as beautiful as avatar and the interaction between aquaman and his brother is fun however this is not the best way to end dceu and some scenes lack logics but its still a great movie to watch in 2023

Dec 30 2023,positive,good story line with  great special effects  and it includes family drama
Dec 30 2023,negative,terrible story line stolen story elements from star wars and lord of the rings awful acting same villain from first movie hard pass
Dec 30 2023,positive,people need to enjoy movies rather than come in trying to critique everything the first chance they get did we all forget were watching science fiction movie enjoy the good cgi the fun moments the beautiful underwater world created by hundreds of people working to put together a story for us to enjoy will this movie win an oscar no did you think it would if you did you went to watch the wrong movie i know ill watch this movie again in the future
Dec 30 2023,positive,the movie was really good wish the fight scenes at the end were a little more action packed but overall great movie
Dec 30 2023,positive,the movie was pretty good cool action scenes great cgi decent stakes i had a good time a fun time is all you can really ask for solid 8 out of 10 for me
Dec 30 2023,negative,aquaman and the lost kingdom was another predictable superhero movie following typical film tropes of a main character reconciling differences a journey to a secret location to retrieve something only to be diverted back to face against the villain with a thirst for vengeance although the film did have some entertaining action sequences the cgi looked at times messy and incomplete i was surprised by heards screentime however the mixed editing made the film overly bloated to tell a straightforward story seen many times before
Dec 30 2023,positive,if you like aquaman then you will like this one not as good as part one but it was alright watched in 4dx so that extra element added some fun to the film
Dec 30 2023,positive,i liked the relationship between arthur and orm would have liked to have seen the batman cameo
Dec 30 2023,positive,despite all the negative things i kept hearing and bad reviews i read i honestly loved it my 4 yr old also loved it of course and in his words it was awesome
Dec 30 2023,positive,i really enjoyed this movie   good story and lots of action  jokes were a little corny sometimes  but overall it was a great family movie

Dec 30 2023,positive,very entertaining with a stellar cast and cool story love when james wan implements elements of horror at some points it was like lord of the rings meets pirates of the caribbean meets the thing meets star wars      honestly i wanted to turn around and watch it again
Dec 30 2023,negative,i wanted to like it but it was boring
Dec 30 2023,positive,patrick wilson and jason mamoas dynamic carries a predictable and generic plot that weve seen too many times before unnecessary comedy at unnecessary times and wasted potential of what couldve been a fantastic villain is what keeps this movie from being fantastic but patrick wilson and jason mamoas dynamic and the action is what keeps this movie entertaining for me
Dec 30 2023,positive,loved it better then the 1st one
Dec 30 2023,positive,good movie dont care about the court stuff i enjoyed this movie

Dec 30 2023,positive,movie was good better than i expected
Dec 30 2023,neutral,felt like the whole movie was an excuse to do 3d perspective visuals  some of the monsters seemed like they were out of the mummy or scorpion king rather than the dc universe

Dec 29 2023,positive,it was funny and action packed
Dec 29 2023,negative,nice graphics but why the bad guy could not get a redemption as aquaman brother
Dec 29 2023,negative,sad dull dumb ever been to a bad party you feel pressured to make fun and you do everything you can to liven things up but it goes nowhere thats poor jason in this film hes filled with his usual joy de vivre but all his clowning couldnt get this lead balloon off the ground some great performances by nicole kidman she makes everyones acting better she is so committed to her role patrick randall and patrick wilson that seemed like they were from some other movie perhaps david leslie johnson mc goldrick should shorten his name so he can put more of his writing into his scripts  so so many bad lines an inattentive or overpressured director forgot to cut or order rewrites although superhero movies are the 7eleven fare of the cinema everyone knows its too expensive doesnt taste good is not good for us but we all line up to squirt chili and cheese on our heart clogging hot dogs  this movie is that hot dog  too bad there is no pepto for the brain  we just keep getting dumber watching this stuff it should at least be fun
Dec 29 2023,positive,i liked the use of the same actorsactresses from earlier movies and the family matters theme
Dec 29 2023,positive,fantastic fresh and fun great movie for the family massively enjoyed this
Dec 29 2023,positive,much better than expected
Dec 29 2023,neutral,generic but very watchable optimistic and quite fun i like family theme and interactions arthur  orm i like scale of world  without this time space multiverse bulls to much cgi  result lots of mediocre cgi some jokes landed rest not so much but still fun to watch ps and way better than the marvels
Dec 29 2023,positive,the film delivers on what it promises action and more action  for cgi lovers you will love and hate the film at times  fans will like it

Dec 29 2023,negative,i wanted to like this movie  the acting and visuals were good but the dialog was very juvenile  too much narration and not enough verbal interaction  im not sure i would even recommend for streaming
Dec 29 2023,positive,went in not expecting too much but really enjoyed it in the end definitely over hated
Dec 29 2023,negative,the movie was a disgrace to all dc movies im glad the dc extended universe closed
Dec 29 2023,positive,love this movie i honestly think this is much better than previous they keep getting better and better jason moana is the bomb
Dec 29 2023,negative,aquaman and the lost kingdom to live up to expectations with a disjointed plotdeveloped characters pacing issues while visuals are impressive they salvage an overall disappointing rating  2 out of 5
Dec 29 2023,negative,very very bad dont know with which movie to compare mix of bad kids movies science fiction and wannabe different
Dec 29 2023,positive,i dont get most of these critics that part of this site i always ignore i go for proper peoples reviews this movie albeit not as good as the first was fun to watch and had some great scenes love the cast well most of them anyway heard could have been swapped with a guppy and i would have been happy
Dec 29 2023,negative,literal the worst movie i have seen of 2023 the whole thing was one big commentary on climate change which led to a horrible plot with stupid dialogue what happened to good stories and entertainment value this had neither honestly dont waste your time with this one you will regret spending the money
Dec 29 2023,negative,i did not care for this movie  i enjoyed the 1st one but this is slow and i did not find the stars arrogance entertaining what so ever  i left half way through the movie
Dec 29 2023,negative,some neat comic book visuals aside aquaman and the lost kingdom drowns in perfunctory adventure tropes and serves as an unfortunate swan song for the dceu
Dec 29 2023,positive,i dont care what anyone says the movie was really entertaining and we enjoyed every bit of it
Dec 29 2023,positive,dont listen to the critics  this movie was entertaining  its not going to win any oscars but it is an enjoyable film to watch  good action descent banter and mild comedy  i dont watch movies to pick apart the craft of acting  i watch to enjoy the story  this story wasnt bad
Dec 29 2023,positive,viewing this movie with an unbiased mindset i truly enjoyed this movie great action all the way through and a believable story outside of the behind the scenes drama this is a great and fun watch with the family
Dec 29 2023,negative,acting wasnt top notch across the board really only seemed to be about 4 really good actors in this movie some scenes were cut at really strange moments reminded me of a bad star wars rip off under water overall was a let down for me
Dec 29 2023,positive,it is good honest movie that is fun and entertaining for all
Dec 29 2023,positive,it was a decent fun family friendly movie nothing crazy
Dec 29 2023,positive,the first half of the movie was good  the final battle scene took forever though and caused me to fall asleep
Dec 29 2023,positive,true to the source material strong supporting characters and villain not sure if it was the material but momoa didnt keep up with a solid supporting cast
Dec 29 2023,positive,another entertaining film with jason momoa aquaman and the lost kingdom has all the elements a superhero film should have in addition to the wellwritten story and the brilliant acting work of the entire team i personally enjoyed the music and comedy scenes
Dec 29 2023,positive,you cant expect much from the deceased dceu it shows that many scenes were rerecorded and a part is missing batmans
Dec 29 2023,positive,great christmas gift to an aquaman groupie
Dec 29 2023,positive,enjoyed the action and graphicand it held my attention
Dec 29 2023,positive,much better than the first it was funny and fun
Dec 29 2023,positive,a highly entertaining film that really has so many cool moments that feel love craftian and visual feast doesnt really reach the heights of the first film with the obvious reshoots and editing around mera since its the last dceu film they shouldve just left it as is
Dec 29 2023,positive,jason momoa is so fun to watch having fun that it makes for an entertaining evening at the theater
Dec 29 2023,positive,good or great movie but aquaman isnt my thing
Dec 29 2023,positive,good movie it was funny filled with action and entertaining
Dec 29 2023,positive,this movie was pretty fun not as exciting or thrilling as superhero movies usually are i really liked the cinematography in this movie though the fight scenes were really cool and fun to watch overall its a decent movie if you like aquaman in general youll have a really fun time james wan did a great job directing this film i recommend it if you are a fan of aquaman or if you like just about any action superhero movie i just wish it was a bit longer it movies pretty fast with the short runtime but its a nice movie to go watch at the theater
Dec 29 2023,positive,jason momoa patrick wilson and yahya abdulmateen ll make the movie entertaining and visually it looks good  but the plot is all kinds of bad
Dec 29 2023,positive,freaking amazing  great action packed  drama  fun filled cinematography fabulous actors  story linecant wait to see it again  next film winner action movie i love it all 
Dec 29 2023,negative,not executed well a film to fall asleep to
Dec 29 2023,negative,i once saw a man fall from a building onto concrete that was less horrific than this movie
Dec 29 2023,neutral,first half hour was a bit slow but it picked up visual effects were amazing as expected great score
Dec 29 2023,positive,the visuals and action scenes were cool if you liked the first one youll probably like this one since its more or less the same
Dec 29 2023,positive,amazing movie  jason momoa is my dude
Dec 29 2023,positive,aquamans new adventure is enjoyable entertainment but devoid of particular functions if not the mere involvement of the spectator at least on an aesthetic level   hilarious tones loud and parodic entertainment technical expertise lots of action cinephile quotes and visual inventions are guaranteed but dont expect anything more or better than the previous episode   the film continues and concludes the discussions undertaken in the previous chapter on the bond we have with the past the weight of personal and introspective growth on the part of its protagonist observed in relational dynamics and in the importance given to family and human relationships  but also on the topic of the dangers of climate change inviting collaboration between peoples for a decisive environmental commitment   the vast and evocative ocean world as well as the buddycomedy between aquaman and orm are the most effective parts of a film in which not everything works the rhythm often discontinuous and unbalanced should be noted as a negative the adventurous action less inspired than the previous episode the narrative developments sketched out and some sequences outlined in a superficial or rather hasty way   nonetheless the dynamic and hyperchromatic staging itself as well as all the careful work on the image and the formal apparatus compensate quite effectively for the limitations of this work and its potential which unfortunately remained unexpressed   overall it is an honest sequel pleasant to look at but in itself not very incisive enough to leave something in the memory or heart of the viewer
Dec 29 2023,negative,as the dc universe comes to a close we are given one last movie before a reset with aquaman and the lost kingdom unfortunately they go out with a whimper and the worst comic book movie i have seen in a while there is some visual flair occasionally humorous moments and technically decent action scenes however the issue is the story is bad and the movie is just boring and not a lot of fun anyone who knows me knows that i am generally a defender of the dc movies and have had fun with all of the other movies besides this one i really was not invested and was relieved once it was over overall it is a movie that truly embodies the issues comic book movies are facing right now and i really hope something good happens creatively with the dc characters in the years to come
Dec 29 2023,positive,i loved the graphics and cinematography
Dec 29 2023,positive,we saw aquaman in 4dx it was so much fun and entertaining to watch it with the motion seats because the movie was actionpacked
Dec 29 2023,positive,i absolutely loved  this movie  i dont care what any snobby movie critic says go see it i enjoy the first aqua man but love this one even more
Dec 29 2023,neutral,where to startand why there were plot gaps the size of the mariana trench my only ocean reference honest the only actor who could believably deliver a line in the entire film was patrick wilson in fairness the dialogue was so clunky and contrived that it would be a challenge for the best of thembut he managed to pull it off the entire screenplay made a solid argument for the use of ai to write a script becausetheyd probably do better they try and fail over and over to inject humor in too many scenes and jason mamoa just doesnt have the chops or the depth to pull it off i could go onbut whyjust dont or do
Dec 29 2023,negative,i didnt think it was possible to make a movie dumber than suicide squad congrats  you did it aquaman 2 is now the worst movie i have ever seen
Dec 29 2023,positive,not oscar worthy but not as bad as the critics proclaim for me at least i left my cares away for two hours and happily enjoyed it and my pop corn
Dec 29 2023,positive,pretty good had a good time with the family
Dec 29 2023,positive,draw out and could have made the villain stronger
Dec 29 2023,negative,id give it a higher score but this was the final movie of the dceu and i realise when written they didnt know that but it would have been nice to close out the dceu in some manner acknowledge it this looks like its in the middle of the franchise and we should wait for aquaman 3     if this is the final breath of the dceu then it was a failure  this is how the dceu goes out this is how it ended what a joke and what a disservice to the fans
Dec 29 2023,positive,great movie amazing graphics highly recommend full of action funny moments will see it again
Dec 29 2023,positive,movie was awesome and action packed some funny one liners  the movie drew you in from the beginning and keep you enthralled til the end
Dec 29 2023,neutral,a sloppy movie that is painfully mediocre and average with a disappointing villain and bad cgi but still provides good fun to keep the audience partially engaged in its plot
Dec 29 2023,negative,didnt live up to the first one
Dec 29 2023,positive,average action hero movie storyline makes sense
Dec 29 2023,positive,many questions few answers
Dec 29 2023,positive,the sequel warner bros made was more fantastic than the first the film gave me the best experience and had good humors in it id recommend everyone to see the first movie then the second its worth for me to see it again

Dec 29 2023,positive,the artsetting was everything
Dec 29 2023,positive,3d really added to the movie
Dec 29 2023,positive,i like the first one better but the comedy up to the action is phenomenal i also did think the movie was as bit rushed but it was still pretty good
Dec 29 2023,positive,a fantastic sequel with great action and great chemistry between aquaman and orm
Dec 29 2023,positive,i really enjoyed the dceu despite its problems this was actually a more complete story compared to other entries so dont let bad press deter you if you like aquaman then its a fun time i thought the visuals were actually pretty impressive
Dec 29 2023,positive,the film is good but the problem is that it doesnt know when the joke and the action are when its serious etc
Dec 29 2023,positive,enjoyed it from start to finish
Dec 29 2023,positive,loved the comedy and chemistry between the brothers
Dec 29 2023,positive,amazing movie loved it a must see
Dec 29 2023,positive,look the only failings in this movie is dcs  they had a huge success with the 1st  we were ready for another huge pic  why  we love aquaman  we love this buddy love movie between 2 very different brothers    this was an action packed fun film with good laughs  love seeing arthur with a baby
Dec 29 2023,positive,a bit a comedy and packed with action family friendly
Dec 29 2023,positive,love it gotta watch both aquaman movies in a double feature
Dec 29 2023,positive,the whole movie 
Dec 29 2023,positive,it lived up to a good hero movie
Dec 28 2023,positive,better than expected decent villain compared to the first am film overall worth seeing if you like superhero movies
Dec 28 2023,negative,i liked the first aquaman    unfortunately it became as usual something geared toward children      too much humor like the last thor movie and jar jar binx in the form of an octopus was present again   im pretty easy with movies typically   my wife and i left halfway through   smh
Dec 28 2023,positive,good action and plot
Dec 28 2023,positive,action packed and funny i loved the banter between aquaman and his brother the movie has a great message about family and protecting the ocean highly recommended
Dec 28 2023,positive,i was really up set that i paid for 2 motion seats n seats werent working then u tell ur customers not wait to buy tickets on line n also charge fees i was very disappointed i had my heart on motion seats
Dec 28 2023,positive,loved the special effects   somehow the brotherly love back and forth the joking and i got you didnt sit well with me
Dec 28 2023,negative,the worse movie in 2023 the story was bad the acting was sub par and frankly it was boring 
Dec 28 2023,negative,its okay not theater worthy
Dec 28 2023,positive,honestly liked it more than the first i was surprised critics yall are too tough on dc
Dec 28 2023,negative,wow the superhero genre really is dying a pitiful death and this film has only served to contribute to that messy is the best word for it
Dec 28 2023,positive,predictable but good quality graphics fight scenes were lame save your money and rent it
Dec 28 2023,positive,the movie was very action packed i enjoyed the plot as well
Dec 28 2023,positive,wasnt  disappointed just love the marvel and d c world and i love the injection of humor in some of the scenes come ont its science fiction so it cant be too seriouslol
Dec 28 2023,negative,it was too dark to watch in real 3d good waste of 1960 ticket plus taxes you dont walk into these movies expecting stories this isnt flash or dark knight or spider man or iron man  so action and cinematography is the only reason to walk in if you fail in graphics and the screen is hardly watchable then you lose it outright forget the story  even without story line see how avatar 2 had used water sequences well in 3d and aquamans water sequences are all waste and dark
Dec 28 2023,positive,entertaining funny with a few elements of horror a smasher and mustsee on the big screen best in 3d plus atmos  story never boring wild music  liked it very much
Dec 28 2023,positive,itdefinitely had a lot of action great story line strange creatures had great imaginary designs good side effects worth the   expense

Dec 28 2023,negative,that movie was trash no real meaningful storyline super corny jokes okay cgi only positive was jason mamoa not worth a watch
Dec 28 2023,positive,like the humour and the action was good
Dec 28 2023,negative,the movie consists of poor scripts comes across as unnatural  a mediocre plot and bad acting i wouldnt recommend this movie
Dec 28 2023,negative,disappointed patrick wilson should never have come back  the original story was close to the dc comic  this was weak  no more aqua man this jumped the shark too many times
Dec 28 2023,positive,i thought it was very good and did not deserve the hate online it was action packed and i liked seeing the brothers come together since i am not a big comic book fan comparing all to canon this and that i thought it was very entertaining and my little girl was able to come with me something these darker comic movies i simply cannot do do you really want to take a small girl to see some mans naked a even if it is thor i am just saying i hope if they do another we dont have to wait so long
Dec 28 2023,positive,not one of those epic superhero movies but fun and corny if you liked the first one youll like this one
Dec 28 2023,positive,good movie but too long for what it was  should have been 30mins less like most films these days  by the time the final battle came which was good i found myself having lost interest if the pacing was better and the movie tighter it would be a lot better
Dec 28 2023,positive,i found the movie was very interesting and humorous and it portrayed a very necessary message about how global warming is changing our planet overall i found this movie worth the watch the cgi i found to be a lot better than the first movie
Dec 28 2023,positive,the follow up was great definitely didnt see a baby happening but truly enjoyed the movie
Dec 28 2023,positive,loved the moviegreat story and awesome special effects
Dec 28 2023,positive,solid movie better than the first no oscars here but just good fun on the negative side the humor was forced at times and the continued reference to climate change was tiring but the positives outweighed the negatives with decent humor and great fighting scenes better than most of the marvel junk from the past couple years
Dec 28 2023,positive,solid movie and great for watching with the family   significantly more entertaining than what marvel has released in past few years  dont believe film critics low rating 
Dec 28 2023,positive,i really enjoy the first movie this is more of the same the dynamic with jason and patrick is very dumb but fun dumb i was laughing of the sillyness    give it a shot
Dec 28 2023,positive,it was predictable fun nothing mind blowing just lots of visuals fighting and action no overt messaging except ecology preservation which i think is fine and necessary
Dec 28 2023,positive,this movie was great lots of action funny and very entertaining loved the story line my teenagers loved it
Dec 28 2023,positive,should have been released earlier entertaining and the right length please make another one that is less humorous

Dec 28 2023,negative,do you have sleeping problems this is a great movie for it no story boring too much fighting scenes with a lot of cgi and the worst thing jason saying bad jokes looks complete dumb
Dec 28 2023,negative,it was a horrible show of how badly you can make a movie its honestly embarrasing how trash this is
Dec 28 2023,positive,a good film lots of action quit pace and good story well worth a watch
Dec 28 2023,negative,fandango charged me for a mx4d movie experience but system was broken at theartre and fandango refused to refund me the ticket price    i purchased 3 tickets for aquaman at   island 16 cinema de lux 185 morris ave holtsville ny 11742  theartre refunded all purchases made at location but since i used fandango they couldnt and fandango refuses so i recomend purchase direct and not use fanfango since they dont honor their sale
Dec 28 2023,positive,a fun and visually pleasing superhero movie the beleaguered dceu ends on a decent if not groundbreaking spectacle
Dec 28 2023,positive,the film was good not grea
Dec 28 2023,positive,bester than i thought and bester than the first one
Dec 28 2023,positive,sophisticated layers of storytelling high energy action  adventure good humor tied into solid natrative
Dec 28 2023,positive,had an absolute blast love the first outing and loved this new one despite all the negativity and poor press and movie bombing loved this movie sad to see the end of jason as aquaman
Dec 28 2023,positive,nice way to end his story
Dec 28 2023,positive,it was nice mostly good effects beside the close up action shots of aquaman good direction and some really good shots less god dialog and acting
Dec 28 2023,positive,was a decent movie highly entertaining 
Dec 28 2023,negative,prepare to be bored and for your iq to drop one of the worst movies ive seem in a while i can say even worse than the marvels  seriously who wrote this  only funny part was about a bug
Dec 28 2023,positive,movie was good a bit predictable just because the good vs evil thing but enjoyable

Dec 27 2023,positive,it was a pretty good dc movie
Dec 27 2023,negative,if millions of dollars is going to be spent in making a film it seems to me that hollywood has forgotten the most important part where those dollars should be focused it is not on special effects but rather on writing a good story plain and simple     aquaman 2 missed the needs interesting writing memo and what is tragically left is a big budget film that will leave moviegoers scratching their heads wondering why they wasted their hard earned money and time over the holiday season to see it big effects to not equal a good story telling this film lacks good story and was  just bad

Dec 27 2023,positive,action packed better than the first aquaman movie you wont be disappointed believe me coming from a long time marvel follower
Dec 27 2023,negative,not my  favorite super hero movie it felt flat awkward and slow relying on same old same old story line
Dec 27 2023,positive,very entertaining  good story line  loved the 80s music as well as the sharp witty lines quipped throughout the movie
Dec 27 2023,positive,this movie has received a lot of bad reviews i recommend you go watch it it was enjoyable aquamans humor was spot on the story was good and you get to see a lot more of the seakingdoms i enjoyed this much more than i expected due to the poor critic reviews

Dec 27 2023,positive,a good adventure with plenty of challenges for the hero along with appropriate humor sometimes a bit talky but the action scenes were well done

Dec 27 2023,positive,i just didnt  like it and was disappointed in the movie itself  the first one was exciting and make total sense  the second one was just  well if you cant say something nice dont say anything more
Dec 27 2023,positive,could do without heard  slow start but overall enjoyed the movie
Dec 27 2023,negative,stupid and goofy compared to the first nearly as poor as the flash
Dec 27 2023,positive,while aquaman 2 is far from perfect it is a solid enjoyable watch
Dec 27 2023,positive,fun entertaining and action packed definitely worth seeing in theaters
Dec 27 2023,positive,real fun movie all the action scene and acting were perfectly done i thought the story was bit more childish then the previous one but definitely super entertaining
Dec 27 2023,positive,if you saw the first movie and loved it for the graphics writing and action then buckle up spanky because this is not that the graphics were great and maybe even better than the original the action was spotty in that it was mostly predictable but there were a few nice surprises the writing is where i felt they dropped the ball it seemed as if they might have been trying to keep the adults while simultaneously and low key aggressively targeting the tweens there were unnecessary and sometimes childish jokes that felt forced and obviously meant for the benefit for the younger viewers i saw the movie with my son and younger daughter who are both adults we had a discussion about it afterwards and my daughter brought  up the recent end of the writers strike which could explain why the story felt like it was not quite finished my actual rating is 35 stars out of 5 but the system doesnt do halfsies
Dec 27 2023,positive,what the hell do the critics know i saw the movie for myself and it was awesome i bet they only get paid more to give negative reviews
Dec 27 2023,positive,while it was entertaining the 1st one was far superior
Dec 27 2023,positive,the ending is disappointed
Dec 27 2023,neutral,compared to the acclaimed initial installment of aquaman this sequel leaves much to be desired certain aspects of the film were perplexing while others consisted of recycled moments the acting however was truly commendable nevertheless when it comes to furthering the narrative of the franchise there were numerous opportunities for improvement that remained untapped
Dec 27 2023,positive,such a fun movie with lots of laughs  the ending was a bit less than stellar but all in all we enjoyed it
Dec 27 2023,neutral,this movie can make the audiences enjoy as it contains not only exiting and humorous scenes but also drama and bromance scenes however this movie lacks freshness and it does not leave as much of an impressive or impactful feeling as the previous aquaman in 2018
Dec 27 2023,negative,absolute garbage  ive only walked out of two cinema movies the second fantastic beasts and now aquaman 2    a pointless preaching film that flips about like a landed kipper     yeah we get it the planet is warmingbut i dont want that shoved down my throat at every opportunity i want to be entertained    but it gets worse     with invisibility suits and octopus that play musical instruments couple with bad cgi     look when they steal the stuff about 20 mins in   they drive some squid shaped water craft  come to hatch not much bigger than the craft then suddenly three fit with ample room    dont waste your life
Dec 27 2023,positive,good movie for the big screen
Dec 27 2023,positive,must watch absolutely amazing
Dec 27 2023,positive,my expectations going in to watch the film where low i watched it with my girlfriend and we had a blast such a good and emotional way to end the dceu put a smile on my face
Dec 27 2023,negative,sorry but this film is just the most boring thing you can possibly imagine there is no thematic consistency throughout the film and the plot is so strikingly mundane and the stakes just feel so low combined with a lacklustre and cliche antagonist even the acting was very bad with no particular good performances from anyone the cgi is jawdroppingly bad that at times i felt i was in a comedy as opposed to a sequel film of a main character of the dc cinematic universe highly recommend you do not watch this film
Dec 27 2023,positive,good movie the aquaman movies are really the only dc movies i have liked the second was as good as the first
Dec 27 2023,negative,it was weak sauce  script was weak plot was weak and disjointed and pandering we get it global warming is bad  it seemed like it tried to do what star trek used to do so well  provide thoughtful and creative social commentary but it was an uncreative pandering drumbeat of global warming is our fault and we need to do something  not that i think that message is wrong but this movie was a poorly contrived vehicle for inspiring change and certainly a poorly contrived vehicle for entertaining
Dec 27 2023,positive,delivery on everything i expected from a dc movie lots of action cgi was good and the storyline was well delivered due the above average acting and directing definitely worth the price of my ticket cant wait to watch it again when released to streaming
Dec 27 2023,positive,just go and have fun  dont overthink it  its a light hearted romp with great visuals  some corny dialogue but nothing that sent me out of the theater  it was fun  best experienced in the theater
Dec 27 2023,positive,ill preface this by stating i preferred the first one which i was a pleasant surprise this movie was definitely flawed some poor cgi cgi baby humour that didnt land and some ordinary writing however it was enjoyable and immersive in parts though it is the final dceu film and is largely inconsequential if youre able to enjoy this in isolation for what it is its a fun enough time
Dec 27 2023,positive,spoiler alert it was very slow starting out i was disappointed that he was above water living a mediocre life at best then they added a council that had to approve his decisions it started picking up and to me it still didnt meet or exceed my expectations
Dec 27 2023,positive,worthy sequal great action and visuals manta takes center stage as the main villan fun movie topo and storm are fantastic
Dec 27 2023,positive,i cry because aqua man and his mom died in the ending but was a good movie
Dec 27 2023,positive,dont understand all the negative reviews as an audience experience  liked it effects and storyline was good
Dec 27 2023,positive,i was a little sad because i really enjoyed the movie i dont know about the rest of the world but warner bros didnt promote it at all i didnt even know it was out my train was delayed because of snow so i had some time to kill so i went to the cinema and found out it was out
Dec 27 2023,negative,this movie was mid i hadnt seen the first aquaman but it was so easy to figure out the plot simply because it was so straight forward and basic 20 seconds into the movie i was laughing because the cgi was so 2002 that i couldnt help but chuckle kong in the previews before the movie looked 10 times more real than these actual human actors on the screen in front of me also the entire movie builds up to the fight between aquaman and the big evil guy spoilers next i think that man beat the evil guy in 15 seconds dude straight up threw his trident at him and bro died in the spot that was it it was over i was so sad after that i almost walked out then and there and i shouldve the inspirational speech at the end of the movie made me cringe so hard the actors for extras they chose off the street were so goofy and making me giggle again then the movie randomly ended on a terrible im aquaman and that was that i couldnt shake the ick it gave me this is why marvel is on top never wanna watch another dc movie again
Dec 27 2023,negative,rotten tomatoes did something no other platform did have a user rating system so corrupted its more irrelevant than the critics ratings on every platform from imdb to metacritic and letterboxd the movie got the expect 50 and still probably overinflated score rating but on rotten tomatoes which if you think mediocre nobody tasteless critic reviews was already making it irrelevant managed to have even its user score beyond faked by bots kudos on this flaming pile of hopefully soon ashes
Dec 27 2023,positive,this movie was entertaining and it had a lot of heart i dont see these kind of movies for big social discourse or expect it to change my life its pure entertainment the actors are solid as usual the special effects looked like video games at times but all in all id see it again
Dec 27 2023,positive,lots of action with a good plot just as good as the first one

Dec 27 2023,positive,great movie dont settle for the bad reviews just enjoy the entertaining thrill ride throughout its a simple sequel movie that will also end the dceu but in a good way even tho the story was a bit too rushed it was fine worth the trip to the theater was better than expected 
Dec 27 2023,negative,this movie had me ready to walk out more than once the plot got better for a few moments and then go down hill again congratulations on ruining aquaman it would have been better not to have released this
Dec 27 2023,positive,it was absolutely spectacular the acting the character development the story the special effectsevery aspect of the movie i really dont understand why the media says it did poorly at the box office my only regret is that we may not see a third movie my family loved it
Dec 27 2023,negative,weird editing story twisted around and too confusing   amber heard was definitely not liked zero chemistry
Dec 27 2023,positive,movie was action and funny with a good story line
Dec 27 2023,negative,visually beautiful action wasnt that bad but overall the story was bad not gonna lie the first 20 minutes they definitely could have cut it also whoever wrote jasons script definitely shouldve cut some of the humor off like it was too much
Dec 27 2023,positive,it was a good movie and a good sequel to the first
Dec 27 2023,negative,momoa just phoned it in for this one dont waste your money
Dec 27 2023,negative,there are so many things wrong with this movie why live with his father when he has a mansion was the script written by a 12 year old is aquaman never going to mature any or will the king be a bro his entire life do characters get hit a ton and never get hurt only because i like dc and the characters from the comic made this movie remotely watchable
Dec 27 2023,negative,this movie was terrible  bad acting bad story contrived star warslike characters that are supposed to be cutefunny but arent cheap laugh lines that bring zero laughs characters that you cant care about a predictable save the earth from global warming theme groan worthy scenes united nations etc  one of the worst movies i have seen in a long time
Dec 27 2023,negative,dc has great characters they simply do not have great writers they are wasting the best heroes with dumb storylines

Dec 27 2023,positive,really fun movie that just wants to give its audience a good time mission accomplished
Dec 27 2023,negative,terrible i think im over marvel and dc anything
Dec 27 2023,positive,there were several times when the storyline drug and arthur had some really bad jokes that were sort of like spending time with svengoolie the special effects were fun to watch especially their hair flowing in the water the standout item was the ever evolving relationship between arthur and orm
Dec 27 2023,positive,i felt aquaman was just great fun pure nonsense special effects and fun
Dec 27 2023,positive,great action  visual effects was entertaining especially on d box seating
Dec 27 2023,positive,not as good as the first movie  i really didnt care for it

Dec 27 2023,positive,action packed fast paced
Dec 27 2023,positive,this is a great movie saw it twice already and may see it again great to watch with family over the holidays and friends too overall really fun and exciting and isnt afraid to challenge the audience to follow multiple emotional rides and allegory directions simultaneously
Dec 27 2023,negative,i think the target market for this movie probably is an eight year old boy it really was campy and boardered on ridiculous in places we wanted it to love it because we liked aquaman but five of us left kind of shaking our heads
Dec 27 2023,positive,aquaman and the lost kingdom sends the dceu in a mostly seamless way as we make way for the dcu rebootfrom the performances to the action sequences to the musicit certainly makes quite a splash
Dec 27 2023,positive,it makes me sad that this is the end of this universe but its a perfect ending ill definitely miss jason as aquaman hes just fantastic a definite must see for dc fans
Dec 27 2023,positive,defitnetly a popcorn flick and not a blockbuster most in attendance enjoyed it
Dec 27 2023,positive,it was as stupid as i expected but it was still pretty enjoyable
Dec 27 2023,positive,great film very entertaining one of the best films of dc
Dec 27 2023,positive,the pace of the story was slow in a couple of places the fight scenes made it worth going to see
Dec 27 2023,positive,it was good better than the ratings on imdb led me to believe even my 12 year old daughter liked it and she usually hates comic book movies i liked the light humor that they used throughout the movie certain times i found myself laughing at the shhtick jason momoa would use i do wish the writes had given us a small superhero crossover type appearance from other dc characters injected into the plot but that didnt happen all in all it was good though
Dec 27 2023,positive,mh husband and i thought it was a great movie
Dec 27 2023,positive,the sea creatures in 3d were awesome i really liked the movie and arthurs little baby is so cute
Dec 27 2023,positive,love love love this movie ties in well with the first movie is a must see glad to see that orm and authur settled their differences and were a good team hope they do a aquaman 3 oh stay after the credits start there is a mid credit scene with orm
Dec 27 2023,positive,loved the visual scenes  great ending thought lots of action if that is your thing overall good for teens and up
Dec 27 2023,positive,not great had some decent actions scenes but the story line felt so drawn out  the scenes with heard and mamoa were incredibly awkward  it all was just terribly flat
Dec 27 2023,positive,this movie was awesome the complaints i keep hearing are along the lines of it was fun but it didnt do anything new    what exactly were you expecting from an aquaman movie a dramatic retelling of the great depression its a pulp action movie its purpose is literally to be a fun time    im starting to think criticsand the social media wannabe critics dont understand what movies even are    movies are not going to save the world remove the stick from your butt for two hours of your miserable life and try to enjoy something for once
Dec 27 2023,positive,great movie the action was amazing and there were action scenes throughout the movie highly recommended

Dec 27 2023,negative,the movie has bad acting and it just doesnt do what it needs to do in terms of portraying the story
Dec 27 2023,positive,loved it liked it a lot better thn the first one
Dec 27 2023,positive,not sure why the negative reviews story line was decent  not a 5 star movie but definitely worth the watch if you liked the 1st one
Dec 27 2023,positive,action from beginning to end
Dec 27 2023,positive,i loved the brothers story line i think jason got to show more of himself in this movie watch them struggle to work together when the were polar opposites was funny
Dec 27 2023,positive,solid story and good action  dialogue seemed clunky at times and some cgi shots looked like they werent completed  fun movie and worth watching
Dec 27 2023,positive,so good and both of the heroes are so sexy
Dec 26 2023,positive,mostly really good there were a few corny moments and the baby peeing in arthurs face numerous times was a little juvenile plus the end where he picks up the mic and shouts i am the king of atlantis i am aquaman was a little thin but overall the action was really good and the story was decent
Dec 26 2023,positive,totally awesome movie  dont listen those other up tight critics who wouldnt know a good movie if it bit them in the ass
Dec 26 2023,positive,some of the story seamed a bit forced and the cgi was obvious at parts that said great movie the interaction between him and his brother was great i kind of wanted a cool fight scene at the end where orem and arthur tag teamed the villain but hey cant have them all
Dec 26 2023,positive,i liked it because it was more for adults instead for young children
Dec 26 2023,positive,its got jason mamoa it was a good movie as well
Dec 26 2023,positive,despite the numerous reviews on the internet and youtube i watched the movie objectively and found it had the same level and amounts of elements from the first movie so i dont understand the trashing
Dec 26 2023,positive,i thought it was good a bit slow at the startp but overall it was a decent movie jason was hot
Dec 26 2023,negative,i want my refund my seat was taken by someone else i had to leave the theater because i was feeling uncomfortable
Dec 26 2023,negative,i cant believe i paid money to see this i wish i could get my money back this the worst acting the worst directing of any movie ive ever seen in my adult life please heed this warning and dont waste two hours of your life away you cant get back

Dec 26 2023,positive,i was pleasantly surprised with this movie   it was action packed and had a fairly good storyline   i was  happy they let jason momoa have quite a few comedic moments which is what i enjoy seeing him do   this movie was worthwhile and a good way to spend a dreary day
Dec 26 2023,negative,boring waste of cgi resources kids will probably like it
Dec 26 2023,negative,i must confess to being disappointed with this second film in the aquaman story i approached the first film with a bit of trepidation but after seeing it i found it surprisingly fresh and exciting the cgi was well done and the characterization of jason mamoas role of aquaman made you route for for his character throughout the film     this new release completely missed the mark the storyline was jumbled and confusing while mamoa did a good job with what he was given the dialogue made him seem naive and at times incompetent he did not leave a feeling of a genuine leader instead you had a feeling that he didnt know what he was doing or where he was going with the task at hand    a bigger point is that while the first film gave you the feeling that the king was the true leader of the undersea residents this new film suddenly and unexpectedly brings in a council that has the right to overrule anything arthur brings forward     finally the way the film presents arthur as a father figure to his new son arthur jr is childish and unnecessary there are even scenes where the child pees on his father at one point even redirecting the stream to hit arthur in the face this may be an attempt to bring humor to the film but it appears unnecessarily opportunistic distracting and cheap    i am sometime a bit disappointed with a film but when i watch it a second time i find things that make the film come together better and in so doing ot gives me a better feeling about the future of the franchise i can only hope that happens this time but ill definitely wait until it come out on a premium channel
Dec 26 2023,positive,really enjoyed the story the beautiful water effects and when he rescued his brother from jail and the water scene were he went from skinny weak to muscular n strong had funny snippets you heard from time to time really enjoyed it well done 
Dec 26 2023,positive,it was a great movie
Dec 26 2023,positive,it was action and adventure all through the movie it had an incredible storyline
Dec 26 2023,positive,it was ok sometime to pass the time with your kids

Dec 26 2023,positive,exceptional special effects great action movie for the family
Dec 26 2023,positive,the critics got this one all wrong  we already know this movie is based on and round atlantis and the underwater fantasies   the movie was very entertaining the plot was good  the movie was not boring nor predictable  you have a bunch of critics out there throwing salt for no reason  will the movie gross 11 billion only time will tell  is it worth seeing on the big screen most definitely
Dec 26 2023,positive,this movie was insane the story line was perfect the characters were perfect everything was perfect about this movie
Dec 26 2023,positive,enjoyable movie great action and effects some predictable comedy cheese but otherwise its a solid flick
Dec 26 2023,positive,so this was pretty good  probably the best that  dc has released so far  nice complex plot characters you care about etc  seem like it was awfully expensive for admission
Dec 26 2023,negative,boring uninspired waste of time james gunn has a low bar to start with superman legacy
Dec 26 2023,negative,somehow even worse than the first one
Dec 26 2023,negative,im really sad to say its just not good to many extra things that was not needed or took away from the film looks like it was written by 4 different people who did not talk to each other also why was there vampire inspired atlantans who survive on blood im dont claim to know a lot about making films but come on make it simple and less side parts and extra that dont make it a smooth film stick to rival brothers coming together to defeat an enemy of the kingdom who is using old atlantic tech with a couple epic fight scenes and ya done less of the jokes better in depth writing aqua man behaving like a teenager huh a baby who could have been binned from the start zombie looking people bin it dune inspired shots an octopus who did not need to be there but beeped like it was a droid from star wars crab king not needed  an evil city with a name that starts with necro with the living dead in it come on seriously not originality the only good acting in it was the scientist how is that possible feel like they gave up or people did not have a clear vision or goal so disappointed i want this film wiped from my memory and to have my money back venom 2 was even better than this mess of idiotic 10 year old child ideas
Dec 26 2023,negative,so sad that ah ruined this one

Dec 26 2023,positive,i have no idea what problem critics have with super hero movies this was the best one ive seen since before 2020 these critics are basically being paid to trash a fun family movie i hope theyre proud with their lifestyle choices
Dec 26 2023,positive,everything was phenomenal
Dec 26 2023,positive,absolutely fantastic especially in 3d if one of them doesnt win an award oscars are rigged
Dec 26 2023,negative,i laughed so hard in all the wrong moments idk i think kids arent stoopid dis ppl have to step up the manipulation is so obvious they just asked gpt hey make a script and this was it the last scene aquaman for president with the cringe voice over take this morals words and cry u idiot looked and felt like a golf add the only thing missing was a golden retriever and a rainbow lame make it more lame
Dec 26 2023,positive,its fun enjoyable movie just shut up and have a good time in the cinema weve been filled with bad movie this is a great take love it the classic adventure movie still hope for a final showdown between the main character and the villain jason you rock this character my man please be aquaman for as long as you can
Dec 26 2023,positive,the movie was great i really like the scifi technology model and the visual effect

Dec 26 2023,positive,story was  poor ending was not good but the computer generic images were good
Dec 26 2023,positive,plot was predictable actors were semi bored loved jason momoa of course
Dec 26 2023,negative,some poor special effects and cheesy scenes  entertaining but could have been a lot better
Dec 26 2023,positive,jason momoa does his best to try and carry the movie  and only at times does he show he can deliverbut there is something about all recent dc movies in that they always fall flat and inferior to marvel i dont know who  is to blame but how can the dc higher up continue to not notice this
Dec 26 2023,positive,great action and good storyline
Dec 26 2023,positive,it was a good movie but the beginning dragged on and the action wasnt till towards the end
Dec 26 2023,negative,this movie has no original content which even my 15 yo noticed
Dec 26 2023,negative,very boring not exciting
Dec 26 2023,positive,i totally enjoyed the movie story was good chemistry between mamoa and wilson was great worth watching again
Dec 26 2023,positive,needless to say it was easy on the eyes to watch but i also absolutely love the story line from beginning to end love the fact everybody was the original actoractresses cant wait for the next one
Dec 26 2023,positive,great time felt like a great indiana jones adventure some things they may have overdone some things didnt add up and corny here and there but i enjoyed the whole movie aquaman 3 please
Dec 26 2023,positive,great graphics  like avatar  good plot
Dec 26 2023,positive,fun witty and an exciting movie 
Dec 26 2023,positive,i enjoyed it was it great no but if you liked the first movie you should enjoy this one too some jokes fell flat and at times the cg was lacking but overall better than most marvel flicks released in the past years
Dec 26 2023,positive,the grandsons liked it but us adults didnt think it had a lot of substance
Dec 26 2023,positive,i thought the movie was good kept me interested the whole movie my family enjoyed it also cant wait for another one
Dec 26 2023,positive,the story line was great it is actually a sequel great action love vs hate
Dec 26 2023,positive,it was an action packed movie and the pageantry was excellent there was nothing that i disliked about the movie with the movie ticket
Dec 26 2023,positive,the cgi was not up to marvels usual standards still worth the price of a matinee
Dec 26 2023,negative,if i could give 0 starts i would poorly written script terrible cgibland  just rubbish
Dec 26 2023,positive,this is by far my favourite dceu movie in quite some time i personally enjoyed this more than the first one they tried to pull off a few too many jokes and some missed the markwhile others were completely predictable but this was a good story with plenty of action and heaps of effects
Dec 26 2023,negative,some very impressive visual effects but the movie was let down by weak characterization additionally the dialogue was so embarrassingly awful and cliche ridden i thought it had been written by ai a very lackluster and disappointing film imo
Dec 26 2023,positive,i loved the family unity between brothers but there was so much more violence and fighting with creatures this time and it got old
Dec 26 2023,neutral,all around bad acting   humor felt forced and unnatural
Dec 26 2023,positive,i love dc  someone who may appear confident and capable to others but internally struggles with insecurities selfdoubt or other emotional or mental challenges it can also refer to someone who puts on a facade of strength in order to hide their vulnerability its important to remember that everyone experiences challenges and vulnerabilities in different ways and its okay to not always feel strong its also important to seek support and help if youre struggling
Dec 26 2023,positive,i thought it was great good story like a lot of action also
Dec 26 2023,positive,great story and action packed
Dec 26 2023,negative,the story was disjointed and didnt feel complete  it felt like a film going through the motions with no real stakes there where serious topics being glazed over and a one note villain it relied too heavy on the visuals which werent overly amazing and felt like they took pieces from many other successful franchises and pieced it together like a scrap book the audience are a lot more intelligent than studios think and can handle real thought out topics stories and characters the saving grace was the chemistry between jason momoa and patrick wilson even then the comedy didnt always land compelling story first people story first
Dec 26 2023,positive,very generic but still entertaining like all superhero movies
Dec 26 2023,positive,great movie cgi was obvious but held to a minimum overall cgi quality 710 plot was cliche and felt familiar it was every superhero movie ive ever seen
Dec 26 2023,positive,i loved this movie i think better than the first one  such a perfect superhero great story that doesnt take itself too seriously  i dont care what the critics say aquaman 2 was a lot of fun
Dec 26 2023,negative,basically a predictable hum drum of bad man gets infected with evil good man fights bad man coupled with hateful evil brother who becomes hero  oh also yeah its a film that is just basically good vs global warming  really  the highlight was the credits  so i could finally leave
Dec 26 2023,positive,it was action packed none stop  it was funny i enjoyed it
Dec 26 2023,negative,corny jokes bad acting by mr mamoa poor dialogue no suspense very predictable nobody in the packed theatre i was in laughed at all the narrated introduction felt cheap the cgi left a lot to be desired
Dec 26 2023,positive,why rotten tomatoes critics gave 35 but the movie is really good
Dec 26 2023,negative,hnmmm mamoa is soo cheezy to the  point like it feels unnatural
Dec 26 2023,negative,everything about it felt rushed or chopped together the animation and 3d modeling at some parts looked unfinished majority was relatively entertaining but expected better from a high budget film also i am aquaman is correct because its certainly not as entertaining as i am iron man
Dec 26 2023,positive,the movie is a joy ride we see another side of arthur aquaman and more development of atlantis and its kingdoms what i love the most was orms development and it actually makes you root for the guy despite what critics are saying this movie is fun action packed  definitely a must see
Dec 26 2023,positive,this movie was great it had enough action and even comedy to keep me watching also i loved the unityfamily aspect
Dec 26 2023,positive,it was good  i would watch it again
Dec 26 2023,positive,i thought it was fun and enjoyable
Dec 26 2023,positive,fun popcorn movie not as bad as many saying silly sure but mamoa makes it fun
Dec 26 2023,positive,the storyactors and the music
Dec 26 2023,positive,i like the sense its about family and unity of community working together
Dec 26 2023,positive,better than expected momoa is as charming as ever action is soso story is basically the same as thor 2  theres even a loki joke in there unusually it finishes better than it starts not great but more entertaining than the critic review score would suggest
Dec 26 2023,negative,it was a bad premise and horrible writing ancient technology and something that look like a ww2 subplane mix beating all the new technology of atlantis then atlantians riding mechanical sharks like motorcycles just dumb the last scene i am aquaman was horrible to copy ironman
Dec 26 2023,positive,lots of action the storyline was understandable and fun to watch even with the additions made
Dec 26 2023,positive,i enjoyed it immenselybetter than the original
Dec 26 2023,negative,horrible writing corny boring and strange that his wife was mostly strangely missing  we left early because it was that bad
Dec 26 2023,positive,enjoyed it a lot but very few people in the theater i hear its a flop but i dont know why
Dec 26 2023,positive,it was good but not 5 star worthy it felt short and felt predictable
Dec 26 2023,positive,i rarely say this about a sequel but i actually liked aquaman 2 better than the first one i was cautiously hopeful that the visual details would be just as good as the original and they definitely did not disappoint its a fun fantasy that openly does not take itself too seriously and is therefore a refreshing change from the more serious drama of most movies in the genre i laughed throughout the actions scenes were excellent and the relationship between the brothers was perfectly executed by momoa and wilson i was looking for some good time entertainment and i got it
Dec 26 2023,positive,not as good a storyline as first one but computer graphics much better
Dec 26 2023,positive,i enjoyed every minute of this movie  great storyline  i will definitely watch it again
Dec 26 2023,positive,luv how they portray brotherly love and not promote hate
Dec 26 2023,positive,story line was ehh but lots of action didnt fall asleep better than the 1st one
Dec 26 2023,positive,the comedy of jason mamoa
Dec 26 2023,neutral,fun parts but a very generic superhero film the genre needs new energy
Dec 26 2023,negative,complete mess  some moments but it felt like i was in a virtual video game
Dec 26 2023,positive,funny and action packed
Dec 26 2023,positive,its very entertaining my family and i have enjoyed watching it  i dont care what critics said 
Dec 26 2023,positive,awesome job on everything
Dec 26 2023,positive,thank god i did not go by critics ratings and negative reviews but with my trust in director james wan  i watched it in 4dx 3d and it was totally worth it  really enjoyed it and i definitely recommend it 
Dec 26 2023,positive,very good the storyline closed the issues created in the first aquaman
Dec 26 2023,positive,it was a good movie i took my grandson and he enjoyed it
Dec 26 2023,positive,i thought the storyline and the action was good jason mamoa never disappoints
Dec 26 2023,negative,the theater power went out 10 mins into the movie and wouldnt refund me my money
Dec 26 2023,positive,great movie tons of action and lots of laughs
Dec 26 2023,positive,love the whole thing from beginning to end from action to comedy and story  
Dec 26 2023,negative,the plot honestly is forgettable the elements which made aquaman 2018 was the connection arthur had with mera and how she thought him to im brace his heritage and who he was meant to be while he thought her about the mistakes she had of the human world and on all hoe they needed to work together but the lost kingdom gives his now wife a role as though she simply a trophy wife who stands there while the relationship strong be stronger after the birth of there son instead arthur teams up with a half brother he barely know and dispicies as his brother never excepted him as being of both land and see which key him believe himself superior in what world would they ever work together with all the drama as well as recycling a villan also honestly i only just saw it and ive forgotten most of it already
Dec 26 2023,positive,i dont know why the reviewers hate this movie so much maybe its because of the global warming message which is admittedly pretty heavy handed i liked the first one better but it is always hard to make a movie feel fresh when you are dealing with known characters that weve all seen before this film was not a bad way to spend a few hours over the long holiday weekend
Dec 26 2023,positive,i think this storyline was really good highlights on strengths of family brotherhood and being transparent
Dec 26 2023,positive,story was a bit long winded at times with cgi overload entertaining but something that can wait for rental or on demand  end credit has no upcoming story value and just a homage to what was shown earlier in film
Dec 26 2023,positive,fun plot twists with lots of action and special effects
Dec 26 2023,negative,when i wasnt cringing from the terrible dialog i was checking my watch to see if my misery would soon end this felt like it was hastily thrown together there was no chemistry between the characters aquaman acted like an overgrown teenager all in all it was insulting to expect the audience to find this entertaining
Dec 26 2023,positive,not enough story line too much battle
Dec 26 2023,positive,the movie was entertaining at times but man can we be more creative than global warming being the bad guy  its over done and ridiculous and this is coming from someone who respects the science behind global warming  stick with the campy one liners and fun fight scenes  beyond that it falls very flat
Dec 26 2023,positive,great film full of understandable irony good acting fine humor so enjoyable
Dec 26 2023,negative,i walked out half way through i loved the first movie but this was absolutely terrible it was dark not acted well and just disappointing
Dec 26 2023,neutral,it was a 1010 great action movie     3510 if youre more of a plot pacing character development person
Dec 26 2023,negative,terrible just terrible graphics dies towards the end and im fairly certain the creators dont understand physics or how things work in the real world for whatever reason the merpeople can swim faster than their underwater jet skis and only utilize that ability when they just really wanna jason was both mom and dad to the baby which wouldve been fine had he been a single father just a silly f movie
Dec 26 2023,positive,it was awesome very interested and entertaining  it went way deeper with the brothers then i thought was fantastic
Dec 26 2023,positive,great movie lets go for 3rd
Dec 26 2023,positive,visually stunning  had some pretty good humor but was a little cheesy in a few parts  good action and fight scenes  had a decent story line  martin short as the pirate  crime lord boss was very funny  all in all it was a good time
Dec 26 2023,positive,it was worth the time spent
Dec 26 2023,positive,great story line and all around great movie
Dec 26 2023,positive,great movie especially when viewed in 3d  lots of action
Dec 26 2023,positive,absolutely a must see if youre an aquamanjason momoa fan its so good the critics are definitely wrong on this one 
Dec 26 2023,positive,i like the intensity of most of the scenes
Dec 26 2023,negative,i think its the worst movie over ever seen its a bunch of ai generated sequences stitched together with no cohesive plot there are plenty of action sequences with stupid goon creatures
Dec 26 2023,negative,serious contender for the razzies this year  it the ultimate proof big budget and a lot cgi cannot do good with a shitty script  dont waste your time or money on this
Dec 26 2023,positive,entertaining an pretty good watch if your with friends
Dec 26 2023,positive,another dc movie with horrible cgi its normal yet 
Dec 26 2023,negative,acting was horrible granted it was bad in the original but somehow every character was able to surpass it this time bar scene was straight rip off from star wars complete with jabba the hut character wait for it to come out in tv if you must watch and save your money
Dec 26 2023,positive,funny and good family entertainment
Dec 26 2023,positive,awesome graphics i love how jason momoa really made his character take on his hawaiian ancestry tons of action and lots of laughs throughout the entire movie
Dec 26 2023,negative,dull do not waste your time
Dec 26 2023,positive,i liked the film it had a deserved ending
Dec 26 2023,positive,i honestly thought it was a pretty good movie it was a pretty good ending to a upanddown universe this movie might not have a high critic rating but it is what it is
Dec 26 2023,positive,its too jason momoa  but thats also why i like aquaman
Dec 26 2023,positive,better than the first one  great fx and character development
Dec 25 2023,positive,its better than you think easily better than some of the other superhero movies released in 2023
Dec 25 2023,positive,it was very entertaining and i liked they taught that brothers can work through their issues
Dec 25 2023,positive,this was a good movie  it had a little bit of everything throughly enjoyed
Dec 25 2023,positive,fun action flick dont understand all the hate  better than some other comic book movies in 2023
Dec 25 2023,positive,the special effects were the best part
Dec 25 2023,positive,great movie worth watching
Dec 25 2023,negative,horrible walked out very disappointed
Dec 25 2023,negative,boring poor storyline mediocre acting but that could be due to the weak storyline
Dec 25 2023,positive,loved it  lots of action comedy and sea life
Dec 25 2023,positive,good movie same good or better than the  first one
Dec 25 2023,positive,love dc  marvel and the aquaman character is one of the fun ones the story line was done surprisingly well considering the top foolery that occurred with the cast
Dec 25 2023,negative,first aquaman was amazing this one not so much very boring not much action  looked luje a video game
Dec 25 2023,neutral,acting wasnt believable overly predictable couldnt get emotionally vested with any of the characters it seemed like it was relying on special effects scenery that was absolutely beautiful
Dec 25 2023,positive,just a good fun show for the family we enjoyed one and two
Dec 25 2023,positive,ignore the critics as it sounds like they didnt watch it and just refer to a default superhero movies have had their day type writing movie was fun visually amazing and some full on fight scenes great popcorn fare which is what we expect from a superhero movie
Dec 25 2023,positive,great movie definitely dont want to miss seeing this one
Dec 25 2023,positive,our ohana had a great time at the movies on christmas day watching jason momoa in his finale outing as aquaman cheeeehooooo 
Dec 25 2023,positive,i thought it was better than the first one
Dec 25 2023,positive,exciting enjoyed the show
Dec 25 2023,positive,the movie was phenomenal and had a bunch of gems for living life
Dec 25 2023,neutral,the movie was lacking consistency there were alot of plot holes and moments were you can tell they switch up the scriptwithout even looking for it the fight scene were decent but could of had alot more substance in in the dialog it felt like aimless fighting a few timesover all i would watch it again
Dec 25 2023,positive,told the story well easy to understand what was happening  lots of action nonstop
Dec 25 2023,negative,terrible i think im done with marvel
Dec 25 2023,positive,90 plus percent cgi more like a video game than a movie
Dec 25 2023,negative,trash my brother was so pissed he walked out bro lackluster dumb plot everything sucked no significance to dceu at this point reboot my god
Dec 25 2023,negative,seemed like it ripped off most of the marvel lotr got star wars and every other scifi action movie    meh
Dec 25 2023,positive,you know  it was visually stunning and the fight scenes were enjoyable but i feel like there was a better story there before the reshoots were done i wish we couldve save the jl one more time in this film somehow to give thr dceu a proper entertaining ending
Dec 25 2023,positive,great graphics   normal entertaining marvel movie  a little corny
Dec 25 2023,positive,very humorous and an enjoyment to watch i actually will be going back to see you the second time
Dec 25 2023,positive,excellent movie probably my favorite aquaman to date
Dec 25 2023,positive,light hearted super hero film to end the dceu the marvel references were good throwbacks to the 4th walk
Dec 25 2023,positive,lots boom  i loved it
Dec 25 2023,negative,annoying due to the yet againhollywood stokedglobal warming and one world government theme  are the people who meet in davos the same people who prop up hollywood to make movies like thishmmm  think about that  also it is a pretty demonic themed movie which the spirit in me sees as another foothold for satan  we need more good christian movies offered
Dec 25 2023,positive,excellent movie  action scenes were great and the humor was very good  i know that critics dont think much of dcmarvel productions but they need to lighten up  worth the view
Dec 25 2023,positive,the concept was there the brother dynamic was nice to see ambers scenes were strange seemed like there was more there but we didnt see it overall it was entertaining confusing at times bit overall it was fun
Dec 25 2023,positive,i like him as aquaman he plays the hell out of that role 
Dec 25 2023,negative,booty butt buns writing is garbo and plot is corny
Dec 25 2023,positive,im a fan of the first movie i was afraid this was gonna be a let down since james wan had to make a lot of reshoots because of james gunn instead its a masterpiece of the cinecomics genre for me really amazing it stands up to the level of the first one me and my family we all loved it a lot cant wait to buy the blue ray   absolutely a must watch amazing effects visuals sceneries plot and action scenes its absolutely one of the best cinecomics ive ever watched
Dec 25 2023,positive,good nonstop action with a sprinkle of comedy nice movie for teens and adults
Dec 25 2023,negative,first outside dramas of the cast and james gunn literally saying none of this matters aside this movie is terrible    the lack of care put into the acting the story heck the costumes they did not care at all     the story turned aquaman into thor from love and thunder the ending he says i am aquaman in i am iron man style and after the abysmal acting by everyone except oceanmaster and manta the lack of even getting into shape by momoa was offensive to superhero fans     2 stars out of respect for the crew visual effects artist and mantaoceanmaster who truly tried
Dec 25 2023,positive,i loved the movie it was a great installment to the movie i wish it would have given a little more depth from where the first ended to now but it was fine if you followed the dc world
Dec 25 2023,positive,a lot of laughs and action
Dec 25 2023,positive,lost kingdom delivers expected fabulous action sequences with a cast that is devoted to their roles james wan continues to exhibit mastery filmmaking with visuals worthy of a blockbuster but the film fails to take itself completely serious as its plot demands with jason mamoa falling for silly gags that dont pay off as wished   the plot needed another movie to complete its potentially brilliant arc but i guess with the dceu dissolved it didnt have the chance to another almost something the dc movies have come to be known for   aquaman 2 is a fun ride 
Dec 25 2023,negative,terrible chaotic plot juvenile dialogue weird character formation  this one made my top 3 movies i wish i had slept through
Dec 25 2023,positive,with overtones of surface dwellers are ruining our planet  i could do without the non science greenie rhetoric    the aqua man of the  70s this aint  not a total disappointment but it was the first movie of novemberdecember that got my dollar which goes to show that theres nothing for intelligent folks to enjoy at the cinema anymore
Dec 25 2023,positive,perfect movie for all ages
Dec 25 2023,neutral,this is decent the plot feels like okay
Dec 25 2023,negative,3d graphics was horrible not the same 3d effects i grew up to seeing back in the 80s 90s    not worth any extra cost    the plot  the special effects were great
Dec 25 2023,positive,dont let other people opinions stop you from watching a fun movie
Dec 25 2023,positive,mediocre film that will entertain you just dont expect too much the storyline are super cliche being recycled too much across many movie from all time little bit cringe here and there some jokes hut some miss some poor cgi here and there some are good mediocre but perhaps a little bit above the average
Dec 25 2023,neutral,fairly entertaining considering the overload of supehero movies but not much of a story to tell decent performances though
Dec 25 2023,neutral,always the first one is better
Dec 25 2023,positive,not making 200m in first week is not a flop the movie got 120m in just 3 days so how was it a flop putting bad publicity way ahead to discourage audience to watch it in theater is pure manipulation
Dec 25 2023,positive,jason is great  visuals awesome  some quirky jokes but that is also part of the fun
Dec 25 2023,positive,james wan delivered a beautiful looking film with what felt like a somewhat choppy ish story until the mid to third act where it showed the true heart of the film it wasnt necessarily about fighting a big bad at the end but more about the journey with a flawed king and a redeeming previous villain
Dec 25 2023,negative,i was very bored throughout the majority of the movie it did nothing to hook me the dialogue was really really bad and the actors just seemed like they didnt want to be there the cgi was good overall and atlantis looked as stunning as ever with great action sequences but it wasnt enough to elevate this to a good film the pacing was all over the place there were some very questionable editing choices and i just found it impossible to get attached to the characters they just didnt feel real or believable to me which was a bi product of the acting in my opinion i felt no emotions during this to the point where aquaman couldve died and i would not have cared decent film not one ill watch again for a long time and i just wish they wouldve done better for the last hurrah of the dceu
Dec 25 2023,positive,i really enjoyed the movie lots of action and good visually effects i enjoyed the movie sound track and the funny lines a good movie reminding us that we are family no matter what happens good or bad the reviews gave the movie a low score cant always go by that i saw it at a dolby cinema 2549 expensive was a good time
Dec 25 2023,positive,awesome family packed adventure cheeeeuuuuu 
Dec 25 2023,positive,action packed and funny very entertaining
Dec 25 2023,positive,the movie is fun tons of action and visuals are great great for the family to watch together
Dec 25 2023,negative,complete garbage to be honest this movie completely botched the opportunity to bring the audience into the world of atlantis and fully explore some of the underwater kingdoms but instead chose the film over 80 of the movie on land the last time i checked this movie was called aquaman yet he did nothing aquamanlike ive never been the person who believes in ai scripts but this truly felt like one there was no heart to the film and no explanation as the the antagnosts motive until the last 30 minutes of the movie     moreover im personally over the whole possession theme that every film seems to want to follow nowadays so in my opinion this movie definitely wasnt worth the money or time if this is what dc continues to put out i honestly fear for them
Dec 25 2023,positive,loved it action all the way through lots of comedy and i enjoyed the storyline i liked it better than part 1
Dec 25 2023,positive,it was simply amazing i love this it is a good movie to see as a family tbh really like the interactions between orm and arthur seeing dad arthur and seeing orm getting a redemption
Dec 25 2023,positive,critics got it wrong again this was very entertaining
Dec 25 2023,positive,the movie is great rotten tomatoes professional critics cannot be trusted at all
Dec 25 2023,negative,too much like watching a loud cartoon at the beginning  i was expecting better special effects  the movie actually got better when patrick wilson came on and he and jason were doing a lot of comedy together the film improved on the last half
Dec 25 2023,negative,i do not understand how audience is giving this movie a high score i assume most of them have the score scale reversed    movie fails in every category horrible movie
Dec 25 2023,positive,it was action packed throughout the movie
Dec 25 2023,positive,took the family to watch aquaman and the last kingdom yesterday absolutely loved it  didnt look at my phone once which says allot will be watching it again but this time in 3d it was fantastic great job go watch it now
Dec 25 2023,positive,great sequel better than the first one
Dec 25 2023,positive,good movie hopefully they will do a spin off for the villain
Dec 25 2023,positive,yo aquaman fights a giant squid coolest thing ever good action and amazing effects mamoa gives the best performance since michael pẽna great movie def check it out cant wait for more
Dec 25 2023,positive,very culturally impactful from the land to the sea we all live and must protect our resources
Dec 25 2023,positive,its not a masterpiece academy award winner  has the usual plot but not boring entertaining with excellent cgi special fx the critics were far too extreme in trashing the film the audience score for aquaman 2 is more reasonable  accurate
Dec 25 2023,negative,is a pity that all those good actors and performances were overshadowed by the annoying bad acting presence of a lame actress such as aheard it had so much potential but i barely made it till the end wich was also lame btw
Dec 25 2023,positive,i enjoyed the film the back and forth between arthur and orm just made the movie some of the underwater cgi with the actors didnt quite look right but the majority was pretty good  its a good popcorn flick to just kick back and while away 2 hours
Dec 25 2023,positive,i like it the plot was great and i loved the story well done
Dec 25 2023,negative,awful in every single way  bad performances bad story awful cgi  dceu came a mess left a mess
Dec 25 2023,positive,ok so i may be the only one to say this but i thought this was a very good movie although it has a few issues but its actually very good the first one is still better though
Dec 25 2023,positive,as usual the audience reviews are closer to what i experienced the rt critics consistently seem unable to recognize a good movie when they see one i would bet that none of the rt critics could even write a good movie the 80 audience rating is close to what i would have given it yes there are similarities to the first aquaman but that can be chalked up to the fact that it involves most of the same main characters as the first but it had fun dialogue moments excellent action sequences and jaw dropping visuals which is what i was expecting from a fantasy movie i can say that dc is getting better at superhero movies if youre interested at all in this movie see it for yourself
Dec 25 2023,neutral,the first hour was slow wasnt the greatest the acting wasnt great
Dec 25 2023,positive,while not a perfect movie by any means there are far worse ways the dceu couldve ended at least we got one final appearance from jason momoas iconic aquaman out of it
Dec 25 2023,positive,its better than the first one its an action movie theres a lot of action its exactly what an action movie should be i enjoyed it and was honestly surprised it was as good as it is i was expecting the typical sequel let down and instead it was refreshing change of pace to anyone that liked the first movie you will like this movie a very good effort for a dc movie
Dec 25 2023,positive,great movie lots of fun with great action and a little humor
Dec 25 2023,positive,an entertaining movie with an interesting plot  jason momoa was great  aquaman is a different kind of super hero
Dec 25 2023,positive,action and enough comedy throughout makes this a great family movie a new high point for the dc universe of movies

Dec 25 2023,negative,the dialogue was terrible corny stupid and insult to senses dumbest movie ever
Dec 25 2023,positive,great special effects it was a little slow in the beginning but picked right up very well done stay for the credits quick last scene

Dec 24 2023,positive,love the movie   love the action the story line and  the actors  a lot of action in the movie kept me on my toes and engaged
Dec 24 2023,positive,totally predictable but entertaining patrick wilson and nicole kidman  as aquamans brother and mother  easily steal the movie from a company of muchlesser actors
Dec 24 2023,positive,entertaining jason momoa is aquaman
Dec 24 2023,negative,story line obscured by way too many explosions and bad guys constantly attacking too many star wars and indiana jones imitations writing and acting so bad it was humorous
Dec 24 2023,negative,not even a good cartoon 
Dec 24 2023,positive,while it wasnt mind blowing all in all it was entertaining
Dec 24 2023,positive,lots of good action and a great story line
Dec 24 2023,positive,i thought the movie was good i was glad that orm and aquaman coexisted and did things to help each other for the sake of the world i hope that they remain able to coexist in the future
Dec 24 2023,negative,not great i think over the top acting dialogue felt fatigued watching it all flash not style usual cliche stuff felt like going through motions watching it in my opinion

Dec 24 2023,positive,aquaman and the lost kingdom is a worthy sequel and has more of what everyone liked about the first film rest in peace dceu
Dec 24 2023,negative,whoever wrote the script must have been drunk the plot is mediocre at best the final scene was just bizarre and a clear iron man 1 ripoff dont pay money to watch wait until this becomes rentable or debuts on streaming
Dec 24 2023,positive,felt something something was missing but overall an enjoyable experience great effects a bit thin on the story fun
Dec 24 2023,positive,amazing movie i recommended it
Dec 24 2023,negative,man ive never felt compelled to ask for a refund from a movie before until aquaman2  of course i didnt ask for it but from the getgo this movie was not good and it never got any better  the storyline was muddled and predictable  the acting was mediocre  the cgi was economyclass  just one big disappointment
Dec 24 2023,positive,an enjoyable popcorn movie was it thought provoking no the lead actors make it enjoyable and it is a fun escape for a few hours
Dec 24 2023,positive,it was a good entertaining movie

Dec 24 2023,positive,the movie was awesome
Dec 24 2023,positive,in my opinion what a way to finish the du universe wonder what the next chapter of dc will look like in 2025
Dec 24 2023,positive,good movie and lots of action the storyline was okay and the villain we did not think his acting was any good
Dec 24 2023,negative,from the first minute you could tell all the movie cares about is propagandizing climate change  its a boring movie with barely any laughs
Dec 24 2023,positive,i thought that the first half of the movie was very slow and the last half picked up
Dec 24 2023,neutral,amazing cast wasted on a lackluster movie  its pretty there were people doing good work    just not the writers    worth a watch if you want to finish out the old dcu imho
Dec 24 2023,positive,very cool lots of action and a great brotherfamily  story
Dec 24 2023,positive,awesome movie but aquaman is due for a new enemy
Dec 24 2023,positive,this movie was really good my first time leaving a review and im here because the rating was low and i dont know why it almost made me not want to watch the movie but im glad i still came

Dec 24 2023,positive,awesome fun family movie
Dec 24 2023,positive,if youre a dc fan youve got to see this movie it was great dont listen to the critics go see it
Dec 24 2023,negative,worst ending wth was that build up then boom finished walked oot last 15 mins to go worst film up there next to the marvels
Dec 24 2023,negative,what happened  this movie was terrible  wait until it streams for free its not worth wasting money on
Dec 24 2023,negative,yet once again dc seems to show why marvel is king thank god the dceu is done and this movie was a perfect mark it wasnt that bad but yeah nothing you take serious sorry not a rewatch for me
Dec 24 2023,positive,if you like the first movie then youll enjoy this sequel i think its definitely worth a watch the underwater scenes were pretty colorful and cool
Dec 24 2023,positive,excellent movie could definitely watch again
Dec 24 2023,positive,not as good as the first one but its definitely not as bad as all the negative reviews are giving it  i saw it in 3d which is the way to go in my opinion  movie is definitely worth a watch in theaters
Dec 24 2023,positive,this is the reason i never listen to critics they are paid to critique a movie not just enjoy it this movie was very enjoyable and full of action and funny same it ends like this but will definitely buy on 4k to enjoy in my house
Dec 24 2023,positive,visually it was good some decent humor  the story was mostly predictable but did have a few surprise elements  parts felt choppy which could be from the rewrites reshoots etc  it passed the time just fine but did start slow the 2nd half was much more enjoyable than the beginning not the best dc movie but far from the worst
Dec 24 2023,negative,not great but super good effects and cgi i look the underwater look 
Dec 24 2023,negative,as bad as can be expected from a movie that is basically abandoned by everyone involved the supposed theme carried over from the first part being the world is getting destroyed and no one does anything about it fits perfectly since thats dceu the movie is just a backtoback montage of colourful cgi underwater worlds with lore always being expositioned like a recap episode of an animated series there is no focus on pretty much anything at all here meras role being cut down is noticeable but they also added just enough at convenient moments to point out and say that they didnt and one scene with the kid and her must be very intentional the movie tries to sell momoa and wilson as the thor and loki of this universe with personalities reversed and even references that directly but doesnt really have the same effect at all theres enough stuff here to keep you looking at the screen but never enough to be actually interested in it as a whole
Dec 24 2023,positive,my kids and i loved it good mix of action crazy funny stuff nice visual effects and straightforward story telling even the kids got it right away  aquaman 1 still better but this one doesnt fall too short hope to see more of jason momoa and the redr of the cast in the future 
Dec 24 2023,positive,great in 3 d cinematography awesome
Dec 24 2023,negative,movie sucks and rating on here is wrong no one like this movie 78  yeah right who pay them to give a high rating
Dec 24 2023,positive,a solid entry to end the dceu could have been better with how the movie was edited but overall great action
Dec 24 2023,positive,dont believe the critics great sequel great story loved all the one liners looking forward to seeing it again and owning it
Dec 24 2023,positive,amazing warner bros did such good work the graphics and storyline the sound production hope theres a part 3 to this
Dec 24 2023,positive,i loved it fast paced action movie  they met expectations and it was a great follow up to the first aquaman movie   it was like reading a great comic book  it kept interest and audience invested  the movie is great for the whole family
Dec 24 2023,positive,my rating for this movie is ok
Dec 24 2023,positive,fun movie that delivers what you want out of what is very much a comic book movie is it the best one ive seen no but it was a lot of fun and i laughed and had a good time long live topo
Dec 24 2023,positive,it was funnt and action packed with great family lessons but i believe there were too many characters involved
Dec 24 2023,positive,awesome i love any dc movie so may be a little bias with my review but love what theyve done with the aquaman movies and will definitely see it again
Dec 24 2023,positive,i wish that dc universe would continue because we still need victor stones back story i hope james gunn give us something spectacular aquaman 2 was awesome being the last movie in this dc phase id go watch it again
Dec 24 2023,positive,i will say that the show started off a little slow and the premise of the baby having aquatic powers was quite a reach but the second half of the movie was awesome this story seem to solidify and the trace comedies of the first half of the show were gone replaced by more seriousness which i deeply appreciated
Dec 24 2023,positive,good effects way better than flashbut thats easy i think it was ok for dc to close the year with this film was ok
Dec 24 2023,positive,i love this movie not a perfect ending for the dceu but it is a great close to aquamans saga excellent sequel
Dec 24 2023,positive,aquaman and the lost kingdom certainly is entertaining and worth seeing at least in theaters however there are a couple of inexcusable story beats and the film is deeply flawed in general
Dec 24 2023,negative,the super hero boredom is really setting in  unless dc and marvel are willing to work on writing good and interesting stories this cash cow is going to dry up  the last several years has bee bad for both dc and marvel  no apparent direction in these movies and no seeming point  im going to kill aquaman and all of his family was their big plot line  i meanreally  this was your big idea for aquaman  yikes  yes its as bad as it sounds
Dec 24 2023,positive,i liked the movie the effects and really how you can relate to it
Dec 24 2023,positive,it was alright i quite enjoyed the first film but rarely revisit it so that tells me something ill revisit this second one even less some bits were pretty dismal with the humor falling flat and some of the cgi is ropey as hell but the film has heart especially when the brothers are actually working together the best bit for me so overall it was alright compared to the rest of the rubbish that came out this year its pretty high on the watchable list the bestish of a very bad bunch 35
Dec 24 2023,negative,overthetop predictable story  really awful dialogue
Dec 24 2023,positive,good story and average action

Dec 24 2023,positive,story plot delivers lots of action  special effects  really gives you a thrill ride
Dec 24 2023,positive,easy watching good fight scenes and the story moved along well
Dec 24 2023,negative,these fan ratings have to be fake because this is the most boring superhero movie i have seen and  truly the least enjoyable  i have seen every marvel and dc movie and yes this was worse than the flash  it felt like no one was trying and the just mailed it in  the only positive thing i can say about the movie was the song at the end credits was good  everything from the cgi and fight scenes to story plot to costumes to main villain just terrible the dialogue was completely cheesy  all in all a huge snooze fest  i actually fell asleep at one point waiting for it to end
Dec 24 2023,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed this film i only gave it 4 stars because there were a few moments i felt like the acting was a bit corny but other than that i liked it alot
Dec 24 2023,positive,it completely stands on its own without any fanfare wonderful cinematography great storyline believable fight scenes its really good
Dec 24 2023,negative,great acting from the leads effects were decent the editing was choppy which led to a eclectic series of scenes with little to no development outside of the main story arc
Dec 24 2023,positive,the storyline was great they could have expounded on it more and added more action scenes overall good movie though id see it again
Dec 24 2023,positive,the visual effects were excellent  jason moma as always a great actor this aquaman was even with great action i really enjoyed it
Dec 24 2023,positive,all the negative pr tries to ruin an entertaining spectacular and really fun movie ignore the critics and go watch it on the biggest screen near you
Dec 24 2023,positive,is this an entertaining movie yes anything to change to make it better yes the opening is very week and silly freeing his brother from jail would have been much better the ending was dull and need changing the movie should have ended with the baby talking to the fishes in the aquarium tank
Dec 24 2023,positive,good action good comedydecent end to dceu era
Dec 24 2023,positive,amazing fight scenes and every character gets to shine

Dec 24 2023,negative,just please stop and stop hiring courtroom liars

Dec 24 2023,positive,awesome movie we need the 3rd movie asap
Dec 24 2023,positive,still cant get used to dcs graphics after seeing what marvel can do sorry dc
Dec 24 2023,positive,even tho i enjoyed watching it there was definitely very little build up to the climax and at times momoas acting was extremely unprofessional it seemed like he was having too much fun and not really vibing with the character he was playing i think everyone else took their roles seriously and they deserve credit for their hard work so im gonna go ahead and give it the 5 stars for effort
Dec 24 2023,negative,nothing original silly dialogue silly plot wait till you can stream it
Dec 24 2023,positive,i found the film to be entertaining and worth the money spent for admission i took into effect all the negativity the critics had about aquamanbut i thought the story plot made sense didnt have a problem with the cgi and even the comedy was enjoyable see it for yourself and make your own opinion
Dec 24 2023,positive,aquaman 2 is a very fun and entertaining sequel and even if you havent seen the first one its very easy to understand the plot
Dec 24 2023,positive,james wan never disappoints aquaman 2 is just as good as the first with the only difference being that jason momoa plays a more clownish version of his character some of the jokes didnt work for me at all but otherwise a great adventure movie
Dec 24 2023,negative,went in with low expectations and it still disappointed entire movie was very predictable jokes were tired horrible cgi save your money and wait to stream for free
Dec 24 2023,positive,awesome humor and action
Dec 24 2023,positive,with the final entry in a tumultuous ride that began with zack snyders man of steel james wans aquaman and the lost kingdom did a great job of leaving on a high note fun ride overall
Dec 24 2023,positive,the graphic is great though the script only for someone who was not looking for some deep movies   note i really do not like the king he just jokes immoderately
Dec 24 2023,positive,very entertaining action packed with humor and special effects
Dec 24 2023,positive,this movie is really fun to watch the critics and some hardcore fans are full of it ending the dceu is still a bad idea and i will never thank or forgive wb for ruining it by rushing into it

Dec 24 2023,positive,nothing new dont spend your money at the theaters  3 stars is a gift
Dec 24 2023,neutral,a very average run of the mill superhero sequel with an overstuffed story but jason momoas charismatic performance and moments of creativity keep aquaman and the lost kingdom from sinking entirely

Dec 24 2023,positive,i like it some funny stuff now i want to see whats next if he will have another baby
Dec 24 2023,positive,i am convinced that most movie critics hate dc movies  aquaman 2 is better than the first movie the storytelling is solid and easy to follow there are no dangling or nonsensical plotlines jason mamoa is playing jason mamoa but thats nothing new or unexpected patick wilson as ocean master gets some really good character development and even some really good comedic bits along with the character dr shin who was barely shown in the first movie but get s alot more screentime here this is a solid family friendly superhero flick with a lot of action and good cgi
Dec 24 2023,neutral,while i wasnt really looking forward to this sequel i did not expect all the hate it was receiving it was hard to ignore the amount of early reviews absolutely bashing this film and while i cant say i liked aquaman and the lost kingdom i dont hate it  the chemistry is great the comedy is solid the action is decent and theres a good sense of fun adventure  that said the editing is atrocious the effects are terrible the soundtrack is awful and the film overexplains a lot  im not saying its great i would even hesitate to call it a good film but i would say it was fun enough to be completely passable i was mentally preparing myself for a twohour trainwreck and honestly ive seen a lot worse
Dec 24 2023,positive,the previews dont do it justice  cgi is off the hook loved the story line  i really did enjoy this film
Dec 24 2023,positive,it was funny entertaining and funny  and jason is always nice to look at  the theater was really dirty didnt look like it had been cleaned in awhile there was popcorn etc in front of on and behind the seats
Dec 24 2023,positive,keeping it spoiler free and will say that this film was a whole lot of fun jason momoas energy makes aquaman a fun and lovable character great action sequences and honestly a pretty cool fantasy like story while i dont think it is better than the 1st film it does manage to be just as good do yourself a favor and go see this movie
Dec 24 2023,positive,great family movie  action packed   family love and good humor aquaman
Dec 24 2023,negative,horrible why did they even bother to make this
Dec 24 2023,positive,this is a great movie funny to watch visually and from a story standpoint  revenge looms large and drives this movie through the waters ways of this world  brothers unite for the great cause
Dec 24 2023,positive,action packed funny moments

Dec 24 2023,positive,loved it if you liked the first movie than you will enjoy this one
Dec 24 2023,positive,i thought the story line would have had a better twist
Dec 24 2023,positive,similar to the flash in the aquaman and the lost kingdom one can sense the original essence of the film and the brilliance it could have achieved under minimal conditions james wan tries to salvage the movie with his distinctive touch its evident which parts of the film stem from his ideas these elements are precisely where the movie shines the most
Dec 24 2023,neutral,this movie was good for what it is a comic book move and i enjoyed it i really did but man glad to be done with the old dceu with this movie looking forward to the new slate of dcu movies under james gunn but this one meh visually great but the story really was not good 
Dec 24 2023,positive,the villains are very weak and aquaman really does not use his powers it was entertaining but the need for a real  powerful villain throughout the  movie would have captured attention more than it did
Dec 24 2023,positive,not a perfect movie but still enjoyed it
Dec 24 2023,positive,good movie with core values
Dec 24 2023,negative,there is a reason why this movie was barely promoted predictable  long and drawn out continuity and editing issues where some things simply dont make sense im not normally  that stupid so i watched it twice the story is beyond predictable there is some visual coolness to this movie but cmon there will be no aquaman 3
Dec 24 2023,negative,yea skip this for streaming cause this movie is steaming the true villain in this film was the writers 
Dec 24 2023,positive,awesome sequel especially storyline just in time for the holidays  i appreciate it and actors were great too

Dec 24 2023,positive,fun silly entertaining
Dec 24 2023,positive,if you enjoyed the first film you will enjoy this one i think the critics forget that this is supposed to be a fun story about a comic book character perhaps they could have dialed some of the frat boy antics down a bit then again at 53 im no longer the target audience for a superhero movie even so the film still achieved higher heights than i thought it would go see it
Dec 24 2023,positive,this was a fun film it was not ground breaking and i would not tell people to stop what they are doing to watch it however i did smile a couple times on a few parts there was a really cool fight sequence in particular that had me fired up i liked seeing more sea creatures be used in the film the back and forth between arthur and orm i enjoyed as well it should not be ranked so low by critics i understand it was not ground breaking im just writing a review saying that low of a score i feel is too low and was rated unfair
Dec 24 2023,positive,we liked the movie a lot it had action and the right amount of humor we didnt know what to expect but we were entertained
Dec 24 2023,positive,i loved this movie great effects and interesting plot worth watching more than once obsessed

Dec 24 2023,positive,ending couldve been better just lazy writing
Dec 24 2023,negative,a mediocre film and an appropriate goodbye to a lackluster dceu good riddance
Dec 24 2023,positive,way over the top inconsistent actingdirecting and direction of storyline thankfully it was only 2 hrs cmon dc youve got a great story comics aquaman but consistently fail in telling it how many explosions does it take to tell a good story
Dec 24 2023,positive,this is an example of a company who did not have their act together this is the last dceu movie and it ended the way they handled the whole franchise
Dec 24 2023,neutral,it was much more dark than the first movie which i really enjoyed  wouldnt watch it again
Dec 24 2023,positive,a little corny in parts good fight scenes and jason looks amazing as usual

Dec 24 2023,positive,its definitely not as bad as people claim it to be solid fun action adventure has its problems but overall its a good time
Dec 24 2023,negative,i wanted this to be a good movie i loved the first movie this was just a major borefest
Dec 24 2023,negative,another popcorn movie like the first one we were hoping it to be better than the first one but it isnt this movie is stream worthy maybe no new worthy characters were introduced doesnt aquaman have a rogue gallery of villains plenty of action scenes but they were pretty basic except for the end fight scene with bm and a the big baddy was taken out as a if he was a npc jason was being jason cgi looked worse than the first movie the critics got it right with this one
Dec 24 2023,positive,it was entertaining fun had some good homey family bits special effects worked well in this very otherworldly ambiance  mamoa played the character quite well with a lot of fun and enjoyment  really nice if he could keep on in the role
Dec 24 2023,positive,good storyline  hits home and shows how brothers working together is better than against each other
Dec 24 2023,neutral,a degradation of the characters and the story in dc since aquaman 1 thanks to hamada and with the help of influencers  a mix of fast and furious with thor love thunder  bad effects and a very garish color palette
Dec 24 2023,negative,save your  for when its streaming i cannot fathom how easily people give out 7080 scores much like ww84 didnt live up as a sequel this one fails even more actingbad storybad costumesbad special effectssolid humormissed more than hit
Dec 24 2023,positive,far better than the rt rating distracting with a nice relationship between the brothers and family heard has only 23 lines but who cares

Dec 23 2023,positive,saw it this afternoon with the family  we loved it  better than aquaman 1
Dec 23 2023,positive,ok so total transparency i did not expect anything from this movie but after giving it the shot it deserves i actually like it the storyline is good and engaging now if youre into superhero movies and youve been holding on to this ship like youre on the titanic you know some of the last releases are just rough this movie is a refreshing reminder that superhero fatigue maybe hasnt totally consumed us there are some beautiful landscapes and some really awesome designed creatures the fishermen were amazing i love the hints of wans horror elements now there are some things that im like ehhh as with the first one the chemistry between mamoa and heard just isnt there they both do a great job with their characters but together im not buying it  there are moments where the cg looks rough but easily looked over dont listen to the critics this movie speaking as a fan is the best superhero movie to come out lately
Dec 23 2023,positive,choreography for fight scenes was 1010
Dec 23 2023,positive,it was pretty solid for the final dceu movie now the villain motives changed quickly which just defeats the whole purpose luckily no one died so that was good and good humor when needed not bad

Dec 23 2023,positive,thats an amazing movie with incredible characters and effects its a great superhero movie

Dec 23 2023,positive,i love it jason momoa is always a joy to watch

Dec 23 2023,positive,i liked the action and plot i didnt like some of the juvenile humor
Dec 23 2023,positive,loved it glad they brought the brother back
Dec 23 2023,positive,the critics have no idea what theyre talking about this movie was great it really has been better than the majority of marvel movies minus guardians within the past few years story was great and no pandering was needed or done  i know people are upset about heard but dont let her ruin your good time
Dec 23 2023,positive,was apprehensive after seeing the critics reviews decided to see it anyway and so glad we did was bloody brilliant 
Dec 23 2023,positive,dont listen to hearsay or rotten tomatoes if you enjoyed part 1 this easily just as good if not better good main character good villain and stayed in context to its continuity
Dec 23 2023,positive,super fun and entertaining holiday movie ignore the critics and just go have fun

Dec 23 2023,positive,i like this film i consider it a fun and exciting film even with a known formula it was not the same as always a good dose of action and the relationship with a global problem like global warming and momoa plays a great role as aquaman even with the end of the dceu he should continue in the role
Dec 23 2023,positive,i thought it was alright movie it isnt anything special its just your typical superhero film i did like the action and the story was okay
Dec 23 2023,positive,was an ok popcorn movie visuals were good started off pretty slow but 2nd half was better story was ok but nothing surprising or epic worth a watch
Dec 23 2023,positive,liked the whole movie from start your finish it was action
Dec 23 2023,positive,thouhgt the movie was really good
Dec 23 2023,positive,while definitely a bit messier and only serving a standalone sequel aquaman 2 is still a funny action film thanks to momoas and wilsons chemistry
Dec 23 2023,positive,i came in not expecting much but i was pleasantly surprised it wasnt the best movie ive seen not even close but also not the worst even though i applaud their effort almost every character felt underdeveloped and the story was underwhelming the character development of orm the bad guy of the first movie and aquamans half brother and dr stephen shin a scientist played by randall park carried the movie if youre a fan of dc or movies its worth your time but otherwise i wouldnt watch it
Dec 23 2023,positive,i thought it was awesome
Dec 23 2023,negative,i dont know when the american movie industry started to fail its defenetly part of it
Dec 23 2023,positive,this is a great movie dont know why the critics are killing it is a funny movie with great action sequences and an ok story and plot line but jason momoa an patrick wilson makes this movie an enjoyable ride

Dec 23 2023,negative,absolutely tragic scenes were too short with unnecessarily dramatic music and numerous failed attempts at comedy
Dec 23 2023,positive,i honestly do not understand the critics ratings this was a fun and enjoyable movie
Dec 23 2023,positive,i absolutely loved this movie i just love jason momoa as aquaman because hes having such a great time that as an audience member its hard to also not having a great time watching him
Dec 23 2023,negative,pure wan garbagesave your clam shells
Dec 23 2023,positive,i loved it i enjoyed how they explored the brothers    relationship as well as arthur as a father i will definitely watch it again

Dec 23 2023,positive,thats was amazing dc universe
Dec 23 2023,positive,good movie to watch with the kids the story couldve have been just a tad better
Dec 23 2023,positive,this was a joyous surprise  full of environmental issues family and some good humor  you can tell jason momoa was a cowriter  what a fun movie to end out the year
Dec 23 2023,positive,a very enjoyable time with better action comedy and tension than the first im sure people who liked the 1st movie will enjoy this one more
Dec 23 2023,negative,the first one was so good that i wud say it was best dc superhero movie ever made  this was so awful and some scenes unwatchable  it was 2 hrs long but felt like a total blur and complete waste of time for me  maybe total dc reboot is not a bad idea after all but i wont hold my breath
Dec 23 2023,negative,terrible movie mish mash of scenes poor acting effect were weak 
Dec 23 2023,negative,the film itself is a 05 to 15 stars at best and that is being generous the film is quite predictable and the story itself is boring i would have liked to give this film higher ratings but i couldnt the movie doesnt move the story any further at all is like you can predict the whole story since the beginning of the film and theres no point of watching it i only went to watch it because its the first film ever that im seeing from wb that showings in imax 3d the seats were empty compares to the marvels imax 3d showing when i went to watch the marvels it was basically almost full with a few seats remain opening but this one is basically empty she was in this film which was a bummer and i thought she would dieand that would have been a whole point of watching the film is to see her characters dies unfortunately she doesnt and i think the studio is definitely planning to keep her in future films that alone makes me not watch the upcoming films anymore and worse of all no one dies whatsoever on the heros side its like theres no risks when it comes to this film and the cgii dont know i dont get why every single time they make a cgi baby its scary af like come on honestly i have given chance and chance to wb and their films but all i got in returns was let down and disappointments well for me thats enough from wb ive given wb too many chances to redeem themselves but looks like theyre going down a path much worse than what disneymarvel is taking its a pretty dark and sad path this may be my last film that i will be watching from wb about heroes and villains i wont be attending future superhero films until things changes well see ill be watching from afar i forgot to add people actually walked out and never return
Dec 23 2023,positive,i liked all the actions
Dec 23 2023,positive,it was amazing the graphics and just jason momoa humor as usually keeps you on your toes i loved the movie i hope to see another one soon
Dec 23 2023,positive,fun movie definitely not as bad as everyone said it was
Dec 23 2023,positive,not bad cant imagine anyone more perfect to have played aquaman than jason mamoa
Dec 23 2023,positive,not bad for a sequel pacing can be slow in some places but overall its an entertaining film not many explosions compare to the first one at least sad that this is the end to dceu felt like fantastic beasts where there is no conclusion at all wb really needs to pull their strings together
Dec 23 2023,positive,the movie is really good it is not wow but considering the mishmash that warner is going through james wan has done a great job the man had to change the things several times so he deserves respect on what he has achieved the effects are good and the movie is entertaining and has a good pace
Dec 23 2023,positive,it was an amazing movie and i recommend watching it it was fantastic with no negativesjust watch this amazing film
Dec 23 2023,positive,there were some good moments but a lot of the humor really took away from the momentum they were trying to build as soon as i heard the first dont call me brother i groaned because i knew to expect not only that exchange to repeated multiple times but that it would end in them acknowledging that they are brothers
Dec 23 2023,positive,fantastic conclusion to aquaman funny and adventure loved it
Dec 23 2023,positive,absolutely loved it  the best superhero movie of the year no doubt the cinematography cgi action sequence all were amazing yes they did changed arthurs character to more comedic side which i didnt like i prefer zacks version of his character overall ill give it 8510  rotten tomatoes scores are biased as usual so dont care for their reviews jude yourself
Dec 23 2023,negative,the technical aspects are interesting and the main characters are fairly charming but the story was predictable and well boring you really have to be an aquaman or dcu fanatic to enjoy this one
Dec 23 2023,positive,forget the haters and remember that this is a sequel not the goodbye everyone feels it should be it is just as enjoyable as the first
Dec 23 2023,positive,i liked the redemption arc and family connecting arc that the movie took was it as good as the first no but it was still a good movie
Dec 23 2023,negative,had a bad feeling going into this film and my feelings were right  actors looked bored cgi was over the top bland story and i found several of the characters annoying  bad scripts cannot be cured by more cgi  people were laughing at parts that were not meant to be humorous which is a sure sign movie has failed
Dec 23 2023,negative,pathetic very bored i left the movie theater before it was over
Dec 23 2023,positive,cgi aside i loved this movie
Dec 23 2023,positive,i wouldnt want to spoil the surprises but if you have been following the aquaman series you will love it
Dec 23 2023,positive,i had fun with this one definitely worth a watch if you liked the first one this one should put a smile on your face really enjoyed the characters especially the villain true standout belongs to mamoa and wilson but everyone had a good role to play
Dec 23 2023,positive,the movie turned out great the movie is a very beautiful and interesting adventure film mamoas performance is to be admired arthur and orms brotherly relationship is shown brilliantly
Dec 23 2023,positive,its okay its worth at least one watch but i dont think id watch it again
Dec 23 2023,positive,really stunning movie it kept you on your toes
Dec 23 2023,positive,i would have given it more but the 30 mins of god damn previews was horrible i almost left before the movie started because i got bored before the movie even started
Dec 23 2023,negative,absolutely one of the worst movies i have ever sat through
Dec 23 2023,positive,very good a little slow in the beginning but amazing end great way to end the dceu jason you will be missed
Dec 23 2023,negative,trash and they have the liar all in it
Dec 23 2023,positive,its a very similar movie to the first 1 but better
Dec 23 2023,neutral,momma was great but the movie still lacks the excitement needed to take it up to superman status
Dec 23 2023,positive,good movie with a intro stemming from the first movie enjoyed the graphics and ending left me skeptical of what the next one will show
Dec 23 2023,negative,they removed batman boo
Dec 23 2023,positive,the movie gets a three rating purely based on all the different eye candy that there was to see throw in some comedic relief cgi was also done well  other than that it was awful acting awful story could have so much better directing awful editing awful i can keep going with the awful but ill stop here
Dec 23 2023,positive,the story is not great but good nice cinematography and cgi effects are worth it
Dec 23 2023,positive,the movie is very entertaining it clearly fails in its continuity and in that the story is like a world fact leaving aside the other superheroes as if they did not exist and of course the purpose of this universe but in general it is entertaining decent the cgi
Dec 23 2023,positive,i loved the movie it had everything thanks jason for another one  my family are glad we went to see you on screen 
Dec 23 2023,neutral,feels halfhearted insignificant in the grand scheme of things that is the dceu
Dec 23 2023,positive,the movie was funny and action packed not a whole lot that i didnt like just a few minor things
Dec 23 2023,negative,aquaman and the lost kingdom is a terrible film not even the visuals save it dc studios was stillborn and stillborn
Dec 23 2023,negative,audience score is a scam nobody in their right mind would score this more than 4
Dec 23 2023,positive,maybe i enjoy bad superhero movies maybe im one of the few movie goers that isnt sick of the overflow of superhero moviesshows whatever the reason is i enjoyed this movie    keeping it spoiler free aquaman 2 was action packed and had some memorable moments unfortunately it tried to follow the marvel formula of comedy in comic adaptation movies but it was nothing too cringe worthy i would like to see aquaman be a bit more serious though as i dont quite remember him being that much of a jokester in any of the comic runs ive read     the overall theme of family was okay it was cool to see orm in action and i loved every action scene with mera her powers are too awesome to completely right her off the script     some parts felt a bit rushed and i wished they spent more time developing certain characters and themes but overall a fun enjoyable movie that i would love to see again and breakdown a bit further
Dec 23 2023,positive,great storyline  always love jasons humor
Dec 23 2023,positive,movie was great continue from the first movie
Dec 23 2023,positive,the theater was actually closed for remodeling so i didnt get to watch it could i get a refund on my tickets please
Dec 23 2023,negative,oof the end of the dceu was  something  can i get a refund on my ticket
Dec 23 2023,positive,the movie was just ok the tandem of jason momoa and patrick wilson is a delight which draws inspiration from late 80s buddy cop action films however the film shouldve trimmed down the loony comic banter and the goofiness of the titular character     oh there goes the dceu thanks a lot studio execs past and present for years of chasing the competition than innovation
Dec 23 2023,positive,dont understand the critical hate with this film  this was just as good as the first and exceeds in many ways    i definitely want this version of the atlantean family to continue
Dec 23 2023,neutral,it wasnt anything too different than any other justice league or marvel movie
Dec 23 2023,negative,the cgi is obviously top tier but it feels like the film was held up entirely by cgi and nothing else the movie excluding credits is under 2hrs but the terrible pacing made the movie felt 10 times longer than that unnecessary amount of flashbacks being forced into the movie just distrupts the flow    overall if youre a dc fan worth watching but definitely nothing memorable
Dec 23 2023,negative,waste of time and money
Dec 23 2023,positive,movie had its flaws but it was alright for me
Dec 23 2023,positive,movie made me laugh made me care for what the characters do next yes there is alot of cgi in the film but its core story about family pushes its message throughout the film i would see it again
Dec 23 2023,positive,as the movie started i was thinking this sucks another marvels or flash movie i was pleasantly surprised the movie got better by the mid credit scene i had completely changed my mind its a very enjoyable movie
Dec 23 2023,positive,we enjoyed watching aquaman on the big screen in 3d jasons personality shines on every character he plays the story line is good and open for a return visit to see how atlantis is thriving
Dec 23 2023,positive,you dont have any boring moments but sometimes things people or weapons just appear next to the action characters lol
Dec 23 2023,positive,is not a bad movie better than the marvels
Dec 23 2023,positive,this movie was fantastic i recommend ityou must see itit is not a perfect movie but it s a really good moviewhere you can go with your familyi really liked it
Dec 23 2023,negative,boring boring boring
Dec 23 2023,positive,basic but good i dont know how to explain the vfx made it better
Dec 23 2023,positive,the delays actually might have helped because there is a lot of improvement over the first movie besides building on top of it if you liked the first one this is a must watch  james wan has an eye for detail and this is full of it
Dec 23 2023,positive,personally i enjoyed it more than the first instalment it was a fun creative joyful movie albeit flawed in certain aspects but i have no regrets watching it in the cinema and would absolutely recommend its a great time
Dec 23 2023,positive,didnt like it  too busy same last second saving heroics common theme the only good thing was the ending pass  wouldve rather watched wonka
Dec 23 2023,positive,i went in with low expectations but was pleasantly surprised the movie focuses heavily on the family aspect but manages to pack some not all of the characters full of nuance and detail that are a joy to watch    not sure if all of the sfx will age well though
Dec 23 2023,negative,the most boring movie i have ever had the misfortune of watching just terrible
Dec 23 2023,positive,typical sequel took what they did with the first film did it again in a shorter run time the faster pace sacrifices the weight of the story at times and leaves us with a more campy arthur than before the supporting cast delivers and adds a counterbalance to that the lost kingdomancient history aspect is always fun and interesting dynamic  action great designs beautiful visuals round out an enjoyable action flick
Dec 23 2023,positive,great visuals brilliant fight scenes story is meh but okay
Dec 23 2023,positive,the critics suck the movie its good a popcorn movie decent action
Dec 23 2023,positive,i had very low expectations of this movie but i kinda enjoyed it   aquaman 1 was way better and is a superhero classic this isnt   i honestly enjoyed the flash movie more than this but this is still an ok watch
Dec 23 2023,positive,not as good as the first one but still a solid film
Dec 23 2023,positive,best actions and 3d experience  most enjoyable film easily recommended
Dec 23 2023,positive,the aquaman and the lost kingdom wow    the dceus last and last film  the franchise we hoped for future is now a lost kingdom its abandoned the final film aquaman 2 did a great job even though the movie has passed so many problems james wan gave us the best he could  character writing for orm and manta was incredibly amazing and i loved mera   best ending
Dec 23 2023,positive,we watched aquaman 2 in 4d and it was pretty amazing we really enjoyed it they made good use of the villian in this movie which seems to be lacking these days in other movies there was some cringey dialog i will admit it was a fun time out with the family i would definitely recommend seeing it in 4d the experience of that in and of itself adds extra intensity dont forget to pick up your 3d glasses before the show
Dec 23 2023,negative,the dcu ended on a dud its hard to point out everything that went wrong horrible dialog terrible editing kidman and momoa looked like they didnt want to be there at times cheap cgi disjointed story   its easier to say what went well the popcorn i ate while watching it thats it oh and i liked the sonicwhale scene which hearkened to early comics aquaman   seriously how does dc botch nearly everything in the movie it wasnt worse than flash but thats not saying much
Dec 23 2023,neutral,not the worst dceu film butcertainly not the best no storyline corn jokes boring first act overall it was entertaining with the  action set pieces  it was enough to keep me slightly invested and awake rip dceu  bring on the gunn verse
Dec 23 2023,negative,dont waste your money or your time
Dec 23 2023,positive,the jokes were not that funnythe story line was good and the actors were convincingthe movie filming was average
Dec 23 2023,positive,very entertaining had so much fun
Dec 23 2023,positive,from all the bad reviews ive seen i have to honestly disagree with them i actually liked the film it wasnt better than the first one but i was still entertained and i enjoyed it i thought it was really good
Dec 23 2023,positive,funny entertaining story was not amazing but not bad
Dec 23 2023,positive,happy ending for aquamans family good cgi and action fight
Dec 23 2023,positive,weak villain story built slowly comedic attempts werent timed well
Dec 23 2023,positive,movie was great definitely seeing it again 
Dec 23 2023,positive,i was a huge fan of the first aquaman and with the second one i had a great time the action was great and the visuals were stunning the humor i didnt find corny at all and had some laughs with great popcorn movie and worth getting out of the house to go see
Dec 23 2023,positive,i loved the story of the movie and also the brotherly bond with aquaman and his brother but it was no different to lokis and thors relationship to me the story was just a re telling of thor the dark world a story of 2 half brothers were the youngest brother gets thrown in prison for something he messed up in the kingdom the rulers now dont want anyone to release him but since he needs his help the older one bracks the law and bracks the youngest out anyways and the once villain youngest halfbrother turns good
Dec 23 2023,negative,i cant remember the last movie i walked out before seeing the end  this is a ridiculous movie and a total waste of time  lucky we were able to sneak into the movie next to us
Dec 23 2023,neutral,it wasnt great or bad cgi was better than the flash but felt the marvels was better sorry its a bare pass
Dec 23 2023,positive,amazing i actually liked it better than the first one and i didnt think that was possible it was action filled just the right amount of humor and constantly kept you engaged and on your toes exceptional job
Dec 23 2023,neutral,fun leads and funny moments help a been there done that movie
Dec 23 2023,negative,dceu goes out with a wimper
Dec 23 2023,negative,it sucked in every capacity to even go into full explanation would be a waste of time for this one
Dec 23 2023,positive,aquaman the lost kingdom is a fantastic film that keeps you entertained and laughing story feels completed and cohesive a must see
Dec 23 2023,negative,imagine defaming someone who had all the concrete proof of you being an abuser stripped from work stripped from amazing movies to getting a slap to the hand and being in a major movie like aqua man the lost kingdomsuch a disappointment to see that

Dec 23 2023,positive,good movie just had a certain character in it that i didnt like
Dec 23 2023,positive,its not as good as the first movie but theres still a lot to like in this movie such as the environment and action jason momoa who i usually like is the weak link of the movie
Dec 23 2023,positive,interesting plot but very sketchy acting and more dependent upon special effects that a real story line  we all know aquaman but creating a film more about relationships would have been better in my opinion  it just was a little too      over the top  technical without real substance
Dec 23 2023,negative,kudos to the actors but seriously whats the deal with these storylines its like they tossed originality out the window and decided to drown everything in a sea of tired jokes and clichéd endings can we get a script makeover please

Dec 23 2023,positive,epic adventure jason momoa is aquaman the oneliners are on point great film to see this holiday with the family
Dec 23 2023,negative,first of all fuck fandango nobody is helpful why would you put a movie up to buy tickets for after the start time i obviously had purchased the tickets for the wrong time  day  i still got charged  then i tried to call after to see if i can change the dates that i mistakenly bought  they said no because the movie started like okay obviously i bought the wrong ticket to the movie   so whatever the theater is more helpful than actual fandango

Dec 23 2023,positive,it was an okay film wish they had killed off a certain someone who clearly doesnt belong in the film cgi was a little shoddy in spots only noticed one or two scenes where it seemedglitchy almost wasnt a fan of the constant whooping and hollering decent action scenes sometimes orm was good baby was cute probably worth seeing on discount day at the theater
Dec 23 2023,positive,this aquaman seems like they took the time to put together a good storyline my daughter and i really enjoyed it
Dec 23 2023,positive,it was fine for what it was i dont know what people expected i thought it was just as good as the first movie and tied things up rather well cgi is rediculous but it was the same in the first movie
Dec 23 2023,negative,sadly it is utterly ridiculous  i feel bad for the actors who had to do it  the whole concept is dumb and makes no sense   the first one was so good
Dec 23 2023,positive,it was a great movie hopefully the jason mamoa rendition of aquaman will continue on as this movie really allowed him to make the character shine
Dec 23 2023,negative,just super poor writing  effects were decent and that was it  plot elements were almost nonexistent  dialogue was terrible especially the comedy  antagonists were the poorest i have seen in a long while  i hope they dont make another i will not be going to see it if they do
Dec 23 2023,positive,the best superhero movie of the year without a doubt you cant miss it put aside the controversy and enjoy a good aquaman movie

Dec 23 2023,positive,i havent seen the movie but it has jason momoa my pookie bear in it so 1010
Dec 23 2023,neutral,it was pretty much what you saw in the previews with a cookie cutter script
Dec 23 2023,positive,good sequel it did not stink it was ok i was entertained
Dec 23 2023,positive,the movies cgi and effects were good about the same if not a tad better than the first movie the acting was good for the most part however it felt rushed i think thats what bothered me the most was i wanted more out of the story more than anything in my opinion the controversy with the actors and with hollywood as a whole the past couple of years have given way to half baked stories and terrible acting i give aquaman a 45 because they had the idea and the themes there it just wasnt finished and executed well enough the brother aspect of the story is what pushed me from a 34 stars if they can get the right script and casting as well as a good budget id like to see aquaman end as a trilogy
Dec 23 2023,positive,fx were almost perfect the story was convincente but could not avoid similiarities with lotr overall it was a good movie and a vindication for superhéroes movies that were so bad lately this is the comeback for aquaman in times where warner plans are uncertain
Dec 23 2023,positive,really good the family loved it only wish their wasnt a power outage and had to wait for the power to come back on

Dec 23 2023,positive,it was fine  good chemistry between jason momoa and patrick wilson really carried a lot of it  the action sequences were really well done including some really good close combat scenes  worth a watch

Dec 23 2023,positive,my son i ready in enjoy are self
Dec 23 2023,positive,exciting action packed truly great visuals one of the best movies of the year
Dec 23 2023,neutral,a lot of repetitive tropes

Dec 23 2023,positive,the movie was great the 3d effects are really good and it was action packed with some humor
Dec 23 2023,positive,not bad not as good as the first one but definitely better than some of the marvel films that have come out  354 stars
Dec 23 2023,negative,aquaman and the lost kingdom was a major letdown the humor unintentional as it was couldnt salvage a movie that felt like a halfhearted effort its as if the energy and enthusiasm that once drove the dceu has fizzled out leaving us with this underwhelming installment    the films quality is alarmingly poor making it evident that a revamp of dc films is not just necessary but urgent this sequel turns out to be a tedious and uninspired affair lacking the charm and vibrancy of its predecessor the original aquaman may not have been a masterpiece but it possessed a certain liveliness that is sorely missing here    moreover the decision to retain an actress with a history of abuse in the cast adds another layer of disappointment to the experience its disheartening to see such choices being made overshadowing any potential the film might have had in summary aquaman and the lost kingdom is a disappointing venture both in terms of cinematic quality and moral judgment
Dec 23 2023,positive,does a great job connecting and expanding on the original movie a fun time with nice moments about family jason momoa is aquamanand that is enough of a treat in and of itself see it on the big screen
Dec 23 2023,positive,it was a good movie decent plotstoryline and the special effects were great
Dec 23 2023,positive,action packed great story line very humorous great family flick

Dec 23 2023,positive,good movie with superhero touch
Dec 23 2023,positive,dont listen to rotten tomatoes it was good plenty of action and a good storyline honestly after hearing how bad this one may be i was genuinely surprised by how much we liked it
Dec 23 2023,positive,just saw aquaman and the lost kingdom and i loved it  jason mamoa put his personality a bit more into aquaman which was great i especially liked the return of his brother patrick wilson to the story go see for yourself if possible in 3d
Dec 23 2023,positive,i loved it i think better than first one
Dec 23 2023,positive,very fantastic must watch 3d movie underwater action is awesome great direction by james wan
Dec 23 2023,positive,there were some funny spots  the action was so so  the dialogue was really clunky  fortuantely saw it at a 500 per seat movie theatre  nowing what i know now i would wait for it to come out on a streaming service
Dec 23 2023,positive,i had so much fun the plot isnt terrible the cgi is pretty decent lots of action jason momoa being jason momoa and james wan direction with some horror touches is always very interesting
Dec 23 2023,positive,lots of action and great visuals aquaman did not disappoint
Dec 23 2023,negative,nothing new bloated uninspiring mess visuals are amazing though
Dec 23 2023,positive,dceu ends with a bang
Dec 23 2023,negative,it was so boring that a guy next to me in the movie theatre fell asleep 15min later during the movie also the storyline just felt really messy and rushed
Dec 23 2023,positive,i liked the action but  it was a flaw for me the the villain mantis  didnt do the final act himself  which made the ending so predictable that i began to lose interest
Dec 23 2023,negative,cringe dialogue nothing original or exciting in the plot cgi looks dated requisite fight scenes are only to substitute for a weak plot
Dec 23 2023,negative,i really wanted to like this film sadly though the biggest draw for me is jason momoa as aquaman considering this movie is called aquaman i dont get why he was the smallest part of it oh plus he is completely covered from the neck down  throughout the entire movie  with either long sleeves and a pants or his aquaman costumes  poor cgi way too busy fight scenes and a really dreadful script  i just cant bring myself to recommend this movie even with his handsome face in it
Dec 23 2023,negative,they need a new word for stupid after watching this movie
Dec 23 2023,positive,looks beautiful with amazing set designs feels rushed in the beginning but thankfully slows down has the deadpool 2 problem of doubling down on the first films highs making them extreme some of the acting is on point while others seem wooden or uninterested in the story
Dec 23 2023,negative,it looks even worse than the first one and didnt catch me at all why should i care about the main characters fate if he seems to feel the same    to end on a positive note therell be no 3rd one for a while
Dec 23 2023,positive,great movie if you want a funny upbeat superhero story it holds up to aquaman 1 and the music is truly iconic to this character at one point the cgi gets weird but you look past it with the story music acting and more then i think its worth your money if want a funny superhero movie instead of a intense drama biography that other movies have you should see aquaman you cant be disappointed when watching this movie
Dec 23 2023,positive,i really enjoyed it i am a comic book fan i would go again if i could
Dec 23 2023,positive,the movie was fun actionpacked and beautiful thank james wan for this amazing sequel
Dec 23 2023,neutral,disappointed i wanted to like it but the writing just wasnt good most of the jokes fell flat the story was predictable almost no chemistry between any of the actors dolph ludgrin was the lone actor to actually fulfill his role
Dec 23 2023,positive,very fun watch a bit anticlimactic but my girlfriend and i enjoyed the actors amazing cgi and journey of a plot definitely recommend for a date night or an outing with the family
Dec 23 2023,positive,i thought it was a really good movie highly entertaining and the story like and acting was super solid i enjoyed the relationship between the brothers aquaman and orm a lot too
Dec 23 2023,positive,excellent cinematography and great cast  it was a great continuation of the first movie
Dec 23 2023,negative,the movie is a mess and i have a duty to warn land dwellers james wan  dc failed again this saddened me because this will be the last time we see this aquaman i gave it 2 stars because the message to the audience teared me up at end or it would have gotten a 1 star word
Dec 23 2023,positive,farewell dceu aquaman and the lost kingdom ends what has been building up for more than 10 years without a bang but maybe thats for the best the burdens of heroism familyfatherhood and kingship are not light ones and arthur does a wonderful job bringing all of them into balance in this film by redeeming not only his greatest enemy but his brother its just not something you see much of in comicbook movies nowadays not only did it close the events of the previous film well but the ending was certainly a happy one and what more could fans ask jason mamoa and patrick wilson were a blast combined by their hefty atlantean crew and beyond the performances were enticing apart from jani zhaos character who felt oddly out of place apart from the slower start to the film some forcedcheesy jokes and writing the weird slow motion randomly thrown in shoddy sound editing at times and the tone taking quite a bit to settleaquaman and the lost kingdom was a comicbook visual spectacle bringing atlantis to life once again in even more ways than its previous film with a wellknown ruthless villain and a newer evil making for exciting james wan horror elements
Dec 23 2023,positive,a pretty decent adventure for the last of the dceu films
Dec 23 2023,positive,funny and plenty of actions  great pass time
Dec 23 2023,negative,unwatchable at any speed
Dec 23 2023,positive,we enjoyed it very much highly recommended
Dec 23 2023,positive,i found it super entertaining the final act is a bit of a let down but the visuals and momoas charisma carries the film
Dec 23 2023,positive,lots of fun great villain and lots of cool action that moved the story forward a good way to end aquamans reign and the dceu
Dec 23 2023,neutral,the movie was just ok
Dec 22 2023,positive,humorous fun exciting and thrilling but with heart  touched on current topics without overdoing it a nice fitting final movie in the dc extended universe 
Dec 22 2023,positive,great actionstarted off slowbut then had you on the edge of your seat would recommend to everyone
Dec 22 2023,negative,very slow in beginning aquaman appeared to be very childish we took turns sleeping it was very predictable
Dec 22 2023,positive,not a hateful movie but an underwhelming movie with some good moments time to make way for james gunns dc universe now
Dec 22 2023,positive,i thought that this movie was incredibly entertaining and it is a good sequal to the first it isnt high art but when it was emotional i felt it tear at me when it was funny i got energised and the action had me pumped and felt very creative i highly recommend seeing it with the awareness that your life wont be changed by it
Dec 22 2023,positive,not bad but they could have left out the fake global warming nonsense
Dec 22 2023,positive,fun movie and awesome villains but sad way to end the dceu
Dec 22 2023,negative,action packed but just plain silly and goofy movie
Dec 22 2023,positive,funny i thought for the state of the dceu it was fine
Dec 22 2023,positive,really great movie i really enjoyed the exploration of the brothers relationship and arthurs struggles with life and questioning his place as king lots of good humor as well
Dec 22 2023,positive,i was enjoying the movie it was very entertaining
Dec 22 2023,neutral,510 marvel does a better job with making superhero movies not as predictable for this its a predictable villain superhero movie that being said i enjoyed it i am a fan of the aquaman movies and you will enjoy it if you are too
Dec 22 2023,negative,this movie is a jumbled mess it takes so many scenes from other scifi movies that i had to remind myself of what movie i was watching the plot is worn out  too familiar a lot of swearing for a pg movie along with potty humor save your money on this one
Dec 22 2023,positive,loved it lots of exciting action  cgi and jason momoa delivers another fun version of aquaman
Dec 22 2023,positive,was enjoyable to watch fun
Dec 22 2023,negative,awful do not see it this film is not worth whatever hype people are giving it if you saw more then a 2 star rating from fans  those people would probably enjoy watching static on a tv
Dec 22 2023,negative,as the last movie before yet another dc reboot guess they decided to save money and make a movie without a storyline let before the end wish i had left before the beginning
Dec 22 2023,positive,was decent action  terrible acting in places of course they have to add in theory wole message of climate changemid credit scene was bizzare
Dec 22 2023,positive,super fun superhero action adventure flick
Dec 22 2023,positive,amazing fight sequences the fleshed out the relationships and made me feel for the characters the story line was a bit weak i loved orm in this
Dec 22 2023,negative,i went to see it because all the commotion about the movie only 2 stars because the under the sea scenes better from the little mermaid and the fights loks better from the last star wars movies and shows but told jason mamoa he can act they lie to him
Dec 22 2023,positive,its really action packed great performance  awesome visual effects good to see the bond between family
Dec 22 2023,positive,this movie surprised me with all the down hype ive seen to be a fairly entertaining movie and deserves more people to go see it
Dec 22 2023,positive,not a big fan of sequels but this movie made a big splash amazing action packed film better than the first film in my opinion
Dec 22 2023,negative,i walked out maybe my expectations were too high but holy  i saw the whole movie in 30 minutes and weighed whether i wanted to sit through awful cgi for the next 90 seriously how many times can you cover up incomplete or shotty work with bubbles
Dec 22 2023,positive,much better than the first the sequel was so much fun
Dec 22 2023,positive,this was a fun comic book movie sure it had its problems but not nearly as bad as recent years of marvel and even dc movies
Dec 22 2023,positive,stunning visuals  stunning cgi  worth the trip to the theatre
Dec 22 2023,negative,your movie if you like lots of bad special effects and mindless battles    story poor acting ok for comic strip
Dec 22 2023,neutral,a fullon superhero movie which puts too much in to give it any depth  tonally its all over the place but with its ample energy passable humour and fastpaced action scenes you cant help but be swept along for the ride  the actings ok the story isnt great the villain is somewhat overshadowed by the real villain and the support characters dont do much beyond filling their roles but it all looks good and there are some wondrous underwater scenes filled with colour and inventive creature designs
Dec 22 2023,negative,the most exciting thing about the movie was the popcorn and the beer i left the cinema with my girlfriend 30 mins before the end if there was a raiting of 0 i would have rate it as that 
Dec 22 2023,positive,as the last movie in the dceu this movie is a solid superhero movie its funny action packed and visually appealing some parts are weird gross and a little to goofy but in all an enjoyable watch
Dec 22 2023,negative,a limp crawl to the finish line for the dceu void of heart or intrigue
Dec 22 2023,positive,loved this movie so much who dislike it has no soul
Dec 22 2023,positive,this is what dc is supposed to be
Dec 22 2023,negative,absolutely horrible writing its an insult to the comic superheroes who go beyond their imagination to defend the worlds they rule this one rules nonsense inconsistency and ignorance
Dec 22 2023,negative,terrible plot seemed like the story didnt flow acting was awful at times the story was boring and not cohesive i wish i could get my money back
Dec 22 2023,positive,it was an action packed adventure where arthur curry learns what it is to be a great king
Dec 22 2023,negative,moviereview aquamanandthelostkingdom    i will say that i believe this is the end of the dceu    they got to do something and they have to restart they cant keep going like this are they gonna destroy the dc universe forever     there is so many movies all over the place and there is no actual universe they dont need to be connected as long as the movies are of quality     the storyline is fine the storyline does what it needs to do but majority of the movie takes place cgi underwater     cgi is not that great to be almost an entire film now when they are on land the cgi is great but when theyre under the water it is goofy and silly     i wouldnt watch it again but it did what it needed to do for that moment and aquaman is definitely marvels version of thor 
Dec 22 2023,positive,this is a super fun cheese fest of a movie its campy funny but overall it still has some heart behind the cgi not as good as the first aquaman but still a worthy sequel 710
Dec 22 2023,negative,the movie was slow and boring
Dec 22 2023,neutral,tries to be funny at some moments but not quite there for me main story is kind of meh nothing really impressive
Dec 22 2023,positive,wonderful movie nothing bad to say loved all of the colors and the features in this movie i cant tween to use one or two but both were amazing
Dec 22 2023,negative,justice for jhonny deep
Dec 22 2023,negative,aquaman himself has a lot of charisma but its wasted in this film the plot is all over the place and the actors chemistry makes it seem like they just returned from a family reunion that went sideways he deserves a better film from everyone involved except for the decent cgi crew this just aint it chief
Dec 22 2023,positive,wasnt quite as i expected but it kinda reminded me of star wars where they run into a bar with aliens and theres a big fish that reminds me of jabba the hut with the girls hanging over him good action and effects it was enjoyable
Dec 22 2023,positive,of course not everyone will like the film but it really does make for a good time
Dec 22 2023,negative,some scenes were so cheap it was cringe to watch it was a good movie but highly disappointing sequel
Dec 22 2023,neutral,certain parts seemed jumbled and badly edited not bad but overall just fell flat and a little boring best part for me was the middle with the brothers
Dec 22 2023,negative,well that was one confusing and rather boring last hopefully aquaman movie which could have been better with perhaps even leading to a third movie if they had listen to actual fans of the franchise but instead of doing the work they only adjusted the trailers in hope people would rush to the theaters and watch this mess without telling their friends and family about it how bad it really is anyway do yourself a favor and watch it on disney when they offer another round of 199 per month subs in the not so distant future believe me its not worth more of your hard earned money
Dec 22 2023,positive,meh momoa wilson randall park and yahya did well with what they were given i guess     other performances were wooden amdram level and pulled me out of the story     first act was way too long to set up the conflict and drama  could have cut out most of it and wed have understood the narrative     some fun touches and light moments but not the magic of the first one     i enjoyed the visual references to star wars and lord of the rings     wait for it to stream
Dec 22 2023,positive,much better than most people seem to be saying it is it was fine and if you cut off the opening few mins itd be even better
Dec 22 2023,negative,in the realm of atlantean legends the climactic battle between the king arthur and his formidable adversary king kordax holds immense potential to captivate audiences with its intensity and drama however rather than delivering a grand spectacle befitting of such legendary figures the conclusion falls short leaving enthusiasts feeling underwhelmed and disappointed
Dec 22 2023,positive,aquamanandthelostkingdom  epic underwater visuals
Dec 22 2023,positive,exciting entertaining fun
Dec 22 2023,positive,fun movie plenty of action
Dec 22 2023,negative,jason mamoa was great as in the first film ah acting was terrible sadly another movie ruined by ah can i get my money back
Dec 22 2023,positive,enjoyed the movie  not sure why critics hate it
Dec 22 2023,negative,it is a normal movie without anything surprising
Dec 22 2023,negative,if this film were merely incoherent ugly trivial and cheaplooking itd fall into the who cares category but giving screen time to a serial abuser with the acting talent of a codfish makes this film the rottenest of rotten tomatoes avoid
Dec 22 2023,negative,i feel terrible for paying money for this
Dec 22 2023,negative,boring it had too much lag its watchable but pretty forgettable movie because it jumps from meaning less action scenes to action scenes without audiences absorbing the story part 1 had better cgi and and visuals overall experience was meh may be play it in the background when youre working when it comes on ott
Dec 22 2023,positive,loved it and it was very awesome great movie would definitely see it again
Dec 22 2023,negative,i am so happy the movies is finally out now the world can ignore it and move on from this poop show they called a movie they should have scrapped it and taken the tax credit clear the movie struggled financially to finish it its shown in the cgi jason did the best he could but even with his giant muscles he couldnt carry the movie
Dec 22 2023,positive,i loved the movie  i knew i would when i saw the low critic ratings    i watch pretty much all action  comic movies and this one is definitely the best i have seen in a while   normally when a movie is delayed i get hyped up too much waiting then the movie disappoints which was not the case this time   these types of movies i normally see 2 or 3 times at the movie theater and this one will be at least a 3 time if not 4 since nothing else is coming out anytime soon   non stop action from start to finish  a good family story good atlantis backstory and a decent amount of humor
Dec 22 2023,positive,the movie is all over the place but some good action the cgi at times was wonky but still enjoyable
Dec 22 2023,positive,me and my friend had a great time watching this opening night its a fun adventure movie with a lot of funny moments while still having a legitimate threat to the characters and world as a whole it had a wholesome story about family fatherhood and brotherhood that was very relatable while jason momoas portrayal of aquaman felt sillier than the other movies we have seen him in he was still able to transition into the serious and powerful hero he needed to be when his family and people where in danger its a shame mera couldnt be utilized more and it was obvious where he screen time was cut down but her moments on screen were impactful
Dec 22 2023,positive,typical dc movie graphics were phenomenal jason mamoa was comical at times it was an entertaining but lighter movie i enjoyed
Dec 22 2023,neutral,its not terrible standard type of sequel that may not be better than the original yet has lots of cgi action it doesnt take itself too seriously as a film and more of go with the flow type of movie might be better to stream than see in theatres
Dec 22 2023,negative,lost kingdom prepare for two hours of your life to be lost
Dec 22 2023,positive,it was good but not as good as the first because of decreased action scenes
Dec 22 2023,negative,aquaman and the lost kingdom is a film that is lost in all aspects the films attempt to be dramatic and serious is done awfully while i would have loved to enjoy this film i often found myself wondering when this movie would end the dceu should have ended with the flash

Dec 22 2023,positive,entertaining feom start to finish too much college dude vibes sometimes but it gets the job done
Dec 22 2023,positive,the film was an exceptionally delightful superhero movie one of the best i have seen this year the captivating charisma of the brothers the uproarious jokes and the childlike exuberance that jason momoa exudes in his portrayal of the titular character are simply delightful to witness the breathtaking worlds and the captivating allure of atlantis on display were mesmerizing to behold   the pacing was excellent ensuring that there were no dull moments throughout   i wholeheartedly recommend this movie for the entire family this christmas it is both enjoyable and wholesome with the exception of the climate change subplot

Dec 22 2023,negative,it sucks waste of money
Dec 22 2023,positive,absolutely brilliant a must see from the likes of the flash that was extremely poor to this is so good yet so sad as well probably never see jason momoas aquaman again ripdceu
Dec 22 2023,negative,the visuals were beautiful my wife and i both fell asleep during the movie the humor was not funny it was hard to feel any connection to the characters it very much felt like they were trying too hard the entire movie after the first 10 minutes i was very aware i was watching a screen the whole time as opposed to enjoying a story
Dec 22 2023,positive,lots of fun  great action the story couldve better but nevertheless enjoyed it  had a good time
Dec 22 2023,positive,entertaining and action packed  a bit formulaic but well worth it i thinks this a great film for the family grab a popcorn forget your worries and just enjoy
Dec 22 2023,negative,a mess of a movie 
Dec 22 2023,positive,me and my family loved it
Dec 22 2023,positive,a school that meets what is expected and even more without the need to surpass the first installment is an enjoyable film
Dec 22 2023,positive,loved this one the comedy was worth it the story opens for another bunch if possibilities
Dec 22 2023,negative,climate change lecture disguised as a superhero movie saw it in imax and had trouble staying awake poor script the actors even seemed bored meh
Dec 22 2023,negative,i have come out of the cinema thinking what did i watch    for a studio with deep pockets you can tell they had the lowest expectations for this film with all their stupid decisions made on the dceu and this reboot stuff with gunn it come across that they hired the least tallented writers vfx artists and the performances from each actor is so unenthusiastic its clear non of them wanted to be there poor quality action scenes that focused so much on shakey cam cgi to hide the fact that jason put in minimal effort to get in shape so most likley had his stunt double doing everything the plot building was just story board to story board with no flow and while it was an ok attempt at world building the not so subtle global warming messages came through loud and clear not that i mind that as its important to highlight human impact on the world no references to any of the other events in the world or heroes themselves william defoes character was killed off before the movie starts    i was just bored the whole way through at least the flash had some fun moments and comedy that landed very poor and empty cinemas so ends the doomed dceu and my favourite comic book characters go to the reboot in the sky
Dec 22 2023,negative,a re hash of the same old dribble i agree with another reviewer about the sloppy editing and convoluted story line if youre going to the movies this christmas weekend go see wonka
Dec 22 2023,negative,not a vibe these good reviews are lies   i went with a friend because they begged me too i didnt want to see the movie for obvious reason and when we go there my friend got the tickets and we went to the concession stand and order our food etc the lady at the concession stand asked us what we were going to see and we told her aq2 and she just looked at us like we were stupid we got to the theater and there we only 2 others in there yikes i was so embarrassed   as for the movie it was cringe it was terrible it was the worse movie ever   i would also like to mention that the 2 other girls in the theater apparently didnt hear the ah news and were pissed when she came on screen they booed and actually left
Dec 22 2023,positive,its a great movie for the holidays fun funny and goofy at times but still a great movie to watch with the family
Dec 22 2023,negative,rinse and repeat please go see another movie
Dec 22 2023,positive,all characters in this movie has their own moments the fighting scenes are incredible a great film to close the dceu
Dec 22 2023,positive,its just mediocre corny as hell
Dec 22 2023,positive,great popcorn flick loved the inside jokes tbh i dont get the hate its not oppenheimer of course but the movie is lots of fun and should be given a chance
Dec 22 2023,negative,messy tone doesnt know what kind of film it wants to be script problems as the dialogue is terrible director wanted to mix 4 different genres into one movie and it doesnt work action scenes are boring treats the viewer like they have been lobotomised since the first movie two years too late terrible
Dec 22 2023,positive,to be honest james wan did all his best to keep the movie massive the special effects of the movie are amazing the actors work very hard and there are some relaxed and happy moments from time to time it is very suitable for people who like various visual effects however the plot is too simple the final boss battle is very weak and the middle part is too long maybe constrained by cost and time no matter what i think its a good ending for the dceu
Dec 22 2023,negative,i thought the movie was corny a lot of bad takes on the book of enoch  seems like hollywood is trying its best to hide things in plain site with movies like this so much effort in mocking religion they forget to make the movie interesting
Dec 22 2023,positive,james wans aquaman and the lost kingdom is a goofy lighthearted adventure that delivers plenty of well staged cgi infused action sequences which keeps things entertaining but the cobbled together script keeps it from being memorably fun    full review    
Dec 22 2023,negative,the chemistry between the brothers is the only good thing in the movie but that did not save this full of cringe cliched movie for me
Dec 22 2023,positive,great movie wish zack couldve finished his vision with the dceu jason is playing aquaman wouldve been nice seeing jl members appear in the film i think the movie critics from rotten tomatoes are just tired of hero films and have a basis with marvel over dc to dc have better characters and a unique storyline to tell hopefully this new dcu will stick more to the storyline in the comics and add some dark into it
Dec 22 2023,positive,it is a nice movie but dont wait more than that  momoa is a great actor and the aquaman character is perfect fit with him between that the movie bring all dc environment with a cup of action and fantasy better than that it is not a funny and commedy like every movie marvel that beg you to laught    negative points is that youll percept that aquaman is always be saved by who mera she is always there to save him not his brother not his mother but only mera
Dec 22 2023,positive,its fine entertaining and at a times funny it looks like jason momoa its having a blast with this character but the big elephant in the room is the fact that is a lord of the rings rip off i mean even gimli is on the film for good sake
Dec 22 2023,positive,although the story is a little worse than the first movie it is still a very fun movie people should not believe in fake rumers
Dec 22 2023,positive,i had the lowest of low expectations and this drastically surpassed them it was quite enjoyable
Dec 22 2023,positive,despite being a doa release aquaman and the lost kingdom is a fun movie ive heard it described as an episode of the justice friends in many aspects and in those aspects youll get laughs and be engaged     the villains are formidable and are as threatening as they need to be theres lots of comic references but it is held back due to the fact that certain actors are in the movie and others arent as enthused to be there given the state of the dc movies
Dec 22 2023,negative,im not fan this movie
Dec 22 2023,positive,this movie is a very amazing movie from the action emotional and comedy bits it was all good and a pleasant way to end the dceu definitely recommend to see in theaters
Dec 22 2023,positive,the movie was action packed and the story line was interesting
Dec 22 2023,positive,this was a blast with this being the final entry in the dceu its bittersweet moment for a lot of us but i enjoyed my stay for better or worse
Dec 22 2023,positive,best movie of 2023
Dec 22 2023,positive,the action and special effects were pretty good i enjoyed the movie this movie ℹ only recommend it for people who like superhero  movies  and like scifi 
Dec 22 2023,positive,i loved the storyline of family and the visuals were incredible and it was action an comedy together
Dec 22 2023,positive,good movie worth to watch
Dec 22 2023,positive,the story was a little off but there was a great story underneath all of it they should have included at least 20 extra minutes to help flesh out the story
Dec 22 2023,positive,mostly entertaining almost great
Dec 22 2023,positive,a fun movie to enjoy with the family a wild ride along the way jason was awesome along with the rest of the cast wasnt the greatest however had its fun  funny moments dont understand why the movie critics are hating so much makes me wonder sometimes if theyre being paid off by marvel to hate but thats hollywood
Dec 22 2023,negative,its somewhat entertaining but its very sloppy editing just to take mera out of the film the trend of really bad 2nd part dc films continues
Dec 22 2023,positive,its a shame the dceu couldnt get its stuff together these last two films blue beetle and aquaman have completely blown it out of the water this movie takes me back to weekend mornings watching cartoons with my cousins overall and amazing vibe and fun sequel
Dec 22 2023,positive,we loved it it was actionpacked funny with great scenery and kept you entertained the whole time the two brothers together have a good chemistry and it made it fun my fiance liked it more than the first one
Dec 22 2023,positive,if you liked the first aquaman you may like this more  really beautiful and fun movie with touching moments of being a father mother and brother    at times it felt like avatar indiana jones and star wars in one movie  arthur and orms chemistry was better than arthur and meras from the first movie  is this citizen kane  no but will you have fun  yes
Dec 22 2023,negative,i thought it was fine for kids but theres nothing new here it could have been shorter the villain could have been better it took too long for the action to start  if i was watching it on tv at home id be playing games on my phone too because it doesnt keep your attention
Dec 22 2023,positive,nice end for jason mamoa as aquaman good pickup story as a sequel wouldve like some reference or ties with the dcu but at the same time it was proper due to this film being the farewell overall it was a fun flick for me
Dec 22 2023,negative,what a complete pos does scatwood eve n know how to produce cinema anymore i am done i will not set foot in a cinema in 24 as my money is better used elsewhere
Dec 22 2023,positive,what a way to end off the dceu just wish they had gave us an explaination to how this is all gonna tie in to the dcu
Dec 22 2023,positive,pretty good sequel too bad the dceu and zacks vision is being pushed out by the new regime i hope gunn has an ace up his sleeve with his vision because the dceu for better or worse was still pretty top notch
Dec 22 2023,positive,good entertainment funny jokes lots of action these critics are hags with no sense of adventure or fun dont listen to them
Dec 22 2023,positive,aquaman and the lost kingdom improves on the first movie in all aspects but adds heart to it
Dec 22 2023,positive,i found it fun to watch in the moment but it lacks depth and is very much a superhero movie when i watched it i was getting thordark world environment edition vibes and it was not executed properly at all the action was fun but the story was hot potato and became uninteresting from the second act all in all not the worst movie ive seen many will say its complete and utter garbage others will say its the best movie to exist i will say its another superhero movie and if you like those youll enjoy this
Dec 22 2023,positive,when a sequel connects greatly with the first one you enjoy it more and feel respected as fan and as a viewer aquaman 2 has that also great performances by momoa and wilson
Dec 22 2023,negative,script is weak and acting is corny  the fight scenes saves the movie otherwise i was falling asleep
Dec 22 2023,positive,it was an entertaining movie
Dec 22 2023,positive,honestly had no hype for this i thought the first one sucked but this one brings dc back to basics you know the plot its very predictable but also its so fun the comedy works and some of the battle scenes are badass honestly its a turn your brain off movie night type of film
Dec 22 2023,neutral,aquaman and the lost kingdom has lost nearly everything that made the first movie enjoyable sure it has its moments but overall it is a disaster of a movie i didnt mind the first movie but with this one its like they forgot how they made it its pure visual noise  a dumb forgettable kitchensink kind of movie that lacks substance aquaman 2 suffers from nearly every issue currently plaguing the superhero genre such as an overreliance on goofy comedy a weak script with a bland campy narrative a forgettable villain a lack of emotional stakes iffy cgi an overuse of needle drops little to no character development appalling dialogue a rushed story that prioritizes actionspectacle and doesnt even take itself seriously the film just has no dignity  doing whatever it can for a cheap laugh or what it thinks is a cool moment in the way weve seen thor love and thunder and quantumania do  even ending with a joke version of the i am iron man moment it was just way too silly and goofy never feeling tonally like a dc or aquaman movie should instead it plays like a cartoonish familyfriendly adventure film like jumanji or journey 2 the mysterious island i didnt even find it that much fun the highlight of the film is easily jason momoa and patrick wilsons chemistry as seeing arthur and orm in a sort of buddy roadtrip movie was enjoyable but even momoa drove me nuts at times  way overdoing it and playing himself rather than aquaman wilson was easily the mvp of the movie but was so underutilized i did like the attempt to have a message about climate change and pollutionemissions but i didnt think it hit as hard as it shouldcould have james wan again goes hard for the films action scenes with some dynamic camerawork but this was trite bland and visually ugly to look at ultimately this movie is an underwhelming mess i feel sad for the movie and for the people involved as it has no dignity and ends up being laughable so much for a grand finale to the dceu  instead this was embarrassing it isnt completely unwatchable just not good and not that much fun full of cliches and wasted potential but hey it was better than the flash  even if it does make quantumania look like citizen kane what a terrible end to an already bad year for superhero films shouldve been called aquaman and the lost screenplay    goodbye to the dceu despite some moments i dont think well miss you now onto the dcu in 2025 i really hope this time they get it all right
Dec 22 2023,positive,it wasnt that bad there was lot of jokes but they wasnt as bad then thor love and thunder fights was amazing and the villain was bad ass i give it a rating of 610
Dec 22 2023,positive,a really fun movie loved it
Dec 22 2023,positive,i had a lot of fun with this movie
Dec 22 2023,positive,film as expected for a dc comics superhero production fun without being stupid knowing how to deal with serious topics too without falling into the publics disinterest i will miss the dceu
Dec 22 2023,positive,best superhero movie in years awesome visuals  it combines every good thing about adventure movies like pirates of the caribbean star wars lord of the rings etc  theres no reason for it to have a comparable tomatometer to green lantern  910
Dec 22 2023,neutral,i refuse to believe james wan had anything to do with this   from badass in zsjl to cringe character assassination at it finest just another joke fest dc bomb you can tell its been butchered to hell jason mamoa deserved better the end scene was the worst yet releasethewancut 
Dec 22 2023,positive,fun and excellent to watch with the family i recommend this movie
Dec 22 2023,positive,aquaman is a cinematic marvel immersing viewers in a breathtaking underwater world jason momoa shines as the iconic hero as i enjoyed this epic adventure i couldnt help but appreciate onlive infotech my trusted web hosting provider they ensure my online presence runs smoothly just like this movies stunning visuals
Dec 22 2023,negative,should have cut the abusive lying bedshitter out completely mamoa and the bedshitter had zero chemistry and that plot line couldve been taken much further without a bed pooping zionist but replaced with a normal human
Dec 22 2023,negative,it is total garbage i lost my time
Dec 22 2023,negative,first i will admit that i am not a dc fan  with that being said the movie was mediocre at best  i like the story line but the acting was subpar  the story progressed at a decent pace yet lacked a lot  not the worst movie i have seen this year but id say skip it and watch it when it goes to streaming
Dec 22 2023,negative,this is a mess of a movie the editing makes it feel like the story is all over the place it simply goes from one action sequence to another without any room to develop the story of explore the characters more i feel like its a movie that has been made for people with very short attention spans the special effects are pretty poor the main bad guy is uninteresting and non of the jokes seemed very funny to me a sad end to a chaotic run of dc films james gunn to the rescue hopefully
Dec 22 2023,neutral,out of the 2023 superhero movies i think this is probably the third best behind across the spiderverse  guardians 3 but being better than the rest is not really a compliment it has fun moments but the plot is nonsensical some ropey cgi and so so acting mamoa is nearly as over the top as he was in fast x quite irritating tbh
Dec 22 2023,positive,hell yeah its awesome thanks to jm love it glad i seen it cant wait to see again
Dec 22 2023,positive,sooo much better than the first one
Dec 22 2023,negative,i got into most super hero movies with a very open mind and can still find a way to enjoy most of them this unfortunately not one of them too many events happen with an obvious lack of someone writing it going wtf did i just write leading to so many questions these questions get answered with a very last minute input into the movie and its obvious they rewatched it and was like wtf did i just write and the slapped in the worst answers that leave you more confused 010 movie i enjoyed the marvels more than this and thats just sad considering the first movie save your money watch on max in a month
Dec 22 2023,positive,the end of the movie made me wish that fiction would become fact  fast and fun movie for me better than aquaman   meras roleplay was great and i am sad her personal life has effected to the movie but this movie works great without her having bigger role instead you can see a lot good things about value of brotherhood  lots of interesting parts made this movie more interesting   im middle aged movie fan and this movie is worth to see great entertainment and message about climate change and humans partnerships kids probably dont understand everything but i found many little great messages in this movie i wasnt impressed with aquaman but now i want to see it again just in case i missed something so this movie kinda made me more interested with characters of these movies   most great thing in this movie is that its great entertainment for whole family not for very young my kids are 1018 and we all liked it
Dec 22 2023,positive,very gorgeous and well directed movie the story can drag at times but overall very enjoyable and i would recommend it try to see it in imax because the movie is genuinely beautiful
Dec 22 2023,negative,well it started off wrong  honestly didnt get better action was decent but unfortunately it doesnt make up for the storyline the story goes in different directions but never really connected like it should very unfortunate
Dec 22 2023,positive,better then the marvels eternals she hulk the flash the batman and most recent movies    worse then top gun 2 godzilla  1 lol its just a popcorn flick isnt bad nor great but entertaining
Dec 22 2023,positive,best dc movie this year like flash
Dec 22 2023,positive,absolutely good movie to my opinion love or hate dc but you should thank to jason and james for this fantasy
Dec 22 2023,positive,i have some fun the movie is not like a superhero action movie its not even like an action movie its more of a fun adventure movie maybe like jumanji but if i recall the first aquaman movie is also more of an adventure movie than an action movie so if you like the first aquaman then you will also like this one
Dec 22 2023,positive,it wasnt a terrible movie it wasnt a great movie either i dont know if we really needed it honestly i was a little exhausted watching the whole world collapse and crash theme it was too much without proper stakes and a payoff plus as talented and brilliant and layered of an actor jason mamoa is they turned him into a dudebro alcoholic and part time  super hero movies are starting to get exhausting to watch but if you turn your brain off you will be entertained the visuals are gorgeous
Dec 22 2023,negative,wow  im guessing that the era of the superhero film is pver  auqa2 buried it for all time  black manta was cool and comic book accurate
Dec 22 2023,positive,this movie is amazing great way to finish the season dont listen to the haters take the family and see for yourself 
Dec 22 2023,positive,although it is entertaining has comedic elements and has a lot of action its story is quite flat without plot twists and you feel its rush to ignore the dceu and the journey of a superhero to focus more on a visually attractive and entertaining experience with action
Dec 22 2023,negative,check out our nonspoiler reviews on youtube and x
Dec 22 2023,negative,the people who pay to watch this movie as showing that they endorse domestic violence
Dec 22 2023,positive,the clues were interesting the adventure was great i enjoyed it but the ending wasnt as epic as the first aquaman
Dec 22 2023,positive,it was a great watch arthurs and orms dynamic carried the film
Dec 22 2023,negative,while mamoa and heard were still good everything else was awful could tell they and no one at headquarters cared and phoned it in
Dec 22 2023,positive,if u like bro action cool cgi underwater aliens and cheesy cornball lines then this one is for you fun movie same vibe as the first one this sequel is gettin so much hate it makes me like it more out of spite lol
Dec 22 2023,positive,had good messages was funny and good cgi overall it was great
Dec 22 2023,positive,i was really surprised by how well structured and flowing this movie was i mean they went with the obvious asian actor asian jim i do like him but hes everywhere but they managed to show great character dynamics all around i like the balance between the two brothers a lot yes i was one of those people who didnt want to go to see ah in it but i could just ignore her for the most part  its decent compared to the comics aquaman definitely has had some better plot lines in a 2d world but it was a lot of fun i guess i would rank blue beetle above this movie just being honest
Dec 22 2023,negative,this movie was awful my son 11 and i couldnt even make it through the whole thing boring story tree trouble cgi just an awful film all the way around
Dec 22 2023,positive,jason momoa is awesome as aquaman effects are sometimes terrible bad but that is nothing new since endgame    the story is ok but nohting special    rest in peace to the dceu  im going to miss you
Dec 22 2023,positive,really fun cbm enjoyed it with my brothers and some of the twisty storylines
Dec 22 2023,negative,this movie has the best story out of all of the dceu films in 2023 but the film was a comedy jokefest i swear to you the opening has aquamans son peeing in arthurs mouth and the ending has patrick wilson eating a cockroach this movie is a comedy the tone is terrible and it isnt taken seriously at all    tldr great story horrible execution
Dec 22 2023,positive,i really enjoyed the movie i thought it was a tone of fun i thought everyone was really good in this movie the relationship between jason mamoa and patrick wilsons characters was my favorite part
Dec 22 2023,negative,utter waste of time and money
Dec 22 2023,positive,too much comedy felt like watching the first one though the last act of the movie was not bad this is truly the end of the dceu and will wait for james gunns new dcu
Dec 22 2023,positive,it had its moments and had great actions
Dec 22 2023,neutral,unholy cheap cgi frim top to bottom
Dec 22 2023,neutral,movie was neither horrible or good it really felt like a cartoon that had been made into live action except for the cgi so much cgi beyond that  cheesy and a week plot    but not sure anyone who has seen any of the recent dc movies is going into this with high expectations if you want a good excuse to see some trailers for next years blockbusters enjoy some popcorn and hang out with friends  family  its a perfect movie for that
Dec 22 2023,positive,this might be the best dc i seen in a long time 
Dec 22 2023,positive,it was a good movie but this is a final dceu
Dec 22 2023,positive,had fun and never lost interest
Dec 22 2023,neutral,its not as bad as expected unfortunately this film lacks of what made the first one better at times the comedy made it seem as a marvel film cgi is too saturated most of the time for example that pirate undersea world had so much relevance to anything marvel it makes you think you are in a different movie plot aint great considering it has sort of two plots being the second basically an excuse for the first one that foes nowhere that post credits scene totally unnecessary better than the marvels for sure but it doesnt pull it off this is that kind of movie you seat in your house and watch when there is nothing else to see cause it entertains to some degree but it is far from being a decent story told film not gonna mention the elephant in the room but it does make you wanna close your eyes for the few scenes its there in my case i had to make poop jokes the end of the film has to be the most cringe and worst ending ever shame they ended the dceu this way
Dec 22 2023,positive,i dont know why people hated this movie cause it was well paced went by so fast and the visual were good better then the last one for sure
Dec 22 2023,positive,super good and funny loved it
Dec 22 2023,positive,fun and enjoyable which is what i wanted from the film it felt like a animated dc episode and i liked it for that
Dec 22 2023,positive,i enjoyed this movie  but im a big fan of the first aquaman and am attached to this version of the aquaman characters  this movie follows the spirit of that movie and is entertaining enough on its own    if you arent already attached to this version of aquaman though this is very skippable  if you havent seen the first movie you can just watch that instead and have more fun  if you dislike the first movie you wont like this one  this movie is very similar but worse
Dec 22 2023,positive,i think i was waiting for superman   but also aquaman is my most fev character in dc universe 
Dec 22 2023,positive,so funits 20000 leagues under the sea meets star wars meets the walking dead  meets the wan horror world listen there is not a single grain of realism in this film but anyone going to sea get it aquaman expecting nothing short of strange spectacle shouldnt be judging or critiquing this film patrick wilson was truly superb mamoa is just a likable dude stays in his lane and i love it  abdulmateen was a menacing figure fueled by hate alone  i know people are going to revel in the failure of the dceu and further push the internet hate but it doesnt deserve it a lot of artistic vision and talent went into this film so go and enjoy this underwater adventure
Dec 22 2023,positive,i wanted fun  adventure and crazy action and i got all of them in this movie  sometimes movie are escapism from everything and this did exactly that critics may want in depth shakespeare story but at the end all that master is having fun with  fictional characters we care  love and journey with  dceu maybe the end but these characters live our hearts  definitely seeing this again
Dec 22 2023,positive,its more action funbut theres nothing new as the character and extra villan i felt its limited but in a wide range
Dec 22 2023,positive,great movie so many fakeouts that stop the movie from being basic run of the mill you assume you know whats abt to happen and then theres a catch patrick wilson and yahya were the movies stars randall parks comedic relief was well timed and necessary     momoa and heard took a backseat unintentionally their costars really stole the show
Dec 22 2023,positive,the critics suck this movie is great
Dec 22 2023,positive,imax laser at amc expanded imax ratio first aquaman movie ive seen actually really good dont listen to the critics see it for yourself and make your own decision now i just need to watch the first one    make sure to stay till the end for the midcredits scene
Dec 22 2023,positive,had a great time with my family tonight
Dec 22 2023,positive,action scenes were good loved the horror elements completely separated from any of the other dc movies that came before so no need to rewatch or play catch up on anything def worth seeing
Dec 22 2023,positive,its a great movie nice background of the characters
Dec 22 2023,negative,i loved the part when she stepped on a bee  morons terrible movie just for the obvious fact
Dec 22 2023,negative,i didnt expect much but then it delivered even less
Dec 22 2023,negative,i went to see it even though i thought the trailer was awful its like they half finished everything left the theater an hour in
Dec 22 2023,negative,brutal broken clumsily edited cartoonish cgi score didnt match the film horribly written the only redeeming factor was that jason momoa is likable
Dec 22 2023,positive,weak story  tongue in cheek acting and too many special effects
Dec 22 2023,negative,dont just dont go standing in line for self checkout at walmart is more entertaining
Dec 22 2023,positive,if you turn your brain off itll turn out to be a pretty fun ride the comedy was lackluster as were the dialogue and cinematography but the action was fun to watch i feel like this film epitomizes both the good and the bad to come from the dceu
Dec 22 2023,positive,everything went well
Dec 22 2023,negative,we get it hollywood believes in global warming but apparently they dont believe in making any more good super hero movies the worst way to end any dc extended universe plot was just discovered under the arctic but the story melted away within a few moments as you could easily tell we are to blame the humans for everything apparently every single actor gave as minimal of an effort as possible for the end of their dc acting contract from the unbelievable prepubescent fighting of two brothers who are over 40 to the short meaningless backstory rushed through in flashbacks and finally a post climax scene that would be expected to be an ending movie clip of a disneyland hero ride all bad this leaves a worse taste in your mouth than the octopus spit aquaman encounters in the movie    ps do not see this movie in 3d trust me on this youll hear way more about that fiasco for this film in tech articles elsewhere
Dec 22 2023,negative,this movie was very bad
Dec 22 2023,positive,great visually stunning world trotting action buddy cop adventure its got great acting and music and camera work great movie for everyone
Dec 22 2023,negative,the movie is just the reflection of the flash  disappointingthe first one was more serious and interesting
Dec 22 2023,positive,an honorable continuation for the aqua man franchise action scenes are immense story is great the banter between brothers was just perfect some scenes are heavy on the comedy but not too much to pull you away truly sad for the end of the dceu but still a good movie to end it
Dec 22 2023,neutral,one might believe that followers of the dc comics superhero enclave would be admirers and followers of aquaman to those less familiar and questioning the notoriety and fame associated with the character the assignment of the title of superhero to this character might seem suspect identified as an actionadventurefantasy the predominant entertainment feature appears to be fantasy the plot has our aquatic king residing on dry land where he is raising his infant son whose predilection of peeing in his fathers face while being changed is the contribution to humor in the movie there will be the addition of a buried in time and place evil body whose release from magically imposed incarceration under the sea will lead to catastrophic results for all of the undersea worlds and their inhabitants in order to prevent this act of undersea carnage the alliance of several of the undersea kingdoms  with the soon to be released from incarceration of aquamans brother  will form an alliance of sea creatures and human form bodies to do battle against the evil forces there must be an entertainment contribution in all of the computergenerated images but it is difficult for a lesser believer to accept the continuing melding of the less than intimidating human traits and actions of aquaman with his superhero persona as the stuff heroes are either made of or should be made of  rating r  s  i  requires supplemental imagination
Dec 22 2023,positive,fun movie better storyline characters and visuals than the first
Dec 22 2023,positive,the movie was rather good  its a shame that this is the end for the current version of the character and dc universe  there were enough laughs and plenty of actionthe only knock i would give this is there were like 20 saves in it last second and all  that got a little humorous after a while    id give it a go if i were you
Dec 22 2023,positive,this was a great movie following the sequelthe comedy was the there the action was amazing as well there are indeed some downsides for me such as the suit bulkiness for me but thats a personal opinion but i give the film an honest 7810
Dec 22 2023,positive,another breathtaking sequel from dc keep it coming
Dec 22 2023,negative,i think im over comic book movies now after seeing this 
Dec 22 2023,positive,plot strongly revolved around family which i loved fathers protecting sons husbands protecting wives mothers protecting children brothers fighting together and overcoming the lust for power of the thrown monsters looked incredible with overwhelming lovecraftian influence that i really appreciated cgi was well done for the most part really only one place it faltered battles particularly between super manta and aquaman were fantastic and fast paced but not so fast you couldnt keep up  story could have been a little tighter in some aspects like the brotherly discord that caused the lost kingdom to fall and certain transitions were slightly jarring but otherwise solid storytelling  ah is in it for a few scenes even fewer lines but is sidelined for a good portion after she takes a manta ray to the chest  heavy handed on the climate crisis messaging but in the context of the filmdumping the equivalent of nuclear waste into a volcano that has an engine designed to heat up the earth for the sole purpose of melting the ice prison that is antarctica it made sense could have done without the eating the cockroach joke scene  some funny oneliners brotherly banter was endearing and believable definite character growth for both arthur and orm ending line with king arthur speaking to un is a definite callbackhomagedirect take from i am iron man but dang if it didnt stick  score was like another character on its own which has been missing in movies lately  allinall a fun romp through the ocean that brings two brothers together saves their family and the world and manages to throw in some popculture left hooks that really landed  definitely worth the watch
Dec 22 2023,positive,good action and story line
Dec 22 2023,negative,this was so lame i walked out 30 minutes into the movie and walked into thanksgiving instead which was awesome 
Dec 22 2023,positive,awesome movie going to see it four more times
Dec 22 2023,positive,despite the pile on of early bad reviews of aquaman the lost kingdom i must say the film was fun its definitely for younger viewers dispite some curse words this is a family adventure story about family the cg was good the trident fights matched the best of lightsaber duels from the star wars franchise the messaging was very captain planet that didnt go too overboard  i would definitely take the whole family to see this movie for christmas
Dec 22 2023,positive,was fun and entertaining kids loved it
Dec 22 2023,positive,the movie was way better paced than the previous  aquaman movie  dont have too many complaints
Dec 22 2023,positive,the movie is the same level as   avatar game of thrones   i feel bad for people who criticize the movie never even  watched it     the story is so smooth and really touching   if you about to write the bad review i will suggest to rewatch it   
Dec 22 2023,positive,loved the plot and was a good villain story
Dec 22 2023,positive,great movie i went into it with minimal expectations since the end of the  dceu  it was amazing family oriented feel good story and great  chemistry with aquaman brother
Dec 22 2023,positive,very entertaining lots of action enjoyable not oscar material but a solid superhero flick
Dec 22 2023,positive,great fun movie  arthur and orm have a great bromance and epic jokes action is breathtaking and cgi as well highly recommend
Dec 22 2023,negative,teri le cgi performances were okay not great
Dec 22 2023,positive,really great movie probably gonna see it again
Dec 22 2023,positive,absolutely amazing i definitely watch this 
Dec 22 2023,positive,a fun momoa time  popcorn blockbuster action superhero movie  dceu movies are not for deep thinkers the critics are haters of comic book movies if you like the first one watch it again then watch this new one like we did  fun
Dec 22 2023,positive,storyline was just as good as the first one seeing it in 3d would be awesome  good way for the dceu to go out
Dec 22 2023,positive,great movie lot of action
Dec 22 2023,positive,dceu is finally over
Dec 22 2023,positive,i enjoyed it it was fun nothing to serious the scenes was lovely had stakes and a happy ending ending i am not sure why the critic score is so low may watch it again
Dec 22 2023,positive,amazing visuals sadly this is the end of the dceu  james wan does an amazing job of taking us into the ocean kingdoms i really enjoyed it
Dec 22 2023,positive,james wans directing truly carries this film jason momoa as aquaman is surprisingly undercooked compared to his other appearances as aquaman patrick wilson is a great counterpart to jason mamoa though which salvages parts of this film the script is kind of all over the place and somewhat unorganized overall the action is good and its sad to see the dceu go but this movie further proves a need for redirection as it got rather messy which seemed to be the theme for the dceu
Dec 22 2023,positive,amazing film lots of humor action suspense and heartfelt scenes truly remarkable cast and well played highly recommend the movie to all who love  storytelling comics heroes and supervillains
Dec 22 2023,positive,aquaman 2 just go see it    want to kill a few hours enjoying a beer and a burger go see aquaman 2 it is gloriously dumb fun its like 70s disney had a love child with tsui hark and sam raimi      there is nothing deep here no compelling human arcs like godzilla minus one but if you saw the first aquaman you dont expect that there isnt anything terribly poignant everything is kind of one note but those notes are coming at full auto right at your face for every second of the two hours     its simple frenetic and a glorious visual mashup that demonstrates some brilliant world building james wan may not be as able to touch on the human condition like his obvious influence tsui hark but he is to movies what image comics was to will eisners spirit dont think about it just have fun    id go in expecting nothing and youll come out feeling great what fun just dont stop to think about it because it never even pretends that you are supposed to    at a time when there just isnt dumb fun anymore this is gloriously great dumb fun    even my elderly motherinlaw loved it which i never saw coming
Dec 22 2023,positive,funny and actionpacked loved aquaman and orms relationship and interactions
Dec 22 2023,positive,absolutely fire its better to understand the first movie before watching the second one in my opinion but either way i found it great and bringing back orm was like a half good especially at the end when he ate a cockroach twice one alone and another in a burger33
Dec 22 2023,negative,holy hell this is mindless ugly cinema the action is ugly the comedy misses 90 of the time the cgi is surprisingly unpolished the story is all over the place     aquaman and the lost coherence
Dec 22 2023,positive,it was a fun adventure movie it reminded me of a video game with the plot
Dec 22 2023,positive,fun but predictable satisfying as a movie but not as a closure to dceu
Dec 22 2023,neutral,more of the same   i hope that james gunn takes dc to more satisfying heights   this movie is somewhat entertaining  but predictable thanks trailer
Dec 22 2023,negative,movies all over the place and shows obvious signs of multiple reshoots i had hoped for a more serious tone and less of the trademark goofiness james gunn has been injecting into these last dceu movies but alas it was not to be youd think wb would want more of the overwhelmingly positive feedback zsjl garnered but they seem deadset on making silly superhero flicks even going so far as to make james gunn of all people the boss long story short im done with dc until wb sells it off
Dec 22 2023,positive,veey fun adventure movie lots of action norm and aquamans dynamic is the best parts
Dec 22 2023,positive,this movie was great fun good fx and lots of chases and fights plus funny bits jason momoa always gives you your dimes worth a good way to decompress and forget the stress of the holidays
Dec 22 2023,positive,its a pretty boand superhero movie but the chemistry between jason and patrick is  good and the villain absolutely carry this movie and its tremendous in imax 3d
Dec 22 2023,positive,this movie was an absolute blast i loved the first one and this one is even better everyone is still great in their roles and some are even better now the comedy was great and not overdone like another comic book movie series likes to do and throw a joke every ten seconds the story was awesome the villian was great very happy with this film
Dec 22 2023,positive,its just good enough to not be terrible thats about the best thing i can say about it
Dec 22 2023,positive,aquaman is a good film the story special effects outstanding cant wait until the next movie
Dec 22 2023,positive,i saw the film and i personally enjoyed it i felt the film was fun and full of action and was overall a wonderful feel good superhero film
Dec 22 2023,neutral,the movie was ok disappointed the dcu ends on a low end the writing in the movie was terrible
Dec 22 2023,positive,a mostly fun to watch movie but some of the jokes seemed a little corny there was an over abundance of s words and the final boss battle left much to be desired other than that i enjoyed it
Dec 22 2023,positive,liked the action humor and spotlight on how we are harming the oceans and the planet by being poor stewards of the environment
Dec 22 2023,positive,perhaps not as good as the 1st but a lot fun story plays out exactly like i would want to
Dec 22 2023,negative,i was two long hours but my 12 y old loved it
Dec 22 2023,positive,i just like the action the story line and that the 2 brothers are not against  each other
Dec 22 2023,positive,special effects costumes storyline were all there easily could have led to another movie but a hastily wrapped up conclusion implies a final decision to succinctly wrap up the aquaman franchise a shame really considering i would still watch a solo mera movie  despite the bathroom joke in this movie involving mera and her son
Dec 22 2023,positive,so much action great battle scene s amazing story
Dec 22 2023,positive,the story changed a lot from something potentially big to something regular but the cgi the edits the jokes action and james wans signature scares were good enough to send off the dceu
Dec 22 2023,positive,its a fun movie that has no connection to any other its script is predictable but keeps you in its play  if you feel like going to the movie theatre this is a good option
Dec 22 2023,negative,a simple film with poorly chosen music a very basic script the first 40 minutes quite boring it could be that superhero movies are already very worn out or they have failed to connect with the public instead of seeking to amaze with fx
Dec 22 2023,positive,it was good entertainment a few laughs and good moments it was a decent movie
Dec 22 2023,positive,i honestly thought it was going to be really really bad before going into the movie but i love james wan patrick wilson and nicole kidman so i still bought the ticket turns out it is not that bad true that some may call this stupid dumb or whatever but at least the story has a flow compared to many other movies which try to incorporate multiple concepts but fail tell a complete story i honestly would give this movie a better rating is it james wans best effort probably not is it the best super hero movie out there probably not either but at least i had some fun in the theater without having to worry about if i dont get any hidden message honestly not as bad as some might claim
Dec 21 2023,positive,aquaman and the lost kingdom is a lot of fun fans of the first movie will undoubtedly enjoy this second outing the team of momoa and wilson makes for hilarious viewing the vfx are excellent its the perfect holiday season familyfriendly actionadventure and blank manta is really an fantastic villain it has its issue here and there but its mostly a fun film for the family 355
Dec 21 2023,positive,the movie was not a bad as the critics said its a adventure movie family themed lots of cgi but not a bad movie experience better than many of the recent marvel ones
Dec 21 2023,positive,a great movie now the aquaman 1 and 2 movies go great together its about fun and family and adventure i took 4 kids and they loved it appropriate for children and young people 5 stars
Dec 21 2023,positive,very entertaining gorgeous special effects patrick wilson and jason momoa were awesome nicole kidman and dolph ludgren were fantastic
Dec 21 2023,positive,i liked it more than the first aquaman for sure
Dec 21 2023,positive,not enough cockroaches but overall very touching one of the greatest movies i have ever watched in the week    definitely one of the movies of all time my favorite part is when aquaman said its aqua time and aquaed all over the place
Dec 21 2023,negative,very cheesy not nearly as good as the first one could have been so much better dc is going nowhere it seems i wasnt excited about the first aquaman thought it seemed like a cheesy dumb concept then i saw it and was pleasantly surprised turns out this second one ended up being the cheesy dumb one that i thought the first one was gonna be
Dec 21 2023,positive,a great film with a lot of action and fun
Dec 21 2023,negative,the movie was a bore its just a basic tale of expected events nothing out of the ordinary and nothing surprising meh
Dec 21 2023,positive,i went into aquaman and the lost kingdom expecting another superhero disappointment although its not perfect i thought it was great a great way to end the current dc universe
Dec 21 2023,positive,jason too damn corny in this movie  everything was a big guffaw  too much slapstick humor
Dec 21 2023,positive,the movie is excellent because it completes what was started in the first part and this movie maintains the level of sequence of upcoming movies  in dc universe
Dec 21 2023,negative,pretty terrible acting and boring cgi im sure diehard comic fans will love it but even my 5 year old couldnt stay put long enough to enjoy it because it was the same old same old stuff weve all seen in dozens of other comic book movies except this one had little good going on in it i like a lot of the dc comic book movies but this one is a snore of a movie if you go bring your pillow and your own snacks so you dont feel so ripped off
Dec 21 2023,negative,fuck you james gunn you and your fucking cringe comedy u ruined dc
Dec 21 2023,positive,it was great i think the action was great story was decent overall a fun watch
Dec 21 2023,positive,some of the scenes with the catch lines were funny
Dec 21 2023,positive,one of the best movie of 2023
Dec 21 2023,positive,this movie was amazing totally recommend it
Dec 21 2023,negative,aquaman 2 disappoints falling short even compared to captain marvel 2 despite flashy visuals and action the film feels dull and tedious the script lacks depth almost like it was generated by ai leaving the theater 90 of the content was forgettable with no urge to discuss it not a recommended christmas movie choice consider other options
Dec 21 2023,positive,i really like this movie i recommed iti am so satisfied so go to the movies aquaman 2 is a good movieit is not a bad movie
Dec 21 2023,positive,if only we couldve seen james wans original idea instead of whatever this proenvironmentalism mess was looking at you version with the child murder scene still patrick wilson and jason moanas chemistry makes up for it good effects and visuals watch on imax if you can
Dec 21 2023,negative,i actually walked out of the theater  this is unwatchable  boring bad vfx phoned in acting tries to pretend its better than it is  i wouldnt recommend this to anybody
Dec 21 2023,negative,yawning sleeping and finaly i am hungry buying food for a while thinking to keep eating or going back until the movie finished i finally decided to just going back at least i can sleep there     i eventually just watched the movie until its end and not feeling missing or else     this movie doesnt have any investment feels to it just watch and forget
Dec 21 2023,positive,it is not the best superhero movie but i definitely had a good time and found it much more entertaining and better written than the first one
Dec 21 2023,positive,the film is good dcs best work this year the visuals are also nice the characters are good it deserves a chance
Dec 21 2023,positive,was the movie good the movie was amazing and truly one of dcs best movies yes it had some questionable moments but dont all movies
Dec 21 2023,positive,iits extremely entertaininga worthy ending for dc
Dec 21 2023,negative,the trailer was so bad that i have zero interest in seeing this
Dec 21 2023,positive,really good i loved aqman and orms relationship and how creative the movie felt first 30 minutes were kind of dull but after that its fantasric
Dec 21 2023,positive,nice and funny movie
Dec 21 2023,negative,dont waste your time the movie was awful   well not completely awful there were some good scenes but they were the ones without ah in them she ruined it wb should have listened to us she ruined you all shes a curse
Dec 21 2023,negative,can i have my money back
Dec 21 2023,positive,enjoyed the movie good actions and special effects i believe its a good sum up far better than flash
Dec 21 2023,positive,i like   from thailand 
Dec 21 2023,negative,the acting is actually pretty good i believed everyone in their role  the cgi also looked solid    everything else was a mess of incomprehensible proportions
Dec 21 2023,positive,enjoyable movie way better than what recently came out of mcu
Dec 21 2023,negative,the last dceu movie was expected to end as a banger but ended up being a huge disappointment the movie contains unnecessary jokes cheesy dialogues and lazy acting none of the actors except patrick wilson seemed interested in the project the film had a basic storyline with poor script and dialogue delivery
Dec 21 2023,positive,a james wan aquaman serves exactly what one expect for an adventure film  an adventurous holiday trip in cinema
Dec 21 2023,positive,it was a visually appealing movie  a fun movie  basic story line  one time watch it was   like an underwater adventure some action sequences were pretty good and sea creatures were great
Dec 21 2023,positive,i believe that many reviewers are trying to tank this movie on purpose by throwing together less than impressive written opinion pieces rather than fair and balanced reviews aquaman and the lost kingdom is fun adventurous and the best of the dc offering given to us in a long time  it impressively collaborates the seasoned talents of all involved  no spoilers here but i must say i didnt know what to expect and loved every minute of it  it is the holiday season so go enjoy aquaman and the lost kingdom with its action adventure and humor  for all you aquaman naysayers stop being a grinch with your scroogesque brand of reviews
Dec 21 2023,positive,a wild romp and includes some of that james wan magic that made the first movie a hit the actionthrills are nonstop but there are plenty of laughs as well   momoa has lots of fun as aquaman and patrick wilson is a badass
Dec 21 2023,negative,one of the worst dceu movies ever and that says a lot since its the last one
Dec 21 2023,negative,really good movie visuals stunning is what i wish i could say
Dec 21 2023,positive,super cool and the action super good
Dec 21 2023,positive,aquaman and the lost kingdom  love the action  adventure still has its a fun superhero movie to watch together with the family and to unwind this season a solid show to be seen
Dec 21 2023,negative,againanother bad guy trying to take over the world the good guy who always wins and likewise has a real bad person acting and getting paid for his work after destroying a life
Dec 21 2023,positive,honestly had so much fun with this movie and the visuals were awesome as were the fight scenes story isnt as good but no the less i had an awesome time
Dec 21 2023,positive,this movie was pretty dope way better than the first one story was well written as well
Dec 21 2023,positive,the fight scene helps alot to this movie but the plot i have nothing to say
Dec 21 2023,positive,i expected a disaster  it actually wasnt that bad not saying it was great but compared to the marvels it was a masterpiece probably wait til streaming if your not in a hurry
Dec 21 2023,positive,this movie was incredible it literally starts wiith action and it was nonstop throughout effects were great  if you can see it in imax 3d go  it is so fun  the acting was great good cast fun time all around   highly highly recommend
Dec 21 2023,negative,well just finished watching it was goofy not a solid plot that i expected to be there is nothing in this movie thats thrilling or moving this movie was made only to say goodbye to the dead dceu
Dec 21 2023,negative,the first five minutes is an ill advised trip into parental comedy and the following hour and forty minutes do not improve the experience mamoa looks bored throughout and everything else has that dreaded flashlevel cgi soiling what little entertainment value there might have been left of course the third act devolves into underwater star wars why wouldnt it shout out to randall park and a serviceable supporting cast for the 38 seconds any of them are on screen they did the real work here
Dec 21 2023,neutral,a depressing end to the dceu unoriginal forgetable and just bland
Dec 21 2023,positive,good fun and light hearted momoa as expected steals the show but it is well thought out has good pace and is just enjoyable to watch
Dec 21 2023,positive,good movie but a bit short time need to be atleast 3 hours
Dec 21 2023,neutral,when compared to the previous film the chemistry between arthur and orm seems friendlier in aquaman and the lost kingdom in fact the funny and interesting interaction between the two is what makes this film not boring  it should be appreciated this film succeeded in presenting several new places with beautiful visuals ranging from the kingdom of atlantis the icy seas in antarctica to dense forests that evolved in some parts it is often clear that the cgi is still rough it looks like a video game
Dec 21 2023,positive,a good and fun adventure
Dec 21 2023,negative,this sequel is not bad but not goodbut again its a bad sequel funny 
Dec 21 2023,positive,loved it an enjoyable movie the whole family can enjoy i hope this isnt the end of aquaman
Dec 21 2023,positive,fun but box buster movie with cartoon network story
Dec 21 2023,positive,it was good i loved how they not killed the baby
Dec 21 2023,positive,aquaman and the lost kingdom is an exhilarating cinematic masterpiece that exceeded all my expectations the film brilliantly combines stunning visuals with a captivating storyline immersing audiences in the depths of atlantis jason momoas charismatic performance as aquaman is truly magnetic and the supporting cast delivers stellar performances the underwater sequences are breathtaking showcasing cuttingedge cgi that brings atlantis to life the film strikes a perfect balance between action humor and emotion making it a mustsee for both dc fans and general audiences james wans direction is nothing short of phenomenal creating a sequel that surpasses its predecessor in every way aquaman and the lost kingdom is a triumph in the superhero genre earning its welldeserved 55 stars
Dec 21 2023,positive,the story is very choppy maybe because its been reshoot like a thousand times it became a mess just enjoy it for what it is dont expect more because there is no future for this universe
Dec 21 2023,negative,got a free ticket to advance will say my popcorn was great this movie is boring and very cheesey mera is in it alot which was 1st sign its bad the action parts where everywhere 2 jason is the same from ffx but in water spoilers when the kid gets taken it looks like they filmed 2 different things n glued them together also she cant act n he seemed to be checked out for a horror director this is a nightmare in all the wrong ways watch paint dry rip dc i hope gunn is happy he destroyed something that was great
Dec 21 2023,positive,fresh colorful funny movie as always jason momoa to the rescue his acting is making worth the 2 hours patrick wilson excellent role he is the ocean master fun to repeat it
Dec 21 2023,negative,can we just get rid of the proven abusive actors from films instead of just the accused this movie suffers from it like they knew it would fail so the promotion disappeared  this film is ok for a buddy film but not for a big budget everything and only giving the one thing successfully
Dec 21 2023,positive,nice action scenes with perfect stroyline and good vfx
Dec 21 2023,negative,this movie lacks every element that made the first installment even remotely enjoyable and worthwhile watching with a lackluster villain subpar acting and dialogue and a yawninducing plot aquaman 2 is just another stranded lifeless jellyfish on the dreary beach of failed superhero movies
Dec 21 2023,negative,what in gods name have i just put myself through gunn has well and truly put the final nail in coffin of the dceu aquaman looks like a video game cut scene majority of the time the second act is ok but honestly i just wanted it to be over thank you to sky cinema vip for the free tickets glad i didnt spend a penny on this one     i hope others enjoy what gunn has in store but nope not for me wont support him or his nepotistic vision notapenny
Dec 21 2023,positive,not as epic as the first one but it was entertaining there was one fight scene that actually had me impressed jason is just being jason and having fun is what he does fun night out
Dec 21 2023,negative,trash story telling  music audio
Dec 21 2023,negative,the ending speech sounds like a llm wrote it the only good thing is the underwater hair physics
Dec 21 2023,negative,honestly was one of the better superhero movies i have watched in recent years but thats not saying anything    the villain was passable at best the acting was horrendous and the plot was hilariously predictable    almost like no one put in any effort in the movie other than the vfx artist the movie was visually appealing with many greens and blues with occasional wonky scenes    action was fast paced and forgettable but got me hyped in the moment    overall a very boring time indeed
Dec 21 2023,negative,not the best to be honest even momoa was struggling to inject some oomph into this film  i get the feeling its been soo overworked they lost sight of the original story somewhere along the way  as a sequel to a great film this really didnt work expected more from james wan whos usually good at injecting some suspense into films it was totally missing   you can tell they are ending aquaman this film started with a whimper and went out even worse
Dec 21 2023,positive,visually impactant and excelent but with a generic script aquaman and the lost kingdom its a piece of entertainment but forgetabble
Dec 21 2023,positive,amazing action and characters
Dec 21 2023,negative,not good at allonly star ill give because of jason momoathis movie doesnt even look good cgis are often visually so qualityless
Dec 21 2023,positive,jason momoa is the best choice for aquaman
Dec 21 2023,positive,good to see desert and ice worlds in the movie good movie to end the year 2023
Dec 21 2023,positive,the action shots are great at some points but the story can be confusing at times and can be bland this movie couldve had way more potential sorry
Dec 21 2023,positive,its much of visuals and actionsas a sequel it is very good imax 3d experience was pretty solid
Dec 21 2023,positive,great dc do it again
Dec 21 2023,negative,i was so sleepy because of the boring scenes its that bad
Dec 21 2023,positive,awesome movie guys james wans horror touch is mind blowing every one should watch the movie dont believe in critics review
Dec 21 2023,positive,i saw it today the movie is entertaining i didnt expect much from it but it gave me a good time it is true that it has childish humor some cgi scenes are notable but not like the flash you dont miss anything in the postcredit scene in fact its on twitter a bitter farewell for mamoa like aquaman and the dceu now wait for the plans of the new universe
