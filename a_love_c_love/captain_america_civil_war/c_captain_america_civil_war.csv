"Feb 27, 2024",positive," The biggest cinematic undertaking of the last 15-plus years, Kevin Feige’s grand attempt to serialize blockbuster storytelling has featured some ridiculous highs and some bleak lows. It’s changed the way Hollywood looks at its intellectual properties, and it’s trying to figure out its uncertain future after briefly imploding under the weight of its massive overreach into film and streaming television. We’ve gone through all 33 of the MCU’s films, from 2008’s Iron Man to last fall’s The Marvels, and ranked them according to quality. We don’t include the streaming series in this list, either; just the movies. While you’ll notice a high number of recent MCU films toward the bottom of the list, keep in mind that the series’ struggles post-Avengers: Endgame have been substantial, largely because of storytelling issues. As much as those films showed real promise, they represented a Marvel Studios that lost its consistency, hence the recent efforts to retool the universe. Before we get to the sole MCU film of 2024 in Deadpool & Wolverine, let’s dive into how the 33 films that came before it stacked up against each other. This is truly the low point in the MCU, a film that purely exists to connect dozens of uncompelling dots to a future that probably now won’t happen because of Jonathan Majors being booted from his role as Kang for his legal issues. The film tries to find its own path into the James Gunn-iness of the Galaxy of the Guardians movies, but it fails miserably in that pursuit. We love Paul Rudd, but not even he could save this one from itself. It’s everything wrong with the MCU at its worst: corporate product that exists to expand the empire rather than tell a compelling story with relatable characters. Chloé Zhao is an incredibly talented filmmaker who is responsible for some of the best films of the last decade. Eternals is sadly not one of them. Pairing Zhao with the MCU just simply didn’t work for either party, producing a largely lifeless superhero slog that very much overstays its welcome. Zhao’s natural lighting works incredibly for her arthouse films, but it’s not a match for studio filmmaking. It’s just a huge miss by a major talent, which happens. Taika Waititi’s long-anticipated to the incredibly fun Thor: Ragnarok was an absolute stinker for most of its runtime, one that lost its grip the tonal excellence of its predecessor and wastes a very fun Christian Bale villainous turn. It’s not the worst of the bunch necessarily, but it’s perhaps the biggest disappointment on the list. Nia DaCosta is another incredibly talented filmmaker whose Marvel project went off the rails because of the MCU nightmare machine’s malfunctioning. The film’s story is nearly incoherent, and it leaves a few inspires set pieces to dry with nonsensical villainy and far too much reliance on having seen multiple television shows to understand what’s going on in totality. We don’t blame DaCosta for this; the signs of life feel directly linked to her creativity. Destin Daniel Cretton’s Short Term 12 is one of the best movies of the 2010s, so it hurts our hearts to rank his MCU movie so low on this list. It’s an occasional chore, one that cannot link its kung-fu homages to the CG messiness that envelops the film by its third act. Tony Leung is as good as advertised, but the rest of this movie struggles to live up to that performance. The first sign of trouble in the post-Avengers: Endgame MCU, Black Widow just felt too little, too late, an attempt to make up for the unfairly procrastinated Black Widow origin movie that can’t match its compelling human moments with its bland action set pieces. We liked the cast, but it didn’t live up to the potential of telling Natasha Romanoff’s backstory. The clever bits can’t quite save this one from forgettable territory, even if it’s a step ahead than the rest of the movies on this list. Ant-Man’s first film is the best of the bunch, while this one just felt too small and unimportant in the grand scheme of things to really register. Rather than use that smallness to its advantage, it just felt a bit superfluous. It’s not bad, though. Brie Larson is a terrific actor, but the origin story for her Captain Marvel doesn’t quite live up to what it could’ve been. It is a fun 90s adventure film, and it was about time for the MCU to give a woman her own film in the series. We just wish it was, y’know, more deserving of the moment, even if the moment in and of itself boosts this one up a bit. This one gets a bad rap. It’s by no means a great movie or anything, but it’s got a very good Tom Hiddleston performance and moves at a satisfying clip. The elven villains are notoriously bad, but the rest of the film is alright. While it pales in comparison to Ang Lee’s thrilling 2003 Hulk, Edward Norton’s lone venture into the MCU as the angry green guy was a perfectly suitable introduction for the character. It’s hard that it’s been so long since this one came out, but it’s better than you remember. Definitely the weakest Avengers film, this overstuffed sequel still found a way to take the series into a refreshingly dark direction while giving Jeremy Renner’s Hawkeye a nice spotlight to work with. Still, this one hasn’t aged nearly as well as it played in the moment. The weakest of the Jon Watt/Tom Holland Spider-Man films, this one is like a tasty burrito that is so overstuffed that it falls out the bottom and gets all over your lap when you try to eat it. The film’s second act is as good as advertised, but you have to wade through a very uneven first half to get there. It’s darn good when it wants to be, but it needs a much tighter edit. Coasting on the nostalgia of yesterday can only get you so far when the jokes aren’t landing and the plot gets a little too convoluted. Thank goodness this one found its footing in the second act and eventually lived up to the potential. It was always going to be hard to live up to Iron Man, but Iron Man 2 is probably the MCU film that deserves more credit than it gets. It’s a very enjoyable sequel that deepens the journey for Robert Downey Jr.’s Tony Stark while zeroing in on some really well-crafted fight scenes. It’s a good film; flawed, sure, but we’ve missed this kind of effectively contained storytelling in these movies. The remnants of Edgar Wright’s scrapped vision for this film and Rudd’s impossibly buoyant charm helped the first Ant-Man movie stand out. While it’s still a step behind some of the better origin films, it’s the best Scott Lang movie of the three. It’s funny, it’s got a good heist and, again, there are a few scenes in this that feel preserved from Wright’s ideas. We’ll take it. Kenneth Branagh’s take on the Norse god definitely just scratched the potential that Waititi found with Thor: Ragnarok, but it’s still a very enjoyable origin tale that took full advantage of Branagh’s Shakespeare background in building the Asgardian palace intrigue. It also is the film that first understood how funny Chris Hemsworth could be with good material. Jake Gyllenhaal’s Mysterio and some really clever visual effect sequences give the second Spider-Man a real jolt, as the lighter elements of Holland’s take on the character meshed well with the way this one raised the stakes. It’s a good Spider-Man flick, even if the Tony Stark tech of it all got a little tiring. The first half of the conclusion to the Infinity Saga left viewers in limbo with a gut punch of an ending, even if it wasn’t hard to see how it would all get undone in the next movie. It felt like half a journey, and what you do to get there isn’t necessarily as compelling as what came after it. However, it’s hard to knock the MCU with finding this dour a story and sticking to it to the closing credits. For a year, Marvel wasn’t afraid to avoid a happy ending. That was nice; they should do it again some time. A clever political thriller disguised as a Captain America movie, this one really showed audiences that the MCU could branch itself into some really interesting directions that would pay off in the future. It felt a bit riskier than some of its predecessors, and it complicated the universe in some welcomed ways. It’s not quite the achievement it’s made out it be, but it’s quite good. A spectacular opening to lament the loss of Chadwick Boseman, Ryan Coogler’s directorial savvy and a very complicated villain in Namor helped lift the second Black Panther film through the tragedy of Boseman’s loss. That alone is cause for respect. Even if this one falls into the CG fight mess of most of the MCU films, it’s still one of the better titles on this list. Doctor Strange got one of the best origin films in this series, one that utilized filmmaker Scott Derrickson’s genre bona fides with some mind-bending visuals to couple with Benedict Cumberbatch’s memorable take on the Sorcerer Supreme. Also, adding Benedict Wong to these movies was such a smart move. He never wastes a second of his screen time. The first Holland Spidey film is also the best, one that felt refreshingly removed from the MCU ongoings and scaled down Peter Parker’s universe into a New York City-set drama with real stakes and effective coming-of-age comedy. Michael Keaton’s Vulture is one of the MCU’s best and believable villains. While the MCU never fully capitalized on the fascinating rift between Captain America and Iron Man, this film deserved a lot of credit for creating that fraction in the first place. The airport battle is still one of the best scenes in all of these movies, and the introduction to Holland’s Spider-Man is still such a joy and the best use of his iteration of the character in this series. The first Captain America film is still the best, as Joe Johnston’s World War II action-adventure did an incredibly effective job of introducing Steve Rogers and underscoring the scrappy virtues that defined the character. Chris Evans earned his star power in this role, and he was never better than here. Getting Shane Black to make an Iron Man movie just felt too good to be true, as this fantastically entertaining third Tony Stark solo venture took the markings of a great Shane Black movie and put them in the MCU to great effect. It’s a very subversive, introspective film, one replete with great action sequences and a bad guy switcheroo for the ages. It’s the most underappreciated film in this series by far. The best film post-Avengers: Endgame by a country mile, Sam Raimi’s thrilling, unpredictable Doctor Strange sequel took some bold steps to complicate the MCU while playing into those Raimi staples that make him one of the best filmmakers to ever work in the genre. Elizabeth Olsen’s fascinating heel turn for Wanda Maximoff is still one of the bravest decisions in any of these movies, and Raimi knew exactly how to capitalize on it. It was so gratifying to have Raimi back in the genre, and this was a clear highlight for the MCU to learn from and build off of in the future. Perhaps the most purely fun MCU film to date, Waititi revived the Thor movies in stellar fashion with this incredibly funny, consistently impressive action comedy that boasted freakin’ Cate Blanchett as its bad guy. There are so many inspired bits in this movie, capped with a technicolor smackdown finale that rivals any other in the MCU. This movie is just a blast. Even the most cynical person had to give the MCU its flowers for nailing this grand finale to a decade-plus of storytelling, as the Infinity Saga came to its grand conclusion. It’s a gripping spectacle that closes out so many storylines with a satisfying cap and gave Downey Jr. and Evans some rich material for their final outings as Iron Man and Captain America. The series may never reach this fever pitch again, but we’re glad we got to watch the plan come together in such a memorable way. Gunn is the best filmmaker to ever work in the MCU, and his Guardians of the Galaxy films are the gold standard for this series as a whole. The second installment richened the characters while also giving Michael Rooker’s Yondu one of its best character arcs. Kurt Russell was such an inspired bit of casting as Ego, and the film just packs such a wallop with its deeply emotional finale. We dare you not to cry at what happens during the Cat Stevens needle drop. Gunn’s final outing in the MCU with his Guardians was also one of the best MCU films, period. Exploring Rocket Raccoon’s heartbreaking backstory and welding that with its main story arc just hit like a ton of bricks, as Gunn refused to let this one pass him by without a statement. The film’s final dance scene to Florence & The Machine is just such a joyous summation of why these movies worked so well and why they’ll be so missed in Gunn’s hands. Probably one of the most exciting blockbusters of the 2010s, the first Avengers film was a genuine moment in pop culture, one that pulled off a teamup movie that had never been attempted before in film history. It set the standard incredibly high for how these multi-hero movies would go, and we’re not sure any of the films to come after it ever cleared the bar. Coogler’s masterful first Black Panther film is also one of the best blockbusters of the 2010s, one that created an indelible moment in pop culture that widened spectacle representation in a way that felt sustainable. This one is just everything good about superhero films, from the stellar craftwork to Coogler’s sharp eye for staging the material and Michael B. Jordan’s unforgettable villainous turn that refused easy explanations. Of course, Boseman’s memory lingers high on this one in the rearview, as it was his true moment to shine in the role that defined him. As hard as it is to believe, Downey Jr. was not one of Hollywood’s biggest stars before his first Iron Man movie came out. This film not only led to perhaps the greatest comeback in acting history, but also launched the MCU in spectacular fashion. It’s perhaps the most grounded Marvel film to date, but it’s also one of the absolute best for a reason. Everything is owed to Iron Man, a film that launched a moment and set a standard that hasn’t always been reached. The pinnacle of the MCU was also its greatest risk, as it took a genre filmmaker who had never worked with this big a canvas before in Gunn and some of Marvel’s most obscure characters and made a masterpiece out if it. Guardians of the Galaxy essentially changed the way that superhero movies could be made, adding in a cosmic sense of irreverence and a template for building lovable characters out of oblong sketches. It launched Chris Pratt to stardom and turned Rocket Racoon and Groot into household names. It also showed how putting in the right amount of heart and pathos can essentially make even the strangest of characters the most cheerworthy of heroes. We’re not sure the MCU will ever top the first Guardians film, as it’s the shining standard for what Marvel movies can be. Take risks; hire good filmmakers who fit the mold and let them cook; cast wisely; let these things breathe without so much responsibility to the grander universes. If we can get at least one more movie from Marvel as great as this, it’s a huge win."
"Jan 14, 2024",negative," Capitán América: Civil War (2016) completa la trilogía de este superhéroe que ha comenzado en Capitán América: El Primer Vengador (2011) y seguido con Capitán América y el Soldado del Invierno (2014), ésta última también dirigida por Joe y Anthony Russo, al igual que el film a analizar. Comenzando con un epílogo que retoma al personaje del Soldado del Invierno (Sebastian Stan), cuya psicología se vuelve cada vez más compleja, la acción nos sitúa en el traspaso de una Hydra nazi a una Hydra soviética con más secretos por develar. De vuelta en el presente, el relato hará hincapié en el mismo lugar en el que nos dejó Los Vengadores: Era de Ultrón (2015): ¿representan los superhéroes una amenaza para la sociedad? Un planteo, a su vez, copiado en la reciente Batman vs. Superman: El Origen de la Justicia (2016), en donde Superman representaba para algunos una amenaza para la humanidad. Después de todo, ¿quién no ha pensado al ver estas películas que los superhéroes -mientras salvan el mundo- destruyen media ciudad en sus batallas? En este caso el giro de Capitán América: Civil War es hacer un poquito menos imperialista la escena y darle un poco más de protagonismo a los países del Tercer Mundo. Tras los traspiés de los Vengadores en naciones como Sokovia (país inventado por el universo Marvel) y Nigeria, ocasionando varias muertes, se dudará del criterio de acción de los mismos. El debate dentro del mismísimo seno de los Avengers girará en torno a firmar o no el “Acuerdo de Sokovia”, el cual le quitaría la independencia de acción a los Vengadores para someterlos a la jurisdicción de las Naciones Unidas. Tras la culpa que acarrea Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), éste estará a favor de firmar el acuerdo, mientras que Capitán América no (interpretado por Chris Evans, quien en esta oportunidad se asentó definitivamente en dicho personaje). Desde el inicio del conflicto los Vengadores se dividirán en dos bandos, haciendo que los superhéroes peleen entre sí. De un bando estarán los aliados del Capitán América: Falcon, Scarlet Witch (cuyo personaje ya se había presentado al final de Capitán América y el Soldado del Invierno y desplegado en Los Vengadores: Era de Ultrón) y Hawkeye, hoy incorporándose Ant-Man al equipo. En el grupo de Stark estarán su fiel amigo Rhodes/ War Machine (Don Cheadle), sorpresivamente la Viuda Negra (Scarlett Johansson), con quien siempre confrontaban, Visión y se sumará en una etapa adolescente Spider-Man. El personaje del Hombre Araña será parodiado y utilizado como descompresor de la tensión, dándole toques de comicidad poco eficaz al film. Por último, en este mismo bando, los países del Tercer Mundo también tendrán a su representante: la Pantera Negra (personaje ya presente en los comics), cuya primera aparición en este film nos remitirá a un “Gatubelo” pero con una psicología de personaje más que interesante, que oscila entre la templanza de la diplomacia y la venganza. A partir de allí, desde formalismos cinematográficos como el recurso del montaje paralelo, el Capitán América e Iron Man serán dos caras de una misma moneda. La figura del “gran villano” está algo desdibujada en comparación al universo al cual los comics nos tienen acostumbrados, pues éste será un hombre bastante común con sed de venganza, lo que permitirá acentuar la dicotomía (hoy interpretado por el gran Daniel Brühl, cuyo rostro y expresiones desde el inicio nos invitan a lo siniestro). Como siempre no podía faltar el cameo del milenario Stan Lee, sin quien el universo de Marvel no existiría o al menos no tal como lo conocemos. Para concluir, la narración está basada en un desarrollo muy lento que sin embargo nos mantiene expectantes, pero no por su ritmo sino por el deseo de que la verdadera acción heroica comience. Puesto que la “guerra civil” será más verbal que física, las batallas importantes se resumirán en dos: una incluirá dos bandos y la otra un “dos contra uno”. Es pertinente destacar que las peleas, sobre todo las iniciales, poseen un efecto que produce extrañamiento: son cámaras súper rápidas que otorgan una suerte de realismo a los movimientos. Las batallas poseen pocos momentos de lucidez en comparación con otros filmes de Marvel, pues parece que allí reside el conflicto de este nuevo universo de los comics: lograr el equilibrio entre las peleas y las palabras. Quizás deberían tomarse más tiempo para desarrollar los guiones en vez de lanzar películas tan seguido, pero bueno… es sabido que estas siguen alcanzando la cima en la taquilla. En adición a ello, consideramos que los films de comics en lo que van del presente año no fueron ni son para nada brillantes, veremos qué sucede con el próximo opus de Marvel, X-Men: Apocalipsis (2016), a estrenarse en breve; después de todo a nivel narrativo esta saga es la más compleja y profunda dentro del universo de los comics."
"Aug 19, 2022",positive," While an understandable superhero movie fatigue has sat in for many, longtime invested fans look forward to each new installment to the Marvel in DC cinematic universes. For me personally, the Captain America films have been particularly exciting. Part of it is due to my love for the Cap character dating back to my childhood. But it is also because the previous two films have been among Marvel’s best especially 2014’s “The Winter Soldier”. The third Cap movie holds an unusual position in Marvel’s grand picture. It doesn’t actually feel like a Captain America film. It feels much bigger and broader – an Avengers-like installment if you will. Anthony and Joe Russo return to direct a screenplay by Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus. The filmmakers have certainly made a movie which seeks to expand the MCU’s narrative rather than telling a tighter more focused Captain America story. The story is inspired by a fantastic Marvel comics crossover event that ran from 2006 through 2007. The story had a ripple effect that reached to several individual hero comics most notably Captain America’s. Here (as expected) there are few similarities to the comic arc other than a rift between the Avengers. The massive destruction and casualties following the Avengers previous battles have driven governments worldwide to adopt the Sokovia Accords which places the Avengers under United Nations control. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) signs off on the resolution seeing the Avengers as no better than criminals if they are unwilling to play by rules. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) stands firm in his trust of the team’s judgment and his distrust of the politics behind governments. The rift between heroes presents itself early on but the film takes its time in developing it. Along the way the it ties up several loose ends from the previous two Cap movies as well as put heavy emphasis on his continued search for Bucky, A.k.A. The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan). “Civil War” features so many moving parts and most of them function well. The established characters still have the same charm and charisma and I still enjoy spending time with them. That’s one reason it is easy to be effected once the tension springs up. Marvel Studios has done a great job introducing their characters and developing the relationships between them. A couple of noticables are missing here but some new players are added into the fold (Chadwick Boseman is fantastic as Black Panther and Tom Holland takes on the role of Spider-Man). Storywise things are the best when the focus is on the. But it flounders a bit in telling the story of a mysterious Sokovian militant played by Daniel Brühl. His story is a bit scattered and never has a satisfying end. Another strength of the film is its pulse-pounding action. Part of what made “The Winter Soldier” great was that it used a lot of traditional effects and stunt work. It’s the same here. Intensely choreographed action sequences come in spurts and each are incredibly impressive. Of course we get some CGI, but the hand-to-hand combat and wild chase sequences are mainly done via old-school means and several of the scenes are still carved in my memory. The film also steers clear of the big, mind-numbing, CGI laden finale. No crumbling skyscrapers or citywide devastation. It’s still a violent ending, but much more personal and consequential. The movie should also be commended for genuinely trying to ask some significant questions and deal with some weighty issues. And it doesn’t just toss them out there and them leave them behind. These dilemmas run throughout the film. Characters wrestle with death and loss. Others struggle with responsibility and consequences. And while the film may not be an appeal to deep thinkers, among its large amounts of fan service it does explore areas that few from the genre care to. “Captain America: Civil War” feels like it could be titled “Avengers: Civil War”. In fact, it actually serves as a better Avengers sequel than last year’s “Age of Ultron”. But we do still get plenty of Captain America and his character is still the most intriguing piece in this entire puzzle. But as a whole the movie does more to alter the landscape of the Marvel Cinematic Universe as we know it. By the end things are much different. Characters have been impacted. Relationships have been affected. Most importantly it sets before us a very interesting landscape and the potential for some incredibly intriguing storylines. I can’t wait to see where things go next. Great review! I loves this movie so much, but I did think it felt more like a Cap film then an Avengers one. Infinity Wars (or whatever they’re going to call it now) will be interesting. Interesting. It felt more like an Avengers movie to me but with Cap as the main character. Especially when you compare it to the other two movies. Still loved it though. This was a phenomenal film.  Everything felt…balanced.  That’s a hard thing to do in a movie of this scale, when you have so many important characters and plot points to cover.  I think Robert Downey, Jr gives his best performance as Tony Stark in Civil War.  Everybody else is just as good, though.  The film also blazes through the story.  For a 2.5 hour film, it didn’t feel like it.  It doesn’t slow down when introducing new characters like Black Panther, who absolutely fantastic.  For me, personally, I think that Civil War is the best MCU movie to date.  Considering that Winter Soldier was a truly exceptional film, that’s quite an achievement in my eyes.  This is the movie that Age of Ultron should have been. I completely agree. Age of Ultron hasn’t left that much of an impression with me. This one is much better. Well made and a lot of fun too.  Great read Keith, man this thing has really struck a chord with everyone (myself included, a skeptic when it comes to Captain America films). One of the main praises its receiving is its ability to balance all the characters and give them each a chance to shine without really “outshining” anyone else. (I suppose you can always make the argument Tony’s signature wit still is the most prominent ‘characteristic’ of any of them but still, even he dialed back the snark here. Things are serious man!) I really enjoyed it and gave it a much higher score than I ever thought I would. It’s really good, right. I think Winter Soldier may still be my favorite Marvel picture but this is close. It is really well written and well made with only a couple of things that I didn’t feel worked. But still (as you touch on), juggling that many characters and that big of a story arc is pretty tough. Miraculously they pull it off. Nice review. I wasn’t as big a fan as everyone (thought it took a while to get going and I didn’t feel the initial action scenes), but in the end I did think it was entertaining and I would like to see the airport fight scene again. Thanks. I really went for the action scenes. I really like the way they film hand-to-hand combat and chase sequences. It really fits characters like Cap, Bucky, Panther, Widow, etc. But I also appreciate how well they do when it’s time to go big. The more fantastic superpowers are also very well represented. Pretty much liked them all. I’ve always loved the MCU, despite some of it’s mediocre entries (Thor 1&2, The Incredible Hulk), but this one just might be my favorite. Deeply rooted in emotion, breathtaking action, and a plot that emphasized the consequences of what it means to be a superhero. I can see this becoming one of the quintessential movies in the genre a few years down the line. Great review! Thanks man. I loved how this one asked some deeper questions but doesn’t just leave them for all of the normal cliches. It makes the emotional themes a pivotal part I the story. Loved that! Another great review. Your points match my own. In particular the villain’s story. I felt that if you removed his events the film moves along just fine. I much prefer this to Age of Ultron. Yes! I’m glad to hear someone else agree with that point. The villain of the film was such a far cry from the actual comic book version which is okay, but he was so generic and his payoff wasn’t that impressive. Is that how you saw it? Too late indeed. And to be honest I thought that scene showed such an overused motive. Just didn’t work for me. But he is a smaller part to an otherwise great experience. I’m glad this film is getting an excellent response as I had fun watching it as well as the fact that it was willing to ask some big questions which is what blockbuster films should be. True. And not only ask the questions but be willing a to stick with them and explore them. Really caught me off guard (in a good way). Glad to see you had such a good time with this one. While I liked it, I definitely didn’t love it like the previous two films. Too little Captain America for my liking. You agree too? It didn’t feel like a Cap movie, right? Sure he was a main character but it didn’t have the intimacy of the other two. I thought you’d enjoy this, partly as a comic book fan but also because you enjoyed The Winter Soldier so much. This is a different kind of beast from the earlier Russo brothers film in many respects but it sits alongside it comfortably, and it’s one of the most fun times I’ve had at the cinema with a Marvel film. Liked the action scenes a lot, liked the new introductions, and there was a good blend with the returning ones too. I’m in a weird state where I’m trying to balance the old superhero fatigue with a desire to see standalone films for Black Widow, Black Panther, Spider-Man and Ant-Man sooner rather than later. I think I’d really dig a Bourne- or Bond-style Black Widow film. Marvel has done a really good job overall. I can see it being so easy to grow tired of these films. But they give us such fleshed out and compelling characters each with their own uniquenesses and identities. And then they give them good stories to tell. I also think their casting has been fantastic for the most part. Yeah, I agree. I think one or two of the villains haven’t been particularly memorable, but I think that’s down to the writing rather than the casting or anything the actors in question are doing wrong. Only Hiddleston’s Loki has really stood out for me, though if you take The Winter Soldier as a villain/antagonist, as he was in the last film, then I guess Stan was pretty cool too. (And I remember one great review of Thor: The Dark World where the reviewer asked the question ‘why would you take the most compelling villain Marvel have had to date and leave him locked up in a cell for an hour and a half?’, but I’m digressing now!) I agree. Not the best track record with their villains overall. I to think Winter Soldier was great even with his complexities. Hopefully they can make Thanos legitimately good as well. I too may the point that this could easily be called Avengers: Civil War, but if you did that, the absence of Thor and Hulk would be felt more and more people would be in more uproar.  But, I very much liked this film. Its success in handling 12 characters all at one is outstanding, but also the result of the universe taking its time over the years and actually giving their characters proper exposure, instead of being thrown into one big heap a la BvS. Probably not as good as Winter Soldier (liked that action a bit more), but still a great time and unlike AoU, you actually feel legit change. Great post. I so agree with you on several things most notably Winter Soldier, AoU, and how the universe has successfully built up these characters over time. It definitely has put the Avengers in an interesting place. Odd though, I knew all the others but I didn’t find myself invested in the battle. I also thought they kinda went overboard with the collateral damage part, they took about an hour just to introduce that theme! I do agree with you though that it is nice to see a film of this genre actually tackling such a theme, and doing quite well with it, even if I thought it was a tad overdone. For me, I enjoyed Bruhl as the villain, I thought he was great. I do agree though that his story was a bit scattered, definitely. His acting though was great I thought. And I’m with you that it could have been an Avengers movie. I think the best thing about this flick is how well they managed such a huuuuge amount of characters. Thanks for the thoughts. It is always interesting when people have different reactions. I do see where you are coming from. I just had a much different experience. I thought this one had a lot more heart and much higher stakes particularly on personal levels.  Bruhl’s performance was fine. Really good actor. I just found his character to be lightweight and his ultimate motivations were pretty weak. We’ve seen that so many times in so many movies. I think that was my main gripe about him. Great review Keith, I hope that the ripple effects follow through to Infinty War and aren’t just so easily resolved – just like in the comics.  I like the direction Marvel took with this and Age of Ultron, still fun superhero films but with a slightly more serious and thought provoking streak."
"Apr 15, 2022",positive," A cinematic superhero crossover to be reckoned with, Captain America: Civil War could have easily been a third Avengers film, given its dozen or more superhero characters; what’s more, it contains rather weighty themes of revenge and how to deal with the sometimes tragic consequences of superhero actions. Under the clear idealism of Chris Evans’ titular Cap, the film tunnels through an emotional core to discover more than just rousing superhero action (although there’s plenty of that, too). In fact, it’s superhero-against-superhero action, creating a whole film out of the best parts of The Avengers when the inner-squabbles between Earth’s Mightiest Heroes turned to blows. Among the best entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe thus far, the entire production of Civil War is a testament to the Marvel film factory, from its breathless set pieces to its sharp exploration of several characters, all within an intricate plot. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo, who helmed the gets-better-every-time Captain America: The Winter Soldier, show incredible confidence in their filmmaking, resulting in a rare superhero film of entertainment and substance on a huge scale. Arriving on the heels of another superhero-versus-superhero title, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Marvel’s film proves it doesn’t require a dour tone to deliver a comic book spectacular with gravitas. Nor does every action scene require pitch darkness and rain. Initially, Warner Bros. wanted their DC mash-up to debut on the same day as Civil War. Marvel wouldn’t give up the date, and perhaps out of uncertainty about their muddled film, Warner Bros. soon shifted their release to over a month earlier. A good thing, too, since the critical and fan reception of the former has been largely negative to abysmal, whereas Marvel’s latest confronts critics in fans but only in good ways. Indeed, writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (MCU writers since Captain America: The First Avenger) incorporate—perhaps unintentionally—an echo of the current political climate, where ultra-polarized parties can’t stop fighting long enough to solve any real problems, or think of the consequences of their in-fighting. And yet, the scripters imbue the material with plenty of levity during the 146-minute production, which somehow breezes by and feels light as a feather, despite some heavy stuff happening onscreen. Civil War was adapted from the limited 2006-2007 comic book series of the same name written by Mark Millar and penciled by Steve McNiven, one of the best comic storylines this critic (and former comic aficionado) has ever read. Just as Iron Man (2008) launched a bold new era of superheroes and The Avengers (2012) synthesized multiple heroes into an incredibly fun and engaging extravaganza, the adaptation of Civil War feels like a watershed moment in the MCU, both from a story perspective and in terms of pure filmmaking. Winter Soldier donned a ‘70s spy-thriller cover, Ant-Man was a heist comedy, and Guardians of the Galaxy was a sci-fi fantasy, but the strength of Civil War‘s narrative far outweighs the need to apply a preexisting genre. However, an in-film reference to The Manchurian Candidate wasn’t by accident; like John Frankenheimer’s 1962 classic, Civil War features a brainwashed character dealing with the emotional downfall of his condition. And like that film, it’s also paranoid, conceptually frightening, and challenging at every turn. At the end of Winter Soldier, Captain America and his friend Sam Wilson, aka Falcon (Anthony Mackie), began looking for Cap’s old friend Bucky (Sebastian Stan), a former mind-controlled HYDRA assassin on the run and trying to remember his earlier self. In the meantime, a series of public incidents (most prominently those in Avengers: Age of Ultron) has led world governments to conceive the Sokovia Accords, a document headed by the dogmatic Secretary Ross (William Hurt, reprising his role as the governmental nut from The Incredible Hulk), stating all super-beings are restricted from using their powers unless ordered to do so by the United Nations. Feeling a grave sense of responsibility for lives lost in Sokovia, Tony Stark, aka Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), signs away his superhero rights and asks others to sign as well. He’s joined by the synthetic person Vision (Paul Bettany), the military man War Machine (Don Cheadle), and shockingly Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), the latter of whom seems to see both sides of the argument, but refuses to fight the impending tide. Captain America doesn’t see registering or restricting his super-human heroism as a positive change; he views it as putting a committee in charge, possibly subjecting the Avengers to specific political agendas. He finds sympathizers in Falcon, the unpredictable Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), back-out-of-retirement Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), newly recruited Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), and eventually Bucky—though it was Bucky’s alleged activities in the first-half of Civil War that make any counterargument to the Sokovia Accord impossible. Those who refuse to sign and use their super-powers anyway become wanted; they’re soon tracked down by Ross and thrown into a floating prison in the sea. Inevitably, as Cap tries to protect his friend Bucky from those who would take him out, the ideologies implode, and friends face one another on the battlefield. From there, the story becomes more complicated with the inclusion of Daniel Brühl’s mysterious character Zemo, who schemes to get closer to Bucky for reasons unknown. Although the presence of Zemo should not be overlooked (Brühl makes a nefarious, tragically influenced villain), the most nuanced performances belong to Evans and Downey, as one might expect. Despite his character’s all-American frontage, Steve Rogers has been increasingly disenchanted by the modern world, his ‘40s idealism rocked by harsh doses of today’s cruel reality. Evans carries that pain under the surface with a just-detectable sadness beneath his unpopular optimism, and Johansson’s role furthers that sadness with her character’s similar duality. Downey offers Stark the first moments of genuine emotion we’ve seen from the ever-quipping character for several Marvel films, deepening his conviction and showing a more responsible, weighed down, and wounded character. Since both Cap and Iron Man are devoted to the ideologies concerning superhero registration, the depth of the team members who join forces with them are enhanced through association—though many of them may have only one or two scenes to shine. Still, the roles deepen even further by the final fight, inciting audible gasps at a late-film development that few will see coming, because it’s a horrifying revelation more than a twist. Most crucial to the story in terms of new Marvel characters appearing in the MCU is Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, aka Black Panther, whose African home Wakanda is the source of vibranium, and who gets his own solo film in 2018. When his father is slain, presumably by Bucky, T’Challa seeks revenge, but he’s not so blinded by his rage as other characters. Also appearing is youngster Tom Holland’s Spider-Man, the character brokered from Sony in a landmark deal. Though the teenaged web-slinging hero played a pivotal role in the comic storyline, it’s lessened here (somewhat of a letdown to the comic series’ readers, but no less welcomed. Holland shines in his few scenes. Though, this marks the third onscreen iteration of Spidey, and it’s hard to say yet whether Holland will surpass Tobey Maguire, though he shouldn’t have any trouble outperforming Andrew Garfield (we’ll find out for certain when Holland’s solo film Spider-Man: Homecoming debuts in 2017). The film also contains a fine supporting cast: Marisa Tomei makes her first appearance as Peter Parker’s quite young Aunt May; John Slattery and Hope Davis appear as Tony Stark’s parents; Martin Freeman has a distractingly small role as a task force commander working with Secretary Ross; Alfre Woodard, John Kani, and of course Stan Lee appear as well. There’s also a nice romance developing between Cap and Sharon Carter (Emily VanCamp), the former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent assigned to keep tabs on him and Peggy Carter’s niece. Each action set piece—with the exception of the shaky-cam opener set in Lagos, featuring Winter Soldier’s Frank Grillo as the villain Crossbones—looks amazing and showcases impressive choreography, stunt work, and special FX. This is all standard for the MCU, of course. When Bucky or Cap strikes someone, and that unfortunate person goes flying across the room, the audiences feels it as the poor sap crashes into a wall and leaves a dent (or flies right through said wall). Most impressive is the six-on-six battle at an airport, where the film’s engorged roster of superheroes clash in a wowing sequence. Here we see supporting players like Ant-Man (Rudd is as jokey as ever) and Spider-Man (also very talky, which Falcon points out) showcase their abilities in surprising ways. Fortunately, the potential for collateral damage has been mitigated in this rumble, allowing viewers to lose themselves the sheer spectacle of watching our favorite onscreen heroes do battle with one another, without risk of the needless death that incited the entire film. Only The Avengers outperforms Civil War in terms of earthbound size and scope. After the dust settles and our heroes have begun to lick their wounds instead of inflicting more of them, we’re left with much to consider about the role of super-powered characters in the MCU. It’s nice to know the filmmakers are weighing these ideas in a serious way. These superheroes inhabit a world in which people die; in that sense, it’s very realistic in spite of the inclusion of inter-galactic gemstones, gamma radiation mutants, and alternate spatial realms. The survivors of superhero violence have some very strong feelings about what’s happened to their loved ones. With any luck, some tense post-film debates will take place among viewers, because Civil War doesn’t provide a “right answer”, nor does it pick a side. Locking up superheroes who refuse to sign a piece of paper seems dangerous, because without them, a villain could do harm to countless innocents. On the other hand, how does the public reconcile when hundreds or even thousands are left dead after the events of The Avengers: Age of Ultron? Human beings need someone to blame when something bad happens, and super-humans are not immune to this. Captain America: Civil War creates a filmic conversation about this theme, and amid some remarkable escapist awe, leaves us thinking about its effect on our heroes in a purely dramatic way."
"Feb 14, 2022",positive," In the 8 years that the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been around, the films have gone from franchise/universe establishing films to a “they’ll come no matter what we give them” mindset. While no MCU film is overtly terrible, the last 2 films have shown the Marvel Cinematic Universe in sit back mode, as they have been concerned about their films continuing a story, rather than be an original film, adding depth and story to their characters. Captain America: Civil War has shown that when Marvel wants to, it can provide a breathtaking, action-filled, political drama, and a heartfelt story that will make even the casual film goer want more and more of it. While a big fan of the Civil War story arch in the Marvel comics, the path the Russo Brothers took with the film is just as breathtaking. The film’s importance of accountability leads to the tension between The Avengers. The government feels that the designated good guys are responsible for the deaths of innocents, despite the many they have saved. For this, a registration act is put in place in which the Avengers must register, abiding by governmental rules and requests. They can only act if they are approved to do so. This sets in motion a chain of events that leads to our superheroes taking sides and a back and forth fight that leads to one of the finest action sequences I’ve ever seen in film. The Russo brothers do not steer towards one side, as any cinephile watching this film will undoubtedly understand. They show both sides’ reasoning for signing and refusing to sign the registration act. The motives of each character are made clear and the new characters introduced within the film gain a strong development and purpose for being in the film. The added depth to Tony Stark and his character is a warm welcome, unseen since the first Iron Man. Robert Downey Jr portrays Tony’s internal conflict magnificently. The surprising, best in show performance goes to Tom Holland as Spider-Man. I have never been a big spiderman fan, but Holland stole every scene he was in and truly took Spidey right out of the comic book and onto the big screen the way we all have wanted for years. Captain America: Civil War is the best entry into MCU next to The Dark Knight, one of the best comic book films of all time. From top to bottom, this film is brilliant. DC Comics, take notes. This is not just how someone should direct a film, but what a comic book film should look like, and a great film should be."

"Oct 9, 2021",positive," As Marvel closes out its second phase of movies with Ant-Man, it opens up the next phase in their non-stop, superhero, money making machine with Captain America: Civil War. Seemingly the last in a trilogy of Captain America movies, Civil War is a strong opening to the third phrase. It addresses a lot of the standing issues after Ultron, it plays on all the most powerful dynamics within the Avengers, and it successfully brings in a new line of characters while strengthening the relationship between the cast. But, is it really even a Captain America movie? The plot deals with the traditional issue of superhero registration within the Marvel comic book universe, something that sparked the original civil war between superheroes, but the MCU has played it a different way. With the identities of all our superheroes leaked by Nat, keeping superhero identities a secret isn’t exactly a big deal anymore. Instead, they focus on oversight for the Avengers, signing what is called the Sokovia Accords — a document that places strong boundaries on the Avengers by the United Nations — intended to keep them in check. After the devastating results of Sokovia, the fall of SHIELD, and the attack on New York, the world feels more threatened than safe with the Avengers around. Tony, appropriately bearing a large part of the blame for Ultron’s actions, feels responsible for the deaths that they left in their wake. He’s ready for boundaries, because he honestly thinks that’s what they need. He’s a man who has never been kept on a leash, and after reaching the height of his own genius and hubris, he’s fallen fast and hard. Meanwhile, Steve sees the Accords as a shift of blame and a political tool. Instead of protecting the people, they can be manipulated by the terms of the Accord. Their agency is taken away and they are left simply as tools for the United Nations. All political powers have agendas, and what happens when their agendas don’t match? He’s a man who has been a soldier, he’s seen what power can be in the wrong hands. He’s not ready to be treated like a puppet. [Disney]Civil War feels much more like a story between Cap and Tony, they have a push and pull that they’ve been dancing around since The Avengers. Despite this being a movie with Captain America’s name on the billboard, it hinges heaviest on Tony. It touches on Tony’s past, on the Starks as a family, on Tony’s guilt, on Tony’s ego, on Tony’s pain and loss. You might be buying a ticket for Captain America: Civil War, but you’re actually watching Ironman vs Captain America: Dawn of More Avengers. While there’s nothing actually wrong with the movie — it touches on some very classic tropes of heroism and guilt and collateral damage — this is undoubtedly an Avengers movie. All of the fight scenes include the Avengers, all of the dialogue revolves around them, and its conclusion suggests more about the Avengers than Cap. This poses the question of whether it’s possible to have a standalone Captain America story ever again. If you were to only watch Captain America: The First Avenger and Captain America: Winter Soldier, you’d be lost. But that’s the confidence of Marvel Studios. They rely heavily on the fact that it’s target audience are loyal Marvel fans, and let’s be real, most of us are. Marvel has undoubtedly summited the mountain of popular opinion and come out on top. It’s becoming more and more obvious that, in order to keep up with the stories that Marvel tells, you can not be a casual viewer. [Disney]How will this fair for some of the lesser known Avengers in the group who are getting their own movies? There’s no doubt that Tom Holland’s Spider-Man will be safe after the incredibly gratuitous welcome he gets in Civil War, he’s projected to be welcomed into the MCU with open arms. What about Black Panther? Chadwick Boseman’s role as T’challa, the newly made King of Wakanda, is damn near perfect and his part within Civil War should chase away any doubt of the standalone film. Boseman’s performance is genuine and incredibly warm, and his story thematically falls in line with many of the other heroes. If anything, Civil War is a better launching pad for the future of the franchise than it is for Cap’s personal story. His momentous battle with Tony is poised as the climax in this film, but it is downplayed as he leaves with Bucky in tow and puts the Winter Soldier back into stasis. For many people wondering if either Sam Wilson or Bucky would pick up the shield after Steve leaves (especially with Chris Evans’ contract running out after Infinity War) it’s unclear what will happen. Steve drops his shield and abandons the mantle completely. It leaves us wondering where they are going to take the Avengers and Steve’s mantle of Captain America. Despite a confusion in titles and a protagonist, Civil War is a solid superhero movie. It widely surpasses Ultron, which feels clunky and suffers from delusions of grandeur, and it improves upon the same emotional quality of Marvel’s The Avengers, while adding more depth and better action. While facing the task of maneuvering a story full of main characters, the Russos manage to touch on each character a little bit while focusing on the civil war between Tony and Steve. Even with a huge cast that has the potential to drown out Cap, it still highlights some of the best aspects of Cap. He’s the golden boy and the ideal, he’s a good man who doesn’t feel disingenuous or overbloated. Sure, he’s the leader of the Avengers, but he’s still that underdog from Brooklyn. He’s incredibly likable and loyal to a fault. While there’s a lot to dislike about Tony — and really you could blame this entire thing on him — Steve can only really be blamed for wanting to see the best in people and trusting in them infallibly. [Disney]The scenes with Steve and Sam and Bucky stand in place of simply seeing Cap go at it alone, but the trio have such great chemistry together it’s actually a wise choice. Sam brings Cap down to earth and Bucky connects to the man behind the Shield, they both are able to treat him simply as Steve. Bucky’s role in Civil War, despite having the whole movie named after his character, is much larger than Winter Soldier. He plays an indispensable part of catalyzing the civil war, and Sebastian Stan makes a mark as one of the most interesting new characters that should see a rise in phase 3. Given his status at the end of the film, it’s a little unclear as to how that will happen, but as a fan favorite and given the depth of emotional treasure you can mine from his relationship with characters like Steve and Tony, it’s doubtful he’ll be in stasis for long. Daniel Brühl’s Colonel Zemo, who is more a catalyst than a true villain, Wanda and Vision’s relationship (and my surprise at Marvel actually attempting this ship with some measure of success), Ant-Man’s hilariously powerful new ability, Sharon Carter’s expanded role and relationship in Cap’s life, Chadwick Boseman’s origins as Black Panther, Tony’s surprisingly deep evolution as a character, and of course, the Amazing Spider-Man. Brühl’s adaptation of Zemo fits perfectly within the scope of the universe. He’s no crazed Hydra supporter, he’s a broken man bent on revenge. He’s another victim and creation of the Avengers’ callous decisions. He’s not a man without purpose, and he’s the first to understand that in order to defeat the most powerful team in the world, he must destroy them from the inside out. His plan isn’t to unleash super soldiers, but to lure them in and break the team apart completely to take away everything that the Avengers have taken away from him. If you’re keeping  count, he’s pretty much successful. He can call this op a win, even if he is locked away. Wanda and Vision share a romantic relationship within the comic books, and although it seems difficult to imagine in reality, Civil War actually takes the time to not only flesh out Wanda’s character and relationship with big-bro-Steve-Rogers, but also a potential relationship with Vision. Wanda is still pretty powerful within the MCU — lesser than her comic book counterpart — but she can really find an equal with Vision. The two of them share a connection through infinity gems, and I’m honestly looking forward to this weird relationship come Infinity War. [Disney]Paul Rudd makes a great entrance to the Avengers as Scott Lang, and is equally impressive in the Team Cap vs Team Ironman fight as he debuts his powers of maximizing himself into giant Ant-Man. If you somehow haven’t seen Ant-Man, you need to. It stands as one of my favorite MCU movies for working off the beaten path, and Scott proves himself to be a strong individual against the other Avengers. Also, “Hank Pym always said not to trust a Stark.” Same, Hank. Same. Emily VanCamp reprises her role as Sharon Carter, playing on her chemistry with Steve from Winter Soldier. Although it’s hard not to hold a torch for Peggy and Steve, this movie made a good case for Sharon. As a standalone character, she shares a lot of her Aunt Peggy’s personality traits; she’s tough, determined, loyal, and stands firm in her beliefs. Her interactions with Steve are compelling, but despite their budding relationship and its potential it feels a bit rushed to suddenly have him making out with her. This is a relationship that needs to be expanded on, and not pushed. There’s a lot of good potential for expansion between the two of them. A story that developed perfectly in Civil War was T’Challa‘s story. His mission of revenge really gilds the essential themes of the plot. When Crossbones attacks in Wakanda and the Avengers are sent out to deal with him, the mission ends in another building destroyed and more civilians harmed. T’Challa’s father is one of the leaders who calls for the Sokovia Accords, and when the UN Building is bombed (supposedly) by Bucky and his father is killed, it’s heart wrenching. Of course a superhero’s father dying is hardly striking at new ground, but it never fails to gain empathy if done correctly. His mission of revenge against Bucky fuels many of his actions, and yet his reconciliation of his vengeance plays out as authentic even if his revelation is largely off-screen. His interaction with Zemo, the true killer of his father, is muted and defined by nuance between the two strong characters. Boseman’s T’Challa is definitely one to keep an eye on. [Disney]Tony spends much of the movie being the most conflicting character. Although I rag on him a lot, and I share a pretty strong hatred for him sometimes, he is one of the most diverse and dimensional characters. He stands as a strong foil to Steve but also as a character that has truly grown from the first version of himself nearly a decade ago. Struggling with his actions and the results of his ego, he waffles between loyalties. Being Ironman hasn’t changed his personality, he’s still brash and arrogant, lashing out at his friends and allies when his temper flares, but he’s a man with more scars than when he started. He’s a much more broken man in Civil War; he and Pepper have hit a rough patch, he’s plagued by guilt, he’s haunted by ghosts, he’s just trying to keep it all together. The Accords are seemingly his penitence, and he readily signs himself away, hoping to absolve his sins. But not only does this cause a huge rift between his friends, but it does the opposite of what he hopes it to do. He wants resolution, some sort of peace for all the wrongs they’ve committed, but instead he only finds more conflict. Through the story, he struggles with Steve in trying to appease him and keep their group together. He locks Bucky away, he keeps Wanda in her room, he confines Steve and Sam, he does his best to conform to the wishes of the Accords while trying to preserve what he has. It’s a thin thread that keeps it all together, but it snaps so easily. He must fight his allies and his friends, he sees Rhodey suffer a shocking fall from the skies that paralyzes him, he uncovers the truth about the death of his parents, and all this culminates up to severing the Avengers. The end of Civil War only sees the beginning of a resolution between him and Steve through Steve’s letter. It isn’t an apology, but it’s a sort of understanding. The two part on bad terms, with Steve incapacitating Tony’s suit by slamming his shield into the arc reactor and leaving his shield behind. While this letter doesn’t settle their differences, it does open a path to potentially mending their group. It’s one of the most compelling relationships in Marvel, and the Russos do it justice. [Disney]And then there’s Spider-Man. Tom Holland makes his debut as the nerdy fanboy Peter Parker, already suited as an amateur Spider-Man and living with his (much younger) Aunt May, played by Marisa Tomei. And here is where I have a serious gripe with the movie. It’s very clear that they are playing out some of the most likable traits of Spider-Man, with his character largely being a caricature of the beloved webslinger. The way Tony recruits him, while funny given their pithy repartée, is rife with questionable motives. Let’s think about it: this is a minor, a teenager, that Tony plucks from a relatively safe home and recruits into his personal war. Tony doesn’t recruit him as an Avenger, he recruits him as backup for Team Ironman to face-off against Captain America. He brings in a child to fight his battles and be his muscle. Hell, Peter’s first impression of the Avengers is that they fight viciously amongst themselves and are willing to damn near kill each other in order to achieve their personal goals. Peter doesn’t make it out without some bumps and bruises from being tossed around. What Tony is willing to do and use the Avengers for seemingly has no limits. Even as he draws boundaries for himself, he continues to step outside of them. He’s a conflicting character and it plays heavily in characters like Peter and Wanda. [Disney]Some of the most problematic scenes lie in what happens to Avengers who step out of line. They are jailed and kept locked up without trial or jury, and while characters like Clint and Scott are simply locked up, Wanda’s imprisonment looks and feels so deeply wrong. She’s tied up in a way that harkens back to the days of asylums. He spends the majority of the film imprisoning Wanda in one way or another, and this type of protective-yet-restrictive characteristic really doesn’t look good on him. Ultimately, Civil War feels like more of a conclusive chapter for the MCU than it does as a new beginning. New characters are introduced, but the main plotline concerning the characters we already know is frayed at the ends and we are left with a massive weight of uncertainty in where we will go and how we will end up fighting together again during Infinity War. Final Thoughts: Captain America: Civil War is hardly the best Cap movie, it stands more staunchly as a fight between Steve and Tony, spending an equal amount of time on both characters. It is one of the most involved films in the MCU to date, requiring a vast amount of previous knowledge to understand the implications of the plot. However, after the tragically shaky plot by Joss Whedon for Age of Ultron, the Russos’ take on Marvel’s Civil War is refreshing and bookends two phases of the largely successful Marvel Cinematic Universe."

"Aug 27, 2021",positive," The great anticipation that’s been building up since the last Avengers film is finally over. Captain America: Civil War bounded into the theaters this past weekend with all the superheroes one could possibly want (with the exception of Thor and Hulk). Oh, well. I suppose we can’t have everything. Although billed as a Captain America film, it might as well have been “Avengers 3.” The film begins as Cap (Chris Evans) and Scarlet Witch/Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) fight some bad guys in Lagos. They win, of course, but Wanda makes a mistake and lives are lost. Back on home turf, Secretary of State Ross (William Hurt) tells them it’s time for a change. The Avengers need to take responsibility for their actions. They need oversight and the UN is willing to assign that oversight in the form of the Sokovia Accords. The Accords say that the Avengers will have bosses and the bosses get to decide where they go and what they do. Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) thinks they should sign the accords but Captain America does not. Captain America: Civil War delivers on every level. The eye-popping action moves the story forward and the humor brings the tension down a notch or two. My favorite parts of the big showdown between Team Cap and Team Iron Man were the introduction of Spider Man (Tom Holland) and Ant Man (Paul Rudd). Both went totally fan boy upon meeting the Avengers and as they fight, they throw out great one liners like, “You have a metal arm! Cool!” From the perspective of values, the film provides much to talk about. The central issue that causes the “civil war” is not a black and white one. Should they sign the Sokovia Accords and give up their freedom to exercise their super-ness as they see fit or give the say-so to others? Iron Man and his supporters want to sign for good reasons but Captain America and his supporters don’t want to sign for equally good reasons. But instead of sitting down and talking it out, they fight. If any of the Avengers were spiritual or religious people, they might have done well to ask the Holy Spirit for guidance. They still may have disagreed but maybe they could have avoided the fight, which had it’s own tragic consequences. As each Avenger chooses sides for his/her own reasons the opportunities to talk things out continue to diminish. The more personal wedge between Cap and Iron Man comes in the form of Bucky Barnes/Winter Soldier. The loyalty that Cap/Steve Rogers shows to his childhood friend made me think that every person should have such a fiercely loyal friend. The hurt suffered by Tony Stark requires forgiveness but Tony is not emotionally able to forgive. Again, neither one of them is right or wrong. They just approach the situation with different mindsets. Can they work it out? What might you do in this situation? I don’t want to give away anything by delving too deeply, but here are some other themes worthy of mindful conversation once you’ve seen the film: conviction, self-sacrifice, hurtful manipulation, taking responsibility, forgiveness, reconciliation, discernment, friendship, and justice.

"Aug 18, 2021",positive," In the long run, it’s unlikely the notion of Team Cap or Team Iron Man will take root in the cultural lexicon in the same manner as, say, Team Beatles or Team Elvis or even Team Boxers or Team Briefs, but that’s mainly because Team Marvel overpowers them both. In an era when superhero flicks hit theaters with the same frequency as bugs hit windshields, Captain America: Civil War still manages to rise above the fray and declare itself one of the finest pictures yet from Team Stan Lee. Or should this thing have been called Avengers: Civil War? It could certainly go both ways. With no less than 12 superheroes on display, this clearly isn’t a one-man show; at the same time, it’s apparent that Captain America (as always, played to perfection by Chris Evans) is the principal character in this chapter of the ongoing saga, more personally tied to the proceedings thanks to the involvement of his childhood friend Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), now known (and feared) as the Winter Soldier. Directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo and scripters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely are able to make Civil War feel like a direct follow-up to both 2014’s Captain America: The Winter Soldier and 2015’s Avengers: Age of Ultron. Intriguingly, it shares narrative material with the lambasted Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, with a discussion of whether superheroes should be allowed to roam — and fight — as they please or whether there should be some sort of governmental oversight when their actions lead to collateral damage. This issue comes to a head right at the beginning of this picture, as civilian deaths lead both the U.S. government (repped by William Hurt) and the United Nations to propose a resolution wherein the Avengers will only act when given permission by these bodies. And here’s where the movie really starts to flex its intelligence, since it would be logical to assume that the patriotic, by-the-book Cap/Steve Rogers would be the one to agree to this and the arrogant, maverick Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) would be the one to snort and walk away. But after the events of Captain America: The Winter Soldier, wherein Steve witnessed corruption at the highest levels of government, he’s no longer the all-trusting innocent, and he balks at this executive order. Stark, on the other hand, is haunted by a number of deaths — many at the hands of his creation Ultron — and he thinks that maybe the Avengers should be reined in a bit. The line in the sand becomes even more pronounced once Bucky is fingered for a terrorist bombing and Rogers comes to his aid, thereby establishing himself and his allies as fugitives. Some, like War Machine/James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) and Vision (Paul Bettany), strongly side with Iron Man. Others, such as the Scarlet Witch/Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) and Hawkeye/Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner), firmly align themselves with Cap. And with heroes to the left of her, heroes to the right, here’s Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), stuck in the middle. Black Widow (aka Natasha Romanoff) continues to be perhaps the most fascinating and complex character in this Marvel world order: smart, brave, witty, troubled, and able to read people and situations better than most of the others. She’s a dynamic figure — gee, you think somebody would give her a movie of her own. There’s very little that Captain America: Civil War does wrong. After Avengers: Age of Ultron, which allowed too much bloat to get in the way of some socko individual scenes, this one establishes a beautiful balance between quieter character-driven sequences and splashy action set-pieces (the airport skirmish goes on a tad too long for my liking, but since it’s clearly the movie’s showcase moment, others doubtless won’t complain). Tom Holland is introduced as the new Spider-Man/Peter Parker, and after the miscasting of Andrew Garfield in those underwhelming Amazing Spider-Hipster flicks, he’s simply divine, the geeky, motormouth teen we all know and love — along with Anthony Mackie’s Falcon/Sam Wilson and Paul Rudd’s Ant-Man/Scott Lang, he provides most of the film’s knowing laughs. Also new to the roster is T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman, further demonstrating his range following his Jackie Robinson in 42 and his James Brown in Get On Up), African royalty who dons the sleek duds to fight crime as the Black Panther. T’Challa’s involvement in the proceedings ultimately becomes as personal as Steve’s, and he figures in many of the picture’s best moments. Finally, there’s the villain of the piece: Zemo (Daniel Bruhl, so excellent as Rush‘s Niki Lauda), an ordinary man as opposed to the godlike likes of Loki and Ultron. Never missing a chance to add twisty issues of morality to their saga, Markus and McFeely provide even Zemo with enough backstory to make his reasons for his wrongdoing impossible to dismiss out of hand. And, yes, there’s the requisite cameo by the one and only Stan Lee. The Marvel maestro has now clocked appearances in over two dozen superhero films, but his brief bit here ranks among the best. So does the movie itself."
"Aug 5, 2021",positive,"  Now that they are 13 movies into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Marvel president Kevin Feige and the rest of his brain trust can do almost whatever they want and have it be successful. The latest, Captain America: Civil War, is an Avengers movie without being called one by name, a subtle difference that allows it to advance the larger MCU narrative while still telling a stand-alone story.  Following the last Captain America movie, The Winter Soldier, and Avengers 2, Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) finds himself at a crossroads personally and professionally. Fallout from Avengers missions around the globe have led to a call for greater oversight on the superhero group, an idea Rogers objects to but one which Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) thinks might be necessary.  When Rogers’ old friend/new nemesis Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) is accused of a bombing he may or may not have committed, the disagreement reaches a boil, pitting not only Captain America against Iron Man but also forcing other Avengers like Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Falcon (Anthony Mackie), War Machine (Don Cheadle), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) to choose sides.  Coming so soon after another superhero face-off in Batman v Superman, it’d be easy to dismiss this movie as a tired, unimaginative way to insert conflict where none is needed. But directors Anthony and Joe Russo and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely make the movie about way more than just the spectacle of the superheroes fighting each other.  For one, they keep the story relatively focused, allowing the details of the escalating argument to be laid out in precise and understandable terms. Side stories such as the introduction of T’Challa/Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) are integrated so well into the flow of the plot that they never become a distraction.  And they also introduce real, human emotions into the proceedings, a concept that is often foreign to superhero movies. The concern over the unintentional but tangible damage the Avengers’ exploits cause sets the stage for final act revelations that are relatable to anybody, superhero or not.  If you’re a fan of the patented lighthearted tone of the MCU, you won’t be disappointed despite the heaviness of much of the film. The big clash between the two sides is notable as much for its great action as it is for the quips that fly back and forth. The presence of new recruits Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland) help this aspect immensely; they're there as much for comic relief as for their fighting prowess.  Most of the actors have perfected their takes on their respective roles, leaving any critiques of their performances null and void. Newcomers like Boseman and Holland fit in seamlessly, while Daniel Bruhl offers a nice respite as the low-key villain Zemo. Captain America: Civil War shows that the overseers of the MCU have yet to rest on their laurels. If anything, given the coming onslaught of Star Wars movies and renewed interest in the DC Comics universe, this film indicates that they are redoubling their efforts to prove their dominance is well founded.

"Jun 30, 2021",positive,Is this the best Marvel film so far?
"Jun 24, 2021",positive," Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe kicked off with a bang. All of the Avengers, minus Hulk and Thor, are present in what is basically Avengers 2.5, and they’re forced to face the music for all of the casualties that they may or may not be responsible for while they’ve been off superheroing. Similar to the start of Phase 2, we start this section of the MCU with the end of the trilogy of one of our major heroes. Despite Civil War being filled to the brim with returning characters, as well as a couple of new ones, it is still very much a Captain America movie. When an Avengers mission in Lagos, Nigeria is botched and several civilians are killed, the United Nations comes together to draft the Sokovia Accords, legislation that would put the Avengers under government supervision, signed by 117 countries. Tony Stark, reeling from the consequences of his actions in Age of Ultron, and, well, every other film, is the first to sign up. Tony’s entire story has been about accountability and the dangers of unchecked power. “We need to be put in check. Whatever form that takes, I’m game. If we can’t accept limitations, we’re boundary-less, we’re no better than the bad guys.” Steve Rogers disagrees. As someone who has seen firsthand the problems of government authority and oversight, he knows that the safest hands are their own. Steve views signing the Accords as a way of throwing in the towel and not taking responsibility for their actions. To Steve, the United Nations is still run by people with agendas, and agendas change. “If we sign these we surrender our right to choose. What if this panel sends us somewhere we don’t think we should go? What if there’s somewhere we need to go, and they don’t let us?” There’s no real right or wrong answer here (though I’m Team Cap, all the way). Both sides of the argument have strong legs to stand on. Steve and Tony’s stances are directly influenced by their previous experiences and ideals throughout multiple films, and this is what makes Civil War the first real payoff for Marvel, for all of those years of storytelling. We know both characters like the back of our hand at this point, so we understand where both are coming from and why they choose the side they choose. This journey through eight years and twelve films have left us with quite an emotional investment, so the tragedy of what Steve and Tony’s disagreement turns into resonates strongly with any fan of this universe. While the plot of the film is a direct response to ending of Age of Ultron, it also is a continuation of the story that began in The Winter Soldier. Bucky Barnes has been on the lamb since the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D., but when he is framed for bombing the U.N., he becomes the number one target around the world. Steve buries his former love Peggy Carter, and now the only remaining part of the life he once had is Bucky, and he will do anything to save and protect his best friend, even if it means becoming an international criminal by assisting him. The final chapter of the Captain America trilogy seeks to explore the man behind the shield, and we finally learn how Steve Rogers may not be so perfect after all. Steve Roger’s flaw, and weakness, is Bucky. Steve is thrown off his game and hesitates at the mere mention of Bucky’s name during the mission in Lagos, which leads to the death of innocents. He forfeits his position as leader of the Avengers to find and protect Bucky, and is labeled as a war criminal in doing so. In the end, he gets half of the Avengers team hurt and imprisoned, and loses the friendship and respect of Tony, all in his quest to protect Bucky. Steve loves Bucky more than anyone. No matter how close he’s become to his friends like Sam and Natasha, they pale in comparison to his relationship with Bucky. Bucky was there for Steve when he had no one else in his life, and protected him through it all. Now their roles are reversed, and Steve cannot sit idly by while others seek to kill his friend, even if the consequences for doing so are steep. “How nice to finally find a flaw.” Zemo’s plan is to tear the Avengers apart from the inside, fueling the fire made by the Accords, until they can no longer function as a team and collapse. “An empire toppled by its enemies can rise again. But one which crumbles from within? That’s dead. Forever.” Zemo poses no physical threat to our heroes, challenging them instead strictly through scheming and manipulation. He has no ties to Hydra (in fact, he kills a Hydra agent during his quest) or any other evil organization. Throughout the film it even seems as if he’s questioning what he’s doing, having to listen to the final voicemail left by his wife over and over to remind himself why he’s on this mission. And once his plan is complete, with the Avengers splintered, imprisoned, and their two leaders fighting to the death below him, there is no glory in it for him, and little satisfaction. He listens to the voicemail one last time, deletes it, and then attempts to put a bullet through his brain. Zemo’s plan may be a bit convoluted, with too many moving pieces that are required to go exactly right at the exact right time, but he’s a fresh take on what a villain can be in a superhero film, and I think he’s a wonderful addition to the MCU. The many years and films that Marvel Studios spent world and character building are what makes Civil War work so well. It’s a film that you really do need to have seen the previous films to understand, and it takes all that’s come before to turn in a film that’s both a huge spectacle (the airport battle was the entire selling point) and an emotional gut-punch. The Russo’s are firing on all fronts. Between Winter Soldier and Civil War, they show that they truly understand each character in the MCU roster, and can deliver personal stories within a large cast. I struggle in deciding which film of theirs is the superior one, but both are the best of the best that Marvel has had to offer, and it’s why they’ve been entrusted with Infinity War and Avengers 4. Black Panther and Spider-Man are fantastic additions to the Marvel universe. T’Challa instantly became one of the coolest heroes with one of the coolest suits, and even with all that’s going on in Civil War, gets his own character arc centered around not allowing vengeance to consume him, as it consumes everyone else around him. Spider-Man just being in this movie is a miracle in itself, a pipe dream that I didn’t think I’d ever get to see. Tom Holland is tremendous, showing us in his first scene who Peter Parker is what he’s all about with his own version of “with great power comes great responsibility”. He and Ant-Man bring the fun and the laughs in an otherwise somber film. The Russo’s continue to show off their gift for crafting action sequences; the airport battle is the most fun and thrilling set piece since the Battle of New York in the first Avengers, and Tony and Steve’s fight is brutal, becoming the most violent and bloodiest conflict we’ve seen in the MCU thus far. Would Civil War have been better, more impactful, if one of the heroes had died? It would have definitely been more dramatic, but I like the Russo’s response to this: “Civil War is about the separation and divorce of a family. If we had killed someone off it would have turned into being about a death in the family instead, which wasn’t what we were going for.” Of course, that’s not to say that there are no consequences in the film, there are plenty. Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is about the end of what we know and what’s come before, as well as the birth of the new generation and the heroes they have to offer. The Avengers as we know them have to end and make way for the new, no matter how much it pains us to witness it. Iron Man’s trilogy ends with him choosing to always be Iron Man, even without his suits and weapons and gadgets. Captain America’s trilogy ends with him tossing his shield aside, and with it, the title and mantle of Captain America. The government he fought for has betrayed him, and the rest of the world has branded him a traitor and a criminal. Steve’s choice to stand firm in his beliefs against almost everyone else is solidified in Peggy’s death and hearing her words at the funeral. “Compromise where you can. Where you can’t, don’t. Even if everyone is telling you that something wrong is something right. Even if the whole world is telling you to move, it is your duty to plant yourself like a tree, look them in the eye, and say: No, you move.” Steve Rogers chooses to be himself, to operate under no orders but his own, and to protect the world and its people without a banner. “You wear a flag on your chest and think you fight a battle of nations.” The Red Skull says to him at the end of The First Avenger. “I have seen the future, Captain! There are no flags!” These words carry ominous weight all these years later. Steve’s identity is no longer tied to his country, nor is it even tied to the Avengers. Yet he is still the hero the country and the rest of the world needs. Even after their fight, Steve leaves Tony with a way to contact him if he ever needs him. And we know he will always answer the call, because he is what he promised to be to Dr. Erskine, the man who gave him his life and power. A good man. “If I see a situation pointed south, I can’t ignore it.” And he doesn’t wish he could. Captain America: Civil War marks a change in the entire dynamic of the Avengers and the MCU as a whole. It was the first satisfying reward for all of the time and years spent invested in these characters and the world they live in. The conflict is fascinating (I could watch an entire film of the characters just debating the Accords) and the personal stakes between Steve and Tony are heartbreaking. The team is split and scattered, leaving Earth wide open for catastrophe. That catastrophe is arriving in a big way very soon, and unless our heroes can reunite, they won’t be able stop it.

"Apr 27, 2021",positive," If Captain America: Civil War feels more substantial than most Marvel movies, it’s probably because it’s driven by a serious modern-day issue: accountability. After the ever-expanding superhero crew destroyed the fictional country of Sokovia in last year’s Avengers: Age Of Ultron, the U.N. wants them to be moderated by a governing body. Tony Stark aka Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) leads a faction of Avengers who agree to being regulated, while Steve Rogers aka Captain America (Chris Evans) heads up a group who oppose the move. This deftly sets up the “civil war” of the title, which intensifies when Rogers’ friend Bucky Barnes aka Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) is accused, perhaps wrongly, of committing a terrorist act. Stark wants to bring in Barnes for punishment, but Rogers is convinced his friend is innocent and sets out to protect him. Suddenly Iron Man is pitted against Captain America not just ideologically, but practically, sparking an fiery Avengers vs. Avengers battle that rages until the film’s finale. Along the way, sibling directors Anthony and Joe Russo (who also helmed 2014’s Captain America: The Winter Soldier) do a better job of juggling a massive cast than Joss Whedon managed on Avengers: Age Of Ultron. Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow and Martin Freeman’s new bureaucrat character Everett Ross are frustratingly under-used, but the Russos smoothly introduce two new Avengers due to star in their own movies: Chadwick Boseman’s Black Panther is grief-ridden and intriguing, while 19-year-old British actor Tom Holland makes a promising debut as a younger, more giddily enthusiastic Spider-Man than recent incarnations played by Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield.  The Russos’ action sequences are supremely gripping, especially a nerve-shattering scene in which it looks as though super-strong Captain America might have his arm ripped off as he tries to pull down a helicopter during take-off, but it’s the tighter plotting and constant sense of conflict that makes this a superior superhero movie. At 147 minutes, Captain America: Civil War is probably a bit too long, but it has enough tense head-to-heads and eye-popping fight scenes to override the odd drop in momentum."
"Feb 11, 2021",negative," Captain America: Civil War is the latest Hollywood superhero film. It is the 13th film from the “Marvel Cinematic Universe” alone. (There are more on the way.) The new Captain America is now the most commercially successful film of 2016, with its global box office revenue having reached $1 billion this past weekend. It cost approximately $250 million to make. The story of Captain America: Civil War involves a dispute within the group of “enhanced” creatures known as the Avengers over whether they should accept United Nations supervision of their efforts to combat threats represented by various “supervillains.” Governments worldwide have become concerned about civilian casualties, “collateral damage,” resulting from the Avengers’ destructive activities. Captain America / Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) leads the faction that opposes signing an agreement accepting UN regulation of the superheroes’ conduct. Ironman / Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) heads up those in favor. A terrorist attack that is falsely attributed to Rogers’ friend Winter Soldier / Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), the victim of insidious brainwashing years ago in Siberia, becomes the source of further conflicts among the Avengers, hence the “Civil War” in the film’s title. It turns out that someone is deliberately stoking the bitter discord in the group, hoping to fracture it permanently, because of his own personal grievances. Joe and Anthony Russo directed Captain America: Civil War. The action sequences, and there are many of them, are often difficult to follow. The relationships are simplistic and clichéd. There are a few amusing lines in the nearly two and a half hour film. There is also the nearly inevitable, vaguely anti-Russian angle. Overall, it is impossible to care about anyone and anything in this work. There are no coherent or significant themes here. Civil War seems to be suggesting that the thirst for vengeance is unquenchable and self-defeating. Every forceful action––even in a good cause––produces new, perhaps accidental victims, and those who attempt to avenge the latter inevitably perpetuate the cycle of violence. If this is meant to apply to the current geopolitical situation, to the wars in the Middle East and the terrorist attacks in Europe, it is less than meaningless, since it conceals the reality of relentless US and European military violence and neo-colonial aggression. With its fleeting, essentially inconsequential references to the deaths of innocent civilians, the Russo brothers’ effort deserves inclusion among those films and novels that accept––sometimes in allegorical form––the framework of the “war on terror,” but suggest that “good people” (or whatever form of life they may be) can “step over the line” and that there may be a price to pay for the overzealous pursuit of “evildoers.” In any event, the issues and dilemmas facing the characters, the gestures in the direction of “psychology,” are mere scaffolding for a large-scale money-making operation. What passes for film criticism is so prostituted in the US at this point that hardly anyone can state the obvious: that this is a bloated, pointless and dull film, which simply kills (truly murders!) a few hours in the viewer’s life. Laughably, Justin Chang in Variety, the trade publication, calls it the “most mature and substantive picture to have yet emerged from the Marvel Cinematic Universe.” More cynically, the Hollywood Reporter comments, “Call it ‘civil war’ or call it brand extension; call it a ‘cinematic universe’ or a corporate behemoth––the latest Marvel extravaganza furthers the studio’s cross-pollination of action franchises in a way that’s sure to satisfy devotees. Posing serious questions about violence and vigilantism while reveling in both, Captain America: Civil War is overlong but surprisingly light on its feet.” These comments are simply a form of product endorsement. The American media, instinctively subservient to corporate interests, treats the studios and their blockbusters as invaluable national assets that are “too big to fail.” It is a truly dreadful situation. Last July, in a comment on Terminator Genisys (2015), we pointed to the phenomenon of so-called independent filmmakers moving “into the ‘blockbuster’ vortex” as something worth “taking note of.” The Russo brothers were cited in that article as an example. They wrote and directed their first film, Pieces (1997), while still graduate students at Case Western Reserve University, in their hometown of Cleveland. Joe Russo told an interviewer that this initial movie “was a French New Wave-influenced, non-linear art piece that had no absolutely no appeal to anybody in commercial filmmaking.” He told another interviewer, “It was a genre-bending movie. It was about a heist, but completely absurdist in the style of a [Jean-Luc] Godard film,” and “[W]e grew up on foreign films, art house films. [François] Truffaut was a huge influence on us.” Thanks to Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney, who had a production company together, the Russo brothers made their first feature film, Welcome to Collinwood (2002). It was set in a rundown section of Cleveland and based on Italian filmmaker Mario Monicelli’s memorable comedy, Big Deal on Madonna Street ( I soliti ignoti, 1958), about a group of small-time thieves who horribly botch a burglary. William H. Macy, Sam Rockwell, Isaiah Washington, Luis Guzmán, Patricia Clarkson, Jennifer Esposito and Clooney himself featured in the amusing work. (Oddly enough, another “independent” filmmaker who has found himself directing bombastic fare, Alan Taylor [Thor: The Dark World, 2013, and Terminator Genisys], also began his career by directing a movie, Palookaville (1995), loosely inspired by Monicelli’s film.) The Russo brothers apparently played a role as well in developing the comic television series, Arrested Development (2003-06), eventually directing 15 episodes between them. After working on a number of other series, the Russos graduated to directing Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), and now this. They are slated to direct two more Avengers’ films, Infinity War, Part I and II, to be released in 2018 and 2019, respectively. All one can think about is the terrible waste of resources, technology and human skill represented by a film like Captain America: Civil War. The performers, for instance, include many talented individuals, among them Evans, Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, Daniel Brühl, William Hurt, Martin Freeman, Marisa Tomei, John Slattery, Hope Davis, Alfre Woodard and others. What are these people doing in this film? Is there any major film actor at present who would say “No” to this sort of project? In any event, the ultimate source of the problem lies in “bad times,” not bad people. What exists at present will be replaced by something very different, its opposite in many respects."
"Jan 6, 2021",negative," As with Captain America: The Winter Soldier, directors Anthony & Joe Russo and screenwriters Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely spend so much time ensuring Captain America: Civil War isn’t bad that they forget to make it actually good. Their plotting is as carefully-managed as their shot choices are incoherent and their character-building outright timid. This is fine for the CinemaSins crowd, for whom a film’s greatest virtue is to lack inconsistencies and contradictions (you know, human traits), but not for anyone interested in art or the human spirit. You’d think a career in such masterful, narratively economic sitcoms as Arrested Development and Happy Endings would make the Russos better judges of how to effectively sketch characters in a group dynamic, but all their resume really makes clear is the extent to which the conflict in this, like a half-hour comedy, just comes down to a crazy misunderstanding. Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) is feeling guilty. His career as Iron Man has left him estranged from his girlfriend, Pepper, and put him too close to death too often. He is, he hopes, on his way towards retirement. When yet another Avengers mission leaves dozens of innocents dead, a public outcry leads the United Nations to demand an agreement that would put the superhero team under international supervision. Tony’s in favor, partially hoping some added oversight will minimize “collateral damage,” and partially hoping the agreement will be the sort of compromise Pepper might approve. Tony, as always, remains the only major character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with more than one layer, and Downey the only star who’s developed his character through the series. Which brings us to Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), a.k.a. Captain America, who opposes the U.N. plan. He feels the Avengers only works because they know what’s right, and can’t count on ever-changing leadership to retain a moral compass. Adding to his concern, the international community is presently hunting one Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), Steve’s best friend from way back and, more recently, an expert assassin brainwashed by the villainous Hydra organization (see The Winter Soldier for this whole deal). Steve insists Bucky either never did anything wrong or was under mind control when he did, and isn’t wild about the shoot-on-sight order various government agencies have out for him. So he goes after Bucky himself, hoping to figure out what’s really going on. The rest of the Avengers – sans the inconveniently-powerful Thor and Hulk, but adding the less-destructive Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland) – are more or less split along party lines, conveniently aligning so that the balance of (super)power is not tilted in such a way that would decide the inevitable battle before it even starts. It’s unclear whether Helmut Zemo (Daniel Brühl), a shadowy figure manipulating certain events from afar, considered such balances as his evil plan slowly develops, but then he’s a pretty useless character anyway so let’s not bother with him any further. The film sure doesn’t. The general idea of Captain America and Iron Man divided over government oversight and leading forces of fellow superheroes to battle one another is inspired by a massive 2006 event story from the comics, but where that took forty years to build to and six months of innumerable tie-in issues to tell, the film compacts everything into a comparatively tight 140 minutes. The predictable effect has many supporting characters (Hawkeye, Ant-Man, and Spider-Man especially) fighting their friends for no discernible reason, and the teams form so quickly that those of us who didn’t watch the trailer fifty times mostly forget who’s on whose side when the battle comes. This would be tolerable if the much-hyped showdown was at all interesting. It’s horribly managed, pairing off various characters to fight one another in an endless series of fan-service sparring sessions that rarely relate to or build upon one another, and flatter than the pages it’s adapting. For as blandly-lit and unimaginatively-staged as their dialogue scenes are (it’s a shame the camera and lighting department wasn’t accounted for in Marvel’s massive budget), the Russos have an uncommonly bad eye for action. The opening espionage sequence is a mess of handheld camerawork that neither conveys what’s actually happening nor reaches the expressionist mayhem of our finer (vulgar) auteurs. A tunnel car chase is astounding in its conception and choreography, but only once you look past a shooting and editing scheme that lacks grace, grit, rhythm, or perspective. They cut incessantly, never motivated by a new action or development but simply to account for every set-up they produced. The Russos seem to have a camera everywhere without once putting it in the right place. They see everything and express nothing. It is remarkable, then, that the climactic showdown between Tony, Steve, and Bucky is so resonant. The stakes – once utterly arbitrary – are finally rendered in personal terms. Even Steve is allowed to act as irrationally as Tony, their selfishness and pride overtaking their plot-servicing motivation. For five or ten minutes, Captain America: Civil War becomes the film it has been insisting upon. But it’s the very definition of too little, too late, setting up a level of engagement it cannot resolve, because wouldn’t you know it, they’ve run out the clock and it’s time to wrap things up, too tidily and too suddenly. The film’s ideological sympathies were evident from the start, but by the end, they’re carried to too emotional a place to simply shrug them off. Usually such unconventional structure is admirable, but when it cut to the end credits at (by my estimation) the start of its third act, I felt shortchanged. For all their faults, Marvel has done a pretty good job of telling contained stories that contribute to a larger whole. Not here. This two-and-a-half hour film with two protagonists, nine key supporting players, and four other notable stars couldn’t even tell one story. Never mind narrative economy – where’s the story at all? Jesus, man. I’m not a fan of the MCU by any stretch, but this is downright scathing. It makes me want to see it more than a positive review would.  “…the Russos have an uncommonly bad eye for action. The opening espionage sequence is a mess of handheld camerawork that neither conveys what’s actually happening nor reaches the expressionist mayhem of our finer (vulgar) auteurs.” They relied so heavily on handheld vérité in Winter Solder, and made almost no effort to make it a piece with the parts that can only be real in a comic book. Here’s a neat scene of Cap fighting guys in an elevator, now here’s Cap jumping out of the elevator and falling 20 stories (ugly, needless Avatar-style handheld zoom) and surviving, and here is some helicopter shots of Cap leaping from a motorcycle onto a harrier jet and defusing it single-handedly. They use the style so they can avoid stylistic decisions, ones that would make sense, because their audience is undemanding children who need a minimal amount of semaphore to conclude that this is a “70’s-style conspiracy thriller”. Calum Marsh really nailed it when he said something along the lines of, “oh, so when you guys said Winter Soldier was a 70s-style conspiracy thriller, you meant a 90s-era James Bond movie.” This isn’t to knock the latter, as such, and I’m not even a gigantic fan of Three Days of the Condor or The Parallax View, but there’s a pretty wide gulf there. That serious people are still repeating this bit of ad copy two years later is…unfortunate. And I’m not against using vérité style amidst ridiculous stunts (I think the Bourne movies bridge this gap pretty effectively), but the Russos just don’t have a sense of how to utilize it. Everything “adds up” in that you can more or less tell what’s happening (really just the bargain-basement level of expectations on a movie that costs as much as these do). As you said, though, you still need to make decisions along the way – where to put the camera, how long to hold there, why you’re cutting when you do. Everything about their visual scheme suggests they just set up as many cameras as they could, anywhere they could, to ensure it would all “add up.” While I don’t necessarily respond super well to how the Russos approach action, I will say that their chaotic sensibilities seem to make more sense for a hand-to-hand combat type of film, which is what we had in WINTER SOLDIER (which is why the elevator sequence worked so well for me). Captain America as a character operates on a much smaller level than other superheroes, so it makes sense that the action would be cut from that Bourne cloth.
It’s only when the action requires a more epic scale (as in the big superhero battle in CIVIL WAR) that their instincts fail them. So I’m now officially worried about the action in INFINITY WAR, which will have a galactic scale that I don’t think they’ll be up to handling."
"Dec 4, 2020",negative," hen an assault on a chemical facility in Lagos breaks out, Captain America (Chris Evans) and several members of the Avengers, including Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Falcon (Anthony Mackie), and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), intervene to thwart the attempted theft of biohazardous material. But their involvement comes at a price. As numerous civilian casualties becomes the much-debated result of the Avengers’ latest efforts, additionally resurfacing countless other forms of collateral damage from previous earth-shattering clashes, the world demands accountability from the crime-fighting organization. 117 countries agree on the “Sokovia Accords,” a document outlining rules that the Avengers must follow, dictating how and when they can commit to action. But when the UN building in Vienna is bombed on the day of the signing, and Bucky Barnes, aka the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), is implicated in the attack, Captain America knows he must locate his elusive friend before the authorities do – in order to save his life. While the First Avenger heads to Bucharest to look for Barnes, an arcane threat works from the shadows to cause a rift in the superhero alliance. As Iron Man and Captain America are forced to take opposing sides, each leader recruits members old and new to aid in their fight for the truth. Clearly, this third Captain America movie might as well be the third Avengers movie. By anyone’s count, there are more superheroes here than in any of the previous Marvel epics. But, that’s also part of the problem. Following the downward trend for entertainment value in the X-men movies, this continuing chapter insists upon inventing all sorts of correlating types of kryptonite (or, more specifically, technology or supervillains or superweapons) to combat the new batch of superheroes. And each new hero, whether they’re extraterrestrial or some kind of mutant, has special powers that would make them utterly invincible – were it not for the convenient countermeasure always within grasp of the antagonists (and just out of reach of the authorities). Opening with the dullest of cold opens, “Captain America: Civil War” sets about establishing an exhaustingly circuitous plot of betrayal, infighting, espionage, terrorism, and covert operations. Inevitably, all of this will lead to a cacophonous showdown in some abandoned, arctic facility with revelations abounding. But, though a battle in icy confines isn’t farfetched, a sensible reason to bring every contending party together certainly eludes plausibility. In fact, the villain’s ploy is so unnecessarily complex that when the big reveal is finally laid bare, it’s almost laughable in its simplicity. As in last year’s “Terminator Genisys,” with just a few slight modifications, the film can easily undo the entire purpose behind its own existence. “I got lucky,” insists Natasha after she emerges unscathed from a massive bombing of a United Nations complex, which practically crumbles around her. Just like before, it’s a bit much to see normal humans (regardless of martial arts training) participate in hugely destructive skirmishes with alien beings and exceptionally advanced robotic warriors. It’s as mind-boggling as a scene early on when Rogers and Barnes attempt to escape a multi-story apartment building as it’s consumed by military commandos – and they, after agreeing to reform their deadly ways, go to great lengths not to kill any of their adversaries. But nothing stops them from seriously, seriously injuring the majority of the nameless, faceless soldiers. Despite the film’s excessive running time, and the tired concept of governmental oversight placed on superheroes (like “Watchmen” or “The Incredibles” or “Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice”) – the diplomacy and politics of uncontainable creatures spoils the fun of vigilante justice or the belief in superhero righteousness – there’s an undeniable element of fun to the action sequences. Although the backstories and character arcs are compounded to the point that seeing “Captain America: Civil War” is a little like walking into a random episode from the fifth season of a television series, the creativity involved with Ant-Man’s tech or Scarlet Witch’s inexplicable mastery of levitation (and red mist) or Vision’s godlike capabilities (which are also never given any definition whatsoever) provide numerous opportunities for high-octane action. And posing. Sadly, a touch of amusing fight choreography can’t save this overlong jumble of superhero cliches from succumbing to the absolute ridiculousness of nearly all the components that lead up to the anticipated civil war – as well as the silliness of Black Panther (a man who can apparently don a skintight black suit and retractable claws and gain not only invincibility but also the power to defy gravity and physics), an adolescent Spider-Man (who appears really just for the sake of one-liners), and hot Aunt May (Marisa Tomei, showing up for half a scene and half a line of dialogue).

"Nov 10, 2020",positive," As the 2016 movie season approaches its midway mark, it's time to check it on what's been great, good, bad, or just plain okay. More importantly, what you missed and need to see. Sometimes it takes a few days to truly know how good a film was. A bad one stinks right away. While this year hasn't produced a flawless gem just yet, there have been a few great ones. As the 2016 movie season approaches its midway mark, it's time to check it on what's been great, good, bad, or just plain okay. More importantly, what you missed and need to see. Sometimes it takes a few days to truly know how good a film was. A bad one stinks right away. While this year hasn't produced a flawless gem just yet, there have been a few great ones. Trust me, I never thought the phrase ""A Michael Bay film"" would come together with ""Top Movie Picks"" ever in my life. Sure, the Rock and Pain and Gain were something different but the near three hour brain bashing servings of Transformers films negated a lot of the praise. 13 Hours was something different. Taking a page out of Peter Berg's Lone Survivor book, Bay told the brutal yet true story of six former soldiers turned mercenaries who make the fateful choice to defend a compound against rebels overnight, risking life and limb. John Krasinski and James Badge-Dale led a tough game cast and the film packed an emotional wallop. When you left the theater, you felt a piece of shrapnel sticking out of your heart. The film stayed with you and provided Bay with his best effort. A truly visceral experience. Thank god Ryan Reynolds endured and wore Sony Pictures down over 10 years before finally getting the freedom to make his own Wade Wilson story. He knocked it out of the park, making arguably the coolest comic book film of the year and the most unfiltered take on the X-Men mercenary. The film plays well over multiple viewings and holds comedy to a higher standard than mere action and wise cracks. Reynolds takes shots at Sony, the X-Men, and anybody else wrong enough to stand in his path. The man has always been talented but this film takes the cake for bringing all his skills to light. Deadpool 2 can't get here soon enough. Comic book film fan or not, this film is a must see. Yes, I'm grouping these two different yet eerily similar science fiction stories together because they both resonated on different levels. The Jeff Nichols directed Special starred Michael Shannon and Jaeden Lieberher as father/son on the run from the FBI, religious cults, and various levels of authority in a mission to get to a certain location for a supposed special event. Telling you more would ruin too much and Nichols' heartfelt tale about the bond between parents and their kids deserves as little detail as possible. Special powers are involved and the end of the film delivers a sonic boom to your chest. 10 Cloverfield Lane is a sequel to 2008's Cloverfield in name only. Here, the freak is laid on thick as John Goodman keeps a confused yet willful Mary Elizabeth Winstead captive in a basement for her own safety...supposedly. Unpredictable thrills, twists, and wow moments ensue. Each film is an original piece of work that levels you with a creativity rarely seen in Hollywood today. Each are old school delights. Credit Jake Gyllenhaal for taking an ordinary looking role and turning it into something special and director Jean Marc-Vallee(Dallas Buyers Club, Wild) for giving him the space to embody Davis Mitchell with a wounded grace that allowed for unpredictable events to follow. The story of a widowed businessman who slowly dissembles his life in order to identify why he feels nothing after his wife dies in a car accident doesn't reinvent the wheel of film but truly carves a place in your heart for days after. You may think you know where this lovely indie is going, but you don't. Gyllenhaal, giving yet another great performance as a man running in place, doesn't hold a thing back without overdoing a single take. This film slipped past you once. Don't let it happen again.  The Russo Brothers are deadly, ladies and gentlemen. Yeah, two of my top five picks are superhero/comic book related. Deal with it because like its predecessor Winter Soldier, Civil War says more about the current vulnerable state of the world than most films and political talk shows can assemble in 2.5 hours. On the surface, it's one superhero against another. Deep down, it's two friends being separated due to a difference in idealogy. Oh, and there's Chadwick Boseman's fantastic tease of The Black Panther. Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans save their best work for this film because they make every punch and kick hurt and divide an audience into a cloud of confusion. Do you think heroes should be regulated or should they be able to act when they think it is right? What happens when the good guys square off against each other? Sure, Frank Grillo's Crossbones threw a wrench into their plans and Daniel Bruhl's Colonel Zemo lit the fire before the match, but this quarrel has brewed for a few films now. The result isn't just an exciting popcorn film but instead a cool and thoughtful expose on the difference between heroism and vigilantism. It was nearly two hours and 30 minutes and I didn't want it to end.  Are either of these films legit 5/5 films? Advertise in the middle of the street type cinematic masterpieces? Probably not. 2016 hasn't driven me to take a long walk after a movie(Fruitvale Station) or made me smile continuously for hours(Chef) nor left me with a worthy hole in my stomach(Lone Survivor or End of Watch). These six films are legit delights and require your attention. They offer something different. Exciting, honest, and thrilling. Watch them and tell me what you thought. "
"Sep 4, 2020",positive," When listing the credits for Captain America: Civil War, it was mighty tempting under ""Starring"" to simply put ""Everyone."" I mean, seriously, who isn't in Captain America: Civil War?  Here's the thing. It works. I admit this somewhat begrudgingly, but it's hard to picture too many devotees of the Marvel Universe being unhappy with anything that unfolds in this nearly 2 1/2 hour long widely anticipated adventure that plants more seeds than Invasion of the Body Snatchers.  Captain America: Civil War is neither as brilliant as some will proclaim it to be nor is it anywhere near a middle-of-the-road popcorn flick. In fact, Captain America: Civil War is a damn near perfect popcorn flick, though it is worth saying that it is, in fact a popcorn flick. In short, Captain America: Civil War serves up one hell of a good time but if the words ""one of the best films ever"" are flying out of your mouth then you'd best be a pre-teen, a masturbatory fanboy or a film critic prepared to fork over your journalistic credentials. After a year that has already brought us the satisfying self-importance of Batman v. Superman and the humorous nihilism of Deadpool, Captain America: Civil War is Marvel at the top of its game offering up what may very well be its finest cinematic effort yet and, at minimum, a film certainly in its top three. We're talking about the serious collateral damage when these superheroes do superhero things that don't quite always end up with superheroic results. You know? Like people die? A LOT of people die? A lot of buildings fall? A lot of, well, collateral damage is done? Apparently not for Secretary of State, played with appropriate bluster by William Hurt, though I could have sworn I saw Trump Tower somewhere in the background. So, it's decided that these superheroes, if they are to continue being superheroes, must somehow be held accountable under the ""authority"" of the United Nations. Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) align themselves with the charismatic Cap'n. Not particularly surprisingly, War Machine (Don Cheadle), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Vision (Paul Bettany) and, in a non-spoiler, Spider-Man (Tom Holland), a newcomer to the Marvel Universe. It also shouldn't be a surprise that T'Challa, also known as Black Panther, shows up and seemingly baffles everyone while Cap's longtime BFF Bucky (Sebastian Stan), also known as Winter Soldier, both gives and receives ample doses of conflict. If you've followed the entire series, and you have, then you already know that the Russo brothers, Joe and Anthony, have taken over directorial duties for the epically building series and aren't, in fact, leaving anytime soon. In some ways, it felt like we spent the first hour of Captain America: Civil War helping them catch up so we could move on with things. Once we did move on, Civil War was pretty much a non-stop blast. Captain America: Civil War may be too long and too much and too, at times, convoluted, but the Marvel universe is such a relational universe and such a consistently developed universe that one almost wishes the teams behind Hunger Games and the increasingly awful Divergent films would have taken a graduate level course in Marvelology (I made that up!) as a way of figuring out how to effectively develop multiple threads that actually mean something and actually go somewhere! Somehow, despite nearly impossible odds, Captain America: Civil War is both convoluted yet in the end makes perfect sense. Robert Downey Jr., who seems to have bounced out of his master thespian phase and full-on into his ""I can't believe they pay me this much effin' money"" phase, manages to dish up a nicely shaded and more emotionally complex Stark/Iron Man than we've seen yet in these films. Similarly, Chris Evans adds layers of emotional honesty and spark to Cap that help to give Captain America: Civil War an emotional resonance that sits comfortably alongside all those high-tech action sequences. Chadwick Boseman is a welcome newcomer as T'Challa/Black Panther, proving once again that Boseman is one of Hollywood's best of the up-and-coming actors. Tom Holland steals just about every scene he's in as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Both Boseman and Holland have upcoming stand-alone films - I can't wait. Captain America: Civil War isn't a flawless film, though I'm guessing most diehard fans will be more in awe of it than newcomers to the Marvel universe. As a non-fanboy, I was completely geeked out by Holland's Spider-Man, but I had little trouble both enjoying the film immensely and recognizing the errors of its ways. Despite some modest reservations, there's little denying that there's much to enjoy here in a film that does right just about everything that Batman v. Superman did wrong, though I happen to be one of the few film journalists who also gave Batman v. Superman a modest thumbs up. Intelligent, insightful, consistent and the perfect balance of action-packed meets emotionally meaningful, Captain America: Civil War sets everything up and makes sure that we absolutely fall for it."
"Jul 17, 2020",positive," With the Marvel Cinematic Universe showing no signs of slowing down, Captain America: Civil War is the latest addition to the franchise.  The question is – is it any good? I still hold a strong belief that The Winter Soldier remains the best Marvel film because it was self-contained, standing on its own merits without feeling like a set up for another film.  But I guess that’s just the nature of the Marvel Cinematic Universe now – the more they expand along with the characters they introduce (or re-introduce), every film will feel that weight of expectation and tease. Civil War suffers in that respect.  The longer the film went on, it went from being a Captain America film to Avengers 2.1.  It’s not necessarily a bad thing, just an observation. I’ve seen a few reviews online and it seems customary to slyly dig at Batman v Superman.  Well sorry to disappoint you but this review won’t head that way which I will explain why. The argument is pointless.  Civil War was always going to be head and shoulders better than Batman v Superman and that’s down to two factors.  One – Marvel’s experience, given how this is their thirteenth film since 2008 in comparison to DC’s two.  Two – whilst it’s not perfect and can lead to inconsistencies and formulaic structures, the familiarity and build up of the characters means that each film serves as an insight.  This combination ultimately and positively pays off in Civil War. But ironically (which some may overlook), Batman v Superman and Civil War tackle the exact same theme and plot points based on accountability.  It’s just that Civil War executes the ideology better. If you want an accurate and real measurable comparison for Civil War, then Batman v Superman is not the answer.  You need to compare this film to Avengers: Age of Ultron.  As mentioned before, Civil War is essentially an Avengers movie but also a better executed version of Age of Ultron.  The more I think about it, with exception of the introduction of Vision (Paul Bettany) and Scarlett Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), Age of Ultron doesn’t hold up well, essentially becoming nothing more than just a filler. Building off the success of The Winter Soldier, The Russo Brothers deliver a Marvel film with an actual consequence to the Avengers’ actions.  Given the history between Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) and Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), there is an emotional pay-off adding to the choices they made in becoming Avengers in the first place. So what makes Civil War stand out, especially in comparison to Age of Ultron?  Civil War is Marvel’s attempt to make a tonally darker yet serious film that mirrors real world politics about accountability and responsibility.  With exception of a few moments, there’s not many jokes or quips, keeping it to a minimum.  The jokes were a constant issue and distraction in Age of Ultron.  Following in the same direction as The Winter Solider, Civil War continues to explore the morality of war in a grounded fashion.  In other words don’t expect Thor or Hulk to show up. The division in the Avengers comes in the form of the Sokovia Accord (a change from the Superhero Registration Act in the comics), a document backed by the UN and issued by Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt), The Avengers must be kept in check, bounded by limitations to reduce the damage and danger to innocent people.  The first half of the film is a trip down memory lane guilt trip for the team followed by each member of the Avengers weighing up their choices in signing the agreement or not. For Tony Stark and Steve Rogers, their choices are impacted by personal experiences.  Tony’s relationship with Pepper is on the rocks and despite trying to do good, when he’s confronted by a woman who lost her son in Sokovia, his decision to sign is a no-brainer and tries desperately to get the rest of the team to follow suit.  For Steve, his choice not to sign comes from his belief to help people and when bureaucracy threatens to take away that freedom, the ability to do that job comes into question.  When The Winter Soldier, Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) is blamed for a terror attack, Steve finds more justification in his reasons not to support the Sokovia Accord. The clever thing about Civil War is that it never lectures you on which side is right.  It presents both sides of the argument, leaving the audience with the ultimate decision.  But with every decision there is a cost and that can take in the shape of Bucky’s mental torture as he tries to reconcile with his previous life and actions or Thaddeus Ross locking the Avengers up for their criminal activities, keeping them “safe” from the world. In the villain department, I still feel Marvel lacks a character that really tests the Avengers.  Whilst not perfect, Zemo (Daniel Brühl) does feel like an impactful upgrade in what we’ve seen in the past and wished the film delved more into his background instead of coming off as a simple plot device.  Zemo essentially does the same thing Ultron tried to do but actually accomplishes it by driving a real emotional division in the Avengers by fighting each other, something that Age of Ultron lacked in terms of payoff. In essence, Civil War doesn’t have a “villain” – it’s more about the choices that Captain America and Iron Man make.  When the battle lines are drawn, the team recruitment begins and thus becomes an Avengers film. Besides the brilliance of Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. who seamlessly fulfil their roles, the real standouts from Civil War belong to Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland). Black Panther – hell yes!  It’s great to see this character given the big screen treatment but most importantly, his appearance in Civil War is more than just a cameo.  His reasons for the fight go beyond the “which side are you on?” argument.  He’s not interested in their internal battle.  His motives are all about justice and he stands on his own, providing another dynamic to the story. Spider-Man on the other-hand is a cameo but a very enjoyable one.  Instead of an origin story we get hints to the back story, based on his interaction with Tony Stark who recruits him.  The gripes about the previous Spider-Man films start to fade away.  Peter Parker is not the loser, down on his luck nerd like Toby Maguire was or the cocky emo kid that Andrew Garfield played (which annoyed me).  This iteration showcases Peter Parker as the awkward yet smart nerd.  When he shows up as Spider-Man, the quips are not over the top or forced – he reacts like a normal teenager would if you were surrounded by other superheroes.  From the brief glimpses there’s a better balance for the character which I’m happy about. Civil War is also blessed with other character appearances such as Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), War Machine (Don Cheadle), Vision, Scarlett Witch and Ant-Man (Paul Rudd).  The good thing about the film is that everybody gets their moment.  It’s not an appearance for appearance sake and the film makes a real effort to showcase their opinion on where they stand on the Sokovia Accord.  The downside of that is it adds to the runtime.  It was not to say that I was bored, but because it veers off to other characters to establish them, the attention is taken away from Captain America.  In a way Civil War suffers the same problem with Age of Ultron.  With so many characters on-screen, the film can start to feel a bit overcrowded. The action scenes are another positive highlight from Civil War.  At times it can be breathless but with the tight cuts in the editing between punches, the other downside is that you don’t really get to see the action as the film mostly utilises the shaky cam approach from the Bourne films.  Plus the fights do go on for a while and there’s only so much punching and kicking before it starts to feel slightly repetitive. To end this review on a positive note, Captain America: Civil War is a good film and truly believe that the Marvel Cinematic Universe is in good hands with The Russo Brothers.  In both Winter Soldier and Civil War, their expert handling of the characters keeps you interested and most importantly, caring about their actions.  Whilst Captain America and Iron Man’s future was concluded in an open-ended fashion, it will be interesting to see where their relationship will evolve to next by the time Infinity Wars comes around. Civil War is a much more meaningful film and maybe in hindsight, they could have gone from Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man and skipped straight into Civil War. Agreed in full. Winter Soldier remains the one to beat, but Civil War gives it a run for its money. The casting is uniformly great; Black Panther was a great addition, and Black Widow not having her own movie at this point seems dumber by the minute. Also appreciated Downey Jr here – dialing back the motormouth lets him stretch his acting muscle a bit, making Stark less cocky, and more approachable. Thanks for the comment!  Yes at this point, it feels very silly that Black Widow doesn’t have her own movie.  She’s been more than integral to Captain America and the Avengers films than Hawkeye for example and Civil War is another case in the argument.  Even if it’s a mini-series on Netflix, her character deserves something…and some action figures in the toy section! Agreed on Downey Jr. as well –  brilliant performance and we get a different version of Stark.  He’s definitely a character who has gone through the motions since he became Iron Man and it’s great to see that explored again in the film.  The only nitpick I would have is Tony was so convinced in his justification to sign the Accord because of what happened in Sokovia and the young boy…then halfway through the film he’s recruiting a teenage version of Peter Parker to join the fight.  Felt a bit like double standards. Someone over at AV Club commented that it was Stark’s PTSD starting to show, and pointed out that the other characters called him out on bring Peter along too. It seemed a plausible argument. Maybe they’re setting something up for the next movie, or maybe it was just a result of “hey, we have to get Peter Parker into this thing”.  Bringing Spiderman along does feel like a bit of a setup for his eventual movie but yeah, I did think it was weird to see Tony switch from being guilty, then recruiting Peter and then halfway through the fight, he’s telling Peter to go home.  It was like risking his life for nothing unlike Black Panther who had genuine reasons for fighting.  I enjoyed reading your post. I really like how Marvel introduces new superheroes that I know little or nothing about and makes me excited for them. Vision and Black Panther are great examples of that, of course Guardians of the Galaxy are another. I literally got chills when seeing Black Panther in full costume and I loved that chase sequence. Thanks!  Black Panther was brilliant.  Really can’t wait until his solo movie comes out.  I think it will be a game changer.  As mentioned in my review, I just love he didn’t side with either Avenger.  He did his own thing and that was refreshing to watch in seeing a character operate within their own means instead of the usual good vs. bad mantra. I thought Black Panther would join in the fight at the end. But I like how he didn’t because it showed he didn’t side with any one Avenger, he’s on his own path. I thought they handled that well. Yeah they handled that aspect of his character very well.  I still don’t think this is Marvel’s best movie but it was certainly entertaining for what it was worth."
"Jul 9, 2020",positive,Civil War as a whole was a well done accumulation of previous themes and atonement for the events that occurred in previous Marvel installments.
"Jul 3, 2020",positive,This is the peak of Marvel's long form storytelling approach thus far-a jumping off point for things to come.
"Jun 29, 2020",positive," Phase 3 has officially begun! With the arrival of “Captain America: Civil War,” the new set of Marvel Cinematic Universe movies officially starts. Not only will we be treated to sequels to the fantastic “Guardians” and “Ant-Man,” but we will be introduced, and re-introduced, to several characters new to the MCU, such as one of my all-time personal favorites, “Doctor Strange.” This is also set to be the longest Phase, so far, and ‘Civil War’ kicks things off on a high note. When an Avengers mission accidentally causes the deaths of some innocent bystanders from the African country of Wakanda, the United Nations looks over all of the collateral damage the team has caused around the world, especially in New York and Sokovia (the climactic battles in the “Avengers” films). The UN comes up with the Sokovia Accords, which will effectively place the Avengers under the UN’s jurisdiction, where they will decide when and where to send the team.Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) is in favor of the accords, feeling responsible for creating Ultron, and all of the destruction that wrought. Captain America (Chris Evans) has more confidence in the team’s own abilities to regulate themselves and feels the UN might keep them from helping people based upon political agendas. This creates a divide within the Avengers, with some siding with Tony and some with Cap.Meanwhile, a mysterious figure named Zemo (Daniel Bruhl) is manipulating events in order to cast a negative public view on the Avengers as a whole. Some of this plan involves framing and, eventually, controlling the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), Cap’s old friend Bucky who, you remember, was turned into an assassination weapon for the Soviet Union during the Cold War. So, while the Sokovia Accords provides the wedge between Tony and Cap, it’s the question of Bucky’s innocence that becomes the hammer used to drive said wedge into place.“Captain America: Civil War” is essentially “Avengers 2.5,” and it’s all the better for that. It also makes sense. Over the course of his own two films and the two “Avengers,” Cap has become the team’s leader. So, you almost can’t tell a story starring him without involving a good number of the other heroes. I have a feeling this may be a trend for a lot of the character sequels going forward, too.Speaking of the characters, we get both an introduction and a re-introduction in this film. First, we are introduced to the Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman, Jackie Robinson in “42”). He is the prince of Wakanda, and he’s out for vengeance against the Winter Soldier, which puts him on Tony’s side. We also get, thanks to Marvel Studios’ reacquisition of rights, a re-introduction to Spider-Man (relative newcomer Tom Holland). He’s also on Tony’s side, and his introduction in the film is one of the best scenes.Speaking of best scenes, what you’re really waiting for is the big, central fight sequence where all of the heroes face-off in a giant (in more ways than one) melee. It’s exciting, edge-of-your-seat battle that is quite often very funny. When you have Iron Man’s snarky (or should I say “Starky?”) humor mixed with Ant-Man’s goofiness and pitch-perfect one-liners from Spidey, you can’t help but laugh while your heart is racing, at the same time.The film is also unexpectedly emotional. With the question of friendships and loyalties on the line, the plot does a good job of showing how these tensions honestly affect the characters deep down. They have been friends and teammates for a long time, seen and been through a lot of terrible things. They don’t want to be on opposing sides, but they all feel they have no choice in the side they choose. Also, we get closure for some storylines, and none of the heroes arrive at the other end of things unscathed in some way or another.“Civil War” is incredible, moves along quickly through its 2-and-a-half-hour runtime, and cements the fact that Marvel is doing things right and whatever DC is attempting with their movies is only a pale imitation. I’d like to get into the comparison of the 2 comic movie universes, but I don’t think the internet has enough room for a treatise that massive.On a side note:This week, you may have heard a lot about an app called li.st, developed by BJ Novak from “The Office.” I’m not usually one to jump on the bandwagon of brand new apps.

But here’s where it gets tricky. In order to make a good movie, you need a compelling story, interesting characters, and a way to bring the two together organically. Sounds easy, right? It gets even harder when we move into the world of blockbuster filmmaking. You have to factor in massive budgets, the desire of nervous executives stifling risk in order to maximize profits, and inexperienced directors getting swallowed up by their project.* These are all reasons why, when the summer movie season starts, many of us prepare ourselves for the onslaught of loud and stupid. Yet miracles happen. Blockbusters are released that not only have spectacle, but also intelligence and wit. Given how dysfunctional and cowardly the modern studio system is, it’s astounding that every year, populist entertainment of quality is released. I’m talking about movies like The Dark Knight, or Mad Max: Fury Road, or The Bourne Ultimatum. That trend continues with Captain America: Civil War, and it makes good on the promise of 2008’s Iron Man. Picking up after the events of last year’s Avengers: Age of Ultron, we’re re-introduced to a team of Avengers on a mission. Captain America (Chris Evans) is the team’s leader, and he’s joined by the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Falcon (Anthony Mackie), and the Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). The villain Crossbones (Frank Grillo), still a little testy after having had a building dropped on him in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, has targeted an infectious disease lab to steal a bioweapon, and the Avengers aim to stop him. But things go south, and an explosion rips a hole in a skyscraper, causing civilian casualties. For the world, this is the last straw. They’ve put up with an alien invasion in midtown Manhattan, helicarriers exploding over the skies of Washington D.C., and a psychotic robot laying waste to the European nation of Sokovia. It seems that every time the Avengers save the world, they reduce a good-sized chunk of it to smoking rubble. That’s why 117 member nations of the U.N. pass the Sokovia Accords. It directs that, instead of being a private paramilitary group, the Avengers will now be a task force with U.N. oversight. Sounds like a good idea, right? Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) certainly thinks so. Enhanced individuals like the Avengers need to be accountable to the world for their actions. Cap doesn’t like it. What if the team needs to intervene in a conflict, but politics prevent them from doing so? They’re both right, and this sets up conflict between Earth’s mightiest heroes. Things get worse when a bomb detonates in a terrorist attack and Cap’s BFF The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) is implicated. A victim of decades of brainwashing, he’s a walking killing machine who has rediscovered his conscience, and the U.N. directs the Avengers to hunt him down. Cap sets out to prove his innocence, kicking off a series of escalating skirmishes between factions of heroes. Throw into the mix the warrior-king Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), who has his own bone to pick with the Winter Soldier, as well as your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man (Tom Holland). There’s also the mysterious Zemo (Daniel Bruhl), who’s murdering former Hydra operatives, and has his own shadowy connection. For anyone other than an unrepentant nerd like me, this movie shouldn’t work. It has a running time of nearly two-and-a-half hours, numerous subplots and over a dozen heroes punching, blasting, shrinking, magicking, and thwipping. It’s directed by the guys who made You, Me and Dupree. On paper, this is again a thing that rhymes with clusterduck. But look a little closer, and you’ll see why Civil War works so well. Joe and Anthony Russo, the directors of the aforementioned clusterduck, also were heavily involved with the beloved TV comedy Community. They learned how to effectively balance a large ensemble cast, how to portray emotion through action, and how to cleanly shoot an action scene with creativity. As a result, they’ve made a film chock full of propulsive plotting and kick-ass fight scenes. More importantly, the know when to slow down for character beats to let the film breathe. Some of the best moments are between characters who care deeply about each other arguing. Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have been part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe since they wrote 2011’s Captain America: The First Avenger. As much as I dig Joss Whedon and the excellent work he did on the previous Avengers movies, Markus and McFeely are a big reason why the Captain America movies are really the crown jewels in the crown of the MCU. Whedon occasionally has a nasty habit of having his characters sound the same. But Markus and McFeely go to great pains to make sure that every character, even those with minimal screen time, have their own unique voice. They know that one of the aspects making the conflict so compelling is that we like the characters on both sides.** Plus, as much as the movie might seem like Avengers 2.5, this is at heart Captain America’s story, and they never forget it. It also helps that the supporting players are bringing their A game. I’m pretty confident that most people’s favorite character will be teenage wise-ass Spider-Man. Tom Holland’s Peter Parker is a good kid, but he’s also an inexperienced ball of enthusiasm who gets by through equal parts luck and skill. As the Black Panther, Chadwick Boseman is an intriguing mix of soulfulness and nobility. Even folks with limited time, like Jeremy Renner’s I’m-too-old-for-this-superheroing marksman Hawkeye, Scarlett Johansson’s shadowy pragmatist Black Widow, or Paul Rudd’s gushing fanboy Ant-Man, make indelible impacts. Nobody gets left behind. Robert Downey Jr. has played Tony Stark six times now, and this is easily his best portrayal of the billionaire playboy philanthropist. He’s raw, going through trauma, guilt, and anger. The trademark snark Downey has brought to the character of Iron Man isn’t the default emotion, but it’s a defense mechanism, and you can track how he’s grown and changed since the first Iron Man film. Downey is one of the world’s biggest movie stars, but people sometimes forget that he’s an excellent actor, and that skill is on display here. For years, people pointed to Christopher Reeve’s portrayal of Superman as the platonic ideal of a superhero performance. As the good Captain, Chris Evans is right up there with him, equal in every way. He’s the beating heart of the MCU, a guy who does the right thing not out of revenge or loss, but because it’s the right thing to do. It would be easy to make Cap a hopeless square and a guy who’s always right. But maybe he lets his friendship with the Winter Soldier blind him. Maybe he’s escalating the situation out of selfishness. Cap has also changed since his first appearance, and seeing Evans guide him into morally murky waters is terrific. So, rejoice, since we live in an age of marvels. Captain America: Civil War is muscular filmmaking, but never at the expense of character or ideas. Every time you think it’s going to become overstuffed, it provides you with a joke, or a sincere moment, or a thoughtful point of view. Is it the best film in the MCU? I’m not sure yet, I need to see how it speaks to me over time. But if it’s not the best, it’s pretty high up there."
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,"In the end, Captain America: Civil War is an entertaining film while dealing with complex human emotions."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"  The emotional stakes are high in Captain America: Civil War, a film that ditches overt threats to humanity for a conflict borne from the characters’ beliefs and their love for the people who matter to them the most.  With Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice behind us and X-Men: Apocalypse looming, some moviegoers might wonder why this year our superheroes can’t all get along. Civil War shows why. This is a movie about actions and consequences. Perception and reality. Regret over roads not taken and guilt over the ones that were. Loss and acceptance and change. It’s a film where characters are haunted by relationships in their pasts that affect the present. Grief is here, too, but whenever anger drives these people, no one can think clearly.  Directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo, who helmed 2014’s Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, who wrote that film as well as 2011’s Captain America: The First Avenger, know these characters well. There are setups from the earlier films—the most significant being the childhood friendship between Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) and Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan)—that pay off here in both poignancy and motivation. Cap’s shield might defy the laws of physics, but the characters behave in ways that track not only with other Marvel films but in a way that makes sense within the film. The script draws on characters’ histories as far back as 2008’s Iron Man to show how and why they’ve arrived at where they are today. Yet even with a full slate of characters—and a running time of 147 minutes—it never feels overstuffed or slow.  When an Avengers mission to recover a biological agent results in civilian casualties, Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) says the world’s nations are tired of the heroes’ collateral damage. The proposed solution: the Sokovia Accords, named after the fictional country blasted to the sky in 2015’s Avengers: Age of Ultron, which would regulate when and how the team operates.  When they met in 2012’s The Avengers, Cap and Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) initially dismissed each other as an antiquated fossil and a loudmouth in a high-tech suit. A World War II super soldier living in the modern age, Cap finds purpose in protecting others as he struggles with melancholy because most of his peers are gone. Technological genius Tony tended to shoot or create first, then ask questions later.  Though they earned each other’s respect, experiences since then have changed them. Tony, already feeling guilt over creating the malevolent artificial intelligence Ultron, is doubly ready to reign in his independence once a grieving mother confronts him about her son’s death in Sokovia. But Cap, having learned in The Winter Soldier that the government agency S.H.I.E.L.D. was poisoned from within, is skeptical of any authority beyond the people he trusts.  Once the philosophical lines are drawn, a new villain (Daniel Brühl of Inglourious Basterds) stirs the pot, ultimately forcing the heroes to decide where their loyalties lie. Barnes—himself reprogrammed through the ages as an assassin a la Jason Bourne—is blamed for more mayhem, sending Cap and Falcon (Anthony Mackie) off the grid to find him. On their trail is Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), an African warrior King with a vendetta against Barnes. Meanwhile, Tony, Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and the others scramble to figure out how to help within their new restrictions.  Similar to The Winter Soldier, Civil War balances the clash of ideas with action sequences that are enjoyably fast-paced and easy to follow. We know who’s against whom and who’s doing what, making it even more thrilling when tanker trunks and repulsor blasts fly. The film is full of solid performances, especially Stan as the troubled killer who’s not sure he’s worth his friend’s support; Boseman (Get on Up, 42), a mix of coiled rage and dignity as the first black superhero in mainstream American comics; and Tom Holland (The Impossible), a delight of teen awkwardness and geeky charm as Spider-Man. Spidey and Paul Rudd as Ant-Man pack gleeful surprises as two fanboys who hold their own even as they’re overjoyed to be tapped as reinforcements.  There are callbacks to the other Captain America films, such as when Tony asks Peter Parker what drives him much like the way the scientist behind the super-soldier program wondered what made a gangly Steve Rogers tick. It’s no spoiler that in both cases, these heroes have unselfish hearts.  Heart is all over this movie. These characters care about one another like a family even when they disagree. And when they come to blows, there’s a layer of trying to stop the people you love from hurting themselves or making a situation worse.  Evans sometimes gets short shrift for not having Downey’s firecracker charisma, but he’s always had the trickier task of making an inherently goodhearted character compelling. Here, he shows how Cap continues to evolve while retaining his sincerity and decency, making the Star-Spangled Man perhaps the most hopeful comics character onscreen right now, especially given the DC film universe’s darker tone with Superman."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"Captain America: Civil War is a fun time at the movies, and among the best of its breed, but you can be excused if you feel superhero fatigue setting in."
"Dec 15, 2019",positive," (Welcome to Road to Endgame, where we revisit the first 22 movies of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and ask, ""How did we get here?"" In this edition: Captain America: Civil War pays off years of build-up by injecting politics with personal impulse.)The Marvel Cinematic Universe tries to re-invent itself every few years, albeit within a limited narrative formula. From scrappy ""real world"" solo films, to fun, landscape-shifting crossovers, to alien family dramas, the series has been laying track for its two-part finale — Avengers: Infinity War and the upcoming Avengers: Endgame — for quite some time.A decade of narrative investment in the superhero genre, especially in a series that aims to be so political, can't be achieved without a feeling of loss. Last year, after having been scattered by the events of Captain America: Civil War, the Avengers were finally defeated.While no Avengers lose their lives in Captain America: Civil War, the team tears itself apart from within; they may as well have lost their identity. The series' long-term personal and political narratives finally boil over, clashing with one another for reasons both idealistic and petty, opposing impulses that are (rightly) framed as a continuum. It's a harrowing watch at times, despite building on its predecessors' confused politics. Debates about military intervention rage on in the real world, and as of Avengers: Age of Ultron, the Avengers' legacy finally began to stand in for America's. That legacy is complicated, and Civil War finally grants the series an element it had been missing for nearly a decade: deeply personal drive behind political ideology. In Civil War, Captain America's (Chris Evans) journey away from blind nationalism comes full circle, though it leads him to an unsettling place: now a self-appointed interventionist, he represents American militarism once more. It's a fine line for a narrative to walk, one the film acknowledges by positioning its well-meaning, destructive protagonist at odds with his equally well-meaning-yet-destructive teammates. None of them are particularly wrong, and for once, a Marvel film being unable to draw a singular conclusion about military power feels textually justified.After a botched mission resulting in civilian causalities, the Avengers are put on notice by a returning General Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt), now the U.S. Secretary of State. Ross, who was last seen in The Incredible Hulk, is all too familiar with the dangers of unchecked power. He hands the Avengers the Sokovia Accords, an agreement signed by 117 countries that would place Steve Rogers and his team under U.N. supervision.The Accords makes sense, at least in theory. A U.S.-based private military outfit has no business running unchecked missions on foreign soil, especially when they're half the reason these villains crop up in the first place. Like several other films in the series, Civil War differentiates between the American government and a fictional group meant to stand in for its faults. However, it articulates the retaliatory element of geopolitical conflict that's often ignored in western cinema, especially in the Marvel series.Military-funded Marvel movies like Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Captain Marvel were each made from scripts approved by the U.S. Department of Defense. In the first three of these films, global military conflict was framed either a status quo for American forces to respond to, or as flames stoked by outside actors for selfish motives, rather than something America had a hand in. In Civil War however, the first villain the Avengers face has a personal grudge against Captain America. From the perspective of Brock Rumlow, a suicide bomber, Steve Rogers is the reason he's scarred, and exists without a country. Later in the film, primary villain Helmut Zemo (Daniel Brühl) is revealed to have a similar vendetta against the Avengers; Zemo's family was collateral damage to the Avengers' reckless interventionism.Captain America isn't keen on being supervised. Not out of some vaguely jingoistic notion of ""freedom,"" but because he's seen the American agenda change over time, both in The Avengers and in Captain America: The Winter Soldier. This leaves him in an interesting position. He is, at once, opposed to the U.S. government's idea of militarism, as well as its very embodiment, ready to go to war at a moment's notice.Rogers opposes the corruption and duplicitousness that often drive foreign intervention, while still adhering to its core methodology. In prior films, Steve Rogers was never given a clear ideological enemy, and so his own outlook was never allowed to grow beyond the broad strokes of power. Here, as if to finally course-correct this omission, the series uses his divestment from ideology as a dramatic question: who does Captain America truly fight for, if not interests he, and he alone, deems worthy? Like Steve Rogers, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), a former arms supplier, comes back around to embodying an element of the U.S. military apparatus. But where Rogers represents interventionism, Stark now represents the government control to which he himself was once so thoroughly opposed.Time and time again, Stark has seen his technology misused. In his previous appearance, Avengers: Age of Ultron, he created an antagonistic A.I. that nearly destroyed the world. Ultron was defeated, but not everyone got out of Sokovia alive. When confronted with the death of one such individual — Charles Spencer, a young American on a mission to build affordable housing — Stark's guilt finally forces his hand.No more private militarization. No more unilateral intervention. The Avengers need oversight — but under whose authority should they be placed? The group wouldn't be needed in an ideal world, the kind of world that has been Stark's objective since Age of Ultron, but the old world of war and misery is one he helped create in the first place.For Steve Rogers, doing the right thing means refusing to compromise on his moral outlook. For Tony Stark, doing the right thing means correcting his mistakes. The overlap between these objectives is where the film's conflict is born. Both men were reminded of their missions by their dying mentors — Abraham Erskine in Captain America: The First Avenger, Ho Yinsen in Iron Man — and those missions, which now form the core of who they are, have finally collided.Rogers, once loyal to the structures of western government, has been forced to turn against the very idea of structured power. Stark, once a man obsessed with his own unchecked might, now believes it's time for governments to take charge. Not only have Rogers and Stark seen the folly of their ways — having faced the most dangerous parts of blind loyalty and deregulation respectively — they now see the worst parts of their own past decisions within one another. Per the words of the late Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), Steve Rogers must remain an uncompromising protector, and respond to those telling him to move with a resounding ""No. You move"" (a line taken straight from the Civil War comics). When Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) tells Rogers to move in Germany, he refuses. When Iron Man tells him to move in Siberia, he refuses once more.In either case, Rogers is protecting his best friend Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), whose crimes, both recent and in the past, may not be his own. Rogers' uncompromising loyalty to Barnes, however, is a character flaw that functions the same way blind nationalism would. Captain America may no longer serve the stars and stripes, but he's shackled by the same emotional instincts.Rogers knows that people need to be protected, and he refuses to wait for their safety to be debated by committee. This is his overarching political outlook as it pertains to the Accords, but it's rooted entirely in personal bias. He took similar unilateral action to save Barnes during World War II, and he carries this lesson forward in a more complicated world he doesn't fully understand. He could be right about circumventing approval to save lives, but he may be right for all the wrong reasons.For Tony Stark, a man trapped by traumas and past mistakes, the guilt of his actions has become too much to bear. No matter how many times re-lives the past through virtual reality — like his final conversation with his parents — he's unable to change it. The only results of his obsession are a broken relationship, and an electromagnetic headache that he nurses with pills. When confronted by the mother of Charles Spencer, who blames him for her son's death, he has no choice but to try and fix the future. Though, his reasons aren't so forward-thinking.The Accords aren't just a political document for Stark. They're a means for him to prevent more damage to his soul. Not long ago, Stark was America's military industrial complex. Now, he's a protector unable to move past his own destruction.Getting the Avengers to sign the agreement may not prevent future tragedy — as Rogers rightly asks, what if the Avengers aren't where they need to be, or intervene somewhere they shouldn't? —  but it's a step that shifts the responsibility away from Stark and his team. It's selfish, but it's exactly what Stark needs, though he's unprepared to admit it. Wanda Maximoff's (Elizabeth Olsen) civilian casualties in the name of protection would have been equally tragic if the mission were approved by a governing body, but at least Stark would have a clear conscience.Where Steve Rogers' political outlook is rooted in attachment to the past, Tony Stark's is grounded in his desire to detach himself from it. When Steve Rogers is close to signing the Accords, he's forced out of his decision by factors that feel like personal affronts, whether Tony Stark imprisoning Wanda at the Avengers' compound, or military forces going after his wrongly accused friend, Bucky Barnes. Rogers knows Barnes to be innocent, both for prior crimes in which he was denied autonomy, and for the recent U.N. bombing that killed Wakanda's King. Signing the Accords, at first, could result in Rogers being sidelined, and in lethal military force being used on Barnes instead.If Rogers waits to be taken in, or if he waits for a committee to decide on whether to intervene in Zemo's apparent plan (the re-awakening of more Winter Soldiers), the world could be at risk. If Stark doesn't stop Rogers from his reckless mission, the unstable, malleable Barnes could cause further harm, and the Avengers could be shut down for good.This rift is why the massive airport fight ensues, between those loyal to Captain America — Barnes, Wanda, The Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Hawkeye (Clint Barton) and Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) — and those who have fallen in line with Iron Man and the Accords — Black Panther, War Machine (Don Cheadle), The Vision (Paul Bettany), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland). Both parties are ""right,"" in that they're justified from their own perspectives, which makes the ideological conflict between the two factions engaging. Additionally, Captain America is the film's protagonist, and so we, the audience, have the same information he does about Zemo's plan — information Iron Man's team does not.This lapse in information adds stakes to the narrative, over and above the enjoyable cognitive dissonance of good guys squaring off. However, the set-piece itself, while a fun reprieve from the conflict (and some of Marvel's most enjoyable action since The Avengers) remains disconnected from the rest of the film. Light-hearted though it may be, it feels half-hearted too. It's laden with Marvel's signature quips and rip-roaring action beats, but dramatizing interpersonal conflict through action might have been a more suitable choice. The Avengers fight, but nobody really seems in danger — Hawkeye and Black Widow even joke about pulling their punches — which works in opposition to the film's own premise about the consequences of these battles.The scene does eventually shift toward a more serious tone while setting up the climax — an untrained Vision accidentally injures War Machine, thus solidifying Stark's position — but the scene lacks any real emotional punch until that point. The airport sequence, fun as it may be, is at odds with what follows. It's immensely rewatchable on its own, but in-context, it's lacking.  The film's ensuing rug-pull reveals that both sides were factually wrong. In effect, they aren't fighting for the people anymore. They're just fighting, as they were in the Civil War comics, though their battle on the page carries far more weight than their battle on-screen. The futility of their violence in the film is overshadowed by the fact that it feels like an enjoyable field trip.Thankfully, the film proceeds to foreground its emotional heft in the scenes that follow, as the story is re-framed in a manner that makes the next battle between heroes — Iron Man and Captain America — feel appropriately harrowing. By shifting its major set-piece to the middle of the film, Civil War also sidesteps a climax steeped in Marvel's signature pre-visualized action, the kind often divorced from story. Instead, the film narrows its spotlight to focus on a tale of deeply personal conflict. Helmut Zemo's mission is complicated. It depends on dozens of moving parts, and on the Avengers making precisely predicted decisions. Zemo claims to have studied the Avengers closely, so his place in the narrative is as much a scorned antagonist as it is an invisible, meta-textual hand (Your mileage may vary). His scheme feels improbable in the real-world, but guiding the Avengers to these specific outcomes feels less like plot contrivance and more like catalyzing that which was already narratively inevitable.Every decision Zemo orchestrates is rooted character, set up not only during Captain America: Civil War, but across multiple films. He convinces Tony Stark, with his newfound sense of authority, to believe he's the only one who can stop a dangerous fugitive. He also makes Steve Rogers believe his friend Bucky Barnes (the very mention of whom blinds Rogers' decision-making) is in grave danger. He makes Captain America's side of anti-establishment, gung-ho freedom fighters believe their actions will stop terrorists, while making the establishment itself, Iron Man's team, believe they're stopping future catastrophe by coming down hard on their own people.In effect, Zemo magnifies and accelerates what was already under the surface, bringing the Avengers to conclusions that feel like logical outcomes of who they are.But Barnes is not the real terrorist, and Zemo has no plans to re-awaken the other Winter Soldiers. As complicated as the Avengers' security debate is — and as harrowing as it may be to see heroes placed at such fundamental odds — Zemo takes advantage of predictable, one-track American military heroism (the way Aldrich Killian did in Iron Man 3), a self-aggrandizing modus operandi, rooted in emotional instincts to shoot first and ask questions later.The two sides clash at a Leipzig Airport because they have each been made to believe a different terrorist narrative. They are placed predictably at odds because even their differing outlooks are merely sides to the same fundamentally violent, militaristic coin. Team Iron Man retaliates without complete information. Team Captain America fights on the false presumption of future threat. Destruction ensues.Zemo has personal motives for this mayhem: his family was killed in Sokovia during the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron. To ensure Captain America and Iron Man's fuses are lit, Zemo lures them to the isolated facility of Barnes' Siberian origin. Here, he reveals the truth that Arnim Zola hinted at in Captain America: The Winter Soldier (an admittedly blink-and-miss setup, makings the ""twist"" feel sudden to those not in-step with continuity). Bucky Barnes, while under the influence of H.Y.D.R.A., murdered Tony Stark's parents to prevent them from assisting American war efforts. The man Steve Rogers has been protecting was the very person responsible for Stark's deepest wounds, a truth Rogers has been aware of for years.The political specifics are stripped away by this point. Both sides have come to realize the lies that brought them here, but the personal perspectives driving them have now been magnified. Tony Stark, who has spent years trying to regain a sense of order and control, is now faced with the man who destroyed his sense of equilibrium, Bucky Barnes. Steve Rogers, who has spent the entire film doing what he thinks is right, has to both protect Barnes from what may well be righteous vengeance, and face retribution of his own, now that his unwavering moral outlook has caused irreparable harm. Stark is right, Rogers is right, and they tear each other apart.With the question of Barnes' guilt or innocence hanging in the balance — How accountable, and to whom, is a brainwashed soldier for crimes he believed righteous? — the selfishness driving each hero's ideals comes to the fore. What good is Rogers' desire to do right by Barnes when it's hurting Tony Stark? What good is Stark's newfound adherence to law when he breaks it himself?What good are these debates on security when they're being had by wounded individuals driven by selfish ideology, rather than by common good? Individuals whose sole focus is deciding on the means by which to attack, rather than the means by which to curb their violence altogether? 
Apart from Black Widow, who's woefully short-changed after two stellar appearances, every character in Civil War gets a coherent story arc. Sam Wilson/The Falcon, a former military airman who's witnessed American governance be twisted, sides with Rogers. James Rhodes/War Machine, an Air Force recruit whose 130+ missions have prevented catastrophe, follows Stark. They each side with friends who represent their personal worldviews, despite the conflict's complicated political dimensions. And they each pay a physical price.Wanda and The Vision battle on opposing sides, despite their common and mysterious origin (the Mind Stone). Wanda, having been at the receiving end of military conflict fights to make a difference. She escapes her confines despite being held back by her guilt (Hawkeye, once again, convinces her to stand up for herself). The Vision however, knows Wanda is volatile, and claims an objective, unemotional stance in protecting people from her. He throws mathematical equations at the Avengers and calculates what decisions they ought to make ""for the greater good."" However, the realization of his own humanity — that his perspective is informed by emotion, and that he's prone to human error — makes him retreat from the fight. As a creation of the Avengers themselves, he is, once more, a microcosmic representation of a conclusion they must arrive at: that neither side is ""objectively"" right.Even newcomers Spider-Man and Black Panther receive their due. Young Peter Parker is recruited into battle by Tony Stark, and delivers a version of his uncle's ""With great power comes great responsibility"" line from earlier films. Where The Vision's ""objectivity"" is built on the false presumption of emotional distance, Parker's moral outlook is vital precisely because he's removed from the conflict. He likely doesn't know about Sokovia Accords (we see him learn about them in school in subsequent films), yet his perspective applies to either side. When you have the power to prevent catastrophe, and you don't, the resultant harm is your fault. This holds true for both warring parties, who find themselves locked in debate about what power to lean on in the first place: the power to legislate when to act, or the power to act without legislation.Black Panther on the other hand, while involved deeply in the political turmoil, turns his gaze toward personal vengeance. His mission is to kill Bucky Barnes, the man he thinks responsible for his father's death. However, he comes to his senses once he sees his vengeful quest reflected back to him — both in Zemo, whose obsession has led him to madness, and in Rogers and Stark, who descend into senseless violence over Barnes. Black Panther chooses justice instead of revenge, capturing the man responsible rather than leaving him to die.The narrative driving Civil War — Captain America and Iron Man switching places and perspectives before finally butting heads — is a payoff that could only exist in long-form storytelling. The film finally confronts the series' haphazard politics, imbuing the franchise with a new reason to be political in the first place. Marvel's muddled approach to militarism can no longer simply be a backdrop for the heroes to respond to; in stories that question the use of power, political outlook must be an extension of ethos itself, just as it is in the real world.Granted, the political perspectives here remain just as abstract as in previous films. At no time are there specific examples that parallel real-world intervention, but the film leans hard on the personal biases that often drives these decisions. Changes of heart aren't enough when they exist alongside lies and unconfronted histories. From this point on, the series begins to dramatize this need to investigate the past, in films like Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther. Come Avengers: Endgame, the past will likely hold the key to the Avengers' future.It hurts to see your heroes fall, and it hurts that it may take a global annihilation to bring them together. Their failures in Captain America: Civil War tear them apart, revealing the fragile, paradoxical nature of even the most powerful interventionist forces, setting the stage for a dramatic reunion.The original Avengers, including Steve Rogers and Tony Stark, are among the few heroes left standing in Avengers: Infinity War. Moving forward, a question the series might need to answer, if it hopes to close its loop, is whether the Avengers will settle on a way to wield their powers responsibly.

However, the realization of his own humanity — that his perspective is informed by emotion, and that he's prone to human error — makes him retreat from the fight. As a creation of the Avengers themselves, he is, once more, a microcosmic representation of a conclusion they must arrive at: that neither side is ""objectively"" right.Even newcomers Spider-Man and Black Panther receive their due. Young Peter Parker is recruited into battle by Tony Stark, and delivers a version of his uncle's ""With great power comes great responsibility"" line from earlier films. Where The Vision's ""objectivity"" is built on the false presumption of emotional distance, Parker's moral outlook is vital precisely because he's removed from the conflict. He likely doesn't know about Sokovia Accords (we see him learn about them in school in subsequent films), yet his perspective applies to either side. When you have the power to prevent catastrophe, and you don't, the resultant harm is your fault. This holds true for both warring parties, who find themselves locked in debate about what power to lean on in the first place: the power to legislate when to act, or the power to act without legislation.Black Panther on the other hand, while involved deeply in the political turmoil, turns his gaze toward personal vengeance. His mission is to kill Bucky Barnes, the man he thinks responsible for his father's death. However, he comes to his senses once he sees his vengeful quest reflected back to him — both in Zemo, whose obsession has led him to madness, and in Rogers and Stark, who descend into senseless violence over Barnes. Black Panther chooses justice instead of revenge, capturing the man responsible rather than leaving him to die.The narrative driving Civil War — Captain America and Iron Man switching places and perspectives before finally butting heads — is a payoff that could only exist in long-form storytelling. The film finally confronts the series' haphazard politics, imbuing the franchise with a new reason to be political in the first place. Marvel's muddled approach to militarism can no longer simply be a backdrop for the heroes to respond to; in stories that question the use of power, political outlook must be an extension of ethos itself, just as it is in the real world.Granted, the political perspectives here remain just as abstract as in previous films. At no time are there specific examples that parallel real-world intervention, but the film leans hard on the personal biases that often drives these decisions. Changes of heart aren't enough when they exist alongside lies and unconfronted histories. From this point on, the series begins to dramatize this need to investigate the past, in films like Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther. Come Avengers: Endgame, the past will likely hold the key to the Avengers' future.It hurts to see your heroes fall, and it hurts that it may take a global annihilation to bring them together. Their failures in Captain America: Civil War tear them apart, revealing the fragile, paradoxical nature of even the most powerful interventionist forces, setting the stage for a dramatic reunion.The original Avengers, including Steve Rogers and Tony Stark, are among the few heroes left standing in Avengers: Infinity War. Moving forward, a question the series might need to answer, if it hopes to close its loop, is whether the Avengers will settle on a way to wield their powers responsibly."
"Dec 3, 2019",positive," The Marvel war party presses on, overrunning the multiplexes this spring with Captain America: Civil War, a movie so stuffed to the gills with characters that naming it after Steve Rogers’ alter-ego is a bit of a misnomer. Rather than unifying to fight against a common enemy, the Avengers are fractured. One faction, led by Captain America (Chris Evans), doesn’t want to answer to the government, while the other, headed by Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), feels responsible for the bystanders who have died during past battles. It doesn’t really make too much sense and the sides feel randomly drawn, but at least we get some really cool fight sequences when all our heroes have a go at one another. Clashes featuring superhero-on-superhero action have long been a staple of the Avenger wing of the MCU films. The first Avengers movie felt more like a Capcom video game than an actual film of substance. This is why Captain America: Winter Soldier stands as one of the better films in the MCU. Instead of figuring out innovative ways for Thor to battle the Hulk, directors Anthony and Joe Russo crafted an action movie dedicated to just one character and the moral quandaries that come with protecting a friend who has clearly done wrong. The Russo brothers are back in the director seats again, but Civil War feels much more akin to Age of Ultron in its multifarious characters, plots and locales than the focused narrative of Winter Soldier. I’ve always taken issue with the scenes of mass destruction that rip through comic book films, usually at the climax. So many landmarks and buildings have been destroyed, yet we never feel the human cost that comes with so much devastation. In Civil War, screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely predicate their story on the innocents who become collateral damage when superheroes and villains fight. When the US government mandates that the Avengers adhere to the United Nations, Captain America worries that kowtowing to bureaucrats will destroy the Avengers. Tony Stark, however, wracked with sadness after more civilians are killed in a botched operation in Lagos, wants to work with the UN. Enter Captain America’s old friend Bucky (Sebastian Stan), the Winter Soldier, who has been brainwashed by the Russians to do horrible things. With his loyalty torn between the Avengers and Bucky, Rogers chooses to go rogue in an effort to clear his friend’s name. Tensions escalate and then it’s all-out war as a litany of Marvel heroes show up to fight one another. For some reason, we don’t get Thor or the Hulk, yet Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and the new Spider-Man (Tom Holland) join the melee. At least new hero Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) is here for a reason, and Holland’s spirited performance gives us something to look forward to next summer when Marvel reboots the Web Slinger’s franchise yet again. Though Civil War teases a climactic battle with five fearsome new villains, Markus and McFeely never follow through with this new threat. Instead, the climax comes when Rogers and Bucky must battle an enraged Iron Man. The Russos definitely know how to stage an action scene, yet the final showdown is a bit of a letdown, especially when the hinted-at melee against these five new villains never materializes. But who cares, right? We want to see folks like the Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) go at it rather than some nameless baddies. It all comes back to that climactic fight where the Avengers try to kill one another at an airport. It’s a no-holds-barred throw-down where each character gets to flaunt his or her superpower. Yet, like everything in these comic book movies, there is absolutely nothing at stake. Even when one character plummets to the ground, you know he isn’t toast. There are too many different franchises involved to kill anyone off. And even if they did, how many movies would it take for them to be resurrected? Early Water doesn’t have much of an arc — after all, it’s a rehearsal tape. But it does have a surprisingly plentiful array of textures and transitions within its somewhat narrow parameters. "
"Nov 19, 2019",positive," On the heels of Avengers: Age of Ultron, the Marvel heroes are left frowned upon by much of the world. After all, it was Tony Stark's fault that Ultron was created in the first place. Now, back in the United States, Captain America finds himself being governed into not being a hero at will. His biggest objection to this comes from the need to help his best friend, Bucky Barnes, after he is accused of a horrible crime. Stark, on the other hand, feels the weight of his actions in Sokovia on very intimate levels and sides with the government. At no point during Captain America: Civil War does one character seem ""more right"" than the other, and it's a remarkable achievement. Everything the filmmakers and cast members said about audiences being truly divided turns out to be true. Captain America is not only fighting for something he believes in but what he believes in is credible and organic to the film's story. The same can be said for Iron Man. When the fights begin, the action is second to none. Despite being thirteen movies in, Marvel's team found ways to innovate the action packed scenes by capitalizing on each character's abilities and chemistry with one another for impressively creative sequences. The team has worked together for a while now (both in an on-screen and behind-the-scenes capacity) and it is clearly conveyed on the big screen. Speaking of the team, having (almost) the entire ensemble cast of heroes together (minus Hulk and Thor) is something to be admired. The Russo Brothers had previously directed the acclaimed Winter Soldier edition of the Captain America trilogy, but that effort was much less dense. This time around, they were burdened with bringing in over a dozen already established characters while also introducing two new major heroes. Each character, though, is given their own arc; none are forgotten or overlooked. While some are larger than others, it is equally delightful to see Scarlet Witch and Vision's relationship explored as it is to see Captain America break the rules in an internal struggle. Even though Civil War packs a lot of characters into its runtime, it is still very much a Captain America film, another filmmaker promise made good. It takes the points of The First Avenger and The Winter Soldier that were left open-ended and builds upon them. That said, the film also does a great job telling Iron Man's story. The last time we saw Iron Man outside of an Avengers movie, he blew up his suits for his girlfriend, Pepper. The consequences of not following through on that promise, going back and continuing to make new ones, are thoroughly displayed here. The characters many fans are both most curious and most excited about going into Civil War are the newcomers: Black Panther and Spider-Man. Chadwick Boseman steps into the T'Challa role and Tom Holland jumps gleefully in as Peter Parker. The two couldn't possibly be more welcome additions to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Black Panther's arc is the most complete and noteworthy of the film. Spider-Man in action is the best it's ever been. The two characters were handled masterfully and fit right into the mix of characters without standing in anyone's shadow. In fact, there are times when they may put our existing Avengers into shadows of their own. The character who was unfortunately given the short end of the stick in Civil War was Daniel Bruhl's Baron Zemo. While Bruhl clearly poured himself into the role, the villain was the least interesting part of the film. As the momentum built between the heroes, audiences are taken to completely different locations to see what the manipulative menace is up to, only to wish they were still seeing what's going on between Cap and the tin man. As far as Marvel villains go, Zemo is arguably the darkest. Shades of Batman v. Superman's Lex Luthor can certainly be seen here The villain is cruel. His methods are more brutal than typically seen in the traditional Marvel Studios film, raising the stakes. As a whole, Captain America: Civil War is the darkest Marvel movie to date. That doesn't mean it gets serious and gritty throughout - the one liners and boat loads of fun are still there - but it tackles issues and emotional moments like no film before it. Everything that worked in The Winter Soldier is emphasized and exploited. The emotional beats never missed. There are moments that will have audiences audibly gasping. There are themes of friendship, love, heartbreak, and fear, which are blended seamlessly. For the comic fans, Civil War will certainly satisfy. While it's far from an exact adaptation of the original Marvel comics, it's not too far to see its roots. There are beats from the pages splashed right across the silver screen, and anyone thinking the movie needed more heroes to do the story justice was wrong. The airport battle scene teased in the trailers could be watched on a loop for three hours and still be worth the price of admission. It's quite possibly the pinnacle representation of where movies and technology stand today. By its end, Captain America: Civil War alters the Marvel Cinematic Universe more than any film before. The Avengers are truly left shattered heading into Infinity War and the audience is left begging for more. While it's hard to compare to the most unique film (which is Guardians of the Galaxy), Captain America: Civil War fights its way to be the best Marvel movie so far, as the studio continues to find ways to outdo themselves in emotion, action, and character.

"Nov 3, 2019",positive," To the horror of many of my colleagues in the press and evoking a chorus of gasps and boos from them at the recent press junket for CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR (although Paul Rudd cheered and Kevin Feige lit up like a Christmas tree), I dared to say that which apparently should not be said: CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR is BETTER than “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.” I said it then, I’ve said it since and I say it again now. While “The Force Awakens” is a global phenomena filled with touchstones of the past 40 years that tap into and tug at every fiber of one’s being, the puzzle pieces are not as integrated within the film as a whole as those in CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR. Hands down, CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR is not only better than “The Force Awakens”, but the best film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the best film of the year thus far. Screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, who have been with the series since “Captain America: The First Avenger”, know this world and the characters intimately, and take advantage of that, going deeper with exploration into the psyche and emotions of each, expounding on and/or introducing backstories that are interwoven within the film’s fabric, while developing situations and storylines that allow for exploration of themes that challenge the limits and boundaries of not only themselves, but their individual and collective places in an ever-changing world. Akin to the United States’ own Civil War, here we have brother against brother, friend against friend, as Markus and McFeely, together with directors Joe Russo and Anthony Russo, delve into the ideals of free will, the ability to choose, responsibility, self-sacrifice, self-satisfaction, vengeance, forgiveness and redemption, addressing an uncompromising code of ethics within Steve Rogers, Captain America himself. There is no longer a clear cut “right or wrong”. A maturity permeates the film and each character as we see each “grow up.” Although there are still enough smart-aleck one-liners bandied about, they are scaled back in number and tempered, most notably within Robert Downey Jr.’s Iron Man, replaced with thoughtful questioning and self-examination. These characters, the collective Avengers, have long gone beyond being “comic book heroes”. There is a real sense of humanity now embedded in the on-screen fabric of reality and life as we know it, with each Avenger facing the same crisis of conscience and self-questioning as each of us, resulting in friction and conflict that serves as the catalyst to the brother against brother CIVIL WAR. Character arcs are fully developed and engrossing. The script is intricately and brilliantly written making us not only think, but entertain us at the same time. Much of that entertainment factor, beyond the characters themselves, comes by way of action; and not just action sequences for the sake of action and set pieces. The action in CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR is much like the song and dance sequences in MGM musicals during the Arthur Freed years. It is a component part of the script and the story, flowing with the dialogue and story for a completely cohesive and synergistic meld of story and action. And yes, while there is the much ballyhooed “airport sequence” that brings Spider-Man, Ant-Man and Black Panther into the fold, with CIVIL WAR the Russos bring us more intimate and inventive fight choreography and sequencing that not only mirrors the emotional and moral battles between brothers and sisters, but which is also executed in closer quarters, metaphorically intensifying how personal the fight has now become for each. CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR begins with a 1991 flashback to James “Bucky” Buchanan as he is released from his cryogenic state by Soviet soldiers and programmed for duty as the Winter Soldier. We witness the pain of the psychologic transformation and gain better understanding of who this man/killing machine is. We see the man. We feel his pain. And then we see the twisted result of “science.” Fast forward to the present and we meet up with Steve Rogers/Captain America, Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow, Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch and Sam Wilson/Falcon as they attempt to capture Brock Rumlow/Crossbones, rumored to have survived his last encounter with the Avengers and now involved in some of sort of terrorism in the country of Lagos. Although successful in their intended mission, things go more than awry with explosions, destruction and mass civilian casualties. Called back to Washington for a meeting with Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross, and an unusually quiet Tony Stark, the team – including Lt. James Rhodes/War Machine and Vision – is being strong-armed to agree to the Sokovia Accords which would place the Avengers under the jurisdiction of the United Nations. 147 countries have signed the Accords, believing that the Avengers need to be put in check after what happened in Sokovia, New York and Washington, D.C. And Tony Stark, already facing his own crisis of conscience having lost Pepper Potts thanks to his obsessive and difficult nature as a boyfriend, has been pushed into agreeing with the Accords once racked with guilt after a confrontation with the mother of a young man killed in Sokovia. Not surprisingly, Rhodes is backing Stark. Also in agreement is Vision. Natasha and Wanda understand the reason behind the Accords and will agree to them but are not jumping for joy. The holdout is Steve Rogers. He looks beyond the immediate rush to judgment and sees the totality of the circumstances, the “what if” factor. What if there is a threat that must be immediately addressed but the Avengers can’t act without a UN resolution? What if they need to jump into action but for political reasons, they are precluded from so doing? No. Steve Rogers will not sign the Accords. Rogers becomes even more resolute in his position when the meeting of the UN world leaders in Vienna to celebrate and sign the Accords is attacked, leaving hundreds dead and even more injured, with all fingers pointing at Bucky Barnes/Winter Soldier as the masked man who detonated the building, something Rogers refuses to believe. He knows Bucky. He knows the humanity is still within him. He knows Bucky isn’t responsible for this heinous attack. So while there is an all points bulletin to capture and kill Bucky, Rogers determines to find his friend and save him. Making him even more determined is the death of Peggy Carter and some words of wisdom in a eulogy delivered at Peggy’s funeral by her niece, Sharon Carter; the same Sharon who was watching over Rogers while undercover for SHIELD. And standing by Rogers’ side is Sam Wilson. But it’s going to take more than Captain America and Falcon to save Bucky, especially once the pieces start coming together and a new villain is in the mix, Zemo; a villain who knows the best way to bring down an empire is from within. With battle lines drawn, the teams start amassing – Team Iron Man and Team Cap. Joining Iron Man is War Machine, Black Widow, Vision and newcomer, Black Panther aka T’Challa the King of Wakanda who is seeking revenge against Bucky for killing his father in the Vienna explosion. Of course, always on the lookout for new talent, Tony Stark discovers a young man slinging webs and swinging across rooftops and elicits his help. That young web-slinger is Spider-Man. All now deemed criminals for violating the Accords, Team Cap is led by Captain America with Bucky Buchanan, Falcon, Scarlet Witch and Hawkeye (who comes out of retirement and doing activities with his kids to stand by Scarlet Witch and Cap) by his side. And thanks to Falcon, who’s got a guy who knows a guy, Ant-Man joins in the fracas. And while Team Cap and Team Iron Man are facing off, Zemo is putting the final touches on his plan for the ultimate destruction of the Avengers. There’s no denying Robert Downey, Jr., Don Cheadle, Chris Evans, Anthony Mackie, Jeremy Renner and Scarlett Johansson know their characters inside out. Interesting is watching the growth of each character and the subtleties each actor brings to play. Notable is Johansson’s performance as she imbues an ambiguity within Natasha that is so authentic, we see conflict on her face and in hesitant tentative movements. Mackie easily picks up the mantle of having some of the lighter dialogue which we might normally expect from Downey. Mackie brings more of a humorous touch as opposed to biting sarcasm which works extremely well within the story construct here. However, Downey gives one of his finest dramatic scenes in the franchise thanks to a revelation that will blow your mind. This go-round we get to discover more about Bucky and as a result, we see more of Sebastian Stan and what he brings to the table. Stan has a brooding questioning intensity that is riveting as we, like Cap, must always wonder “which Bucky are we seeing”. Stan does a delicate dance vacillating between his personalities. Similarly, Elizabeth Olsen demonstrates what a fine dramatic actress she is becoming as Wanda constantly questions herself. Olsen plays the inquisitive self-examination beautifully, particularly opposite Paul Bettany’s Vision as we wonder just what’s up with those two. Bettany also adds a questioning pragmatism to Vision, who is still learning the ropes as a new “being”. As Black Panther, Chadwick Boseman makes a more than impressive entrance into the MCU and without giving any spoilers, creates more than enough interest and excitement for what’s to come for Black Panther. Although we’ve already seen and love Paul Rudd as Ant-Man, it doesn’t take away from the joy of seeing his comedic antics and timing of dialogue delivery as he mixes it up with the Avengers, tossing in tongue-in-cheek one-liners that are especially effective when expressing his childlike glee at meeting each and every one of them. And speaking of childlike glee, look no further than the first perfectly cast Spider-Man with Tom Holland. Scene-stealing, wide-eyed, eager, Holland is everything you hope to see in a young super hero testing the waters with his super hero gimmick. Watching Holland and Downey at their initial meeting is hilarious as you see the 17-year old Downey come out in full force as he taunts Holland and the two go back and forth like on a playground. As with Rudd’s Ant-Man, the Russos and scribes Markus and McFeely, also infuse Spider-Man with his own giddy glee at meeting the Avengers. Again, a very human touch. Nice to see Emily VanCamp’s Sharon Carter expanded here and to see VanCamp embrace the performance with a freedom that is welcoming, but also with nuance similar to that of Johansson. Daniel Bruhl is perfection as Zemo. With a baby face and performance texture that speaks anything but “villain”, it falls to subtlety and dialogue delivery to inform the character, a talent which Bruhl turns on and off with ease. He fascinates. And be on the lookout for a very fun trip down memory lane as Maria Tomei reteams with her 1994 “Only You” co-star Robert Downey Jr. as Spider-Man’s Aunt Mae meets Tony Stark. The action is unparalleled not only in its incorporation as part of the “scripted dialogue”, but in its execution. Switching up lensing styles from intimate handheld to crane, dolly, widescreen, we are immersed in each moment while feeling the stakes of each battle thanks to the meld of story and action. As described to me by Joe Russo, “[A]ction is very important to us. These movies are about action. The characters express themselves through action. Action has to have storytelling to enforce it. . .You’ll get tired of an action sequence if it’s not either defining a character or moving the story forward in some way and it takes an incredible amount of effort.” Crediting Kevin Feige and the writers “who can work with us and keep us honest in terms of the storytelling” as well as the cast “who are also the caretakers of the characters in a way that we never could do”, melding story and action is “by far and away the hardest thing to do on a film.” Reflecting on the filmmaking process, Russo notes, “The easiest thing to do on a film is when you have a Soderbergh level cast like this to put down the dramatic scenes on camera, especially with actors of this caliber who have been playing these parts for this long. Those are some of the easiest things we do. So the hardest thing we do is executing the action.” And as comes as no surprise, for Russo, the toughest sequence in the film was the airport sequence. “It’s filled with a lot of moving parts, a lot of different characters. You want to move each character forward, you want to make sure you’re not leaving anybody behind. I think we went well into the post process, still reshaping and rethinking and reconfiguring that sequence to make sure that it had its maximum storytelling thrust to it.” There is a conviction of purpose that infuses every aspect of CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR. Be it within the characters or the script or the lensing, confidence in purpose abounds at every turn. As sure as Tony Stark is in his beliefs and as certain as Steve Rogers is in his, there is never a wavering in the investment of showing both sides of the coin and the overall package. The bar has been set. The battles lines drawn. Be it Team Cap or Team Iron Man, CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR is better than “Star Wars: The Force Awakens”, the best of the MCU, and dare I say it, the best movie of the year."
"Oct 27, 2019",positive," Not only does the film juggle a dozen major superheroes pretty seamlessly, but it somehow manages to tell a cohesive story while not making the film feel too stuffed or overcomplicated. After a NYC screening of ""Civil War"" ended Monday evening, the man on my right declared that this was the movie ""BvS"" director Zack Snyder thought he made. Now, that's not easy for me to say. I love Batman. And while I did not detest Warner Bros.’ big budget ""Batman v Superman"" movie as much as most critics, I couldn’t shake the feeling that ""Civil War"" was the movie Warner Bros. wanted to make.  The superheroes deal with the fallout of their previous big action flick (""Man of Steel""/""Avengers: Age of Ultron""). After one more mishap, the government gets involved to enforce superhero regulation. As a result, the superheroes are pit against each other for the entire movie only to learn in the third act that a madman mastermind orchestrated everything with the intention of the heroes tearing each other apart. ""Batman v Superman"" was about playing catch up to Marvel’s big Cinematic Universe. In doing so, a lot was thrown into the film. Some things worked, like Ben Affleck’s Batman. Many others — Doomsday, the insertion of extraneous superheroes for future films, and that random bathtub scene with a nude Lois Lane — didn't. ""Civil War"" did everything ""BvS"" tried to do in a big superhero film pretty effortlessly, and while catering to a larger rotating cast of characters. When you put a group of beloved superheroes on a large stage together, you shouldn’t just have them fighting each other for the sake of fighting. As a viewer, you want to see characters who don’t know each other meet for the first time. What would it be like if Spider-Man met Iron Man? How would Ant-Man get along with Hawkeye? ""Civil War"" answers those questions and more. Where ""BvS"" failed to deliver fun, witty dialogue between its trinity of heroes in costume, ""Civil War"" succeeds ten-fold. Paul Rudd’s Ant-Man fanboys over meeting Captain America (Chris Evans), Ant-Man messes with Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), and Spider-Man (Tom Holland) comments on the logic of Captain’s shield. Falcon and Bucky Barnes/The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) also have a fun love-hate relationship. At one point, the two are seated in a hilariously tiny Beetle. They look hilarious in it. When Bucky asks Falcon if he can move his seat up, without looking at him, Falcon adamantly says no. That received the biggest laugh at my screening. ""Civil War"" is about more than just superheroes going to battle and it’s not all fun and games. It becomes a question of whether superheroes should be granted unlimited freedom to act without government supervision. When Captain America’s former best friend Bucky is wanted for a crime he didn’t commit, he sides with him against a majority of the Avengers. The question for him becomes how far do you go for a friend? What are you willing to risk for something that you believe in — your freedom? Your reputation? The Avengers really don’t want to go to battle because the people on each of the two sides see each other as an extended family of sorts. They care about each other, whether they’ll admit it or not. That’s evident when Steve Rogers asks Tony Stark about his uncertain relationship with Pepper Potts and when Black Widow and Hawkeye are facing off. The two friends don't try to kill one another. They don’t even give it their all, and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) calls Hawkeye out on that. Where the film really pays off is with its big action sequences. Though we’ve seen a majority of them teased in trailers and television spots, they are some of the best of any Marvel movie. Pretty much every review talks about the big airport scene teased in the film’s trailers. That was hands-down the most satisfying scene of any Marvel movie I’ve ever watched. Others have said this, but I would watch that scene on loop several times over and it would still not be enough. I’m not even going to say anything more about it because it should just be experienced in theaters. And that’s not the only large fight sequence to get excited about. There are multiple superhero team ups and takedowns throughout the film for fans to enjoy, including a showdown between Iron Man, Captain America, and The Winter Soldier. Chadwick Boseman’s Black Panther is a commanding presence any time he's on screen as the prince of the fictional African nation of Wakanda. He’ll be getting his own standalone movie in 2018. And once again, Vision (Paul Bettany) is a wonderful comedic relief. For whatever reason, his AI wears a few sweaters in the film. Whoever thought to put clothes on the AI, bravo. It’s so distractingly delightful. The overall scene stealer is Tom Holland’s Spider-Man. The film wastes no time trying to tell the webslinger’s backstory, he’s just inserted into the fray, and it works. After five Spider-Man films since 2002, if you don’t know his origin story by now (bitten by a radioactive spider, gets spider-like abilities) then you’ve probably been living under a rock. But unlike the previous men in the role (Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield), Peter Parker — who’s a teen when he gets his powers in the comics — is finally being played by, you guessed it, a teen. And he refreshingly acts like a young kid with superpowers would. Unlike the other heroes, he’s overly chatty in fight sequences. His rapport with Downey Jr.’s Tony Stark on screen is the kicker: Stark refers to him as Spider-ling and Spider-Boy while inquiring about his hot Aunt May (Marisa Tomei). I would watch an entire movie with those two together. (Good news. We’ll get to see them together again in a new Spider-Man.) A close second is Robert Downey Jr. If this wasn't a Captain America movie, it could easily be an Iron Man movie with Stark's snarky quips and one liners. However, beneath the billionaire's haughty ego, ""Civil War"" reveals a vulnerable layer of emotional depth to Stark's character you probably weren't expecting to receive in a big ensemble picture. ""Civil War"" isn’t the best superhero movie ever or Marvel’s best movie yet, as many critics have said. It’s up there, but I think Joss Whedon’s ""The Avengers"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" are better. The film starts off a bit slow, wading us through the UN’s plan to get all of the ""enhanced"" humans to sign some paperwork approved by 117 countries to relinquish their rights as free Avengers. Up until the hour mark you’re watching Tony Stark chase down Steve Rogers, trying to convince him to sign said papers. Thrilling stuff. If you’ve watched the trailers, you’re just waiting around to see the heroes join sides with Captain America or Iron Man. Once you get past the one hour mark, it’s all action-packed smooth sailing. One of the other complaints I have about the film is the main villain. While the character himself is a longstanding Avengers comic villain, in the film, he doesn’t appear to be much more than a mere mortal. If you’re a casual viewer, you may leave the film going, ""That guy was able to pull one over on the Avengers?"" If a superpowerless man is able to turn the Avengers against themselves, I fear what an alien like Thanos (who has been hinted since 2012’s ""The Avengers"") can do to the team. It’s not looking so good.  The film itself has too much location jumping as well. There are over half a dozen location changes across the film which seems a bit unnecessary. It’s not a subtle transition either thanks to the giant lettering that crowds the screen any time the film swaps venues. It was rather distracting and took you out of the film for a few seconds every time. ""Civil War"" may not be a perfect film, but it’s a grand illustration of what makes Marvel’s superhero movies so successful — they’re fun, relatable, and easily accessible for general audiences who have never picked up a comic book. As the other studios try to play catch-up with Marvel’s cinematic universe on the big screen, they should take note."
"Oct 21, 2019",positive,"It's hard to get all the characters involved without making it confusing, but Directors [Anthony] Russo and [Joe] Russo did their homework and a pretty good job."
"Oct 21, 2019",positive," Captain America Civil War opens too wide release this weekend. Have we finally reached superhero saturation or will civil War directors the Russo Brothers keep audiences Crazy and clamoring for more? Cinema Siren has the answer for you! Let me start with not so much a warning, as a tease. CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR is not really a Captain America movie, It’s an Avengers movie standing behind a starred shield. While Cap is the central figure, he is so only by small margin. It’s a story comic book fans know and love, and its interpretation for the screen has been much anticipated. As the name implies, the central storyline of CIVIL WAR, is that our favorite costumed characters, once friends, are now at odds. Being asked to allow oversight by the powers-that-be, has lead to a rift. Captain America leads one side, and Iron Man leads the other. They enlist a whopping 10 other superheroes to their teams. Colossal clashes ensue. There are battles. Who is on what team and why? Does the idea of two major comic book creations tussling while politicians cry for more control sound somewhat familiar? Indeed, in that way, Captain America: Civil War shares more than just a passing similarity to Batman v Superman. So what? Any comic book fan knows there are many shared themes and stories. With that in mind, why can’t Marvel and DC coexist, and even, dare I say, intermingle in the hearts of fans? That being said, Captain America: Civil War benefits greatly and keeps their audiences in thrall leveraging the basic Marvel trait shared by most of its characters: a snarky sense of humor. Or perhaps we should say, a stark-y one. There is no shortage of darkness, death, and destruction in this film, but comedic touches offer welcome shifts in mood. In that, directors Anthony and Joe Russo create a nearly perfect balance. Kudos, also, to the screenwriters who somehow divvy up just the right amount of screen time to heroes we know, such as Cap, Iron Man, and Black Widow, those we want to know better, like War Machine, Vision, Scarlet Witch, and Ant-Man, and those we meet for the first time. With cheers often erupting when onscreen, Black Panther, as played by Chadwick Boseman and Spider-Man, ably embodied by Tom Holland nearly steal the entire film, and both beg for their own features. There are some strong, surprising character arcs, especially for Steve Rogers, which is as it should be. Chris Evans has made the character so his own it’s hard to imagine any other actor donning his shield. Downey Jr. himself is quite a standout in the film. We learn a great deal about Stark’s backstory and the personal demons that plague him, and as usual the actor is up to the challenge. With this many characters and aspects to story, it’s possibly inevitable that things get a bit unnecessarily convoluted, especially with regards to the villain’s and even several of the heroes’ motivations. These are forgivable trifles in the face of such entertainment and spectacle. CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR has thrown down the gauntlet for any other would-be blockbuster released in 2016. I pity any film, regardless of genre, opening in the next four weeks. It would be easy to nitpick about confusing plot lines and an over abundance of characters. That would mean unfairly discrediting the colossal job of successfully integrating so many superheroes while maintaining distinct personalities and points of view. Ultimately Captain America Civil War is fun & exciting, and will make even more fans, if that’s even possible, for the Avengers franchise."

"Aug 29, 2019",positive," The Russo brothers Joe and Anthony did such a killer job on Winter Soldier that Marvel not only gave them Civil War, but also gave them the nod for the next Avengers: Infinity War - Part 1 & 2. In the vein of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice but a master-class smack-down on how to do it properly, Captain America: Civil War pits superhero against superhero upping the ante ten-fold by making it plural and making it the Avengers. More super-power, more fire-power, but most importantly, more brain-power makes this not just a far superior superhero move, but a far superior movie full stop. So, simply put and spoiler-free, here we have Captain America on a mission to do the right thing by his old mate Bucky, except this time, not everyone agrees. Well mostly Iron Man doesn’t agree, and Tony Stark is used to getting his own way. While I know you’re one click away from knowing each and everyone of them, what they do, who plays them, when they’re next in their own movie and what their favourite colour is, let me remind you how much more fun movies are the less you know about them. As usual with the Russo Brothers, the fight and action scenes both intimate hand-to-hand and all-in ground and air brawls are outstanding, in IMAX 3D especially they are stunningly immersive and glorious to watch. But tying all the action together is a tight, cohesive, superbly told story, infused with comedy and heart, a story which allowed each of the characters to play their part without ever overshadowing the ensemble.  Two viewings in, there is plenty of time for Civil War to take on Winter Soldier as my favourite Marvel ever -- it’s already a close contest."
"Jul 9, 2019",positive," At the end of the first Iron Man, when Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) popped up to mention “The Avengers Initiative,” it launched what can only be described as the most massive collective nerdgasm in this or any quantum parallel reality. Since then, there have been minor nerdquake aftershocks (seeing the team together for the first time, hearing Captain America [Chris Evans] first bark out orders, the insane side-scrolling action shot in Age of Ultron). But twice during Captain America: Civil War, I thought the audience was going to have the first recorded joyous nerdshart. We’ll get to them, just wait for it. Unlike Batman v. Superman: I Told You That Was Going to Suck, which was allegedly a sequel to Man of Steel but was really two hours of hilariously overwrought dude brooding, Civil War is honestly a sequel to Captain America: Winter Soldier. Hell, it harkens all the way back to the first solo Captain America movie in a meaningful way. Cap is looking for The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), who everyone sees as a terrorist menace who needs to be put down, except Cap, who wants his friend back. This leads into a bigger divide when government agents decide that superheroes need more supervision. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr) agrees, admitting that even he deserved oversight that would have possibly prevented the deaths of thousands when he accidentally invented Ultron. When The Winter Soldier, under brainwashed duress, is involved in another act of mass terror, the battle lines get drawn explicitly. Team Cap boasts Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), The Winter Soldier, Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and the Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). Team Iron Man is War Machine (Don Cheadle), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Vision (Paul Bettany) and, most nerdshartly, Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spider-man (Tom Holland). Then everybody fights and, for anyone who has ever before loved a comic book, we see the face of God. To say that Boseman and Holland “reinvigorated” the franchise is a horrifyingly irresponsible understatement. The Rock was once called “franchise Viagra,” injected as an actor into sequels to give some more pep. Boseman and Holland are like giving Viagra some Viagra. From squee-inducing moments like watching Spidey web up Captain America to hilarious asides like Iron Man macking on Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) to the Black Panther shrugging off .50 caliber bullets fired from a helicopter and being treated as, inarguably, the most important supporting character in terms of plot and consequence, everything works. Everything. This is the true culmination of the grand Marvel experiment. It’s not over, as the ending still leaves wounds and unanswered questions. But two major missing elements (Spider-man and a superpowered person of color) helped finished the mythical mosaic they’ve been slowly, artfully and playfully crafting for a decade. It’s perfectly acceptable to not like Captain America: Civil War. It simply means you care not for this particular genre, because in any way I can think to analyze, it represents its zenith."
"May 10, 2019",positive,The action and the introduction of some pivotal new characters are enough to satisfy most expectations.
"May 6, 2019",positive," While in LA last month, I got to be one of the first people to see Captain America: Civil War – almost a month before it hit theaters (which is today!). To say I was blown away is an understatement. Most of you know how big of a Marvel fan I am, so I have been looking forward to this film for a long time. I knew going in that it most likely would vary from the comic books, which is a good thing because I like to be surprised (and Joe Russo, one of the Directors, agrees with me), but I was surprised by just how much. It was like watching a whole new story and I loved the way they did it. Captain America: Civil War is full of action, drama, and even some romance. I always promise no spoilers so I won’t give anything away but I will say that this is my favorite Marvel movie yet. Yes, it even trumps Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 as my all-time favorite. The tension between Captain America and Iron Man is done perfectly. It is a story about politics and each of them is doing what they truly feel deep down is the right thing to do. In the comic books, I am one thousand percent #TeamIronMan, but with the movie version, I honestly cannot choose. They both make some very valid points and I just don’t know which way is the best answer. I love every character in this film but the addition of Tom Holland as Spider-Man was brilliant. He is incredible as Peter Parker! He has the humor, the youth, and the excitement. I loved watching him on the big screen as one of the most iconic superheroes out there. Some of you guys have asked me if Stan Lee makes another cameo in this film, I won’t say anything, but has he ever missed a Marvel movie before? The battle scenes in this film are amazing but I will be honest, it is strange to watch some of my favorite heroes fighting each other and not a common villain. Even though I knew this was coming, it was intense to watch. The airport scene is probably my favorite of the whole movie. This is one REALLY cool thing that happens that I cannot talk about because I don’t want to ruin it for you guys – but watch Ant-Man closely. I may have shed a tear or two during the movie as well. It is truly full of emotion – there is a huge reveal at the end that had me sad and mad for one of my favorite characters. You really do not want to miss this movie! As with all Marvel movies, there are some post-credit scenes. I got to see one – and there is a second one as well! So I plan to go see Captain America: Civil War for a second time this weekend for many reasons, but one is to see that second scene! To help celebrate the release of Captain America: Civil War, DisneyStore.com has lots of personalization items. I could have spent hours looking through them all – but I finally settled on a Black Widow shirt and a Scarlet Witch shirt with my daughters’ names on the back. Those are two pretty strong and pretty amazing women from the film, and I want my girls to have great role models. The process was easy, I could have put their names anywhere on the shirts (and I could change color and size of the lettering as well as color of the shirt too!) and decided to put them on the back. We are eagerly awaiting them and I cannot wait for my daughters to represent the women of Civil War and show off their awesome shirts thanks to Disney Store! Check out the personalization shop here! Marvel’s “Captain America: Civil War” finds Steve Rogers leading the newly formed team of Avengers in their continued efforts to safeguard humanity. But after another incident involving the Avengers results in collateral damage, political pressure mounts to install a system of accountability, headed by a governing body to oversee and direct the team. The new status quo fractures the Avengers, resulting in two camps—one led by Steve Rogers and his desire for the Avengers to remain free to defend humanity without government interference, and the other following Tony Stark’s surprising decision to support government oversight and accountability.

"Apr 3, 2019",positive," Civil War assembles the Avengers for an all-out all-star battle. With newcomers Black Panther and Spider-Man offering show-stealing highlights, appetites are left whetted for the future, rather than teased for the upcoming meal. The film pulls many emotional punches, holding back for the sake of those same upcoming films, and the intellectual battle is increasingly shaky, with Captain America at his least heroic yet. The pace can’t keep its gallop and the fights can’t keep their wallop, but as a convergence and dispersion of all which has come before Civil War is a resounding victory. Civil War is A-grade filmmaking, as confident as it is competent, and a shiny stone in Marvel’s gauntlet. The series’ future is safe in the Russo brothers’ hands. Moonlighting as a reviewer and editor, I'm more at home with recent films than golden oldies and enjoy appreciating the technical achievements as much as the escapism of the movies. Happy to try any film once, if only for fifteen minutes.
I also volunteer with MediCinema - a charity which every film fan should look into if they don't already know about."
"Mar 11, 2019",positive," The buzz over the latest Marvel blockbuster has been through the roof. It’s already made over $200 mil internationally before it even opened here in the US, so no doubt it will wipe out any competition here this weekend. I have to say that despite my increasing superhero fatigue, I was still looking forward to this one mostly because I love the first two Captain America films, and I have faith in the Russo brothers’ direction. Like Zack Snyder with Batman V Superman, Anthony & Joe Russo had the tricky task of not only continuing the thread of the Avenger story, pulling off a large ensemble cast AND help launch/introduce individual standalone films (Black Panther, Spider-man). Suffice to say the Russos did a much, much better job than Snyder in delivering an entertaining Summer blockbuster that’s actually has depth and thought-provoking ideas. Interesting that The Avengers and Superman share a similar predicament in their effort to safeguard humanity, and how the DC and Marvel tentpole movies are dealing with the issue of accountability. The ‘Civil War’ in the title stems from an ideological conflict about what should be done in that issue of accountability and collateral damage, and whether a governing body (in this case the UN) should oversee them. Now, the fact that the perceived common enemy happens to be Steve Rogers’ (Chris Evans) BFF Bucky a.k.a. The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), it’s easy to see which side the Cap is on. The events in The Winter Soldier has undoubtedly made Cap wary of big government and how a centralized power could be manipulative and corrupt. So it makes sense that he won’t be so easily persuaded to sign something like The Sokovia Accords that’d essentially put the Avengers under UN control. Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow: Just because it’s the path of least resistance doesn’t mean it’s the wrong path. Staying together is more important than how we stay together. …
Whilst the motive behind Captain firmly believing in self-regulation is more clear cut, I’m not as convinced why Tony Stark would support it with little resistance. A cameo by Alfre Woodard briefly reveals the burden of guilt on Tony’s part as the Stark companies supplies most of the weaponry (including Captain himself who was created in the lab of his dad Howard), but still I’d think he’d be more apprehensive about government interference in the Avengers. I have to say that the film has a pretty slow start. I understand they’d have to establish the conflict and a reason for all the fighting, but it went on a bit too long for my liking and frankly, it all feels a bit tedious. Thankfully, things do pick up as soon as an incident happens at the UN meeting and before you know it, Captain becomes a hunted man wanted by the government along with Bucky. It’s there that we meet new Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)’s member Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and he certainly looks the part. This is perhaps one of the most diverse cast in a Marvel film aside from the X-Men franchise. I think the fact that the same writers, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, are involved in the Captain America trilogy so far makes the film flow nicely and has a cohesive storyline. They also did a decent job showing the events in previous films to viewers who might not be familiar with the Avengers story, i.e. the battle in the fictional Eastern European country Sokovia in Avenger: Age of Ultron that caused massive collateral damage. Marvel fans would especially enjoy the references and inside jokes, especially during the actual civil war battle involving a dozen MCU superheroes. This is also the first time we see the new Spider-man (Tom Holland) as part of MCU and he’s definitely a highlight. Spidey is supposed to be a wisecrackin’ teenager and Holland’s captured that. All his comments as he’s fighting the other heroes, like referencing Empire Strikes Back and saluting Cap before he fights him, are a hoot. The intro to the appropriately-aged character is full of good humor as he’s fanboying over Iron Man, who somehow still has time to flirt with aunt May (Marisa Tomei, Robert Downey Jr’s co-star in the rom-com Only You) despite a brief 36-hour deadline to arrest Cap. There’s a lot of fanboy-ing going on in this movie that’s so hilarious. My fave part is when Ant-Man (the immensely affable Paul Rudd) meets Cap which got one of the biggest laughs in the theater. Captain America: Civil War is commendable for having the right balance of story, character, emotion, humor AND high-octane action. The fight scenes are well-choreographed that you can actually see the action despite the sheer number of people fighting. It wasn’t so bombastic that it’s headache-inducing. The story never feels cartoonish even with SO many characters involved and the battles feel sprightly and fun without being frivolous or silly. When one character is injured, we feel the emotion of fellow team members and the sense of solidarity is definitely there. The Captain America trilogy benefits from the strong base of Steve/Bucky relationship established in the first film. I totally believe why Cap would go to such length to protect his best friend and stand by his side regardless of what he’s done, and I think Bucky would’ve done the same if the situation were reversed. I love Evans and Stan even more as they become more at ease in their respective roles, and Anthony Mackie is always so charming and fun as Falcon. I also have to mention how I appreciate Scarlett Johansson‘s Black Widow more and more, and the fact that she’s undeniably torn between the two sides is a testament to her intriguing character arc. The key in making a huge ensemble cast work is they have to have a reason for us to care for the characters. It’s getting immensely tricky here but I think keeping the focus on just a small group helps. The final battle between Cap, Iron Man & Winter Soldier is not only cool to watch but it also carries a certain emotional weight because there’s something personal that affects the three of them. It’s perhaps one of the most compelling dramatic moments from RDJ that I’ve seen in all the Iron Man & Avengers movies so far. That said, I don’t think this film is perfect and I don’t think it’s the greatest MCU film so far, as many critics have said. I’ve mentioned about the rather sluggish start, but there are also moments that don’t really work. Daniel Brühl is a perfectly capable actor but he barely makes a dent here amongst an ocean of characters, though I think the character’s motive is a pretty decent one. The romance between Cap and Sharon Carter also feels so obligatory and the lack of chemistry between Evans and Emily VanCamp doesn’t help. Oh how I miss Hayley Atwell‘s Agent Carter who’s such a strong female character who doesn’t need any superpowers to make a difference. I also find the music unmemorable as I barely remember any of it, which is odd given I LOVE what Henry Jackman did with The Winter Soldier. All in all, it’s a VERY good film that ties all three Captain American movies superbly well and would rank amongst the best film trilogies. After this, I’m even more confident in the Russo brothers’ directing talent and MCU is definitely in capable hands if they continue to make Marvel movies. I love the end credits of the first two Captain America movies and they did an excellent job here as well. In terms of replay-ability value, this one ranks third after The Winter Soldier and The First Avenger, both of which I actually just re-watched last night and I still enjoyed them immensely! I saw the film earlier today as I scored the last ticket for the morning show and I had fun as did the audience I watched it with.  Ant-Man, Black Panther, and Spider-Man.  They were a blast.  I think they hit paydirt with Boseman as Black Panther as he really became the character and I’m glad he’s going to get his own film.  Tom Holland for me now, is the best Peter Parker/Spider-Man.  He gets it right.  He is very funny but also kinda nerdy and he’s so impossible to dislike. There’s a lot of other things in the film I like such as Natasha being torn as it is obvious how close she is with Steve and was there for him during that moment where he is filled with loss.  I also enjoyed Elizabeth Olsen’s performance as Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch as someone who is trying to find her footing but also has some guilt where that little she has with Rogers I thought was a nice touch where I think Steve sees her as a little sister of sorts and can comfort her.  It was a lot better than I thought it would be while I also found myself laughing a lot.  Including the moments between Falcon and Bucky as I could watch those 2 banter at each other.  Here’s my review BTW. Hi Steven! I’ll check out your review latre today. Yes I think Boseman and Holland were great additions to MCU, I love how regal Boseman was and how nerdy Holland was, which was appropriate for the character. Yes I really like Natasha being torn, I think that her scene w/ Bucky, Cap & Black Panther was one of the highlights of the film as well. I really love the trio of Bucky, Cap and Falcon! Saw it last night and loved it! I didn’t mind the slow build up in the first half, reminded me of the older Bond films, in fact this one feels even more like a espionage film with all those different locations. I’m going to see it again next week at the IMAX theater, so far it’s a toss up between this one and The Winter Soldier as the best film in the Marvel universe. I’m surprised that not too many people mention Black Panther as one of the highlights, seems like Spider-Man and Ant-Man are getting more love but to me Black Panther got my attention and looking forward to his solo film. I love the climatic battle between the three characters too, I thought for sure they’ll team up and fight those other winter soldiers and a super villain will show up. Glad they didn’t pull a Batman vs. Superman trick and kept the focus on the conflicts between Iron Man and Capt. Hi Ted, I thought you had seen it at IMAX already. I don’t know yet if I’d have time to see it again. I still think The Winter Soldier has more of the suspense of an espionage film and frankly I’m not crazy about the way they introduced the different locations in CW w/ those huge fonts, it’s like they’re screaming at you or something. I like both Black Panther and Spider-Man, though the latter is a lot more fun to watch I guess because he’s inherently funny. Yes I think keeping the focus on just Iron Man & Capt (w/ Bucky in the middle) is wise, because ultimately it’s THEIR battle, the rest are their allies. No, I saw it at the Icon Atmos theater Friday night, mostly because of the reserved VIP seats. You can reserve seats at the IMAX theater now but I know it’s going to be packed and didn’t want to sit next to a lot of people. I usually go to a matinee showing at the IMAX theater because it’s not that busy during the day. Nice! I know you’re not into superhero movies Jordan, but the Captain America films are so good and even the second film felt more like espionage films than a straight superhero movie. Oh you have seen that one? Glad to hear it Jordan! This one is by the same duo directors and has a similar espionage feel to it, but it does have a boatload more superheroes. That’s why I still prefer Winter Soldier to this third one. Hmmm, its raining like all hell, massive winds…. and the cinema around the corner is of course playing it. I might go see it just to get away from the wind rattling everything in my house!! And cos it is by the same directors, that is what has me interested. So often franchises are directed by a different guy each time around. Oh man that sounds nasty! I remember those torrential rains back when I still live in Jakarta. Hey, watching ‘Civil War’ sounds like a perfect way to escape from nasty weather. Yes I think it’s always a good idea to have the same director direct an entire franchise, that’s why the Nolan Dark Knight trilogy is so good. That said, I did like the first Captain America film and its decidedly retro look and feel. I haven’t seen the first one, only Winter Soldier and the first Avengers movie (which I didn’t like at all), so I don’t think I’ll get lost. And I must admit that there were parts of Winter Soldier that I liked a lot. What I really hate though is the almost obligatory city being smashed to bits using CGI in the final act. Even Deadpool had that. Ahah, special powers! Too funny. Well I only suggest this one to you as you like Winter Soldier. I’d think you’d be curious what happens to well, the Winter Soldier himself aka Bucky. I like the first Captain America and no city was blown to bits in that one 😉 I agree it’s irritating when they do that, I know you’d absolutely hate Man of Steel and Dawn of Justice because the destruction is even more atrocious.  Hey Ruth, great review as always – I agree with a lot of what you say about Civil War.  I’d rate it as one of the best of the Marvel films, it does get off to a slowish start but I’m just glad in the end a decent balance between story, character and action was achieved. Black Panther was certainly a highlight as was Spidey (although I did miss Andrew Garfield a little but Tom Holland did a great job) and I had the same thoughts about Henry Jackman’s score. Like you I loved the Winter Soldier soundtrack but there weren’t any standout musical elements in CW. He..he.. nice to see your name commenting on my Captain America review, for obvious reasons 😉 This one is definitely one of the best MCU films but I still think The Winter Soldier as my fave. I just rewatched the first two this weekend actually. I don’t miss the previous Spidey actors, though by no means am I clamoring to see the new Spidey movies. I do think Holland fits the role of a teenage Peter Parker very well, funny they went w/ another Brit again for the role. This one’s going to be interesting to watch once the BluRay comes along and people get to really pull the film apart: I think the film plays better to a large cinema audience than it does at home alone, with Peter Parker’s introduction scene coming out of nowhere and bringing the film to a complete halt. That said, I did enjoy this one A LOT and can’t wait to delve deeper into it. I thought the Russo’s did an amazing job considering all the balls they had in the air with this project (I don’t envy their task ahead in Infinity War, that’s for sure) and the film balanced comic-geek action with subtle character direction, something sadly lacking from the bombast of Batman V Superman (A film I *did* enjoy despite it’s flaws).  Best bit for me? The moment of comprehension between Panther and **** on the ice tundra toward the end of the film, where T’Challa comes to understand that his revenge would only ever be a hollow victory. A great, quiet, wonderful character beat between two characters both diametrically opposed and uniquely similar, and it summed up the entire film in a single scene, for me. Hi Rodney! Interesting perspective about Spidey intro. I don’t think it brought the film to a halt, though there was a slight pause in the film as the entire cast was looking at him. But I think he’s a fun addition to the Avengers. Yes very true the Russos had so much juggling act to do w/ this one and Infinity War, I hope it’ll be eons better than Age of Ultron. Ah yes, that scene w/ Black Panther & Bruhl’s character is a good one. The quiet moment still had as much power as the bombastic one, and that’s a testament to the great acting and direction. I don’t have superhero fatigue but am getting pretty close to Marvel fatigue. Until Civil War, which was a blast almost from start to finish. I think I preferred the Winter Soldier but not by much. I agree with you that Iron Man’s motivations were a little unclear and, from everything I know about the characters, I feel like Iron Man should have been fighting against the Accord and Captain America should have been towing the company line. I actually have more of a DC fatigue than Marvel because Dawn of Justice made me even less interested in seeing all those individual movies like The Flash, Aquaman, etc. The only one I’m still excited about is Wonder Woman, for obvious reasons. Yeah, I thought the reverse POV of the two characters might throw off some people, but I think w/ Cap, the events in Winter Soldier w/ Hydra infiltrating SHIELD made him distrustful of big government, so it makes sense. Oh, I still have hope for DC. Batman and Superman have been well-cast and I’m hoping the Flash and Aquaman stand-alone films will be good since Zach Snyder won’t be making them. Great review! I loved this film so much, I’m glad you pointed out the lack of chemistry between VanCamp and Evans because that entire relationship was the low point for me. Bruhl was underused, but I didn’t mind because the conflict wasn’t really about him. He was just the puppeteer, and I would’ve be surprised if he returned for Infinity Wars. Hi Brittani! Glad to hear you love this too. I never liked VanCamp even from Winter Soldier. I think the fact that Peggy had just died made it weird that Cap was kissing her so soon. I think Bruhl’s bound to be underused considering there are just WAY too many characters already, but I think he still did a good job. I LOVE the Cap movies! It’s my second fave superhero trilogy now after Nolan’s Dark Knight. I never would’ve predicted that given that initially I wasn’t even excited for a Captain America movie! I really enjoyed this one. I don’t want to say it’s the best MCU movie because I just saw it, but I am having a hard time thinking of a better one. For my money there are only 3 other contenders for that crown: The Avengers, The Winter Soldier, and Guardians of the Galaxy. I think our divergence on this can be traced to the start. I didn’t find it tedious at all, but I did on The Winter Soldier. Glad we agree that it is excellent, overall. I don’t know if it’s the best MCU though it’s right up there. I’m glad you love Winter Soldier too, Dell, that’ll be in my top 3 Marvel movies for sure! Oh really? That’s too bad. I LOVE the Captain America movies, even though initially I didn’t even care for the character as I don’t read the comics. But the trilogy is now my favorite. Give it a shot, who knows you might end up liking it too! So you’re saying you haven’t even seen The First Avenger? I actually re-watched the first two movies after I saw ‘Civil War’ and still love both of them. The Winter Soldier still tops it for me though, but only by a small margin. Nah, I’ve seen all the Avengers film, Age of Ultron…I’ve just missed a few here and there. Not sure if I’d get what was going on, because I was really confused in Age of Ultron.  I don’t like Ultron either, too much going on jumbled together. That’s why I like the Cap movies as the story is more focused, and I love the Cap/Bucky friendship that drives the conflict. Hello Zoë! Oh I still prefer the first two Cap movies to ‘Civil War,’ I think the fact that there are less characters in those made me like it more. I didn’t care for the last Avengers either, but the first one is ok, perhaps there’s that novelty factor as we’d just seen all of those Marvel superheroes in one movie for the first time. Oh will do! But even before reading it I’m totally ok if you rip it to shreds man, I’ll still be reading your blog 😉 Btw, I did review an indie movie last Friday that I think you would enjoy, in fact I can’t wait to rewatch it again!

"Mar 2, 2019",positive," Whose side are you on? = the phrase attached to the marketing campaign around Captain America: Civil War (which I’m going to alternately title “The Marvel Clash of the Titans“) is something I’ve been spending wayyyyy too long thinking about after having my entire face blown off by almost non-stop 3D action at the IMAX.  Most of Civil War is spent with those characters chasing each other in cars, kicking each other in the throat, and smashing each other into concrete. That 15% is good, though —  props to having a villain that uses brains instead of brute strength, or you know, mystical powers acquired from an alien object. And the way the division of the teams happens is pretty boss, too. That’s all I’m going to say about that plot, just because I think it’s a better film if you don’t know everything. I will say, though, that one of the best things about Civil War is that it introduces two more heroes in pretty great ways:  1) Black Panther, who, in my opinion, kind of stole the show, and 2) yet another reboot of Spider-Man, which I actually think they FINALLY got right. That F/X though. Fucking incredible! Like, it must have taken them forever to get all that stuff just right. That point is really hammered home after you sit through the approx. 1 million F/X artists listed in the credits to view the second post-credit sequence. So whose side am I on? #TeamCap or #TeamIronMan? Um, #TeamScarletWitch, OBVS, because she’s a fucking bad-ass. I was super stoked to see both her and Black Widow get as much screen time as they did and taking out at least as many bad guys as the boys. Speaking of — hey, Marvel, when are we gonna get standalone movies about Black Widow & Scarlet Witch, followed up by a WidowWitch Team sequel?"
"Feb 21, 2019",positive," In large part, what made Joe and Andrew Russo’s Captain America: The Winter Soldier such a successful and somewhat transcendent superhero movie was that its going concern wasn’t a global or even galactic catastrophe, but a personal one. The friendship between Brooklyn bros Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) and James Buchanan “Bucky” Barnes (Sebastian Stan) threatened to fall apart over the course of the film’s explosive events, though, in the end, their lifelong bond endured. “I’m with you to the end of the line,” Captain Rogers says to his brainwashed, killing-machine friend at the close of Winter Soldier in a chilling, melodramatic declaration of brotherly love. Their bond is once again the beating heart of the story in the Russos’ follow-up, Captain America: Civil War, and it’s the key ingredient that makes Marvel Studios’ latest offering their best yet. Unlike last year’s Avengers: Age of Ultron, Civil War is an ensemble superhero movie whose heroes don’t get lost in all the ass-kicking commotion. Sure, there’s more than enough ass-kicking to satisfy even the most rabid MCU fan (more on that later), but the impressive thing is that each character has an emotional arc that’s at once affecting and easy to keep track of. Take for example Elizabeth Olsen’s Scarlet Witch. In Age of Ultron, we learned that her parents were killed in a city-leveling act of war; at the outset of Civil War, we see her on the other side of that scenario as we watch her inadvertently kill innocents during an Avengers mission in Nigeria. The wicked irony of the situation leaves her in an awful state of mind, but she finds solace in the arms of her otherworldly android teammate Vision (Paul Bettany), who’s feeling romantic butterflies in his semi-synthetic belly for the first time. You’ll find simple, affecting side stories like this running throughout the movie, but the going concern is the moral divide between Steve Rogers and Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.). Following the destructive events in Nigeria, the governments of the world decide it’s time for the Avengers to answer to a higher power, stripping them of the liberty to choose when and where to act. Tony, tormented by guilt (the lives lost in Nigeria, New York and Sokovia as a result of the Avengers’ gigantic battles hang over his head like the sword of Damocles), is in favor of the proposal; Steve still feels the world is safest in the Avengers’ unshackled hands. Some of the heroes vote with Tony, like Vision, his best buddy, War Machine (Don Cheadle), and the painfully conflicted Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson). Falcon (Anthony Mackie) goes into hiding with his Captain, and they finally track down Bucky, the ever-elusive Winter Soldier, who’s deemed public enemy number one when he’s framed for recent deadly terrorist attacks. When Steve uncovers that the person responsible for the attacks is a man named Zemo (Daniel Bruhl), he gathers fresh recruits to help him stop the mad bomber, including Scarlet Witch, Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). Tony’s counter move is to recruit two new faces to the MCU: The Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and a bright, super-powered teenager from the Bronx named Peter Parker (Tom Holland). Yes, Spider-Man’s MCU debut is as amazing (no pun intended) as anyone could have hoped. The ensuing clash between team Stark and team Rogers (taking place in an evacuated Leipzig/Halle airport) is the most gloriously nerdy thing I’ve ever seen. It’s so fun I wanted to burst, with the Russos giving each of the heroes an incredibly cool moment or two to flex their powers in strange and inventive ways. What really puts things over the top is the dialogue, which showcases each character’s colorful personality in an economic, wildly entertaining way. Spider-Man is fascinated by Bucky’s metal arm (Holland is terrific), Ant-Man is still getting used to the abilities he gained in his solo movie (he even breaks out a new trick), and Black Widow and Hawkeye discuss how bizarre it is to be fighting each other as they pull their punches.  The airport showdown (shot in glorious IMAX) is hard to top, but the climactic one-on-one battle between Iron Man and Captain America (with poor Bucky caught in the middle) raises the stakes to new levels of tear-jerking high drama. The unexpected star of the show here is RDJ, who gives not just his best performance as Stark, but one of the best performances of his career. Civil War is as much his movie as it is Evans’, and the emotional rollercoaster he takes us on is unpredictable and utterly heartbreaking. Civil War is the best thing Marvel Studios has produced. Not only does it work well as the third act of the ballad of Steve and Bucky, but it sets up the future of the MCU brilliantly. I can’t wait to see how the odd mentor/pupil relationship between Tony and young Peter Parker develops in next year’s Spider-Man: Homecoming, and the romance between Scarlet Witch and Vision is so strange and delightful that it may be one of the main reason’s people will shell out even more dough when we arrive at Avengers: Infinity War (or whatever they’re calling it these days). Then there’s Black Panther, whose forthcoming solo movie will mark the first minority-led (and directed) entry for Marvel studios. Somehow, eight years in, the future of the ever-expanding MCU looks brighter than ever."
"Feb 12, 2019",negative," Marvel Studios sigue adelante con su Universo Cinematográfico y ahora nos presenta Capitán América: Civil War, una película que han dicho es buenísima, excelente, soberbia y magnífica. Muchas veces es mejor formarse una opinión propia a dejarse influir por esto. Esperaba mucho más de esta película y es que las cintas de Marvel ya se están convirtiendo en lo mismo. La mayoría son historias infantiles y aquí vemos a superhéroes comportándose como niños. Esto lo digo porque Iron Man/Tony Stark, un personaje que pareciera haber crecido durante la primera película de Avengers y después con Iron Man 3, aquí al parecer retrocedió hasta convertirse en un niño chillón y berrinchudo. Toda la trama gira en torno a una misión que sale mal en cierta parte de África, hay gente muerta y etc, etc, y 172 países deciden ponerle un «hasta aquí» a los Avengers por medio de los «Tratados de Sokovia.» Estos básicamente establecen que los Avengers estarán regulados por las Naciones Unidas y sólo podrán actuar cuando ellos dicen, haciendo cachitos el propósito de ser superhéroes. Tony Stark se pone de parte de esta petición porque… «motivos.» Realmente sólo lo acepta para que la trama siga adelante, pues la razón expuesta allí es sumamente ligera, débil y sin sentido. Aunque igual y propone una pregunta seria, ¿cuál es realmente el bien común? ¿Por una sola persona deberán de permitir que el mal triunfe? El único personaje que siempre ha sido consistente en el Universo Marvel es El Capitán América y tal vez por eso es mi superhéroe favorito de esta saga de cintas. Es el único que realmente es virtuoso y con una visión real del mundo, pues sabe que los gobiernos y las agendas de estos siempre van a cambiar y puede llegar el punto en el que no les convenga que existan los Avengers. Eso desata la escisión de los Avengers. Dos puntos de vista encontrados, uno respaldado por el niño consentido, rico y llorón representado por Tony Stark y otro representado por un verdadero héroe, Steve Rogers. Pero… Resulta que hay un villano que está maquinando una serie de tácticas para perjudicar todo esto. Ese es el toque de genialidad de la película, aunque los motivos del personaje sean muy vacíos y sólo sirvan para sustentar que las dos facciones de Avengers luchen entre si. La temática de Capitán América: Civil War gira en torno a la Venganza. El problema real es que en ningún momento se muestran las consecuencias de ejecutarla y eso es lo que mengua al personaje de Black Panther. Su único motivo dentro del filme es estar enojado y decir que se va a vengar. Ya cuando está por hacerlo, simplemente dice… Nah, mejor no. Me queda claro que Marvel está jugando a la segura con todas estas películas y no vamos a ver nunca algo de relevancia. Por lo menos espero que el segundo estreno de este año que es Doctor Strange, intente modificar y transformar el Universo Marvel en algo mágico, porqué si sigue así… La verdad es que ya me está aburriendo. De hecho para mi el punto más interesante de la cinta fue la aparición de Ant-Man, realmente le dio un respiro a la cinta. El nuevo Spider-Man es… patético. Escuchar la voz de un chamaquito y las bromas tontas que dice es insoportable. La nueva tía May es básicamente una zorra… Seguro le encantará a muchas personas. Si te ha gustado todo lo que saca Marvel, definitivamente tienes que ver Capitán América: Civil War. Si esperas que los personajes hayan evolucionado y ahora veas una trama compleja, oscura y llena de lecciones que van más allá de «ser bueno es bueno,» definitivamente mejor espera a verla en formato casero."
"Feb 3, 2019",positive," So I’m going to watch Avengers: Infinity War tomorrow (or today, when this review goes up!) but I didn’t really have the time to watch a lot of MCU films leading up to it… in fact I just squeezed this one in, but still! Let’s have a look at Civil War, the film that could be argued as the real Avengers 3, though I feel that’s unfair given the focus is still very much on Captain America rather than the ensemble of heroes around him. It’s also the film that introduces us to both the MCU’s Spider-Man and Black Panther, the latter of whom’s solo film would turn out to be more successful than the former, which no one would have guessed a few years ago! So let’s dive in! It’s scenes like this that make me appreciate how far the MCU has come… I mean Ant-Man and Scarlet Witch are in the same scene and both are just as legitimate a character as Cap. Crazy, but great, times. Helmut Zemo (Daniel Bruhl) – Zemo’s wife, child and father were killed in the Sokovia incident. Since then he has been blinded by thoughts of vengeance against the so-called heroes he deems solely responsible. Scott Lang / Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) – Lang is a thief who believes he can become a hero now he has the power of Hank Pym’s suit and particles… well, it’s time to put that to the test! Before we get the more obvious, action-oriented bit, I want to praise the job this film does balancing the cast and giving the large cast so much to do. Captain America is still very much himself, sticking to his principles and his allies, and Tony Stark is still very much arrogant, but also afraid and racked with guilt over things he’s done and once again he’s taking command and throwing what he can at the problem to make it go away. This is why their break up works. Bucky is somewhere in between his old self and the Winter Soldier, but by the end of the film he’s back to being like an old ally to Cap again, which makes it all the more heartbreaking when his past comes back to haunt him once again right at the end. Just when everyone found common ground Tony finds out Bucky killed his parents and then that’s it, all bets are off. The harsh words and brutal fight between Cap and Iron Man at the end of the film is great and dramatic, and the very end when Tony demands Steve leave the shield behind because “my father made that for you” is a proper hit in the gut, and really makes you believe that there friendship is irreversibly damaged. Then there’s the fact that while doing all this the film also introduces both Black Panther and Spider-Man to the MCU, handily skipping the origin stories for their respective solo films, and still by the time the big airport fight scene happens you feel they’re just as part of the cast as the characters who have been around since film 1. Tom Holland just owns the role from scene one, and Boseman’s Black Panther and his slip to hatred and vengeance, followed by his redemption, is a great story arc. That’s a true credit to both the writing and the acting that all that happens in the middle of a Captain America vs. Iron Man film, and it still fits. To top it all off you have some great scenes with Black Widow being torn as to which side to pick, you have some really pleasant scenes between Vision and Scarlet Witch, and even some of the other side characters like Falcon, War Machine and Ant-Man have at least a few funny or dramatic scenes each. It’s no wonder the Russos were chosen to juggle the Infinity War cast, they clearly have the knack. So now let’s get to the obvious: the aforementioned airport fight. That must have been a pain in the arse to plan and film, but hats off to them, because it’s quite the amazing show. Some funny moments (mostly from Spider-Man, Tom Holland just nails the funny mid-battle quips the character is known for straight away!), there some dramatic moments, but mostly there is just great hero-on-hero action. Ant-Man may steal the show for me though, not just for the scene when he enlarges himself (oo-er?) but I still laughed out loud in this rewatch when he gets Cap to enlarge a fuel truck he had shrank and tossed, only to wince when it explodes and say “Oh I thought that was a water truck… sorry.” That being said some of the other fight scenes are right up there. Cap and Winter Soldier escaping the swat team has some really well shot fight scenes, both using Cap’s shield and Bucky’s metal arm. Likewise the car chase straight after involving Black Panther is pulse-pounding, and Winter Soldier’s later escape from capture, that sees him out-martial-art-ing (that’s not a correct phrase, but whatever) a bunch of characters in some short but brutal fight scenes are all really good fun to watch. I also like the bit of continuity as to why Wakanda is suddenly in the spotlight. Vibranium stolen from them was used to create Ultron’s super-hard body, so feeling responsible they started to send out humanitarian missions, one of which happened to get caught up in the Crossbones explosion, leading to Wakanda spearheading the want to put heroes under control and take part in a global conference about it. It works well, and makes the fact that they were a non-event up until now make perfect sense. MCU films often have the problem of a poor villain, but Civil War doesn’t really have this problem as you can kind of argue that Iron Man is the lead villain. That being said, he and Cap are manipulated into fighting by Zemo, so really he is the lead antagonist, and while he doesn’t suffer from the same problems as a lot of the other bad guys, he’s not perfect. I mean, he’s nothing like the comics Zemo, but I don’t think anyone was expecting him to walk around with a purple balaclava stuck on his face due to “Adhesive X”, so I didn’t mind that. In fact I like the fact he was a broken man, his entire family wiped out, but he knew full well he couldn’t actually take the Avengers in any kind of fight so instead used his intelligence to get them to take each other out instead. So why is he in “The Bad” section then? His plan makes no sense. It relies far to heavily on coincidence to actually be planned. Think about it, if Iron Man hadn’t gone to the prison to visit Falcon and managed to convince him to tell him where Cap and Bucky were, he wouldn’t have been there to see the video of his parents’ death and turn on them. I know the film is called Civil War and all that, but if he had just locked Cap and Bucky (and coincidentally Iron Man when he turned up) in a room and unleashed the five or six other super-powered Winter Soldiers on them it would have been a more realistic plan, if not a bit more clichéd. Captain America: Civil War is jam-packed full of action and great character moments, dialogue and debuts, yet still manages to tell a story focused on Captain America, on what makes him tick and his loyalty to his friends. With one plothole that doesn’t really derail the film, it’s hard not to just applaud it for being able to juggle so much and still make it a satisfying film. Top stuff."

"Jan 15, 2019",positive," This installment sees the Avengers facing pressure to be policed by a United Nation task force in light of an incident that results in collateral damage.  As Marvel Comic entries go, “Captain America: Civil War” falls somewhere in the middle of the pack. Given the track record of success, that isn’t exactly a bad thing – with “Civil War” providing what fans have come to expect, while also delving into some darker territory. This installment sees the Avengers facing pressure to be policed by a United Nation task force in light of an incident that results in collateral damage.  Captain America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) wants the Avengers to remain free to defend without government assistance, while Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) believes it is time that the Avengers are put in check. This leads to conflict between the two, with fellow Avengers taking sides. Things escalate further when a friend from Rogers’ past emerges as the key suspect in the latest terrorist attack, with Rogers determined to clear his friend’s name. Following along the same lines as “Batman v Superman,” “Civil War” provides an interesting starting point – debating the pros and cons of what these superheroes do and if their actions that result in destructions of cities, and some casualties, are really worth it. “Civil War” seems even more invested in this premise than “Batman v Superman,” making this one of the darker Marvel films in the recent franchise. I found the tone refreshing, although some may be put off by all the chattiness and debate in a movie that is nearly two-and-a-half hours long. That’s not to say there isn’t action as well, culminating in the sequence most fans anticipated – the throw down between a dozen Avengers. It’s a sequence that delivers a fun excursion that keeps the proceedings from getting too dark and heavy. Then there is the introduction into the Disney Marvel world of Spider-Man (Tom Holland), which breathes more life and fun into the franchise. Post credits tease future adventures for the web slinger, which judging by his appearance here is something I am looking forward to as well. “Captain America: Civil War” may not be quite up to the same level as the previous “Captain America: The Winter Soldier,” but it is still a satisfying entry into a universe that continues to expand. Comedy Central’s Jordan Peele and Keegan-Michael Key make a pretty good transition from small screen to big screen in this comedy that is a bit uneven at times, but when it fires it’s as funny and smart as anything in recent memory. Peele and Key play Rell and Clarence, cousins who set out to recover Rell’s kitten after he is kidnapped. While rescuing the cat, they are mistaken for ruthless killers and soon find themselves right in the middle of a gang war. I’ve never seen the duo’s sketch comedy show, so I can’t compare this film to what fans have come to expect. As an outsider however, I can say that I found their chemistry quite enjoyable – and their humor worked pretty well in a feature film. Peele co-wrote the screenplay, which plays with a lot of absurd ideas (one being how this kitten can basically make even the most hardened criminal turn to putty). There is some really smart social commentary at times with the script taking some very nice chances at getting laughs in uncomfortable places. Not every joke sticks however, with some bits not as inspired as the rest. For every misfire though, there is something pretty brilliant (my favorite involving Clarence imagining himself in the middle of the iconic George Michael music video “Faith” during a drug-induced haze). I may not have laughed at everything in “Keanu,” but I laughed enough to truly enjoy myself. “Keanu” is rated R for violence, language throughout, drug use and sexuality/nudity and is now playing at the Regal Bowling Green Stadium 10 and Highland Cinemas in Glasgow."
"Jan 9, 2019",positive," One of the biggest problems with superhero team-up movies is making sure that they don’t feel like a paint-by-numbers action kaboom where the only benefit is familiar characters. And the main way to make sure that doesn’t happen is to make said familiar characters emotionally invested in the current conflict’s outcome, beyond the whole we-must-win-the-day schtick. What I’m saying is, this movie should really be titled Captain America: HELP WE ARE ALL FULL OF FEELINGS. And that’s a very good thing. It’s frankly astounding that any film can contain so many separate, distinct character arcs, and still come out clean. That said, Civil War doesn’t quite feel like a single story, more a series of vignettes interspersed with some very imaginative action sequences. That’s not to say that the film lacks cohesion, only that any film with this many main characters usually ends up with a slight Love Actually vibe. (I just compared a Marvel movie to Love Actually. Apparently, anything is possible in this bizarre universe we live in.) For those who are familiar with the comics, the narrative of the movie might come as something of a surprise. Rather than a Registration Act that requires superheroes to give up their secret identities (something of a redundancy in the MCU when so many of them don’t bother), the government regulation that our heroes are asked to consider is at the behest of the United Nations, who would like control of when and how the Avengers are deployed. Tony thinks this is a good idea, Steve does not. Then Peggy Carter passes away, and her niece Sharon shares a quote from her aunt at the funeral—one that advises a young Sharon to compromise until she cannot, and then stand firm and make the world bend to her. Needless to say, Steve takes that advice to heart. Joss Whedon had initially said that he wanted the second Avengers film to be a deeply personal affair, and many comics fans assumed that he was going to tackle the Civil War arc as a result. Instead, we got Age of Ultron, which was enjoyable in some aspects, a bit of a mess in others, and not anywhere near as personal as we might have expected. Now we have Captain America: Civil War, a film in which every single character decision is deeply personal, deeply emotional. What’s impressive about the undertaking is how everyone’s points of view are entertained, and while there might be certain characters you agree with overall, no one is depicted as entirely unsympathetic or even entirely wrong. It’s an inevitable step between a team full of vastly opposing personalities, but a painful one. At the core of this fight are Captain America and Iron Man, and deciding whose “team” you’re on is a far woollier choice than audiences might have expected. It’s easy to blame Tony Stark for these proceedings because Tony is egotistical and arrogant, even when he means well, and that makes him appear at fault more often than not. But the film is good at showing the places where Steve Rogers is uniquely unbendable, places where he could compromise and chooses not to, places where his righteousness is less appealing. The truth of the matter is that Steve doesn’t want the Avengers under UN control because Steve Rogers doesn’t trust anyone. In response to idea of these Sokovia Accords, he feels obligated to point out that every member, every country has their own agenda. Which is a fair point, but fails to include the fact that all people generally do, himself included. Captain America doesn’t really trust the will of the people—he thinks it’s far safer for the Avengers to use their own judgment on what missions they take. This is in keeping with Steve’s development in the MCU, particularly as it pertains to Winter Soldier; when he tried to put his trust in the system, it turned out that Hydra was behind that system all along. On the other side of this we have Tony Stark, who, despite being overly-insistent that all problems are his problems, is mainly desperate to keep his friends safe. That is his primary motivation throughout the entire process, a motivation that makes more sense when we learn that his relationship with Pepper Potts hasn’t been working out. (On the one hand, I’m hardly surprised given his recent activities, on the other hand NO YOU TAKE IT BACK.) These are the only people that Tony Stark has in the whole world, but he doesn’t know how to get that across. Or rather, he chooses not to get that across because most of his personal relationships end in abnegation, death, or, you know, attempted murder (thanks, Obadiah!). To his credit, these are problems that he is clearly trying to work through at the outset; we discover that Tony has developed an immersive virtual reality therapy app of sorts, one that allows people to reach into their memories and relive traumatic events with better outcomes to receive closure. He shows an entire room of students his final memory of his parents, and manages to tell his father that he loves him before Howard and Maria drive to their deaths. Both Tony and Steve have viable reasons for thinking that they’re doing the right thing. Both of them make serious errors in judgment as a result: Tony puts Wanda under house arrest, and Steve causes a fair share of collateral damage in effort to help Bucky escape capture. Both of them wish they could compromise their way out of this, but both of them have wildly different ideas about what compromise should entail. And then Bucky is hijacked, and Steve is useless for negotiations from that point forward—particularly once Bucky tells him that their current enemy Col. Helmut Zemo (Daniel Brühl) seems to be after the other five Winter Soldiers programmed by Hydra. Steve Rogers’s fight with Hydra has been a fascinating sticking point for the character throughout these films. Because they turned out to be the power behind S.H.I.E.L.D., the protective organization that Howard Stark and Peggy Carter built, and also behind Bucky’s brainwashing into the Winter Soldier, Captain America’s stake in dismantling Hydra is personal beyond his role in fighting them during WWII. Bucky is most personal of all these offenses, Steve’s only living link to his past once Peggy is gone, his best friend throughout the majority of his life. Which makes it all the more interesting that even Bucky calls Steve on his devotion by the end of the film, positing that he’s not worth so much trouble. Of course, from a personal standpoint, Bucky is… but his comment could almost be read an in indictment of Steve’s unwillingness to take pause and think where his best friend is concerned. From the springboard of Tony and Steve, we come to the other Avengers, who all have different stakes in this fight. Sam Wilson has been on board with helping Cap find his pal since day one, but having the Winter Soldier in the back of their getaway car turns out to be even less enjoyable than he imagined. (The prickly camaraderie that develops between Bucky and Sam is easily one of the highlights of the film.) Rhodey is on Tony’s side due less to their long friendship than to his respect for chain of command, every inch the respectable soldier—let’s be honest, regulation is everything he’s been asking for from Tony since Iron Man 2. Vision believes there is a correlation in the escalation of threats to the multitude of super peoples, and believes that oversight could only help. Hawkeye backs Steve because he’s never been Tony’s biggest fan in the first place, and nothing defines Clint Barton so well as being a perpetual underdog. Ant-Man joins Cap because he’s just jazzed to be there. (Also, Hank Pym isn’t exactly a fan of the Stark family.) Black Widow plays her cards close as always, but the truth is easy to discern in the few words she chooses to say: The Avengers have become her family. All she really wants is for that family to stay whole, even if it means being regulated. But once she realizes that Steve won’t be won over, she backs off, giving up on the hope that the conflict will be resolved easily. The person in this film who feels most done wrong by is Wanda Maximoff, on both a real-world level and a storytelling level. She is badly treated once the conflict is underway because of her near-unlimited and dangerous powers, a treatment made worse for the fact that Vision—the one supervising her house arrest—appears to have a crush on her. On the one hand, Vision is young by existence standards, making it easy to read his attentions as boyish and harmless. On the other hand, it’s discomfiting that Wanda should be held at bay by someone harboring such feelings, and these attentions make Vision seem manipulative and controlling at the very least. She gets the last word, telling him that she cannot control the fear she instills in others, only her own fear. But it doesn’t change the fact that the movie seems at a loss for what to do with Wanda’s power, and that alone feels circumspect in a universe harboring figures like Thor and the Hulk. In the midst of these characters that we know, we are gifted two new faces—T’Challa of Wakanda, and Peter Parker of Queens. Black Panther’s arrival to the MCU is a long time coming, and Chadwick Boseman plays him with incredible poise and grace. We get all of two minutes’ introduction to him and his father and the position of Wakanda in this world, and that’s really all we need to get invested (though we obviously want much more). Because T’Challa believes that Bucky is responsible for his father’s death, it seems as though we’re in for a standard revenge plot. Yet it is Black Panther alone who is able to put aside his all-consuming desire for vengeance, and step away before it is too late. It is a perfect introductory arc, in keeping with what comics fans know of T’Challa, a man known for his intelligence and consideration. It’s going to be hard to wait for that solo film now. Our surprise package comes in the form of a brand new Spider-Man, which confused a fair share of viewers leading up to the film’s release, seeing as he was being played by Andrew Garfield only two years ago. But Tom Holland’s take on Parker is finally as young as Spider-Man was at his inception, a teenager being played by an actual teenager. (For the record, Peter is supposed to be fifteen years old, and Holland was seventeen when he was cast.) What’s more, this is the first version of Spider-Man who appears to come from a visibly lower class bracket; he lives in an old, crowded building in Queens, his room is cramped and awkwardly shaped, and nothing that he owns looks new. Holland’s awkwardness lends Peter an authenticity that audiences have never seen on screen; Spider-Man’s one-liners are more a product of nervousness than true wit. And Tony’s first meeting with the wonder kid makes it abundantly clear that they have a future as mentor and apprentice—not only is Tony the right guy to upgrade Peter’s equipment, but they have something key in common: they both chose to become superheroes due to an overpowering sense of guilt. (Peter tells Tony than when someone with his kind of powers chooses not to use them, people get hurt, an obvious reference to the death of Uncle Ben.) The Avengers-on-Avengers remix battle is one of the most entertaining fight sequences that a Marvel movie has ever produced, and that’s mostly down to a sharp balance of levity and pain. This has a lot to do with the fact that very few of these people are personally angry with each other, and a few of them have no emotional investment in the fight whatsoever. Ant-Man merely does what’s asked of him, with no particular upset toward anyone who knocks him down a peg. Spider-Man is going on Tony’s orders, and only aims to capture, never to wound. Hawkeye and Widow are basically play-fighting, to the point where Wanda tosses Natasha out of the way because Clint was “pulling his punches.” For all the real fear bound up in this fight, there’s an equal amount of love that simply can’t be quashed. That all comes to a close when Cap and Bucky get away on the Avenger’s jet, with War Machine and Falcon in pursuit. Tony orders Vision to take down Falcon, but he’s distracted by Wanda’s injuries and misses, hitting Rhodey instead and sending him into a free fall. Watching him hit the ground as Iron Man and Falcon struggle to reach him is sickening, and while Rhodey survives the fall, his immobilizing injuries make him the true casualty of this war. Ever the soldier, he later tells Tony that he stands by the choices that he made, that he has always known the risks of combat and continued to do his job. It’s an absolution of sorts, but not one that Tony Stark is likely to take to heart. The final act comes when Tony receives the information he needs to confirm Cap’s story, proof that Bucky was not responsible for the UN bombing that killed T’Challa’s father. But the extra information that Steve and Bucky were going on proves to be a red herring; Zemo, an oddly silent villain through the tale’s proceedings, has killed off the remaining Winter Soldiers, and offers up something else instead—footage of a mission taken on by the Winter Soldier in 1991. Footage of James Buchanan Barnes murdering Tony’s parents. And when Tony asks the most important question of all—whether or not Steve knew Bucky had done this—Steve Rogers is not able to give his usually noble answer. Instead, he has to admit that he protected his friend, and has known all along. All superhero villains tend to be more interesting when they have a real personal connection to the people they are trying to destroy. It’s the reason why Ronan and Ultron are ultimately less engaging than Loki and The Mandarin. In Zemo, we have someone who is not acting out of a desire for power or glory, but a man who simply wants to ruin the Avengers’ lives for ruining his. And in his strange wisdom, he knows precisely how to do it. He knows exactly what buttons to push. He knows that Tony Stark will want to kill Bucky Barnes for murdering his mother (not his parents, not his father, his mother), and he knows that Steve Rogers will never allow that to happen. And while Tony’s revelation is immediate and horrific, it is Steve that we’re to watch. Because the movie isn’t called Iron Man: Civil War, is it? It’s not even called Avengers: Civil War. It’s got Captain America’s name on it because this movie is ultimately here to teach us something about him. What we have—as we always did—is a beautifully unique rendition of a character who would have been easy to paint in a stale, dull hue. This version of Captain America postulates that the true way to be “the greatest” American is to be an individualist, albeit a truly empathetic one. Steve Rogers really isn’t much of a team player in a universal sense; he’s not a “good little soldier”; he’s only a good leader when backed by a crew that is well-suited to his particular way of doing things. He’s anti-establishment at a fundamental level, which is a refreshing thing to reinforce in a hero whose origins are bound up in nationalism. So he fights to rescue his best friend—who deserves a second chance—at the expense of every other relationship he has forged, because it’s the right thing to do. When Tony tells Steve that he doesn’t deserve the Captain America shield, Steve chooses to discard it, and this seems to work on two levels; first off, Tony has conflated the image of Captain America with the man Steve Rogers (which is to be expected, given how Howard built the man up to his son as a figure to emulate); secondly, Steve has no difficulty casting aside the symbol that is Captain America, particularly in that moment, if it means saving Bucky’s life. And this is central to everything that makes Steve the man who can wear that uniform in the first place—as the saying goes, no one who is capable of getting themselves elected president should be allowed to do the job. And by the end of the film, Steve pointedly understands that as well. The letter he leaves Tony is half apology, half self-realization. He acknowledges that withholding information on the death of Tony’s parents was a selfish move on his part. He acknowledges that he has always been a man apart from others, and that in this capacity, the Avengers belong more to Tony than they ever have to him. But he also acknowledges that he cannot walk away from Tony Stark, or their friends. That he cannot leave the role of Captain America, he can only pause his portrayal of it. So he gathers their team and tells Tony that they will wait for his call. Emmet Asher-Perrin had so much excess adrenaline after watching that movie, she probably could have stopped a moving car, too.

"Dec 8, 2018",positive," Last month, I was severely disappointed with the meeting of two comic-book titans on the screen. Batman v. Superman shot big, but missed.  With film trailers pointing to a rich philosophical divide between Bruce & Clark, culminating in what could have been the Battle Royale of all things geekdom, instead, the film was a mess, one failing at the heavy task of “world-building” multiple franchises for Warner Bros. while trying to build a coherent narrative, worthy of the timeless heroes.  I don’t want to make this review a comparison piece, because I’m sure you’ll find many of those on the internet, formally written as articles or scribbled on random comment threads.  However, this instinct to bring up BvS is no accident, nor is it unfair to draw a comparison, as at one time, both films were set to open the same day.  I’m glad they didn’t, because the space of time between their releases has given me time to realize all the things that could have gone wrong with Captain America: Civil War, and I’m glad to say that it looks like it escaped such things. WOW! What a fantastic film! Overall, the two movies deal with similar themes: a philosophical impasse between two heroes, each being manipulated by circumstances, agendas, and gut-feelings.  It’s potentially powerful material, and with the vast histories of the DC & Marvel universes, even though both films were almost explicitly marketed as “adaptations” of popular story arcs (DC Comics‘ The Dark Knight Returns & Marvel‘s Civil War), each film plotted its own course.  I believe it was the wisest course for both.  Still, as I alluded too, ‘BvS’ crumbled under too many plotlines, unconventional takes on long-established characters, and the burden of establishing so many new films stemming from it.  Civil War does not. I should say this early on: Civil War is not Avengers 2.5, but it is.  At the heart of this film, we find Cap & Bucky (even though, arguably, it made a better Avengers film than Avengers: Age of Ultron).  We know his guilt over Bucky’s “death” in Captain America: The First Avenger, almost stopped him from being the hero, and guilt over what Bucky had become in Captain America: The Winter Soldier warred on him as well.  Still, in this film, we see one friend who won’t give up on another, even when all goes against them.  The war between loyalties, yes, is stretched between all the heroes featured in the film, but at the center, we see Cap choose his belief in Bucky, even over Tony Stark.  I would be remiss to say that our Golden Boy doesn’t keep his shine throughout the film.  I felt a real palpable shift in my own allegiance of who was “right” in the film, when all is known in the end.  My takeaway from it all, in the effort to avoid spoilers, is that relationships are messy, and when there is a competition for loyalties, someone will lose out, even (and especially when) we do our best to not hurt them, and it will have a rippling effect throughout our lives. Just like Avengers: Age of Ultron, we get another jet-setting adventure.  I lost count of how many times a city or country was plastered across the screen, signalling a transition in location, but we go all over here.  Still, I didn’t ever feel lost.  The plot moved along at a pace that never slogged, and even after a 147-minute runtime, I wasn’t looking for it to end.  Crowd-pleasing isn’t always said as a compliment in all circles, but here, I can share that the theater I was in cheered, laughed, and awed throughout.  There are some great surprises for general audiences within this film, but nothing that comic-buff couldn’t see coming. While I could go into a lengthy dissection of all characters and their loyalties, I’ll try to be brief in what needs to be said.  Someone who won’t get mentioned much in many reviews, but who brought the goods was William Hurt, returning as Thaddeus Ross, now Secretary of State.  Seeing him without the Hulk and nary much mention of him at all was a little strange, but I’ve always respected Hurt as an actor, and he didn’t disappoint here, acting as the face of the catalyst for dealing with the heroes’ recurring collateral damage through the Sokovia Accords, a global response initiative aimed at keeping the heroes on call and in check by the world governments.  This legislation is brought about alongside news of a terrorist incident implicating Bucky Barnes, also known as the former Soviet assassin, The Winter Soldier. All of this together unsettles Captain America and stirs him to resist, and several fall in line behind him for various reasons. Through the preceding Marvel films, we have seen these heroes witness a corrupted S.H.I.E.L.D. organization, and they feel reason to defy the directives, if on nothing else but the idea of precedence alone.  On the other side, we see Iron Man, who feels guilt for the damage he and others have caused.  Falling in line among others behind him, we have two new heroes: Black Panther & Spider-Man.  Black Panther, played by Chadwick Boseman, was probably my favorite aspect of the film: his power, presence, and sense of duty were incredible.  From his story arc, we get a powerful lesson on seeking justice before vengeance, merciful in ways but just as resolute.  Retaliation can often bring other hurts into our own lives, and seeing his story spoke the most powerful lesson in the film to me. Spider-Man, on the other hand, was just pure glee.  He’s absolutely incredible to see alongside all the others we’ve known in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and his adolescent nature, brought out wonderfully by Tom Holland, made him feel unique, as he played with the adults.  I can’t wait to see more from both characters moving forward. Civil War never felt beholden to “world building” of establishing the many films that will be following; however, it did feel richly constructed upon the many films made prior, which is more than great.  One could argue that much of the movie-going public is spending time engrossed in multi-season storylines via streaming on Netflix and Amazon Prime, so relying upon what came before isn’t the problem it could have been in years past with other properties.  Don’t expect hand-holding as an audience here.  You’ll go from scenes featuring a multi-colored, floating android to a man who can change his size at will.  It’s now expected you saw all the films that preceded, and if you did, I believe you’ll be witnessing something special in the entertainment landscape: serialized blockbusters, where characters can drop in and out of narratives with little thought against it by the audience.  I’m excited for all that is possible now in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and this film just proves the quality hasn’t quit yet."
"Nov 19, 2018",positive,"Overall, Civil War is the most adult and realized film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and it comes highly recommended."
"Nov 14, 2018",positive," I am slowly trying to calm myself after watching this movie. (inserts standing ovation and Shia LeBouf clap) Marvel shocked us all when they announced a special fan screening of Captain America:Civil War three weeks prior to the movie coming out. Normally most studios only show high profile screenings a few days before the movie launches. I have to say this is probably one of the best films in the Marvel Universe if not the best one yet which makes sense as to why they decided to screen the movie so early. CA:CW is also trending high on Rotten Tomatoes with a 100% score pre release (Now 92%). This movie gives you more of what you were missing from Avengers: Age of Ultron in the sequel to the last Captain America: Winter Soldier. In CA:CW we are starting to see the destruction the Avengers have left behind in their plan to keep the world safe. Though their intentions are good many innocent people have died from the many battles of the Avengers. In this movie, you see the toil this has taken on characters like Wanda Maximoff, Tony Stark, and Bucky Barnes to name a few. This movie has a different feel from the others since despite the amazing action sequences (we will talk about this later) it really relied on the characters to showcase their amazing acting capabilities. You see a reversal of characters between Stark and Rogers. Stark who is atoning for the wrong his weapons and his role in the Avengers has made to Rogers who is taking a stand for what he truly believes in and allowing himself to break the law and stand against the United Nations. We also see Bucky who is not the evil Winter Soldier we saw in the first Captain America movie to now a tortured sole who is remembering all of the terrible acts he has committed. We finally see the once tight knit Avengers take sides in who they believe is right. Should they stand with Iron Man who believes that they should be in check by the United Nations or Captain America who feels that the United Nations serves their own agenda which might not align with saving the world for the right reasons. This puts many of the Avengers on opposing sides which leads to an epic showdown of our beloved heroes at an airport. One of the great things about CA:CW is that they truly paired each opposing hero up very well which led to a realistic and glorious fight sequence. In addition to our normal heroes we are introduced to two exciting new additions into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Black Panther and Spider-Man. I believe that these two characters truly stole the show. Chadwick Boseman did a superb job as portraying Black Panther and does not disappoint in his action scenes. The 19 year old newcomer Tom Holland left the audience in laughter and excitement as he did a great job of holding his own in the movie and keeping Marvel fans excited for the new Spider-Man returning home to Marvel. With a great storyline and amazing special effects and actions scenes many fans will forget about the bad taste Batman vs Superman left in their mouths and will be excited for the new installments of Marvel movies to come. DC Comics should be worried because Civil War has definitely set the bar high and comic book fans across the world will not be disappointed."
"Nov 9, 2018",positive," Well another super-sized Marvel Comics super-hero saga hits the big screen with the selected saviour Captain America taking the top billing on the marquee. Thus, the pulsating popcorn pleaser ‘Captain America: Civil War’ arrives on the scene to giddy audiences that have been loyal and fixated on the successful spring of mighty Marvel heroes that have been paraded to viewers throughout the last few years. Thankfully, ‘Captain America: Civil War’ carries on the tradition of spry super-hero-studded spectacles that have been glorious and adventurous from the stable of Marvel-based movies guaranteed to win over the enthusiastic hearts of avid comicbook fanboys everywhere. Joyously overstuffed and convincingly extensive with a super-team armed with crime-fighting excess, ‘Civil War’ seizes the moment to introduce a noteworthy twist: two factions of rescuing super-powers engaging in some explosive in-house fighting led by two of Marvel Comics main standouts in Chris Evans’s Captain America and Robert Downey Jr.’s Iron Man. Co-directors Anthony Russo and Rene Russo were instinctively crafty to link the overly successful ‘Iron Man’ film franchise to the ‘Captain America: Civil War’ inner circle to ensure an even more treasured toxic atmosphere. Super-hero fans will get a thrill of witnessing the extra add-ons concerning other dynamic titans to join the action-packed festivities involving Team Captain America versus Team Iron Man. True, ‘Civil War’ has its share of flaws but that does not take away from this heroes-in-crisis flick demonstrating its ambitious overtones. So what has caused the bad blood among the great and grand good guys known for protecting the world from evil dominance and destruction? Essentially, the theme of collateral damage, the involvement regarding civilian-related deaths and injuries plus the world-wide backlash has created a controversy pitted against The Avengers. Specifically, Captain America (aka Steve Rogers) and Scarlet Witch/Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen)  are responsible for the boisterous battle that caused such negative sensation resulting in political turmoil. Avengers head honcho Iron Man (aka Tony Stark) is dealing with his own personal regrets in the ill-advised creation of the unpredictable Ultron. The political authority want to hold Iron Man, second-in-command Captain America and the rest of the Avengers accountable for the global devastation that have taking its toll when trying to oversee the potential harm wreaking havoc on humanity. Leading the charge in putting a watchful eye on the labeled reckless Avengers is Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) that suggests the super-group be monitored by the United Nations. Naturally friction develops between the super-heroes that either agree with Ross’s UN restriction policies or disagree with being placed under a microscope that threatens to handcuff their free-wheeling heroic duties. All these contrasting beliefs eventually turn into epic back-and-forth confrontations where the raging Avengers are at odds with each other. For Stark/Iron Man’s stance, he is willing to toe the line and ultimately agree that his crew needs to tone down their tenacious tactics as crime-stoppers. Iron Man’s consciousness, particularly in the case of a disillusioned mother (Alfre Woodward) making him feel guilt-ridden over her son’s death during an intense Battle of Sokovia, is probably the main factor behind his decision to have his team reigned in a bit from the political watchdogs. Siding with Iron Man’s viewpoint are the likes of Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Vision (Paul Bettany) and War Machine (Don Cheadle). As for Rogers/Captain America, he is not too thrilled being put in check by the intrusive governmental pencil-pushers that want to scrutinise the team’s every move. Standing with Captain America firmly are Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and the aforementioned Scarlet Witch. On top of Captain America’s current Avengers-oriented strife in his contentious mingling with Iron Man and his ardent backers, he now finds himself trying to defend his old buddy-turned-wanted man Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) who is accused of killing civilians. Iron Man believes in Winter Soldier’s innocence and goes so far as to help him escape. Yes…Winter Soldier does come with more baggage attached to him, mainly in the form of the menacing Zemo (Daniel Bruhl). The Russos and screenwriters Christopher Marckus and Stephen McFeely (all attached to the previous ‘Captain America: Winter Soldier’) provide the eyeful visual effects that predictably stimulate and effectively add to the overload of frenzied frolicking  in this boisterous blockbuster. Certainly the deepened angst among this bombastic bunch works far more solidly than what was displayed in the stiffened and problematic ‘Batman v Superman’. The notion that the entire globe and its leaders are weary of all the collective chaos at the hands of the Avengers trying to save their hides is a bit ridiculous. Besides, why are not the foes of the Avengers put on the hot coals for the societal ruination? It seems rather counter-productive to chastise the noble super-powers offering the safety of mankind yet the detractors not being grateful for the services that the Avengers bring to the table. It is somewhat convoluted to think that the global community are sour on our heralded heroes or that the heat generated within the walls will completely destroy the Avengers and their colourful, capable colleagues. The movie’s aptly entitled ‘Civil War’ does invite more punch to the proceedings especially when a who’s who of super-hero showstoppers join the feisty fray at hand. The noted inclusion of defiant do-gooders are packed with the likes of Spider-Man (Tom Holland), the retired returnee Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), and nifty newcomer Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman). No doubt ‘Captain America: Civil War’ is the impish and energising launch pad for upcoming Marvel-induced movies waiting to make their future distinctive arrival on the big screen. Although Evans’ steady and charismatic Captain America more than holds his own as the solo act billed in the film’s title, one cannot overlook Downey’s compelling Iron Man as the reliable source that lifts the profile of Evans’s masked wonder. This is indeed a collaborative big score for the glorified costumed cast but special kudos are reserved for Stan’s killing culprit as well as Boseman’s African president assuming the slick and resourceful Black Panther. Yeah, ‘Captain America: Civil War’ is true to its frenetic form as revved up entertainment preparing moviegoers for the upcoming summertime sizzle at the box office. After all, the on-screen Marvel Comics gravy train keeps moving merrily along so stay tuned. Frank Ochieng has contributed film reviews to SF Crowsnest off and on since 2003.

"Nov 1, 2018",positive,"Armed with the confidence that can only come from an unprecedented record of sustained success that's without comparison in this genre, Civil War emerges as as the strongest offering yet from Marvel Studios."
"Nov 1, 2018",neutral," With Batman v Superman proving unsatisfactory to many audience members craving to see their favourite heroes beat the crap out of each other, all eyes are now on Marvel Studios to see if they can accomplish what DC fumbled. But the two films have more than just duelling super-egos in common: both are crammed with characters from across their respective universes, both are establishing groundwork for the immediate future, both take inspiration from classic stories from the source material, and both are really, really long. But whilst Dawn of Justice strained under the weight of its ambitions, barely making it to the finish line in one piece, Captain America: Civil War balances all of its moving parts effortlessly to craft what could easily be the MCU’s grandest adventure yet. Those expecting a beat-for-beat adaptation of Mark Millar’s original Civil War storyline are going to be disappointed, but given the state of the Marvel Universe right now and the company’s lack of key comic book characters that was never going to happen. Instead, the film lifts key elements whilst mostly telling its own story, and in the process has turned what was originally just an excuse to force heroes into conflict into a legitimately gripping war of ethics. Whilst this is still Cap’s story and his views are generally portrayed as the correct ones, the film does a good job of justifying the other point-of-view; nobody feels drastically out of character like some did in the comics. The story has a grand scope as it hops around the world and brings in so many characters old and new, but unlike the competition it never feels disorienting or poorly developed. Even with its many disparate parts, every piece is under control and everything important is kept in the foreground. It’s this kind of thoughtful design that makes the film’s epic runtime breeze by, and even though certain characters do have smaller parts they never feel short-changed. There is never a moment where a scene was cut too short or moment was left to drag; everything is in perfect order. It is, however, not without fault. The film does blow its wad in the scale department a little too early, following what’s easily the most fantastic fight sequence in superhero movie history with an admittedly more emotional but less impressive final battle, and the film’s big third-act reveal feels a little too telegraphed and is mainly just there to reinforce conflict. But the film does have a strong open ending, leaving the universe in an uncertain state of flux much like The Winter Soldier did, but again it never feels like they’re forcefully teasing future movies. Every other character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe makes an appearance in this movie, so covering everyone is just going to be redundant. Long story short, every returning player is as good as ever and all are given just the right amount of screen time to shine. The tempestuous relationship between Chris Evans’ Cap and Robert Downey Jr’s Iron Man takes centre stage here, and what began in The Avengers as playful bickering has evolved into a true conflict of ideals. But even within all their clashing, they never forget that they’re usually allies and they both understand and even somewhat respect the other’s point of view; again, their motivations never feel skewed just to force hostility. But within all of that are also great little character moments for the other recurring characters; it’s great to see the Ant-Man geek out over meeting The Avengers, Falcon and Winter Solider exchange barbs about leg room in a car, or the burgeoning relationship between Vision and Scarlet Witch. It’s also fun to see William Hurt return as “Thunderbolt” Ross, finally connecting The Incredible Hulk back into the overarching story in a meaningful way (now we just need Abomination and Leader to become relevant again). But even with all that, audiences are sure to be talking all about the movie’s fantastic introductions to Black Panther and Spider-Man. Chadwick Boseman makes for an excellent Panther, balancing the character’s honour and pride with a lust for vengeance, turning what could have easily been yet another piece of Marvel cross-promotion into a key piece of the film’s thematic conflict. Tom Holland’s performance as the third cinematic web slinger finally embraces the character’s potential on screen, creating a Spider-Man that is optimistic and the butt of many jokes but one who can still stand toe-to-toe with these powerhouses of the universe. Holland’s screen time may be brief and it could be argued his story is superfluous to the plot, but everything about his scenes is executed flawlessly and I can’t wait to see him take centre stage in his own movie next summer. If there is a weak link in the cast, it’s Daniel Bruhl as the villainous mastermind Zemo. Bruhl puts in a strong performance as the character, but the film doesn’t do a great job of explaining his motives, giving only the vaguest of hints before dumping it all on us right before the end. He’s like a living embodiment of forced conflict; everything he does accomplishes nothing but getting characters to the point of hostility. That all results in some absolutely amazing fights, but it’s still an obvious ploy nonetheless. On a spectacle level, Civil War blows all of the other MCU movies out of the water. Every action sequence in this movie is absolutely on-point and, given that the second unit directors are the guys who brought you John Wick, that should be no surprise. It really feels like the filmmakers explored every possible way these characters could utilize their powers in combat and took advantage of that, creating for some truly outstanding mash-ups that are as imaginatively conceived as they are choreographed. The camerawork and editing is fast and frenetic, but never in a way that obscures the action. Instead, it amplifies the intensity of the conflict, making every blow impactful and awe-inspiring. The visual effects aren’t always completely convincing, but because of how light and fantastical the film looks it manages to get away with it. What they lack in believability they more than make up for in ingenuity, crafting incredible moments that could have only been accomplished digitally. Captain America: Civil War delivers on all its promises to be a fantastic ride and then some, proving that complex superhero movies packed with story threads and characters can be made if done with care. It improves on its source material by making the conflict feel more natural and with better parallels to real-world issues, rather than falling prey to petty squabbles that go against previous character development. It’s a near flawless piece of blockbuster entertainment, one that probably won’t convert anyone uninterested in the franchise so far, but for all us True Believers invested in this universe it’s an absolute treat. All I can now ask is this: how the hell is Infinity War going to top it?"
"Nov 1, 2018",positive," Awhile back, HIGHLANDER: THE SERIES show runner David Abramowitz described that enterprise as “a Talmudic discussion with ass-kicking.” That assessment frequently springs to mind while watching CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR. The movie, the latest in Marvel’s cinematic universe (aka the MCU), unfolds with reasonable logic after the events of 2015’s AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON. The world is already troubled by the fact that the Avengers, although they saved more people than they harmed, still racked up substantial civilian casualties when the country of Sekovia became unmoored from the rest of planet Earth. On a mission in Nigeria to stop a terrorist (Frank Grillo) seeking to get his hands on a bio-weapon, Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) and his team accidentally take out a building. The United Nations, including the U.S., think some oversight is in order. That august body wants the Avengers to sign accords that are essentially a contract saying the superheroes will deploy at the behest of the U.N., and only then. Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), who wasn’t in Nigeria, is negotiating his own guilt over Sekovia and, after a lifetime of rebellion, is thinking it might be time to let someone else make the tough choices. Steve, who has been accustomed to siding with the government, sees how this could go terribly wrong. When another tragedy strikes and Steve’s old friend Bucky Barnes/the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) is the key suspect, the only way for Cap to keep his pal alive and find out what’s really going on is for him to go rogue. Tony and some of the other Avengers are afraid Steve will get himself killed, while another set of Avengers agree with the Captain. A few extra superheroes join the fray for good measure. The stakes keep climbing, though one of the high points of CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR is a fight among friends who are simply trying to contain one another rather than do real harm – it’s an intentional hoot that also addresses a multitude of those matchup questions (who’d win if Iron Man fought Captain America, etc., etc.). Still, that whole who-is-going-to-wind-up-versus-whom issue requires some obvious labor; we can see the wheels turning with a little too much effort to get some of the challengers into position. What will be intriguing to some and annoying to others is that the movie is genuinely interested in its topic. CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR is something like a fantasy version of EYE IN THE SKY, with people who have real power debating issues that are the fantasy equivalent of drone strikes – who should get to call them and when, if ever, and under what circumstances are they justifiable? Do the agents of force know their own strength and are they the best judges of when to use it? Unfortunately for those of us who are invested in the Talmudic discussion (ass-kicking included), the film has to shift some gears to get to the climax it wants, so that the resolution winds up hinging on a different type of moral matter. It seems there might also be more to be made of Steve and Tony winding up not only on different sides from one another, but taking positions counter to their personal norms. Then again, there’s only so much that can be fit into the 146-minute running time. Standouts in the sizable cast are Evans, a thoughtful Downey and a charismatic Chadwick Boseman as an African prince who has his own superhero identity. The action is usually inventive and impressive, though the most startling and awe-inspiring special effect is somehow getting Downey to appear to be in his teens for an extended fantasy flashback sequence. CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR expects a certain amount of familiarity with the Marvel Comics Universe mythos. If someone happens to wander in off the street, they’ll still be able to follow what’s going on, but it helps to come in caring about these people. The movie does wander off-topic just a bit at moments, but for the most part, this is a superhero epic with something real on its mind and the chops to present it well."
"Oct 31, 2018",positive," It's a long-standing convention in comics to pit superheroes against each other. It's possibly the only thing more exciting than sending a superhero off to battle the latest megalomanical villain bent on world domination. But it can also be a highly problematic narrative device if it's not handled properly. When a hero goes after the bad guy, there tends to be a clear-cut reason why. Save the world, save a friend, save the whales, whatever is most convenient. When heroes square off against each other, though, there better be a damn good reason for it, because there guys are all supposed to be fighting on the same side. That's the heart of Captain America: Civil War, the 13th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and one that not only offers hero-on-hero combat of the best possible kind but also gives a compelling reason why that combat should happen in the first place. Taking place a year after the events of Age Of Ultron, Captain America (Chris Evans) and the Avengers have been brought to task for the collateral damage they've caused in their previous exploits, including an opening set piece in Lagos that results in the side of a populated building being blown to smithereens. The United Nations calls on the Avengers to sign an accord limiting their authority and removing their ability to act unilaterally; they would only act when sanction by an international oversight committee. Cap is against the idea, believing it to be a hindrance to doing what's right instead of what's politically expedient, while Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) believes it's necessary to prevent more collateral damage. When events involving a person from Cap's past result in more casualties, Cap and his allies go rogue in an effort to find out who's behind things while also trying to evade Tony and his team, who have been ordered to arrest them for going vigilante. That basic plot description, though, doesn't truly begin to plumb the depth of the complex web of emotions and motivations that drive the film and drive allies against each other in the most dramatic of ways. Much like Capitan America: The Winter Soldier was much a political thriller as it was a traditional superhero film, so too is Civil War much more than just a 147-minute men-in-tights slugfest. It's an examination of not only the myth of the superhero, but how or even if a superhero should operate on the same level and under the same rules as non-powered humanity. Boasting the same creative team as the previous two Captain America films — directors Anthony and Joe Russo; screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely — Civil War is an assured, confident conclusion to a trilogy that builds organically upon its established elements.  A large part of what makes the film work so well is the dedication of its players, nearly all of whom seem to fully inhabit their roles. Chris Evans perfectly embodies the Captain's unflinching devotion to the greater good, while Robert Downey, Jr., is still the sarcastic, egocentric flip-side of that same devotion. Both men play the characters as more subdued this time, with Downey, Jr., even bringing new and exciting facets to Stark's character that were only ever previously hinted at. The supporting cast of the film is so large that this almost feels like a third Avengers film, but none of the characters seem extraneous, and each one contributes to the tangled mass of humanity that makes up the film's core conceit. Of the other heroes, it's the women who seem to be doing some of the heaviest lifting. Scarlett Johansson once again beautifully underplays Natasha Romonoff/Black Widow as someone always looking for a new angle and new opportunity.  Even more impressive is Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch, one of the most damaged and vulnerable heroes, but also potentially the most powerful member of the cast. She's the only hero with inherent superpowers that defy basic scientific laws, and because of that, she's more a subject of fear and derision than any of the other Avengers, a fear that she's deeply internalized. (Just don't call her a mutant unless you want to hear from 20th Century Fox's lawyers.) When she comes into her own during the climatic battle, however, it's exciting to behold. After she telekinetically separates a dueling Black Widow and Hakweye (Jeremy Renner), she calmly reprimands Hawkeye with “You're pulling your punches” in a way that's almost terrifying in its complete lack of emotion. Of course, what would a Marvel film be if we didn't introduce a couple new heroes, and thanks to the trailers there aren't any surprises as to who those are. The first is Black Panther, played with savage grace by Chadwick Boseman. One of Marvel's oldest heroes, and one of the few African heroes to grace superhero films, Panther is a potent mix of nobility and primal energy. His calm, almost stoic public identity is a sharp contrast to the furious, no-holds-barred warrior he becomes while in his indestructible super-suit. The other new addition is a little-known hero called Spider-Man, here played by Tom Holland. While Sony has rightly been criticized for rebooting Spider-Man for the third time since 2002 — and for giving us yet another iteration of Peter Parker instead of someone like Miles Morales — at least they hired an actor who fully connects with the giddy, whiz-bang attitude the web-slinger is supposed to have. For the first time, a teen-aged Peter Parker is played by an actual teenager, and Holland perfectly captures both the geeky, egghead side of Peter Parker as well as the “wow! cool!” side of a kid suddenly getting to fight alongside the world's biggest heroes. Characters aside, a film like this largely lives or dies by its action sequences. After all, that's the main hook of the whole thing. It was the be-all and end-all of this year's Batman V. Superman, but while that film seemed intent to lean solely on a couple of growling comic book titans punching each other repeatedly for two-and-a-half joyless hours, the fights in Civil War often come close to pure comic book excitement. (And unlike that film, the screen is full of actual colors and plenty of light.) The team-on-team face-off that makes up the end of the second act is a sprawling, epic smackdown that never feels too long or too confusing and grabs hold of the audience's attention right from the start. All the fights in the film are well-choreographed, and each hero is given a very specific style and move set, from Black Widow's brutal lucha-libre leg holds to Black Panther's wire-fu leaps and spin kicks. If anything else, the mere fact that a fight with this many diverse combatants could be staged at all is impressive in and of itself.  Sadly, when the film steps away from the fights and away from the Team Cap/Team Iron Man conflict driving them, things do tend to slow down significantly. There's an actual villain beyond any of the heroes, but he's thinly-drawn and remarkable shallow, with the actor playing him giving a flat performance that doesn't even try to add any depth. Instead of focusing completely on the pro- and anti-authority sides of the intra-Avengers conflict, the film tries to marry that story to a different plot thread featuring a different threat, and it doesn't always work well. That also means that after the huge, second-act team battle, any fights afterward seem that much more less exciting, no matter how well-staged they are. Likewise, it takes a while to get to the point where the Avengers have no choice but to fight each other, and the first-act lead-up to that is uncharacteristically rough and slightly unfocused, sometimes bouncing from scene to scene with the same jarring transitions that marred Batman V Superman. Once the seeds of the team conflict are planted, the film finds a perfect pace and balance, but the lead-up is certainly a bit of a bumpy ride.  The film's other setback is one it also shares with Batman V Superman in that it can be a tad impenetrable to people outside the comic book fandom. While there aren't quite as many easter eggs or fanservice moments, the film does assume that you've kept up with the Marvel Cinematic Universe since the first Iron Man (although it doesn't really reference anything in any of the Hulk or Thor solo films). While the fight scenes and set-pieces are certainly enjoyable regardless, a lot of the character drama and narrative heart of the film is lost if you aren't invested in the characters. Given the MCU's massive reach and popularity, it may seem like an odd criticism, but it's still warranted at least a little bit. The Scarlet Witch's personal story arc in particular loses a lot of heft if you haven't seen her previous appearances, for instance. Even with these criticisms, it's hard not to be thrilled and captivated by Civil War, a film that continues Marvel's history of not only making exciting, enjoyable films, but also ones that ask deeper questions and explore themes beyond fisticuffs. The heroes in Marvel films are, with perhaps one or two exceptions, real human beings with real human motivations. It's telling that aside from the Captain himself and the Vision (Paul Bettany), the characters are almost never referred to by their code names but by their actual names. When the Avengers try to find their place in the world, it's something many of us can sympathize with because they face recognizable problems, even if they face those problems with extraordinary abilities. A scene where the Captain tries to keep a helicopter from taking off with his bare hands is not only visually captivating because of Chris Evans' straining every bulging muscle in his pumped-up body. It also contains a surprising amount of honestly-won drama and empathy not only built up over the course of the film itself but over years of careful world-bulding and character development. Marvel has proven time and again that it's possible to make a film that's not only as exciting and fantastical as any comic book, but also as down-to-earth and compelling as any character drama, and Civil War is certainly no exception. “I’m just like any modern woman trying to have it all. Loving husband, a family. It’s just, I wish I had more time to seek out the dark forces and join their hellish crusade.”"
"Sep 5, 2018",positive,It manages to capture the super hero team as its only ever been done in animated series. It's next to impossible to get this kind of emotional connectedness in a few hours.

"Aug 27, 2018",positive," Those of us who have been complaining that the stakes in superhero movies have gotten ridiculously high, that it’s always the end of the world, will be relieved that Captain America: Civil War brings things back down to Earth. There are no aliens, no artificial intelligences, no angry gods or malignant outside forces. Directed by Joe and Anthony Russo, Civil War opens with a gorgeously choreographed set piece that ties off one of several dangling threads from Winter Soldier (2014), the second installment in Marvel’s Captain America franchise. Working gloriously as a team, the Avengers solve the immediate problem but create another: An explosion kills people in a nearby building. Combine that with the grieving mother who confronts Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), and the movie’s point seems clear: All that collateral damage you’ve been complaining about in Age of Ultron and Man of Steel and the like? It has to stop. But should this team control itself or, instead, be placed under outside supervision? Stark, offered an external way to put his arrogance in check, basically says: Yes, please, stop me from hurting anyone else and keep my friends from getting hurt. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), for reasons also involving his friends, disagrees. The team splits, and they cause a lot more collateral damage fighting about it — you get the picture. Except the oversight argument isn’t really the point. (If it were, there would be some gesture toward a serious argument about the good the Avengers have done.) Civil War nods to its political parallels, but then focuses on the way ego, fear and love drive a person’s choices. The divide between Tony Stark and Steve Rogers turns the movie into a sort of Rorschach test: Do you side with cocky, troubled Stark, who can’t express his emotions but is burning up with PTSD and guilt? Or with Rogers, who doesn’t trust the authorities after what happened in the previous movie that bore his name? Personally, I’m for Team Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen). With Thor and Hulk absent, this reformed baddie is easily the most powerful human on the team, and the movie doesn’t know what to do with her — an unfortunately apt statement on women in the Marvel Cinematic Universe in general (a few good Black Widow moments notwithstanding). Tony puts Wanda under house arrest with Vision (Paul Bettany), whose crush on her makes the entire situation extra creepy; she gets another pep talk from Clint (Jeremy Renner), but mostly she’s there as an object of the disagreement. However accidentally, Wanda killed people in this new, enlightened world, and must do the time for all of them. Civil War is essentially a nasty disagreement among friends that degenerates into a powered-up slap fight. (One of the filmmakers’ best choices is to have the fights collapse along with the arguments; the last blow-up has nothing of the opening sequence’s grace.) At least these superfriends can still crack a joke (I’ve never been more grateful for Anthony Mackie’s light touch) and, for all its seriousness, Civil War sustains a much-needed sense of humor."
"Aug 27, 2018",positive,Most of the film's pleasures come from dorky pipsqueak Tom Holland taking up the mantle of Spider-Man and joining the fight between Avengers factions.
"Aug 23, 2018",positive,"With swift pacing, a generally well-rounded story, and fantastic action sequences, ""Civil War"" is not to be missed."
"Aug 22, 2018",positive," One of my biggest concerns about superhero movies is that the main characters zip around, crashing and bashing bad guys, and leave a trail of collateral damage and decimated cities in their wake. No one seems to address that…until now. In fact, taking responsibility for the casualties is the very essence of Captain America – Civil War, and the humanity in that is what makes this film one of the best Marvel Comic movies yet. Since Steve Rogers/Captain America (chisel-profiled Chris Evans) is a WWII hero, we expect more good old-fashioned values from him and less tech, which makes his clash with Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) all the more interesting. Here it seems the world powers-that-be are concerned about the heroes taking justice into their own hands without being held accountable for the lives and property lost in the process. So this league of nations has come up with a pact to regulate and oversee the superheroes’ actions. At that point, it becomes all about those Marvels who wish to submit to the pact, versus those who don’t. And if you don’t already know who’s on which side, I’m not going to tell you, because half the fun is seeing how the heroes align. Also great fun is the recruitment of other superheroes from the Marvel universe to bolster each side. Even Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) joins the fray, as does Spiderman (Tom Holland). I can just imagine the legal finagling it took to borrow the webbed wonder from Sony, which owns that particular franchise. Many characters are back from Avengers: Age of Ultron and the previous two Captain America flicks, so if you want to be on top of things, you might want to take a few minutes to quickly review those films. Or at least look up Vision, Winter Soldier and Scarlet Witch. Even if you don’t, you’ll catch on soon enough, and still have a rollicking good time. This is one for the whole family, and even worth the extra investment to see it in IMAX 3D. Yes, you will flinch as Captain America throws his mighty shield. And while you might find some of the scenes a bit stretched out (the film is almost two-and-a-half-hours long), you’ll certainly get your money’s worth.

"Aug 22, 2018",neutral," The newest superhero movie, ""Batman v Superman"" — um, I mean ""Captain America: Civil War"" — is truly just a duplicate plot with different faces. This begs the question: Are DC (Detective Comics) and Marvel writers actually friends? Do they hang out and pitch ideas to one another? One would think so after seeing both of these rather dull comic book representations. There is, however, a difference with ""Captain America: Civil War"" — the film has a dizzying number of superheroes to keep track of and include in the story line. Clocking in at two hours and 26 monotonous minutes, it seems the end never will be in sight, bombarded by nonstop, nauseating, hand-to-hand combat and 3D special effects. ""Captain America: Civil War"" finds an ethical barrier to crime fighting and protecting the world. As the Avengers band together to ""get the bad guy,"" an errant fireball tossed by Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) kills hundreds of people. Well, it seems that this isn't the first time these crime fighters have killed a few dozen innocent people in their attempts to protect the world from evil-doers. Now, the United Nations feels compelled to put their foot down and reign in this out of control group. Captain America (Chris Evans) wants nothing to do with being told who to kill and who to save, but Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) sees the logic. The two part ways with their minions scurrying behind them, until the two teams are pitted against one another. (Sound familiar? See ""Batman v Superman"" review.) From the opening scene, there is nonstop action. It's not high-intensity action, though. It's slow-motion, frame-by-frame action that creates a visually disturbing blur of images. The feeling is similar to stop-motion. As you watch the fighting, it sometimes becomes confusing as to who's fighting for whom and why, unless you are an avid fan. Doom and gloom is the dramatic and repetitious story line and, unfortunately, there is very little levity in the dialogue. The writers address the absence of Thor and the Incredible Hulk, giving them an acceptable excuse for not being a part of this film. And for all you Scarlett Johansson fans, you won't be disappointed. As the minutes tick by, it isn't until Ant Man (Paul Rudd) and the new Spider Man (Tom Holland) enter the scene with some snappy dialogue that wakes you up. Overall, the lack of ingenuity makes for a lackluster story in need of major content editing. This film is definitely geared toward the comic book fans. The cinematography, although creating discomfort, gives the feeling of the graphic artwork coming to life. The precision editing creates action and combat scenes that are out of this world. Pairing this with spectacular stunts and meticulous choreography will catapult graphic novel fans into stratospheric happiness. The special effects also are quite mesmerizing as you witness the hyper-lapsing metamorphosis of Iron Man's body armor or a teen Tony Stark, and the zipping and whirring of flying objects. It's no secret that, in general, I am not a comic book film fan, with a few exceptions. Conceding this, my guess is that ""Captain America: Civil War"" will entertain fans of the Marvel Universe. There's plenty of action, many of your favorite heroes, special effects and innumerable fight scenes. Fans, go see it. The rest of us can find better things to do with our time and money."

I have never been a huge fan of superhero flicks, but I was pleasantly proven wrong. The film is actually quite funny (tons of inside jokes for the comic book devotees) charming and heartfelt in many places. The other places, well, mega destruction and over-the-top action rules. Are there tons of characters and subplots? “Game of Thrones” is easier to follow. Captain America leads the newly formed team of Avengers to continue to safeguard the world. But because of the collateral damage the team has caused, problems ensue. The new reality splits this tight knit team ergo the “Civil War.” And even though it’s called “Captain America,” this is really another “Iron Man” movie/”Avengers” film in Marvel clothing. It also introduces the new “Spider Man” just enough to make us want an actual “Spider Man” movie after five installments in this generation. But the directors Anthony and Joe Russo ably weave it all into an appealing, never boring movie escapism experience. The cast is terrific, helped by a quippy script written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. Led by the always reliable and likable Robert Downey Jr, as Iron Man, Chris Evans as Captain America, Scarlett Johannson as Black Widow, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye, Paul Rudd as Antman, Sebastian Stan as Winter Soldier, Paul Bettany as Vision, Don Cheadle as War Machine, Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther, the substantially talented ensemble all do their characters proud. Standing out of the crowd is the luminous Elizabeth Olsen as the Scarlet Witch, as well as the new Spider Man, the off the charts adorable and funny Tom Holland. The filmmakers also cast the smaller roles wisely, including William Hurt, Martin Freeman, John Slattery, Hope Davis, Marisa Tomei and a menacing Daniel Bruhl. At a running time of 2 hrs. and 26 minutes, I wasn’t bored a second. Yes, Stan Lee makes his requisite appearance, and stick around till after the credits for a clever “Spider Man” peak into the future preview. So do go see it. Marvel movies are way too charming and popcorn fun to resist."
"Jun 13, 2018",positive," First and foremost lemme talk my shit right now. Lemme talk that shit on Captain America: Civil War. Y’all out here talkin’ ’bout Batman has the best movies. Fuck Bruce Wayne. The silver screen game is Steve Rogers’ right now. The silver screen game is red, white, and blue. Steve Rogers out here giving y’all hits. Giving y’all more cameos than a Wu-Tang album. Y’all bout to give Steve “The Super Soldier Serum” Rogers the respeck on his name. Off the strength, I’ma tell you like it is. Captain America: Civil War is the best comic book adaptation of a major comic book event. I ain’t stutter, Civil War was the comic book event that separated Marvel from the pack and flexed how innovative they still were. The translation from page to big screen is of course different as the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has subtle differences making it an alternative to the Marvel-616 Universe. In Marvel-616, Civil War started when a school was blown up during a fight between teen heroes (New Warriors) and some villains. In the MCU, the event that initiates the divide within the team actually occurs over seas where their help only makes things worse. The United Nations steps in to put The Avengers in check. Bringing an argument based on a real issue — should superheroes be registered agents of the government, thereby being sanctioned and told where to go? Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) believes so adamantly. Captain America (Chris Evans) does not, as governments usually have their own agendas and what they deem as right may not necessarily be the right thing. The crisis overseas is what gets Wakanda involved in this drive towards registration. We are introduced to T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman). This guy is as smooth as T’Challa, man. The homie is confident, smooth, has the expected generic “I’m from a non-specific African country” accent but his demeanor with it so trill. Boseman represents T’Challa perfectly as the man blessed by Bast himself, The Black Panther. I don’t want to spoil how The Winter Soldier (Sebastian) comes into play but just know it makes perfect sense, and is a deviation from the comic book that you won’t mind. It further adds to the Avengers story line. Captain America: Civil War focuses on the approach of superheroes to what’s right and what’s wrong. This movie makes you pick a side because both have very valid points. Chris Evans and RDJ do incredible jobs of representing the friendship between Captain America and Iron Man as well as the frustrations between the two. Steve is a man from the past holding fast to morals and not willing to compromise them when the right thing to do is so blatantly clear. Tony Stark is a futurist that’s always adapting with the time and playing the political game in order to keep things together. You really feel for both of these characters. If you’ve been privy to the movies before hand you feel it even more as it’s been a long road headed toward this divide. Now we got the plot going down, emotions are high. Can we just talk about the action though? My god, I said good Gawd. How many movies is Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) going to have to steal the scene in, fight wise, before Marvel blesses us with a movie of her own? Black Widow is in the streets doing the most yet again, as to be expected. We see a lot of team work between Captain America and Bucky which is a throwback to the last Captain America movie and their friendship, (that’s for all y’all that said it was a weak movie. It was a set up, damn it!). Plus we got Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) taking charge, Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) bringing in the humor and showing us some new tricks. and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) with his much needed cynicism. There also Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) who comes out as the rookie of the year. Over on Stark’s side he brought the heaviest hitter of them all along in War Machine (Don Cheadle), along with The Vision (Paul Bettany), and who am I forgetting? Hmm, oh yeah Spider- God- Damn- Man (Tom Holland). Lemme tell y’all something: Tom Holland is Peter Parker. I don’t think y’all hear me, I said Tom Holland is Peter Parker. The voice, the mannerisms, the jokes, the movement, the reactions, everything. This kid will remind you of the Spider-Man cartoon and he sounds just how you would imagine teen Peter Parker to sound. Spider-Man gets worked in fast but you gotta thank Marvel for introducing him off the strength of his name on some, “Y’all already know who the fuck he is. Let’s get to the webs on webs on webs already.” The way the teams interact with one another and against one another is my favorite part of this film. Anthony Mackie really shines as Sam Wilson the loyal friend and thrower of all the snark. When you see him interact with T’Challa and Winter Soldier, you’re going to instantly be reminded of the friend you have that acts just like Sam Wilson. Now I could tell you how Baron Zemo (Daniel Brühl) plays his role very calculated in this movie but it’s best if I don’t. Brühl does an incredible job of keeping the audience guessing his intentions and displaying his calculated methods. I really have to say again, this is the best comic book adaptation to film in the game. You can complain (I know I would) about things changed but it truly makes sense for this film. Civil War really outdid Captain America: Winter Soldier (but it’s still a strong film). You wonder how they are going to top this one? Aye, man. It’s fucking Marvel cinema baby, you know they’re going to do it justice. I’mma leave y’all with this little hint about the movie. Get comfortable waiting for the post credit scenes, ’cause you gonna get hit with the most delicious two-piece. Marvel just needs to give the Russo brothers a lifetime contract, this movie had so much hype and it exceeded all expectations. Everyone was on they A+ plus game, this movie was epic!!!!"

"Feb 7, 2018",positive," Eight years ago, the arrival of Iron Man in theaters kick-started both Marvel Studios’ cinematic universe and four years of heated debate regarding the likelihood of Marvel — or any studio, for that matter — pulling off the sort of ambitious, interconnected movie plan the studio had envisioned for its films. In the years (and films) that followed, Marvel not only proved skeptics wrong, but also managed to change the conversation around its films. These days, it’s no longer a question of whether Marvel can pull it off, but how long the studio can keep their wildly successful franchise rolling along. If there’s an answer to be found in Captain America: Civil War, the latest film in the studio’s cinematic universe and the 13th movie overall, it’s that the Marvel movie train isn’t showing any signs of slowing down any time soon. Written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely and directed by brothers Joe and Anthony Russo (the same teams responsible for 2014’s Captain America: The Winter Soldier), Captain America: Civil War has Marvel’s superheroes dealing with the ramifications of their actions throughout all of the previous films and facing the deadly toll that their super-powered battles take on the innocent people around them. The Avengers soon find their loyalties fractured when the world demands that the team answer to government agencies, and the divide grows even greater when a terrorist attack implicates Captain America’s old friend, James “Bucky” Barnes — the former assassin known as The Winter Soldier. It almost seems disingenuous to frame Civil War as part of the Captain America solo franchise. More so than any of the previous films in Marvel’s movie-verse, Civil War is an ensemble piece, jam-packed with just about every costumed character introduced in the studio’s universe so far (with the exception of Chris Hemsworth’s Thor and Mark Ruffalo’s Hulk) and masterfully balancing out their screen time so no one feels neglected. Sure, the philosophical war at the heart of Civil War is primarily waged between Chris Evans’ soldier-turned-superhero, Steve Rogers (a.k.a. Captain America), and Robert Downey Jr.’s playboy industrialist, Tony Stark (Iron Man), but nearly everyone seems to have their own, unique perspective on both what’s at stake and the best way to handle it. To its credit, there’s actually a surprising amount of depth in the supporting characters of Civil War, and what could easily have been a film in which characters get smashed together under weak pretenses (a la Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice) ends up being a remarkably nuanced presentation of some complicated perspectives on personal accountability, collateral damage, and the balance between freedom and security. Both Evans and Downey articulate their  positions well — possibly even better than their characters did in the Civil War comic book series that inspired the film — and most of the supporting characters who ally themselves with one hero or the other offer up some convincing arguments for doing so. Each of the primary “team-up” films in Marvel’s cinematic universe so far have raised the bar when it comes to ensemble action sequences, from the novelty of seeing them interact in The Avengers to the impressive coordination of their efforts in films like The Winter Soldier and last year’s Avengers: Age of Ultron. The same holds true for Civil War, which boasts some of the best, visually thrilling chase- and fight-sequences of any film produced by Marvel so far. Where Age of Ultron upped the ante when it came to the scale of the ensemble sequences and how much cooperative choreography it asked of its hero characters, Civil War takes things to the next level by relying on scenes in which the characters battle each other instead of hordes of digitally created robot villains. Given the characters’ powers, those battles unfold in the air and on the ground (and occasionally at a miniature level), frequently shifting between both environments on the fly (pun totally intended) and transitioning certain match-ups from the background to the foreground as the characters trade off opponents. The end result is a wildly entertaining celebration of both hyper-detailed fight choreography and the creative team’s deep understanding of the characters and the unique ways each character moves and acts. Among the returning cast for the film are the aforementioned Evans and Downey, as well as much of the cast from both Age of Ultron and The Winter Soldier. Paul Rudd’s Ant-Man character, Scott Lang, is also thrown into the mix. While that’s all well and good (and Rudd is particularly good in the role he plays), it’s the newcomers to the franchise that have been generating the lion’s share of buzz leading up to the film’s release — and they more than live up to the hype. In his debut as the new Spider-Man, actor Tom Holland hits all the right notes, and plays off Downey and the rest of the cast well. Tonally, he captures the best parts of former Spider-Man actor Andrew Garfield’s under-appreciated portrayal of the character, offering an endless commentary on everything happening around him and bringing a light-hearted tone to the scenes he appears in. The transition into Marvel’s cinematic universe appears to have been a smooth one for the famous webslinger, and his surprisingly ample amount of screen time should leave fans feeling good about his future at Marvel. There’s also a lot to like about 42 actor Chadwick Boseman’s introduction as Black Panther, the popular African superhero, over the course of Civil War. Although the title of the film suggests that it’s Captain America’s movie, Boseman’s Black Panther and Scarlett Johansson’s spy superhero Natasha Romanoff (a.k.a. Black Widow) seem positioned to be the moral centers of the narrative. Both Johansson and Boseman do a nice job of conveying their respective characters’ uncertainty about the events transpiring around them and the opposing, rigid positions taken by each side’s leader. It’s an interesting — and clever — juxtaposition, with Black Panther offering an outsider’s perspective, while Black Widow is too deeply entrenched to fully commit to either side. It’s a difference that both actors seem well aware of in their performances, and adds another layer to the story being told in the film. As the first installment in “Phase Three” of Marvel’s cinematic universe, Captain America: Civil War does an excellent job of establishing a new status quo for The Avengers and the world they inhabit, and leaves the audience craving more without relying on a cliffhanger. It’s not an easy feat, and the film succeeds where so many other projects envisioned as chapters in a larger, over-arching story fall short. At a time when the failings of Batman V. Superman seem to have opened the door once again to discussion of “superhero fatigue,” Captain America: Civil War offers a strong argument that the best is yet to come in the superhero movie genre. Zack Snyder's Rebel Moon has hit Netflix this week, and people are already making comparisons between it and other works of cinema. Like many other iconic films, this epic space opera draws a lot from director Akira Kurosawa's groundbreaking film, Seven Samurai. This tale follows a village of farmers who seek the help of the titular warriors to stop a swarm of bandits from stealing their crops. Snyder's movie takes this plot and places it within a cosmic setting, depicting a young woman who assembles fighters from across the galaxy to defend her home from the invading Motherworld. Recently, Variety released a bombshell article alleging that Marvel Studios is rethinking its plans for its ongoing Multiverse Saga following the lackluster success of its many films and TV shows. The studio is even supposedly pondering not having Kang the Conqueror be the saga's overarching villain after all since the character's actor, Jonathan Majors, is now on trial for accusations of domestic violence.

"Jan 24, 2018",positive,The new characters totally live up to their new expectations...probably the best live action Spider-Man I have ever seen.
"Dec 5, 2017",positive," Directed by Joe Russo & Anthony Russo.
Starring Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, Jeremy Renner, William Hurt, Emily VanCamp, Tom Holland, Martin Freeman, Chadwick Boseman, Daniel Brühl, Paul Bettany, Marissa Tomei, John Kani, John Slattery, Hope Davis, Frank Grillo, and Stan Lee. Captain America: Civil War isn’t perfect and may have an overstuffed narrative, but your satisfaction detector is beyond busted if you aren’t having fun with this supersized latest entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe by the time the opposing teams of Captain America and Iron Man race towards each other full speed at an airfield hangar with the sole intention of kicking each other’s asses. That’s the exact moment you can pinpoint that this movie is everything a superhero blockbuster should be and more. This movie right here is the perfect example of why everyone from young children to teenagers to adults and even old people willingly choose to spend hot summer days inside of a dark room with images being projected onto a screen. Captain America: Civil War is the ultimate Hollywood blockbuster. Taking a dozen superheroes and giving them all highlighted moments in bombastic creative action sequences isn’t the only reason I am gushing over what Anthony and Joe Russo have brought to the table (this is their follow-up to 2014’s highly excellent Captain America: The Winter Soldier), but how the teams are established and the fact that everyone has a pretty good reason for choosing whichever side they prefer. Elizabeth Olsen returns playing Scarlet Witch, and even with limited screen time she has an arc written that sees her character going somewhere. It’s a testament to their talent that the Russo Brothers went in with a clear plan of how to juggle a whopping amount of beloved heroes and heroines. The movie is chaos, but it’s controlled chaos. It is the new characters that steal Captain America: Civil War though, specifically speaking Tom Holland’s fresh rendition of Spider-Man (not only is the actor actually a teenager this time around, but Holland also excels at delivering quips mid-fight and generally being amusing while also showcasing the kid’s typical awkward personality) and Chadwick Boseman’s Black Panther, who essentially plays both sides in the growing conflict for his own personal reasons. Most importantly, the crucial reason that these characters are considered a massive success is that people will be salivating for their upcoming solo movies by the time the Civil War credits roll. Both have fully intriguing personalities to explore, while also being responsible for some of the most memorable pieces of action found within the whole movie. Not to say that Captain America: Civil War is a major success because of one scene, but it’s hard to imagine anyone not wanting to revisit that airfield spectacle; it is like someone taking your inner child’s affection for superheroes battling each other and realizing it on screen with utter perfection. Going into Captain America: Civil War, the consensus seemed to be that because the central focus of the movie would be spent exploring the conflict of Captain America and Iron Man unable to come to an agreement on how the government should oversee their actions (with some Winter Soldier drama for good measure), all of the secondary characters would be wasted afterthoughts not necessarily adding much to the plot. This is still true to some degree, but nowhere near as bad as some may have anticipated. When it comes down to it, Captain America: Civil War will be remembered for being a movie that really doesn’t solve much, but rather is just one big excuse to create as many superhero dream battles as possible. That’s not to say the movie isn’t well written (because it is and I will get to that), but that the pure satisfaction that comes from seeing a hilariously awesome sequence such as Ant-Man shrinking himself to tinker around inside Iron Man’s suit are moments that comic book and movie fans alike have dreamed of at the very inception of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. There is a villain outside of Captain America and Iron Man (I suppose that technically the one you disagree with could be viewed as an antagonist), but I actually think the less said about him is to the benefit of anyone reading this review. He knows how to pull the strings of both Captain America and Iron Man turning them against each other, but his motives are surprisingly compelling, making him more than your generic disposable Marvel villain that is hell-bent on taking over the world, (because apparently the villain 101 guidebook says that’s what you’re supposed to do). There are red herrings and much more going on then what initially appears on the surface, with Daniel Bruhl obviously being a fantastic actor, managing to make a despicable human being somewhat empathetic in a strange way. The only real problems with Captain America: Civil War come from the first hour, occasionally getting lost transitioning from scene to scene. Without spoiling too much, there’s a funeral scene towards the beginning that just kind of happens very quickly, not really leaving a lasting impression due to how sudden it arises. It’s the kind of plot point that feels like it should be explored in a more self-contained Captain America flick, not something that is essentially Avengers 2.5. The same also applies for Captain America basically getting a new girlfriend. The movie is called Captain America: Civil War, and Captain America might be the most poorly written thing about it; how is that for irony? Random plot points aside, it’s at least understandable why both Captain America and Iron Man take up the stances they choose to vehemently fight for; the core of the narrative is well written enough to the point where neither superhero is necessarily wrong. If anything, you will probably flip-flop whose side you are on a few times throughout the movie. And for everyone that can’t take a position, they still get to chew on some very interesting themes exploring the consequences of every action and whatever the reaction may be. It’s really a movie about cause and effect, but with lots and lots of explosions and people in suits using their own unique abilities to smack each other around. As a quick side note, no one character fights the same, ensuring that all of the battles feel refreshing. A lot could have went wrong with Captain America: Civil War (some actually did considering the first hour is a bit shaky, with the actual ending leaving something to be desired), but once the teams are assembled the movie falls into a groove. The action quickly becomes the most impressive we have seen in a film from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, while also trekking down some unpredictable emotional beats that fill out the extravaganza as the total blockbuster package. If we can continue to get movies as good as Captain America: Civil War, comic book adaptations are not a bubble about to burst; we’re entering a golden age where everything is firing on all cylinders."
"Nov 16, 2017",positive," With Captain America: Civil War, the Marvel mini-series that had huge ramifications across the universe finally comes to the big screen. However, it’s not quite the same as the original comic book series given that Fox owns the rights to X-Men and Fantastic Four. That said, it’s still a really awesome film. Just as in the comics, Steve Rogers’ Captain America (Chris Evans) is pitted against Tony Stark’s Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.).  Cap is backed by Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen).  Tony is joined by Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson), War Machine (Don Cheadle), Vision (Paul Bettany), and Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) following Tony Stark (Tom Holland).  Stark also has one Peter Parker up his sleeve as Spider-Man finally joins the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Stamford incident in the comics is replaced by an incident in Lagos.  The Scarlet Witch uses her telekinesis to prevent a bomb from going off.  She ends up killing hundreds of people in the process.  Unfortunately, she was unable to prevent the blast from destroying a building.  This soon leads to the United Nations passing the Sokovia Accords.  The only question is just how many Avengers will sign on and abide by the accords? Meanwhile, at a conference to ratify the accords in Vienna, someone that appears to look like Bucky Barnes lets off a bomb that kills Wakandan king T’Chaka. His son, T’Challa (Boseman), vows to kill the person responsible. Unfortunately for him, it’s the wrong person as Bucky was framed by Helmet Zero (Daniel Brühl), who used to work for Sokovian intelligence.  Some Sokovians don’t forget what happened some time prior when the Avengers faced off against Ultron. What we know during the end of the movie: Cap breaks his team out of the Raft prison and mails a phone to Tony Stark, delivered by the great Stan Lee.  Black Widow is in hiding.  Bucky goes into stasis at a facility in Wakanda.  James Rhodes is paralyzed but Tony provides him with braces that allow him to walk again.  Thor and Hulk are not in the movie as the next Thor movie is said to be taking place around the same time and mostly in the cosmos. That being said, the events of this movie will impact the Marvel Cinematic Universe for years to come. There are a lot of players in Captain America: Civil War but it never really feels like it’s too crowded. It’s just crowded enough to be an enjoyable film.

"Nov 5, 2017",positive," Well, kids. With the release of CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR, we’re officially soaking in the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s “Phase Three” – and boy do directors Joe and Anthony Russo open the third block of superhero films in a killer, kick-ass fashion. Just like their previous film, CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER, the brothers give ethical conflicts just as much pathos as the calibrated action. While it’s immensely entertaining and has a biting sense of humor to boot, the film feels more like an AVENGERS series film than a stand-alone Cap pic. The spoiler-free plot: Our favorite band of tight-knit heroes is divided over the “Sokovia Accords,” a peace treaty/ government action that puts the Avengers under the command of all nations. Half the squad sides with Iron Man/ Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) in begrudgingly accepting the new checks on their considerable power. #TeamIronMan includes James Rhodes/ War Machine (Don Cheadle), Vision (Paul Bettany) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). The other half, led by Captain America/ Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), is determined to retain the group’s independence. Those #TeamCap dissenters include Sam Wilson/ Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Wanda Maximoff/ Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Clint Barton/ Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). The latter group is forced to go rogue to combat an emerging threat brought on by Cap’s bestie Bucky Barnes/ The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) and a mysterious baddie (Daniel Brühl). It’s sort of funny that CIVIL WAR is the second film this year about the fallout caused by the collateral damage from superhero battles (after BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE). The Marvel entry is far better, but still. It’s almost as if DC and Marvel both read the same nerd-blogger ‘think piece’ and decided to address said moral/ ethical conundrums. However, this is a conceit forged from the comics. The ship, er, helicarrier has been headed in that direction the entire time. 






Unlike the prior AVENGERS film we saw last Summer, new characters and their backgrounds are worked in far more effortlessly than ULTRON’s ham-handed, kitchen sink approach. There are no tangential storylines or overarching lore (like those stupid infinity stones) clumsily shoe-horned into the narrative. That’s not to say there’s not a lot going on. There is, and it can be a wee bit difficult to track it all. We get to take our time with (meow!) T’Challa/ Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Peter Parker/ Spider-Man’s (Tom Holland) introductions. Panther’s arc got me revved up to see what his stand-alone film will entail. This Spider-Man is guaranteed to wash out the bad taste in your mouth from THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN series. Baddie Bruhl proves to be a formidable foe. Even in a smaller role, Crossbones (Frank Grillo) impresses. Plus it’s wonderful to see another strong female character further develop her own voice – in this case, Sharon Carter (Emily Van Camp). Perhaps the best, most memorable part of the film comes late in the second act – and it’s where the movie really takes flight. Marvel superfan or not, I dare you not to have a slap-happy look on your face during the abandoned airport sequence where all the superheroes, whose dividing line is literally scorched into the Earth (earning an “oh, honey” for non-subtlety), face off against each other. It’s the best use of well-established characters blending with the new crew and it’s freaking awesome. The Russos capture the mounting action, character development and humor in a coherent way particularly well here. Otherwise, the chase through the marketplace looks like BOURNE generic shakey-cam, as does the hyper-cranked quality in the almost Hitchcockian-inspired, parkour-infused “reverse RAID” sequence with Cap in Bucky’s Bucharest hovel. It might be too soon to tell, but I think Marvel’s third phase has already corrected itself on using death and reincarnation as dramatic devices. It seems to break the rules to make up new ones – and I’m more than okay with a little shake-up of their formula."
"Oct 24, 2017",negative," Two years ago, Anthony and Joe Russo were responsible for what – for my money – is one of the best superhero films ever made.  Captain America: The Winter Soldier was a five-star delight from beginning to end, with a clever script, a neat line in repartee and a near-perfect mix of old-fashioned stunt work and seamless-looking CGI. Captain America: Civil War is very much a sequel to Winter Soldier but, regrettably, too long, tryingly complicated and it takes the best part of 75 minutes before it breaks into anything resembling comic exuberance. Apparently, she and Tony Stark – aka Iron Man – are currently on a break, a fact that reduces the potential for sexual undercurrents by about 90 per cent, despite the presence of both Scarlett Johansson – back as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow – and Emily VanCamp. After a heavy hint that the Winter Soldier is still alive, we catch up with Chris Evans as Steve Rogers, the once cryogenically suspended Captain America, plus a hefty slice of the Avengers’ gang, as they battle a terrorist attack on a bio-research lab in Lagos. Of course – after a lengthy and moderately spectacular battle – they prevail, but in the process are accidentally responsible for a great many innocent deaths.  Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross – played with sinister relish by William Hurt – believes the Avengers have gone from being guardians of the world to vigilantes. He wants them under the control of the UN, which becomes a lot more complicated after a special session of the UN, in Vienna, is devastated by a huge explosion. CCTV captures a grainy picture of the man responsible. Yes, it seems the Winter Soldier – who those paying attention will know was once Rogers’ former wartime buddy, Bucky Barnes, until Hydra got their deadly hands on him – really is alive. That being that the Avengers disagree on whether they should be under UN control. Iron Man – perhaps aware of what a mess he made of things in Avengers: Age Of Ultron – thinks they should. Which is why it’s such a relief when Stark jets off to Queens to find a teenage Peter Parker (Spider-Man graces an Avengers film for the first time, oh the excitement) and the Captain recruits arguably the silliest character in the Marvel universe, the pint-sized Ant-Man (Paul Rudd).  Captain America was created in 1940 by artists Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, who wanted to encourage the US to enter WW2, He was portrayed punching Hitler on the cover of the first issue.  At last, some real comic-book fun; at last some real spectacle… until, at least, it all gets a bit super-sized and silly at an airport. One of the slightly unfair problems Civil War faces is that the Russos raised the bar so high last time that whatever follows had to disappoint.  Most of the vital humour arrives dangerously late, courtesy of the over-delayed arrival of Spidey (nicely underplayed by young Brit Tom Holland) and Ant-Man, while, in the absence of the lovely Pepper, efforts to introduce some hints of romantic and sexual tension are hampered by the fact that Johansson seems to have run out of superheroes with whom to flirt. Let’s hope the next round of Avengers films – the Infinity Wars movies are due out in 2018 and 2019 – are better than this. Son Of Saul (15) ★★★★★, which won the 2016 Oscar for Best Film in a Foreign Language, will be one of the most powerful and harrowing films you’ll see all year. Set amid the horrors of Auschwitz in 1944 and directed by the Hungarian film-maker Laszlo Nemes, it’s the story of Saul, a Hungarian Jew forced to become a member of the so-called Sonderkommando.  Its members, prisoners themselves, were forced to work for their Nazi captors for a few short months, herding new arrivals to the gas chambers, stripping them of their belongings, valuables and jewellery, and dragging away ‘the pieces’, as the dead bodies are known, before being executed themselves. Saul, who witnesses the killing, has already decided that the boy is his son – rightly or wrongly; it’s never made clear – and determines that his body will be buried according to Jewish tradition.  However, Saul, played here with an unflagging intensity by Geza Rohrig,  will not be swayed, regardless of the cost to himself or, indeed, to his doomed fellow prisoners. From the moment Saul stumbles out of a blurry background into what feels like the sharpest focus you’ve ever seen, the appalling horrors of the concentration camp are either just out of focus or just out of shot.  The multi-layered sound design by Tamas Zanyi is outstanding, too – at times, powerfully bringing to life atrocities that we can’t see; at others adding to the atmosphere of horror. Demolition (15) ★★ is a strange film about grief directed by Jean-Marc Vallée, director of Dallas Buyers Club, and starring Jake Gyllenhaal as Davis, a New York investment banker grieving for his wife who died in a car crash.  DIY SOS presenter Nick Knowles is the unexpected force behind Golden Years (12A) ★, a would-be Ealing-style comedy about an elderly Bristol couple (Bernard Hill and Virginia McKenna) who, when faced with mounting pension problems, decide to take up bank robbery and prove surprisingly successful at it. It’s a lovely idea but the execution falls short on every count, hampered by some strange casting (Hill is only 71, while McKenna is 84), some seriously misfiring comedy and a screenplay – co-written by Knowles – that suggests, on this evidence, that he should stick to the day job."
"Oct 16, 2017",positive,"Good luck picking a favorite fight, because every action scene is incredible."
"Sep 20, 2017",positive," After last year's bloated and dull Avengers: Age Of Ultron along with the fun but unessential Ant-Man, one could be forgiven for thinking the wheels were close to falling off the Marvel wagon. Well, Anthony and Joe Russo, the same guys that made 2014's Captain America: Winter Soldier one of the smartest superhero flicks are back – and they have improved on the formula. In this, the United Nations want to take over the Avengers. Too many innocent people have died in the course of them saving the day. Tony Stark aka Iron Man is all for having accountability, Steve Rogers aka Captain America sees it as a leash. The issue breaks up the band. A bit of a no-brainer to say this is better than Batman V Superman: Dawn of Yawn, but the plots are cut from similar cloth –​ aside from having two big name heroes duke it out. That is writ big here. You defeat the bad guy but did you really save the day if a building fell on top of a crowd? Not that anyone was hoping for this to fail (outside of the DC Comics crew) but considering how many characters are involved, the huge fights, plus the need to introduce Black Panther and Spider-Man, this romps along. The only character that is an odd is Paul Bettany's Vision. The bright red guy in green may work in comics - or could work with Guardians Of The Galaxy - but here? Hey Marvel, are you totally committed to the idea of Bumbly Cumberpatch's Dr Strange? It feels like an unnecessary diversion after Civil War. Really, 2017's Spider-Man film cannot arrive soon enough. If you thought he's just a cameo here, think again. You get a lot of web for your buck, plus a very smart workaround to avoid yet another origin story. Welcome, Tom Holland - possibly already the best cinema Spider-Man yet. And we have to wait until 2018 for Black Panther? Chadwick Boseman is so definite in the role, you'd think it's his third sequel. That we have to wait that long for his first solo adventure just feels mean. This could be the most serious of all Marvel's films to date. Yet - and this is where Zack Snyder may want to pay attention - it isn't without humour. Despite this being the film where the cost of heroics in ordinary lives is brought to bear on our heroes, it remembers that they are human too. It's also interesting that the fear factor here is not that it's the end of the world. To quote every mother when the kids are playing up:  If they don't behave, someone's going to get hurt. This must be a rare case of the men serving as eye-candy more than the women. And there's no more a humbling sight for the average bloke than Chris Evans in his basic grey T-shirt. There are some highly gratuitous scenes of the gun show on display, with some very blatant flexing going on in a struggle with a helicopter. Then again, if you've got them, flaunt them. But for every other guy, you may hear the dumbbells calling... Sure, choose #TeamCap or #TeamIronMan... We are firmly #TeamRusso. So far, out of 13 movies, they are the only directors that are two for two. Jon Favreau stumbled and stepped out after Iron Man 2. Joss Whedon - the king of the ensemble - fell at the hands of Ultron (and studio heads, according to him). Only the Russo brothers have knocked it out of the park twice. This is the film with everything. Great then that they are back in 2018 for Avengers Infinity War - though given how grounded Civil War is, it will be interesting to see how they manage with more fantastical fare."
"Sep 12, 2017",positive," Truth be told, we should have seen this coming. Forget the fact that in the comic book universe, Marvel had already given readers a grand Civil War event, crossing over damn near every superhero title in their brand with Captain America as the heart and soul of the conflict, pitting him against his chief rival and Avengers co-founder, Iron Man. In that vast graphic landscape, complete with seemingly endless characters, the stakes had an undeniably personal dimension: It was a battle over identity — secret identities — which, if you think about it, verges on a question of civil rights and civil liberties. As a hero, should you be forced to register with the government, placing those you hold dear at risk simply because every crackpot with a beef against you would now have access to your family and friends at any time? The books, with the full complement of characters unbroken by the corporate interests seen on the film side, also had equally fracturing concerns over mutant registration, too. In the evolving cinematic universe (and in the more-than-capable hands of directors Anthony and Joe Russo, returning after their triumphant debut with Captain America: The Winter Soldier), Marvel works under several constraints that would seem to hinder the impact of this big-screen version of the Civil War storyline. But all is not lost, because despite not having access to mutants in this realm and the decades-long history of the print narratives, the central figures remain on each side, and they are no less compelling here than in those hand-drawn frames. Captain America (Chris Evans), aka Steve Rogers, is the endearing and enduring symbol of liberty we’ve come to love. He’s a great white savior who, again due to a tragic twist of fate, became a man out of time, frozen in ice and thawed out decades in the future — a strange and quite brave new world, with technology, shadowy bureaucracies and a growing collection of villains staging a new assault on freedom and justice. Able assistance arrives in the form of Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), the son of a brilliant scientist and compatriot of Captain America’s from back in the day. But much like his father, the younger Stark proves to be a bit of a wild card. The flamboyantly wealthy playboy with the ability to create such destructive toys fashioned himself as the ultimate deterrent to war thanks to his Iron Man armor, which he believed only he should control. That is until personal guilt and greater authoritative forces convinced him that some oversight might be necessary. But who should watch over the emerging gamma-mad brutes, the alien gods, the never-miss sharpshooters, the iron men and the high-flying birds of prey? So caught up in the corporate branding of phases, developing storylines into the foreseeable future and managing multiple distribution formats, Marvel has somehow been able to maintain a strong focus on the characters and the interpersonal interactions between them in order to create a sense of camaraderie and the inevitable tension that fuels the fire in an explosive civil war. Civil War, the third installment in the ongoing saga of Steve Rogers, continues the fascinating narrative of the most fully realized character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. From his nostalgically-rendered origin and the slam-bam espionage tale in Winter Soldier to the superhero-stuffed sandwich that is Civil War, Rogers and his bedrock relationship with his best friend, Bucky (Sebastian Stan), has served as the moral compass, ever-pointing to true north. All of the old Avengers standbys are here, except Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), and there’s the embarrassment of riches with the inclusion of the new Spider-Man (Tom Holland) and Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), each of whom get more than enough opportunity to shine. But in a movie packed to the gills with heroes, Civil War never loses track of the fact that it is a Captain America story. The love, loss and life of Steve Rogers ground every scene. There is an intimacy here that does not exist in The Avengers movies."
"Aug 25, 2017",negative,"Actually, instead of Captain America: Civil War, a more appropriate title might be Captain America: Cap and Iron Man Get Their Iddy-Biddy Feewings Hurt."
"Aug 17, 2017",positive,Emotionally satisfying in a way that most other MCU movies can only dream of being.
"Aug 14, 2017",positive,"""Captain America: Civil War"" is a movie about faith - in each other, in leaders, in an ethos - in a universe that is becoming increasingly secular."
"Aug 3, 2017",positive," So says Iron Man (aka Tony Stark) in ""Captain America: Civil War,"" perhaps one of the most politically nuanced films ever released as a tentpole in a blockbuster franchise. This is a movie with a distinct social message, one that merits detailed analysis, but in order for that to happen I'll need to give away key plot points from the film. As a result, major spoilers follow this paragraph. Back to Stark: ""Captain America: Civil War"" tells the story of an international agreement known as the Sokovia Accords that requires superheroes to register with the government and operate only ""when"" and ""if"" a United Nations panel deems it necessary. Captain America (aka Steve Rogers) immediately opposes this on the grounds that it violates their civil liberties, while Iron Man supports it because he believes that (as another character puts it) ""victory at the expense of the innocent is no victory at all."" Because superheroes often cause significant loss of life and property, the argument for accountability makes a great deal of sense — indeed, it's practically self-evident. Yet by the end of ""Captain America: Civil War,"" the plot has decisively sided with Captain America and forced Iron Man to come around to his position … in this writer's opinion, incorrectly so. This isn't to say that ""Captain America: Civil War"" is a bad film. Very much to the contrary, it is one of the best movies to ever come out of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, balancing engaging action set pieces and witty dialogue with intelligent character studies and ethical debates. Due to its political content and numerous superhero characters, it invites comparison to ""Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice,"" particularly when the latter discussed how ""in a democracy good is a conversation, not a unilateral decision."" Unlike ""BvS,"" however, the new ""Captain America"" is well-written and a lot of fun, which makes it much easier to recommend to casual moviegoing audiences. It also does a commendable job of giving Iron Man's point of view a fair shake. At one point, the android Vision (who sides with Iron Man) rebuts Captain America by pointing out that ""our very strength invites challenge. Challenge incites conflict. And conflict... breeds catastrophe. Supervision is not something to be dismissed out of hand."" What's more, there is an unavoidable democratic logic to the Sokovia Accords, which is based on the premise that superheroes must be held to the same legal standards as non-superpowered human beings. There are unsettling real-world implications to arguing that ""super"" people should be allowed to change the world as they see fit without being accountable for the harm caused by their actions, even if said harm is unintentional (such as when we see Scarlet Witch accidentally blow up a building in Nigeria). When Captain America insists that ""I know we're not perfect, but the safest hands are still our own,"" he actually flies in the face of the spirit of democracy, subordinating the will of the people to a belief in his own superior virtue. Nevertheless, the movie winds up siding with him, and not only because his name is in the title. Obviously the superhero genre itself can't exist if its characters are forced to report to the government like glorified police officers, so there are practical reasons for the Marvel movies to maintain a comparatively anarchic universe. On a more profound level, though, ""Captain America: Civil War"" is the product of a culture that has been given excellent reasons to distrust state authority. Once the government gains power over superheroes, it quickly deprives them of their civil liberties, denying the arrested superheroes legal counsel, interning Scarlet Witch without trial, and ordering the assassination of a character (the Winter Soldier) whose innocence would save his life if only his civil liberties were being respected. Even when the government acts justly — such as when we see it imprison Falcon, Hawkeye, Ant Man and Scarlet Witch, all of whom are undoubtedly guilty of breaking the law -- it's still discomfiting to see this in action. We know these characters, we like them, and we recognize their good intentions, so it's painful to see them treated like criminals instead of heroes. Nevertheless, if they existed in the real world, they would be criminals, so when Iron Man switches his views after seeing them incarcerated, the change of heart seems short-sighted rather than noble. It's understandable why he would feel sympathy for his friends, of course, but by opposing government oversight simply because he feels badly for them, he forgets that just because he knows them and the audience (in a sense) knows them doesn't mean that the billions of denizens in the Marvel Cinematic Universe know them on the same personal level. They are, and remain, unelected and unaccountable — and thanks to Iron Man's assistance in helping them escape at the end, remain that way. It's worth noting that, when I saw this movie with my friends, two of us wound up getting involved in a heated debate on its political message immediately after the screening. One of them firmly sided with Captain America and the other had a decidedly mixed view on the film's political subtext, but both had deep reservations about the amount of power exercised by the state in this film. My theory is that, because our generation has seen our government violate individual liberties on a regular basis (from the war on drugs and NSA spying to law enforcement persecution of racial minorities), there is an instinctive distrust of state authority that is entirely reasonable. When my friends Adam and Jorge identify with Captain America's rhetoric on individual rights being the foundation of true justice, they're applying lessons that we have far too often seen be disregarded with terrible consequences. It is entirely possible for intelligent and well-intentioned individuals to see the world the way that Captain America does here. The regrettable thing about ""Captain America: Civil War"" is that, instead of allowing Iron Man to remain resolute in his convictions as well, it forces him to give way so that the plot can move forward. While our world doesn't have superhumans, it has many individuals who wield disproportionate power over the rest of us because of unearned privileges — wealth, or being part of an empowered racial or gender group, for example. If we are going to create a free and just world, these concentrations of social and economic power need to be confronted and remedied, and just as a Captain America must exist to remind us that their individual rights matter too, so too is an Iron Man required to remind us that the freedom of the whole is infringed when the few can make themselves unaccountable to the rest. If ""Captain America: Civil War"" had been a truly insightful movie, it would have aimed to strike a balance between both of these perspectives. By ultimately siding with Captain America over Iron Man, it implicitly delegitimizes a valid and important perspective. Matthew Rozsa is a staff writer at Salon.

"Jun 26, 2017",positive," As any Marvel’s Avengers appreciator can tell you, a staple focus of each story is on team dynamics. What does it take for a group of people with different agendas and backgrounds to effectively work together for good? How does a team find common ground, and account for each others’ strengths and weaknesses? As anyone who’s lived in Christian community (or worked in social justice) knows, these ideas come up as much in everyday life as they do when taking down a supervillain. But what Marvel hasn’t looked at is the other side of intentional community — what happens when a team can’t work. The latest Marvel release, Captain America: Civil War, digs into these important questions: What does it take to break up a team? And what does the fallout look like? Civil War ’s conflict begins when Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), a.k.a Iron Man, puts his support behind The Sokovia Accords, a document created in response to the destruction at the end of Avengers: Age of Ultron. The accords would place the Avengers under the jurisdiction of the United Nations, putting them in combat only when the U.N. deems it necessary. The Avengers who sign on will continue as part of the team. The ones who don’t will be forced into retirement. Predictably, some of the Avengers agree with Stark, believing the team’s actions shouldn’t be allowed to go unchecked. Others believe that this compromise is the only way they’ll be able to continue doing meaningful work. But a few, particularly Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), a.k.a Captain America, refuse to sign, believing the best way to do their job is by putting faith in each other, not institutions. Matters get complicated when a bomb goes off at the official signing of the accords, killing several people. Blame for the incident falls on Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), Cap’s former best friend, who’s recovering from his stint as the brainwashed human weapon, Winter Soldier. Already on Stark’s bad side, Captain America and his allies battle with Stark and the other Avengers to protect Bucky, who they believe is innocent. Fortunately, Civil War is not the same painful, nihilistic slog that this spring’s other superhero smackdown, Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice was. Unlike Zack Snyder’s debacle, Civil War directors Joe and Anthony Russo understand how to successfully portray the difference of beliefs that lead to the film’s big fight. We know why Iron Man and Captain America each feel the way they do — and, crucially, the film never positions either of them as clearly right or wrong. Of course, Civil War is also really fun. It includes incredible action sequences, and its stars have natural chemistry. The addition of two new heroes to the ranks (Chadwick Boseman’s great Black Panther and Tom Holland’s adorably dorky Spider-Man) is exciting, as is the return of Paul Rudd as the smart-mouthed, scrappy Ant-Man. But it’s the balance of conflict at its core, and the film’s willingness to expose and explore the deep-rooted feelings of its characters that makes Captain America: Civil War such a success. Just like us, Earth’s Mightiest Heroes disagree and get their feelings hurt sometimes. But, like any relationship worth saving, we know they’ll be reconciled. Whether you’re battling mass incarceration or alien invaders, fighting for the common good also means caring about the people fighting by your side. We value your feedback on the articles we post.

"Jun 1, 2017",positive," More so than any other superhero movie, Captain America: Civil War prosecutes the very men and women we're supposed to be grateful for. It demands that these heroes take a look at the devastation they've caused around the world, face their guilt and admit that their existence may be more problematic for humanity than beneficial. The movie is not a celebration of the superhero squad, but a condemnation. If The Avengers was our introduction to what the team could do to protect their home from otherworldly threats, Civil War is the chilling reminder of the devastation and calamity that also comes with it. In many ways, Civil War is Marvel's darkest and heaviest movie to date, but that's part of what makes it the studio's best. After close to a decade of watching these heroes come into their own, flying around Earth and transporting themselves to different universes, Civil War is the first truly human movie about a team of superhuman individuals. While Civil War does present an actual villain for the team to take down, the biggest battle in the movie is with each other over the level of freedom they have. It's not a question of physically taking that political freedom away, but a moral dilemma over whether they've abused their privileges and whether or not it's time to admit that they might be causing more harm than good to the very population they swore to protect. To be a superhero, things must be sacrificed. Personal relationships, a chance at a normal life or even just being able to take a vacation. Existing as an extraordinary being means giving up the ordinary aspects of life that many of us take for granted. The tradeoff for living an isolating and burden-filled life that comes with being a superhero is the protection and survival of the place they call home. When they're faced with the reality of the consequences of their actions, however, they begin to question everything they thought they knew. It's that internal struggle that eventually leads to the grand battle between themselves where the movie finds its heart. Despite the heaviness of the movie, however, the trademark humor and banter between the characters is still very much present throughout the film. Their obvious love for each other, as a family of misfits bound together by their superhuman abilities, just adds to the heartbreaking dissolution of their trust and kinship with each other. Captain America: Civil War is, without question, the best movie to come out of Marvel Studios in the past eight years, and it's hard to see how they'll top it going forward. Quasi-based on the 2006 Marvel Comics crossover event of the same name, there's a couple of different story arcs happening in Civil War. There's the continuation of Bucky Barnes' (also known as the Winter Solider) complicated relationship with former best friend, Steve Rogers aka Captain America. There's a new threat being posed to the Avengers, and in turn, the rest of humanity by an unknown villain. But the biggest storyline by far is the battle between Captain America and Iron Man over whether or not to sign the Sokovia Accord. Similar to the Superhuman Registration Act in Mark Millar's comic, the Sokovia Accord is a legally binding contract that would force the various superheroes around the world to operate as a branch of the United Nations. Instead of being able to fly into any country they like, attempting to take out dangerous men and women, they would need proper clearance from the U.N. as a ways of respecting and honoring the rules of sovereign states. On one side of the debate over whether to sign the Accord or not is Tony Stark (Iron Man), who after a particularly emotional conversation, argues that having a third-party voice give their take on a dangerous situation could be beneficial. It's a thought echoed by Vision (Paul Bettany), who preaches that in order to gain the respect and trust of normal people, they must work with the agencies that those people have elected. On the other side is Rogers, who stubbornly refuses to sign the Accord. In his opinion, having their freedom taken away from them would lead to other sections of their lives being compromised, like their right to privacy. In his opinion, signing the Accord is fundamentally wrong and, considering the tangled web his best friend Bucky is caught up in, he and Tony realize they can't agree on what the best option is for the future of their team. Civil War feels like a political thriller, full of espionage, backstabbing and above all else, rigid drama. Anthony and Joe Russo, the directors behind the film, know how to make something as dull as a team meeting over whether they should sign a contract immensely fascinating and emotionally draining. Every time these team members interact with each other, there's an enormous amount of emotion behind their conversations. While the action hasn't been sacrificed — there is an amazing chase scene that particularly stands out — it's clear that the Russo brothers don't need to rely on it. The movie marks Peter Parker's debut in the Cinematic Universe, and while the character has begun to feel played out, Tom Holland's portrayal may be the best version yet. Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield attempted to play a young, nerdy Peter Parker and while they weren't terrible in the roles, there was something inauthentic about their portrayals. Holland, on the other hand, looks and sounds like a teenager. The actor, who's 19 in real life, looks like he's in his freshman year of high school, and there's a sensitive side to his take on the character that Maguire and Garfield never fully captured. Even more importantly, however, is how great his chemistry is with Robert Downey Jr. Iron Man is the superhero that Parker most resonates with, and as a result, the two of them have the most interaction in the movie. It was crucial that the two were able to pull off the mentorship vibe that Marvel is obviously going for and they surpass all expectation. Holland's Peter Parker feels like the Spider-Man iteration that we've all been waiting for. Instead, the Russo brothers, who understand how to properly use an ensemble cast as big as the one in Civl War, use the action sequences sparingly. It's clear the focus is on the moral dilemma and ethical drama that's been brewing since the last Captain America movie, Winter Soldier, and on the growing distrust Rogers has for the government. The Captain America series has always felt like the maturest of all the Marvel properties, and Civil War is the defining moment of that maturity. As Marvel starts a new phase in its Cinematic Universe, there's a shift in tone from the films that started it all in 2008. As its fans have grown, so has the studio, and after spending nearly a decade getting to know these characters, Civil War is the near perfect result of what can be accomplished if you can create a universe that people deeply invest themselves in. This movie couldn't have worked before now, because there wasn't enough reason to care that Tony Stark and Steve Rogers were going to fight over this type of issue. We know these characters now, however, and their grievances with each other, watching them beat each other to a bloody pulp, is overwhelmingly afflicting. The Russo brothers understand how important the family dynamic is to this storyline, and they not only manage to portray that in this film, but use just enough personal banter on top of the intense drama to remind us that regardless of past arguments they've always been a strong unit. As a result, everything that happens between the superhero collective becomes more devastating. Despite all the heaviness surrounding the movie, those looking for a classic Marvel experience won't be disappointed. Especially if you're banking on seeing some pretty incredible fight choreography. It's hard to talk about just how fantastic the fight scenes in Civil War are (compared to some of the bigger parts of the Avengers movies) without giving too much away, so I'll try to remain as vague as possible for those who don't want to know too much about it. The fight scenes in Civil War are broken down into a couple of different sections. There's introductory fights (new character dislikes another character and the two fight), personal fights (Bucky taking on Steve or Tony taking on Steve, for example) and then there are the blockbuster stylized fights, which is essentially the team battles. Each type of fight has its own quirk, but you're never bored by what you're seeing on screen. Sometimes, fight choreography can get repetitive and monotonous. There's only so many ways you can punch someone in the face, after all! But the Russo brothers inject their own personality into each scene, and the fights switch from rapidly placed punches and kicks to slowed down, meticulous blows. In many ways, each sequence feels tailored made for each character, and it's an element of the movie that I particularly enjoyed. Fans of Millar's original series will also be happy to know that there are panels from the comic that make it into the film, specifically during the fight scenes. While Civil War doesn't follow Millar's book directly, there are certainly similar themes and events that present themselves throughout the movie and it's clear that the Russo brothers dug deep to find ways to honor his story as best as they could. Bettany, Downey Jr., Paul Rudd (Ant-Man), Tom Holland (Spider-Man) and Anthony Mackie (Falcon) steal the show in that regard and provide the perfect amount of comic relief for a movie this tense. The cathartic moments that appear in the movie, although few and far between considering just how much is happening, usually revolves around these characters and because of that, they are utterly crucial. The use of comedy as a major incentive to love these characters has always worked for Marvel and I was concerned going into Civil War that the comedic aspects would be sacrificed in order to tackle all the story arcs that had to be included. It's definitely there, though, and despite the movie dealing with pretty serious issues, the guilt of its characters and the questionable future ahead, it remains a fun watch. This was the Avengers movie that we were all waiting on. This feels like the ultimate ensemble superhero movie and I'm worried that the more they try to pack into two-and-a-half hours, the less we'll get out of it. If Marvel can find a way to replicate this exact formula and use it for the rest of their big flagship films, though, it's a universe I'll never get tired of. I went into Civil War expecting a run-of-the-mill Marvel movie. I left feeling more excited about the countless possibilities the studio has going forward, and that's something I didn't think I would get back after The Avengers."
"May 10, 2017",positive," I have had my feet firmly planted in “Team Cap” ever since I heard that there would be a Civil War film. The Captain America films have, by far and away, been my favourite superhero movies of recent times. They are wordy, tense, noir-like and … let’s be honest … they have Chris Evans bursting out of every t-shirt he owns. (Hey, I’m only human.) So the premise of Civil War is simple: choose a side. Team Cap or Team Iron Man. With a couple of disasters notched up, the Avengers are under intense political scrutiny. The US government wants the assembled team of Avengers to sign a bill stating that they will ultimately become accountable for their own actions. This causes division within the team. Captain America (Chris Evans) believes superheroes should remain free to defend humanity without government interference. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) sharply disagrees and supports oversight. As the debate escalates into a proper feud, the rest of the superheroes must decide where their loyalties lie. Directors the Russo brothers - the team behind Captain America: The Winter Soldier - have proved something almighty with their last two cinematic offerings. Superhero movies do not need to be dumbed down. They do not need to be action heavy to be entertaining. They can be quick-witted and dialogue heavy without feeling drawn out or glib. That’s not to say there isn’t plenty of action in this latest Marvel instalment. There is, of course, one almighty battle sequence between the two sides. But even that is peppered with one-liners, moments of confusion and some of deep thought. After all, these two sides don’t really want to be fighting each other. The undoubted star of the show is the arrival of Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman). In his suit, he prowls and leaps like his namesake and truly is a phenomenal foe for Team Cap. His back story - an African prince and superhero - is an integral part to not only this film, but his own eventual solo outing, pencilled in for 2018. In case you missed it, Spiderman is also in this film. Yes, Marvel have reclaimed him from the death-by-100-terrible-films Sony were inflicting upon him. He’s back, and he’s Team Iron Man. The interesting thing about Spiderman in this film is it’s the first time he’s ever appeared on screen exactly how he is in the graphic novels. Peter Parker (Tom Holland) is a young boy (as in, still in high school) not a twenty-something newspaper photographer. And with that age adjustment comes some genuinely funny moments. He bounds through the fight sequence, absolutely thrilled to meet everyone, and not exactly sure how to control his own Spidey-suit. There is also great humour from Ant Man’s appearance and some quirky back and forths between the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) and Falcon (Anthony Mackie). Of course, Robert Downey Jr has his usual eye-rolls and sarcasm drenched delivery. Ultimately, this is a Captain America film and is therefore definitely more dialogue driven than a bog-standard blockbuster. The one sticking point for me is the character of Baron Zemo. When it was announced that Daniel Bruhl would be playing this character in the film, Twitter exploded. Everyone was buzzing with the news that this truly stellar actor would be joining the franchise. Except … he hasn’t, really. The villain of the piece is entirely throwaway. Even the various Avengers barely bat an eyelid at the mention of his name. Without his actions, the characters would probably have developed in exactly the same way. Which, sadly, means there was ultimately very little point to his character. However, this is one of the best films Marvel have produced. It sets Spiderman up beautifully for a series of films that the character deserves. It also leaves a lot of options for where the rest of the Avengers may be headed. I would happily go and see this again."
"Apr 19, 2017",neutral," Llevamos ya algunos años únicos para los amantes de los cómics. El regreso del amor por la cultura geek nunca ha estado tan efervescente como ahora: tenemos una buena cantidad de películas de ciencia ficción que esperar, la gente se intriga de nuevo por los viajes tripulados a Marte, comprobamos la existencia de ondas gravitacionales, hemos tomado fotos inauditas de planetas enanos y se están haciendo una cantidad pasmosa de adaptaciones de cómics. Las locuras espaciales de la ciencia están emparejándose con nuestro apetito por universos imaginados en el calor colorido de las páginas de historietas. Y este alcance ya lo vimos con Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice: la pelea eterna entre la seriedad propositiva de DC y el desparpajo juvenil de Marvel ha invadido otros medios, pasando del papel a las pantallas de streaming, la televisión y las producciones masivas de Hollywood. Si algo nos enseñó la convulsa y polémica cinta de Zack Snyder fue, justamente, que en Warner Bros. están desesperados por lograr la fórmula que ha estado cultivando pacientemente Marvel. Como dije en mi reseña de The Avengers: Age of Ultron, el universo cinemático de la casa de Stan Lee está completamente construido al punto de llegar a una complejidad inaudita: conocemos una cantidad increíble de personajes de cómic encarnados para la pantalla, relacionamos seres dibujados con series y películas, podemos ver dos horas y media de acción completamente alocada sin que esto represente un riesgo sorpresivo para la corta atención de los espectadores domingueros. El mundo de Marvel está perfectamente instalado después de sus dos primeras fases. Y lo que se estrena aquí no es nada más un cierre a la saga propia del Capitán América sino el comienzo, con fuerza, de una tercera etapa que nos llevará a las peleas más incomprensiblemente cósmicas entre el universo cuántico, los delirios místicos de lo oculto y las guerras infinitas contra un titán enamorado de la muerte. Así que esta cinta es sumamente importante para la construcción del Universo Cinemático Marvel (MCU) y, aceptando el reto impuesto, los hermanos Russo nos han entregado el final digno de una saga y el principio esperanzador de un universo complejo que, a pesar de su larguísima historia en papel y sus 13 películas en pantalla, no deja de sorprendernos. Cuando supimos que el título del final de la saga de Capitán América sería Civil War, más de un fanático se quedó pasmado. ¿Cómo era posible poner un arco tan complejo y masivo en una sola cinta? Digo, por más que hicieran una película de nueve horas, sería imposible considerar todas las sub-tramas apasionantes de una serie que revolucionó el universo Marvel en el siglo XXI. Lo que no consideramos en ese momento inicial de sorpresa es que ya no es necesario hacerle honor exacto a los cómics en los que se basan estas películas. Si en un principio la fidelidad al cómic o, al menos, el respeto a los parámetros esenciales que dieron vida a los personajes, era primordial, después de ocho años en que Marvel saca una cinta cada seis meses, los distanciamientos entre el universo de papel y el de la pantalla grande comienzan a ser considerables. Es un poco como la teoría de la mariposa narrativa que tomó prestada George R. R. Martin del matemático Edward Lorenz: el aleteo de una mariposa en un lado del mundo puede producir un huracán en el otro. Así, si al principio de las adaptaciones de Game of Thrones se cambiaron algunos detalles mínimos de las novelas, después de cinco temporadas, estos detalles se convirtieron en diferencias irreconciliables. ¿Y cómo no pensar en la misma parábola para el universo Marvel? ¿Cómo podrían tener cabida todos los elementos esenciales del arco de Civil War en el MCU? De entrada, los X-Men y los Cuatro Fantásticos están fuera de la jugada por asuntos legales con Fox. Y esto no es poca cosa. En este universo no pasaron los eventos de House of M, no hubo M Day, Wolverine no anda de loco matando gente, Ororo no está casada con Black Panther y el apuesto Ben no está por ahí haciéndole sombra a la ausencia imponente del gran Hulk. Aquí tampoco figuran años de historia en los que se incluyen el matrimonio de Jessica Jones con Luke Cage, el de Peter Parker con Mary Jane, la muerte de Gwen Stacy y la sonrisa enloquecida de Norman Osborn; aquí no existen aún las personalidades intrigantes de Cloak y Dagger, ni Tigra, ni la Zona Negativa; aquí no figura la ciencia del Dr. Richards, ni la de Dr. Doom, ni la de un Hank Pym eternamente joven; aquí no encontramos a jóvenes Avengers, ni a otros héroes canadienses, ni los complejísimos problemas de diplomacia galáctica con los Inhumans. Así que la adaptación de Civil War tenía que ser algo muy distante de una reelaboración fiel que parecía francamente imposible. Y también ya es necesario preguntarnos, ¿por qué no sería legítima una adaptación libre de un universo que es imposible trasladar, por su magnitud y temporalidad alocada, a un medio como el del cine? Respondiendo a esta pregunta con una inusitada muestra de respeto y congruencia, los guionistas de Captain America: Civil War dejaron algunos elementos esenciales de la historia original para transformarla en un evento decisivo, a su escala, en el universo fílmico de Marvel. Christopher Markus y Stephen McFeely, que iniciaron su prometedora carrera hace una década dándole nueva vida a la polémica figura de uno de los actores más intrigantes de la historia de Hollywood (The Life and Dead of Peter Sellers), se han dedicado ahora a la difícil tarea de adaptar cómics. Y en ellos recae la responsabilidad de que la saga individual de Captain America sea una de las más interesantes en el amplísimo proyecto cinematográfico de la casa de Stan Lee. Porque, desde Winter Soldier, se sentaron las bases para relacionar Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D con el MCU, se instaló la relación esencial de los Avengers con la siempre misteriosa figura de Nick Fury y se propuso una trama que jugaba muy bien con viejos traumas de Guerra Fría, las paranoias del espionaje gubernamental y los recuerdos de un héroe americano que, alguna vez, tuvo un sidekick adolescente esencial para el mundo de los cómics: Bucky Barnes. Los guionistas de Captain America: Civil War dejaron algunos elementos esenciales de la historia original para transformarla en un evento decisivo, a su escala, en el universo fílmico de Marvel. Los guionistas de Captain America: Civil War dejaron algunos elementos esenciales de la historia original para transformarla en un evento decisivo, a su escala, en el universo fílmico de Marvel. En esta cinta, la adaptación funciona con un cambio de escala: en vez de proponer una catástrofe inicial (la explosión en Stamford) para dar cabida a una reforma política puramente estadounidense (la Superhuman Registration Act) que afecta a un amplísimo universo de superhéroes (ansiosos de proteger sus identidades secretas), todo se relaciona con las anteriores catástrofes humanas que han causado las intervenciones de los Avengers en el universo fílmico (desde la batalla de Nueva York, hasta la destrucción de los helicarriers en Washington y la más reciente explosión de Lagos).  En este contexto entonces, la ley no trata de desenmascarar, registrar y volver jurídicamente responsables a los superhéroes en el territorio norteamericano, sino que se convierte en una iniciativa de la ONU para controlar, específicamente, a los Avengers. Y esto, francamente, tiene sentido: ¿por qué querrían proteger su identidad, en este universo, Steve Rogers –probablemente el héroe más famosos de la historia–, Tony Stark –el multimillonario de ostentosa vida pública–, Vision –que está encima de estas cuestiones–, Wanda Maximoff, Natasha Romanoff, Sam Wilson, Rodes o Clint Barton, cuyas identidades son más que conocidas? Así, el Superhuman Regsitration Act se convierte, más bien, en una medida mundial para restringir los movimientos específicos de los héroes que ya conocimos en las dos cintas anteriores. Este cambio de escala permite que la trama se centre en dilemas muchísimo más personales como, justamente, la relación entre Iron Man y Capitán America. Las cuestiones políticas se diluyen continuando únicamente en el trasfondo de espionaje y Guerra Fría que acarrea, como lastre eterno, el Soldado del Invierno; las relaciones entre personajes se tensan sin necesidad de ampliar el universo y los problemas de relación con el gobierno estadounidense e transforman en una diplomacia planetaria mucho más acorde a la inmediata guerra cósmica que se avecina. Todo esto funciona perfectamente como continuación de Winter Soldier y Age of Ultron, y, además, permite una introducción orgánica de dos personajes importantísimos que resultan maravillosos en pantalla: Black Panther y el nuevo Spider-Man –que, con Tom Holland, me parece la conjunción perfecta de carisma y timidez ñoña que nunca lograron Tobey Maguire ni Andrew Garfield–. Así, centrándose en intereses muy distintos a los del cómic, esta película no intenta abarcar algo más allá de sus posibilidades, no cae en la trampa de solemnizar demasiado sus pretensiones –como sí lo hizo Dawn of Justice– ni de exaltar, como principio, problemas políticos que situarían la cinta, fuera de la natural locura de Marvel en el cine, en un realismo mal emplazado. No, en esta película, los ideales se convierten en razones personales evitando explayarse en un recurso de reflexión política innecesaria. El afán de libertad a toda costa del Capitán América se convierte en recuerdo nostálgico por el único superviviente de una época para siempre perdida; la necedad reformista de Iron Man se basa en la culpa, claro, pero también en una nueva sed de venganza por el asesinato de sus padres; la integración de Spider-Man aparece, en una nueva temporalidad, como el rescate inesperado de un joven con talento torpe y trauma de ausencia paterna; los fríos cálculos de Reed Richards se trasladan a la mente conflictuada entre lógica y amor de Vision; y las demás relaciones se entretejen en la pura lealtad de Rhodes o Wilson y la sorpresa simpática de Scott Lang –que nos mostró aquí, maravillosamente, las posibilidades de un Giant-Man tan increíble como inesperado–. Todo esto funciona perfectamente como continuación de Winter Soldier y Age of Ultron, y, además, permite una introducción orgánica de dos personajes importantísimos que resultan maravillosos en pantalla: Black Panther y el nuevo Spider-Man. Todo esto funciona perfectamente como continuación de Winter Soldier y Age of Ultron, y, además, permite una introducción orgánica de dos personajes importantísimos que resultan maravillosos en pantalla: Black Panther y el nuevo Spider-Man. La dirección segura de los hermanos Russo y el guión sólido de Markus y McFeely permiten que todos estos elementos se trasladen sin exabruptos a la pantalla grande. Aquí se aprovechan todos los recursos narrativos legados por las otras cintas, se entretejen nuevas tramas y se relaciona el mundo de los cómics al de la pantalla con la esencia irrevocable de la guerra civil. Porque, en un momento, pensé que la película sería un completo fiasco y que tendríamos otro terrible caso de “te llamabas Martha”. Si Iron Man, descubriendo la trampa de Zemo –o, más bien, cayendo en ella–, hubiera llegado al complejo de Siberia para enfrentar, junto al Capitán y Bucky a un enemigo común, la cinta hubiera creado conflicto y reconciliación a lo rápido, sin fundamentos y dejándonos un sabor completamente soso (te hablan Snyder). Pero, en vez de esto, la cinta se arriesga a mantener el conflicto de la guerra civil más allá de sus dos horas y medias hacia el futuro de la franquicia. Porque así tenía que ser: los problemas de Stark con Rogers no terminan en el número siete de Civil War sino que se extienden, como ondas en un vaso de agua, mucho más allá de donde se derramó la primera gota. Porque, en efecto, en ese último diálogo entre el personaje de Martin Freeman (The Hobbit) y un excelso Daniel Brühl (Inglorious Basterds), se confirma que los planes de Zemo en realidad no fallaron: el imperio que siempre quiso derrumbar, usando más la astucia que la fuerza –como lo hace frecuentemente su contraparte de los cómics–, era el de la unión entre los superhéroes. Tal vez Rogers no mató a Stark, pero la separación se vuelve infranqueable: no hay reconciliación posible y la mitad de los Avengers se convierten, con el rescate carcelario, en fugitivos buscados por la policía internacional. Así, la completa falta de resolución al final de la cinta muestra bien los logros de una adaptación que entendió muy bien la serie original y que la transformó para cuadrarla dentro de los parámetros de su universo. Y estos parámetros funcionan a la perfección en el diálogo con películas pasadas… Y con guerras futuras. Age of Ultron, además de ser la despedida grandilocuente de Whedon, fue una introducción a las guerras cósmicas del futuro: ahí están presentes, todo el tiempo, las gemas del infinito, Thanos se asoma insidioso y el asunto acaba dando la sensación de que el plan del tiránico titán lleva un rato cocinándose (con Loki, Ronan y el coleccionista en medio). Toda la idea de esa película es que, a pesar de no tener una invasión alienígena en puerta, las cosas nunca podrán ser iguales para la Tierra: hay gemas del infinito en nuestro planeta, el vínculo con otros planos del universo está establecido, Thor ya nos visitó –enamorándose de paso de Natalie Portman–, Loki nos tiene en la mira y Peter Quill sigue buscando un origen que nos acerca a las insidiosas disputas de un vasto universo.  La destrucción de Ultron, con Vision representando una fuerza de vida frente a los designios escondidos de Thanos –que son un impulso de muerte–, introdujo al MCU a la escala cósmica del universo Marvel que se espera, en todo esplendor para el regreso, justamente, de los Russo en el 2018 con Infinity Wars – Part I. Así, si la anterior película de Avengers dispone la trama cósmica del universo Marvel, Captain America: Civil War responde con la importancia de las relaciones humanas, de la intimidad de los superhéroes, del diálogo más allá de la acción, de la imposibilidad de comunicación, de la división de afectos, de la política humana y de los sentimientos más básicamente nuestros como la venganza, la ira, la culpa y el ego detrás de todo. Esta película cambia entonces, como dijimos, la escala cósmica por la escala íntima: es por eso también que no hubiera tenido ningún sentido ver aquí a Thor o a Hulk. Y digo, ninguno de los dos aparece en verdad en los cómics de Civil War (si no es por el extraño Thor tecnológico que mata a Goliath en un asunto similar a la caída de Rodney Rhodes con el rayo de Vision). Pero estos dos personajes hubieran cambiado el balance por fuerza (Hulk) y potencia divina (Thor) alejando la trama de los héroes humanos que vemos aquí. Digo, lo más sobrenatural en la increíble escena central del aeropuerto son los poderes de Spider-Man que se minimizan rápido por la inexperiencia del muchacho. Esta película cambia entonces, como dijimos, la escala cósmica por la escala íntima: es por eso también que no hubiera tenido ningún sentido ver aquí a Thor o a Hulk. Esta película cambia entonces, como dijimos, la escala cósmica por la escala íntima: es por eso también que no hubiera tenido ningún sentido ver aquí a Thor o a Hulk. Y sí, si observan detenidamente el plan de Marvel para la tercera fase de su universo fílmico podemos ver cómo se sitúan todas sus cintas en esta misma dinámica: a cada cinta de locura cósmica le seguirá una película de temática terrestre para nivelar el delirio. Así, Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) irá después de Guardians of the Galaxy 2 (2017), Black Panther (2018) después de Thor: Ragnarok (2017) y Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018) después de la primera parte de Infinity Wars (2018). Todo esto perfectamente calculado para encontrar un equilibrio saludable entre los problemas que nos rebasan completamente y los conflictos internos de unos personajes que sentimos cada vez más cercanos. Es por eso que esta cinta se centra tanto en temas políticos –sin tampoco pretender mucho– y en los traumas íntimos de sus dos personajes principales. La cinta nos presenta otro lado de Tony Stark con un sorprendentemente joven Downey Jr. arrepintiéndose de no haber sido más cariñoso con sus padres antes de la tragedia que les privó la vida. En una conferencia de MIT, el hombre de hierro se muestra vulnerable, admite su impulso de creatividad como una forma de reconstruir lo que está para siempre perdido, siente la ausencia de Pepper Pots y se nos revela, finalmente, como lo que fue en la serie de Civil War: una persona esencialmente solitaria, corroída por la culpa y con tendencias autodestructivas. La confrontación, frente al elevador, con una madre dolida que le tira en cara el haber asesinado a su hijo, es la gota que derrama un vaso saturado de traumas. La cinta no tenía que decirnos nada más de un personaje que lleva construyéndose en pantalla desde hace ocho años y sin embargo lo hace para volver aún más irreconciliables las diferencias con el Capitán América. Por su parte, ésta es la continuación perfecta a la nostalgia de Steve Rogers en Winter Soldier. Recordemos nada más cómo se paseaba por el Smithsonian en una exposición sobre sí mismo para recordar a los que se fueron y para encontrar, en su lecho de muerte, a Peggy Carter. Ahora lo vemos reaccionando embrutecido a la mención que hace Crossbones de Bucky para pasar inmediatamente al funeral de la última persona que quedaba en vida de su vieja época. Esto hace el vínculo con Barnes muchísimo más estrecho y vuelve completamente orgánica la separación final e inminente entre Stark y Rogers: uno está sumido en la culpa y el recuerdo latente de sus padres muertos, el otro en la nostalgia de un tiempo perdido y el cariño hacia la única persona que, un siglo después, sigue compartiendo con él todas sus vivencias. El Soldado del Invierno se convierte así en el pivote lógico de la enemistad que causa la guerra civil entre los Avengers y toda la trama política del cómic se vuelve un problema íntimo, sentimental, a la escala muy terrestre de sus debidas proporciones cinemáticas. El Soldado del Invierno se convierte así en el pivote lógico de la enemistad que causa la guerra civil entre los Avengers y toda la trama política del cómic se vuelve un problema íntimo, sentimental, a la escala muy terrestre de sus debidas proporciones cinemáticas. El Soldado del Invierno se convierte así en el pivote lógico de la enemistad que causa la guerra civil entre los Avengers y toda la trama política del cómic se vuelve un problema íntimo, sentimental, a la escala muy terrestre de sus debidas proporciones cinemáticas. El plan de Zemo aparece entonces como algo genial: al hablar al hotel para pedir su último desayuno impulsa a que el gobierno alemán encuentre al psicólogo asesinado y al disfraz que lo hizo pasar por Barnes: sólo así logra que Iron Man se confronte con la visión –por cierto bastante cruda– de Bucky matando a golpes a sus padres. No hay ningún azar extraño en la enemistad, no se juega la locura imperfecta de un plan macabro (como el de Luthor en Dawn of Justice) y no se vislumbra una posibilidad de reconciliación (como el nombre de Martha en la cinta de DC). Aquí todo cuadra para encontrar, como al final de la serie de cómics, al Capitán América en prisión, sólo que ahora está salvando al grupo que lo apoyó e iniciando verdaderamente la separación definitiva de los Avengers. En este esquema, como en los cómics, la guerra civil no es algo que se resuelve sino un continuo poderoso que marcará definitivamente el MCU para las futuras cintas. Y sólo un titán obsesionado con la muerte podrá, potencialmente, reconciliar lo que se rompió en la verdadera intimidad frágil de los hombres más poderosos del mundo. Por extraño que parezca, ya no hay mucha diferencia entre una película de Avengers y una trama, en apariencia individual, como la saga de Captain America. El universo fílmico de Marvel ha logrado tal consistencia en su entrelazamiento de películas que ya los títulos de personajes tan centrales como Steve Rogers o Tony Stark se abren, de forma orgánica, para convertirse en películas de ensamble con una complejísima amalgama de personajes. La cuestión aquí parece ser, más bien, elegir quién se puede quedar fuera para no volver aún más convulso el encuentro de superhéroes. Y, aun así, entre tantos personajes conocidos y la ausencia de algunos grandes ejes de la trama original, los guionistas de esta sólida cinta se permitieron introducir de forma orgánica la presencia de dos grandes héroes como Spider-Man y Black Panther. Esta inclusión muestra bien la habilidad y paciencia de Marvel para la adaptación: a pesar de llevar ocho años mostrándonos a superhéroes en pantalla, todavía tienen la capacidad de maravillarnos y sorprender. Porque el rey T’Challa sigue rodeado de misterio, porque esta nueva encarnación genial de Spider-Man sigue guardando sus promesas. En la escena central del aeropuerto se nota el amor de los Russo por los cómics: la secuencia se construye como una enorme doble plana central, llena de color y simetría. Y ese amor se siente también en el cuidado de la adaptación en el guión, en el desarrollo siempre sorprendente de personajes conocidos, en el uso discreto y bien puntuado de villanos como Zemo, en la forma orgánica de relacionar un universo complejo en otro medio exigente. Lo que está haciendo el MCU nunca antes se había hecho; lograrlo además mostrando paciencia, gusto y cariño es simplemente encomiable. Civil War cambió la enorme escala de los cómics, sus tramas políticas y su inabarcable abanico de personajes por una trama íntima que enfrenta a los grandes héroes de este universo desde sus traumas más añejos. El resultado es orgánico, sorpresivo, coherente y logrado. Las eternas peleas de Age of Ultron se balancean aquí con largos pasajes de diálogo que no cansan, las consecuencias cósmicas a las que se enfrentan los Avengers se convierten en insuperables conflictos internos y las promesas de la tercera fase de un universo vastísimo se instalan con todas las potencialidades de un proyecto realizado con tino, paciencia e inigualable soltura. Marvel ya dejó atrás la conquista, lo que ahora vemos es la confianza de un imperio.  Elenco: Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Tom Holland, Don Cheadle, Paul Rudd, Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Chadwick Boseman, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Bettany, Jeremy Renner, John Hurt, Daniel Brühl."
"Apr 12, 2017",positive,Captain America: Civil War proves that Marvel knows how to lay down a stunning foundation in order to detail an epic saga.
"Mar 23, 2017",positive," Coming out a month after the miserable bomb that was Batman V Superman has only helped to make Marvel's latest entry into the Avengers franchise look like a damn classic in comparison. Captain America: Civil War isn't as instantly likeable as the first Avengers movie was, but it's certainly a better night at the movies than watching Batman and Superman fight a battle in a bleak and murky hellscape. And have no doubt: this is more of an Avengers movie than it is a Captain America one, with almost all of the Avengers returning, (minus big hitters Hulk and Thor), and with the addition of a few new members, including Spider-Man (Tom Holland) and the Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), to the team. Well, actually, teams, as the central conflict pits the superheroes against each other. The world has finally gotten a little fed up with the collective collateral damage inflicted by the Avengers every time they save the world. And after innocent lives are lost one again, during the film's opening battle, Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt and his amazing wig) and the U.N. decide to force the Avengers to sign an accord that would, depending on how you look at it, either completely limit their ability to act or put some much needed governance on their growing power. Somewhat ironically, the renegade Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is for the signing of the accord, while Captain America (Chris Evans), is against it. In both cases, their reasoning is pretty selfish. Stark thinks stepping away from the Avenging biz will result in the return of his beloved, Pepper Potts (who does not make an appearance in the movie), while Cap wants the freedom to help save his friend Bucky, aka the Winter Soldier, (Sebastian Stan), who he's convinced has been wrongfully accused of a terrorist act. As battle lines are drawn, it comes down to a ""civil war,"" with the Avengers either joining team Iron Man or team Captain, and it's this literal fight between them all that is the highlight of the movie. Once again I couldn't help but compare it to Batman Vs. Superman, and its fight scenes, which were dark, depressing, and ugly. Here we have a huge battle in broad daylight, on a relatively uncluttered airfield, fittingly devoid of people. (After all, more innocent deaths are the last thing they need). But, more importantly, the battle is fun. Seeing Spider-Man fight Captain America is fun. Watching Iron Man fight-in-flight with Falcon is fun. Watching Hawkeye shoot arrows at...well, ok watching Hawkeye is never fun. But the scene as a whole is still wildly entertaining, culminating in a literal giant surprise. While there is a villain in the story, it's not the usual invading alien hordes or omnipotent superbeing; It's just a dude with a grudge. The Avengers have a lot of death to answer to, but in a clever way, the movie also manages to indict us, the audience, for getting off on the massive destruction seen in all those previous films. We should be ashamed of ourselves!"
"Mar 7, 2017",positive," Both the films are similar on so many levels, yet cannot be more different from each other as a whole. While the DC movie was a sad reminder that superhero films can be a dull, depressing and a horrible disappointment, Captain America Civil War is a bright, energetic and often hilarious celebration of the genre, and a reassurance that superheroes, despite their over-saturation in cinema screens, can still be fun. Directed by the Russo brothers who also made the previous Captain America movie, Civil War is a sassy demonstration of Marvel being at the very top of their game. This is pretty much Avengers 2.5 because almost everyone is in attendance, and is way better than Age of Ultron and also more fun that the first Avengers film in some ways. If you’ve been following the Marvel movies over the past few years you don’t need the plot to be explained to you. Iron Man (Downey Jr) and Captain America (Evans) have a disagreement – while the former wants the Avengers to be regulated by a higher authority, the latter doesn’t believe in that because their mission is to simply save people and not indulge in bureaucracy. But here’s the thing – unlike in Batman vs Superman, the conflict here is actually believable. There is some genuine debate between Iron Man and Captain America on the issue at hand, and a fairly credible escalation of events that leads to a full on battle between the two. Most other Marvel films are basically the same movie, but this one is so different because it is bold enough to tread into bolder and intelligent themes. The audience is presented with the interesting fact that the Avengers should be answerable to someone, and they should take responsibility for their actions. All the pretty explosions you have been seeing are not just for show, but they affect people in the movie universe. Houses are destroyed and people are killed. There needs to be someone to watch the Watchmen. Yes, the problem that Iron Man and Captain America have could be sorted if one of them simply told the other some vital information (that someone is manipulating events), but it’s easy to forget this contrivance when the pyrotechnics on screen are so damn good. Seriously, Civil War has some of the most amazing action sequences ever put on screen. There’s an insane scene at an airport that will leave your tongues wagging and dribble dropping on the floor. The Russos continue to incorporate the awesome ‘tag team’ fight choreography where one superhero initiates his move on the bad guy, and another superhero finishes off the baddie with his own move. The best part of all this is that all the action takes place in broad daylight, making the stuff happening on screen coherent. What’s more, the movie has a whole bunch of laugh out loud moments. A moment where Captain scores a date and two of his friends nod in appreciation gets the whole theater roaring in laughter. After watching the hilariously subversive Deadpool, I was convinced that I could never again take a straightforward superhero movie seriously. Captain America Civil War undid my thought process just two months later. The biggest takeaway from this film was that Black Panther looks sleek as hell, and one just can’t wait for the next slew of Marvel superhero films like Doctor Strange. So it’s not a question of whether you should see this movie, it’s of which the biggest cinema screen in your city is and when the earliest show is."
"Feb 22, 2017",positive," Superhero films are seemingly a dime a dozen lately. Though only the beginning of May, we have already seen the release of Deadpool, Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice, and the current film Captain America: Civil War, with many more to come before the end of the year. How to distinguish a film, then, in such an overcrowded world? The Russo Brothers, who also directed the exceptional Winter Soldier, have somehow managed to do just that. With some incredibly innovative action, some deeper, thought-provoking themes, and a plethora of dynamic characters, both old and new, Captain America: Civil War is among the very best of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.The Buildup and ConfrontationCaptain America: Civil War is the next in the continuing series of the Avengers. Now, after several city-wide destructions, the Avengers are under intense scrutiny by the government, who will no longer tolerate their mostly supervision-free organization. The resulting clause, called the Sokovia Accords, would require the full permission of a governing body before they could intervene in any future worldwide incidents. Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), still feeling guilty after his creation of the villainous Ultron, is completely in support of the Accords, while Captain America (Chris Evans) is suspicious of the government’s agenda, preferring for the Avengers to remain an independent organization.source: Walt Disney Studios Motion PicturesSuch conflicting points of view can seemingly only end in a fight, yet it’s still not quite enough. Since this is a Captain America movie, it only makes sense for the conflict to mainly focus on his decisions, which here are influenced by his past. Here, the conflict comes in the form of Bucky Barnes aka the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), who is a wanted fugitive for his war crimes, though Cap still supports him due to their history and also because Bucky had been brainwashed while committing those crimes.The Russo Brothers really spent a great deal of effort to make the story of Civil War believable. Though they had plenty of assistance from past films, even as far back as the first Avengers, where Captain America and Iron Man were always at odds, they still needed to show some real depth to the story in order to make a film where two principal and likable superheroes fight one another. The buildup from friend to enemy is slow but steady, and by the conclusion their confrontation even becomes potentially one of the darker aspects of the entire Marvel universe.Characters, New and OldIt’s not just Captain America and Iron Man who are fighting here, either. There are several superheroes who align with one or the other, depending on their personal point of view. On Iron Man’s side is Black Widow (Scarlet Johannson), Vision (Paul Bettany), War Machine (Don Cheadle), and newcomers Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland). And on Cap’s side are the Winter Soldier, in addition to Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). Such a numerous amount of superheroes could easily seem excessive, yet the Russo Brothers manage to seamlessly weave their interactions, and often in the least invasive way possible.Once again, such an aspect is helped by past films, which had already introduced nearly every character present, with the exception of Black Panther and Spider-Man. Yet, they needed to also move the arcs of existing characters in a way that was credible. A character such as Ant-Man joining the Captain America side makes sense due to his past life as a criminal, while Black Panther’s alliance with Iron Man is reasonable due to his life as the son of a King. I had seen an interview with the Russo Brothers about this film, in which they conceived of the story by running through the script with each character, making sure that their arc from start to finish was engaging and never at odds with their previous motives. The writers of Batman v. Superman, with its throwaway, unlikable characters, would have benefited from the same strategy.source: Walt Disney Studios Motion PicturesAs mentioned, Civil War is not only a Captain America film, but also a place to introduce further stories down the line. The characters of Black Panther and Spider-Man were added to the story as a way to establish them before getting their own solo films (Black Panther is coming in February 2018, while Spider-Man: Homecoming premieres next summer). Such an addition might have made Civil War seem to be just another entry in a continuing franchise (which is often one of the more criticized aspects of Avengers: Age of Ultron), yet here they tackle the introductions with just the right amount of screen-time.Chadwick Boseman brings a confident, strong screen presence as Black Panther, both with and without the costume, and despite only being introduced in this film, he becomes one of the film’s most memorable characters (also, his costume is just too darn cool). His screen-time is limited, but the Russo Brothers present just enough character development shrouded in mystery to make us interested in his upcoming film.I was also really looking forward to seeing Spider-Man, who has long been my favorite comic character. Yet, despite two separate film series, he has never been properly presented on the big screen. Tobey Maguire was decent as the nerdy Peter Parker, but he was often stale and bland as the legendary superhero, while Andrew Garfield was just the opposite, playing Spider-Man well but a poor Peter Parker due to his suave manner. How perfect, then, to finally see Tom Holland, whose interpretation was a hybrid of these two aspects. As a younger incarnation of Spider-Man, he is juvenile, spunky, and clearly intelligent. He is often the film’s comic relief, which is necessary in a movie that sometimes gets almost too dark to handle.Dark, Noirish ToneThe Marvel films are sometimes criticized for being too lighthearted, with few dark themes out of fear of alienating a younger audience. It was surprising to me, then, when greeted with the intensified action sequences of Civil War, with an emphasis on the final battle between Iron Man versus Captain America and the Winter Soldier. Though the airport scene is the film’s climactic highlight, this one dares to go even further into previously unseen territory.Even here, though, in a scene that could seem overly stressful due to the fiery emotions of the characters, the Russo Brothers know when to hold back just enough to keep the film levelheaded. An example is when Captain America quotes the line: “I can do this all day,” a repeated quote that was part of his repertoire as far back as the first Captain America film. Little callback aspects like this are really what help to distinguish Civil War from the many superhero films out there, which could easily have dwarfed it if not done precisely right.source: Walt Disney Studios Motion PicturesHelmut Zemo (Daniel Brühl), the film’s primary villain, though motivated by an easily predictable motive, also manages to further embellish the film with a deeper tone. Brühl, who seems particularly well-suited for playing the bad guy, is very much Marvel’s version of Lex Luthor. Though he is not a fighter on his own, he is instead intent on simply setting plans in motion, and then sitting back as the world comes apart before him.Zemo is one of the stronger Marvel villains, which makes the further addition of the character Crossbones (Frank Grillo) dull in comparison. A followup to his character in The Winter Soldier, Crossbones is all but wasted by the conclusion of the film, really lending little to no impact on its events. In a film with mostly fleshed-out characters, the character of Crossbones is unfortunately one of its more forgettable aspects.Intense, Beautifully Choreographed ActionAt the end of the day, though, Captain America: Civil War is a superhero film, and as such there are numerous acts of adrenaline-pumping action. There are four main battle sequences in the film, starting with the initial battle with the Avengers and ending with the aforementioned Iron Man versus Captain America and Winter Soldier fight. The airport scene, though, is likely to be the one that people will think back on fondly. In a scene that seems to stretch on for a great deal of time, yet thankfully never wears out its welcome, it features nearly every character from each side in its fight.source: Walt Disney Studios Motion PicturesThe tone here, thankfully, is dialed down lighter than the rest. After all, many of these characters are actually friends in person, and as such they are not trying to kill one another. Some highlights here include the boyish attitude of Spider-Man, the claw-slashing attacks of Black Panther, Scarlet Witch’s strengthened abilities, and, without dropping any spoilers, a huge moment for the character Ant-Man. It is pure, absolute, unbridled entertainment, which made me feel like a kid again watching cartoons on Saturday mornings. The Russo Brothers really understood the childlike wonderment of superheroes, and they capture that in a scene that is rarely rivaled in the genre.ConclusionCaptain America: Civil War is easily amongst the very best in a mostly exceptional line of superhero films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. With deeper themes and a darker tone, it also manages to imbue some of the more wildly entertaining action scenes that I have yet to see in a comic book movie. Though the many characters may seem overwhelming, and some of them appear wasted by the conclusion, it mostly consists of an impressive array of both new and old, and also contains quite possibly the best on-screen adaptation of the character Spider-Man.In a year already piling up with superheroes, Captain America: Civil War is the most memorable thus far. It manages to not only be a perfect conclusion for the Captain America series, but it also sets up films and stories in a way that makes me even more excited for the future of this franchise.[highlighted_p boxed=”false” center=”false”]Have you seen Captain America: Civil War?

On Iron Man’s side is Black Widow (Scarlet Johannson), Vision (Paul Bettany), War Machine (Don Cheadle), and newcomers Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland). And on Cap’s side are the Winter Soldier, in addition to Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). Such a numerous amount of superheroes could easily seem excessive, yet the Russo Brothers manage to seamlessly weave their interactions, and often in the least invasive way possible. Once again, such an aspect is helped by past films, which had already introduced nearly every character present, with the exception of Black Panther and Spider-Man. Yet, they needed to also move the arcs of existing characters in a way that was credible. A character such as Ant-Man joining the Captain America side makes sense due to his past life as a criminal, while Black Panther’s alliance with Iron Man is reasonable due to his life as the son of a King. I had seen an interview with the Russo Brothers about this film, in which they conceived of the story by running through the script with each character, making sure that their arc from start to finish was engaging and never at odds with their previous motives. The writers of Batman v. Superman, with its throwaway, unlikable characters, would have benefited from the same strategy.source: Walt Disney Studios Motion PicturesAs mentioned, Civil War is not only a Captain America film, but also a place to introduce further stories down the line. The characters of Black Panther and Spider-Man were added to the story as a way to establish them before getting their own solo films (Black Panther is coming in February 2018, while Spider-Man: Homecoming premieres next summer). Such an addition might have made Civil War seem to be just another entry in a continuing franchise (which is often one of the more criticized aspects of Avengers: Age of Ultron), yet here they tackle the introductions with just the right amount of screen-time.Chadwick Boseman brings a confident, strong screen presence as Black Panther, both with and without the costume, and despite only being introduced in this film, he becomes one of the film’s most memorable characters (also, his costume is just too darn cool). His screen-time is limited, but the Russo Brothers present just enough character development shrouded in mystery to make us interested in his upcoming film.I was also really looking forward to seeing Spider-Man, who has long been my favorite comic character. Yet, despite two separate film series, he has never been properly presented on the big screen. Tobey Maguire was decent as the nerdy Peter Parker, but he was often stale and bland as the legendary superhero, while Andrew Garfield was just the opposite, playing Spider-Man well but a poor Peter Parker due to his suave manner. How perfect, then, to finally see Tom Holland, whose interpretation was a hybrid of these two aspects. As a younger incarnation of Spider-Man, he is juvenile, spunky, and clearly intelligent. He is often the film’s comic relief, which is necessary in a movie that sometimes gets almost too dark to handle.Dark, Noirish ToneThe Marvel films are sometimes criticized for being too lighthearted, with few dark themes out of fear of alienating a younger audience. It was surprising to me, then, when greeted with the intensified action sequences of Civil War, with an emphasis on the final battle between Iron Man versus Captain America and the Winter Soldier. Though the airport scene is the film’s climactic highlight, this one dares to go even further into previously unseen territory.Even here, though, in a scene that could seem overly stressful due to the fiery emotions of the characters, the Russo Brothers know when to hold back just enough to keep the film levelheaded. An example is when Captain America quotes the line: “I can do this all day,” a repeated quote that was part of his repertoire as far back as the first Captain America film. Little callback aspects like this are really what help to distinguish Civil War from the many superhero films out there, which could easily have dwarfed it if not done precisely right.source: Walt Disney Studios Motion PicturesHelmut Zemo (Daniel Brühl), the film’s primary villain, though motivated by an easily predictable motive, also manages to further embellish the film with a deeper tone. Brühl, who seems particularly well-suited for playing the bad guy, is very much Marvel’s version of Lex Luthor. Though he is not a fighter on his own, he is instead intent on simply setting plans in motion, and then sitting back as the world comes apart before him.Zemo is one of the stronger Marvel villains, which makes the further addition of the character Crossbones (Frank Grillo) dull in comparison. A followup to his character in The Winter Soldier, Crossbones is all but wasted by the conclusion of the film, really lending little to no impact on its events. In a film with mostly fleshed-out characters, the character of Crossbones is unfortunately one of its more forgettable aspects.Intense, Beautifully Choreographed ActionAt the end of the day, though, Captain America: Civil War is a superhero film, and as such there are numerous acts of adrenaline-pumping action. There are four main battle sequences in the film, starting with the initial battle with the Avengers and ending with the aforementioned Iron Man versus Captain America and Winter Soldier fight. The airport scene, though, is likely to be the one that people will think back on fondly. In a scene that seems to stretch on for a great deal of time, yet thankfully never wears out its welcome, it features nearly every character from each side in its fight.source: Walt Disney Studios Motion PicturesThe tone here, thankfully, is dialed down lighter than the rest. After all, many of these characters are actually friends in person, and as such they are not trying to kill one another. Some highlights here include the boyish attitude of Spider-Man, the claw-slashing attacks of Black Panther, Scarlet Witch’s strengthened abilities, and, without dropping any spoilers, a huge moment for the character Ant-Man. It is pure, absolute, unbridled entertainment, which made me feel like a kid again watching cartoons on Saturday mornings. The Russo Brothers really understood the childlike wonderment of superheroes, and they capture that in a scene that is rarely rivaled in the genre.ConclusionCaptain America: Civil War is easily amongst the very best in a mostly exceptional line of superhero films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. With deeper themes and a darker tone, it also manages to imbue some of the more wildly entertaining action scenes that I have yet to see in a comic book movie. Though the many characters may seem overwhelming, and some of them appear wasted by the conclusion, it mostly consists of an impressive array of both new and old, and also contains quite possibly the best on-screen adaptation of the character Spider-Man.In a year already piling up with superheroes, Captain America: Civil War is the most memorable thus far. It manages to not only be a perfect conclusion for the Captain America series, but it also sets up films and stories in a way that makes me even more excited for the future of this franchise.[highlighted_p boxed=”false” center=”false”]Have you seen Captain America: Civil War?

"Feb 16, 2017",positive,"Captain America: Civil War turns The Avengers inside out, forcing conflict between the characters while managing to stage big action set pieces and even bigger jokes."
"Feb 13, 2017",positive," In  2014 Captain America: The Winter Soldier was released and changed the game for Marvel films. Anthony and Joe Russo directed a film that felt different from any of its predecessors. Gone were the superhero cliches, evil super villains and played out story lines. Instead the Russo Brothers chose to create an espionage thriller dealing with current event issues with a backdrop of an incredibly compelling relationship between the hero and the villain. What resulted was perhaps the most complete and refreshing entry into the Marvel collection and an overwhelming response for the Russo Brothers. They were asked to direct the next two Avengers films and also revisit the world of Captain America with the latest entry into the franchise; Captain America: Civil War.  Captain America Civil War is completely different from any other comic book movie. The storyline of the film is something far greater than good vs evil. Both deal with very serious moral issues that are not black and white and there is no clear wrong or right side.  Winter Soldier dealt with the use of unlimited power. The main question that film raised was if the government had the potential to prevent any terrorist attack or threat to our safety should we allow that? Or would the access to that power become a threat to all of our well being? In Civil War the question that the Russo Brothers film brings up is how much power should the Avengers be trusted with? Should they have complete unlimited power? And does their power to protect us instead become a threat to all of us? Civil War works so well because of an incredible script and solid, imaginative direction, but it would be nothing without its cast. The stellar writing of this film allow the actors to be people with emotions instead of walking, talking costumes with superpowers. The incredible additions to the cast shows the credibility of the script. Adding amazing talents of new and old such as William Hurt, Martin Freeman, Daniel Bruhl and the fantastic Chadwick Boseman. There also is the clever and incredibly hilarious addition of Spider-Man played by Tom Holland.  It is hard to think of anything this film does wrong. But there is one thing this film does better than any film I can ever remember.  
The line between good and evil is usually something so clearly drawn out in any film one goes to see. There is typically right and wrong and the audience usually has a shared interest and a clear nudge in who and what to root for. In Civil War that is completely thrown out. The Marvel franchise has done such a beautiful job in creating so many characters we know and love; they make us cheer, they make us laugh and they can make us truly care for them. In perhaps the greatest scene in any Marvel film ever these characters square off against each other in a battle for what both sides believe is right and good.  It is an incredible test of emotions for the viewer. These are all people we love who are attacking the other people we love. It is hard to imagine a similar moment in film where this was handled so eloquently and so well. Zack Snyder could have learned so much from every frame of this film. Captain America: Civil War is the best comic book film since The Dark Knight. This is due to the filmmakers choosing not to just make a great superhero movie, but instead make a great film that blurs the line of what the world expects from them. While The Dark Knight was an incredibly heavy film that felt more like a Scorsese gangster classic with a man dressed as a bat, Civil War feels like a genre clash of all that is good. It has moments that are very dark, but it is so quick to follow up with fun surprises, huge laughs and thrilling action sequences. It’s nearly a perfect comic book film.  The Russo Brothers are continuing to raise the bar for the Avengers, Marvel and themselves. It was hard to expect a better film than Winter Soldier and they somehow pulled it off. Over the next three years they will direct both additions to the Avengers franchise with Infinity War Part I and Part II. Have they set the bar too high? Perhaps, but if there was any two people to trust with taking the Marvel franchise to an even higher high, it is. Anthony and Joe Russo."
"Jan 1, 2017",positive," 
Captain America: Civil War has, by a conservative estimate, 13 significant characters. Eleven of those characters have both birth names and superhero names, not to mention superpowers and super-accessories. Every single one of those characters has a backstory — sometimes a lengthy and complex one — that helps drive the events of the plot.
 
What this tells us is that tent-pole films are no longer envisioned as self-enclosed stories geared to virgin viewers. The Marvelverse is a transmedia empire that encompasses theatrical films, source comics, multiple TV series and more. And Civil War assumes that viewers have a strong acquaintance with the previous films at the bare minimum. If you've been sticking to the full-ensemble Avengers extravaganzas and didn't see Ant-Man, for instance, you're going to be mighty confused when Paul Rudd suddenly pops up and starts quipping.
 
Confused, but not necessarily unhappy. While Civil War is as wide in scope and as information-overloaded as last year's Avengers: Age of Ultron, it's also more intimate and character-driven, and hence more compelling.
 
That's because the plot pivots on two personal bonds: one broken, the other restored. The broken bond is the one between the title character (Chris Evans) and Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.). In the wake of Ultron's devastation — for which Stark bears the lion's share of responsibility — the bad-boy inventor is ready to let the United Nations step in and give marching orders to the superhero collective. But Captain America/Steve Rogers, the unfrozen patriot, is increasingly suspicious of the military brass and bureaucrats who want to control him.
 
The other pivotal bond is between Steve and his childhood friend, Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), who rose again as the brainwashed Winter Soldier in the film of that name. When Bucky is implicated in the assassination of an African monarch, Steve stands by his friend, defying the UN orders to take him down.
 
Captain America's renegade status splits the Avengers in two camps and spirals into a conflict that culminates in an all-out battle on an airfield, with surprise guests. Like all the film's action sequences, this one is breathtakingly fast and cleverly staged by directors Anthony and Joe Russo (who also did the previous Captain America installment).
 
Where the climax of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice was positively Wagnerian, turning its battling superheroes into oddly similar icons, the Russos never let you forget you're watching comic-book characters. They keep pausing the storm and fury for moments of bonding and bantering. It's a layering effect that works better with panels and speech balloons, but the Marvel team does it about as well as it's possible to do on-screen. More importantly, all that character development pays off in the film's eventual climax, which feels less like a standard blockbuster blowout than a superpowered version of a pivotal cable drama episode.
 
Yes, it's all a bit much — by the film's end, not one but three characters have gone on tearful rampages fueled by the need to avenge a loved one's death. Besides bringing long-simmering conflicts to a boil, Civil War introduces players new to the movie-verse, such as Chadwick Boseman as the princely Black Panther, and gives them conflicts of their own.
 
For complete Marvel neophytes, it's likely to be a baffling, if loud and shiny, experience. But then, that describes most blockbusters these days. The good news about Civil War is that those willing to bone up on the backstory will find characters they actually care about enough to root for. Neither Steve nor Tony is obviously wrong in his approach to the age-old problem of freedom and responsibility, and both argue their cases with more grace than many figures on the current American electoral landscape. Civil wars get a lot less civil than this one.

"Dec 31, 2016",positive,Captain America: Civil War is without a doubt my new favorite superhero movie.
"Dec 30, 2016",positive,"When the big battle between two feuding factions of the Avengers finally happens, it's a doozy."
"Dec 17, 2016",negative," The simple task of a blockbuster director is to behave like a bargain-basement drug dealer, supplying his convulsing, frothing patient with the steady narcotic drip-drip. All he needs to do is make sure the good stuff is coming through at sufficient a rate so everyone dutifully zombies their way back into the cinema when it is time for the next dose. Never mind if his stuff is cut with unbelievable dross, if the acting is terrible, the costumes are hideous, if the wigs are preposterous and the codpieces are disappointingly flat, loyal fans will still come back to be expertly fleeced — and screw everyone who hasn’t watched the last umpteen films and has no idea what’s going on."
"Dec 13, 2016",positive," Steve Rogers aka Captain America (Chris Evans) has a secret: his best friend Bucky Barnes aka The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) has managed to break his programming that keeps him an obedient soldier, but he doesn’t trust anyone and chooses to be left alone. On the eve of the signing of the Superhero Registration Act aka the Sokovia Accords (named for the country Age of Ultron targeted), Cap and Tony Stark aka Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) are at odds over the implications, mainly that politicians would decide who should and shouldn’t be helped. They’re both right in their own way, but when Bucky being fingered in a terrorist attack is offered as proof of needing such UN legislation, Rogers decides to confront Bucky himself and before he can be apprehended by Iron Man — that is, if the Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) doesn’t kill the winter Soldier first in an act of revenge. Most of the current Marvel Cinematic Universe squares off in a throw-down over principles and secrets as lines are drawn and friendships are tested, but who will pay the ultimate price for their convictions? Captain America: The Winter Soldier directors, the Russo brothers, twisted the MCU formula with a cold war spy thriller take on the superhero; with Civil War, they dare not only to pit our heroes against one another but challenge them in the worst possible way. Sure, comic book fans love to argue who can whip who in a fight, but the trailers suggest there’s no way Civil War can end in anything but a downer. While it’s pretty clear no one important dies in the MCU, it sure looks like neither Steve nor Tony have any intention of backing down; it’s also probably a good thing Hulk and Thor managed to steer clear of this. Hold onto your privates, generals…

While the big set piece is the super-brawl that ends the second act, the third act is exactly what we expected: hard to watch in the most dramatic way possible. If you’re the kind of viewer who wonders why name actors are picked for these parts instead of just any up-and-coming thespian, these are those moments. For a genius-billionaire-playboy-philanthropist, Robert Downey Jr. knows how to bring “the haunted,” painting Tony Stark as someone who never wanted the responsibility that goes with the limelight — heavy is the head that wears the crown. In full contrast to the get-it-done-now and grieve later attitude of Steve Rogers, this is exactly what we asked for since he and Tony squared off in The Avengers… but it is also not what we wanted — and that’s a good thing. There are consequences for actions, and nothing here is black or white. Before the world went spiraling out of control, however, we are treated to some amazing moments as superheroes meet one another for the first time, including the Sony-sanctioned debut of Spider-Man in the MCU (due for his own feature film Homecoming next summer). The airport battle is a comic book double-sized issue full of combat goodness (and much easier to follow than the Age of Ultron finale free-for-all), including all the fan-boy reluctance of beating up fellow admired heroes and plenty of great one-liners. The scene is what it is, but it isn’t all fun and games; unlike DC where characters only appear to have one emotion at a time, complexity is the order of the day, and you never know who’ll do what until it happens. Those invested in these characters may feel the need to scream at the screen a time or two; yeah, it does that. It’s interesting that, while this film was being made simultaneously as Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice, there’s a sense of Civil War being the right way to do this, a bullet list of what can work and what shouldn’t be done when heroes collide — it’s like they knew! This isn’t the kind of movie you buy to watch over and over again; it’s the kind you know which scenes are you favorites to skip to and for watching all the making-of features to remind yourself “It’s just a movie.” Kudos to the Russos for bringing the heat, but let’s not do this downer thing again for a while, okay?"
