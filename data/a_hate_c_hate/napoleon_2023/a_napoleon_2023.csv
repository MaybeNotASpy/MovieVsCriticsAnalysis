Apr 14 2024,negative,i was so disappointed it didnt move me at all it was impossible to get to know the characters no chemistry between the main characters
Apr 14 2024,negative,poorly cast and a bad script not a well told story 
Apr 13 2024,positive,entertaining but i feel it could have been deeper did napoleon really only have on facial expression and was his life really only about war and lust
Apr 12 2024,negative,only focusing in negative aspects of napoleon example 1 of the movie on victories 50 on defeats and the rest on bad life no reference on what he achieved internally and internationally   very bad aspect only good point is joaquin phoenix performance
Apr 10 2024,negative,i could not watch this movie all the way through because it got way too raunchy along with being ridiculous as far as acting and accuracy why do directors and producers have to fill their movies with filth these days i recommend that you avoid this garbage
Apr 10 2024,negative,truly awful historical inaccuracies aside and the movie is nothing but it fails to be entertaining on its own merits    i have no idea how this bloated piece of garbage was created from one of the most interesting stories of all time
Apr 9 2024,positive,this movie  is far better that the mediocre reviews it has received just enjoy it and stop critiquing while watching
Apr 9 2024,negative,the saddest  the most boring napoleon movie ive ever seen music is good napoleon is a wimp usually very good joaquin phoenix is meh  most of it is forgettable
Apr 9 2024,positive,74 joaquin was very good sometimes felt kind of jokery tho so not sure if thats just his style or theyre trying to portray napoleon as a less masculine frenchman 4 or so very good battle scenes mostly about napoleons life as he comes into power til his death and was kind of slow and not that exciting was hoping for more no need to rewatch anytime soon 25 rewatch
Apr 8 2024,positive,scotts napoleon did not know how to give us a more personal drama in which we could enjoy the true drama story of the emperor  however the special effects and battle scenes are memorable and thats the strength of the film but when we talking about the story of one of the greatest conquistadors of all time the structured script must be solid so that the story is as epic as what the books tell us
Apr 8 2024,positive,saved by joaquin phoenixs performance    disjointed film that lacked any real historical substance and spent far too much time focusing on np relationships with josephine    i felt it was yet another massive production aimed at not upsetting the minority     real opportunity missed
Apr 8 2024,positive,put off watching until i could see it for free at home and to be honest i could have just skipped it all together i did not find the film boring but i did find it to be unfortunate the dramatic interactions between napoleon and josephine are rather flat especially in the beginning the fighting seems to be rushed most of the time and we are not given enough to truly appreciate napoleons skill as a general the battle at waterloo seems too drawn out while other battles see too brief by the time i reached the end i couldnt help but feel a bit cheated as if someone had chopped out much of the good stuff
Apr 7 2024,negative,i had so much hope this would be a good movie because phoenix is an amazing actor  even the battle scenes were less than i expected  little historical fact jumps around through years and was that romance or just tripe  well ummm you decide      what a total disappointment for us
Apr 6 2024,positive,it was great i really liked it
Apr 5 2024,negative,ill always find time for ridley scott but i have no idea who this is for
Apr 3 2024,positive,interesting subject but not an interesting enough movie
Apr 3 2024,positive,i did enjoy it because i love history  it was ok but i would have set it out a bit more clearer without all the nonsense moments between napoleon and josephine  i know the long stares and poses are supposed to set the mood but i dont think people act quite like this in real life so it annoyed me a bit other than that it was ok
Apr 3 2024,positive,i watched this film with low expectations this movie is neither fun nor good i was bored i knew what would happen and surprisingly since i dont like war movies my favourite parts were the battles they looked amazing the acting performances were solid but just like in killers of the flower moon there were no relatable characters there wasnt anybody to root for and i need that in a film this movie is long boring and does not show anything new ridley scotts acting the cinematography joaquin phoenixs and vanessa kirbys acting could not save it i think this movie is really mediocre
Apr 1 2024,negative,do yourself a favour and dont bother  clearly written and directed in the eyes of the victor aka english gone is the heroic french general and in his place is a boring man beholden to his unfaithful wifes lower half  such a historic figure deserved better than a two and a half hour hit piece
Apr 1 2024,negative,poor choice of focus dull not exciting not worthy of the award noms
Apr 1 2024,positive,ridley scotts napoleon biopic is an agreeable easter day afternoon watch an engaging blend of high camp bloody spectacle and pretension puncturing humour phoenix is well cast for this take on napoleon whilst his emperor lacks a sort of predatory danger that the script hints at his performances lances pomposity and is devoid of pofaced seriousness vanessa kirby is the one who really shines as josephine however every minute shes not on screen feels a little less than it could be    the wit and the action are all welcome and enjoyable and it slips down nicely but its hard to shake the feeling that it ends up being neither one thing nor the other im tempted to think what a directors cut of this might reveal which of the constitute elements would it bring out more of suggesting what the film really could have been     its undemanding enjoyable fare that leaves you sated but with that slight sense of what could have been
Apr 1 2024,negative,it was so boring i fell asleep uninspiring and horrible storytelling
Mar 31 2024,neutral,slow not engaging expected more 
Mar 31 2024,negative,rather than repeating what so many others have said about why its a terrible movie miscasting pacing bad script with great visuals that are fictitious depictions of battles i recommend in its place a movie on the opposite end of the spectrum    the 1970 movie  waterloo  rod steiger as napoleon and christopher plummer as wellington do justice to their roles and show how a good script great directing and amazing acting can immerse the audience in a movie  dan oherlihy is great in the supporting role of marshal ney      unlike scotts debacle waterloo sticks fairly close to the historical sequence of events of the hundred days covering the battles leading up to waterloo  while some of the allied forces are missing the movie does better justice to the role that blücher and the prussians played in coordinating their movements towards the final battle    what makes waterloo all the more impressive is that it was filmed without cgi  taken as the epic that it is the battle is breathtaking and puts scotts appalling computerized and big budget effort to shame
Mar 31 2024,neutral,to much about his marriage not enough about his battles
Mar 31 2024,negative,i didnt believe all those who told me this film was dull as dishwater i do now
Mar 31 2024,positive,for english below    ein historienfilm der mal nicht langweilt man spürt sofort hier war einer der ganz großen regisseure am werk ridley scotts filme erzeugen bei mir seit alien1 schon per se immer eine freudige erwartungshaltung napoleon ist top besetzt und liefert durchgehend fantastische bilder tolle kleine geschichten werden auch in den ruhigen szenen erzählt die auch raum für emotionen lassen der musikscore ist grandios und die dolby atmos tonspur feuert im wahrsten sinne ein feuerwerk ab zwar hätte ich hier dtsx bevorzugt dies ist jedoch bei einem film auf appletv plus nicht möglich das bild ist sehr scharf und frei von filmkorn was dem film eigentlich ganz gut gestanden hätte es wirkt dadurch etwas zu aufgeräumt und soft das bildformat ist gigantisch letterboxed was beim thema historienfilm voll in ordnung geht für effekte sorgt industrial light and magic die sich hier mal wieder selbst übertroffen haben nähmlich immer dann wenn man effekte überhaupt nicht als effekte wahrnimmt vielen dank lieber ridley scott für dieses epos ich hoffe sehr auf eine 4k uhd collectors edition mit einem ihrer starken directors cuts für meine sammlung und mein heimkino     a historical movie that doesnt bore you for once you immediately sense that one of the great directors was at work here ever since alien1 ridley scotts films have always given me a sense of anticipation napoleon has a top cast and delivers fantastic images throughout great little stories are also told in the quiet scenes which also leave room for emotions the music score is terrific and the dolby atmos soundtrack fires off fireworks in the truest sense of the word although i would have preferred dtsx here this is not possible with a movie on appletv plus the picture is very sharp and free of film grain which would actually have suited the movie quite well this makes it look a little too clean and soft the picture format is gigantic letterboxed which is perfectly fine for a historical film effects are provided by industrial light and magic who have once again outdone themselves here namely whenever effects are not perceived as effects at all thank you dear ridley scott for this epic im really hoping for a 4k uhd collectors edition with one of your strong directors cuts for my collection and my home theater     translated with deeplcom free version
Mar 29 2024,negative,a truly dreadful movie with a dismally bad script that tells us nothing about the time it pretends to portray and how napoleon actually attained power phoenix lacks any hint of the charisma napoleon must have had and his voice is pitifully weak against almost every other characters napoleon as bad pulp fiction
Mar 29 2024,positive,juaquin phoenix is miscast as napoleon everything else in scotts film works well especially the battle scenes
Mar 29 2024,negative,3 hours to confirm that napoleon was a cuck and a midget what a waste of time for everyone involved including the viewer there is nearly no story telling its like taking screenshots of a bunch of headlines with next to no detail i wish more than anything that i could recoup the time of my life wasted on this awful production
Mar 28 2024,negative,lifeless and boring
Mar 25 2024,positive,while i enjoy history my interest in more 20th century to recent history and i generally do not go for period movies all that to say im not judging this one on its factual accuracy i really liked the cinematography and both phoenix and kirby were great
Mar 25 2024,negative, what the hell did i go see i wanted a war movie about a amazing historical general not a pandering simp the entire movie was pretty much about napoleans love life do i really care no it was just boring also i do not want to see joaquin pheonix hitting it from the back and having sex let alone a entire movie everytime we got a war scene it took too long to get to it and lasted to little just to blue balls me until the next war scene stupid plainly stupid it made napolean a fierce iconic general look pathetic
Mar 24 2024,positive,ridley scott set himself the very ambitious goal of covering three grand themes in napoleons life france army and josephine unfortunately despite the lengthy run time none of these is covered in satisfying depth instead what we get is a stew of scenes comprising comical decadence gory battles and erotic conjugal dialogues
Mar 24 2024,negative,i dont buy that phoenix is napoleon i dont buy your historical errors i dont buy that the movie is dedicated to someone  napoleon had everything but he was afraid to go to war
Mar 23 2024,neutral,the movie follows napoleons journey from a young ambitious officer to a powerful ruler depicting his military victories and strategic brilliance although the films portrayal of certain events arguing that it presented a simplified or even incorrect version of napoleons complex military campaigns furthermore the movie is more focused on napoleons life especially his marriage with josephine
Mar 23 2024,negative,so sick of these movies that take famous people in the past and mock and give them childlike qualities  using poor actors  if as an example troy was done today achilles would be presented as an unathletic buffoon who was just lucky as a warrior
Mar 23 2024,neutral,im on a journey to watch all of the 2024 oscar nominees and next up was napoleon a historical epic from ridley scott about one of the most interesting figures in history napoleon bonaparte napoleon is a very good looking film and for the most part is well made though i dont like the screenplay at all and i think that the film focused too much on his relationship with josephine vanessa kirby than on napoleon joaquin phoenix himself its quite a forgettable film as well which is a shame coming from ridley scott and i was especially disappointed with the route that this film chose after its opening scene which i thought was the best scene in the entire film which really isnt how it should be it was also quite boring despite the performances being pretty good as well this film had so many of the right ingredients but the writing and direction of the film really didnt work for me i cant say i was too disappointed though as i wasnt expecting much after hearing and seeing reviews but my expectations were still a bit higher than the final product overall napoleon is a mediocre film and one of the weaker oscar nominations ive seen so far
Mar 21 2024,neutral,a very unfortunate bland tell of a great great story    ridley scotts delivery of napoleons story is more of a checkbox approach where amazing locations battles moments are directed and off to the next checkbox to tick    the movie lacks  a flow a more  serious narration that connects the events it needs to build napoleon as a character other  than year x he did that 5s we jump to the next history event    its just very bland    otherwise phoenix is good in his role but napoleon couldve been way more if the script allowed it
Mar 21 2024,positive,this film delivers epic battles and lush cinematography and features compelling performances from some of hollywoods best  yet in the end this narrative feels flat more a connection of individual scenes than a cohesive engaging story  while it is a good movie it is not the great one we hoped it would be
Mar 20 2024,negative,napoleon is not really a movie but a collection of scenes with little continuity joaquin phoenix uses one sour expression and stands like a wooden man in most scenes  nowhere is there a sense of a napoleon as a human as a real person and above all missing is insight of  what made the real napoleon a leader that a million french followed into battle
Mar 19 2024,negative,dont watch this movie if you dont wanna waste your time one of the worst movies i have ever seen i almost fell asleep while watching it the best part was when the movie finally ended
Mar 18 2024,negative,terrible movie made napoleon out to be a fool if youre watching this in the hope to see good action or to see historical accuracy or to see a brilliant military tactician at work then prepare to be let down ridley scott hasnt had a good movie since gladiator and how much of that was russell crowe
Mar 18 2024,negative,ust watched this on apple  thankfully did not waste time 2 hours and 38 minutes and good popcorn in a theater for this truly terrible film  while the production values costumes battle scenes etc were top notch the dialogue is crazily off kilter the story line jumps months ahead without time to blink and the acting from the normally superb joaquin phoenix is downright somnambulistic  there are scenes in which vanessa kirby is laughing which seem genuine but directed toward the insipid words coming out of everyones mouth  i also found it off putting that every actor was allowed whatever accent they wanted eg phoenix american kirby english in a movie primarily about french history i would have preferred the old fashion movie making where the aristocrats spoke in clipped british accents and the lower classes in cockney this is one bad film and it is unclear what ridley scott could have been thinking while making this
Mar 17 2024,negative,the movie focuses on more of the love life of napoleon this is fine but all romance scenes are either boring or uncomfortable acting is subpar with bad accents across the board the war scenes seem meaningless even though they are very impactful moments to our history this is a mess of a movie
Mar 17 2024,positive,the good scenes are good battle scenes  the performances are fine and joaquin is really good in the title role the film just feels a bit off pacing perhaps or pack of  i do like ridley scott as a filmmaker though but this film isnt up there in the best of his filmography  one good thing about this film though is that you dont need to be a historian to follow it its easy to follow but its just a super slow film for the most of its 160 minute running time
Mar 17 2024,positive,this is a great story but i am sure i am not alone in wishing that the actors were french or at least had a french accent  if this wasnt a story about france it would be amazing  the acting is amazing and everything about the movie is amazing but you just cant get around the random accents
Mar 17 2024,positive,napoleon was ok i dont know his whole history joaquin phoenix is awesome in the movie even though he may not be his brother hes still good but the movie was too long and too slow
Mar 17 2024,positive,big on spectacle little on substance spanning roughly twentyeight years the film seems very disjointed in the timeline of napoleons life jumping sometimes five years ahead and not knowing how we got to where we are pheonix seems like he is sleepwalking through the entire movie and quite miscast    by the end of the film i didnt feel as thou i had just watched a movie about one of the most controversial leaders in history ridley scott can be so hit and miss sometimes and this was a miss had his great cinema style but the story didnt work
Mar 16 2024,positive,its fine the production is obviously pretty incredible the war scenes in particular are visually impressive but the movie is missing something and i cant exactly put my finger on what it is i just dont really care about any of the characters nor do i fully understand their motivations the acting is good sure but it feels like a weird casting job to put joaquin phoenix in this role or maybe its just the accent issues which have been welldocumented on the internet why is he the only one in the film speaking in a middleamerica accent ie his normal speaking voice while everyone around him  even the french characters  speak in a british accent its so dissonant as to nearly ruin the movie for me it gives the whole thing a madefortv movie feel that is so awkwardly juxtaposed against the epic sets costumes and overall design frustrating choice by all actor director and casting director
Mar 15 2024,positive,the true story of napoleon is so much more compelling than what we see here on screen  not an awful film but one that could have been so much better
Mar 14 2024,neutral,napoleon came through as very little dull man in the middle of a huge picture and now that i think of it was that what the director was going for if so then it is a much better movie than i though but it still was a bit boring
Mar 14 2024,positive,unlike everyone else here i managed to chuckle at the sex scenes and move on    this movie was incredible it looks like it cost the budget it was given a real marvel best napolean era movie and best movie of 2023    oppenheimer was boring and barbie was a cute family movie napolean came out of left field and reminded us what a movie can be
Mar 13 2024,positive,a little disappointing watch was expecting more it was cinematic and i loved the look and feel of the period piece and the battle scenes  but the rest of the story was just flat  there was no emotional investment in the characters on my part  it didnt flow well between personal storyline and the battle story lines
Mar 13 2024,positive,just okay looks awesome decent performances
Mar 13 2024,positive,i thought it was the wrong actor   in the wrong movie
Mar 12 2024,neutral,it is not for me the man is designed not a hero but a human
Mar 12 2024,negative,i thought this film was poorly written acting was hamstrung by the crook script i couldnt finish it i had to clean my car im still trying to decide whether it was better or worse than mothra
Mar 12 2024,negative,this movie is massively disappointing in that it lacked flow and focused too much on josephine any person entering the theatre would expect to see a film demonstrating napoleons ingenious military acumen over a badly presented cheating love story i am giving one star for the battle cinematic but there simply isnt anything else that can possible save this terrible movie from being the worst representation of the greatest emperor the planet has ever seen
Mar 12 2024,positive,i was looking forward to seeing the extended version which was supposed to be released on apple tv  so when i heard that the producers had decided against it i was a little disappointed but all in all its not a bad movie at all cinematography set and custom design and the editing are excellent joaquin phoenix does a decent job portraying the man child napoleon the battle scenes are fantastic the only problem with it has already been mentioned by others and that is theyve tried to pack in too much in its 2 hour 37 minute running time i wish they had gone with a longer version split into three episodes
Mar 12 2024,negative,i hate short people 
Mar 11 2024,positive,too long to have delivered so little great battle scenes but some tawdry off battlefield ones detract greatly from an epic in name only
Mar 11 2024,negative,the story was very boring more about napoleon and his cheating wife than his actual accomplishments was bored after 20 minutes and turned it off after one hour
Mar 11 2024,neutral,watches like an average history channel take on napoleon scenes drag and the cast lacks chemistry
Mar 10 2024,positive,great potential wasted  performances by phoenix and kirby as well as battleaction scenes were as exceptional as expected but the script was unfocused tried to do too much or too little leaving me with no true greater insights into the protagonist  if napoleon was a military genius there was no way for the viewer to appreciate that  so essentially i learnt nothing about napoleon after watching this film intensely
Mar 10 2024,positive,a lesson on expecting too much not the epic i thought it was gonna be very good but not great
Mar 10 2024,negative,i had high hopes but this was disappointing the sets and costuming were interesting to watch but the actingdirecting was some of the blandest ive seen in a while
Mar 9 2024,negative,very disappointing unfortunately its lacking any dramatic impact the battle scenes are as you would expect from ridley scott spectacular but the rest of the film is boring and too long
Mar 9 2024,positive,its good but it is not mind blowing
Mar 9 2024,positive,the movie could explore much more about the life of this man instead they decided to explore his relationship much more definitely passed the time and could be better
Mar 9 2024,negative,boring total lack of energy lackluster sadly at the center of this is joaquin phoenixs performance only its seriousness and epic scale saves it some
Mar 9 2024,positive,cool cannons yo but put the clown makeup back on joaquin
Mar 9 2024,positive,this was much better than i expected  the production and cinematography are excellent  and the battle scenes are really good for a war movie  performances are ok  the accents threw me a bit  rupert everett as the duke of wellington was an unexpected delight  worth watching  35 stars
Mar 9 2024,positive,great acting thought it was entertaining and the cinematography was beautiful
Mar 9 2024,negative,joaquin phoenix has such a lazy performance in this movie not even an attempt at a french accent or voice inflection for that matter napoleons character is so far off of what he is portrayed as in every other media portrayal just a weak meek and awkward man history wise it confuses you more than informs overall i am extremely disappointed that this opportunity was wasted especially disappointed in joaquin phoenix and how unseriously he it seems he took this role
Mar 8 2024,positive,ridley scotts ambitious epic napoleon invites viewers into the tumultuous world of the french emperor chronicling his meteoric rise and heartbreaking fall through the lens of his tumultuous relationship with josephine vanessa kirby shines as josephine adding depth to a character often overshadowed by her husbands legacy     while the film boasts incredible effects that transport audiences into the grandeur of historic battles its not without its flaws joaquin phoenixs portrayal of napoleon while masterful misses the mark in terms of age accuracy pulling some viewers out of the immersive experience the editing unfortunately lacks finesse resulting in pacing issues that detract from the overall impact    despite these shortcomings napoleon still delivers gripping moments particularly in its meticulously crafted battlefield scenes worthy of oscar recognition the impeccable costumes and sets further elevate the production value however with such a rich historical canvas the film feels constrained by its runtime leaving audiences craving more context and depth    in the end napoleon falls short of its potential as a masterpiece hindered by its rushed narrative and casting missteps yet for history enthusiasts and fans of epic dramas it remains an enjoyable and entertaining journey into one of historys most captivating figures
Mar 8 2024,positive,visually stunning as all ridley scott movies but the story seemed to skip about and not flow well
Mar 7 2024,negative,really disappointed in this movie  i know it wasnt a documentary but just bizarre in the story  phoenix seems to portray napoleon as an autistic person for the most part not looking at the person speaking to them and delivering his line in a dead monotone  only when speaking to joesphine does he come off as a lovesick preteen  their entire relationship was really disturbing  it certainly is not portrayed in the way i know it from his biographies  couldnt get through the entire movie just a stinker
Mar 7 2024,negative,i was really excited to watch this movie despite the low rating but then i was surprised at how unenjoyable and even how uninformative it was in fact i stopped half way through because i couldnt bear watching more of it all characters were depicted as unbelievable caricatures to the extent that you cant relate or even understand what theyre thinking or feeling i rarely say dont watch a movie but this one you can really do without watching
Mar 6 2024,positive,first off this was a great movie the battle scenes are extremely well done acting is solid and the story is interesting not sure why everyone is so harsh on this
Mar 6 2024,negative,despite the great actors this movie was tedious and fell flat for me surely his life was much more colorful
Mar 6 2024,negative,poorly executedthe movie feels like it jumps around worse than a kangaroo leaving you wondering what exactly is happeningor if you are still in the same scene as before or years ahead it make it hard to connect with characters or find any depth in the story    battle sequence while beautiful to watch have no set up nor context and so once again you are left wondering what exactly is going on if the viewer isnt aware of napoleons history they are left wondering through the whole movie    napoleons and josaphines relationship feels strange and the viewer never is allow to connect with them overall a poor movie for what it could have been
Mar 6 2024,negative,joaquin phoenix was a bad choice for this movie other than the magnificent battle scenes it was a weird and puzzling waste of time
Mar 6 2024,neutral,great in scope short on history  
Mar 5 2024,negative,a 2hrs 37mins jump cut disaster dispassionately shag josephine cutcut accuses the directory that they have deserted france not him its a disaster a film too big for its boots shoehorned into a size way too small made with what looks like a plot from wikipedia and a script generated via ai it has no sense of time passing energy or even passion which is startling given the narrative arch is built around napoleons obsession for josephine in the siege of toulon napoleon is 24ys old but he is played by joaquin phoenix as if he is 54 monosyllabic tired without any vigour one presumes that no script was written for joaquin and he was trying to fill the screen with something oh but the costumes a sumptuous the art direction is top notch and it looks pretty but it is a shocker  like an amalgamation of 30 second high budget tv commercials edited together but with no product super end board its so bad it made me angry avoid watch the duelists instead  a 5 star film which is ridley before he had a humility bypass and studios had given him to much money
Mar 5 2024,negative,terrible if you want to see a better movie about napoleon with far better sense of scale and grandeur and far better effects watch waterloo from the 1970s with rod steiger as napoleon the battle scenes were nothing like the real battles and ridiculous to picture napoleon as leading charges at waterloo and even the geography was off no reference to napoleons longlasting impact on european law or states and left wondering why they even bothered to make this movie its either been cut dramatically by the studios or it is the worst movie ever made by this director and the worst movie about napoleon some great actors struggling with terrible dialogue and no real understanding of napoleon or other characters of the period truly awful boring in many places and a great lost opportunity
Mar 5 2024,negative,i was gutted to have missed this in the cinema and waited ages for it to appear on apple tv glad i didnt waste my money in the cinema now the film is awful really really bad ridley scotts worst film there are some scenes which are well made so an extra star for that not sure why why people are praising the acting    there is no context to anything and you would need to understand the history of napoleon before watching the film which i i didnt this should probably have been a trilogy or series to better tell the story and add more depth    i fell asleep watching and finished the next day
Mar 5 2024,negative,that was horrible acting 
Mar 5 2024,negative,awful and bloated he speaks in an american accent 
Mar 5 2024,negative,too much musicbad actingdark scene bad lighting
Mar 4 2024,positive,honestly the fact that this has a 58 on rotten tomatoes makes me not want to trust this website ever again napoleon was compelling adventurous and exciting throughout phoenix played the role perfectly and added a sense of unique character to napoleon that made him relatable he showed the fragile child behind napoleons proud shell and yielded an outstanding performance one of my favorites honestly
Mar 4 2024,negative,incredibly disappointing i was fairly excited about this film in the year leading up to its release ridley has made some great movies over the years though also some flops phoenix is a very talented actor the budget was huge and obviously the story is great but something went really wrong here an hour in i was just waiting for the movie to end
Mar 4 2024,negative,terrible i mean if you think frowning and sticking your fingers in your ear to be acting then this might be for you
Mar 4 2024,negative,this story focuses on an autistic mans relationship and how that love interest affects his decision making basically a love story if youve seen the trailer youve seen all of the movie worth watching
Mar 4 2024,negative,okay   i only made it about 30 minutes in when i realized that he wasnt even trying to present historical events in order beyond the easily avoidable historical inaccuracies like not bothering to recreate an accurate guillotine while spending a fortune on other production values theres not enough context given for the events in his lifewhich is how a film becomes an epic     and he appears to be 12 decades older than when he began and could be the father of josephine when she was in fact 6 years older than him its disappointing that ridley scottwho brought thelma and louise to the world usually respects the capacity of female heroines as more than eye candy and must be familiar with geena davis workcould cast an actress in her 40s or rather 50s bc most modern 40something actresses look 30 i couldnt get much farther when i realized it was investment of time i couldnt recover i cleaned the litterbox instead     not sure why ridley scott did this and why hes so defensive about it did this emanate from a dinner party conversation w the actors scott is very talented perhaps the context of scifi where yes there are a set of rules within which a story world must take place but theyre not historical
Mar 4 2024,positive,old school english antipathy for both the french revolution and napoleon bonaparte and honestly im here for it
Mar 4 2024,negative,boring and didnt think acting or plot were interesting at all save 3 hours of your life on a good walk playing with kids or staring at paint dry
Mar 4 2024,negative,moves like molasses on a cold day the dialogue comes out of intro to movie scripting 101 napoleons relationship with josephine is hardly enough to sustain a short anime film much less a long film     riffing on what woody allen said about the novel war and peace the plot is simple napoleon goes off to war josephine takes another lover    
Mar 4 2024,negative,this film had little plotwhat a missed opportunity to create something extraordinary
Mar 4 2024,negative,a hallmarkish movie with good production and accurate costume design
Mar 4 2024,negative,i was extremely excited to watch ridley scott bring the larger than life napoleon to the big screen this was but a waste of a movie and an opportunity the main objective of the film is to bring napoleon down by up playing his controversial love life and barely focusing in his brilliance on the battlefield they measure his life by the amount of deaths he left behind but do not even explain the geopolitical circumstances necessary to understand that he was under constant attack from the very first moment he rose to power and spent his entire life defending his beloved france from england and its allies  not enough words to express my hatred for this picture
Mar 4 2024,positive,the movie is not as bad as i expected but surely has many flaws   it lacks purpose to begin with should it be a deep dive into napoleons psyche should it be a biography a romance it tries to be so much and thus becomes so little   it also becomes difficult to watch the almost 3 hours because it lacks a sense of climax instead it just fast fowards important events
Mar 4 2024,positive,i waited for the movie to be over gave it a chance to redeem itself never came decent watch thought nothing special
Mar 3 2024,negative,one of the most frustrating cinematic experiences ive ever had such potential and failure in one film     i honestly thought at times that scott made this as a parody hes simply trying to humiliate napoleon 200 years later the greatest military mind in history is portrayed as a bumbling and mopying dolt we never get a sense of what napoleon accomplished how the french regarded him why he was driven etc his genius as a general and a statesman is not at all represented in the story as much as i love phoenix his performance was bizarre and a million miles away from the target add to this the blatant historical inaccuracies and odd pace and you have a garbage fire     napoleon was the greatest military mind in history his reforms changed france and the western world all you would know about the man from this movie is that he won a few battles became emporer somehow and was sexually frustrated avoid
Mar 3 2024,negative,very bad movie bad history bad adaptation vas guion terrible
Mar 3 2024,negative,the first act featured solid storytelling and excellent battle sequences i began to understand the man his motivation and his genius before i knew only the name and the portrait     then pacing slowed sequences became repetitive and linear even the burning of moscow felt like it was just thrown in when napoleon asks who did this the answer should have been ridley scott    i expected so much more from this amazing talent
Mar 3 2024,neutral,was  expecting it to be better but some stuff they could have skipped sec scene no need for it
Mar 3 2024,negative,terrible movie phoenix cant act to start with and he was terrible in this turkey  dont waste you money
Mar 3 2024,negative,the historical inaccuracies were extremely disappointing  even facts of napoleons life that are common knowledge were changed by ridley scott for example he was a young man when he rose to power but is played by a 50  year old man  and in fact josephine was 6 years his senior while vanessa kirby plays josephine is more than 15 years younger than joaquin phoenix plays napoleon  the real story is extremely interesting why mess with it   so so so disappointing
Mar 3 2024,negative,i guess i was expecting too much very disappointed
Mar 3 2024,negative,scattered plot acting ok not great  left out the real meat of this historical figure
Mar 3 2024,negative,wish director made his comment dismissing historical inaccuracies before i paid to see    film  i will know better in future when a film made by him is released
Mar 3 2024,negative,the film tries to cover so much time in an event filled life and ends up feeling like a theme park or museum ride through big set scenes interspersed with cringey scenes of napoleon and josephine going at it and napoleon being upset he doesnt have an heir due to josephines looks i was actually reminded of the relationship between spike and drusilla in buffy which was so much more believably acted and engaging napoleon seems emotionless most of the time perhaps to suggest a cool exterior with emotion  raging underneath  but then when he has emotional outbursts they are so unconvincing and weak i was almost embarrassed actors around the lead feel like they are holding back their acting ability so as not to show him up    the big battle scenes are pretty good but napoleon is shown covering his ears while cannon are being fired so many times it begins to feel like the director is showing off that he knows this big historical fact that cannons were louder than you might think      the only time in the whole film i was actually interested was when napoleon retrieved a cannon ball that had slammed into the front of his horse and hands it to someone saying for mother i thought perhaps the film would showcase some weird relationship napoleon had with his mother she was in the film briefly but no
Mar 3 2024,negative,terrible  the writing was horrible the french sounded like the british and the russians sounded like the french horrible acting by tamar rahim    he was worse in this movie then in madame web i can not believe this guy actually lands acting parts very disappointing movie
Mar 3 2024,negative,what a boring mess of a movie phoenix seemed as if he was reading his lines from a cue card while mentally writing his grocery list i know auteur directors dont wanna hear this but people want the hero journey with this kind of movie seeing the guy you are about to follow for nearly 3 hours comically rabbit hump his unlikable wife is not a good start the script was all over the place
Mar 3 2024,negative,a ridley scott movie  with joaquin phoenix cant be bad right wrong
Mar 3 2024,negative,make no mistake joaquin phoenix is a disaster in this role hes totally miscast not in the slightest believable as napoleon in a cast full of actors speaking with a british accent he sticks to an american one most of the time and looks half asleep throughout the film you could grab a random person off the street to do as a good a job as joaquin did here anything good about the film yes the set design some of the battle scenes and most of the other acting is good
Mar 3 2024,negative,poor movie felt more a british movie the horrible horse scene wonders one about the directors fascination of exploding bodies reminds one instantly about alien movie should have been in french at this day and age  seeing the main actor reprising as a here feels more like a redemtpion of his gladiator role
Mar 3 2024,negative,an absolute rambling mess in which its impossible to know who anyone is other than napoleon and josephine there is no clue who napoleon is fighting and why or how he accrues power and no sign of the wonderful performances so many critics have noted  joaquin phoenix in particular looks like he has no more idea what the movie is about than the audience can possibly have  the occasional whacked out smile or sudden bellow does not a character make
Mar 3 2024,neutral,its tough to imagine how two and a half hours could contain less real insight about napoleon bonaparte director ridley scott gladiator makes some interesting choices and its jarring to hear napoleon joaquin phoenix and josephine the wonderful vanessa kirby speaking in american and british accents respectively worthy oscar nominations for production design costume design and visual effects
Mar 2 2024,neutral,the visuals were gorgeous the story was disjointed and sad and long i couldnt figure out why he kept winning and i couldnt figure out who the other characters were and what they were doing and why
Mar 2 2024,positive,this biopic is an aesthetically beautiful piece that moves the audience through the twoandahalfhour runtime at a quick and efficient pace the story emphasizes the human side to a largerthanlife historical figure i felt the first half was superior to the latter half and more development of supporting characters could have fixed that i would still definitely watch this again
Mar 2 2024,negative,very good acting and of course the effects and scale of the film are splendid but ridley scott has ruined it why choose a historical character and then ignore the history why concentrate so much on his battles but almost entirely ignore how he won them overall a waste of the huge budget apple committed
Mar 2 2024,neutral,not organized well 
Mar 2 2024,positive,after seeing the bad critics i expected to see one average film but it was lot better than what i have read loved the whole movie great battles scenes too
Mar 2 2024,negative,a very dull experience ridley scotts latest film napoleon does not deliver on all of the hype leading up to its release what we have here is a very overlong and boring experience when the action kicks in the movie starts to find its footing when the action stops that is when this film falls flat on its face its a shame as the cast is very good here joaquin phoenix is very underwhelming here as napoleon even his accent is all over the place and does not resemble a french accent at all vanessa kirby however really shines as napoleons wife she brings her a game in every scene that she is in i feel bad for vanessa here as this film really wasted away her talents the pros about this film are the visuals and cinematography but thats about it it seems ridley scott has really been in a rather bit of a slump recently one can only hope that he is able to get back to amazing films like alien or gladiator one day napoleon gets a low 2 stars out of 5 from me
Mar 2 2024,negative,awful and the soundtrack  i wonder if ridley scott even read the script before showing up for the first day of shooting or if while doing so he had to rip out some pages to wipe his ass
Mar 2 2024,negative,disappointing to me the movie was slow and not very interesting i also found that the movie did not give me a very good idea of what was going on from a historical perspective
Mar 2 2024,negative,looks great but the story is just garbage a real shame so so so much potential and wasted in a hasty manner  you just cant do a movie about such a giant character and change it in that disgraceful form
Mar 1 2024,negative,the final waterloo scene was good but the rest was hohum
Mar 1 2024,negative,it looked intriguing but failed to explain what was going on just jumping from one war to another storyline then another war never tying them together
Mar 1 2024,negative,what a mess this historical recreation of the life of napoleon is far more fiction than fact further compounded by ridley scotts horrific portrayal of napoleon as a weak fragile emotional stunted man just looking for respect i wont get into the chemistry between napoleon and josephine because there was none as for phoenix himself hes an enigma i dont understand how someone can put on such a masterful performance like he did in the joker only to literally mail in his performance as napoleon i didnt for a single second believe he was napoleon and even worse i never thought for a single second he wanted to be there or have anything to do with this production
Feb 29 2024,negative,the rise and fall of ridley scott
Feb 27 2024,negative,ridley scott should feel deeply ashamed of this lazy piece of cinema such a big budget and such a great character for cinema yet he produces a banal biopic it would have been so much more interesting to focus on perhaps his russian campaign or his time on st helena with flash backs and the british slowly poisoned him trying to cover 20 years just means there is little substance and joaquim who i normally adore just looks like hes taken a sleeping pill such a shame
Feb 25 2024,positive,good stuff beautifully filmed always a fan if mr scott
Feb 25 2024,positive,it was really good and better than i thought it would be mr phoenix did outstanding i have much more respect and admiration for emperor bonaparte than i previously did nevertheless its still for the best that the european coalition won
Feb 25 2024,negative,this film production company falsifies reliable facts in history
Feb 24 2024,negative,a confusing and bizarre film that jumped around with little plot or character development napoleon was such a key part of french and indeed european history and deserves better
Feb 24 2024,positive,ridley scotts epic follows napoleon throughout his life but never feels as if theres a true direction or meaning to the film it has great epic battle scenes amazing actors and an extraordinary director behind the camera but never lives up to whos all involved in the project
Feb 24 2024,positive,this was a pretty good movie not sure why the ratings werent higher
Feb 23 2024,negative,the worst napaleon movie ive ever seen
Feb 21 2024,neutral,napoleon is the war action film that is based on the story of napoleon bonaparte played by joaquin phoenix and the movie is directed by ridley scott the movie also stars vanessa kirby as empress josephine and i think the two best parts about this movie were the acting and how great the action was but this movie has many issues when it comes to pacing using the lengthy runtime wisely to develop these characters and tell their complete stories and the action lacks this thrill factor that would give an emotional or suspenseful presence if done right but the action and story overall misses those marks for a good part of the movie the story drags and this movie reminded me of those history videos that wed watch in school because of how boring and how much this story lacks great substance other than just showing random events that are mostly fiction rather than non i really hoped this movie wouldve been more a character study on this character like oppenheimer did but with more action and emotion into the story overall napoleon is a film based on the life of the historical figure with the events in the film being far from true and the story being all over the place and lacking any emotion which is sacrificed through the bland but very good action and acting napoleon gets a c
Feb 21 2024,positive,it would be nice for ridley scotts historical films to have a warning at the beginning stating that they do not match reality just so as not to misinform people but if you look at it as fiction its fun to watch in technical aspects visual effects sound art direction it is a very well made film i havent seen such good battle scenes in a while and joaquin phoenixs work was also incredible
Feb 20 2024,positive,to long and tedious   spent too much time on dialog and not enough on the action scenes  acting was excellent though
Feb 19 2024,positive,i love ridley scotts work including some recent films of his like the martian all the money in the world and the last duel as for napoleon i went in with fairly high expectations and left disappointed overall as most are saying this is an incredible technical achievement just like with films such as exodus gods and kings prometheus and alien covenant ridley scott gives you visual feasts for your eyes where every frame is literally something you could place on your wall as a painting similarly to the aforementioned examples the story suffers tremendously as a result in this case we get a series of events that only barely connect to one another as if being read from a historical textbook what is missing is what i considered to be the emotional connection to the characters and whats happening to them on a humanistic and relatable level why we should care about napoleons exploits beyond its historical significance i surmise that will all be answered and brought back into the picture in the four hour cut but until then this is what it is
Feb 19 2024,negative,ridley decided to skip the all important task of convincing the viewer that napoleon was an elite general and was respected by the french peopleinstead the majority of the film focused on josephine and felt like a boring episode of days of our lives 
Feb 19 2024,positive,napoleon offers a visually stunning portrayal of the iconic french emperors rise and fall with joaquin phoenix delivering a stellar performance the films battle scenes are a standout showcasing ridley scotts mastery of largescale filmmaking however the pacing falters between these moments leaving some parts feeling tedious despite phoenixs captivating portrayal the story fails to fully engage leaving the film feeling both too long and yet not quite fulfilling
Feb 19 2024,negative,napole yawn boring movie couldnt even finish it disappointed with this movie all around good luck if you choose to watch this this
Feb 18 2024,negative,my 2nd rewatch was both better and worse this feels like a 5 hour movie cut down to 2 and a half hours so many events of napoleons are skipped over and the movies side characters are begging to be explored people will stop appearing and youll never see them again the romance sucks and is lifeless we never see napoleon interacting with citizens yet were supposed to believe hes beloved    joaquin phoenix is still miscast hes trying but he comes off as a boring asshole i really liked that guy with the cane i wish we couldve followed him more
Feb 18 2024,negative,a film about a character that inspired a nation at least make some effort to capture the genius or the ambition or the drama or something anything i could forgive the historical inaccuracies if it did that the film doesnt do any of that and it is simply a wasted opportunity awful
Feb 18 2024,positive,felt like it was very fast paced since it covered a massive time period but overall enjoyed it certain parts felt boring however the battle scenes made up for it     i wouldve enjoyed the movie more if it had focused on a specific time period in napoleonss life personally i think the movie starting around the time of napoleons decline could have been interesting starting it around the end of his russia invasion mission     anyways i dont feel like writing more
Feb 17 2024,negative,it had some cool scenes and some cool camera work but this movie is more about his wife than it is him it kinda sucked 
Feb 17 2024,neutral,while it may boast some quality production values ridley scotts napoleon is a bloated poorly paced confused mess of a film made worse by a confused lead performance from joaquin phoenix
Feb 17 2024,positive,long movie interesting but slow in spots joaquin phoenix is incredible as always
Feb 17 2024,negative,horrible  they couldnt even fake french accents hated it
Feb 16 2024,positive,i went to the movies willing to know why napoleon was such a historical character i left without knowing any further felt like a history channel dramatization without any deepening jut verbatim telling joaquim phoenix is possibly one of the best actors to date but his voice profile definitely does not fit that of a military leader disappointed
Feb 15 2024,negative,25 hours and 20 ill never get back i left without any real knowledge of napoleons life and accomplishments and instead just a portrayal an uncomfortable man and the love for his ex wife so disappointing
Feb 14 2024,negative,despite nice cinematography and good acting the film failed to make good use of a great cast it is way too long considering how little happens and how little it says     napoleon had zero personality or depth we learn nothing about him his motives and personality that we didnt already know from our history teachers it felt like a long slightly more dramatized school history learning video    its a shame to waste the potential of a movie about the iconic figure that napoleon is
Feb 14 2024,negative,80 of the movie is napoleon crying for his wife
Feb 14 2024,negative,surprisingly lacking in action ploddingly slow and overly sexual this movie was an absolute waste of my time
Feb 13 2024,negative,take something like the entire game of thrones series and condense it into 2 hours thats ridley scotts napoleon an extremely rich and interesting true story a great director and actors squeezed into a short movie with too much to tell in too little time napoleon ends up as a weakling with sociopathic traits who came to power by accident the battles are childish josephine is autistic and other important characters are just empty shells passing through the story it can be watched but its not worth paying for it
Feb 13 2024,positive,as a current university student studying history it was really cool seeing what i was learning about in class depicted on screen yes it was dramatized but it was still impressive side note dont make the mistake i made by watching this with my dad there are a lot of awkward sex scenes
Feb 13 2024,positive,this movie wasbrilliant but now i have to explain what i mean by that its not for everyones taste or should i sayperspective because for me i came in this movie with no expectations to just look where it would take me and it for sure did firstly it was comical a lot of the scenes where made for comedic relief and that was unexpected for most of the viewers for me too the visuals were beautifull a lot of good cinematography for the plot line it looked like movie was trying to show diary pages which explains the distraught which is felt in the movie and more on the napoleons personal life which again has to be looked at with a grain of salt this movie felt very artistic and actually funny from confusion and scenes where you cany tell if this was on purpose or not so overall if you want to see truly different historical movie with artistic and comical features something that i think never had been done before you definitely should watch it ps a lot of people said that j phoenix performance was bad in my opinion it definitely wasnt it was just different it felt very good and you could feel every emotion and all the napoleons attributes to it which for the most part werent pleasant or looked great which was the point
Feb 12 2024,negative,the acting was so hammy i thought it was trying to be a comedy zero tension zero depth zero suspense how can the director who made the superb gladiator movie make this terrifying historical figure such a pathetic joker
Feb 12 2024,negative,costumes are great the rest is a hot mess script was insipid soundtrack forgettable and casting bizarre
Feb 11 2024,positive,while having phenomenal set pieces ultimately ends up being a one take cynical and poorly edited take on the life of its protagonist
Feb 11 2024,positive,upbraided for historical inaccuracies this is nevertheless one magnificent handsome production from ridley scott that charters the triumphs and collapses of the titular military commander and his affinity with joséphine bonaparte with astounding sights of the battlefield scenes 
Feb 11 2024,positive,its entertaining for sure however the movie leaves some in my opinion important parts out and focuses on more unimportant things instead
Feb 11 2024,negative,great special effects lousy script that ruined what should have been a great movie
Feb 10 2024,negative,this is just plainly wrong from the historical facts to just very basically napoleons age he was just a 24 years old military genius and nothing needed to be said deed to his battlefield genius  best of all times with maybe alexander the great as contender really and hes portrayed as an illuminated 56 years old sex obsessed character   its just an insult   and its just one out of so many historical inaccuracies in just 10mn of film   and its not even speaking about the awful bad diserespfio and purely just garbage acting
Feb 9 2024,negative,i struggled to watch this one in 2024 why oh why are we still appropriating a culture and not speaking french  or at the very least with a french accent i didnt know who was french british or american well there should be no americans smh that is all i could think about the only scene that gripped me was the nonverbal one between josephine and napoleon i left with an incomplete picture of napoleon i expected incandescent rage and short man syndrome and a clearer transition of events sticking cursive titles and dates in the movie means nothing if you have no historical knowledge of the time i had studied some of the french revolution but napoleons position within it and out of it was not made very clear there were threads but they werent woven together i guess that comes down to editing and storytelling because the elements were there
Feb 8 2024,positive,this was a great film to watch with so much documented and available history some stuff had to be left out the pivotal battle of the nile was mentioned but not expanded the military details overall were excellent and the main characters well portrayed and explained sets were magnificent   well worth a watch
Feb 7 2024,negative,a gross disappointment  beyond any particular criticism of the poor acting and battle staging the movie was boring  how could the director succeed in making such a big budget film have the appearance of a low budget effort
Feb 6 2024,positive,ridley knows what hes doing especially in an epic when it comes to battle scenes i think we have been spoiled by the battle of the bastards in game of thrones or zulu this has glimpses of that claustrophobic organised chaos feel but doesnt deliver in the same way i really enjoyed the relationship between napoleon and josephine and ridley explores this wonderfully final footnote is its a bit too long which is the same as killers of the flower moon both apple production were they both filmed for streaming rather than theatrical viewing
Feb 6 2024,negative,napoleon was a great leader energetic brave i cant watch what they did with his personality    everyone who knows history just a little should understand what a distortion this film is
Feb 6 2024,negative,i feel like i know less about napoleon now
Feb 5 2024,positive,i liked napoleon the acting was excellent the battle scenes excellent and the story line very good not in the same category of gladiator or kingdom of heaven those are both masterpieces napoleon rates more in the category for the last duel and exodus of kings and gods a good movie that people who enjoy history will like
Feb 5 2024,negative,the movie was poorly conceived and lacks depth and conviction that wins over the audience  the main character was mis cast  i expected better from a scott movie
Feb 5 2024,negative,didnt explain or show napoleons situation well enough or what was going on good enough cant wait for a better movie 
Feb 5 2024,positive,the problem with rss movies is that we come to watch them with high expectations big problem actually rs belongs to the tier one masterpieces masterminds would this movie come from any director out of this class id rate it 5 stars otherwise its a tossup  each one of rss movies follows a very strict pattern which is the main reason why we so easily get addicted to them first the storyline is a crystal clear string easy to follow from the beginning to the end like even when you think its drifting away its not and actually its part of the plot then almost all of the scenes are extremely tense be it action or romance youre glued to the screen which actually is riddley scotts typical signature  it is virtually impossible to get distracted and last but not least which is the mark of masterpieces the movie can be watched each time with a different perspective  napoleon misses the three and god it was so painful to witness it  about historical accuracy napoleon is not a historical documentary guys i personally avoid documentaries because books are 1000 times better and never claimed to be so it is a tour inside napoleons mind during his fantastic fateful journey as frances leader nothing else  the movie is worth the money spent no question but as an rs one its a miss sorry to say that mr scott
Feb 4 2024,negative,pretty pretty pretty pretty mediocre
Feb 4 2024,positive,napoleon offers a solid historical war drama though it falls short of reaching the pinnacle set by ridley scotts previous masterpieces like gladiator while it delivers a compelling narrative set against the backdrop of history with impressive battle sequences and period detail it lacks the same level of emotional resonance and storytelling finesse nonetheless it remains a worthwhile watch for fans of historical epics
Feb 4 2024,positive,fascinating gist storyline of napoleons rule and life the movie has some personable moments but mostly just rise reign and fall of power worth the watch and learn some things
Feb 4 2024,positive,although i enjoyed learning about napoleon i felt myself wanting more  there were so many things that couldve been included to make it more interesting  instead they focused on a dramatized bizarre love affair with josephine that was modernized in a way that wasnt necessary  sadly they also threw in some curse words unnecessarily  props for trying to take on such a complex and odd subject  i also appreciated some of the military strategy thats what really interested me  we bought it on amazon
Feb 4 2024,positive,i enjoyed it plenty of great action scenes and an interesting storyline which includes romance war and his rise to power and fall from it interesting and worth watching
Feb 3 2024,negative,americanized napoleon petty insecure and masculinity issues and wasnt he short this movie is more about his relationship with josephine than about his real self a big fail for it could be a great biopic about one of the most famous emperor even if it was a romance the characters didnt entirely express their love they looked more like emotionless puppets moved by ridley scott
Feb 3 2024,neutral,honestly disappointed movie fell flat of expectations
Feb 2 2024,negative,this movie was very hard to watch i had to hold back from turning it off multiple times the acting was cringe worthy at best and uncomfortable to watch the scenes were useless sporadic and abrupt the historical accuracy was sadly amiss    i do not recommend this movie as a war epic or a historical biography this movie is trash
Feb 2 2024,positive,honestly thought this was not gonna be as good as im not a person to watch historical movies but this had its hilarious moments and felt like you were on the edge most times 
Feb 1 2024,negative,this is a mehpoleon
Feb 1 2024,positive,great attempt at showing the imperialistic ambitions of napoleon however despite the fantastic battle scenes depicted the rest of the movie tends to jump around a bit and is not woven together as to bring napoleons entire narrative into a seamless piece this in spite of the movie being roughly 2 hours  40 minutes long     on a related note i am curious to see how ridley scotts directors cut version of the film plays out with its rumored nearly 4 hour length perhaps the story can be told in a much more comprehensive manner
Feb 1 2024,positive,napoleon under the masterful direction of ridley scott is presented as a dazzling visual spectacle that precisely captivates the majesty of the napoleonic era cinematography is an undeniable triumph with masterful compositions that elevate each scene and an attention to detail that immerses the viewer in nineteenthcentury france in a striking way    the visual effects are impressive especially in the intense battle scenes where the fusion of modern technology with historical aesthetics is executed in a masterful way although the casting shines in several interpretations the length of the plot sometimes dilutes the emotional impact of key characters    ridley scott demonstrates his mastery as a director especially in the orchestration of epic sequences however the length of the narrative can challenge the audience and some moments lose strength in the breadth of the story the final act without revealing details offers intriguing twists although its hasty execution affects the general cohesion    in conclusion napoleon stands as a visually impressive cinematographic achievement although the emotional impact is sometimes compromised by the narrative complexity
Jan 31 2024,negative,ridley scott the guy who directed napoleon 2023 should really watch the movies gladiator 2000 and kingdom of heaven 2005 to learn how to make a historical epic movie    the movie is just a jumbled mess of nonsensical scenes all strung together without any regard for how each scene justifies the next  theres no sense of story at all just a bunch of stuff that happens to characters that we are literally never introduced to and therefore never actually care about  its almost like you have to be a historical scholar in the life on napoleon first in order to get any sense of the movie  oh judging by the cannonry setup this must be when he defeats the armies of czar nicholas is what someone versed in history would say  however in the context of the movie the only thing you know is joaquin phoenix is in the woods  you dont know the woods are in russia  you dont know who hes fighting  you have no idea what year it is so theres no subtle unspoken foreshadowing that a true historical epic should rely on because the people who see it are generally aware of how everything turns out  none of that  then the scene ends and hes somewhere else and they never mention it again nor is the next scene the logical extension of the prior one  its like watching saturday night live except instead of a comedy its a drama sketchaction and you only know when one vignette ends and another begins because the plot is different but the actors remained the same
Jan 29 2024,positive,the movie was great overall
Jan 29 2024,positive,surprisingly good good acting and directing
Jan 28 2024,positive,this was an excellent movie it is definitely not meant for dummies who like good vs bad guy type movies joaquin did an excellent job at portraying napoleon as a brilliant leader and military strategist but also a flawed man full of complexes who aches for recognition and love the story was captivating and did a great job at capturing napoleons true character incredibly picturesque as well this movie explores complex aspects of human nature and you wont like it if you expect a bunch of battle scenes and toughness go watch reacher for that lol
Jan 28 2024,negative,attempt too turn a historical figure into comedic version the film is too long which is strange as the story seems very rushed phoenix plays the role like a substandard small town pantomime villain
Jan 28 2024,positive,imagine if bill murray was napoleon bonaparte now add a confusing love interest and some cool battle scenes
Jan 28 2024,positive,i am surprised why the ratings are so low this movie is a magnificent historical piece i am most impressed with the cinematography and the costume and set design i think the story was well told and very nicely paced acting was phenomenal
Jan 27 2024,positive,a great summary of napoleon in 25 hours visually spectacular great performance from joaquin phoenix
Jan 27 2024,negative,one of the worst most boring movie i have seen in yearsa total waste of money whoever wrote the script for this movie might want to seek another line of work  ugh
Jan 26 2024,negative,this movie was a general disappointment on many levels first the actin was subpar the storyline was clunky im a big fan of juoaquin pheoenix but this may be one of his worst films yet
Jan 26 2024,negative,it wasnt worth watching
Jan 26 2024,negative,not the epic movie it wants to be firstly the film was clumsy and lazy outside of the battle scenes the rest of the film meandered from one empty scene to another joaquin phoenixs acting seemed to be trapped between his joker persona and a cheap mumbling marlon brandoesque character  and vanessa kirby seemed to be playing a lifeless dull extended version of princess margaret the crown then on to poor rupert everett who was horribly miscast the problem with mr everett is that he has this idea of what being an actor is in his case a foppish posh charming actor who trades on his looks he devotes so much effort to portraying himself as how one should he as an actor that his acting range is stunted beyond that point he couldnt act  if his life depended on it worse still wellington was 45 everett was 64 and looks 74 together everett phoenix and kirbys acting was yuk just because its a long film it doesnt make it epic this was a bad move for ridley scott and maybe european history is not his forte the open views of the sets look a bit phoney and fake the fields and rows of soldiers looked obviously cgi and too theatrelike especially the coronation it maybe entertaining to watch but its not worth remembering its certainly not oscar worthy leaving out the historical inaccuracies many scenes were hollow pointless lazy and uninteresting i think ridley scott must have thought of the battle scenes and nothing beyond that interesting to watch but its nothing wildly amazing as it is hyped out to be just because this is done over as an epic and money was spent on it there are far better more accurate napoleon movies out there
Jan 26 2024,negative,a rare feat of being both brutal history and terribly boring if youre going to throw out any desire to be true to history youd think that should free to make it entertaining the character portrayed isnt anything like the historical figure that countless historians have wrote about but i guess the octogenarian director knows better
Jan 25 2024,negative,sketchy jumpy for people like me who didnt know much about napoleon apart from his iconic name in essence a love story between him and josephine might be one of the worst films ridley scott ever made
Jan 25 2024,negative,nah it was below zero
Jan 25 2024,positive,joaquin is brilliant as always the storyline is engaging although drifts towards the end i would have liked to have a more of his melancholy post josephines departure nevertheless a good watch
Jan 25 2024,positive,absolutely brilliant and breathtaking film
Jan 24 2024,negative,what a load of hyped rubbish    the dialogue is of poor qualitymuffled    loads of action doesnt make a good film
Jan 24 2024,negative,i would rate it less that 1 if possible  what a complete messcompletely unwatchable
Jan 23 2024,negative,i would rate it less than one if i could first time i walked out of a movie
Jan 23 2024,positive,the best part of the film were the sets the battle scenes were to few and too short  i dont want to blame joaquin phoenix for that character he was portraying i blame the director i also think it was a poorly written part napoleon was portrayed as a creep and not much more vanessa  kirby was magnificent in her role she was just overshadowed by a mediocre story 
Jan 23 2024,negative,although with good performance from vanessa kirby and joaquin phoenix the movies does not shows half of the success andor defeats from napoleon also it does not mention sufficient information about napoleon and his battles with uk spain and portugal
Jan 22 2024,positive,ridley scott never disappoint great acting from joaquin  idk how much cgi was used or if any at all but it looked great
Jan 22 2024,negative,kirby runs away with this comedy
Jan 22 2024,positive,random snippets of napoleons life  i wanted to like to movie but was put off immediately when a haggard 49 year old joaquin phoenix shows up as a 24 year old napoleon  you dont have to be a historian to know that young napoleon must have been brilliant and charismatic to be made brigadier general by the age to 24  then joaquin shuffles grunts and fumbles his way roboticly through the next 25 years of napoleons life and we get almost no sense of why the french followed him so passionately he brought law and order and economic growth to post revolutionary france the real napoleon was savvy charismatic loquacious and funny of course  and when things turned against him we are given no background as to why he blundered into russia czar alexander betrayal why the french were willing to take him back the allies tried to roll back the entire french revolution or his failure at waterloo to follow his own successful military dictates concentrate forces with lightening attacks at weakness one might say such sweeping historical stories are hard to tell but many other epic stories have been done successfully perhaps if we have been allowed to listen into more conversations between napoleon and his advisors we might have had the needed context  the love story between josephine and napoleon that was the central part of the movie was clinical and again without context  there had to be more to it than we were shown
Jan 22 2024,negative,absolutely dreadful i couldnt wait until it would end i would have left after 45 minutes but i was with girlfriend and was worried she was enjoying it and i didnt want to ruin experience towards the end she said she hated the movie i should have left
Jan 22 2024,positive,well shot movie just a little slow paced for me
Jan 22 2024,positive,slow at times but a far better movie than critics make it out to be you will like it if you like this kind of movie
Jan 22 2024,neutral,the movie wasnt bad but it felt like it was written by someone who hated him if you read about napoleon he introduced several improvements to society that are not even mentioned in the movie he was no more a tyrant than the british
Jan 21 2024,negative,very poor film and very poor reflection of who napoleon was nothing about his corsican background only saving grace was the actress playing josephine ridley scott needs to learn a bit of history before taking on films like this very shoddy film this kind of film should also be in french with english subtitles
Jan 21 2024,negative,its a dissaster has 1 historical accuracy bad dialogues i dont even want to continue total failure and dissapointment
Jan 21 2024,positive,i enjoyed very much the movie
Jan 21 2024,negative,comes across more like a poor mans bbc historical drama than a ridley scott epic awful waste of a great cast and subject
Jan 21 2024,negative,poor casting  sloppy directing makes a really difficult watch
Jan 21 2024,positive,its a bythenumbers story with very little emotional complexity to draw the viewer in
Jan 21 2024,negative,im a huge napoleonic era nut and im not going to be able to offer detail as to why the film is so poor a bitter bitter disappointment youve been handed the components for a faberge eggand youve built a toilet brush 
Jan 21 2024,negative,well its not appalling but its far from great  its quality doesnt justify the runtime   didnt learn much new about napoleon or the historical context   couldnt really understand why napoleon fell for  stuck with this josephine  who might have been made to look and seem more attractive  dont think joaquim phoenix captured the intensity and charisma of the man at all well either  high nodoff potential    the only part of this movie to engage me fully was the few minutes of the battle of austerlitz in the snow  if offered my money back id take it  i dont understand why this movie needed to be made at all
Jan 21 2024,negative,yikes not your typical ridley scott movie the character development especially between napoleon and his wife was just plain bad joaquin phoenix being cast as a french emperor was also questionable in this movie he doesnt even try a fake accent at least in gladiator he faked a greekeuropean accent a french emperor speaking in perfect american english is completely unconvincing but the two stars are for the epic and beautiful battle scenescostumes which is exactly what ridley scott always provides
Jan 21 2024,negative,do not waste your money on seeing napoleon  i must assume ridley scott has had a stroke  mr scott was a genius not no mo  the movie napoleon is one of the worst and absurdly written just stupid dialog and edited movies ive ever seen i couldnt watch anymore after 15 hours and there was 2 more hours to go do not waste your money sorry ridley i think you must be abandone to st helena island as napoleon was if the gladiator 2 is as horrible as napoleon is you will not be coming back from st helena time to take a walk away and write a book or something like that    ps you owe a huge apology to joakim for believing in your past successes as he now looks and seems to be a joke
Jan 21 2024,negative,very disappointed because of casting script director editing and lack of correct historical facts waste of time and money on my worst ever movies 
Jan 20 2024,positive,napoleon offers a dramatic portrayal of the iconic french leaders rise to power with joaquin phoenix delivering a compelling performance as napoleon bonaparte the films stylized battle scenes are intense and graphic depicting the brutality of war though some viewers may find them unsettling vanessa kirbys portrayal of josephine adds depth to the narrative highlighting the complexities of their relationship however the films depiction of napoleon as a ruthless conqueror with little regard for human life may be offputting to some additionally scenes of sexual exploitation and strong language contribute to the films mature content while napoleon showcases impressive performances and historical significance its graphic nature may not appeal to all audiences
Jan 20 2024,neutral,for a spectacle filled action epic is a weird way to say overly goofy
Jan 20 2024,negative,this film is all over the place napoleon was a strategic military genius an iconic hero for the french people in this film his character is an insecure childish  stubborn moody emotionally instabile dude the script story scenario are simply insulting   probably the french people are fuming seeing their emperor transformed in a clown  what a waste of time
Jan 20 2024,negative,how does a director as talented as ridley scott and an actor as talented as joachin phoenix make a man like napoleon so dull i dunno its a mystery
Jan 20 2024,negative,they managed to find almost 15 minutes in this almost 3 hour movie to talk about one of historys greatest tacticians time at war maybe one minute of dialogue about that tactical prowess
Jan 20 2024,negative,let me start by saying a small part of me died as the apple original films logo appeared upon the silver screen of the senator theater maybe this is just my first iteration of old man yells at cloud but it was genuinely disheartening to start the night with a casual reminder of the somewhat recent shifts in this industry which in my opinion encourage the audience to forego the theater experience altogether    anyway    despite my small bias i swear to you i went into this movie wideeyed and hopeful i was eager to lose myself in the epic scale of this seasons big budget big name blockbuster unfortunately this film much like its titular character comes up short    the production suffers from an inconsistent scope wherein some scenes feel larger than life while others fall flat in their execution napoleons campaign to egypt for example feels out of place in the same film that delivers overly reductive and unreliable depictions of so many of his later exploits regarding the battles the widely circulated lake maneuver from the trailer feels like the only fully envisioned sequence in the movie so many engagements felt more akin to civil war reenactment hobbyists in atmosphere and quality    i initially enjoyed the effort to demystify the legend of the man but gradually his petty grievances and meager motivations felt difficult to reconcile with the very basic knowledge of world history ive retained since grade school moreover the events of his life unfold so rapidly on screen its hard to present them with any kind of depth for the films characters to settle into    i dont want to say theres nothing redeemable about the picture for one thing i cant hate a movie that opens with a guillotine and im not one for period pieces but ill be damned if i dont love his collection of silly hats throughout the movie theres just nothing holding it all together    i will say the first twenty minutes or so are far better than the hours that follow joaquin phoenix really sells the probable anxiety of napoleons preliminary schemes the delightful savagery that punctuates the brief if not odd encounters in that first half hour give you something to invest in but as the film continues any sense of scope or structure give way to a chaotic scramble of underdeveloped plot points theres no connective tissue to support a clear progression of story elements its like a network of subway stations with no tracks laid between them the lions share of historical placement rests on a series of captions that accompany the rapidly shifting scenery to establish the idea of a timeline in lieu of an organic narrative    at times it reads almost like a highlight reel or blooper reel for that matter rather than the biopic its marketed to be theres so little substance or consequence to be found in these scattered fragments of pseudo historic melodrama the secondary players labor to present an authentic backdrop but the primary cast trample through it like excitable children the characters themselves feel so out of sync with their own sense of purpose or desire from moment to moment they become entirely different animals    after the first hour of scene after scene flashing before my eyes i gave up on trying to keep track of anyones circumstances or intentions by the second hour i began to get that feeling of having binge watched too many seasons of bad reality show it all just kind of blurs together and youre left anxious for the finale so you can shut it off and move on with your life    theres not much to enjoy from the experience until you resign yourself to the realization that it plays far better as an irreverent comedy with no real purchase on world history or perhaps a cautionary tale about simping too hard    all in all i feel as though my already tenuous grasp of french history is far looser now than it had been prior if youre looking for a more believable depiction of the man you might have better luck with bill and teds excellent adventure
Jan 20 2024,neutral,im not sure what they were trying to say about napoleon the movie looks expensive but does very little to justify its hefty price tag
Jan 20 2024,negative,the acting especially joaquin phoenix and vanessa kirby was excellent sadly their performances were wasted by a poorly constructed storyline and direction ridley scotts strength is action centric films vs story centric films he misses badly in this one this is difficult to watch because the storyline is so thin i put the historical inaccuracies aside and viewed this as a fictional story and still believe lacked a central narrative the love story of napoleon and josephine was only a veneer when it could have been so much more
Jan 20 2024,negative,was expecting a historical war epicseemed like the director was trying to prove some sort of point not surprised to see this film get panned by historians  awful piece of storytelling
Jan 20 2024,negative,joaquin phoenixs version of napoleon makes absolutely no sense he plays him like a shy awkward guy with zero charisma yet after a completely lackluster speech he somehow convinced the french army to take him back historical inaccuracies aside its still a terrible movie
Jan 19 2024,positive,was not sure i would like this version of napoleon but joaquin phoenix is a very talented actor and one of my favorites while it may not have reached the scope of the former french emperors heights it was a great watch and beautifully shot the battle scenes were equally well done as was the timeline of french revolutionary events and i would recommend the film for someone who enjoys history for the  storytelling aspect 5 stars in my book
Jan 19 2024,positive,i thought that the main characters were poorly developed and never engaged the audience with their struggles  i dont think that the gratuitous sex added to the story  events in the story seemed disjointed rather than connected  without the time and place subtitles the audience would have been totally lost    i enjoyed the grand scale of the movie in the tradition of ben hur and el cid  the costumes and scenery were beautiful and the battles were exciting  overall the acting was good but not memorable or compelling  the movie did make me think about the parallels between napoleons time and trump in modern time  it also made me want to learn more about napoleon
Jan 19 2024,positive,while some parts of history may be contradictory the aspect related to the movie should be  excellent 
Jan 19 2024,positive,a movie about napoleon had so much potential but to us this movie was like watching an expensive national geographic documentary about napoleon with just a series of events throughout time without getting a connection with the film and the story there was not once that they went indepth     missed opportunity if you ask me
Jan 19 2024,negative,who knew ridley scott could make napoleon such a snooze fest there was little to no chemistry between joaquin phoenix and vanessa kirby given the formidable skill of these actors i assume this was due to poor direction i cant imagine anyone torturing themselves with the even longer directors cut
Jan 19 2024,negative,shockingly bad horrible acting and writing zero plot nonexistent
Jan 19 2024,positive,movies like this  gladiator keep cinema alive
Jan 18 2024,negative,terrible movie not worth a dollar much better to watch random clips of thomas shelby has more to do with actual napoleon
Jan 18 2024,negative,the acting was some of the worst i have ever seen almost as bad as the writing it seemed as joaquin was playing the joker that was playing napoleon
Jan 18 2024,positive,lovely interesting great battle scenes maybe a bit to old phoenix and he plays him a bit weird but interesting lovely female actress
Jan 17 2024,positive,great acting excellent color and photography a little long and sometines it gets boring
Jan 17 2024,negative,come on there were so many ways to make it right the battle at waterloo was a joke clearly the director was not interested in history and thus the movie become pointless
Jan 17 2024,positive,not particularly accurate but fun little drawn out
Jan 17 2024,negative,it should have been called josephine love story as that was what it was actually about with brief clips about the thief of europe conquering most of the continent and fighting the british for 16 years  he then got the finale well what should have been the finale  the battle of waterloo  all wrong if you watch this expecting to see a film about napoleon you will be irritated and disappointed
Jan 17 2024,negative,the lack of character building to start this film is its biggest downfall launching instantly into the moments after the revolution and the fast tracking straight to the battle of toulon this was a man had a known temper and was an outcast growing up as a corsican amongst the french aristocracy there was so much more that could have been told in a much better paced way if you like explosions and nudity then this is a film for you if you like substance in a film then look elsewhere
Jan 17 2024,negative,this film didnt know what it wanted to be the premise is great and has all the hallmarks of an awesome film but its hard to keep up with what the film is portraying itself as is it a comedy a serious drama its odd
Jan 17 2024,negative,its was not enough about napoleon they focused on the relationship with josephine  lost interest in it
Jan 17 2024,neutral,disappointing  a simplistic portrayal of napoleon that makes him out to be a simple brute  dont bother
Jan 17 2024,negative,its a very poor film  instead of trying to portray a complex portrait of napoleon it seesaws back and forth between his military triumphs and his shocking ineptitude in romance  an odd collection of set pieces that dont fit together in any artistic way
Jan 17 2024,negative,ridiculous representation of napoleon lame storyline two stars for some of the battle scenes and photography everything else is really bad
Jan 17 2024,negative,horrible movie  war scenes were ok
Jan 16 2024,negative,if you are looking for a good movie about napoleon move along  no amount of sex scenes or special effects and gore can save this trainwreck
Jan 16 2024,neutral,this is a comedy film
Jan 16 2024,negative,50 shades of napoleon
Jan 16 2024,positive,one of the greatest military tacticians of all time is depicted as a petty infantile weirdo virtually no justice is done to any of his accomplishments very disappointing despite decent performances by actors would not recommend
Jan 16 2024,negative,an absolute disaster its so choppy  68 scenes from the life of napoleon and none of them last longer than 5 minutes historical inaccuracies napoleon played to be a french version of rain man hes aloof weird and unhappy all the time its just awful
Jan 16 2024,negative,what an astounding feat to take a fascinating subject talented cast and huge budget to produce an utterly forgettable flop so disappointed 
Jan 15 2024,negative,what a miss i was dying to see this movie  ridley managed to depict one of the greatest military strategists ever known and a leader that has changed the course of history by his exploits to a ridiculed and merely interesting egotistical character    how can you make fun of a man that dedicated his entire life to his country and people he was driven by the love for his country to make the greatest empire the world has even known regardless of his nationality and the country he worships that in itself commands respect      i feel sorry for phoenix it could have been his greatest performance had him had the right and accurate script about napoleon
Jan 15 2024,negative,i really wanted to like this film even though i had heard about the problems beforehand since i like history and romantic dramas i didnt mind it being centred around his personal life but the film didnt manage that either the whole film feels like a waste of potential especially with such a talented cast i was particularly disappointed to discover that nearly every scene relied heavily on cgi im usually not one to complain about this but when a director claims the movie is almost entirely made with partical effects and then employs it for every scene even the ones that could easily be handled by actors it leaves bad taste in my mouth i also really hope that the vfx artists were not overworked
Jan 15 2024,negative,despite the global atmosphere that bring you straight to the heart of the first empire and the difficult relation between napoleon and josephine this movie is streched appart an historical background way to difficult to pay its respect in two hours and the clear will of the realisator to turn the historical character to a little clown    the film cultivate historical inexactitude pushing the whole film into a cliché and finishing its pitch with a dead count while the whole purpose of the film was the relation between josephine and napoleon    ridley has shown what great film can be he just showed here how bad they can as well
Jan 15 2024,negative,it feels like movie without purpose it is no story telling no book behind snaps are not getting deeper you into epoque actions are simplified and heros without reflections on what happening unnecessary blood scenes average made on all levels using famous person on title
Jan 15 2024,neutral,not what i expected others say too long its not that its too long if a film is fantastic legnth dosent matter what got me was it said a lot without actually saying anything it may as well been called napoleon and his bird and a few short battles one thing i learned is napoleon liked doggy style
Jan 15 2024,positive,definitely received to much hate not a bad movie at all 
Jan 15 2024,negative,a really bad representation of the historical figure of napoléon his history is rich enough not to need changing the place given to joséphine is too large and she is already dead when napoléon leaves elba
Jan 15 2024,negative,i would like nothing more than to get my money back for watching this movie kind of feels like a robbery
Jan 15 2024,neutral,a series of snap shots across a long life which fails to connect them sufficiently i didnt get to feel any emotional connection to the characters
Jan 15 2024,negative,sorry i went nothing redeemable about this movie at all
Jan 15 2024,negative,one word boring its like having all the right ingredients yet cooking up something indigestible
Jan 15 2024,negative,the costumes were outstanding the movie was too long dark and unnecessarily crude at times thumbs down
Jan 15 2024,positive,epic movie a classic ridley scott picture looked fantastic but other than the battle scenes the movie was slow moving the characters lacked depth and i didnt love most of the casting joaquin phoenix was good but i feel like there could have been a better actor for the role
Jan 14 2024,neutral,despite the insanely talanted cast fantastic director and huge budget its a lifeless heartless and unsatisfying movie disappointing 
Jan 14 2024,positive,a great movie ridlle scott is an amazing director dont get me worng but to much jhosephine i wanted more of the napoleon that conquer half of europe   sorry enlighs not natural language  still really great movie much watch
Jan 14 2024,negative,choppy editing so many pointless scenes of his relationship with josephine grand battle settings basic and underutilised  and napoleon with an intermittently brazen american accent just made it impossible to not see joaquin phoenix instead of old boney  i would tell my 3 hours younger self to not bother watching
Jan 14 2024,negative,i was very excited to view this movie it was not very exciting to watch as a fan of napoleons story i found him uninspiring they seemed to capture his worse traits and none of his great traits
Jan 14 2024,negative,for a movie based on a french emperor not a lick of french was spoken not even any accents plus they missed the part in 1801 when he sent his brother in law to invade haiti
Jan 14 2024,negative,disappointing  one pointless battle after another  why were these battles faught no explanation just that they were the enemy  this is one poorly written movie  it offers no real insight into napoleon  hes betrayed as a petulant monosyllabic  fat old man no way such a character could inspire a nation and dominate europe
Jan 14 2024,positive,i hoped it would have been better saw it in imax should have watched as a rental
Jan 14 2024,negative,there wasnt much good to say about this movie yes they had some interesting looking scenes but everything else lacked it was boring actors were constipated and just plain dull its been a long time since i wanted to run out of a theater halfway through a movie
Jan 14 2024,neutral,i was disappointed with this film it was more of a romance film than a drama  the story was very slow in places  the battle scenes were very over simplified and felt disjointed from the flow of the film
Jan 14 2024,positive,mauro lanari   having completed the writing of the phenomenology of the spirit to which he would add the preface the following year on 13 october 1806 in johannisstraße at jena hegel sees napoleon on horseback and in a letter to his theologian friend niethammer defines him as an individual in whom the history of the world that he wonderfully dominates is concentrated the equiparation with ones own manuscript is implied ridley scott shows us the course through the eyes of hegel but no longer the one of 1806 but rather the one of the lectures on the philosophy of history published posthumously in 1837 when his system is collapsed and in the preface history is assimilated to a slaughterbench once this is understood every single scene makes sense the movie is not a biopic since it is exclusively interested in representing the human substantial impotence sterility you are spoiled for choice between the decapitation of marie antoinette at the beginning and the list of deaths in the closing credits from the defeat in love to the horse taken from picassos guernica and to phoenix in front of the sarcophagus that opens the future emperor in front of a probable pharaoh the reluctance of the hubris to touch a heap of biblical dust genesis 319 the conclusive encounter with everett in plymouth on the hms bellerophon shot with a wide angle and placed in a cabin with a checkered floor is a tribute to the preending of 2001 and in the exile at st helena the fragility symbolized by bowmans falling glass is rendered by the fly in the red wine this is how scott tries to make the napoleon that kubrick had planned after the success of 2001 lets not forget that the two filmmakers already had the opportunity to collaborate when the epilogue of blade runner was modified using the scraps of the shining from two years earlier perhaps the english directors best autonomous film what would alien be without gigers monstrosities or blade runner without dicks novel but on the same subject still distant from the maniacal perfectionism of welles the first greenaway and precisely kubrick for those looking for the grandeur of bonaparte there is already abel gances film with polyvision
Jan 14 2024,negative,this is the worst movie ridley scott has made
Jan 14 2024,neutral,not nearly what i expected but it had some interesting parts that tried to keep me engaged i couldnt really grasp the full feeling of this movie but it will at least try to keep you watching with its high quality production
Jan 14 2024,negative,indescribably disappointing expected so much more of joaquin phoenix but his magic seems to have gone all he did was whisper and wheeze throughout the film how could someone write such a boring script about napoleon
Jan 14 2024,negative,i was extremely disappointed by this movie as a history buff this movie is completely lacking when it comes to explaining the importance of a man who shaped world history as we know it the cinematography was mediocre and lacking the epic vibe befitting of a historical figure that of napoleons importance instead what you have here is an uninspiring shell of a story about a man who is portrayed more of a cuck failure than a man who nearly conquered the world as for the acting joaquin phoenix is usually phenomenal but his performance in this movie felt more as if he only showed up to collect the paycheck and as for mr scott i have no idea what he was trying to do with this movie unless his intention was to assassinate napoleons character easily one of his worst movies 
Jan 14 2024,positive,history is what happened people cant change it
Jan 14 2024,negative,wow this movie was a complete stinker littered with historical inaccuracies terrible acting terrible writing very little focus on napoleons military genius check out epic history tv on youtube if you want some a napoleon content
Jan 14 2024,negative,sad to say boring and told more like a bio and not cinematic story telling
Jan 14 2024,positive,this was a great movie that was just following historical timelines they had to past years because they had to get the good parts into about 25 hours im still surprised after the first time i watched this i loved the battle of austerlitz part in my opinion this deserves a high rating because it shows history and for me its really helpful for my history classes
Jan 14 2024,negative,cinematography  set design is well done but napoleon portaryed as a moody teathre kid bafoon bumbling around historical inaccuracies got tiresome quick
Jan 14 2024,positive,battle sequences were very entertaining the other aspects of the movie were less than inspiring
Jan 14 2024,negative,napoléon gave france the civil code still used today he created lacadémie française completely reorganized the french education system he was one of the most gifted artillery military cadet brilliant in maths yet scott  depicts him has a brut warrior obsessed with sex sorry never base your opinion of napoleon from the british the movie was too long but not long enough to fit napoleons life
Jan 14 2024,negative,i was looking forward to seeing despite the wide negativity well i didnt walk away happy to see it this movie suffered from 2 major issues for me first that was just too much history to covered in 2 12 hours especially when much of that time was dedicated to his love life im sure many people if they had no prior knowledge of napolean would walk away from this movie confused as to why he is considered such an important historical figure this movie does an extremely poor job showing why napoleon was so important to france in this movie he just comes off as a weird dude who did a few things this movie completely misses the mark on conveying napoleons importance to history second while i like phoenix in previous acting roles this role did not fit him at all he looked the part but as soon as he would begin talking man it takes you right out the movie often times it felt phoenix was just phoning it in and reading directly off the script but i cant imagine he wouldnt have put in some effort for this role how could anyone in casting see him read lines for this and go yeah thats our napoleon is bewildering was nobody involved aware of how awkward it was every single time phoenix spoke his lines     this really wasnt good at all 2 stars feels a bit generous but a few scenes were good but really the bad heavily outweighed the good
Jan 14 2024,positive,a gut wrenching film that didnt sugar coat who napoleon was  i thought it was a war set with a love story theme excellent portrayals and the historical facts brought it home
Jan 14 2024,positive,im a history buff as well as a movie buff so learning that ridley scott would make a movie about napoleon bonaparte starring joaquin phoenix made me more than eager to watch i read stories about the glories of napoleon in many histories of the 19th century but never so thoroughly other than a few modest entries i know there have been many adaptations of his life but i never made the time for them until now    1780s1820s napoleon bonaparte a french corsican artillery captain serves the french republic a revolutionary reign of chaos that seeks order with its only true disciplinary force the army the revolution sparks war with its longtime rivals the british the austrians and the dutch so while frances government is in its violent revolutionary throes napoleon does what he can to quell foreign invaders so well that he becomes a general while this is set and the revolution ends with a less than stable republic napoleon gains the affections of a disgraced noblewoman named josephine from simple attraction to a fierce lust and as napoleon brings glory to the republic his beloved twotimes him but given time and a sense of discretion he grows in power to overthrow the republic he once swore to defend bringing about not just a kingdom but an empire from military victory to diplomatic tact napoleon achieves great glory but his attempts to create a dynasty force him to remove his josephine due to her sterility afterwards he knows great defeats from his invasion of russia and exile to elba his brief return and defeat at waterloo to his final days on st helena the greatness of the emperor ends high and ends lowly but with honor    ive seen modest depictions of napoleon but small parts of the whole never in entirety this was interesting but somewhat awkward ridley scotts movies have never depicted monarchies with respect whether its gladiator or kingdom of heaven this movie is no different in showing a seedy side to napoleon and josephines relationship and this is done mostly for a whole hour whereas in the second hour napoleon is depicted as a brute who destroyed a republic and with an inflated ego took his country to terrible defeat its only in the remaining time with napoleon having lost so much that he acquiesces and endures the rest of his life with respect storytelling aside the acting in this film is phenomenal joaquin phoenix deserves another oscar nomination for his depiction of the great general though not as strong as phoenix vanessa kirby does a splendid job as josephine the rest of the films cast is respectable but not memorable you also would think that forty years of history compacted into two and a half hours is a bit harsh it makes me crave more nevertheless i had a good time spent
Jan 13 2024,positive,epic movie a classic ridley scott picture looked fantastic but other than the battle scenes the movie was slow moving the characters lacked depth and i didnt love most of the casting joaquin phoenix was good but i feel like there could have been a better actor for the role
Jan 13 2024,neutral,too hurried the story of napoleon can not be told properly in 2 and a half hours phoenix isnt great either looks good but disappointing
Jan 13 2024,negative,this was just boring not sure how i feel about phoenix as the lead but nothing felt real or tangible meh
Jan 13 2024,negative,the more you know about the history of this period and napoleon himself the less youll enjoy this superficial silly film scotts napoleon is scripted and edited like the trailer of a far better film
Jan 13 2024,negative,a shame as a ridley scott director and phoenix in lead role pairing for such a tale should have been great     we have seen much better performances recently from phoenix so i fear it can be the direction that hurt this     has ridley scott run out of steam he may need to return to his roots
Jan 13 2024,positive,if you arent interested in historical pieces then youll probably be bored by this movie  the flow of the film feels clunky  i wish the movie started with his younger years and then followed his story through his military career and later death it doesnt really do that it just kind of starts with scenes being labeled with battle name  date  the movie finally found a little stride at the battle of austerlitz scene  but i was disappointed that they ended the movie with josephine saying that she had a secret to tell himthen the movie just ended  i know what her secret was  but other fans might feel left out  joaquin phoenix captured the somber personality of napoleon  but keep in mind that somber can also translate to boring very quickly  i also found it a little weird that he had no accent throughout the movie   in conclusion as a fan of historical figures i didnt regret watching this movie and i did find some of the battle scenes very exciting but i wish the movie told his whole story and had a better flow from start to finish
Jan 13 2024,neutral,not good a history lesson is more interesting than this movie
Jan 13 2024,negative,even ignoring historical inaccuracies this movie is a sequence of scenes with excellent wardrobe but thats pretty much it whats the story here there is nothing that connects the scenes in french history in napoleon psyche thoughts and personal drama in any characters conflicts and resolutions nothing theres no main story no line of drama no conflict or resolution its just extremely poor storytelling so no drama and mostly made up situations that dont describe actual history i am at loss to what was the point of this movie
Jan 13 2024,negative,napoleons life on swipe 158 minutes of joaquin phoenix mumbling and stumbling around weird bedroom scenes historical battles with 100s of 1000s soldiers reduced to two minutes and a bakers dozen and by the time you work out who everyone is youre back in that bedroom  again
Jan 13 2024,negative,looked like a clip show with 90 of the content missing and so many historical lies or just plain fiction  the acting was as wooden as a petrified forrest just horrible
Jan 13 2024,negative,what a farce    pyramids under fire oops   history giggles
Jan 13 2024,neutral,i like phoenix but i dont know i wanted this to be so good it left me so confused about history good scenes with him and his wife though
Jan 13 2024,negative,sweeping sets eye catching cinematography and the occasional stellar acting performance cant save this snoozefest phoenixs portrayal of napoleon is drier than a snuff box in prerevolutionary france his accent is as atrociously flat as kevin costner in robin hood how on earth did he get this part scott must be joking
Jan 13 2024,negative,expected more from ridley scott and joaquin pheonix considering the epic subject matter they had to work with pretty weak sauce
Jan 13 2024,negative,ashamed i paid money to watch it snooze fest they tried to cram too much into the movie focused too hard on his relationship with his first wife after watching this im inclined the think they hated each other and portrayed him as being a passive connoisseur of good fortune on his rise to the top rather than a master manipulator hungry for power im not even sure why everyone complimented the visuals
Jan 13 2024,negative,a disappointment considering the high expectations r scott has achieved i did not understand the almost onedimensional focus on the relationship between napoleon and josephine surely there was more interesting source material that could have been developed from this pivotal period in world history
Jan 13 2024,negative,too brief to be coherent a pathetic attempt at an important story that should be riveting should have been a miniseries joaquin was tepid and autistic when napoleon was ultra charismatic and dazzlingly brilliant what a shame
Jan 13 2024,negative,kind of cheesy and just a so so film
Jan 13 2024,negative,dont waste your money i know what is good this is a terrible film
Jan 13 2024,positive,im in my final year of a history degree have studied the french revolution and know that this movie isnt entirely accurate but i didnt mind i took the scene where they fired at the pyramid to represent the impact heavy artillery must have had on napoleons enemies who hadnt encountered it before it must have shaken more than just the ground    i really enjoyed the film i was gripped all the way through it brought to life a period of history and there were moments when i was almost whooping at the screen i liked the sometimes comical elements of the film but thought more should have been done to show how calculated napoleon was there was a particular moment in the waterloo battle scene where we were right in the middle of hand to hand combat the music came in as emotive guidance  but i just thought how amazing would it have been if scott just cut the music right here and raised the volume of the battle itself the screams the gunfire the canons the chaos  fierce mad and terrifying    there were other moments in the film which i thought were moved on too quickly i thought there were ways to explore napoleons character on a deeper level i liked some of the references to the 1970 waterloo but wished there was more in the way of following the chronology of conquest and his life events instead of dropping in and out at certain points along the way slightly disjointed maybe    all in all i loved it i blown away by some of the battle scenes and had a big smile on my face most of the way through  the period the history and the energy of the character and narrative perhaps my review is somewhat contradictory and maybe that reflects my feelings on the film but it left me with the feeling of yes please more of this    can i make a request for a feature film about nelson next please
Jan 13 2024,negative,film was flat and did not deliver on who napoleon was or what hes achieved it focused mainly on his relationlove with josephine refund please
Jan 12 2024,negative,so disappointing and a travesty to the memory of napoleon the impression one would get from the movie is that he was a buffoon
Jan 12 2024,negative,making a movie about one of the greatest military strategy and tactics genius without any mention of strategy or tactics how did you make a movie more boring than the actual historical facts
Jan 12 2024,negative,quite disappointing frankly the story is not making justice to the character neither his battles surprised this come from scott very poor characters building the focus on the wife absolutely irrelevant and the depiction of the emperor very limited where is the warmonger the genius the state builder not worth seeing had to stop seeing this half of the film
Jan 12 2024,negative,napoleon was a movie to see when you have nothing better to do the acting was okay but the film was very long i suppose if you like war movies and battle scenes you might enjoy it more
Jan 12 2024,negative,i would love to give an articulate view on this but i have already wasted so much time watching it   nope dont do it it starts well and goes careering down hill with a relentless fervour
Jan 12 2024,negative,phoenix had no affect throughout the entire movie what a disappointment
Jan 12 2024,negative,a total misrepresentation of napoleon but then again how can you expect an english director to describe napoleon fairly r scotts worst movie shockingly bad considering how amazing his movies are in general
Jan 12 2024,positive,was decentat times i felt like it just jumped from war to war too quickly  phoenix is superb as always and costume design was excellent  couldve been better even though was quite a long film  passes the rest 
Jan 12 2024,positive,although phoenix did a great job i just felt like the movie overall was just boring
Jan 12 2024,positive,from the first scene it was obvious they were going from dramatic value vs accuracy overall a great movie though
Jan 12 2024,neutral,a film that is both intentionally and unintentionally hilarious
Jan 12 2024,negative,beautiful to look at other than that this movie was way too long and had little substance also joaquin phoenix was not a good fit
Jan 12 2024,negative,the trailer is the best part of the napoleon experience unfortunately the history is butchered characters undeveloped and relationships unexplored eg why was napolean so crazy about joesphine the cinematography is amazing though
Jan 11 2024,positive,slow  beautiful scenery and costumes acting ok just does not seem true to life  french replaced pampered royalty for a different pampered royalty
Jan 11 2024,negative,an epic that has never felt less epic  the film fails to create any attachment to any of the characters  the pacing seemed erratic and the writing seems to have been done by artificial intelligence  i havent been this let down by a movie in years
Jan 11 2024,negative,a vision for the eyes that is paired with a painful sound of the ears  your actors act french 
Jan 11 2024,positive,great take on a historical figure really good acting great costumes  worth the watch
Jan 11 2024,positive,will likely be recognized for wardrobe and cinematography not sure what to make of jps portrayal of the title character no attempt at an accent not that i would know what napoleon sounded like reminded me of sean connery playing a russian sub captain with a brit accent
Jan 11 2024,negative,this move has veen nothing but screw the factsscrew the story developmentscrew the character developmentscrew anything that makes sense about the emperorbut the cinematography is excellent but its a 200 million movie so you expect to atleast get that right
Jan 11 2024,negative,waited for this movie was genuinely excited when i saw it was on ppv on amazon oh god what a waste of 20 got to be up there with one of the worst movies ever was a case of the scenes of napoleon giving josephine a few pumps doggy over the table were as probably more factually correct than the battle scenes think 70s b movie bit worse wow wow soooooo bad who ever advised the director on the battles of the day should be made to reimburse me and everyone else who payed to watch this utter dirge  10 out of 10 it aint no epic in any another scene than an epic piece of shxte
Jan 11 2024,positive,great movie not sure about all the negative reviews very well directed and phoenix doesnt disappoint great movie full of historic events and super entertaining what more can you ask for
Jan 11 2024,neutral,great photography lack of narrative in the story this movie does not explain to audience why napoleon was so great to be consider one of the most influential character in history less important to see sex with two actors that does not even have any chemistry
Jan 11 2024,positive,a beautiful biopic which will both make you laugh and grip your seat to the haters who are mad that napoleon wasnt like that or what about these other accomplishments stop letting your heroworship rob you of enjoying a good film you cant put everything in the movie sorry
Jan 11 2024,positive,i personally thought it was a very good movie with excellent acting
Jan 10 2024,neutral,mediocre no more no less pretty to look at boring in performance nothing made me  care for the story at all not even as a historical piece go wacth the old one if you want history
Jan 10 2024,negative,a less than epic tale of napoleon and joséphine even the sex is boring that should tell you something right there vanessa kirbys immense talent was not put to good use joaquins wasnt either watch joker the wardrobe is great and there is on occasion some great cinematography overall oof that was rotten
Jan 10 2024,negative,a total dud  what could and should have been a great movie was a total damp squib with such great material and such a big budget we were expecting something amazing but instead it was a thoroughly boring drab waste of 25 hours the acting was wooden the story line convoluted  lots of small items mentioned but never followed up on  even the battle scenes were dull it was really a story about the relationship between napoleon and josephine but even that was confusing and inconclusive the only redeeming feature was the costumes which were lovely at times and of course the architecture
Jan 10 2024,negative,ridley scotts movie epic napoleon was released at the back end of 2023 first with a short run in cinemas before dropping onto apple    synopsis an epic that details the checkered rise and fall of french emperor napoleon bonaparte and his relentless journey to power through the prism of his addictive volatile relationship with his wife josephine    i dont know what this film is supposed to be is it supposed to be a historical retelling of napoleons life or a monty python style comic skit ive absolutely no idea and im unsure if scott knew as well based on the outcome    phoenix delivers as always but im not sure even he knew where this was going dont expect the epic performance he delivered in gladiator his last interaction with scott this is something very different     whether its good different is a debatable question i dont have the answer    this is a totally flat and boring film if youre expecting something akin to gladiator youre going to be deeply disappointed as i was    this film seems to show what happens when apple gives a director like scott and his production company absolute carte blanche in the delivery of this film they didnt have to worry about what revenue it generated in cinemas and its become a misguided vanity project    the near on 3hrs run time is time ill never get back     its an awful film    410
Jan 10 2024,negative,disappointing from the start utterly pointless very little character development they appear then disappear a long film that needed to be 3 times longer to achieve its aims
Jan 10 2024,positive,this movie was very good but fell short of being emotionally moved great actions scenes my fav parts of this movie   i wish rscot made more movies like this overall its a 4 starr 4 me
Jan 10 2024,neutral,the visuals and costumes of the show are completely fantastic but lets be honest for a second this show does not accurately represent the true history of napoleon granted the story of napoleon is long and brutal however branding and advertising this movie as even remotely accurate is misleading and outright a huge middle finger to history the movie is just about sex and death if thats your forte then you have found the movie for you but for me it was an alright movie overall but a failure in terms of accurately depicting napoleon
Jan 10 2024,negative,oh my god where do i begin costumes are great cinematography is average but theres a dullness to it theres no vibrancy to entice you to pay attention to this film at all theres no life in it it all feels dead in fact the movie waterloo from 1970 looks better than this and unfortunately its only downhill from here the movie struggles with pacing and lack of direction its like its trying to be 2 movies at the same time a war picture and a melodrama soap opera between napoleon and josephine theres also the glaring historical inaccuracies but that would turn this review into an essay also key events in this film such as certain battles are spread so thin because of time constraints that theres points in the film where youre not entirely sure whats going on anymore and with the lack of vibrant colours makes it all the more harder to pay attention to furthermore the film doesnt even begin to capture the essence of napoleon  the very thing that made him such a tactical genius  it also chooses to portray him as a love sick puppy and josephine as a sexual deviant when in reality it was probably the other way around lastly the poor acting from joaquin phoenix really drags this film down hes just not emotionally present in this role which is shocking because hes a brilliant actor known to become fully emersed in roles but in this film its as if hes not sure how to portray napoleon theres no character consistency with him which unfortunately makes it very difficult to actually care about napoleon as a character my verdict for this film 1 star but because this isnt the worst war film ive seen id give an extra half star just for the costumes and somewhat ok cinematography so final verdict 1 and half stars
Jan 10 2024,positive,he came from nothing   he conquered everything    napoleon is a 2023 epic historical drama film directed and produced by ridley scott      its good   id recommend it if you like this genre     an epic that details the checkered rise and fall of french emperor napoleon bonaparte and his relentless journey to power through the prism of his addictive volatile relationship with his wife josephine
Jan 10 2024,positive,i enjoyed it it told a sad story with great acting by the leads
Jan 10 2024,neutral,threeplus hours and you still have no sense of why millions of  soldiers die for this man or any sense of his leadership qualities joaquin phoenix is greatly miscast as is josephine who is more annoying than interesting the movie alternates between stunning battle scenes and boring josephine scenes with no sense of napoleons legacy to france  the napoleonic code the education system the sale of the louisiana territory etc spectacular battle scenes cannot carry a movie
Jan 10 2024,negative,at 40 minutes i thought about walking out should have listed as a bad documentary i would only watch this again if forced too like in the scene in clockwork orange
Jan 10 2024,neutral,napoleon was once my most anticipated movie of the year and now it has become the most disappointing movie of the year     to get the good out ridley scott was able to deliver on his part with the battle sequences thats where this film does it best work providing big and visually appealing battle sequences the set and costume designs were on theme and for the most part historical accurate finally vanessa kirby although she wasnt in the film much gave a great performance    now the films story is disjointed and messy there is no bigger story that ties everything together instead there are dozens of different plots and subplots thrown all around also the film abandons a lot of these plots to move on to another there is a lot in this film brought up to only be never answered or mentioned again there were some parts of this movie that almost worked for instance the romance between napoleon and josephine was going pretty well until the film threw it away to move to another subplot to return to the romance later and repeat the cycle    another major issue is napoleon himself joaquin phoenix is a great actor but he didnt fit the role whatsoever and it was in my opinion poor casting furthermore napoleon bonaparte in history was an expert military commander an emperor and a total badass his wife josephine whom he loved was constantly having affairs and never seemed to appreciate or care for him as much as he did for her unfortunately this isnt the napoleon seen on screen this napoleon is portrayed as a horny crybaby and josephine is somewhat a sympathetic character i because of the poor writing and messy story struggled to follow along or engage in the story i learned nothing from this film and if i didnt know who napoleon bonaparte was from my history classes i would probably forget who napoleon bonaparte was    napoleon was a disappointing disaster that is made up of a mess of disconnected plots and subplots that are hard to follow with some mildly entertaining battle sequences to barely keep you from leaving the theater
Jan 10 2024,negative,ridley scott  similar to napoleon has his best days behind him  i considered the man a local hero  having grown up less than 30 mile from my home  sadly this is tiresome cinema at its worst when the director seems to entertain no one but himself  gone are the horrors of the retreat from russia  apart from one scene of a horse kebab  and gone is  the historical fact that the british would have been beat if not for the prussians    with all due respect  scott has directed some absolute classics  the duelist  blade runner  alien  the martian  house of gucci  enough to fill anyones cv with enough classics to make him  her sleep easy at night but the last few years have seen  a rapid downhill spiral of a once great director    for a director who pioneered the shaky cam and the uses of special effects  it truly pains me to see that theres 2 scenes at the battle of waterloo where theres clearly water droplets on the camera lens ffs ridley  is that for added realism or the sloppy editing of a director who needs to slink off  the king is dead  long live the king
Jan 9 2024,positive,good historical movie i enjoyed every minute
Jan 9 2024,negative,one of the worst movies ive ever seen in my life finding out that napoleon did his wife doggy constantly for 3 hours and thinking that was going to be good enough for people to turn up and watch is a joke ridley scott time to hang up the camera go lay on the beach youre a joke
Jan 9 2024,positive,i expected to see much higher scores on here after i watched this movie is amazing
Jan 9 2024,negative,not really about napoleon its more about the chick with a boys haircut  did we learn about all the great triumphs of napoleon  no  its a lifetime romance movie  why call it napoleon  because if they marketed it for what it truly was itd have been an even bigger failure
Jan 9 2024,negative,looks stunning visually but historicly very poorly made ridley scots comments didint help ether im not sure if this movie is about napoleon or his wife i can just hope that the rumoured directors cut is good
Jan 9 2024,negative,i think this is the first time i have ever reviewed a movie    i love history and that of napoleon is such an interesting and epic feat  i went into this movie with high hopes which was a mistake ive really enjoyed scots movies in the past but this was terrible not only does it focus too much on his relationship with josephine it turns him into a blundering idiot of a simp they try to make him look both pathetic and lucky where at every turn his soldiers and marshalls roll their eyes at his actions  they gave a short account of austerlitz one of his greatest achievements and focused solely on waterloo making him look like he was afraid of the rain and the oh so great english were masterful they didnt show any military strategy to aid why he is considered  genius  i can even get past historical inaccuracies but they barely touched on history rather just mentions of what is happening in passing and even then you have to know it to catch it  the movie was rushed it was simple and it was the obvious satire of a historical french figure by an english director if you walked into this movie without any knowledge of the history of napoleon you would walk out confused with an image of him as a lucky idiot   you could have painted him as a a great liberator or an evil tyrantbut you did neither you made him a manchilda manchild of the man that brought the whole of europe to its knees  no i am not french nor englishit was just a bad film
Jan 9 2024,positive,it was shot well and the acting was good but the overall presentation was flimsy dull and expected
Jan 9 2024,positive,good historical progression of his exploits but not much substance except in his relationship with josephine about which much was probably unknown with respect to personal dialog
Jan 9 2024,positive,i got a friend request we talked for a few hours and when i found out he was a fraud i ignored all his messages i honestly wouldnt have suspected him if not for the exposure of a professional hacker whom i hired after realizing my bitcoin wallet had been emptied i sincerely dont know how or why these fraudsters operate and if they know the pain and trauma they cause in the lives of their victims when i found my wallet had been emptied i nearly had a cardiac arrest i am a 58yearold taxi driver and i need money now more than ever i resolved to find ways to recover the stolen money and thats when i found cyber genie recovery expert these guys used their wild tech skills to help me trace and recover all that was stolen from me within a short period i hired them i was really patient and understanding with them because after a few sessions i began to have my doubts during these trial moments cyber genies team was very persuasive and encouraging i am glad my doubts and fears never won because the recovery was a success at last all hopes lost were restored stolen money recovered and created a lifetime relationship with cyber genies team   cybergenieatcyberservicesdotc0m  wha sapp 12525120391  telegram cybergeniehackpro
Jan 9 2024,negative,absolutely terrible i went in with low expectations and still couldnt believe how bad it was for some reason the film is washed out in lighting the french and english have the same accents most characters are terribly miscast long scenes are spent on mundane matters while whole battles and other important events are glossed over it continuously tries to be funny and falls flat joaquin phoenix doesnt know what to do with napoleons character and evidently ridley scott had no idea what to do with this film dont do it you will be disappointed
Jan 9 2024,negative,history according to holywood great well filmed action scenes but a poor story line  a grumpy trumpy napoleon a slutty josephine  the movie does in no way justice to this man it makes him responsible for 3000000 deaths but it were the austrians prusians english that waged war on a revolutionary france and wanted to restore the ancien régime   his great achievements eg the code civil the metric system civil registration and others remain unmentioned creating a new france after the feudal era and the chaos of the revolution europe owes a lot to this man
Jan 9 2024,positive,download from the link    
Jan 9 2024,positive,it had a lot of potential good scenery costumes and historical accuracy it just needed more development
Jan 9 2024,negative,they should not have wasted their time on battle scenes at all and focused more on napoleons relationship with josephine court life and french civil society this movie made a halfassed and terrible attempt depicting napoleons long military career that saw such fascinating victories and calamitous defeats the invasion and retreat from russia which saw napoleons grande armée virtually destroyed alone deserves its own movie and would far better depict the folly of giving supreme power to one man i did not find this comedy funny
Jan 9 2024,positive,joachim tired performance and overall gloomy style are neither accurate nor they elevate the film
Jan 8 2024,positive,it was a saga for sure but that is something that i enjoy  im not sure that everyone would feel the same way  i went to be educated as well as entertained  i enjoy true historical movies  the cinematography was incredible and the acting was superb  it held my interest but some of the scenes were pretty bloody  the music was also a huge plusoutstanding
Jan 8 2024,positive,movie was well acted with  lots of action and beautiful sets and scenery movie depicted both napoleons brilliant military strategy as well as his challenging personal life
Jan 8 2024,positive,slow at times but entertaining with great battle scenes and excellent acting 
Jan 8 2024,positive,great movie wish it was longer with better context
Jan 8 2024,negative,expected so much more from this movie lots of material to prove from tried to cover too much in one movie  do better
Jan 7 2024,negative,god help me it was one of the worst movies weve ever seen  my husband and i have been married almost 37 years and have only walked out of perhaps one or two movies during all those years  it was incredibly slow moving  it didnt capture our attention  it was blas  please hold on to your dollars and save it for something more inspiring
Jan 7 2024,positive,the cast is stellar the battle scenes are brilliantly done the storyline is actually pretty good as well so the potential for being a great film were absolutely there  personally i think the film that a quicker pace so less movie minutes could have been beneficial but still a great movie to see in theaters
Jan 7 2024,positive,a dishonor to the greatest short man to live
Jan 7 2024,negative,the film tried to balance portraying the history and love life of napoleon while showcasing realistic battles however neither storyline aspects were really given chance to be fleshed out as events happened with no real explanation or build up the battles themselves were impressive but could not make up for the lack of story around them overall not really worth a watch
Jan 7 2024,positive,i thiught the movie went too much from one scene to another without  follow up of  what was napoleon actions except for scenes of battles  could have been more details of his life and purpose
Jan 7 2024,positive,i expected the movie to be an epic surrounding napoleons military campaigns instead it seemed as if the napoleonic wars are the movies backdrop not its focus the movie attempts to cover far to much content for its runtime many of the josephine scenes could have been cut there are like about 4 sex scenes with josephine the extended cut might help the movie cover more ground but 4 hours is far too long for a movie like this    the movie was shot very well especially during the battle scenes however sheer spectacle cannot and does not make up for the movies many shortcomings
Jan 7 2024,positive,characters were not as well developed as they could have been
Jan 7 2024,negative,didnt grab you lots of history but it was boring long run time but seemed to lack so much napoleon seemed like he was out of place his laugh was to close to the joker save your money and see it when it comes out
Jan 7 2024,positive,definitely worth the money to see this movie epic battle scenes  gives you a little history about napoleon too worth going
Jan 7 2024,positive,tough to gauge its interesting but not exciting action and performances are good but do not pull you in either strange and intriguing musical choices timeline is jumpy and can be hard to follow there also seems to be the assumption that all viewers already know the history of the events being presented overall worth a second watch will definitely check out the extended cut 
Jan 6 2024,negative,wasnt as good as we thought it was going to be
Jan 6 2024,negative,for such interesting history the movie proves to be an extreme bore moving from stale scene to stale scene with a few battles inbetween its hard to sit through a monotone reading of historical dates and events poorly summarized for the yawning listener
Jan 6 2024,positive,had high hopes for this considering director ridley scott was behind it and joaquin phoenix was the lead actor but the movie came up short good acting of course and the battle scenes were excellent but not much character depth joaquins lack of a french accent in comparison to the rest of the cast was tough to get past i wish it was more focused on napoleon as a general and army commander than as a man who struggled in his personal life but i understood the intent of the director overall worth seeing once
Jan 6 2024,positive,acting was excellent story was from an interesting perspective and photography was excellent
Jan 6 2024,positive,im not sure if i enjoyed this movie or not i have enjoyed all of ridley scotts movies with an exception or two but there is something not quite right with this version of napolean from the confusing beginning to the very poor account of the military end at waterloo it left me wanting   perhaps the 70s rod stieger version gives a better big picture of the days of napoleon that scotts version
Jan 5 2024,neutral,impressive battle sequences aside napoleon fails to deliver    just my own opinion of course but this ridley scott movie just didnt click i didnt feel attached to what i was watching i wasnt hooked on the events that were occurring onscreen joaquin phoenix gives a solid enough performance i dont have any complaints with him  nor vanessa kirby    its just the film in general that disappointed none of the nonbattle scenes did anything for me its all so heavily forgettable the added humourquirkiness from the titular character felt out of place or at least wasnt blended with the more serious stuff all that well    the long run time whilst certainly overdone isnt actually all that much of a hindrance  its moreso how poorly the run time is utilized i fwiw have zero issue with historical inaccuracies judging it solely as a film i highly doubt ill want to rewatch this anytime soon unfortunately
Jan 5 2024,positive,underwhelming and slightly boring they made napoleon a cuck that can teleport
Jan 5 2024,negative,ridley scott took a huge  on one of historys greatest commanders of all time hardly anything in this movie is factual you think if you were going to make a historical movie you would pick up a book and read ie he never bombarded the pyramids he wasent antisocial he revolutionized warfare and law and order scott should be smacked for such a historical disgrace but i digress
Jan 4 2024,negative,some really great battle sequences make it watchable otherwise it is far too long given how little it has to say while the tagline he came from nothing and conquered everything is promising whats actually delivered is he stumbled into leadership while obsessing over his distant wife
Jan 4 2024,negative,this is a movie about absolutely nothing just people talking fails to establish proper backstory or context we left halfway through
Jan 4 2024,positive,great action scenes but the rest is a snooze fest imo
Jan 3 2024,negative,just weird and i like phoenix but he was playing a weird version of himself not napoleon
Jan 3 2024,neutral,i forgot i watched this movie i saw it yesterday
Jan 3 2024,positive,at times the picture dragged too much time with the wife also the love scenes could been left out
Jan 3 2024,positive,a truly spectacular film ridley scott is a master of this genre
Jan 3 2024,positive,as far as epic movies goit works particularly the war scenes which are done sucessflully to make you feel like you are in those battlefields and can almost smell the gunpowder and blood   howeverif you have any interest in history whatsoever you will be irked by many thingsmost of all ridley scotts attitude towards history i advise you do your homework beforehand so you are ready for the obnoxious departures from actuality   the positive highlights of the movie are the scenography which is grand no doubt the cast is magnificent but unfortunately directed by ridley scott into onedimensional portrayals of real people who were in fact quite multilayered and fascinating napoleon himself appears sleepy and whiny josephine as an amoral vamp and thats infuriating  the movies downfalls start with age napoleon starts old and ends just as old which is just baffling problem 2 is pace you go from one thing to the next without a real comprehension of whats really going on especially for people unfamiliar with the story but in a nutshell the movies main downfall is all attributable to ridley scotts insolent narcissism where it comes to history   get a life ridley scott and dont be such a pompous ass
Jan 3 2024,positive,the cinematography was captivating the battle scene came to life on the screen and while i didnt dislike this movie i cant say that i liked it joaquin phoenixs portrayal of napoleon fell flat it felt very monotone the movie jumped from battle to battle with very little background on why the particular battle mattered however i found napoleons battle tactics intriguing  worth going to see but not a slam dunk
Jan 3 2024,negative,the film makes napoleon look like a weird man who is unfit and stupid it doesnt show the positive aspects of his conquering career half the movie isnt even about that but about his trouble with his wife
Jan 3 2024,positive,too many events packed into one movie no strong story incredible battle sequences probably wont watch again
Jan 3 2024,positive,they did an incredible job on this
Jan 3 2024,positive,worth the watch though i thought it lacked in certain areas sets costumes battle scenes were amazing
Jan 3 2024,positive,i hoped to learn more about his time in america
Jan 2 2024,positive,not the best movie although i had a great time watching it in cinema especially battles redt was quite good too
Jan 2 2024,positive,i wanted to love this but all i can say is meh if you have 3 and a bit hours to kill id give it a watch but nothing to write home about
Jan 2 2024,positive,thiss not how i immagine napoleon but first i will say that cimetography especialy at the moscow and austerlic was my fav scenes top of that i think they went briliant whit the soundtrack and one of my fav are russia and austerlic and now the problem like i said thiss not how i imagine napoleon and as for historical movie i think there were too many scenes about his romance that about real him napoleon to the public is know for his battle and conquest but not the story of love as the person who knows history well i miss most of the parts about the italian conquest and needed more in dethp when he was in egipt one way or another if they wanted to make love story they picked the wrong person
Jan 2 2024,negative,long and boring  could have been something special fell short
Jan 2 2024,positive,the battle scenes were good but phoenix comes off as slapsticky in certain parts and fails to be convincing as a great military general
Jan 2 2024,negative,we often wondered if this was satire it felt like a disjointed series of battle scenes and strange relationship sex scenes we checked the time often in the last hour wishing the movie would end soon
Jan 2 2024,negative,uninspiring version of history boring main characters questionable accuracy battle scenes were overhyped napoleon never joined the final charge at waterloo crowning achievement the director has the austrians show up from wrong side of the battlefield oof
Jan 1 2024,positive,combination of action and romance
Jan 1 2024,negative,honestly didnt know if it was meant to be a comedy at times we couldnt stop laughing at some points
Jan 1 2024,positive,great acting from phoenix a little too fast and not complete in showing napoleons great life yet it managed to show the human side of napoleon
Jan 1 2024,negative,joaquin phoenix woefully miscast were there no french actors who could have filled the role by comparison rupert everett completely steals the show as the duke of wellington musical soundtrack was overdone i fell asleep briefly during one of the battle scenes
Jan 1 2024,negative,in its detail of the rise and fall of iconic french emperor napoleon bonaparte joaquin phoenix ridley sotts epic is large scale and spectaclefilled its stylised in its stylised filmmaking particularly in its many grey atwar scenes but it lacks consistency in a point of view positioning about him or his relationship with josephine as well as the visual spectacle though it is elevated by a particularly wellwritten witty screenplay
Jan 1 2024,neutral,the battle scenes are welldone and talented actors struggle with the scraps they have to work with but by the end of it i had no insight into napoleon and what motivated him or his relationship with josephine he remains opaque and inert the movie wavers back and forth between napoleon the strategist and napoleon and josephine the love story without doing justice to either there are no thrills and chills while the relationship with josephine is clearly central to napoleons life story nothing here explains their bond or indeed what drove him towards his military exploits and to become emperor  a miniseries would have allowed more time to explore truly fascinating characters its especially sad that josephine patron of the arts collector of roses eventually mother to future rulers is given such short shrift
Jan 1 2024,negative,rs is too skilled a filmmaker to allow this defeat to be a complete waterloo despite the strategic blundering of salacious sensationalized portrayals and lack of historical context he does manage to pull off the occasional brilliancy of tactical photography but the worst command decision by far was casting jp and the titular general he was wrong for the part in every way as i knew he would be when i first heard of his casting my advice to rs know your subject matter and know your cast and you will not be in peril in a hundred films
Jan 1 2024,neutral,it was to choppy and disjointed the battles genes make the entire film 
Jan 1 2024,positive,to many war battle scenes unable to really tell which armies were involved hard to follow series of events even after reading about napoleon b before watching the movie
Jan 1 2024,negative,selfindulgent plodding modern expressions and cultural mannerisms in an historical piece and worst of all lazy acting by the leads the best acting was by the support cast but it couldnt save it i am a 20 year veteran los angeles actor and producer i expected brilliance what i got was a refund the king has no clothes
Jan 1 2024,positive,i liked it i think people were too hard on this film i think the relationship he had with josephine was very interesting i actually see the connection between his folly and poor judgment during the end of his career and his terrible treatment of her i did grow impatient while the movie was wrapping up the end of his life was a drag so that sounds about right
Dec 31 2023,positive,liked the story regarding the napoleon and josephine story   didnt appreciate how much scott diverged from  historical record on the battles  only 200 killed at austerlitz and unaware of the rain aat waterloo
Dec 31 2023,positive,would recommend for fans of historical films not the epic battle film you might hope for however the battle scenes that are depicted are executed magnificently phoenix brings his reliable immersive method acting to convincingly convey the juxtaposition of napoleons relationship ineptitude and military brilliance
Dec 31 2023,negative,it was like watching two movies at once an epic war film hijacked by a lame soap opera
Dec 31 2023,positive,wonderful depiction of scenes and settings phoenix was brilliant in his idiosyncratic portrayal of napoleon it should have been titled napoleon and josephine  not very satisfactory as a history film
Dec 31 2023,negative,great acting and visuals but the story wasnt up to par
Dec 31 2023,positive,forget all the negative comments you read about this film  its fabulous in the traditional ridley scott style napoleon is shown as a complex character with very human frailties as well as genius the cast of characters is excellent on all fronts there are some incredible cinematic moments including the falling through the breaking ice scene i was never bored for one moment of this 2 hours and 37 minutes long film it just zipped on by  so much material to cover in the story of napoleon and an excellent catalyst to inspire one to research more about the historical details and the man go see it and decide for yourself first time i completely disagree with an overall rotten tomatoes rating
Dec 31 2023,positive,pays homage to history a masterpiece
Dec 31 2023,neutral,watchable and riveting during the battle scenes but ultimately a disappointment phoenix performance or is it the direction or screenplay is so enigmatic that perhaps that is the point we are viewing an historical figure who shall remain an enigma himself in the end he loved france the army  and josephine thats it
Dec 31 2023,negative,this movie is a big crp scott should be sued for using the name of napoleon as if it was some king of biography but instead making a totally disrespectful movie without any historical accuracy under the pretext of basing the movie on the letters napoleon exchanged with josephine scott paints a terrible caracter as if the director was trying to avenge anything as he displays the french emperor as a idiotic man a lame lover a arrogant and childish person a naive general and a fierce fighter all at the same time the battle scenes make no sense at all the troops movements are illogic the battles are exaggerated and he puts napoleon on the top of a horse charging the english infantry lol at the battle of waterloo to finish about this movie i can say two things 1  what a disappointment 2  i wanty money and my three hours back ridiculous
Dec 30 2023,positive,excellent costuming and spectacular battle scenes  focuses on napoleon  josephine which should perhaps have been the title  unfortunately that focus didnt give us much of why napoleon was such a hero to the grande armée or his significance to frances civil society a directorial choice obviously  and the film was already long  but still a lack     while spectacular  the battle scenes would  i think have been improved with more attention to how they were actually fought
Dec 30 2023,positive,besides being a nice visual movie of france after its great revolution the accents and characters were more made to seem like a dry wit than a serious tone of a filmography about the character
Dec 30 2023,positive,i personally loved this movie  i dont know how accurate the historical part is but the cinematography acting of course is stellar by joaquin and the action kept me on the edge of my seat   there was so much going on during the battle scenes i would go see it again just to catch stuff i missed
Dec 30 2023,positive,i loved the historical connection and his relationship with josephine it was well acted by the main characters  very enjoyable
Dec 30 2023,positive,great historical depiction of the french revolution and subsequent  joaquin phoenix gave an academy performance
Dec 30 2023,negative,little history little action too much drama next time ill watch a soap opera i hope my review helps you not to watch it
Dec 30 2023,positive,the battle scenes were terrific
Dec 30 2023,negative,previews made me think there would be more war scenes i felt deceived by that was long movie and to me a little boring
Dec 30 2023,negative,where is the charisma and intelligence of this great legendary military leader did he really just fall into being an emperor this film and its stars are charmless and incoherent arguably the best thing about it are the battle scenes
Dec 30 2023,negative,one of the absolute worst movies that i have seen in recent memory  was so excited as a fan of history particularly napoleon
Dec 29 2023,positive,its entertaining but it feels rushed and feel like 40 minutes of the film is missing
Dec 29 2023,positive,i enjoyed the entire movie from the love story between napoleon and josephine to the epic battle scenes the way napoleons personal life was interwoven with his powerful command kept  me glued to the screen from beginning to end
Dec 29 2023,positive,not the theaters fault but at times i had difficulty in hear the conversation between the actors   the acting was very convincing
Dec 29 2023,negative,the most pathetic napoleon ever portrait in a movie    long bored and unaccurate     phoenix great as always but this character has nothing to do with a man as bonaparte was    i truly regretted to take my 16 years old son to watch this fiasco    its a shame that the new generations think this cartoon was napoleon 
Dec 29 2023,negative,high potential terrible delivery not so much a movie about napoleon as most people would remember him
Dec 29 2023,positive,very interesting movie
Dec 29 2023,positive,interesting profile of napoleon and his personal life  as well as containing more historical information than i learned in my history classes joaquin phoenix delivered an excellent performance
Dec 29 2023,positive,since we already know the history there was no suspense building the primary actors are excellent and the staging of  the battles is astounding if you are interested in history and battles go quickly if these topics are not your forte save your money
Dec 29 2023,positive,lead role did an amazing job movie was a little surprising at times war scenes were spectacular
Dec 29 2023,positive,enjoyable historical epic charting napoleons rise and fall kept my interest despite its run time with a nice balance of relationship and battle scenes sincerely hoping that ridley scott keeps banging out more historical epics like this up to the gladiator sequel and beyond
Dec 29 2023,neutral,how can someone screw up something this obvious shouldnt a napoleon biography be cultic monumental powerful the only thread keeping this patched and stuck together plot from falling apart is the love part for josephine which would have been better as a secondary story even the score feels weird and lacking at times my only positive point is joaquin phoenix
Dec 28 2023,positive,even though it is not exactly accurate it was entertaining acting was great  it has war and a love story something for all adults
Dec 28 2023,positive,excellent movie but made napoleon too morose and depressed he also was shown as too infatuated with josephine   waterloo should have been given more time to develop events leading up to it  acting was superb good job to include most of napoleons key decisions and hi accent to power
Dec 28 2023,negative,i felt like i did not learn a lot about napoleon in this version of his life rubbish
Dec 28 2023,negative,ehhhh well it had some cool things in it 
Dec 28 2023,positive,pretty good not for the typical movie watcher who doesnt care about any story and only wants action movie is relatively slow but was interesting especially if you like historical type movies
Dec 28 2023,positive,its alright reminds me of the death of stalin in terms of showing the chaos in power shifts and power vacuums also reminds me because of its funnyness
Dec 28 2023,negative,how do you make a movie about one of the most dynamic characters of history with a full ensemble cast of his brilliant and enigmatic marshalls and mess the film up so bad its obvious that ridley scott has gotten progressively worse since alien and he should have retired a long time ago
Dec 28 2023,negative,horrible movie poor b c and d storylines no antagonist lazy acting job no secondary characters
Dec 28 2023,positive,story and acting were excellent  a 3 hour movie of historic proportion  love these historical projects  also the popcorn was good with one bourbon
Dec 28 2023,positive,good movie well rounded with action and drama i almost forgotten that napoleon spent the last 6 years of his life on the island of st helena the battle scenes were really interesting and there were clearly losses on all sides of the battles the movie was a good historical experience
Dec 28 2023,positive,large scale epic with great setscostumes learned a lot about napoleon
Dec 27 2023,positive,great mix of the personal love story with josephine and the battle scenes this film walked the fine line between personal relationships and grandiose battle scenes without getting bogged down in the minute details yes it was a bit long but probably necessary to fully tell the story it certainly helps to have some basic historical background but the movie is broad enough that you dont need to be a history buff to enjoy fantastic scenery and choreography in the battlefield
Dec 27 2023,negative,two words  uninteresting and unemotional was looking forward to a blockbuster like gladiator but alas not even worthy of a screen saver  the opening scene with marie antoinette being pelted with rotten tomatoes as she approaches the gallows should have been a big hint to audiences of what was to come the next 130 minutes
Dec 27 2023,positive,the napoleon film has of course such a great cast and director   its very well done the fight scenes are quite realistic if it makes sense   do not be fooled whatsoever it can be quite violent and shouldnt be whatched by someone with a weak stomach   it very well represents the frivollity of the fights conquerers and imperers liked to have just for fun   it represents the little people in power cared about human life   i strongly recommend watching it it is to better understand what xix centurys wars vital
Dec 27 2023,negative,boringboring very superficial
Dec 27 2023,negative,somebody needs to read some history before writing a biopic
Dec 27 2023,negative,ridley scott seems intent on painting napoleon in a certain light with this film  and for a lengthy piece thats literally named after the man very little of the movie even touches on what made napoleon one of the most influential people in human history   it is strangely fixated on an awkward romance with his wife who ridley scott tries to credit with napoleons greatness through a series of boring scenes between the two  most of the dialogue is hacky and cringeworthy  napoleon is not at all portrayed the way he was known to have been  the plot jumps around with no explanations of what or why certain events are happening  napoleons tactical genius on the battlefield is also not touched on the film instead lazily opts to show flashy set pieces and action sequences in lieu of anything with real substance or coherence  all in all this movie is nothing but a semihistorical hit piece made by a salty brit
Dec 27 2023,negative,awful ridley please leave the history alone
Dec 26 2023,negative,it was just not entertaining i was very uncomfortable watching all the sex scenes with my dad and i will never understand why they are put in movies who are they catering to
Dec 26 2023,positive,too many battle scenes they were welldone but went on a bit long and became repetitious could have had more depth to the relationship between napoleon and josephine nevertheless it was well acted and had excellent effects and i enjoyed it very much overall
Dec 26 2023,negative,phoenix did not rise from the ashes his acting hit a new low and i would have liked subtitles on the screen so i could have heard his dialogue through his mumbling  dont waste your money and time
Dec 26 2023,positive,excellent acting that ending final scene really
Dec 26 2023,positive,typical ridley scott  lots of blood and gore  battle scenes are great and realistic  joaquin phoenix does a wonderful job going from brutal battle leader to tender moments with josephine  probably wouldnt watch it twice but i can absolutely recommend it once
Dec 26 2023,negative,napoleon directed by ridley scott is an ambitious historical movie that takes viewers on a treacherous journey through the life of one of france most fascinating figures while it boasts stunning visuals and a captivating narrative a few elements left this reviewer feeling underwhelmed  one of the most notable disappointments in napoleon was the films treatment of crucial battles such as the grand battle of borodino in russia regrettably this epic confrontation was given minimal screen time leaving history enthusiasts like myself craving more detailed and dramatic portrayals of these pivotal events  moreover the performance of joaquin phoenix as napoleon needed to have the complexity and depth that many expected while phoenix is undoubtedly a talented actor his distinctive appearance and captivating portrayal of the joker in previous films overshadowed his portrayal of napoleon it was challenging to detach phoenixs stunning almost insane face from the character making it difficult to invest in his performance as the legendary french leader fully  another point of contention lies in the portrayal of napoleons physical attributes throughout the movie he is presented as an averageheight man ignoring the historical fact that he stood at a mere 52 by not addressing this characteristic the movie inadvertently misleads viewers despite his diminutive stature it fails to capture the extraordinary nature of the man who conquered nations and whats with the constant plugging of his ears like a little girl it was instead a whimsy trait  despite these shortcomings one aspect of the film made it bearable for this reviewer  the presence of a special lady by my side although a drag the movie was sometimes made more enjoyable through shared moments with a loved one in the company of this remarkable lady the movies flaws became somewhat overshadowed making the experience more tolerable  in conclusion napoleon is a wellintentioned historical epic that falls short of its potential while the movie features stunning visuals and an intriguing narrative the lack of focus on significant battles joaquin phoenixs jokeresque appearance and the inadequate portrayal of napoleons height diminish its impact however the bliss of sharing the movie experience with a loved one adds a touch of heat to an otherwise lukewarm viewing experience
Dec 25 2023,neutral,really disappointed there wasnt enough included to understand the timeline or even how some events lead into others or are even relevant the film covers too much time to fit enough in to be easy to follow as someone who studied napoleon in college i knew what was going on but had to explain a lot to family and friends the only positive was the battle scenes which where incredibly well done and carry the film
Dec 25 2023,positive,should have been made as a mini series lots of historical information was missing
Dec 25 2023,positive,the historical aspect was was great and the costumes and the scenery were extraordinary and of course we love joaquin phoenix
Dec 25 2023,positive,terrible approach cannons against the pyramids coming from a man who became famous for his scientific expedition to egypt the beginning of egyptology ridley scott has probably never heard of dominiquevivant denon otherwise he would never have committed a heresy like this there are other heresies made by a brilliant director who created some masterpieces one of them the duelists set against the backdrop of exactly a napoleonic period it would be worth reading machiavellis prince with napoleons comments to know how far from the brute portrayed in the film napoleon was the directors biggest mistake was underestimating the historical importance of napoleon and underestimate the intelligence of those who know napoleons life in depth therefore maintaining my respect to the brilliant director i stop here
Dec 25 2023,negative,only for the action scenes probs oh the worst scott movie ever made
Dec 25 2023,negative,should have named it josephine unbearable
Dec 25 2023,negative,did not learn much about napoleon
Dec 25 2023,neutral,interesting costuming and settings boring dialog  unimpressive soundtrack sex scenes c
Dec 25 2023,negative,too much attention to napoleons love life very little attention paid to the strategy he employed in his  battles what happened to the farmhouse on the battle of waterloo
Dec 25 2023,negative,one of my favorite directors until i saw this horrible movie first there is very little french spoken second 90 of the  film was shot in england third 95 of the frenchmen are played by english or irish actors with heavy accents they simply lack believability fourth the action scenes are 80 animation and not close to realistic fifth napoleons greatness as a reformer and libertarian is never addressed and the movie instead focuses on the darkest aspects of his relationship with josephine sixth he is portrayed as a whining and whimpering  husband with poor social graces there is no redeeming this horrible production
Dec 25 2023,negative,the movie was visually stunning but completely lacked heart and purpose  all it did was check boxes on events of napoleons career  with joaquin phoenix i had expected a more indepth character study but this was not the case  i guess ill wait for the 4hour version
Dec 25 2023,negative,way across the board with timelines not a lot of character arc no real emotions the whole time
Dec 24 2023,positive,amazing  beautifully done  costume design  cinematography excellent  battle scenes are powerful  and add in the passionate love story  i hope oscar goes home with the writers  as well as so many others who created this movie  top acting and casting
Dec 24 2023,neutral,needed more war action and less soap opera drama
Dec 24 2023,positive,i liked that the director was not afraid to show the story of napoleon in his own way from the side of love deep and influential some of the best battle scenes in cinema today
Dec 24 2023,neutral,disappointing given the amazing potential of such an incredible historical figure    didnt seem like the director bothered to develop a storyline thought phoenix was miscast made someone who inspired a nation to fight for him into a querulous grumpy old fart     couldnt believe in the reputed great love story between josephine and bonaparte which was a shame because it formed such a large part of the film     instead of a producing a flawed genius against an epic historical background they just made victor meldrew in a threecornered hat
Dec 24 2023,positive,decent movie it can get boring at times although it is a must see for historymilitary lovers
Dec 24 2023,negative,if you want some insight into napoleon bonaparte dont go see this film the battle scenes are the best ive ever seen in any film but jaoquin phoenix will give you no clue he is basically wooden throughout the film he doesnt show any emotion even when there are situations that cry out for it  no anger crying frustration or  insanity  giving us some clue about napoleons personality  ridley spends an inordinate amount of time on napoleons seeming obsession with josephine and no time spent on napoleons beginnings his rise through the ranks etc  the film jumps back and forth between monumental battle scenes and sex scenes with josephine but throughout it all  phoenix remains expressionless at one point  after conquering egypt napoleon opens a sarcophagus and views an ancient mummified queen that mummy had more expression than jaoquin
Dec 24 2023,positive,joachim phoenix provides a captivating performance as napoleon  the cinematography is particularly good  a big subject thats hard to capture in a little more than two hours
Dec 24 2023,positive,fan of joaquin phoenix and he did great in this part  easy to follow and good entertainment on a saturday night date
Dec 24 2023,positive,i like the movie a lot  it could have shorter
Dec 24 2023,positive,it is a good movie and great for history buffs  however it was about a half an hour too long
Dec 24 2023,neutral,i love ridley scott but this one was rough shot beautifully and joaquin phoenixs performance was superb but it not a movie i can visit again
Dec 24 2023,positive,ok ridley scott is a brilliant director this film is shot beautifully of course the topic is just too big for 3 12 hours a ten part hbo series maybe there is just way too much content from his life that leaves people lost in the story the historical inaccuracies dont really bother me because of obvious budget constraints 
Dec 23 2023,positive,excellent movie phoenix was fire
Dec 23 2023,positive,its a great production that would have worked far better as a multiepisode miniseries than a movie and im talking about both theatrical and extended cuts    they frankly leave too much out of napoleons life due to the restrictions of film and the movie suffers for it but the production sets are amazing and the cast is phenomenal i personally really enjoyed the movies focus on the bizarre relationship between napoleon and josephine
Dec 23 2023,negative,this is the same ridley scott who made gladiator made this steaming pile of 
Dec 23 2023,positive,visually amazing and the acting was great but all over the place for a while
Dec 23 2023,negative,a terrible experience  a biopic about napoleon done by someone who despises the character  the movie is in general ridiculous in the way napoleon is depicted the cherry picking of his life the battles and its outcomes all of it terrible  even the music is weird making some scenes sound like a comedy and not fitting the images  in the good side the costumes are pretty good and the photography of the movie is exceptional
Dec 23 2023,positive,napoleon from ridley scout was amazing has a good story telling even was not history accuracy but some point i think i know was it real    jaquein phoniex was masterpiece as napoleon he has good acting good talent play as napoleon vanessa kirby play as josephin was good as well    the fight cinematography was amazing and was brutal the romance was good enough but at some point the movie is very slow and wasting time seems like slow pase without any perspective    it was amazing but not masterpiece
Dec 23 2023,negative,long and boring  the plot couldnt decide if it was a bad romance or a weak war epic  dont waste your time
Dec 23 2023,positive,epic fun worth a watch ridley scott does it again a masterpiece
Dec 23 2023,positive,pretty good but could have been better
Dec 23 2023,positive,great movie i enjoyed it it does try to cover too much in one movie and still leaves out quite a bit  it would be hard to follow if you dont already know the history  great cinematography and battle scenes
Dec 23 2023,negative,horrible slow needless gore left after 12 hr
Dec 23 2023,negative,this movie was boring and confusing it was rushed and tried to cover too much about napoleons life in one movie i was pretty disappointed
Dec 23 2023,positive,loved the epic period show casting was perfect excellent cinematography i admired the main characters  i would recommend if this is your genre   butaccents were a big distraction  no one expects him to sound like hes an american  french best but british if not  this wasnt a deep enough dive into the man himself
Dec 23 2023,negative,how do you put the life of one of historys really important figures into a 160 minutes    not like this thats for sure    i admire ridley scotts work he has undoubtedly put together some of the greatest films of all time but napoleon is way off    dull boring and just not good you can see the money spent on the sets and costumes its a big budget film but it just doesnt engage you    i didnt like kingdom of heaven first time round but its grown on me maybe napoleon will do the same 
Dec 22 2023,positive,great cinematography  unbelievable battle scenes  the josephine factor was a bit overdone  some of the dialogue appeared muddled  on purpose
Dec 22 2023,positive,very disappointed with the movie attempting to cover such a massive subject in two and a half  hours is pretty impossible  too much time spent on his sexual relationship with josephine which really of no significance to the character  no time on his countless other abilities like laying down the basis of law and education for france today  or the workings of his mind after the reign of terror had ended  no mention of the cystitis or cancer which bugged him this whole time  the casting must have been done either in a rush or to trim the budget the main character reminded me of poirot but having no idea who he was supposed to be see rod steiger in waterloo for a napoleon with passion and fervour  the duke of wellington was so ridiculous he could have been picked from a christmas panto  having restrained myself from sniggering in the cinema at some of the scenes and dialogue i cant believe this film cost 200 million dollars to make  what a wasted opportunity it should have been a substantial contribution to show our history and some recognition of the mans achievements apart from his failed conquests  i would award it 5 out of 10
Dec 22 2023,positive,an entertaining historical drama with great battle scenes some more time dedicated to napoleons return after exile would have been great though
Dec 22 2023,positive,didnt spend much time on military affairs or tactics but spent time dealing with the guy in life gives a different view of the times and the man
Dec 22 2023,positive,on a technical level the movie was extremely well done really felt like ii was back in the time depicted   only negative  the story often leapfrogged forward becoming somwehat disjointed  im sure it was done to cut the movie down to a theatrical length but for viewers with no historical perspective my wife it would bewas difficult to follow
Dec 22 2023,neutral,battle scenes could have been condensed
Dec 22 2023,negative,while the movie boasts impressive cinematography throughout the movie its almost as if the director had no clear direction for the movie is it a movie that focuses on his military genius which they failed anyway as the movie showed him as a desperate general with one victory and proceeds to almost blame him for the lives of 3 million people at the end of the movie a movie that focuses on his personal relationships or a movie that attempts to depict his contributions to civil law and society this movie is character assassination at its finest and i regret even purchasing tickets to watch it rather than wait for it to come to streaming
Dec 22 2023,positive,it was alright a bit boring at times but enough interesting stuff in there to keep my attention for the long run time certainly not anyones best work both in front of the camera and behind
Dec 22 2023,positive,essentially a parlor piece about napoleon and josephine with some occasional great battle scenes to break the boredom there are embarrassing childlike scenes showing their relationship despite being a great actor phoenix portray the emperor as a weak almost pathetic figure but surely he had more power and charisma than this to achieve what he did perhaps the fault lies in the script and director i was expecting something far more epic and engaging
Dec 22 2023,positive,story not following true event surprisingly funny but overall solid
Dec 22 2023,positive,the movie was good but i couldnt look past the fact that they should have had a younger actor play young napoleon even a good actor who is in his late 40s cant look 24 josephine was older too
Dec 22 2023,positive,a truly well made movie that checks all the boxes except for likeable characters this film hates the french and it most certainly hates its characters it rips apart every characters lives and shows the worst of them a spectacle of what true human evil is it will make you uncomfortable as you watch these horrible actions and personalities clash in an epic tale of our history this is a watch once kind of movie but worth the watch
Dec 22 2023,positive,was it about a general or was it a love story    not enough focus
Dec 22 2023,positive,i thought the cinematography was beautiful joaquin phoenix is always awesome but the story lacks some depth  it would have been great to have a better score also there was not enough background on napoleon and they made him too much of a wuss over the female lead would have liked to have seen similar scenes like oppenheimer where theyre trying to show how great his mind works with strategy there should have been a few more characters developed around him some side stories could have been great was ok walked away from the movie with more distate for napoleon as a lovelorn wimp than a great tactical conqueror did appreciate the incredible horror of his decision to press into russia which brings back memories of world history
Dec 22 2023,positive,incredible and realistic battle scenes
Dec 22 2023,positive,well made film but it tries to cover too much
Dec 21 2023,negative,i sure wish i didnt watch will ferrell in elf the day before i saw this movie because it seemed like napoleon bonaparte was  played by joaquin phoenix channelling will ferrell in elf what was going on is there any historical evidence that napoleon was that goofy or some kind of idiot savant i cannot recommend this mess of a movie
Dec 21 2023,negative,the movie fails to explain napoleons geniality and originality why he was feared by his enemies and revered by his followers  perhaps the movie tries to cover an excessively large period of time and therefore does not develop the characters enough  josephines character is also very superficial she has few lines and none significant  a lot of time spent in useless violence and sex scenes should have been devoted to better develop the historical and philosophical context
Dec 21 2023,positive,napoleon directed by the duke of wellingtonor wait my bad by ridley scotthas some cool technical stuff and interesting ideas from the director but overall its not a great movie ridley scott seems a bit offtopic and carries a very weird and negative vision of the character the choice of joaquin phoenix for napoleon is also a big problem i really like him but playing an ambitious young guy around 20 doesnt quite fit the movie makes napoleon look like a messedup tough  bad guy that cannot pronounce three words in a row this negative way of doing things along with many historical mistakes is a real problem that the shows quality cant make up for
Dec 21 2023,negative,dispassionate performance by joaquin phoenix  generally boring
Dec 21 2023,negative,just atrocious garbage of a film napoleon was a conqueror not a pathetic weak vessel like how they portray him in this waste of a couple of hours
Dec 21 2023,negative,its a bloody awful mess i had so much respect for ridley scott  but after this pile of pp of a movie lost all faith i had to watch the old 1970s waterloo movie to remind myself what a missed opportunity it was whose idea a was to put joaquin phoenix as napoleona any he he is visibly out of his depth
Dec 21 2023,positive,really liked the movienot so much the advertising beforehand  unbelievable that in the 27 minutes when the movie was scheduled to start 630and the actual start time 657 there were repeated car commercials  when i pay for a movie at the theatre that practice is unforgivable shame
Dec 21 2023,neutral,got some cool moment got some boring moment its not really my fit sorry 610
Dec 21 2023,positive,the battle scenes were terrific
Dec 21 2023,positive,good but not as great as i expected  its superficial in the sense that it covers the battles as nauseam but you dont get a sense of him or his brilliance as a leader good film shots of fights but lacks depth for sure
Dec 21 2023,positive,not easy to do but well balanced and not boring at all
Dec 21 2023,positive,beautiful costumes loved the action and story
Dec 21 2023,negative,terrible movie the storyline has no connection napoleon is shown as a goofy silly weird man i wouldnt recommend it to anyone to watch it
Dec 21 2023,positive,ridley scott provides beautiful imagery not seen in any war movie except bravehart those seeking an emotional impact from phoenix are going to be let down the film merely provides a visual outline to napoleons time as emperor most americans cant tell you which country napoleon was the emperor of so i believe scott wanted to visually educate the common man on napoleons time as a military general and not necessarily the personal traits of the man the desire for a more heartfelt film and the poor reviews are confusing because im not so sure i want to know the man beyond his actions his actions said enough to know who he was movie critics today dont seem to form their own opinions and stick to them when i walked out of this film i genuinely enjoyed it and found it to be a top 2 film of the year i also learned a lot i had not previously known many filmgoers today read bad reviews and that dictates their movie experience which is very disappointing for the state of filmmaking i can completely understand if napoleon scholars were let down but to those people i say then do better
Dec 20 2023,positive,overall i like the movie i really liked josephine liked the filming a bit odd the content of it but i gave it a four star
Dec 20 2023,positive,i liked this movie a lot it has shades of gladiator for obvious reasons if you like ridley scott andor joaquin phoenix andor historical war films you will like this you may not love it my only criticism after first viewing is ironically it feels like it should be longer i wanted to see more details in certain years and decades that slide by too quickly
Dec 20 2023,positive,excellent movie historical and similar to many epic movies of the past
Dec 20 2023,positive,impressive cinema art but shallow storline about napoleon  if you want to watch a castrated napoleon who acts like a teenager in love through and through yes this is the version of his life to watch  the scenes were superbly done the costumes the detail all impressive  but this felt like the story of a lovey dovey man who had only one obsession one josephine  i guess 25 hours to tell such a lifetime is simply not long enough
Dec 20 2023,negative,sound poor story very confusing josephine  was great battles completely confusing couldnt tell who was who over all not worth it
Dec 20 2023,positive,a spectacular historical drama reminiscent of titanic barry lyndon and gods and generals well done but maybe too much history to cover properly in 2 and half hours
Dec 20 2023,positive,i expected to be dozing off by the twohour mark but this period film was so incredibly visually stunning and stimulating when it ended i was like what its over already loved it
Dec 20 2023,positive,the film was very inspirational and the movie made me want to learn more about him
Dec 20 2023,positive,epic film there are few directors who could get away with making an esoteric historical war pic like this anymore
Dec 20 2023,positive,the movie highlights most of the critical turning points and chapters of napoleons life its an ambitious task to summarize the life and impact of napoleon in less than three hours unless you have a multi film saga it would be impossible to capture all of the events and nuance of such a complex figure the action scenes are incredible and the cinematography are fantastic the humor and human element of napoleon was enjoyable making an entirely unrelated figure relatable leaving the theater i heard a teen ask his friends so was napoleon the good guy or the bad guy which i think is the right takeaway
Dec 20 2023,negative,was hoping for more battle scenes  emphasis on his tactical brilliance the movie really dragged on and focused on his home life reminded me a lot of alexander and pearl harbor where the movie wasnt quite sure what story it wanted to tell very disappointed in the movie
Dec 20 2023,negative,maaan as someone who studied napoleon in 11th grade and enjoyed it immensely at the time i was happy to see this movie being made sadly i let my heart rule my head again and should of known it would be butchered this so called historical biopic by scott is riddled with not just inaccuracies but is 90 total fan fiction most of the battles their actual outcomes and napoleons role in and sometimes even presence at said battles are simply wrong     napoleons personality and character is so far removed from actuality that he is unrecognisable to anybody with any knowledge of this intriguing character    im a masive fan if phoenix but he was bad casting for this role and it seems he has been giving little to non accurate character reference to base his potrayal on andor what little he was given poor    the bulk of the blame has to land with riddley here and his dismissive comments on the legit constructive criticism is dissapointing
Dec 20 2023,positive,excellent film amazing cinematography great humor throughout happy to see it again 
Dec 20 2023,neutral,overall not that great
Dec 20 2023,neutral,very underwhelming it feels like the creation of this wasnt taken seriously or cared for historical details dont seem accurate with unfitting dialogue the set design  battles look very good but there isnt much impact
Dec 20 2023,negative,if you like history this movie isnt for you if you like action this movie isnt for you neither a disaster almost the entire movie napoleon is shown like a child we cant follow the storyline correctly ans understand everything you must know that this film is not a biopic about napoleon if you go watch it keep that in mind 
Dec 20 2023,negative,napoleon was so much more then what this picture showed and for that i give it half a star he barely showed any emotion through out the movie
Dec 20 2023,positive,some things work and some things different
Dec 20 2023,neutral,i know no more about the man napoleon than i did yesterday there is no way that an effeminate quiet man who couples with the artistry of a dog accidentally becomes emperor not buying it  loved the scenery the battle scenes were brutal  but also really stupid and what was with josephines hair before she wedded  it was an incomplete film 200 mill reminds me of heavens gate
Dec 20 2023,positive,loved the movie  the battle scenes especially of the cracking frozen lake was incredible  i loved the   horses battle participation  the background music was incredible and made the battle scenes more intense  i hope to see the making of the movie   as usual joaquin phoenix acting was superb and i was impressed with the role of josephine vanessa kirby in the movie  i really do not know how true to history this movie manifests but i am inspired to investigate that period and napoleons role and his impact on the world
Dec 19 2023,positive,a well done story of history  acting was really good
Dec 19 2023,positive,great battle scenes
Dec 19 2023,positive,great movie epic scenes and so much insight into napoleons life
Dec 19 2023,positive,good historical timeline but boring content mostly about his love life and banishment
Dec 19 2023,negative,boring movie theme was choppy
Dec 19 2023,positive,this movie was emaculant
Dec 19 2023,negative,lush and exquisitely filmed  but an odd story that thinks the core of understanding napoleon is his interest in josephine  for all its bluster the story is remarkably vapid
Dec 19 2023,negative,it was terrible i did not finish watching left after about half time
Dec 19 2023,negative,grey drab and overcast scenery grey drab and careless from joaquin phoenix his lacklustre and uninterested performance was a disgrace overly long scenes of irrelevant conversation moments of benny hill style farce and the battle scenes were rushed and lacking any emotional verve a poor poor film that lacked coherent purpose
Dec 19 2023,neutral,the movie josephine a napoleons story has some great battle scenes but has too much dialogue that brings nothing to the story of napoleon or josephine you leave the movie without knowing much about josephine and not feeling anything for napoleon however the movie trailer was great
Dec 19 2023,negative,i imagined a movie that was more about his successful campaigns and his mind for military tactics and much less about his incessant need to copulate extremely boring barely worth watching terribly long save your efforts and watch a documentary
Dec 19 2023,negative,random and disjointed script
Dec 19 2023,negative,sorry but this one didnt do anything for me disappointed
Dec 19 2023,positive,exellent true to the events and another master performance by joaquin
Dec 19 2023,positive,it was a little slow but it did explain a lot about napoleon himself that is what i went there to see
Dec 18 2023,negative,i could hardly have been worse
Dec 18 2023,positive,liked it alljoaquin phoenix played that part great
Dec 18 2023,negative,this film deserve nothing more than one star  0 for the historic coherence  2 for the scenes and the film technicaly  1 for the actors   a huge deception and i do not say this because i am french i went to see it knowing that it was no going to be a huge france history tribute but despite that i was shocked by a so big lack of quality
Dec 18 2023,positive,the movie is not concerned in give you a history class your homework should be done yourself but it still have a point the polarity between napoleon and josephine the impotence of a leader even when by the books it seems almighty and the relevance and independence of his wife even when it seems its not
Dec 18 2023,negative,long tedious and vulgar  im utterly fascinated by the life of napoleon and the napoleonic era in europe  i started wanting the film to end within the first 10 minutes  most of the film is devoted to napoleon sitting across from josephine making enigmatic comments with long silences between  even the battle scenes failed to hold my interest and in places seemed absurd  the critics called it slyly funny  what film were they watching
Dec 18 2023,negative,we didnt make it past the graphic and totally unnecessary sex scene with napoleon and his wife  how did that help the story  not everybody goes to the movies to see sexual content  please guys
Dec 18 2023,negative,the worst boring bad acting terrible storyline
Dec 18 2023,positive,the movie was exhilarating and boring but still a very good movie
Dec 18 2023,positive,comedic impressing well acted i get what scott was going for and i praise him for doing his own thing once again
Dec 18 2023,negative,just terrible i took my senior european history class to this movie excited to see napoleon come to live     instead it made them sad uncomfortable and longing when actual history was included about historical figure based movies     complete trash
Dec 18 2023,positive,this was a good movie but not a great one i loved the acting and was glad it wasnt all battle scenes just didnt pull me in enough
Dec 18 2023,positive,okay i really liked the movie but you cant just focus on the man without focusing on what he did to his troops and any of the agony that he caused france during his reign i was so excited to see this movie because i was in paris 3 week ago seeing the palace of versaille notre dame and other locations come to life in addition to all the dress that was worn in that time that was truly my favorite part there was a lot of substance missing and we just skipped to the next big war campaignnot really even explaining why
Dec 18 2023,negative,overrated director   k
Dec 18 2023,positive,covered a long period of napoleons career basically a remake of the 1954 classic movie on napoleon highlighted napoleons love for josephine
Dec 18 2023,positive,its a great telling of a powerful man in history i liked it acting was well executed and i liked the flow
Dec 18 2023,positive,not sure why this movie has been receiving such low ratings but my husband and i really enjoyed it  i held off from seeing it because of the ratings but glad i decided to see it for myself and i glad we did
Dec 18 2023,positive,felt like the movie could be an hour longer there was so much it was good
Dec 18 2023,negative,this movie really wandered and stumbled around and in the end left me wanting to never have to watch it again
Dec 18 2023,negative,the worst movie made with napoleon  an insult to the 7th art the french people soul and history made by a talentless hack of a director who should just retire  braindead movie made for the average braindead consumer  no narrative structure and horrible flow just a series of tableaux disconnected from each other with zero context a stream of historical dates similar to what you would find in the table of contents of a history book with no substance and lyricism to set them in motion  the movie is centered on the relationship between napoleon and josephine and portrays it in an uninteresting and dispassionate way with a lot of cringe moments  the overall acting is off with this movie and extremely shallow when it comes to secondary characters or wrong for the main ones   joaquim phoenix is a disaster as napoleon mostly playing an asocial version of the character with no charisma and passion its so far removed from the real character and his corsicaitalian blood its like seeing a mannequin imagined by the worst 19thcentury british propagandist being shown on a stage in the most grotesque and simplistic way there are a lot of weird scenes when napoleon laughs like the joker mumbles strange comments and acts weird especially when it comes to sex scenes with joséphine he behaves most of the time as a wimp who is always crying and lamenting when people are not keeping him in the loop  the actress playing josephine is good but lacks the creole passion that animated her real counterparty furthermore  the lack of any form of chemistry between her and napoleon makes the scenes bleak depressing and soporific it veers to the grotesque when there is an attempt at a me too injection when josephine is slapped into divorce and abdication  everything is shallow in this movie and no other actors manage to exist their names come fly and are just forgotten almost none of the generals and maréchals are present some of them are barely mentioned same for talleyrand and fouché who are an afterthought in this movie  napoleons military genius is also nonexistent instead of showing the movie just tells and fails at it spectacularly battles are confusing and there is almost no way to understand clearly why the french are winning despite some shallow focus on anecdotic things it looks like its just surprise attacks most of the time to add to the insult napoleon is portrayed as a saberrattling maniac until waterloo which is total nonsense  the siege of toulon looks like a viking assault austerlitz is a joke nothing is explained set up and shown and everything is focused on the frozen lake which is not the reason for napoleons victory the battle of the pyramids is a travesty with cannon balls being fired at the pyramids and nothing being shown especially the square formation used by the french against the mamelouks   waterloo is just a little better but still it does not make any sense and does not show the first battles against wellington and blucher its simplified and the only thing that is well done is the british square formation the old imperial guard is not portrayed correctly and his battle and historical significance are lost on the audience epic moments of the battle are absent like ney and his famous sentence this is how a french maréchal dies also the major role played in the defeat by the incompetence of the general grouchy or napoleon sickness are not incorporated    going back to the lack of passion the legend of napoleon and his army is also not represented we dont understand why the army loves napoleon why the people adore him and side with him during the cent jours and how it has struck french imagination and fascination for more than 2 centuries  there is a clear intention to sabotage and misrepresent the napoleonian epic the campaignliberation of italy is missing some of its high notes like arcole and rivoli   the entrance of the french army in vienna and the acclamation of bonaparte by beethoven are curiously absent the academic aspect of the egyptian expedition and the conquest of jerusalem are also absent the importance of napoleon in the creation of the foundation of the modern french state with the civil code is not mentioned even in passing same treatment for the emancipation of the jewish people  there is an over romanticization of historical events with josephine being the reason for the escapes from egypt and the elbe island  the last 2 scenes of the movie show what this is all about a prosecution against napoleon the sainthelene scene tries to show that napoleon is a liar and the last scene tries to lecture napoleon and the viewer about the absurdity of war and its toll on human lives as if anybody would object to that in any way and without taking into consideration the historical context the fact that it takes 2 or more to go to war that all european monarchies were against the french revolution and democracy and declared wars multiple times to france even when france was negotiating for peace but once again when talent is lost only inglorious battles are left  lastly the soundtrack is mediocre and does not match the century and the scenes with some beats reminiscent of gladiator  the only saving grace about this waste of time the costumes and the sets
Dec 18 2023,positive,surprisingly funny and thoroughly entertaining
Dec 18 2023,negative,napoleon was ridley scotts sad attempt to emulate stanley kubrick  just go watch barry lyndon instead of this junk
Dec 18 2023,positive,saw the movie today it was very interesting and at times sad and funny for those of you who look wellplaned movies with the some interesting parts joaquin phoenix was great
Dec 18 2023,positive,phoenix not the right guy for the job war battles well done overall good not great
Dec 18 2023,positive,some battle seems are hard to watch
Dec 17 2023,negative,while the battle scenes were engaging the movie jumped rapidly from era to era sometimes providing very little to tie two consecutive eras together in a meaningful way joaquin phoenix plays an uncoordinated introverted simp who bears no resemblance to the actual napoleon no charisma no tactical brilliance nothing if i hadnt been with a friend id have walked out of the theater
Dec 17 2023,neutral,a move which opened with a strong scene to bring the audience in slowly fizzled out into a tale concerning ones lengths to go for love a move regarding napoleon may never be able to do it justice and although this movie features astounding scenes of the brutality of war it fails to deliver in painting the picture of the full napoleon you read about struggling from an apparent indecisiveness of whether to be a war movie or a love tale this movie can be summed up as ridley scotts best attempt at a large budgeted michael bay film on top of that joaquin phoenixs inability to don an accent to at least fit into the role with his counterparts truly displayed this movies attempt at creating a story and its subsequent failure to do so at the very least this movie is entertaining so feel free to see it if you have a lot of time and not much else to do with it
Dec 17 2023,negative,absolutely awful i only gave two stars because there was a battle scene that was done well and caught my attention other than that the movie was horribly written writers had an opportunity to make this a slam dunk an interesting story good actors but they fumbled big time the whole movie was nothing but separate scenes jumbled together with no transition or real story between them extremely hard to follow the movie or understand what was going on i learned absolutely nothing about napoleon also he was not portrayed to be a bad ass instead he was made to look timid and weak and pathetic nothing like his reputation so disappointing couldve really been a great movie if youre considering seeing this for yourself just know there was one point i told my husband id rather just go home and watch hulu and we almost walked out halfway through i wouldnt waste the time or money
Dec 17 2023,positive,5 stars movie very graphical
Dec 17 2023,positive,loved the action the realism and the amazing battle scenes especially the austerlitz scene
Dec 17 2023,negative,fails both as a historical film and as a film that wants to explore napoleon as a character beyond the battlefield  inaccurate and i refuse to recommend a film about napoleon where is not mentioned nelson the campaign in italy the disaster in egypt trafalgar and much more
Dec 17 2023,positive,didnt know what to expect  but enjoyed it
Dec 17 2023,positive,i liked this movie but the lack of the proper accents and not enough battle scenes is what i didnt like i wouldve like to have seen more of his battle strategies
Dec 17 2023,positive,it was not what i expected although i should have known with joaguin phoenix it would be a little weird there was uncomfortable sex scenes in it especially for watching in a theater i did learn ablot about napolean though i like the history and the costumes where very good
Dec 17 2023,negative,a random sequence of episodes poorly connected to each other leaving the less than highly educated person in napoleon history confused and lost  poor choice of emphasis on napoleons character during the movie and missing completely on his unique brilliance as a military strategist and his science seeking mind
Dec 17 2023,negative,as a parody it barely makes it characters are underdeveloped and the story line is strange given the subject matter a missed opportunity
Dec 17 2023,neutral,the movie was about a war general who won many wars on the battlefield this movie focused to much on the wars in the bedroom then his fights at the end it said he fought 61 wars and we only saw 3 dont watch unless you are very board or if you have a kid
Dec 17 2023,negative,a slow film that tells a great story its a shame that this story was poorly told  phoenix performance is spectacular he hasnt lost his touch  it could have been a good film but it wasnt
Dec 17 2023,positive,its a nicely shot production with strong actors but the narrative heart and contextual information for crucial events are lost to anyone who isnt a french historian
Dec 17 2023,positive,i wanted more i enjoyed the period piece aspect needed more context regarding the history and who was who i did like some of the dry humor the love story was intriguing but i needed more of this as well
Dec 17 2023,positive,definite must see movie captivating from the second it starts to the final scene epically done riveting and brilliantly executed
Dec 17 2023,negative,i guess if youre apple producing movies now you can do whatever you want because youre 3 trillion company but this had a lot of facts that were completely wrong the acting was mediocre and the story was a joke
Dec 17 2023,neutral,2 battles for 3 hours walked out with an hour left
Dec 17 2023,positive,its napoleon what can i say
Dec 17 2023,positive,critics are wrong  great film
Dec 17 2023,negative,too long no story too many battle scenes boring good cinematography
Dec 17 2023,positive,the war scenes were very good it wasnt as slow as others had said i went in with low expectations because other reviews  were discouraging the use of sex wasnt vulgar as one said it was rather realistic considering when it comes down to war and power generally they relate to sex
Dec 17 2023,positive,too brutally violent for me
Dec 17 2023,negative,long and slow not a good combination
Dec 17 2023,neutral,not convincing despite so much talent no depth
Dec 17 2023,negative,scott and phoenix fail to give the audience any reason to care about the films characters so what follows is a tedious and disjointed french history lesson
Dec 16 2023,positive,i enjoyed finding out things i did not know about him and all the events that occurred
Dec 16 2023,negative,boring movie and i love history
Dec 16 2023,negative,why would ridley scott turn the worlds greatest general into a horny 14 year old boy and have the entire entire movie focus on him wanting to have sex
Dec 16 2023,neutral,very good battle scenes great cinematography very unsatisfying superficial  character development
Dec 16 2023,positive,very well told story excellent acting and outstanding soundtrack
Dec 16 2023,positive,joachim phoenix was terrific as napoleon having just the right amount of audacity and attitude  though historical liberties may have been taken the movie was riveting and kept my family thoroughly engaged the special effects were amazing and convincing
Dec 16 2023,neutral,jaquin is an amazing actor but the rest was pretty lame
Dec 16 2023,negative,napoleon in the marvel universe    save your money and watch it on tv  someone may even like the movie but the movie is bad see that they are different things  whoever found a good movie maybe they should do an urgent skull scan    the movie doesnt work it has no plot it has no context it seems like its a collage of scenes independent of each other    in the end the feeling is of waste a gigantic production excellent costumes wellproduced battles from a visual point of view    to get out a mambembe and cliché thing its almost like napoleon in the marvel universe leading a cavalry charge in the middle of the battle of waterloo     if you want to be kind to ridley scott although i dont think he deserves it because he is very arrogant he was a victim of the magnitude of the story i wanted to tell condensing 25 years of events in 160 minutes it didnt work and it got worse which would already be difficult     this is remarkable in the films omissions the film simply even mentions spain the battle of trafalgar ney or murat
Dec 16 2023,negative,it was the worst movie i have seen in years dont bother spending the money long drawn out babble  not to mention inappropriate sexual scenes that were not necessary  the dialogue was terrible difficult to hear and looooong not a historical epic or a perverse love story yuck
Dec 16 2023,positive,overall it was a good movie not great but solid  focused too much on his love life with josephine and not his genius battle techniques and ways of conquering  would have liked to seen more battle scenes and more strategic planning for war joaquin phoenix did a good job playing napoleon but i expected a more serious tone from him after all napoleon did almost conquer everything
Dec 16 2023,negative,slow moving boring  my wife fell asleep  mis casting of napoleon  he was terrible
Dec 16 2023,negative,very slow and seemed to focus on his relationship with josephine more than i expected  wouldve liked to have seen more of his conquests
Dec 16 2023,positive,fantastic movie with some amazing battle scenes excellent performance from jp who played the part of nepoleon very well me and the missus were hooked from start to finish
Dec 16 2023,positive,it fails to tell a compelling story the film is mostly concentrated on a few nice war scenes and napoleons sex life
Dec 16 2023,negative,seems to me like ridley scott didnt care to make a movie about a french emperor who led one of the most successful empires in history instead i was forced to watch an uncomfortable 2 hour porn film about a sensitive sex addict how do we go from blade runner to this garbage     truly disappointed    truly disappointed
Dec 16 2023,negative,only hollywood bs a mockery of history a mockery of a movie and a mockery of my time
Dec 16 2023,negative,no character development no cohesion in the story and no drama anywhere in the movie the few battle scenes are interesting and well made but theres plenty of other movies where thats the case lets not even talk about historical inaccuracies feels more like the director was mad at the french and just made a cheap hit peace maybe he got rejected by a french girl once
Dec 16 2023,negative,battle scenes were very done but this was not the movie i saw advertised in the trailer it was a huge let down it wasnt the acting i feel like the script was lacking and they did the best they could with it
Dec 16 2023,negative,napoleon   for a film where the protagonist has the word boner in his name this is the flop of the year  very disappointing as scott and phoenix are masters of their craft however it lacked their usual cutting edge  there was hardly a french word spoken and not even an attempt to incorporate an accent by any of the cast   it felt like a romcom where they wanted to cast the joker for this role not phoenix   it lacked any build up to the major historical events of the time and what shouldcould have been a historical epic masterpiece was instead an epic fail
Dec 16 2023,neutral,movie is like reading the extreme cliff notes version on napoleon with glossing over so many important events and played by an actor a bit too old for the part this is one of ridley scotts less impressive films 
Dec 16 2023,positive,a historic look at napoleon bonaparte i am a history buff  i did enjoy learning more about the general but there were times i wasnt clear on the plot at hand on the screen   if you dont like history i would not advise watching because i like history  places confused me about what was occuring
Dec 16 2023,positive,very interesting about him with his rise and fall i did learn quite a bit about him ego and personality
Dec 16 2023,negative,horrible boring movie left before it was over had so much potential and they dropped the ball
Dec 16 2023,neutral,less war and more creepy love story than we expected
Dec 16 2023,positive,the story was very interesting the actions did an excellent job
Dec 15 2023,negative,i dont know what to even say about this movie it was boring it was long it seems like you started the movie in a midway point where you dont know whats going on and did joaquin phoenix just forget how to act or was mad that he was playing the part none of it was good
Dec 15 2023,negative,action scenes dont disappoint but storyline was way too dramatised and probably factually incorrect
Dec 15 2023,negative,movie was great cinematography and special effects on battle scenes 15  but too much drama on napoleon and josephenes love life 85  nothing that demonstrated his military genius no info on battle plans strategies leadership nothing on the disastrous retreat from moscow nothing on the empire he built prior to his fall nothing about the louisiana purchase by jefferson and no details about reasons for his loss at waterloo  far too little on nothing and nothing on what really mattered to history
Dec 15 2023,negative,this movie is simply nonsense from the start to how long i could watch it 1h30 out of the 2h30  it has everything wrong from historical facts to an outrageous focus on napoleons sexual life and a massive bias across the board depicting him as simply put a psychopath and tyrant    i feel deeply ashame for the scriptwriter who butchered a complex chapter of european history  fyi this is the first time in 30 years i have ever write a movie review online thats how bad this movie is and i watched hundreds  if you have the courage to stress test this review and have read about who napoleon was best of luck to finish the movie 
Dec 15 2023,negative,movie should have been named josephine  a very small footnote in the life of napoleon   absolutely no  account of napoleons military strategic genius
Dec 15 2023,positive,its a good movie a littlle slow and you have been thé best things already in the trailer
Dec 15 2023,positive,the love story was interesting
Dec 15 2023,positive,i really enjoyed this movie and think it did a great job at highlighting napoleons life without feeling the need to stop at every single detail while that means it did leave out some things and left other things just unsaid i appreciated the pacing the enjoyed the movie i do think it would pretty hard to include a lot of battle scenes which were beautifully shot and left out some things as a result to get them all into the movie overall great movie
Dec 15 2023,positive,really gruesome not for light hearted viewers 85 true to wikipedia read interested in visiting france near future 
Dec 15 2023,positive,vastly underrated truly an epic moviethe battle scenes are off the scale i cant wait for the 4 hour version
Dec 15 2023,negative,this movie was so bad it made me created a rotten tomatoes account to warn people not to see it it should have been called napoleon and josephine or napoleonjosephines bh the movie focused on their relationship instead of how the man went from nothing to conquering everything it completely skipped his time in italy and how he rose to power one of the worst movies ive seen in a long long time there are no better words i can think of to describe how disappointed i was with this movie
Dec 15 2023,positive,it was a very cinematographically beautiful movie showing napoleon as a very smart and fierce general while showing his vulnerability with his love for josephine 
Dec 15 2023,positive,choppy it left me feeling flat the wars were confusing the conversations were short  didnt explain what was happening
Dec 15 2023,negative,ridley scott is amazing but this story is too big for a movie i wish hed made it into a series instead like another reviewer said it feels like a slideshow  not up to his usual standards
Dec 15 2023,positive,one of the best and most epic historical masterpieces ive ever seen the acting was incredible it was surprisingly funny and i thought the battle scenes were incredible the only complaint i have is that i think the movie was a little too long but i highly recommend watching napoleon
Dec 14 2023,negative,it could have been epic but film lacked continuity and never got a sense of the man story disjointed
Dec 14 2023,positive,felt rushed and poor personal story development
Dec 14 2023,positive,good movie kind of rushed couldve used more war 
Dec 14 2023,negative,i left the movie thinking what was the whole point of it and how do i get my 9 back  there were a few good battle scenes but there was no real substance to the movie napoleon and josephine were miscast with phoenix and kirby  even evertt came off as a caricature all fine actors but none of them were able to pull off the roles   its one thing for a writer or director to use creative license but when you change the story like having napoleon blow up the pyramids which never happened thats just bad writing  it was way too long with no payout at the end  i suggest you wait for it to steam if you really want to see it
Dec 14 2023,negative,i watched this movie with other members of my family some of whom are history buffs other not so much all of us however could agree that this movie was boring incredibly boring putting aside all of the historical inaccuracies shoddy acting and the plot being crammed into what seemed more like a napoleon slideshow than a historical epic this movie is still a jumbled mess the pacing is awful with the first 45 minutes of the film solely being dedicated to showing napoleons rise to dominance and his courting of josephine the problem is it detracts heavily from the rest of his life this man fought wars against seven coalitions won 38 of the 43 battles he participated in and dominated the vast majority of europe so how does ridley scott honour the achievments of the greatest general the world has ever known    he covers 3 battles toulouse austerlitz and waterloo     now you may be thinking wow three battles in a single movie thats awesome unfortunately they are extremely shallow and void of any tension austerlitz was the standout of the three and was admittedly cinematically beautiful but waterloo was utterly horrific there was no tension no suspense no nothing they even got the events of the battle wrong apart from one cavalry charge    did i mention that waterloo toulouse and austerlitz commanded about 30 minutes of screen time total maybe even less i cant remember that well since i was looking at my phone for the last 15 minutes of the movie    the dialogue was weird really really weird at one point napoleon meets with a british ambassador to offer peace when the british decline he loudly exclaims word for word you think youre so great because you have boats he then storms off and the scene ends the love story between napoleon and josephine should have been an insight into the type of person napoleon was behind closed doors instead it was a place for napoleon to pretend to be a horse charging into bed to make love to his empress this actually happened and it is awkward there were no memorable characters apart from napoleon and josephine who were forced down your eye sockets for 2 hours     frustratingly the acting wasnt overly good either joaquin phoenix in the opinion of everyone ive talked to who has seen the movie was miscast for this role he did an alright job here and there but was deadpan and serious for the majority of it rather than the grandiose figure people percieved napoleon to be that would be all well and good if ridley scott was trying to show the real napoleon but any emotional scene falls flat on its face     this was also insultingly american for a movie about a french emperor he uses miles instead of kilometers or yards he speaks along with every french character in this film in an american accent the only actors who speak in their depicted countries language are a few russian cossacks for 5 seconds in the entire film and once the english joined in during the battle of waterloo it was difficult to distinguish who was who because everybody apart from rupert everett sounded exactly the same toss in the fact that napoleon apparently was stupid enough to charge into battle himself and the french army being completely useless at waterloo and you have a good case to call this a frenchhate movie     finally the director writers and the movie itself couldnt decide on who napoleon was he wasnt an inspiring worldbeating general he wasnt an egomaniac who wanted to rule the world he wasnt a villain who the coalition had to destory and he wasnt the saviour of france i couldnt root for a protagonist like napoleon because there was nothing to relate to him with it was awful character development which i have come to expect from ridley scott after his past few flops the movie even ends with text that states that napoleon participated in x number of battles i thought to myself hell yeah we are gonna see just how dominant he was on the battlefield and get actual stats to back it up instead it pulled up the names of seven battles and the casualties of each battle along with the total casualty count for the entire reign of napoleon bonaparte cool    there was even a scene in which napoleon makes peace with the russian emperor alexander i which cuts back to a completely unrelated scene that lasts 2 minutes then cuts to napoleon marching off to war against russia because alexander apparently betrayed himthis was only 2 or 3 minutes after he had just made peace with him hell the invasion of russia the burning of moscow the disastrous retreat from russia napoleons resignation his exile and his return are covered in 10 minutes or less like what in the actual     the best way i can describe this movie is the way my sibling put it it feels like a movie someone made by just looking at dotpoint facts about napoleon from his wikipedia page this movie is an insult to france to historians to movie goers and to napoleon himself if you are a fan of good cinematography maybe wait until its on a streaming service to watch it otherwise stay far far away
Dec 14 2023,negative,better than the marvels worse than barbie
Dec 14 2023,positive,i liked it very much one of those movies that keeps lingering after its done  josephine was the star of the movie
Dec 14 2023,positive,this epic historical drama directed and produced by ridley scott is based on the story of napoleon bonaparte and primarily depicts the french leaders rise and fall  and his relentless journey to power as well as his addictive volatile relationship with empress joséphine if you are looking for a summarized biopic for a homework or are interested in napoleons history this might be the perfect film to get you started it presents historical facts with great accuracy and it might be one of the best napoleon films out there the thrilling battle scenes are praiseworthy and the marvelous production and costume design are especially worth mentioning joaquin phoenix is excellent as always and vanessa kirby is equally mesmerizing but i would have liked to see more of her the soundtrack is okay with great martin phipps tracks and if the rumours of a 4hour cut are true i hope it fills in the gaps of a seemingly incomplete film and makes it a really epic experience because scotts theatrical cut should have been better
Dec 14 2023,positive,the acting and historical battles were done well  it was a little long but still entertaining
Dec 14 2023,positive,napoleon as husband is a boring portrayal long battle scenes were very good
Dec 13 2023,positive,it is a nice concept of course to talk about napoleons great leadership and achievements however as there is so much cloth to cut from there are missing elements at the end of the storyline and some scenes feel hollow including reasons for battling some armies overall good performances and scenery and a pretty great biography for people that have a somewhat clear idea about who napoleon is and about war
Dec 13 2023,positive,interesting history on napoleon story
Dec 13 2023,positive,cant vouch for the historical accuracy but it was an interesting film and the battle sequences were very well done
Dec 13 2023,negative,garbage was exited for this movie and genre at the very least refreshing to see hollywood produce something thats not a scifibut this was a failure really odd movie all around from its pace to how they chose to lay out the story to the acting watching people portray the french with english accents is totally weird especially when there is english people in the movie as part of the story they could have at least attempted accents or even better use french actors the movie is choppy and stale completely bland some of the battle scenes are pretty good but nothing extraordinary the dialogue is bizzare and jp delivers his lines so odd it reminded me of the guy portraying the bad actor in the liberty mutual insurance commercials hes obviously a great actor so it was weird to see this style from him    overall just a very uninspiring boring and bland movie
Dec 13 2023,positive,i appreciated the scenery the action and the history lesson the love story between napoleon and josephine was unexpected i agree with many reviewers that the film just moved along without much of a story aside from napoleons quest for an heir
Dec 13 2023,negative,my favourite bookmovietv genre is historical fiction so i was excited to see this movie and was prepared to love it love it i did not this movie was a bizarre amalgamation of a latin american daytime drama the romance and a really dry reenactment of all his major battles for a truly good movie i think the audience has to get to know the protagonist and either has to care about or deeply dislike them unfortunately this movie depicts napoleon as a twodimensional mumbling emotionally abusive eccentric leading the audience to not understand much of what he is saying or care one way or the other what happens to him although we all know of course
Dec 13 2023,negative,one of the worst ive watched and typically love this type of movie
Dec 13 2023,positive,informative and very well done
Dec 13 2023,positive,forget about the negative boring reviews  this movie is riveting beautiful cinematography great acting and very heartfelt and not at all boringi almost didnt see this in the theatre because of negative reviewshistory wise i believe fairly accuratebut pretty sure you would need to be a french historian to know who caresjoaquin  is brilliant and has so much emotion for this parthe puts his heart and soul into every job he does i am a person  that loves new orleansthere is a restaurant called the napoleon househe was invited there but sadly he died in exile and never got therei highly recommended this moviei am a huge ridley scott fanif this happens to be his last movie he was genius as alwaysgo see it 
Dec 13 2023,positive,this is the best movie of the year joaquim phoenix and vanessa kirby do a pretty good duo and we dont care about historical inconsistencies that is a biopic ridley scott did a good movie
Dec 13 2023,negative,so maybe i am not the intended audience for this movie i went to see it with my dad which was a bit awkward due to all the sex scenes but genuinely can someone tell me if i was supposed to walk away from that movie liking napoleon or feeling sympathetic toward him joaquin phoenixs portrayal of him was so off putting and gross i dont even understand how or why josephine loved him and the movie was largely about their relationship
Dec 13 2023,positive,breathtaking cinematography and great action scenes and incredible costume design  its even better the second time
Dec 13 2023,positive,i loved this movie  i didnt go for a history education  i went for entertainment value and that was amazing  the cinematography and camera angle creativity was very good definitely see this one on the big screen  there is no comparison
Dec 13 2023,positive,say what you want about the pop psychology value of birth order but there is something to it when i can finish watching napoleon and say to myself scott is a middle child and kubrick is first born and then prove myself right thru wikipedia research     barry lyndon is first born kubricks substitute for napoleon which he lost financing for when de laurentiis 1970 waterloo tanked at the box office if youve ever been to a kubrick museum exhibit with his million cardcard catalogs and meticulous set notes you can see his first born perfectionism at work the same when you watch barry lyndon shot in candlelight every closeup is perfection you can almost feel the 75 take tension of the actors  please god let this be it meanwhile watching a ridley scott film is like the filming equivalent of throwing spaghetti at the wall and seeing what sticks i can be every good as kubrick scott is every bit as entertaining sometimes more so because his pacing is less suffocating his delivery less exacting but substance and ambience and finesse often suffer  he definitely does not suffer from the imposter syndrome of first bornes but does have that fear of living in the shadow i will be louder longer bigger and thats how you know youre watching a ridley scott production  accuracyrelevancy be damned     every third scene in napoleon the actors are so backlit you cant even see their faces you can picture scott shrugging and waving off concerns they know who it is they just saw them in the last scene next the same with phoenixs portrayal of napoleon it feels like he made him up as he went along and scott was perfectly fine with that whatever it was the 1790s nobody knew what he was really like and kids today dont read who is going to complain lets blow something up maniacally careening from set to set ready set action roll film cut excellent next     take an italian  with you to the movie they will help you enjoy the humor of the film youll know what i mean during the dining room scene whomever choreographed that was inspired
Dec 13 2023,negative,awful mr scott should stick to the science fiction genre where he shines
Dec 13 2023,positive,it followed history very closely  the acting was awesome
Dec 13 2023,positive,this film had the potential to be one of the best of the year for many reasons most notably the fact that the film tells the story of one of the most important people in history after one of the most important moments in history the film has an amazing cast  very good photography a good soundtrack and good editing and the costumes are stunning but unfortunately none of these topics stifle the films biggest problem the script the dialogues are good but the context makes them strange and creates a certain antipathy by several characters and ends up creating relationships that are very difficult to swallow
Dec 13 2023,positive,a bigbudget spectacle reminiscent of the bigbudget productions of the 1950s
Dec 13 2023,negative,seems to be a cheap budget stage play type movie stars and actors were awful i wasted 30 bucks
Dec 13 2023,positive,have to see in imax epic movie
Dec 13 2023,negative,bitterly disappointed the acting notwithstanding this effort centered more on the relationship between napoleon and josephine than the historical significance of one of the greatest figures in the history of the world  his thoughts planning and strategy were constantly overshadowed by sexual innuendo  the screenwriter producer and director should be ashamed
Dec 12 2023,positive,captivating and suspenseful beautiful film walking phoenix the best yet 
Dec 12 2023,positive,really well done movie very cool especially if you love that history period cant wait to it again and it was less than 3 hours plus
Dec 12 2023,negative,noone cares about his lovelife unless you want to make a cheaper movie and not focus on the warfare
Dec 12 2023,positive,i didnt really come out this learning or feeling more for napoleon i didnt get a single glimpse into his past and how it may have guided his actions aside from the way his love life affected him i dont get his true motivation for what he does i wasnt really ingrained with the character and i dont think this is the actors fault but instead the writers    its a lovely film in terms of the cinematography the actionbattle scenes were interesting and it had some good humor
Dec 12 2023,positive,for what it is i think its near perfect but since its based on true events i think there is a limit to how good it can be but still i think it does show napoleons legacy well and it does show his true character i think the battle in russia was bountiful with the use of blood in the ocean looking perfect by far best part of the movie i think there is a bit to much sex scenes or at least more then was needed to prove its point    in conclusion good movie and great history movie i would recommend
Dec 12 2023,negative,the movie tried the overachieve and skipped a lot of intriguing historical events or detailed them way to short i was constantly hoping for great comeback but that did not arrive apple should refrain from making historical movies in my opinion because the movie had an vague  we dislike napoleon vibe to it
Dec 12 2023,negative,came in expecting a great history movie and came out disappointed to much useless stuff and not enought on important event also really hard to follow at times and i dont like josephine at all
Dec 12 2023,positive,great acting but the story was all over the place hard to keep up with timelines
Dec 12 2023,negative,why did ridley scott chose to make this film so drab looking every scene looked so dull and muted find the waterloo battle scene online and watch that but you can complete avoid the rest of it
Dec 12 2023,negative,movie was advertised as a tactical war movie but  was 60 poorly written nonengaging rom com the battle scenes were the only good aspect of the movie and its a real shame more of this movie wasnt battles that highlight napoleons tactics some of which are still studied today the time jumping was poorly done and often a scene would be negated by the very next time jump the director also apparently couldnt decide if this was a serious movie or a comedy which made for whiplash in tone this is the first movie that had me wanting to walk out and would not recommend to anyone
Dec 12 2023,negative,a lackluster cinematic dudi didnt realize this was going to be a fictional comedy
Dec 12 2023,positive,apart from historical inaccuracies that were apparently galore this was a strange movie that seemed hellbent on deconstructing napoleon as somewhat of a joke and pathetic man both on and off battlefield and in his interpersonal and amorous relations a sense of awkward comedy applied more widely to the setting of revolutionary france in the movie it had a mildly ridiculous montypython quality possibly the expression of an englishmans stereotypical view of france as for napoleon i could not appreciate his military genius either as innate talent or as quickly grasped skill also the acting seemed strangely wooden in the beginning but it could have also been the shtick of the movie  anyways while the movie was entertaining enough it left very little imprint if this was meant to show a flawed legend it depicted mainly flaws the legend stuff was implied offscreen
Dec 12 2023,negative,a disappointing and convoluted mess of a film that in spite of ridleys now unfortunately trademark blue historyfilter looks amazing thanks to its attention to detail impressive battle scenes and excellent framing the script however is so stuffed and fragmented that by the end of it it still isnt clear who napoleon was why he even loved josephine nor whether and why he actually loved france
Dec 12 2023,negative,the movie was dull as was the lead actor left during a humping scene without nudity
Dec 12 2023,negative,ridley scotts grandiose historical epic on napoleon reminds me of a history paper submitted by a student who has copied and pasted most of it from wikipedia while theres no doubt scott can stage a tremendously visual and visceral battle scene sometimes almost mercilessly violent for our viewing pleasure david scarpas unwieldy screenplay which begins with the beheading of marie antoinette tries to cover too much spreads itself too thin and comes across shallow and superficial against a lavish production history accurate or embellished is mostly played out like a farce while napoleon and josephines tumultuous romance is scripted like an unintentionally funny soap opera all this could potentially be a recipe for some camptastic fun but any chance of that is scuppered by a listless performance from joaquin phoenix who underplays the titular character his napoleon seems lethargic and deflated most of the time even when hes winning devoid of charisma or substance he leaves the film anchorless with a gaping hole in the middle vanessa kirbys josephine fares better by comparison but still ive seen better actresses out there in this busy oscar season in fact the only one who makes an impression and knows what kind of film hes really in is rupert everrett and his disdainful duke of wellington while interchangeable british and the occasional french thespians drop in and out to play historical figures that are rendered mostly insignificant or just confusing in a screenplay that might have worked better if it isnt so ambitious andor dull at the same time stumbling head first into parody with dialogue that imagines napoleon grandstanding that destiny brought him a lamb chop i cant help but feel that its ridley who has brought us a turkey albeit an expensivelooking one instead
Dec 12 2023,positive,the film critic i saw got it wrong i thought character development was good i learned a bit about history i shouldve know as a younger man the depiction of war back then was brutal  and probably not brutal enough to accurately depict the hell of war
Dec 12 2023,positive,joaquin was great fight scenes were great story was lacking detail
Dec 12 2023,positive,the book gives you his entire life the movie shows small portions of some of his battles most of the movie was about his love life empress josephine
Dec 12 2023,positive,joaquin phoenix shins  but the story is very disjointed  really just a string of 15 minute vignettes that dont seem connected  i was expecting so much more  but it did not come close to my expectations
Dec 12 2023,negative,this movie should be titled 3hours of hot garbage     if i wanted to watch two people drinking tea in a castle for 3hours i would go visit my parents at one point i actually fell asleep i fell asleep in a ridley scott movie
Dec 12 2023,positive,the movie was as epic as history itself i found it fascinating and riveting if youre not a fan of history it might not be as interesting to you
Dec 12 2023,positive,i almost didnt go and see this movie because i read a lot of negative reviews about it but i recently read a historical fiction book about josephine so i really was interested after seeing the movie i cant understand why people didnt like it more it was beautifully shot from battlefield to ballroom to bedroom a gorgeous peek into one of the most notorious figures of all time yes it is long but it covers a lot of history it showed arrogance confidence genius madness obsession  all the things that napoleon was i loved it
Dec 11 2023,negative,what chore must have taken mr p about 10 minutes to learn his lines
Dec 11 2023,negative,perhaps the director and screenwriters could even look at the wikipedia article on napoleon  the figure of napoleon is one of the most portrayed in films literature even learned in all schools at least in the west  the film portrays a fiction so unbelievable that it only seeks to shock  the cannon shot at the great pyramid could only be unnoticed by a primary school child  perhaps one of ridley scotts worst films ever
Dec 11 2023,negative,three hours of your life you wont get back lead actor is pretty bad and the fact he alone speaks american english when all others have british accent is comical cant hire a dialect coach when getting paid so much inquiring mind wants to know
Dec 11 2023,positive,i enjoyed it i didnt know what a great war general napoleon was and how insecure he was about his wife and her affairs
Dec 11 2023,positive,a history lesson about a complicated troubled man but brilliant field general  battle scenes well done
Dec 11 2023,positive,the filming locations and cinematography were great the story was historic and i learned quite a bit about napoleon the acting was soso
Dec 11 2023,neutral,i was bored a good portion of the time the background music was distracting i did not get a feel from the way napoleon was portrayed that he could have been a leader strong enough to lead the armies of france the scenery and the actual historical timeline were positive points
Dec 11 2023,positive,very violent quite longjuaquin phoenix excellent   he deserves a nod the movie not among the best of this year
Dec 11 2023,negative,it was a bad movie without a real story line there was no real dialogue and too much freedom was taken from the historical facts   napoleons depicting was grotesque and the movie was too much focused on josephine
Dec 11 2023,negative,one of the worst movies ive ever seen  if you go for porn you will get it if you go to find out about napoleon you will be greatly disappointed  phoenix is a good actor but not a good choice for napoleon  the script had no depth so i learned nothing about that time period or napoleon  i was embarrassed to be sitting in the theater
Dec 11 2023,negative,the battle scenes were fantastic could win an oscar for cinematography but ridley scott failed at character development   i didnt love or hate anyone i kind of didnt  like napoleon but i sort of respected his military genius i kind of liked but sort of despised josephine he assumed we all were experts in french history he didnt explain any of the campaigns or napoleons end game   i told my wife mid movie if this was narrated by morgan freeman it would be great   it was not   someone should write a narrative and have morgan freeman read it over the movie that would be awesome   without it its not worth your time   dont misunderstand me this movie wasnt bad it was terrible
Dec 11 2023,neutral,it was like watching a history book the battles were cool and there are some interesting moments between it just felt weird from going from event to event without a great story between them
Dec 11 2023,positive,two stories the french war and his love for josephine i didnt understand he issue about him having an heir did he get married a second time
Dec 11 2023,negative,boring showed more about how he had sex then how he strategize for war
Dec 11 2023,negative,it should have been called the battles of napoleon  the battles are boring and really do not get to napoleon the man  there is some insight into the man but in depth  i think it would have been far more interesting
Dec 11 2023,positive,the movie is of course not a documentary historical accuracy lets say that it is not a focus point of the movie but i have enjoyed the movie phoenix has once again proven to be one of the truly great actors of today the visuals are superb as with all ridleys work the relationship between napoleon and josephine is the focal point of the movie and i found it well executed
Dec 11 2023,positive,this was a really good movie
Dec 11 2023,negative,it was like going to a superbowl party and rather than seeing a game it was a presentation for an audience only interested in uniform team colors and gossip of personal affairs   to make matters worse the overpriced popcorn and drink are a poor substitute for the awesome food normally accompanied by a real superbowl party   this movie is a complete waste of money and time unless you are the kind of person who likes to watch the view and thinks joy behar is an intellectual genius
Dec 11 2023,positive,absolutely fantastic movie battle scenes where amazing
Dec 11 2023,positive,the characters of napoleon and josephine lacked enough depth and true affection the 2nd wife appeared in one scene only battle scenes were grandly done but the reason for going to war at all was not made readily apparent it lacked in providing enough historical perspective apparently certain scenes were deleted for time and will be added back in for streaming versions later
Dec 11 2023,negative,not what i expected as a history professional i expected so much more on napoleon and his  military strategies instead it was raunchy and more on him and josephine
Dec 11 2023,positive,overall i enjoyed it especially the battle scenes which were very well done but it felt rushed and the storyline isnt particularly gripping the only characters that are developed enough to care about are napolean and josephine and while their relationship was intriguing it too fell a bit flat i left the theater feeling like i knew a bit more about napoleans history but thats about it its hard to say what the film lacked but id say its probably cohesion not a movie ill be watching again
Dec 11 2023,negative,what a snoozer i couldnt stand to be in theater and walked out about a little more than half way  so disappointed in how boring this was
Dec 11 2023,positive,about what i expected  it was loud and bloody  i hated the killed horses
Dec 10 2023,positive,cinematography  i loved the history lesson
Dec 10 2023,positive,easy to follow the historical chronology of events and battles  personalized interactions between napoleon  and his wife josephine  battle scenes and sequences were extraordinary if some a bit too long  scenery and special effects extraordinaire
Dec 10 2023,negative,the battle scenes were good but the only scene with any emotional resonance was when josephines daughter told napoleon she had died the script and dialogue was abysmal which may be why the actors performances were so poor there was little chemistry between the actors and the sex scenes were just unpleasant where was the motivation for the characters actions there was not enough nuance back story or genuine emotion to care about any of the characters or understand what made them tick skip this movie read a book about napoleon instead
Dec 10 2023,positive,the movie is wellmade especially the battle scenes but theres so much history to cover and much of it is covered too superficially  also i think joaquin phoenix is a brilliant actor but i dont think he was able to figure out this role  and the business with napoleons relationship with josephine simply didnt work  it was one of those movies that i thought was a failure but im still glad i saw it
Dec 10 2023,positive,battle scenes were epic but the storyline was weak  you made napoleon look like a dunce which isnt at all accurate
Dec 10 2023,positive,overall its a good movie the war scenes are incredible the problem he has is that focusing so much on his relationship with his wife was not very interesting and phoenixs performance is very stiff a real mistake
Dec 10 2023,positive,joaquin phoenix is riveting as always bringing life to napoleon as only he could the movie is unpredictable in every way from the rawness of the era to the staging of the battle scenes to how important milestones are treated battle scenes are epic felt like i needed to brush the dirt from my shirt there was little to love with josephine flawlessly played by
Dec 10 2023,positive,great fighting scenesand actingbut to long
Dec 10 2023,negative,the only good thing about this movie is the production efforts costumes sets music all good phoenix et als performance is dull the story seems to be a simple highlights compilation and its truly a waste of time
Dec 10 2023,negative,the movie seemed to be more of a melodrama than a depiction of napoleon  they spent hours on the flawed relationship between he and josephine and then threw in a couple of quick battles scenes to say yah i think he fought in some wars too  along with that the accuracy was so farfetched and ridiculous that it made it difficult to watch
Dec 10 2023,positive,it was slow  too much josephine  phoenix not charismatic enough no real exploration of his motivation
Dec 10 2023,positive,phoenix portrayal of napoleon was bit too close to his joker character  napoleon was loved by the french and fearedrespectedhated by the rest of the world  he would have had a larger than life personality  i think toby mcguire would have been a much better choice to play napoleon  this movie focuses bit too much on his romance to joséphine and their turbulent lovehate relationship  battlefield scenes werent quite as gruesome as some are suggesting  the cinematography and location made me go back in time to 1700s france  btw vanessa kirby merits oscar consideration for her portrayal of joséphine de beauharnais note if youre a history buff like i am youll like this movie  but if youre a regular joejane you may not appreciate it as much
Dec 10 2023,negative,nor epic nor historic to be it would need a narrative string there is no story just an empty pile in random scenes with no links between them that socalled film is a total ruin ridley scott is known to be able to make very good movies like gladiator to compare napoleon with it on a scale if 10 it deserve a big zero
Dec 10 2023,positive,i think it gets a bad rap the battle scenes are great and him and josephine were funny together joaquin is actually subversively funny in it without mocking the movie it wasnt spectacular but worth the time should prob get 80 not 58
Dec 10 2023,positive,phoenix does a decent job as napoleon but his character was mostly a lighter side of the joker  no one who leads a nation and is respected feared by the world would have had the personality portrayed by phoenix  tobey maguire would have been a much better choice to play napoleon  either way if youre not a history buff like me you likely wont appreciate this movie very much  btw i didnt think the battle field battles were quite as gruesome as some of these reviewers are saying  ps  i doubt phoenix will get nominated for an oscar but vanessa kirby deserves consideration as her portrayal of josphine was superb
Dec 10 2023,negative,many misleading historical errors and missed crucial points
Dec 10 2023,negative,quite boring scenes did not mesh together appearing to have different writing styles for each in some cases it seemed like it was done by the intern really disappointing and with a long run time still didnt teach you anything of the man
Dec 10 2023,negative,boring and poorly written
Dec 10 2023,negative,great wargame was displayed but the acting and the story itself made me feel awkward
Dec 10 2023,positive,its good that dates and places are noted as one needs to have good history of france and europe to follow at times
Dec 10 2023,positive,enjoyed learning some french history   roles of napoleon and josephene and their personalities played well
Dec 10 2023,positive,napoleon was one of those rare these days unforgettable epic movies  it was beautifully filmed and acted and the nearly 3 hours running timeoddlydid not seem overly long
Dec 10 2023,neutral,too long rather boring
Dec 10 2023,negative,was this acting i mean to say there was not much realistic drama and it was sad to see horses tortured in war this movie could have been shorter and well better  i guess i blame the script
Dec 10 2023,negative,the movie should have been called the uninspiring love life of napoleon and josephine really dont understand what angle they were trying to go down with this film or who it was supposed to appeal to its quite an accomplishment to make a story as fascinating as napoleons so boring felt no connection to any of the characters missed out great events phoenix was a poor napoleon and the script was terrible
Dec 10 2023,positive,i loved the historical context and the scenery was amazing the acting was really good but brace yourself for a long movie that might just cover too much of the time period to really understand the characters
Dec 10 2023,positive,story really should be a sixpart miniseries liked kirby not phoenix but scott is still one if my favorite directors theres always something interesting going on onscreen also best seen in a theater not at home on your tv
Dec 10 2023,positive,terrific acting job by joaquin phoenix    a bit too much gore  looked somewhat fake
Dec 10 2023,positive,a masterpiece in cinematography especially the battle and mansion sceans
Dec 10 2023,positive,we typically dont like period pieces but this movie is awesome a heartfelt relaying of multifaceted aspects of the human condition as played out informing the context of real historical events joaquin phoenix wow  the movie was great but he delivered a standout performance we loved him as cash in walk the line and had seen it several times but he makes you see  believe him as the totally different character of napoleon about two frames in could have done without some of the war  violence but this is wellknown as an especially bloody period of time so understandably would have been hard to avoid in the retelling worth closing your eyes occasionally to enjoy the rest great movie
Dec 10 2023,positive,its more about napoleons sex life rather than the story so meh
Dec 10 2023,positive,great movie im not a historian so can only take it on face value what i saw i really enjoyed   i think there may be some viewers who think of themselves as credited movie critics why the low score from them  idk i just hope they feel better in themselves after their review
Dec 10 2023,negative,it is a hate movie against france with multiple historical mistakes and inaccuracies the movie pace is slow and the characters lack personality there is not a clear path in the whole movie nor any good secondary actors that could save the whole thing a little it is a bad movie which is very surprising
Dec 10 2023,positive,martin phipps stuck his foot into that score
Dec 10 2023,negative,technically good movie showing accurate history and battle technique but the characters remained distant and unrelatable  i didnt like napoleon or josephine  there was emotional distance throughout the movie  disappointing
Dec 10 2023,negative,this movie was incredibly boring do not waste your time
Dec 10 2023,positive,epic battle scenes great special effects and an excellent performance by joaquin phoenix are notable highlights the storyline script and supporting character development could have been better ridley scotts attention to detail with historical cinema is among the best and napoleon is true to form
Dec 10 2023,negative,id rather have my head chopped off along side marie antoinette then watch this film again boring and uneventful with bland acting
Dec 10 2023,positive,pros great battle scenes beautiful scenery  cons too long wish movie had actually been with french actors the american and british actors speaking english pretending to be french
Dec 10 2023,negative,except for the well done battle scenes incredibly boring
Dec 10 2023,positive,the movie is more of a romance and less than the great epic that napoleon deserves
Dec 10 2023,positive,i heard of different miscues in the film and i guess there were gross errors all over but i thought the movie was somewhat darker than necessary light wise and the end was summarized troo fast   i did not like the overall entertainment   other than that it was just ok
Dec 10 2023,positive,excellent acting  a lot of war and death rightfully so because that was napoleons legacy  best aspect was ns relationship with josephine too long
Dec 10 2023,negative,ridley scott pulls a boner on this stinker he directing like hes plodding and boringly dull dishwater is more interesting than this movie 
Dec 10 2023,negative,the acting and directing is strong but the script is a mess never giving us any feel for who these people were often lingering too long on wars and racing through the human bits
Dec 10 2023,positive,too long sound inaudible
Dec 10 2023,positive,i like historical dramas which is why i went to see this but it was just ok to me maybe too large of scope  for 2 hours but i appreciated it i loved the costumes  really liked josephines performance
Dec 10 2023,negative,in a word tedious  not exactly bad acting  more like no acting  you literally  learned nothing about any of these historical figures  apparently napoleon josephine nor anyone in all of france ever smiled laughed yelled etcthat said this movie really failed due to really really bad story telling  i would have guessed it would be impossible to make such dramatic events boring sadly i was wrong  suggest anyone interested in this topic read a 15 minute summary  bad bad bad
Dec 9 2023,positive,the movie was good the story was interesting and the action was great the actors were brilliant its worth seeing 
Dec 9 2023,negative,really disappointing i was bored throughout most of the movie and had the urge to just stand up and leave it looks like they tried really hard and some aspects like the costumes and the music are certainly impressive but the story entirely lacks focus and seems utterly pointless the characters are very poorly developed and the story jumps from one weird episode to the next without any coherence
Dec 9 2023,positive,i went into this not really knowing much about napoleon the image in my mind of him since childhood was his portrayal by ian holm in 1981s time bandits i think this movie gave me a little bit more information about the man and his effects on history i found the depiction of his relationship with josephine interesting arousing and heartbreaking it used to bother me but now i expect and appreciate the now typical realistic lighting of scotts films i enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to people who like historical films
Dec 9 2023,positive,entertaining epic as a fan of historical periods i knew i would enjoy this film big battle scenes elaborate sets costumes over the top characters and a wonderful score as a history teacher for 30 yrs i can say tackling a subject like napoleon is challenging i thought ridley scott did a great job for the most part sure there are some holes but that doesnt take away from phoenixs performance or the story must see on the big screen
Dec 9 2023,positive,very good film in everything directingscreenplayactingcinematography
Dec 9 2023,positive,very very good movie in my opinion but im really biased since i love napoleon and history the story was really interesting and the tale of napoleon and josephine was really really enjoyable to watch
Dec 9 2023,positive,its my pleasure watching an epic movie in the big screen when recently movies going to tell small and smaller stories and simple subjects  however i believe  story and script is basic foundation in movies  i have some questions about napoleons story such ashow tims newspaper knows about josefins bedroom and also its not logical napoleon leaves war for his relatives the director and his  the script writer dont be attention about  to explain the details story    it seems the time of napoleon movie is a little more than standard and regular time in american but its not enough because scott wants to show a story about francerevolutionnapoleons warsrelatives between napoleon and josefin so this time really isnt enough
Dec 9 2023,positive,thoroughly enjoyed the superb acting lifelike battle scenes and the unbelievable scenery
Dec 9 2023,negative,ridley scott managed to get almost everything wrong in this farcical attempt to portray napoleon badly acted disjointed and sets out to demonise napoleon whilst getting almost every historical fact wrong parts of it are so bad its hard to believe any research was done at all eg infanty in a trench at waterloo there were none yet they leave the trench to form squares despite the fact that the trench would have been much safer you could watch this movie and  really know absolutely nothing about the life or campaigns of napoleon utter rubbish
Dec 9 2023,negative,hard to fit 30 years of argueably one of the most influential figures in history into a 3 hour film the best parts of the film were the ones that were included in the trailers battle of waterloo was underwhelming and the ending was laughable
Dec 9 2023,negative,basic biography movie about napolean with some impressive battle scenes
Dec 9 2023,neutral,visually its classic scott storywise its classic meh historical accuracy is sacrificed for reasons unknown certainly not for flow or insight into the napoleon psych overall its too long for too little
Dec 9 2023,negative,no continuation in the storyline the movie should be called josephine
Dec 9 2023,positive,we werent bored and it was a pleasant experience but neither the acting nor content rose to academy award levels
Dec 9 2023,negative,the casting was very odd joaquin could have been a good choice but he acted like a child vanessa kirby was a very strange character and didnt complement him at all all their scenes together had an off feeling  as if she would rather be anywhere else than with him  rather than being humorous those scenes just felt stupid especially the sex scenes   the war scenes were well done but somehow just didnt work the characters didnt seem to be affected by the war at all at the end of the day there was no reason to care about them
Dec 9 2023,negative,pointless biopic  long and boring  a completely inaccessible psychotic protagonist with zero redeeming qualities prompts the question  why was this film even made  one good reason perhaps discovered by my partner who reclined back in the plush cinema chairs sleeping while i contemplated waking her for an early exit
Dec 9 2023,positive,acting was good but story line vague
Dec 9 2023,negative,very very very very slow hated the casting of napoleon with a strong american accent terrible terrible music score no action to speak of hated the colour filters wanted to walk out midway but thought it just kust improvebut it didnt amongst the worst movies ive ever seen at a cinema possibly the worst such a great story yet such a failure of a movie imo
Dec 9 2023,negative,yes the visuals are stunning  and decors blend perfectly with the well known paintings that depict the events following the life of napoleon the film is effective in transporting you visually to the splendor and horror of the era but fails to deliver the story in a digestable manner that maintains the historical accuracy it deserves yes history buffs will remark that mr phoenix certainly does not reflect the age of a courting bonaparte and the pyramids were never hit by french shots  but even without that scrutiny the film feels like a cinema version of a drivethrough a fastfood history scott is a far cry from bondarchuk     however monumental the cinema and decors this film grants you the pace at which the movie flies through time takes away from the monumental feats that are depicted mind you not only those of the emperor himself but everyone around him  from his lover to his generals his soldiers his people and his opponents and on top of that often our attention gets diverted by slapstick comedy that brings seems to serve little purpose other than entertainment  which is not countered by any of the gravitas we might expect the scriptwriter might not have been hampered by reading tolstoy    napoleon is a film that can be lauded and scolded at the same time  and always will be as controversial as the time and person it portrays some might rever him as the man who brought the modern age to europe with a code that is a foundation to many european countries where trafalgar square and beef wellington are national treasure some might see him as a warmonger that was defeated and preluded imperial greatness of their own country it is thus no small feat to complete the work that kubrick did not get to but scotts featuer lenght film leaves much to be desired     maybe a directors cut will change that
Dec 9 2023,negative,terrible awful boring whenever vanessa kirby was offscreen my brother in law thought that he might need to see it to see what misinformation his students would see i told him i was so confused in the aimless wasteland of corpses that i doubt anyone would remember what they had seen
Dec 9 2023,positive,to use a metaphor the movie napoleon is ridley scotts waterloo and well beyond joaquin phoenix depth
Dec 9 2023,positive,it was interesting thought provoking at the least and inspired me to refresh my knowledge of that period of history it felt extremely disjointed at times i think i would have preferred a more character driven story the battle scenes were very well done i think it is worth the watch at least once but maybe not more than that
Dec 9 2023,negative,it was long winded and boring im surprised joaquin phoenix  managed to carry it as long as he did ma does not get enough credit the scrip was horrible dont watch it
Dec 9 2023,negative,i find it really hard to take seriously seeing napoleon bonaparte with an american accent the battle scenes were okay otherwise i found the movie quite boring to watch
Dec 9 2023,positive,it was not as good as i anticipated especially being a ridley scott spectacular movie  the battle scenes were great but the acting of phoenix seemed subdued at times and his voice seemed not to project out into the audience  overall i give the movie a b minus
Dec 9 2023,negative,i honestly believe that only people who know everything about napoleon or absolutely nothing about him might enjoy this film myself i knew enough about him to be excited to see this film and i really wanted to learn morebut was quite disappointed napoleon for better and for worse rocked the western hemisphere to its core and yet you get no sense of why he did what he did you get even less of a sense of why it mattered i have no idea what story ridley scott was trying to tell with this movie
Dec 9 2023,positive,saw napoleon last night with the wife  we both liked it  i was surprised my wife liked it as much as she did  she especially liked the relationship between napoleon and josephine  i loved the cinematography  the progression and development of napoleon  the movie just wasnt long enough which could have had more detail  the topic of napoleon is massive and complex  i highly recommend seeing this film  i believe it is an instant classic
Dec 9 2023,positive,epic proportions movie seems to sag repeatedly dulled the interest
Dec 9 2023,negative,terrible acting terrible scenario old rich people making movies avoid
Dec 9 2023,negative,lacking in so many aspects no story line no character development no memorable scenes lines or visuals  everything is rushed although its nearly a 3hr movie no sense of the impact to history no insights to the character or what made him tick his love for josephine is the only intriguing part of the movie and even that lacks the hook   there isnt even a plot with a climax for those expecting anything remotely close to gladiator this will be severely disappointing
Dec 9 2023,neutral,producers want us back in the theatres but mr scott did nothing to push that with this rather boring movie whats cool well the scenery costumes actingbut the script is a plodding wetfooted semigood piece and its 40 minutes too long
Dec 9 2023,neutral,napoleons life was a rollercoaster of emotions this film wasnt if the intend was to make an english burlesque movie 55
Dec 9 2023,negative,theater couldnt get the movie to start never saw it
Dec 9 2023,positive,great historical accounti loved the relationship of napolean and josephine
Dec 9 2023,positive,this is a magnificent movie in every way but one i dont think joaquin phoenix was right for the part good actor but too old to play the young napoleon and since napoleon is so well known his appearance matters
Dec 9 2023,positive,i really loved the atmosphere of it i never saw myself wanting to gaze off and not pay attention because normally i would and i just really love the french revolution 
Dec 9 2023,positive,hard to follow all over the place tried to fit too much into to little time good action scenes in war fights
Dec 9 2023,negative,sex scenes were completely unnecessary and inappropriate they ruined the film
Dec 9 2023,negative,1 part historyish 9 parts navigating a french marriage should have been titled napoleon and his wife
Dec 9 2023,positive,great historical movie
Dec 9 2023,negative,walked out after 90 minutes
Dec 9 2023,negative,what a travesty to make this movie only to go out of their way to portray him horribly
Dec 9 2023,negative,it was one of the worst movies i have ever seen  joaquin phoenix was absolutely terrible and completely unbelievably in the role  do not waste any money going to see this movie
Dec 9 2023,positive,it was a very good movie i really dont understand why it got such bad rotten tomato ratings this is why i dont pay attention to these ratings i will say that someone would have to have a knowledge of historical napoleon in order to get the movie completely
Dec 9 2023,negative,if a lesson in the history of battles napoleon took part in is what you after the movie is fine  as far as a look into who and why napoleon was the movie is a waste of time and money      i could have fallen asleep on the couch watching mad max
Dec 9 2023,negative,the least thing that i want to know about napoleons destructive relationship life
Dec 8 2023,positive,its a masterpiece of course ridley scott cannot fail me
Dec 8 2023,negative,a farce reduced napoleon to mcgriber 
Dec 8 2023,positive,i specifically went to this movie to learn some history and since it was from ridley scott im assuming it was pretty accurate  i enjoyed it though sometimes it was difficult to keep track of which character was which especially in the beginning before the overthrow by napolean et al
Dec 8 2023,positive,relatable visuallystunning telling of the story of napoleon
Dec 8 2023,negative,summary you like history strategy military tactics history epos napoleon maybe ridley scott movies then stay away from this one  its a historical telenovela that should be called josephine    wow i heard its bad  but this bad i mean how can you make a telenovela out of that  how can you spend more time on the divorce of napoleon than on all battle scenes literally describing zero of his military reforms standardization of military equipment supply chain improvement any tactical choices nothing but i know now that it seems he liked to fuck like a bunny in doggystyle  jesus christ  25 hours that i will never get back 0 stars    good scting by the way  just extremely bad storywriting
Dec 8 2023,positive,i enjoyed the character build up but do wish they had dived deeper into napoleons early years
Dec 8 2023,positive,good movie i enjoyed the story line
Dec 8 2023,negative,i was so looking forward to this movie  while the cinematography was good the entire direction of the movie was horrid  i know i could have written a better script geeze
Dec 8 2023,positive,this movie is art àudio 100000000010 visual20000910 and all the other things 100000000010
Dec 8 2023,negative,so boring i should have walked out after the first hour like another couple did it was painful to get to the ending of this one
Dec 8 2023,neutral,the wonderful acting great directing and awesome war scenes arent enough to overcome weak story telling i left the theater wanting to now much more about napoleon the movie glossed over too much of his life despite having a lengthy run time
Dec 8 2023,positive,the acting was sublime
Dec 8 2023,negative,napoleon the failure omg mumbling stumbling bumbling mess  both phoenixs acting and scotts directing  gratuitous gore and gratuitous  overacting turn off the goofy dialogue forget the camp acting and maybe you can still enjoy the expensive cinematography should be released as a silent film
Dec 8 2023,positive,loved it  i am a history afficienado and thought that it was well done  it was actually too short at 2   hours because the napoleonic period was so intense and impactful
Dec 8 2023,positive,battles are great everything else is meh but it keeps the film going
Dec 8 2023,positive,there is nothing we can do
Dec 8 2023,negative,long disjointed poor dialog poor portrayal of key players and not funny where humor was intended wasted money and time
Dec 8 2023,positive,an interesting approach of the bizarre rise and fall of napoleon bonaparte this ridley scott epic is certainly filled with brutal action fantastic cinematography and slightly awkward sensual interactions joaquin phoenix and vanessa kirbys performances are nothing short of spectacular and their chemistry on screen is undeniable while suffering from an extended run time and a lack of understanding inside the mind of our central character napoleon is most definitely incredibly written beautifully shot and very well acted dont pass this one up
Dec 8 2023,negative,its a crime that this bafoon of a director is allowed to besmirch our most famous historical characters hopefully someone will stop him when he tries nelson   what he did to alexander was bad enough but this is so crass it takes it to w whole new level staggeringly dreadful on every single level and no saving grace whatsoever
Dec 8 2023,positive,this is one of those films that will stand the test of time it harkens back to the golden age of film when the major studios were investing in films that were spectacular with casts of thousands the beauty of this film will overwhelm you the cast the costumes the sets and most of all the battle scenes are truly astounding a stirring film that does not insult the audience this is oscar material
Dec 8 2023,positive,i really loved this movie what are people expecting it was great acting great story line  kept me awake the whole time  i truly recommend it 
Dec 8 2023,neutral,napoleon is a confusing film well joaquin phoenix and vanessa kirby delivers and the set pieces cinematography and sound were good but the story lacks of something to be told the narrative is too confusing for me they tried to tell so much with too much runtime yet still cant told properly i dont know where they wanted to focus on
Dec 8 2023,neutral,the film has good production value with costumes and sets looking great but the plot of the film is not worth the length the mood of the film is all over the place a better ridley scott and joaquin phoenix film is gladiator 2000
Dec 8 2023,positive,we watched on superscreen and i was totally immersed throughout which is rare not knowing much about the bonaparts before the film it was educational and heartbreaking at the same time visually it was shot beautifully and the special effects were seamless joaquin phoenix was funny mad sad and bad i left with mixed feelings about napolean the man  as this film covered so many angles  reading some of the historians critiques it appears the film is not an exact reflection but i went to be entertained and i left satiated
Dec 8 2023,negative,awkward odd and incomplete  was so looking forward to thisand equally disappointed with the result  story had major holes acting was soso and generally just failed to meet the mark  what a shame  should have been brilliant
Dec 8 2023,negative,this nonsense is unworthy of the man who created the masterpiece the duellists
Dec 8 2023,positive,perhaps im too ignorant to find fault in the facts i came out feeling depressed but for good reason so many people died five tears from me 
Dec 8 2023,positive,dont really get what all de negativity is about i liked it good cinema movie
Dec 8 2023,positive,not bad but you will expect more with ridley scott at the helm the story is all well and good but i wonder if they really had to make him out to be a bit of a buffoon either way it was a decent film but youve seen better films in this genre
Dec 8 2023,positive,ridley scott done it again 
Dec 8 2023,positive,action historyvery enjoyablefast moving
Dec 8 2023,negative,meh not good very boring
Dec 8 2023,negative,its laughable the produces including ridley scott could even pass this as close to historical reality it rivals or even surpasses the historical rewriting of the queen cleopatra series i have no idea how such an experienced movie creator like him would go ahead with attempting to compress napoleons life into a one movie  adding to that the subpar acting and cgi expected of the movie of this level id say its the biggest big production let down of 2023
Dec 8 2023,positive,wierd  soundtrack with strange singing overemphasis on josephine not ridleys best by a long shot
Dec 8 2023,positive,a little drawn out   didnt say what age he was when he died and cause of death
Dec 8 2023,positive,fantastic repro of historical events  battles sieges revolution etc     i did not like  skipping over years of eventful happenings like jumping from russian debacle to 1st abdication  portrayal of nappy as actually fighting in front lines in battles  so incorrect  i believe the movie distorted napoleons  personality and karisma  also distorted his relationship with josephine de beauharnais    true history is so much more interesting
Dec 8 2023,negative,very slow and boring waste of money
Dec 7 2023,negative,i was disappointed i hoped for a good movie 
Dec 7 2023,negative,the audience and critics are right on this one just not that good phoenix was interesting but just had no sparkle kind of joyless and colorless movie battle scenes were well executed and the josephine love story was interesting and could have been the movie but just kind of all over the place without a real narrative glue
Dec 7 2023,negative,boring slow doubt too much on his love affair with josephine and not enough on his battles and what he accomplished it was slow the photography was always foggy i cant believe every battle he fought was in fog it just was not for me in fact i left with about 20 minutes left i dont do that very often
Dec 7 2023,negative,this movie was such a disappointment it had all the opportunity to be a great epic movie great costumes great picture and potential for awesome battle scenes and portrayal of an interesting historical character ok i can understand when directors take artistic freedom to make something entertaining but it wasnt even entertaining the movie was so flat and had no coherent point or theme and then why did mr scott have to ruin battle of austerlitz with complete historical inaccuracies like the non existing ice covered lake it add nothing of value to the story the battle scene would have been more epic if it was connected to some sort of historical accuracy now it just made the whole thing silly and i could just facepalm myself and feel ashamed on behalf of mr scott and mr phoenix then the nonchalant way they have responded to critics about the historical accuracy they should have listened and learned something but no they have just been completely ignorant these ignorant guys should be ashamed of themselves and this terrible movie its a joke that didnt need to end up as a joke it could have been great they just tried hard to make something superficially entertaining but in the end they even failed with that
Dec 7 2023,negative,if the same effort was put into the writing  and casting as the costumes and sets it might have been a hit
Dec 7 2023,negative,was really looking forward to seeing this one  aside from all the historical inaccuracies it was a complete slap in the face to who napoleon was and what he accomplished  there was a lot of nonsense thrown in that had no reason to be there  the length of the slow paced movie didnt help either as some humor was injected into the theater when another poor soul who paid for this torture had fallen asleep and was snoring through the second half of the movie  i feel like i was robbed wouldnt even reccomend watching it when it comes out on streaming platforms
Dec 7 2023,negative,this movie sucks ass both the writer and director shouldnt be near a webcam let alone a 200 million dollar film budget i could not make this film more boring if my life depended on it geriatric ridley should be wheeled to the closest retirement home asap
Dec 7 2023,positive,the movie was good about filling me in about nepoleons life his rise and fall and rise and fall again his love for his wife josephine her inability to provider him with an heir the battle scenes were very graphic and about as real as you imagine they must have been  at the end of the movie they listed the battles that had been fought during his rein  and the number of casualties  was staggering over 3 million 
Dec 7 2023,positive,i thought it was a good popcorn movie
Dec 7 2023,negative,epic battles but lacked storyline of interest
Dec 7 2023,negative,it was disappointing 
Dec 7 2023,positive,it was a bit slow in the beginning but i didnt like the parts where the horses were killed especially napoleons horse it kept my interest
Dec 7 2023,positive,this movie didnt glorify napoleon making him a tough and weird man and i liked that its well produced but i wish i had more knowledge about frances history to verify if its accurate or not
Dec 7 2023,neutral,jp seemed to just phone it in  cinematically it was amazing but i can name 5 actors that would have put more energy into this role
Dec 7 2023,negative,the more i think about the film and other reviews of it it seems as though it was intended to be some sort of parody it doesnt even work as that
Dec 7 2023,positive,it was a pretty good movie i wouldnt say it as powerful as some of ridleys other films i think the film flows really well
Dec 7 2023,negative,the movie lacks a central theme it is a sequence of individual scenes with numerous time jumps in between the love affair with josephine dominates the movie but seems forced by the zeitgeist for the same reason ridley scott lets a person with color serve in the french army of the 19th century as a high ranking officer a visually stunning movie that nevertheless seems boring and restless
Dec 7 2023,positive,advanced civilized society does not want to admit that looks count for more than anything else in romantic visceral primal love even to a man as great as napoleon 
Dec 7 2023,neutral,it was ok but not great  slow story  napoleon and other characters were not well developed
Dec 7 2023,positive,excellent movie totally recommended
Dec 7 2023,negative,horrible  one of historys greatest figures and they botch the whole thing  from joachim phoenixs portrayal of napoleon to the whole storyline it was all pathetic  it doesnt seem theres any director in this age who can do a phenomenal film on any of the great figures of history  just a big disappointment
Dec 7 2023,positive,terrific acting and action are all over this film but napolean struggles to handle the weight of its source material  history is often hard to portray but glossing over facts of the past makes this film weak in multiple areas  the epic scale is there but the depth is lacking when it is needed to flesh out the grandiose visuals
Dec 7 2023,neutral,to sum up this movie in one word disappointing napoleon spent way to much time on the love story and should of spent more on the war aspect of napoleon ln short its a shame because there where so many opportunities to make this a great movie but instead we got a mediocre one
Dec 7 2023,positive,amazing film both a great character film and a great war film dont listen to the haters
Dec 7 2023,negative,very very disappointing  the dialogue was mumbled and the battles jumped from one place to another with no explanation  it was just another blood and guts movie with no story and poor acting
Dec 7 2023,positive,i thought it was really well shot costumes sets the scale of the battles were awesome i thought joaquin was amazing  to me it was about a brilliant general who had great leadership in battle but in every other aspect of his life he was ineffective all his flaws would eventually lead to the ruin of him his family and the country that he loved
Dec 7 2023,positive,very good historical account of napoleons life movie was big and sweeping but did not live up to the hype maybe i expected more but i still enjoyed it and will recommend to my friends
Dec 7 2023,positive,as it stands it goes to show the scope of the mans life is too large for a movie it feels like a medley of best bits that feels rushed a series would have worked better shame because ive been waiting for this for a very long time     maybe the directors full length will give more weight to it
Dec 7 2023,positive,the acting was pretty decent but it was so dim  dark i get why it was filmed that way but it wasnt dark all by of the time also it was a bit too long  liberties taken with the story were not necessary in my opinion
Dec 7 2023,positive,good kind of slow at times but then picks up to some intense battles scenes
Dec 6 2023,negative,it had some memorable battle sequences and some of those were interesting to watch it otherwise really didnt capture much about who napoleon was or his importance in history i like joaquin phoenix however his version of napoleon is not credible to me and seems to mostly reflect familiar elements of his previous characters
Dec 6 2023,positive,the movie tried to tell too much in too short a timeframe it should have focused more on a single event of napoleons life or just not jumped around so much the fulllength directors cut will likely be much better than the theater movie much like kingdom of heaven
Dec 6 2023,neutral,it was a greatly produced film where cinematography and visual artistry reigned the image references to the historical paintings were magnificent and truly impactful leaving you with the feeling of inhabiting and voyaging through the many familiar paintings of the french revolution and the napoleonic wars unfortunately this is where my praise finds its end the legendary love story between napoleon and josephine was in this film tragically one dimensional and lacking of any poetic depth i believe the film missed out on a massive and vital opportunity of telling us a love story that we could feel instead the writing did not travel beyond the confines of clichés the story had no heart beat and past a few moments of glory the film became boring and felt too long
Dec 6 2023,positive,ok i saw most of this on a youtube history video  still interesting somewhat off putting with the sex stuff could have done without seeing that
Dec 6 2023,negative,i was expected another great and wonderful film of ridley scott but when i go out of the cinema i was terrible disappointed with the final result
Dec 6 2023,negative,one of the worst movies ive seen in a while i got asleep in the first half and i could not watch it until the end because i was too bored i left the cinema and didnt even watch the end nonsense
Dec 6 2023,negative,it reduces napoleon to a uncharismatic weird character and doesnt really include much of the extraordinary military knowledge and influence of france and europe that he had
Dec 6 2023,negative,skip the theater this movie is best enjoyed at home with a good book  most of the movies best moments were included in the trailer    as a war movie there were far too few battle scenes  the few battle scenes it did have were short lived and more artful than anything  i kept waiting for something exciting to happen and it never did  each of the few battles teases action and excitement but inevitably falls short leaving you dissipointed and frustrated    as a romance it is as disappointing as napoleons love making apparently was if only it had been over as swiftly  neither character is particularly likeable making it difficult to become emotionally invested in the pair or their fate be it together or apart  the choice to incorporate the piano score from pride and prejudice every time theyre together was strange at best since it didnt fit the scenes and just managed to make them even more uncomfortable to watch  even as a biopic the film fails horribly  before watching i had always considered napoleon a potentially interesting historical figure  in the movie napoleon comes off as unapologetically whiny and dull  the portrayal of his character feels like ordering  a 20 chicken caesar salad and being slowly force fed a single limp undressed leaf of romain lettuce over the course of two and a half hours  for two and a half hours it swallows the lettuce or else it walks to the theater restroom just to feel alive again because dear god this movie is so long and so boring please make it stop
Dec 6 2023,positive,it was a good history lesson  the battles were epic but a little slow in between
Dec 6 2023,positive,movie used poetic license to overlook certain factual details however more details of accuracy were present and the embellishments enhanced the movie experience and didnt get in the way of telling history      thought it was a great movie and caught a lot of amazing glimpses and imagery of the times of napoleon and the amazing feats that happened during reign loved it
Dec 6 2023,positive,im hoping for the directors cut when released on bluray  i was hoping for a little bit more background on napoleon before marie antoinettes beheading but overall it stayed true to whats been written about him  
Dec 6 2023,negative,so i was with one of my friends because of the napoleon memes the memes lied to me in general the film was good but it had to many scenes with r18 wich ruined everything and made him look like a goofball and a creep also the russian emperor guy didnt kiss napoleon which was a rip off
Dec 6 2023,negative,starts off great then completely falls apart after the first 30 mins battle scenes only go so far the story of napoleon was not told well at all very disjointed i was hoping this would be an epic movielike gladiator etc nope 3 hours of my life that i will never get back 
Dec 6 2023,negative,this is not an epic movie i cant remember the last time i was that bored watching a movie
Dec 6 2023,positive,well done lots of bloody battle scenes
Dec 6 2023,negative,a film without a clear horizon
Dec 6 2023,positive,the problem with historical epics is that if you are trying to cover a whole life or era then its difficult to establish a proper plotline  this film falls into that trap which for someone like ridley scott is surprising  the film is a hugely expensive saga of lavish pomp and ceremony scenes followed by vast battle scenes followed by explicit bonking scenes but no real story  the only element of suspense in it is whether bonaparte can get josephine pregnant or not  this coupled with a rather wooden performance from phoenix makes ultimately for a somewhat tedious assault on the senses
Dec 6 2023,positive,photography and direction are gorgeous but the portrayal of napoleon as an opportunistic antihero a failed and somewhat trivial figure highlighting and perhaps exaggerating his negative aspects it is not the most accurate representation of a man who contributed to history in many other ways
Dec 6 2023,positive,too long slow at times
Dec 6 2023,positive,actually it had all the potential to become good movie but i think the plot and the music failed to make impression
Dec 6 2023,negative,very disappointed with this movie completely passionless and boring
Dec 6 2023,positive,phenomenal movie go see it
Dec 6 2023,neutral,not one of scotts better films it would have been nice for the actors to at least try to have a french accent i did learn a few things about napoleon from watching this is film 1 josephine could not have children when she married napoleon and because of this the marriage was annulled 2 napoleon had a son by another woman 3 josephine was not faithful to napoleon one of the things everyone knows about napoleon is his diminuitive size but it was not covered in this film in fact he looked about as tall as every other man in this film acting wasnt bad but i just felt the script could have been better
Dec 6 2023,positive,the film has the right amount of action and epicness the music is perfect i like this version by ridley scott on the great french leader
Dec 6 2023,neutral,lets start by saying that i dont understand the choice of such a consistently dark photograph apart from that the technical sector and the precision in the historical reconstruction are commendable making the battles the part that best entertains the viewer the portrait of napoleon as a man is confused and at times grotesque sometimes generating embarrassing and outofcontext comedy good acting performance for phoenix and kirby unfortunately they and the battles are not enough to keep the attention span high for 2 and a half hours
Dec 6 2023,neutral,the historic inaccuracies were staggering such as napoleon leading the charge at waterloo and wellington never met napoleon at all shown in film on the ship whilst the battle scenes were relatively spectacular they were just a hotchpoch of infantry cavalry and artillery all thrown in the mix without telling any real story of the battles     agree joaquim was miscast and film spent far too long on naps obsession with josephine
Dec 6 2023,positive,excellent depiction of epic history
Dec 6 2023,positive,excellent movie lots of action and romance i have no idea why there are so many critics i would certainly watch again 
Dec 6 2023,positive,i really enjoyed napoleon the movie kept me interested and captivated throughout im not sure why its getting so many mixed reviews but i thought it was great
Dec 6 2023,positive,the acting was phenomenal however there was a lack of direction in the movie the storyline was unexpected
Dec 6 2023,neutral,great actorspoor acting napoleon was uncharismatic socially awkward and difficult to watch when not fighting not enough fighting to make this movie interesting there are more books written about napoleon than any other person in history and this is the best story we could come up withif you really have to see it rent itdont watch it with your kids though horrible sex scenesno wonder josephine cheated on him if that is idea of making love
Dec 6 2023,positive,one of ridley scotts better period pieces that isnt gladiator napoleon boasts strong performances from joaquin phoenix and vanessa kirby decentlystaged battles good pacing and some okay emotional moments sadly lacking chemistry between the titular character and his beloved josephine a characterisation that suggests that sir scott is treating his subject with contempt and of course monsieur bonaparte being a bit too complex for a single selfcontained film to do him justice amusing how in this age of franchise fatigue finally taking its toll on audiences this was the one time when people actually wanted it to be either a twoparter or a trilogy dont make this film as highly recommendable to be as fellow 2023 epicscale biopic oppenheimer and those issues are without taking the films historical inaccuracies and french audiences dim views into account
Dec 6 2023,positive,i wish it went into more detail with the battles but for 25 hours thats probably not realistic  awesome movie all around
Dec 6 2023,positive,i fear living in a world in which this has bad reviews and the marvels is considered great filmmaking
Dec 6 2023,neutral,i love joaquin phoenix and napolean is most definitely one of the greatest military commanders of all time however the issue lies with its many historical inaccuracies i wish the film had focused more on his rise to glory and how smart of a person he was strategically rather than touching the surface on timeline events and his relationship with joséphine it all just felt too rushed for such a much more intriguing person
Dec 6 2023,positive,my wife was pretty smart and she knew  the events so she liked it and she knows a lot of the events
Dec 6 2023,positive,this was a spectacular movie  it did not drag it was a masterful slow burn  it was not hard to follow the people places and periods made perfect sense  and it certainly packed a punch the highs and the lows the magnificent and mundane all blended perfectly together  and the dichotomy between tyranny of the masses and normal tyranny was also well rendered
Dec 6 2023,positive,there was no character developmentscott should stick to aliens
Dec 6 2023,positive,amazing cinematography artistry  and presentation a 1950s and 60s style blockbuster
Dec 6 2023,positive,the sound was bad for much of the movie or actors were not speaking clearly as i could not hear half of the dialog  dont think the actors were that good in it either  didnt evoke much emotion to me  only mediocre  wait for it on tv
Dec 6 2023,negative,this movie is just not what you would have expected going in  and thats fine  but the direction they took it in was awful  lol  nothing cool about napolean honestly  im not sure what i think of him movie did nothing to show who he was at all im just confused  lol
Dec 6 2023,negative,marketed as an intense military movie but it was a drawn out love story    incredibly boring regret seeing this one in theaters
Dec 6 2023,positive,it really wasnt really that bad not a brilliant epic in the vein of the fifties ben hur or kirk douglas spartacus but entertaining nonetheless this is really not a tale you can tell in 2 and a half hours and scott missed the mark by not doing enough to make the audience identity with the protagonist pheonix did a reasonable job of acting the role and a love story was attempted but the audience needed more which brings me to what the film missed most it needed to touch on the romanticizing of napoleon as the bringer of liberty and the disillusion felt by some enlightened folks when he crowned himself emperor that would have been an important piece to the story as the revolution in france was seen as an opportunity for the common man and woman to rise above their station telling that story might have endeared us more to the main character instead we are shown a crazy egoist obsessing over a poutyface brunette i liked the costumes cinematography and scenery but the story needed to developed and told a little more
Dec 6 2023,negative,no redeeming qualities in this moving  it was not entertaining informative exciting or fun at all  very disjointed scenes which jumped around and were difficult to connect i was expecting something much more
Dec 6 2023,positive,a really well made movie portraying such a notable historical figure while avoiding looking like a dry documentary joaquin phoenix once again hit a home run as one of the superstar actors of recent memory the only negative for me was the sound mix of the movie because the dialogue in the many closeup scenes of napoleon and josephine was not clear and distinct
Dec 6 2023,positive,this was a great movie finally showing some real life the only thing about it was they showed only one aspect of the man it was more a love story than his military prowess at the end of the movie that just showed how many people died in his wars not how many war he actually won 
Dec 6 2023,positive,after learning about napoleon then seeing the movie it made watching this movie very enjoyable joaquin phoenix did a phenomenal job portraying napoleon
Dec 6 2023,positive,one of the best movies ever made fuck josephine however
Dec 5 2023,negative,what a wasted opportunity to bring to life one of the most interesting influential infamous and diabolical figures in european history  there was little to no reference as to how napoleon actually rose to power in a river of blood and far too much emphasis on the dysfunctional and coabusive relationship with his first wife
Dec 5 2023,positive,some good scenes but it skips over far too many important events
Dec 5 2023,negative,the movie was disappointing i thought there would be more of his military career and less about josephine
Dec 5 2023,negative,ridley scott film in name napoleon film in name french film in name yet no name can save it ridley scott remains to be a name that has employed several great names we now see that the names we dont know are more important than the ones we do know namely ridleys scotts napoleon bonaparte represents a fictional france  vive la france
Dec 5 2023,positive,great battle scenes amazing historic architecture and a pure pleasure to watch on the screen definitely recommend
Dec 5 2023,negative,i gave it one star for the setscgi   the rest is a just a run through of a long timeline with little connection between the jumps  was hard to follow and boring despite its potential
Dec 5 2023,positive,great movie enjoyed it a lot
Dec 5 2023,negative,i think perhaps i should have had a phd in the french revolution to follow the movie the gratuitous sex scenes were totally not necessary i watched this with my son awkard this could have been a great movie
Dec 5 2023,positive,very informative great effects
Dec 5 2023,negative,not much insight beyond what is generally known  battle scenes seemed overdone and much of the time between them was very slow paced
Dec 5 2023,positive,i have never read anything about the historical figure of napoleon but i know that he was a criminal that criminal who carried out conquests that made people forget that he was a criminali find it very funny that people criticizing it wanted a romanticized and glorified napoleon but this pathetic side of him presented in the film makes me see him as more human i dont mind with the real napoleon and i learned to sympathize with this feat by joaquim
Dec 5 2023,negative,toulon was a reasonable action scene and austerlitz was brilliant but no one going to see a movie about napoleon wants to see a 60minute detour about him desperate to produce an heir and they especially dont want it flooded with more depressing blue than the drowned soldiers in austerlitz the movie flops besides a handful of well delivered line
Dec 5 2023,positive,learned a lot and the acting was great
Dec 5 2023,positive,a visual experiencebeautiful cinematography  well acted well designed great story  thoroughly enjoyed the movie
Dec 5 2023,negative,about as boring as a movie can get
Dec 5 2023,neutral,the movie felt stretched too thin to find its footing not enough military context to be a war movie not enough of a convincing relationship  to be a romance not enough solid acting to be a drama things simply happen with little motivation as if checking off bullet points from a rather dry history text
Dec 5 2023,negative,this film was an absolute hit piece and a disgrace to one of historys greatest generals it like if we made a movie about caesar but only about his lost battles infidelity and assassination its a shame thar joaquin phoenix was cast for this role hes a phenomenal actor but just doesnt fit here such a shame
Dec 5 2023,positive,i wanted to love this movie phoenix is a truly gifted actor and ridley scotts movies rarely miss but sadly this movie fell short of being recommendationworthy the bifurcated story doesnt do justice to either the sex scenes were unappealing and added nothing to the story what most wanted to see was the battles which fell short of accuracy or of relaying the true history i also would want more of the backstory how does a corsican rise to emperor i wonder what they cut
Dec 5 2023,neutral,it was interesting but its really a character study of napoleon and his relationship  with josephine which sometimes led to strange jumps in the narrative  seemed like the only reason to show him in egypt was an excuse to have napoleon rush back to france in a jealous rage if you didnt know much about napoleon  the hundred years war duke of wellington etc its easy to get lost wonderful costumes some of the battlefield scenes are  confusing grey screen made so many of the scenes made it difficult to know which army was which  overall it might  have helped if ridley had spent more time in the cutting room to achieve the pace his films normally have
Dec 5 2023,negative,disappointing it just seemed like the director bit off more than he could put on screen in two and a half hours in the end it comes across like the film is briefly skipping from one event to another without context or continuity you know that a historical drama is not working when the only memorable parts of the movie are the sex scenes
Dec 5 2023,negative,scott missed the mark here avoid this movie if you enjoy history or spectacle watch it when it gets released on apple tv     the plot loosely follows chronological order but takes large erratic jumps that skip over a great deal of context the movie deviates from history in many important ways with many of the inventions of the movie being obviously made up adding a cartoonish quality to the characters of the film that felt accidental the movie jumps from one period to the next following various arcs that never seem to come together the movie spends altogether too much time on the sexual awkwardness between napoleon and josephine while also making neither character particularly compelling in this dynamic similarly depictions of napoleon as ruler feel incoherent and understated not really discussing any strategy or philosophy beyond one or two sentences thrown in to advance the plot    while i knew going into the movie that the writing was overly imaginative the greatest  disappointment was the visuals of the film most of the shots of large groups of people were painfully lazy cgi including the battles columns of troops looked like they were hovering over the battlefield overhead shots of crowds just looked off many pans and other camera movements had inexplicable frame rate drops and motion blur ruining wide panoramic views because all of the detail was lost in the jostle and distortion it seemed like the vfx budget was spent on the few gratuitously gorey moments in the film such as the opening scene of marie antoinette being beheaded with the executioner holding her severed and bloody head in a closeup shot napoleons horse being shot in the torso by a cannon and the subsequent scene of napoleon fishing the cannonball out of the body and robespierres failed suicide attempt the detail of the cgi for the bloodied entrails of the horse or the hole in robespierres face was way higher than any other visual effect used which was especially annoying because none of these events really served as a main plot point     added a full star because the set design and costuming was good
Dec 5 2023,negative,this gray dull movie is essentially a hit piece on napoleon none of his motivations are clear his romance with josephine is seen as a one sided obsession and hes portrayed as a psychopathic petulant man baby who at his core is almost cowardly none of his military genius is explored very little is understood regarding his romance and love for josephine his barren empress despite a huge amount of screen time is given to the couple and he becomes emperor because reasons rather were treated to a series of events in chronological fashion that were somehow supposed to piece together but theres no sense of struggle no bonding with any of the characters in this surprisingly bloodless yet bloody movie and no sense of growth in any of the characters things happen because things happened but the worst aspect for me was the color palette everything is shot in a washed out grayish tone with little contrast or richness which sets a perfect backdrop for this boring soulless movie oh we do get a body count for some of the major battles too and including napoleons disastrous russian campaign but its not clear if those were total losses or just grand armee ones and who cares these were not conscripts but willing participants but why they were willing to follow nappy is entirely unclear because in this movie he has zero charisma napoleon almost succeeded in uniting europe under one banner and was simply better at fighting than others of his ilk including wellington to whom he eventually lost at waterloo but why did people follow him this movie doesnt treat him as a hero or conqueror or even a respectable villain but as a callous petulant man baby who did what he did because thats what he did but then what did i expect from a bloody brit director
Dec 5 2023,positive,half this movie is quite enjoyable the other half is spent on a sordid romance and ahistorical activity like bombing the pyramids a black officer in napoleons inner circle who never says a word and other foolishness so much amazing history in napoleon and the movie wastes half its allotted time
Dec 5 2023,negative,boring pointtheme unclear waste of good actors
Dec 5 2023,positive,expectations were high and the movie did not meet my expectations i am into history and the movie was a load of rubbish from a historical point of view this should be considered a work of fiction so a more appropriate title was josephine and napoleon  because that was the main subject of the movie i was entertained despite the length of the movie so that is why gets a passed
Dec 5 2023,positive,a well made movie with extraordinary actors and some accurate historic facts    what i loved some historic facts of great importance were greatly portrayed fall of the monarchy end of terror era fragments of egyptprussian and russian campaing the coronation and politic ascension    what the movie missed some of the legal and politic reforms that would lead the world to the modern era and historic battles napoleonic civil code politic reform nile navy battle italian campaign    what i disliked but my wife loved too many scenes with joséphine a historic figure that should have her own movie but not half of the napoleon movie
Dec 5 2023,negative,one of the worst movies ive seen in a while  really im not kidding  this movie was so bad after the first half i stayed in the theater just to make fun of it with my friends tbh we were doing that also in the first half
Dec 5 2023,positive,fantastic epic joaquin has never been better ridley fits as much as he can into the 2 hours and 38 minutes impressive see it on the big screen
Dec 5 2023,negative,kinda boring might be a movie for someone who likes battlewar scenes
Dec 5 2023,positive,it had so much potential but was a swing and a miss so many key historical facts about napoleon were left out
Dec 5 2023,positive,some cool fight scenes but largely dull and unnecessarily long
Dec 5 2023,negative,boringcould not watch the whole thing  story was not interesting and i am a history  what a huge wast of time
Dec 5 2023,positive,one should not come into this film with the expectation of constant montages of battle keeping you engaged on a sensory level  this is an artful although somewhat dramatized capture of napoleons life and reign as one of the greatest generals this world has ever seen  it capsulizes his vulnerabilities to the love of his life josephine and his faults as a human in tandem with his overwhelming superiority as a military leader  this movie was very well done although some may lack the ability to appreciate its work by coming to view the movie with unreasonable exoectations
Dec 5 2023,positive,great movie absolutely great a masterpiece
Dec 5 2023,negative,an historical massacre
Dec 5 2023,negative,have you ever watched a 3hr movie without connecting to a single character i have now absolutely terrible the potential was there but completely missed i cant imagine sitting through the uncut 5hr version if youre reading this youve been warned
Dec 5 2023,positive,good movie keeps your attention  recall your history classes
Dec 5 2023,neutral,the most average possible move you can watch
Dec 5 2023,positive,very brutal playing out 78 of his major battles  men and horses  over 3 million men killed in all his battles       acting was good
Dec 5 2023,positive,i very much enjoyed this movie but felt it could have been 2 movies  i would have loved to see a bit more at his personal development in exile  i feel the first movie could have ended with him finding out about his exile and then the second movie picking up at that process  it felt long the way it was done and i had to reengage for post exile but never really caught back into the movie
Dec 5 2023,negative,worst movie i have seen in a very long time  i thought the story line was bad  the dialogue was really bad  the napolean character was horrible and not believable  so so so bad  but the josephine actress was good  i give this movie a lower rating than appears above
Dec 5 2023,positive,underwhelming heavy focus on the love story for the magnitude of the mans impact on the world this movie utterly fails to deliver that magnitude 
Dec 5 2023,negative,this movie is about a terrible subject matter to make into a movie no matter how long it is  even overlooking that this was a bit of a stinker    the movie starts off in what was really the start of the french revolution where they are beheading marie antoinette  they give no context to the uneducated viewer about what is going on and considering that this was made in the us where we have a limited education about history in general it really missed the mark on getting the majority of the audience to understand anything  they gave a short paragraph about the history and not much else    given napoleons history of 81 battles spanned over 11 wars the fact that they only showed 3 battles and vaguely eluded to a few others was a shame    beyond that it appears that they tried to make the story of napoleon a love story about napoleon and josephine where josephine was a part of nearly every scene whether she was there or not  i found it ridiculous    i give the cinematography and the costumes high marks but thats not enough to make this movie worth paying for
Dec 5 2023,negative,napoleon had to have been one of the most charismatic leaders i history to lead his nation on the many campaigns of conquest this movie did little to capture the charisma that he had
Dec 5 2023,negative,last hour was the whole movieup to that time dragged and meaningless dialog did not emphasize the military brilliance he had and made fun of his supposed awkwardness socially and with josephine i strongly doubt that such a charismatic and inspiring figure would have such awkwardness
Dec 5 2023,positive,well made movie  a little slow in some parts  perfect movie to see on the big screen
Dec 5 2023,positive,great soundtrack and vibes but the constant change of scenes made me confused and does not link them together
Dec 4 2023,positive,stunning visuals make up for a somewhat shallow narrative the audience is moved from chapter to chapter through napoleons life without ever spending much time to reflect on who he is or why he did what he did for a man who wrote so much about his own life youd think that wouldve come through more but they seemed overly concerned with trying to fit in every key military moment so count me as surprised that the various wars and battles were difficult to keep track of sure there were a lot of shifting alliances but there needs to be something in the exposition to help the audience keep track also phoenixs performance didnt help it seemed he didnt know how he wanted to play it very inconsistent and overall kinda flat vanessa kirby however was excellent
Dec 4 2023,negative,there is 0 pacing you feel every single minute of this movie it feels like a war montage there are people places and events that are of no significance to the audience we dont even know if the movie wants us to like or dislike napoleon it looks nice and the music is good but thats it
Dec 4 2023,positive,great movie it really a must see was not expecting it to be so good was captivated from the beginning to the end great from start to finish if you are not into these kind of movies dont see it but if you are you must see it
Dec 4 2023,positive,i read the review really loved the story romance and battle
Dec 4 2023,positive,the cinematography and production value is above any hollywood movie napoleons life story is too complex for just 3 hours it would need a two seasons series at least and it has no antagonist character
Dec 4 2023,neutral,i was really looking forward to this im a big ridley scott fan but i thought this was a hard watch    i felt the story was hard to follow napoleon as the main protagonist came across as a bit of a weirdo and it was too long    the biggest issue i had is that they kept referring to the british army as english while using the union jack there is no such thing as the english army its british which is made up of english welsh scottish and most likely irish soldiers at that time they died and defended their country in these wars and should be recognised under the british flag ridley scott should know this being born in the uk and apple who produced the film should know this as they have many customers in scotland wales and ireland    one thing i wont be doing is watch the 4 hour version coming to apple
Dec 4 2023,negative,totally underwhelmed never gets going and delivered from an odd perspective cant believe ridley scott put his name to this  even battle scenes are poor avoid 
Dec 4 2023,positive,great movie well directed
Dec 4 2023,positive,acting story visuals
Dec 4 2023,neutral,focused on nothing interesting about napoleon made him look like an incredibly weak and bumbling character phoenix is a great actor and he wasnt in this the spectacle of the battles were the best part  nothing held the prominent events worth knowing together though  josephine was used as glue to hold together a story that just wasnt interesting at all and felt forced
Dec 4 2023,negative,i am surprised this was not better  i kept waiting for this movie to get better and it just didnt with the directors and the actors i thought this movie would be a lot better i have to say im disappointed
Dec 4 2023,negative,so so bad not even the rumoured 4 hour cut could save that turkey the battle scenes are so bad they are irredeemable when the british sniper shot a hole in his hat at waterloo i laughed out loud gotta love those scoped baker rifles  crafty move by wellington to dig trenches for his infantry and put stakes in front who knew  as the credits rolled i turned to my partner and said thank god its over
Dec 4 2023,negative,disappointing this napoleon doesnt feel neither great nore charismatic the time line isnt fluid and doesnt make sense i never saw napoleon in joaquim phoenix all along the movie  its not a good historical movie but its not a good fiction either
Dec 4 2023,negative,slow boring snoozefest one of the worst movies of 2023
Dec 4 2023,positive,do not expect a documentary it is not a movie about the napoleonic wars instead its a fascinating character study thats why its named after the man rather than the wars he waged napoleon ascends through the ranks due to his inclination towards control much of it is shown through his bizarre relationship with his wife which provides symmetry and foreshadowing there is no grand ending napoleon never changes or learns anything he keeps doing what he does as long as he possibly can until he gets old and dies then it ends and you are left to wonder at why it even happened there is no glory in war
Dec 4 2023,negative,a wasted opportunity to tell the story a great historic figure there was no real story going basicly a sad attempt to make something great
Dec 4 2023,negative,wrong movie name its supposed to be named josephine if youre here to see the worlds greatest military commandergeneral in history with a 95 battles won ratio you will be greatly disappointed almost as if the directors had a personal dislike of napoleon for some reason
Dec 4 2023,negative,needlessly long movie i was often confused over which side was which during the conflicts some of the flashback scenes were not obvious and left us very confused over what was happening sex scenes werent horrible but really werent necessary to convey the directors message overall we saw it but not something i was very impressed with
Dec 4 2023,negative,boring actually first movie i left before it ended really sad because i wanted to like it so much as historyperiod movies are my favorite
Dec 4 2023,positive,great photography visually excellent  joaquin played a good role i would have liked more detail about the man and less war scenes
Dec 4 2023,negative,the film is disappointing i dont care if its not 100 historical but having a script is good too  here weve just got a series of scenes sometimes unconnected  the film ticks off all the clichés of the period about the character
Dec 4 2023,negative,battle scenes were mostly poorly done and were very piecemeal for the battle portrayed timeline of napoleons career was disjointed and skipped large periods of time relationship with josephine was poorly and overly done and i quickly tired of watching joaquin smirking mumbling and shuffling his way through this movie save your money i wish i had
Dec 4 2023,negative,big sweeping scenes in an otherwise poorly told story  dont waste your money going to see it in a theater just wait for it to come on a streaming service you already pay for
Dec 4 2023,negative,napoleon described talleyrand as a shit in silk stockings i believe this movie doesnt get a better description than that good picture and music good acting from the only two characters that actually talk in the movie in more than 2 scenes ridley already showed us that he lost his touch with the last alien movies now we know he also lost it for historical movies anything else in the movie is just not worth mentioning how can you turn one of the most interesting characters in history arguably the one with more history written about since jesus one of the most impressive militar strategic in history in such an interesting historical context all just unexplained and taken over by a love history that focuses on british gossip more than historical facts
Dec 4 2023,positive,great acting great cenario but that was kind of just it 248 hours that could actually be only 130 without losing anything relevant the movie tells the story very well but it brings a lot of long unecessary takes that make the movie too long without trapping the attention or entusiasm
Dec 4 2023,positive,great acting cinemetography and a fresh take on napoleons rise and ultimate fall  its both an action packed movie and a love story which chronicles napoleons obsessive fixation with his wife jodsephine both joaquin phoenix and vanessa kirby deserve oscar nominations
Dec 4 2023,positive,i watched this movie with my husband yesterday  i liked it in general despite its not a historical lesson it gives you motivation to read and discover more about napoleon and his life the movie is much better than many others we have watched in the cinema for the last few years
Dec 4 2023,positive,learned about famous battles enjoyed the focus on napoleans relationship with his wife josephine
Dec 4 2023,negative,too much focus on his love life    story is messy and difficult to follow even with prior knowledge key events
Dec 4 2023,negative,overall it was an okay movie  while the visuals were fantastic and the cinematography top notch the actual content was far less intriguing  i expected to see the grandiose achievements of napolean and explore his relations with the people of france his commanding generals and the powers of europe over which he triumphed time and time again  instead a large focus is placed on his rather mundane relationship with his first wife and mostly brief and either dull or oversimplified renditions of a few of his battles  in effect none of what made napoleon the man as memorable as he is was really explored within the confines of what was shown in cinemas nor are the overall social nor military contributions to history reflected in any way
Dec 4 2023,negative,terrible script awful storytelling no vision whatsoever whoever thinks this was subversive needs to educate their expectations i had at least expected some great images incredibly boring movie
Dec 4 2023,positive,the movie was fantastic you wont be disappointed full of action great characters actors unbelievable soundsystem a must on your list
Dec 4 2023,positive,this was a very good movie not great due to its uneven story telling the edit and even cinematography left the best story out of the movie  very compelling characters and great story but poor execution imo i would still highly suggest this though because it succeeds at humanizing napoleon and josephine and it was a great love story as well just felt like it was trying to do too much and yet not enough
Dec 4 2023,negative,should have been called josephine a miserable waste of two and a bit hours
Dec 4 2023,positive,i never understood napoleon until i watched this marvelous movie i watched several stories about him but nothing in comparison with this movie the drama suspense marvelous costumes and the breathtaking venues and architecture of the 17th to 18th century
Dec 4 2023,negative,poorly filmed and boring
Dec 4 2023,negative,the movie focuses way too much on napoleons relationship with josephine and treats napoleon as just a man who was at the right place at the right time which he wasnt the movie skipped over major points in napoleons life such as italy and the movie only showed a few battles which did look spectacular and amazing sadly the movie is not very accurate such as napoleon shooting the pyramids and has apparent flaws such as napoleons marshals names never being said or them being introduced    i think that a better name for this movie would have been napoleon and josephine  tldr good battles  not historical  too much focus on relationship
Dec 4 2023,positive,hilarious and exciting
Dec 4 2023,positive,napoleon    director ridley scott brings it fullon with imagery and action aplenty in this epic regarding the tiny egomaniac who wanted to rule over practically everyone    while the imagery with perfect set decoration production design costumes and cinematography is amazing the films nontechnical ingredients are good but not great    the story is always interesting it gives us a bit of his military political and romantic life how much is fact and how much fiction is the question then again who the hell would know in the first place all superstars in our world of history become onedimensional mythological figures over time a lie told many times becomes the truth right     joaquin phoenix is fine delving in to the mans human side however he uses a contemporary sounding americanstyle voice throughout which is offputting its like someone from 2023 stepped into the 1700s in europe just to play a role waitthat is what he is doing i didnt like his performance at times but didnt hate it either it felt like it was out of place    the weakest link however comes from the young dude playing the leader of russia talk about contemporary he looked like a thin model from an online site selling clothing his acting was sorry to say not good     the movie gains strength with the multidimensional performance from vanessa kirby as josephine she delivers the best and most believable performance in the film     ridley scott gets all of the technical aspects right the rest is merely ok
Dec 4 2023,positive,lots of action and bits of history fun fun
Dec 4 2023,positive,wanted to see more action wished that they had added more battles that he fought missed opportunity 
Dec 4 2023,positive,absolutely captivating true ridley scott attention to detail and joaquin phoenix was spectacular battle scenes were so realistically filmed i truly felt right in the middle
Dec 4 2023,positive,thought it was great
Dec 4 2023,positive,the storyline is about napoleon when you see movies not precious on the actual account but  what we think of what happened but not 100  but it made us feel on how powerful he was and what was like to live in 1700 and 1800
Dec 4 2023,positive,acting  was fantastic story was good to short
Dec 4 2023,negative,slightly below average movie but for a supposed blockbuster it was a bust
Dec 4 2023,negative,too dark and too many battle scenes
Dec 4 2023,positive,the insides scenes were way to dark  the volume was way too loud  i wouldnt recomend it
Dec 4 2023,negative,it was oki guess if you havent read the story behind napoleon you will have an misunderstanding balance
Dec 4 2023,positive,interesting actors often mumbled little character development   chaotic battle scenes unable to deciipher
Dec 4 2023,positive,it was solid there were some funny parts partly due to phoenixs delivery of them it didnt seem like 25 hours long it wasnt overly gory and it made me wonder why we didnt cover the napoleonic wars in hs
Dec 4 2023,negative,awful movie everything interesting about napoleon was ignored for some reason they decided to just make up a bunch of stuff why literally a disgrace to history this movie should be banned and the director shunned for eternity this movie is historical about as much as harry potter which by the way is a much better movie     and for gods sake why does every american movie set in another country have to have everyone with a british accent except the main character who has an american accent like this is the french were talking about why not give them french accents its so cringey
Dec 4 2023,negative,just enjoyed watching joaquin but was surprisingly disappointed with ridleys poor direction script and no flow in the movie
Dec 4 2023,positive,interesting movie that paints a portrait of a man greatly responsible for the lives of 3 million soldiers deaths in the name of the country he loved and his ego
Dec 4 2023,positive,i thought it was very entertaining and phoenix did a fine job as did all the other actors  i enjoy history and liked seeing things played out i left feeling i had seen something very worthwhile so tired of superhero movies etc  this was a movie with substance  go see it  the tabloid news focuses on the box office dropoff  big deal  dont let that dissuade you from seeing a fine movie
Dec 4 2023,positive,thoroughly enjoyed the film  well acted
Dec 4 2023,negative,extremely slow moving movie the soundtrack was bizarre and we couldnt wait to leave the cinemography was stunning but the script just drug on 
Dec 4 2023,positive,great storytelling and spectacular battle scenes hard to feel any empathy for napoleon or josephinej
Dec 4 2023,negative,this movie was lackluster circled around but never landed the dialogue was awful
Dec 4 2023,negative,slow boring and devoid of any excitement how can you make a boring napoleon movie save yourself of 25 hours of agony
Dec 4 2023,positive,wonderful and historic
Dec 4 2023,positive,a little slow in parts and a history lesson in terms of chronology  that said a fulllength movie could be made on each of the battles and each milestone becoming the emperor selfcoronation the divorceetc  good show though excellent acting
Dec 3 2023,positive,dont go if you want wars this is more about his personality weaknesses and deep love for josephine some viewers felt the acting was poor phoenix intentionally expressed napoleons odd characteristics my husband and i enjoyed the movie
Dec 3 2023,neutral,i really wanted to love this movie the cinematography was breathtaking the acting was meh and the writing was bleh phoenix just didnt seem on point like he was in gladiator it should have either been a josephine movie or a napolean movie they tried to make it both and it ended up being far too long in runtime and disjointed
Dec 3 2023,positive,weak script uneven acting battle cinematography was good
Dec 3 2023,positive,they left out some important wars and battles and put more focus on his private life nice to see the romance with vanessa kirby play out but i kinda came for epic war battles 
Dec 3 2023,negative,one of the worst movies i have seen ridiculous performances and directing people actually giggled at it 
Dec 3 2023,negative,i dont think that napoleon had a yankee accent and spoke so quietly often couldnt be heard over the background music    that and the obvious errors from historical fact made this film entirely missable    after all the critics hype i wish we hadnt wasted two and a half hours watching this    rest of the mainly british cast were great    phoenix was miscast
Dec 3 2023,negative,battle scenes to long while other historical issues compressed and consequently hard to follow film color to dark bleak
Dec 3 2023,negative,ive never been so let down by a movie in my life the closes thing that has happened in recent years that even compares to this is cyberpunk 2077 but they were able to redeem them self with updates over time there is nothing that can be done to save this terrible film
Dec 3 2023,positive,napoleons story in history is so fascinating and theres a lot worth making a movie about the film covers a lot of it but its point of view seems scattered across a few different possibilities is the point that jospehine mattered most is it that napoleon got a lot of people killed is it that he was adored by france     pieces of his story that didnt make the final cut could have pushed the film in any one of those directions instead i left wondering so what
Dec 3 2023,positive,ok so it wasnt historically accurate regardless joaquin phoenix has proven that he is an excellent choice to cast as a villain he has played the villain in gladiator hes won the academy award for his role as the joker in 2019 and now he has proven that he is the greatest acting choice to play napoleon it was a bit longer than it should of been but ridley scott deserves an academy award nomination for best director and joaquin phoenix for best actor
Dec 3 2023,negative,no passion no theme no point to make not worth watching or having made
Dec 3 2023,positive,a bit flat no surprise no vision it goes through the motions far too much about josephine too little about greatness or drama i truly regret that kubrick didnt see it through
Dec 3 2023,positive,the story and acting were amazing and the battle scenes were spectacular i loved it
Dec 3 2023,negative,i would have gotten more joy out of burning the money i spent on this movie than actually watching the movie rotten rating is being too nice to this movie
Dec 3 2023,positive,i liked the movie and filled in some things about napoleon i didnt know
Dec 3 2023,positive,absolutely amazing movie acting and photography are perfect really good historic animations the story well developed
Dec 3 2023,positive,is was extremely refreshing to see a historical piece that was true to the characters that didnt have any bullst virtual signalling
Dec 3 2023,negative,almost walked out 40 minutes in movie is just awful horrible acting horrible story avoid at all costs
Dec 3 2023,negative,very weird movie   cinematography battle scenes were amazing but did not enjoy the rest  left early 
Dec 3 2023,positive,almost everything about this movie was absolutely phenomenal until its weak slow and ultimately boring script hardly made me care about anything
Dec 3 2023,positive,i found it very entertaining the beginning is gruesome 
Dec 3 2023,positive,my biggest concern was the focus on his love life i think i speak for many history buffs when i say that we arent going to a napoleon film to learn about his romances if you didnt know the history behind france you could barely piece together that he was an artillery gunner who innovated in that type of warfare and changed battlefield strategy when a film tries to do a little of everything it fails to do anything well
Dec 3 2023,positive,this is 100 great historical movie if you are a history buff you will enjoy this very much 
Dec 3 2023,negative,feels like the scenes repeat themselves war scene then a letter to his wife scene then a reason to leave war to return to his wife boring overall
Dec 3 2023,positive,a lot of history in this movie joaquin phoenix is great would watch this movie again nothing to dislike about this movie thank you again
Dec 3 2023,negative,disjointed narrative substandard script and zero chemistry between two iconic characters napoleon and josephine
Dec 3 2023,positive,joaquin phoenix was a good fit for the title role the movie was good but not great no special magic thought it odd that both the french and the english characters had english accents with the exception of joaquin phoenix who had an american accent very watchable and not boring but somewhat disappointing
Dec 3 2023,positive,a whistlestop tour through french history that never really got to the heart of the matter or the character
Dec 3 2023,negative,you never get a sense of just how great a military commander napoleon was and so when it comes to him loseing the battle of waterloo it doesnt seem like that much of a downfall the movie was much more focused on his love affair rather then him as a military commander not what i was hoping for
Dec 3 2023,negative,a millennial view of a historical period
Dec 3 2023,negative,incoherent story with historical liberties  but most importantly boring and uneven  most characters are irrelevant to the plot and only serve to say bad dialogues
Dec 3 2023,negative,slow and skipping lots of important parts like his invasion of italy and spain lack of the charisma that he had so few os his marshalls appear and so few battles
Dec 3 2023,positive,they portrayed napoleon as a bafoon which didnt suit well with me
Dec 3 2023,negative,excessive violence poor character development unlikeable charcters no historical context 
Dec 3 2023,positive,good drama with spectacular battle scene but terrible on historical accuracy
Dec 3 2023,positive,not getting all the hate entertaining historical enough good overall
Dec 3 2023,positive,joquin phoenix was very good it made me want to learn more about the history of napolean
Dec 3 2023,negative,went into this movie with high hopes  between ridley scott and joaquin phoenix i figured it would be a winning combination  it wasnt joaquin delivered a flat  awkward performance you could tell he was making it up as he went along  kudos to vanessa kirby for keeping her composure during her scenes with joaquin and his bafoonery after the 4th awkward and unnecessary sex scene  i committed to walk out if there was a 5th thankfully there wasnt ridley portrayed naploeons obsession with josephine in such a way that it felt like a filler to eat up time the battles were few and much of the cannon and rifle fire was so clearly cg it detracted from the overall feel i feel this movie was a truly lost opportunity what a shame
Dec 3 2023,negative,boring and long too much dialogue not enough fighting
Dec 3 2023,negative,an excruciating watch  i was tempted to walk out during the first hour
Dec 3 2023,negative,chaotic farcical and few battle scenes looks like a b movie non sensical and just plain disgraceful representation of one of the most hard charging man to ever live
Dec 3 2023,positive,super good fighting scenes good love scenes good dramatic scenes good the ending was good napoleon is the goat
Dec 3 2023,neutral,the movie tells us that this happened then this happened then this happened     why well its a little less clear on that part     devastatingly napoleon appears in his uniform early in the film and is unchanged as a character from there it is impossible to feel his charisma or popularity amongst the populace the man is old and dull and stays that way from his young life to final exile there are no stakes when he is sent to exile or loses at waterloo because we have no idea who the character is france is there somewhere in the background doing god knows what     we do know he likes josephine that seems to be the point of the movie but yet again their whole relationship is either sitting at opposite ends of a sofa or a bit of rumpy pumpy their status and view of each other might as well be us reading newspaper headlines in fact sometimes it is    i was looking forward to a character somewhat hidden from the angloverse having a renaissance and a reemergence into the popular imagination at the hands of a talented actor and a talented director     sadly this hasnt happened and any dumb effect based action pleasure is somewhat muted too given that no particular campaign is followed with tensions and resolutions but everything is crammed in and skipped through while sharing the intricacies or deeper story of none of it     i felt cheated of the great movie it could or perhaps should have been
Dec 3 2023,negative,its very average i was so excited to watch this and i wanted to like it but i didnt this movie missed a lot its basically michael scott leading a military
Dec 3 2023,neutral,fell asleep 3 times 
Dec 3 2023,positive,great set designs great cinematography some good war action and well acted especially from joaquin phoenix but since the tone of the movie is dark and bleak throughout the whole  movie it doesnt make that enjoyable and it is kinda boring especially since the movie is two and a half hours long so its a good movie overall but its not rewatchable for me
Dec 3 2023,negative,an uneven movie i had high expectations which unfortunately were not met that does not mean that i thought it was a bad film it is beautiful to look at and vanessa kirby was excellent i am a big fan of joaquin phoenix but feel he was miscast i do not feel the complexity of napoleon was demonstrated on screen and i am unsure with this is due to phoenixs performance or scotts direction i hope the four hour edition will provide a more fulfilling experience
Dec 3 2023,negative,so so boring and painfully average a reused soundtrack no interesting plotline it just felt lazy in terms of writing and dialogue
Dec 3 2023,positive,the battle sequences looked great but napoleons character his rise to power and his relationship to josephine were not explored enough and the different aspects and events were not connected in a meaningful way which made the movie feel like it had nothing interesting to say
Dec 3 2023,positive,napoleon on the autism spectrumbelievable but hard to convey  josephine convinces us of her magnetism but her attitude toward him is hard to figure out  wellington is supercilious and cold but oddly empathetic toward him  psychological signalling against brutal inventive almost beautiful battlesan army plunges bloody into a frozen lake napoleons horse is blown apart by a cannonball moscow is abandoned and set afire by the fleeing populace      maybe this one is a thinker that will grow in reputation over time  the three hours werent painful just strangely lacking punch focus and climax  if that was intentional maybe it will take a while to appreciate the style
Dec 3 2023,negative,boring started googling when napoleon died to see how much longer the movie had to go thought about leaving early
Dec 3 2023,negative,so disappointing the movie has good cinematography by a terrible story the movies has terrible passing and doesnt know what it wants to tell the movie is an insulte to historical movie genre its like thirdly didnt even try to make the movie historical napoleon has no charisma  none his brillance is shown this movie suck dont pay for to watch it
Dec 3 2023,positive,ehh its ok  beautiful to look at and welldirected but it felt hollow  just kind of empty somehow
Dec 3 2023,positive,i liked the overall a third person story into his character and his life
Dec 3 2023,neutral,70 of the movie revolves around josephine relationship with napoleon is too long a movie for such a topic i was expecting something more exciting for my mind like the conference 2022 all movie happens in just one conference room and is way better than napoleon just because of dialogues
Dec 3 2023,negative,disappointing choppy narrative unnecessary cut scenes acting was good but characterizations were flat napoleon is depicted as a bumbling oaf fixated on josephine completely disregarding his military prowess
Dec 3 2023,negative,very slow moving movie very disappointed
Dec 3 2023,negative,there is an overabundance of resources about the life and history of napoleon but it feels like ridley scott read just the covers
Dec 3 2023,positive,the battles on the big screen are amazing  interesting and sometimes awkward characters works sometimes sometimes not
Dec 3 2023,positive,loved the whole movie joaquin did an awesome job as well as josephine 
Dec 3 2023,positive,amazing cinematography really good story considering good action
Dec 3 2023,neutral,it was like watching the previously on recaps of a 10 part miniseries in napoleon fun battle scenes expository dialogue scenes are napworthy at times dialogue was odd at times no french accents but they had a couple lines of german in the film with not even a single line of french weird 
Dec 3 2023,positive,i cant believe people are giving this a bad rating it was actually pretty good with a good plot and several well executed battles depicting a reasonably realistic version of the napoleonic wars the acting was top tier but there was a bunch of more boring bits dispersed around in the beginning overall well done
Dec 3 2023,negative,i thought i would give it a chance the reviews were bad the live war action was well done that is where it ended the movie became a hurricane with no beginning or end whoever edited this film spliced it and let it fall on the floor i have walked out on one movie in my life now there are two save your money i hope this movie is not the reason for my 4 monthly increase for apple tv streaming
Dec 3 2023,negative,worst movie waste of time
Dec 3 2023,positive,could have been better and longer
Dec 3 2023,negative,unfortunately it felt like a rushed history lesson
Dec 3 2023,negative,the costumes were really the only positive highlight of napoleon i think ridley just bit off more than he could chew napoleon isnt a story you can tell well in 2 hours and the bits he chose to tell it was disjointed my wife and i left the movie thinking what story was he even trying to tell about napoleon  from a historical perspective it really may as well have been written by george iii in his later senile years no less im not one to complain about minor details but you cant end the movie with napoleon running away by himself as his soldiers get killed at waterloo there are myriad other historical issues but one is left thinking if that is how napoleon was why did anyone follow him and that dissonance is the overriding error of the film good guy bad guy thats almost irrelevant the man was loved by a nation and inspired those around him and this film portrayed none of that
Dec 3 2023,positive,i loved it it was entertaining for a long movie like this i thought the battle scenes were not over done  joaquins acting was great and breathtaking cinematography one must understand that this is a biopic and its difficult  to show every details of napoleons life in 160 minutes and it is not a war movie  overall decent  incomparable to ridleys epic gladiator
Dec 3 2023,positive,great acting and action  i wish i had known more about napoleon before seeing the moving
Dec 3 2023,neutral,not very focused on a certain storyline characters werent well explained unless you did a 7th grade on napoleon
Dec 3 2023,positive,an historical epic with superb acting  by joaquin pheonix and impressive battle scenes this must have been a difficult movie to make to compress the life of napolean bonaparte into 2 and half hours however ridley scott pulled it off i dont rate the film as highly as gladiator as it seemed to lack that little bit of pazzazz that is required to excite and enthrall viewers the film had 2 central themes the love life of napolean and josephine and the conquest and ultimate failures of bonaparte  these were intertwined well enough and in the end left me satisfied and entertained but not enough to rate it 5 stars nevertheless this is not a bad movie and belongs in the pantheon of historical epics
Dec 3 2023,positive,good movie more of a history channel documentary than anything else
Dec 3 2023,positive,i bought the tickets before reading the reviews  reviews were pretty bad and i regretted agreeing to see the movie  im glad i went  it was very well acted and had great cinematography  it told a fascinating story that had me coming home and googling more about napoleon and josephine  there was quite a lot of violence and gore but likely reflected the true nature of battles in those days
Dec 3 2023,positive,i cant believe that anyone gave this a poor review i just came back from the theater phoenix and kirby were outstanding sometimes we cant go by reviews this is one of those times
Dec 3 2023,positive,the movie was a bit long and somewhat slow in parts but overall a very good film  the cinematography was spectacular and the battle scenes were breath taking  i think mr scott tried to fit his lifetime into a 2  hour movie and it seemed a bit crammed  there were a lot of characters that came in and out of the film and it was difficult keeping track of them and their role in the movie  it would have been helpful if i had a degree in french history
Dec 3 2023,negative,horrible dialogue that was badly delivered slow pacing boring except for battle scenes waste of my time and money
Dec 3 2023,negative,despite the massive media attention and notable director the film didnt come close to portraying the real napoleon his exploits or the global drama during his adult lifetime cinematography was phenomenal the story and the story telling was mediocre at best
Dec 3 2023,positive,there is a great movie in there somewhere i felt like it was cobbled together not edited properly
Dec 3 2023,positive,very long but enjoyable if u like historical movies great actors costumes  scenery incredible
Dec 3 2023,positive,this movie biopic was great joaquin phoenix vanessa kirby and the rest of the cast did a great job in this movie this true story about the legendary french leader napoleon bonaparte was dramatic interesting and tragic it really shows the viewers what his life was like and what it took to be the leader of france if you havent seen this movie yet youll probably like i didnt enjoy it as much as i wanted to but it wasnt terrible
Dec 3 2023,negative,lame onesided slander fest legendary military genius and statesman portrayed as narcist douche bag
Dec 3 2023,positive,beautiful cinematography and battle scenes but the acting and story line is just dull
Dec 3 2023,positive,it was good actually it was great for a movie telling a story back in real old days it give you that feel of oh you wanna win the war but i give it a rating 1010
Dec 3 2023,negative,great acting but very poor writing
Dec 3 2023,negative,good costumes and use of real people instead of overreliance on cgi  poor dialogue romantic chemistry and inconsistent portrayal of napoleon  rushed pacing through 40 years with little to no context  napoleon was one of the worlds greatest leaders in this movie he is portrayed as an awkward man with little to no charisma or self confidence
Dec 3 2023,positive,i was enthralled from the moment it began
Dec 3 2023,positive,great movie joaquin phoenix is just a must see with anything hes in this one doesnt disappoint
Dec 3 2023,positive,napoleon is the kind of amazing biopic spectacle that one can truly appreciate from ridley scott amazing attention to detail battle scenes and tactics leave the kids at home i really recommend you see this one not sure where the dislikes are coming from
Dec 3 2023,positive,little long  but battle sequences and acting well worth it 
Dec 3 2023,positive,great movie about an important world leader 2hr 36 minutes run time went efficiently  this is a great theater too
Dec 3 2023,negative,if they had focused on historical accuracy instead of making a softcore porno it would have been a good movie too bad
Dec 3 2023,neutral,this goes down as my most disappointing film of 2023 ive been waiting for this since earlier in the year and i sadly have been met by a lot of disappointments clunky script terrible pacing overtly long and drags weird tone changes and sadly a very meh performance from joaquin phoenix when compared to his other recent films beau is afraid cmon cmon joker the action sequences and vanessa kirby save this film but isnt enough had no idea id somewhat enjoy house of gucci over this props to ridley for dedicating this to his dog though that was nice
Dec 3 2023,neutral,i didnt enjoy this movie even with the action not gladiatorblade runner tier
Dec 3 2023,positive,it was a good movie enjoyed it
Dec 3 2023,negative,no stars at all undoubtedly one of the 3 worst movies i have ever seen and i am 70 years old    nothing to do with napoleon just sad always gray no dialogue no character buildup almost every historical detail wrong except for the dates needlessly violent unbelievably bad
Dec 3 2023,negative,snooze fest boring story boring characters the actors were asleep mediocre cinematography mediocre direction
Dec 3 2023,negative,this was the worst movie i have ever seen
Dec 2 2023,positive,i dont understand the low scores  movie flew by enjoyed all scenes joaquin was wonderful  visually appealing  filled in a balance of the character and historical context  one could appreciate russia invasion and waterloo without background knowledge  overall glad i saw it in theater
Dec 2 2023,positive,plenty of flesh and plenty of flash    napoleon is a piece of shit that sometimes serves as manure upon which some flowers grow among them are makeup artist jana carboni who gives the main actors striking resemblances with napoléon and joséphine phoenixs thoughtful performance and kirbys elegant one and the spectacular albeit disturbing battle cinematography    disturbing because through the war images which make up most of the film there is a sense of beauty that seems to embrace killing some shots repeatedly insist on blood flowing into water the result of wounded or dead soldiers drawn in rivers as savage as this is supposed to be the waterblood blending looks like a series of peaceful abstract paintings are we witnessing napoléons point of view there his love of war      it is too unclear to tell as is scotts  point of view that seems to navigate between showing respect for one of the greatest military geniuses in history and ridiculing him he shows a napoleon with no manners something his corsican mama wouldnt have allowed he shows someone whose idea of sex is mounting women like horses and with a speed equaling twothumb typing on a mobile phone to attract napoléon joséphine spreads her legs as she sits on a chair and shows him her vagina she is taller than he is in the movie yet she was five foot four and he was five foot six slightly above average at the time and the equivalent of todays six foot    but he was called a small man in his time by european monarchs who could not accept that someone coming from nowhere the small island of corsica not born into royal blood could rise to their level make no mistake he was a tyrant  who betrayed the french revolution but so were they     yet during his reign fashion freed women from corsets and they were able to breathe instead of fainting regularly and being given salts to regain consciousness     and it is thanks to napoléon and his code civil that france has a stable republic     this is not mentioned in the film granted one must make a selection when one decides to portray a complex and huge historical personage but scott could have shortened his numerous battle scenes in this poorly edited work    to be frank when i left the theater i felt i had been entertained but annoyed as well by the occasional spoof that was out of place it didnt diminish the image of the french emperor instead it cheapened the movie and had not joaquin phoenix and vanessa kirby given it class it would have been a flop    otherwise there is plenty of flesh plenty of flash and little more
Dec 2 2023,negative,although the premise of bringing a critical view of napoleon due to his bloodthirsty legacy seems interesting at first the director effectively loses credibility by creating a poorly connected historical novel that reduces important and complex historical characters and events to the pathetic and ridiculous
Dec 2 2023,positive,its messy but not a total loss either vanessa kirby is outstanding as josephine and the battlescenes are riveting but joaquin phoenix is an oddity as napoleon and some of the whimsical humor and experimental improvisation by its lead may be its biggest downfalls along with a half hour to an hour that feels missing from the overall near 3 hour haul
Dec 2 2023,negative,it wasnt great in any aspect and surprisingly the whole room stayed for the film in its totality definitely not a great watch not only from the historical viewpoint but also in the cinematographic  no attaching character the scenes follow each other without any transitions  i was truly disappointed about this movie
Dec 2 2023,positive,being ignorant of french history i found this movie fascinating  it felt a bit choppy at times but for a long movie i thoroughly enjoyed it
Dec 2 2023,negative,cinema graphics and costuming were good  acting fair odd scenes that appear as outtakes eg when napoleon lost his hat a couple times there were ice cubes in what appeared to be lemonade  on a table in tent in egypt  hole in napoleons hat at waterloo was pretty goofy and fairly symmetrical and not realistic relationship with josephine was confusing phoenix mannerisms as character seemed odd overall it passed my time
Dec 2 2023,negative,the mediocre dialogue really turned me off
Dec 2 2023,neutral,no story no real characters amazing cinematography and score
Dec 2 2023,negative,its long thats ok with me     but it takes ages to get going     not enough action can i have my 3 hours back pls 
Dec 2 2023,negative,joaquin was a bit strange and not in his normal good way  long and boring movie more character development needed and fewer battles
Dec 2 2023,positive,very graphic  loved the history  interesting portrayal of napolean
Dec 2 2023,negative,it was a disappointment  the person napoleon had very little color and there was no story theme the waterloo battle scene was a spectacle but doesnt save the movie i cant recommend it
Dec 2 2023,negative,this movie is awful from the unlikable characters and the clear misunderstanding of napoleon bonaparte to the historical inaccuracies of this film its sad that the sets costumes and budget was spent on a disappointment to history buffs and the and poor people who wasted their money to watch this in theaters
Dec 2 2023,negative,worst film ever read the reviews before but war scenes were often from a distance and story line was weak would have gone to sleep as was far too long should have stopped about hour before end
Dec 2 2023,positive,just a big old fashioned historical epic with incredibly staged battles that should be enjoyed on the big screen the biggest mistake probably was the casting of joaquin phoenix although hes a good actor were so used to see him play weird characters and his mannerisms just become too much of a distraction wouldve been better to cast a lesser known actor who can actually disappear into the role that said  this is still great ridley scott material
Dec 2 2023,neutral,a giant missed opportunity  the movie tried to juggle too many balls in the air without strongly focusing on any of them  the acting was good enough although phoenix wasnt as sharp as i hoped and the few military scenes held my attention  outside of them the movie just kinda dragged along as a middling pace until the end  it wasnt terrible rather it was a mild letdown
Dec 2 2023,positive,a little to long but well done
Dec 2 2023,negative,i found the movie to be strange but i wouldnt say it was necessarily bad i thought the scenery was excellent  the acting ok but i found some of the dialogue to be odd along with the fact that the movie was too long i dont think i would go out of my mind at to recommend it
Dec 2 2023,positive,it really was a great film    good vibes
Dec 2 2023,neutral,halftone impression i still dont understand certain choices but the film is watchable and highly entertaining all the same its a very fine piece of filmmaking
Dec 2 2023,negative,thoroughly disappointing scrapped battles in favour of nonsensical exposition with a poor understanding of the battles themselves
Dec 2 2023,positive,a great ridley scott film through and through it demands some level of attention due to the complexities of a film about napoleon its easy to accuse the film of historical inaccuracies and claim that it doesnt give adequate attention to other important aspects of his character however given the gargantuan task at hand the director succeeded at making the balancing act work shedding equal light on his emotional life blazing military career and the narcissistic and toix nature of his character given the complex material i think this film is a triumph of the period epic genre
Dec 2 2023,negative,apart from its name this movie has nothing to do with the actual napoleon
Dec 2 2023,negative,it was boring for those who dont know the historical significance of each and every one of napoleons battles he was a military genius of his time but other than that the film fell flat   it also attempted to showcase his personal life in which youre supposed to sympathize with the character but here no such thing was done it was hard to root for anyone in the film when the character development was not there   there was also not really a plot and napoleon wasnt working toward anything in particular so there was no pay off in watching this they really couldve done this way better but it felt like a boring history lesson
Dec 2 2023,negative,boring movie  war scene diserved money but only that
Dec 2 2023,negative,so much potential in the story wasted on romantic side of napoleon the character of josephine should be just an episode movie would be much better with more focus on military tactic and genius of napoleon out of 61 victorious battles in the movie they showed 4 main character did good acting work but other characters were ease to forget i was falling asleep watching it
Dec 2 2023,negative,huge swing and a miss  when dealing with historic figure and billing a movie as epic that history matters so does actual story and true character development this movie has none of that
Dec 2 2023,negative,napoleon falls short in capturing the essence of history as it not only presents a rather dull narrative but also fails to respect the true historical events the films inability to engage viewers and its deviation from the actual historical context leave much to be desired for those seeking an authentic and compelling portrayal of napoleons story
Dec 2 2023,negative,a painful boring and disrespectful movie regarding such a relevant name in history i am not talking about a hero approach but what was done in the movie was pathetic
Dec 2 2023,positive,place was clean people were polite popcorn was hot and good movie was great
Dec 2 2023,positive,goo but left with lots of question
Dec 2 2023,negative,well went to see it anyway despite my reservations  it was an epic  epic waste of time  one of the titans of history  flawed and ultimately defeated though he was reduced to a simpering petulant ignorant randy manchild wasnt even the worst of it  so many historical inaccuracies that it made braveheart look like a documentary battles of immense complexity and tactical flair reduced to unruly charges and magical thinking like facsimile copies of the opening battle of gladiator makes me think that ridley scott only knows how to do one type of battle scene  no mention of the autodidact intellectual genius of the man or his flair for organisation his ability at diplomacy  which he was actually quite good at and his methodical replacement of legal and governance systems many of which are still in place across europe germany and italy wouldnt exist in their current forms without his reforms hate him as the original  bogeyman of europe we british might with reason but to make one of europes most interesting complex and influental characters into this playschool caricature is simply crayoning over history    some people have said well its a film its supposed to be entertainment not a documentary    fair enough  however i dont think it even delivered on that score it wasnt particularly entertaining    i still dont understand why filmakers seem to insist on making historical movies that arent historical    particularly about such interesting real characters with such interesting real stories who are so incredibly well documented by primary sources    i completely understand why a filmmaker wouldnt want to make a movie about the evolution of the napoleonic code even for lawyers that would be boring but a film about napoleons machinations to move replace and manipulate the royal houses of spain the italian states and the holy roman empire would make game of thrones look pedestrian    missing out some of the most most interesting characters in his entourage  soult ney bernadotte influential campaigns the peninsula the war of the fifth coalition  and battles  jenaauerstadt leipzig trafalgar and then butchering the few that you keep in for the sake of brevity and entertainment instead focusing not even well on a romance portrayed largely without any real emotion really doesnt do justice to how much fun this could have been instead it became a depressing 158 minutes about a petulant manchild who would have been lucky to have conquered the kindergarten let alone become  albeit for a very short time master of much of europe
Dec 2 2023,positive,well acted expected maybe something more majestic from ridley scott napoleons desire to conquer europe seemed to come easier than to conquer josephine  felt like there was a lot to tell in too short a period and thus fell a little weak all around
Dec 2 2023,negative,they could have taken one shot out of each scene summarized what little dialogue there was into a text box and made it a childrens book no meaningful character development in a story with some of histories most intriguing people the motley crue movie was more interesting and insightful
Dec 2 2023,neutral,not enough military history
Dec 2 2023,positive,acting was very good and the cinematography was amazing but be prepared for a lot of blood and guts
Dec 2 2023,positive,extremly satisfated with the whole story showed in this movie for sure it is a great movie
Dec 2 2023,neutral,it dragged at times while it was good it did not have that wow factor
Dec 2 2023,negative,the dialogue is a painful assault on the ears with cringeworthy lines delivered by a cast that seems to be sleepwalking through their roles the wooden performances make it impossible to connect with any of the characters leaving the viewer emotionally detached and indifferent to their fates its a shame to witness talented actors squandered in such a poorly conceived project    the special effects are laughably bad resembling something one might expect from a high school film project rather than a professional production from poorly rendered cgi monsters to amateurish green screen work disasterpiece fails to deliver even on the most basic visual elements
Dec 2 2023,positive,movie should have focused more on napolean the general but it was mostly about napoleon the loveralthough its a challenge to show such an important historical figures biopic in 3 hrs but expectations were still very highhowever its cinematography is excellent
Dec 2 2023,positive,best historical romance movie of the year
Dec 2 2023,positive,napoleon is surely no gladiator perhaps ridley scott has lost his spark this film just is not on the level it should be  its handsomely made has some stellar battle sequences and stunning production design and yet it leaves you feeling like you watched an insanely long bloated movie that rushed through everything its both too long and not long enough truly it felt like we were watching the greatest hits of napoleon    napoleon conquers most when ridley scott unleashes his technical prowess for the epic battle scenes the immersive sound largescale violence and filmmaking are on display in a way rarely seen today however everything outside of that is a fascinating and frustrating misfire joaquin phoenixs pathetic and often hilarious socially awkward performance clashes with the films selfseriousness to a fault while vanessa kirby is inconsistently utilized she is very good though and my god the dialogue is bad making for some truly questionable line deliveries this movie really was just a whole lot of nothing perhaps a longer runtime in the 4hour directors cut will help to fill in some gaps but until then what we have here is a handsomely mounted disappointment
Dec 2 2023,negative,more of a poor love story between napoleon and his wife josephine rather than a representation of an epic war hero awful and i feel betrayed
Dec 2 2023,positive,way too long way too slow way less story and depth the historical inaccuracies dont really bother me but the pace is awful and the argument is mixed the film feels too slow at first with little to no plot relevance to then directly spire in a lot of plot points at once having a better pace to then becoming slow again with a very predictable ending    it is a very cinematographic film mostly well directed sometimes half baked with joaquin phoenix being perfect for the role with a lackluster plot and an awful pace
Dec 2 2023,negative,so slow so borning the battle scenes were the only redeeming part but they too were excruciatingly slow not at all what i was expecting
Dec 2 2023,negative,could have been great but joaquin forgot he wasnt playing the deadpan joker act he isnt the right person for this role
Dec 2 2023,negative,napoleon seems to be stupid a simpleton leads by destinywe dont see any proof of his strategic skills  what an idea to do a movie by an englishmanworst ennemy of french during the napoleonic wars   inevitably the view is biased
Dec 2 2023,negative,long and boring theres little plot or story to capture ones attention
Dec 2 2023,negative,only enjoyed the battle scenes which were not even that great to much drama about his wife and not enough about his life left plot holes and never followed up on various things 
Dec 2 2023,negative,did not feel for any of the characters bland interpretations for an overall bland movie certainly did not do any justice to kubrick vision
Dec 2 2023,negative,it was a disappointing film about the first empire with historical errors many inaccuracies and shortcuts to summarize a rich period of history no interesting battles and very average choices eg the cannonade on the egyptian pyramids napoleons slap in the face of the empress riddley scott should have called his film josephine but that wouldnt have sold as well
Dec 2 2023,positive,i felt that the portrayal of napoleon was flat
Dec 2 2023,positive,i dont realize it was a love story interesting facts about napoleon and his struggles for power and the wars
Dec 2 2023,positive,great battle sequences great performances felt like alot of the movie was cut away just to make it a 230 hour movie instead of the full version
Dec 2 2023,positive,one of the best and most epic historical masterpieces ive ever seen the acting was incredible it was surprisingly funny and i thought the battle scenes were incredible the only complaint i have  is that i think the movie was a little too long but i highly recommend watching napoleon
Dec 2 2023,positive,i just cant imagine a better way of giving a masterpiece from a legendary director in probably his sharpest work perfectly leaded by kirby and phoenix
Dec 2 2023,positive,poorly casted using jonathon as napoleon hard to follow unless you were a historian
Dec 2 2023,negative,would not want to see again the only interesting scene was luring the other side out onto the frozen water  now that would have made for a more interesting and dramatic storyline
Dec 2 2023,positive,its good  some historical inaccuracies and may not be as focused as other bio movies but it was intertaning
Dec 2 2023,neutral,the movie lacked character development and a more interesting plot  i think the producer missed the opportunity of a portrayal of a napoleon that brought news laws through napoleonic code which expanded opportunity to the common french person  was a long and boring movie and around 30 was just plain warfare which got played out after time
Dec 2 2023,negative,slow movie that has unnecessary scenes between napoleon and his wife  save your money
Dec 2 2023,negative,ridleys  waterloo  big fail
Dec 2 2023,positive,a movie to watch in netflix instead it was  boring  in the beginning but it got better towards the end 
Dec 2 2023,positive,i went in with low expectations based on the reviews but i came away enjoying most of it phoenix seemed old and tired throughout but the battles and costumes more than made up for it in my opinion although its not as epic as gladiator or kingdom of heaven its worth watching at least once for the few scenes that were done right
Dec 2 2023,positive,napoleon was an odd film but i enjoyed it it has moments of humor violence discomfort love and i feel i learned some history which i like     i felt joaquin phoenix looked the part but his voice was not right but his cavalier tongue in cheekiness sort of won me over a little i think i was just in the right mood
Dec 2 2023,positive,i was looking forward to this movie after seeing the preview  it was an interesting history lesson and i learned a few things about the relationship btwn napoleon and josephine that i didnt know but i thought the battle scenes dragged on  so the movie wouldve been good  152 hrsnot 25  and i think if it was more of a colorful epic it wouldve been much better than the grim and gritty attempt at being real which was undermined by a ton of ai backgrounds  it was very reminiscent of ridley scotts bladerunner in the overall dark feel  im not suggesting a candycoated sophi coppola marie antoinette but it deserved more opulence than it gave  vanessa kirby was excellent but joaquin phoenix had a few jokerlike moments that were hard to overlook  he definitely embodied the role of the short guy with a big ego and looked very much like bonaparte but hes almost like jack nicholson where you see the actor himself rather than the role hes playing
Dec 2 2023,neutral,unfortunately this was disappointing the story line was just too dry and boring the battle scenes were good but that was the extent of the benefit of this movie 
Dec 2 2023,negative,my husband and i did not enjoy this movie no good dialog or anything redeeming seemed devoid of real history depressing violent in todays world this is the last way i want to spend 25 hours
Dec 2 2023,neutral,phoenixs acting was good but the movietried to cover too much so the story was a bit thin and murky
Dec 2 2023,negative,high expectations but never came close to meeting too much focus on josephine and an heir there could have been half of the time on that story and added more interesting stories about napoleon phoenixs portrayal was very poor napoleon was an incredible leader and administrator not the bumbling idiot that the movie showed i would not recommend this film 
Dec 2 2023,negative,phoenix was terrible so weird for him movie is laughably bad
Dec 2 2023,positive,everything the cast the storyline movie had it all
Dec 2 2023,negative,i wanted to like this movie because i enjoy joaquin phoenix films but this wasnt good to supposedly have been about france there were very few french accents mostly english and napoleon had an american accent it just didnt give napoleon
Dec 2 2023,positive,absolutely spellbinding it is a combination of a history lesson love story horrific battle scenes think saving private ryan and bloody scenes that made me cover my eyes should definitely be nominated for best picture
Dec 2 2023,positive,i enjoyed the epic feel to this movie joaquin phoenix had a stellar performance the war scenes were spectacular another blockbuster by ridley scott i  believe it followed history quite closely
Dec 2 2023,positive,great cast production set and story i wanted more character development to learn about napoleon and josephine too much battle scenes and they got tedious to endure movie leaves one sad and the french suffered horribly until this egomaniac brute france had a shameful history and litany of rulers 
Dec 2 2023,positive,i enjoyed it  it was slow at times and the way they skipped through the years was a bit confusing  overall i thought it was very good  i wish they showed more of his military accomplishments and less of his personal life
Dec 2 2023,negative,i guess they just cant make truly great films anymore cringe inducing in parts   and plenty of factual inaccuracies
Dec 2 2023,positive,this wouldve been better as a tv mini series
Dec 2 2023,positive,i think ridley scotts first idea is to make a 4 hours movie about napoleon but still he delivered a good movie that doesnt idolize a french character who have made a name for himself in conquering the world    great cinematography nice plots and good casting this line here will be forever a demonstration of what happen when a man reach his full potential    i have sufficiently proven to the whole world that i do not fear the chances of war but peace is my heartfelt wish
Dec 2 2023,negative,bad acting boring movie it needs some female nudity to make it worth seeing  cause it kinda sucks
Dec 1 2023,neutral,a real pity    well shot very funny in parts and fairly well acted    had it been one or two inaccuracies it would have been easily forgiven  but its wildly off repeatedly so    this should have been brilliant but its at best average    ie seen it once and doubt i will again on reflection one to wait arriving on television    massive historical blunders aside the cinematography is impressive and the costumes are well done    but between events it does drag at times it feels like scott felt that too as it fizzles out into a brief and messy rewriting of waterloo    after waiting eagerly for this to come out im very disappointed i see it as a wasted opportunity
Dec 1 2023,positive,despite its length napoleon wasnt the worst movie ive seen this year i went in completely blind to any napoleonic history however i still dont feel like i learned a lot whilst i wouldnt call this film artsy i feel like it wasnt the biopic it could have been especially with ridley scott at the helm i think i just expected more     my biggest gripe with this film however was evident from the first 5 minutes  why does napoleon have an american accent when his fellow frenchmen have english accents whatever happened to actors adopting accents i feel i would have understood this a lot more and knew who was who if the french had french accents the russians had russian accents etc etc phoenix is the only member of the cast who has this accent so perhaps it was done purposefully to make him stand out or maybe it was just lazy production either way for someone like me who knew nothing about the history i was completely lost as to who was who 35
Dec 1 2023,negative,in spite of its hollywood credential director etc the movie is laboriously long  given that almost 34 of the film is devoted to napolean  josephine love it would be better titled josephine  bottom line dont bother
Dec 1 2023,positive,it is spectacular the scenes are like paintings and the costumes are outstanding great balance between the love story and the battles
Dec 1 2023,negative,neither history nor a good story  actors are good but miscast visuals are ok but what a caricature  napoleon is portrayed as a coward and a fool what he was not according to historical reports he was indeed a megalomaniac and had a high opinion of the role he wanted to play for his country thats why he left at waterloo for instance to preserve that but portraying him as a coward is simply inaccurate and if ridley scott wants to sell us more gore effects plus at the end a little moral about war being bad he would do well in a movie about american indians 12 millions of deaths in the north only thats a lot of blood to put on screen
Dec 1 2023,positive,its easy to criticise the historical inaccurates within napoleon which felt like it was made more to be big screen spectacle but it works ridley scotts urgency to capture the political power struggle each powerpoint moment of napoleons rise with the grand scale of the brutal ugliness of the battle  in a way it all allows the 2h 38m runtime to flow smoothly   it also becomes a great performance piece for joaquin phoenix who captured napoleons ambition insecurities  the obsession with wanting to be immortalise
Dec 1 2023,positive,great acting and battle scenes that are works of art wish it had gone even longer look forward to the directors cut
Dec 1 2023,negative,it was apparent that the brit  ridley scott hates the french  he portrayed napoleon as a weak apologetic leader hardly the case of one of great war leaders of all time  where were all the quotes from napoleon and there were plenty  weak movie from the true story of napoleon
Dec 1 2023,negative,violent silly dialog and poorly acted
Dec 1 2023,negative,our family are history buffs so we were looking forward to this movie  we have been to france and to napoleons tomb  sadly we were very disappointed with the movie  napoleon was a very brilliant complex individual who somehow got an entire country to follow him  the history was inaccurate and the flow of the film was jagged  what were they trying to do with the whole josephine plot line  there was so much potential for this movie and in my opinion it was never realized
Dec 1 2023,positive,my wife and i thoroughly enjoyed the movie i did read several reviews that spoke about the movie being historically incorrect i saw the movie for its entertainment value and not to receive a very accurate history lesson if you wait to see the movie at home you will be cheating yourself out of the brilliant and very intense battle scenes
Dec 1 2023,positive,amazing story  but didnt think this movie should have starred joaquin phoenix  had potential to be better  i liked the earlier movie that the director did with matt damon  he would have been better here imo the female lead was great though
Dec 1 2023,positive,decent enough as historical films go if you wanted a french version of gladiator  this aint it
Dec 1 2023,negative,yes really rotten stupid porn sex and ridiculous violent scenes
Dec 1 2023,negative,this fiction is not interesting and josefine could be a better title indeed the ridleys napoleon has no flavour no depth no personality no emotion and no dilemma historically its the perfect representation of napoleon seen by common folks in england during 19th century but history and event arent close to any historical fact we just see too few battles with poor special effects no context on european geopolitic and tactics no emphasis on other peoples like the british empire that could be so much interesting
Dec 1 2023,neutral,alternative title dear josephine
Dec 1 2023,negative,super depressing filled with animal cruelty i know war is hell but this movie was super depressing dont waste your time  main character was very boring im glad i got to see this movie because i knew nothing about the napoleon era but it was just so sad
Dec 1 2023,negative,this film respects nothing of history another englishman who does not accept having been beaten by france
Dec 1 2023,negative,it was very dry i appreciate the love story between he and josephine but the battle scenes were good not much character profile of napoleon
Dec 1 2023,negative,i can forgive historical inaccuracies when its done in order to make the movie entertaining and with a solid story but here it wasnt the historical inaccuracies dont serve the scenario actually thats not true they serve only one scenario which is french bashing napoleon is just pictured as a ruthless boring and stupid man who beats his wife and torture innocent people the french are depicted like that as well because they still somehow follow him after his first exile there is no explanation for his action no political intrigue in this movie he is just at war against the rest of europe because of his big man syndrome nothing else
Dec 1 2023,positive,good historical presentation  good acting and visual
Dec 1 2023,negative,more a parody than a real movie its sad how such a great story can be butchered by a bad screenplay some weird casting choices and a horrible horrible editing
Dec 1 2023,positive,it was a bit weird having actors not using french accents the story was good but i didnt feel that it was compelling to me
Dec 1 2023,negative,almost 3 hours and almost none of the napoleon history was told most of the movie is focused in josephine
Dec 1 2023,positive,could of had better nepolian and josephine
Dec 1 2023,neutral,there is a 4 hour 15 minute cut of this film that will substantially improve the flow and story of this film but as it stands the theatrical cut is a bloated and convoluted mess with some epic battles and set designs an underwhelming performance shockingly from joaquin phoenix and some entertainment to be had but disappointing overall again though like most ridley scott historical epics i have zero doubt the directors cut will be the vastly superior version 
Dec 1 2023,positive,i thought the movie was historically interesting but it was very long to me a lot of the dialogue was garbled
Dec 1 2023,negative,big budget movie but joaquin phoenix was the worst of all the actors  no way was napoleon a mumbling sniffling geek like ridley scott portrays him   why would an entire country follow someone with zero charisma let alone an entire army  otherwise visually stunning
Dec 1 2023,negative,ridley scott once again blows it by recreating a history as he sees it he did the same thing with noah story example  the pillar of fire that god brings down on the egyptians to allow time for the jews to cross the sea is in the bible its a critical piece of the story a rabbis advisor told him this he ignored it    napoleon was and is considered a military genius he controlled every detail of the battlefield with an attackbased formula playing on the enemys weaknesses the portrayal in the movie at times portrays napoleon as winging it  possibly relying on luck irrationally charging into the battle himself  which gives a feeling narcissistic or megalomaniac tendencies  this was never the case  after alexander the great napoleon ranks a close second in military prowess    alexander  another great military historical story botched by oliver stone    napoleon never slapped joséphine across the face in fact its historically proven napoleon was a womens rights advocate  many of the laws followed today in courts and how society is governed came from things napoleon put in place    scott ruins a great story by supposing josephine was napoleons achilles heel  at times during the boring historical accounting in this movie scott tries to alter history by making napoleon seem weak behind closed doors and relying on josephines approval or guidance  it completely pathetic    and when the end of the movie comes the political statement arrives when we see the writing on the screen showing all the battles napoleon won but with the dash mark and the total men lost in each battle giving us the final tally of 3 million plus yeah  lots of people die battle war is bad but even jesus said there will be wars and rumors of war until my next coming  history is rich with lessons learned from leaders war and peace  something napoleon was actually trying to achieve scott fails once again with a shitty movie on a nonfiction subject matter    what is comical about ridley scott is he makes a better fiction movie gladiator where his main character is a war general massacring the enemy brutal in battle unforgiving and we are supposed to love that character  and we do     but real life ones  he needs to emasculate the males build up the women and basically change history its a sin to not see history as it was and creating an alternate universe is simply bullshit    i went into this movie  knowing ridley scott couldnt possibly do this leader justice much the same oliver stone couldnt show alexander the great as the greatest leader both political and military and dont get me wrong all human beings are flawed you can show that if it based on factual historical data  the napoleon museum in paris is a must see and is a rich part of french history clearly a monument to a leader loved by the people  its a romantic war story in history    sadly ridley scotts napoleon is unwatchable a second time my suggestion is dont waste your money on even one time
Dec 1 2023,negative,this movie tried to do too much and failed to do anything well it was long and boring in my opinion the acting was okay and the battles were loud and long very confusing as it jumped from time and place in such a clunky way
Dec 1 2023,positive,its an interesting look into the live and timeperiod of one of histories more sinister characters but to me it failed to approach the deeper questions of why napolean did the things he did still there are plenty of highlights here especially in regards to the action setpieces
Dec 1 2023,positive,visually impressive  vanessa kirby had the meatiest role and leaned into it really well  joaquin phoenix played a mixture of standard dark and brooding phoenix and marlon brandos col kurtz  this film was very episodic and teased but did not delve into the complex and fascinating relationship between napolean and josephine  napoleans ascension to the throne twice was glossed over without real historical depth and context like shakespeares historical plays this would have been much more enjoyable if you had a good knowledge of european and napoleonic history going into it  on that basis it would have been a meaningful set of engaging vignettes
Dec 1 2023,negative,great costume design terrible depiction of napoleon it should have been called josephine and her simp
Dec 1 2023,positive,i enjoyed it a little slow in the middle and rushed around the edges i was still able to follow and it was visually spectacular
Dec 1 2023,negative,i personaly think that it is a fiction and not an historical movie joacquin phoenix is a great actor but not fit at all in napoléon who were 25 years younger that the actor the movie doesnt at all explain the political issues of that time neither than it explain and present other character than napoleon and josephine its to bad it present an english propaganda image of bonaparte a ridicule looser angry speaking like a dumb i was expected so much from ridley scott after movies like duelistes
Dec 1 2023,positive,its got some impressive set pieces and acting but it wont be enough to make it stand out over other scott epix
Dec 1 2023,positive,good movie historically accurate
Dec 1 2023,negative,soooo disappointing   could and should have been so much better
Dec 1 2023,negative,if the man was a coward loser with a boring tale to tell then this is your movie all action is in the trailer the movie might even have less action than the trailer i recommend pillows and blankets for this lullaby of a film
Dec 1 2023,positive,its historical accuracy may be well off its tracks but napoleon still holds together with the powerful performances of phoenix and kirby and brutal fighting scenes
Dec 1 2023,positive,ridley scott does excellent battle scenes very well done phoenix damn good actor rest of cast were well done  a few minor historical inaccuracies but overall fine film on a controversial and complex man and his times
Dec 1 2023,positive,so refreshing to see people that are usually depicted as dignified acting as debaucherous and violent as modern idiots both the epic action scenes and the relationship drama ones really worked for me i dont understand why they chose to have a couple lines said by minor characters not in english
Dec 1 2023,negative,so what was it about
Dec 1 2023,negative,238 hours of random battles doesnt explore any aspect of napoleons life if youre making a not strictly historical film make it at least gripping
Dec 1 2023,positive,some good battle scenes could not make up for a choppy story that played like a greatest hits collection  phoenix and kirby had no chemistry
Dec 1 2023,positive,it was an epic historical movie worth watching on the screen it had both good and bad moments though it has flaws it made me more interested to learn more about napoleon this would have been a better movie as a series so that each period in napoleons life could be told in more detail as it is now the movie is choppy without proper transition though joaquin phoenix napoleon adequately portrays napoleon at an older age a younger actor could have portrayed napoleon as a dynamic leader in his rise to power otherwise he couldnt have gained the support of his soldiers and citizens
Dec 1 2023,negative,only visually beautiful thats it  not historically accurate no good acting
Dec 1 2023,positive,ridley scotts bigscale historical piece napoleon is an engaging but imperfect study of the french emperors ascent and descent joaquin phoenix gives a strong portrayal of the central figure embodying his intelligence aspiration and harshness with unwavering force the films expansive range and extensive storyline cannot be denied however it stumbles under its own lofty goal this leads to a persistent feeling of unfulfilled potential    scott showcases his directing skills brilliantly through the movies largescale battle scenes these scenes create a real raw feel showing wars harsh and aggressive side in a clear vibrant manner you can almost feel the metal clashing and hear the loud cannon sounds that transport you right into the midst of the battle dariusz wolskis camerawork for the movie is equally excellent capturing the splendour of the napoleonic era with an artistically meticulous eye    even though napoleon showcases technical mastery it stumbles in achieving a solid emotional impact the movies storytelling method flits between various stages of napoleons life its occasionally puzzling it can make it hard to consistently bond with the main character furthermore the films exploration of napoleons personal lifein particular his tumultuous marriage to josephineseems inadequate it misses the emotional intensity that could have launched the movie past its historical setting    phoenixs role as napoleon is definitely the movies highlight he fills the character with a blend of charm fervour and susceptibility crafting a compelling and intricate individual he showcases napoleons bright mind his unyielding quest for control and his profound insecurities each of which enhances his enthralling personality  despite its faults napoleon is an eyecatching thoughtprovoking movie it gives a peek into the life of a historical character thats puzzling and i learned a lot phoenix really shines making the ticket price totally worth it besides the magnificent war scenes in the film are a delight to watch still the movies inconsistent storyline and weak heart restrict it from truly becoming a masterpiece
Dec 1 2023,positive,so often reviewers are so caught up in writing very eloquent reviews with big words or pissed with historical accuracy but in the end one should come out of the theatre either feeling entertained or not and i was yes the battle scenes should have shown more of the mans genius military strategy yes it painted him at times as kind of pathetic in his personal life but you try make a perfect movie about a story that big it was a good movie with solid acting that just suffered from some pacing issues  do you need to race to the cinema no would it be fine to wait till it streams yes
Dec 1 2023,negative,a movie whose script seems to be taken from the english propaganda of the period and transported to modern times all battles are not as are supposed to be and some are completely modified with absurdities waterloo is an insult and a mockery austerlitz is a smack to the face to the intelligence of who led armies  the movie itself is boring   phoenix was obviously not needed his talent is not used in this movie and somebody else could fill the shoes of napoleon  excellent costumes though
Dec 1 2023,positive,good story but it dragged in some places
Dec 1 2023,negative,not hard to believe the film was directed by an englishman battle scenes were great but no generals were given any roles in the battles or the film the dramatic love story of napoleon and josephine was  yawn   british propaganda from 200 years ago brought to the sliver screen
Dec 1 2023,negative,why bother doing an historical movie if you wont care about history at all also this movie should have been called josephine and napoleon cause there is so little about the relevant parts of napoleons life the only good thing is the visual effects in the inaccurates battles
Dec 1 2023,negative,who was napoleon i still dont know     after watching 2 12 hours i thought id get an insight into the man and it wasnt to be found joaquin phoenix who i think is wonderful in general was terribly miscast poorly directed and just didnt do a good job he gave no clue into who the man was deep inside it was a veneer at best it was never clear what the true relationship was between him and josephine being stoic or frowning is not an answer to whats going on his narration over his letters to josephine were as flat and unemotional and unrevealing as could be it was as if someone was just reading lines    as for the movie in general it was never clear what the message was if there was a message his longlasting accomplishments to society and transgressions were ignored altogether and scotts decision to let every actor speak in english with their own accents was a bad one in war scenes were they french austrian english german who knows the emperor of russia had a french accent napoleon american some british irish all over place it was tough to figure out who to root for if anyone     multiple times during the movie the audience started laughing at scenes that werent meant to be funny and i found myself laughing in agreement thinking yeah that was pretty stupid there were some pretty fantastic scenes which i wont mention for fear of being a spoiler to be sure but at times you wanted some war scenes to just end     during the movie i recalled that stanley kubrick wanted to do a movie about napoleon but didnt because right before going into the endeavor a movie on napoleon had just come out but if you married paths of glory and barry lyndon and added kubricks genius it could have been brilliant view into napoleon instead ridley scotts napoleon was a 5 hour movie with a running time of 2 hours and 38 minutes
Dec 1 2023,negative,i have been an avid movie goer since i was a kid growing up in the 70s and 80s but this was the first time i had ever felt like walking out of a movie  my tastes are wide  i just love cinema and enjoy everything from star wars classic and modern scifi and fantasy jane austen adaptions and historical epics my current favourite directors are denis villeneuve and christopher nolan and in the past i have been drawn to films by stephen spielberg peter weir george miller m night shylaman james cameron and yes ridley scott i loved the alien films and enjoyed gladiator while recognising its flaws well those flaws are on show in this film x 100     there is no added nuance to napoleons character apart from the caricature of a petulant childish narcissist no attempt to really explain why his troops would follow him to into battle with such fervour and with only a cursory examination of his battlefield genius its hard to really grasp why the powers that be fell over themselves to crown him emperor oh i know the historical analysis of napoleons appeal but this film does nothing to suggest he had any charisma or true leadership qualities besides his battlefield abilities josephine is rendered as a loose woman with very little effort to explain how it was necessary for her to flirt and bestow her favours in order to survive she is bullied and belittled by napoleon yet we are supposed to believe in the great love story other historical figures are one note and forgettable    this is phoenixs worst performance and im a fan believing he fully deserved his oscar for the joker despite not really enjoying that movie i didnt want to walk out though because of phoenixs performance vanessa kirby does a marvellous job with what she is given and shines above all the dour men  a cavalcade of decent international actors phoning in roles that they were probably happy to have in the time of covid    the cinematographer is decent especially in the battle scenes which is the reason beside vanessa kirby this film gets and extra half star from me but game of thrones did it better there are some jarring choices are they trying to symbolise the fact that napoleon is short with those low camera angles the only clever choice was to focus on kirbys face as she acted through the stilted lines with grace    over all a major disappointment i had some time to myself today and saw that my local cinema was showing this for half price so i decided to treat myself to some popcorn and settle in for an historical epic well they do say you get what you pay for
Dec 1 2023,positive,a good retelling of napoleons ascension to the commander of almost the world  albeit way too hectic theres no real good way to fit the story into a sub 3 hour timeslot however riley scott tries way too much  i understand the basic instinct and need to sometimes add a human emotional side to any story but  nom nom nom scene was just downright weird phoenix definitely added his normal strangeness to the acting but like many times before this didnt work for the film for me
Dec 1 2023,negative,nothing great a movie that is way too long
Dec 1 2023,positive,the movie should have been called josephine the story focuses almost entirely on his relationship with his wife and events back home i think she had more screen time than him very little of the movie actually focuses on the battles he won and wars he fought the battle scenes that were included were very well done but that is it 
Dec 1 2023,positive,a movie to remember the battle scenes are spectacular and lengthy costumes of the soldiers really look amazing i learned some new things and i enjoyed the portrayal of napoleon as rather lumpy and moody unique and rewarding this is my favorite movie this year
Dec 1 2023,positive,very slow in parts  there were more parlor scenes than battle scenes  this movie did not have to be 2 hours and 35 minutes long
Dec 1 2023,positive,it was good but not great the visuals were very nice due to the imax cameras and the sound design was amazing the story rushed a fair bit of napoleons life due to the extended battle scenes which makes up a fair bit of the screen time
Dec 1 2023,negative,es una mala película sosa y aburrida a parte de que aunque al inicio comienza muy bien con la muerte de maría antonieta y con el asenso de napoleón en el ejercito francés tiene malas transiciones un mal manejo de la trama la cual se baso en napoleón bonaparte el mayor general de guerra de toda la historia    it is a bad film dull and boring apart from the fact that although at the beginning it begins very well with the death of marie antoinette and the rise of napoleon in the french army it has bad transitions poor management of the plot which was based  is napoleon bonaparte the greatest war general in all of history
Dec 1 2023,positive,this film was awesome brilliant scenes and action  wish they made more like this i think  most viewers are too dumb for this film
Dec 1 2023,negative,it passed the time but very very slowly  what a yawn
Dec 1 2023,neutral,very slow dialogue lackingnapoleon had a flat affect most of the time very few romantic scenes battle scenes were good but could have had more
Dec 1 2023,negative,there were lots of gory war scenes a smattering of quickie sex scenes and not a lot else unless you are a student of french history much of the movie is lost on you  who are all those characters and why are they important  other than napoleon and josephine very little is explained  there was also essentially no character development other than napoleon and josephine  overall i was very disappointed
Dec 1 2023,positive,good documentary and good as gold
Dec 1 2023,positive,joaquin phoenix delivered the strange little general as only he can the visuals are epic and the emotions palpable  go see this in the theater
Dec 1 2023,positive,napoleon as a movie is fine  even verging on good however it lacks the ability to truly show napoleons bite and never completely lands its narrative cohesively considering how much of a brilliant strategist napoleon is meant to be one could argue there are only two battles in the movie that show this ability other victories show his power but scott perhaps in wanting to present his human flaws arguably throws in just as many failures  considering its length the first third is very choppy darting through napoleons history at a ridiculous pace barely stopping o breathe  additionally though we are told the people love napoleon it struggles to sell why they would love him one wonders if key scenes had been cut to speed the movie up whatever the reason a lot was left for the audience to work out and draw their own conclusions     sadly the fight scenes where scott has shone in the past with the likes of gladiator and kingdom of heaven felt drab  clothed in shade and uninteresting this may have been a stylistic choice  but considering the length of these sequences it doesnt make them particularly enjoyable to watch      there is plenty to engage with the movie phoenix and kilby are both brilliant and their intentional awkward chemistry will have you feeling both disturbed and moved by their romance and delusions of grandeur there are also a few moments that are genuinely funny in an otherwise intense film and thankfully they fit the tone of the moments its just a shame that it struggles to land considering all the talent involved
Dec 1 2023,negative,disappointed  the battle scenes were very  well done   story was boring
Dec 1 2023,negative,it actually makes me mad to make a historical movie this bad a movie about napoleon might be released every 20 years not showing kutuzov general murat is a shame the depiction of brooding is just a top down 5 seconds zoom i felt awkwardly ashamed watching this americanised hollywood goofy depiction of everyone could have been funny if it has been a marvel movie
Nov 30 2023,positive,this is a good but not great movie but any movie with napoleon as the main protagonist will probably stymie most directors this version too heavily emphasizes his relationship with josephine at the expense of other momentous events napoleon was at the center of among them selling the vast territory of louisiana to the fledgling us to begins its march to empire true enough hollywood is not interested in being a rival of the history channel but when real history coincides with dramatic events that shake the world why rely on a soap opera between a horny corsican and a libertine aristocrat
Nov 30 2023,positive,honestly if the few battle scenes werent there it would be a shty movie it focused way too much on his little love story imo
Nov 30 2023,negative,the historical side of the movie was cut to absolute minimum and simplified as much as possible there are a lot of smaller and bigger historical mistakes and distortions but i wasnt expect anything more from americans at this point i sense the director wanted to put his own vision of napoleon in viewers minds instead of showing him who he truly was the stenography costumes and battle scenes was pretty good so i dont consider this film as total failure but still unfortunately that was huge disappointment for me
Nov 30 2023,neutral,i wasnt really into it most of the narrative felt rushed and the romance was rather uninteresting to watch even though its historically accurate in a sense but nicelooking battles
Nov 30 2023,positive,dark glad i didnt live in those times  if napoleon was a sullen man joaquin should win the oscar for best portrayal  realistic battle scenes
Nov 30 2023,positive,the costumes cinematography and acting were brilliant however there were missed opportunities to build napoleons character through his mother and brother  as well as josephine  i walk away from the film not knowing anymore than what i learned in old textbooks
Nov 30 2023,positive,i absolutely loved this movie
Nov 30 2023,positive,an epic movie in line with all the other great movies made by ridley scott
Nov 30 2023,positive,the movie was okay but a bit too long and confusing sometimes the title of the movie should be napoleon and josephine as it is clearly main focus of the movie
Nov 30 2023,negative,i want my 2 12 hours back horrible depiction do yourself a favor pick something else dont waste your time or money
Nov 30 2023,positive,its hard to put 20 years or so of someones life into 2 and a half hours but that is all the time you get to see the life of a man who is famous to you if you are french but only know of the name if you are not  see the movie it is a bit of history you may not know
Nov 30 2023,neutral,i found it rather boring and the character of napoleon rather brutish and not really interesting too much  emphasis on the relationship with josephine and not enough on the history it was hard to follow and i actually know the history
Nov 30 2023,negative,its many years since we walked out of a film but the scene at austerlitz was the final straw battles and bonking all done badly we are regular cinema goers but this was another example of more in terms of film length is not better
Nov 30 2023,positive,great historical look at french revolution as well as the many battles that occurred during napoleons time  the battle scenes were excellent and overall both my wife and i really liked the movie   perhaps a little room much time was spent on the love story with josephine but overall this was time well spent   the sour pusses who issued terrible reviews get hung up on thinking this type of movie should reflect 100 historical accuracy and i dont think that is always possible
Nov 30 2023,negative,this film shouldnt have been called napolean it should have been named napoleans troubled relationship with josephine and his mommy issues
Nov 30 2023,negative,my thoughts exactly 
Nov 30 2023,neutral,for the run time it skips a lot of napoleons life its as if he time warps acting was fine however not the best napoleon biopic
Nov 30 2023,negative,this movie is a definition of a mindlife crisis with scenes drifting one after another without clear theme or direction  it cant decide whether it is a historic epic or a comedic period drama is it trying to make a point about ambition subvert great men narrative tell a twisted love story or critique war in general  cinematography is top notch making the voidness of the whole thing that more tragic
Nov 30 2023,positive,it was a great story learned a great deal about napoleon
Nov 30 2023,negative,one of the worst historical epics ever created the writing for this was sadly laughable they picked a man that came from practically nothing who rose to be the most powerful man on the european continent before his downfall and just butchered his story and our continents history     they leave out most of the most important parts of the napoleonic wars such as italy  spain its extremely sad and disappointing how the writers of this film have only taken the parts of history that was actually just anti frenchnapoleon propaganda from the 1800s not factual history of the man or his campaigns i had hoped that the inaccuracies would be minimal and good amounts of the real story of napoleon used but this film is now 010 from me wasnt even an enjoyable watch really it was a meh film may as well have been a made for tv production instead and many historical straight to tv stuff are far better than this multi millions hollywood production     if people are looking for a napoleon thing worth watching then id say watch the tv series napoléon 2002 instead its far more worth your time than this film is
Nov 30 2023,negative,i didnt like the fact that the preview consisted of tv shows instead of movies the previews lasted 30mins when they say the movie starts at 6pm it means the previews start at 6pm and the actual movie starts at 630645pm then i thought this movie was going to touch on history and more war related film this was a complicated love story that was overly sexualized not what i expected from this film maybe this shouldve been released on a streaming app instead
Nov 30 2023,positive,i thought the film was ok good performance and interesting take on napoleon but i felt disappointed that we didnt get to know more about the conquers knowledge of the battlefield in my opinion the film focuses too much on his flaws both as a lover and as a emperor
Nov 30 2023,negative,the movie is a directors take on napoleon who chose to pick as the main theme of the movie the relationship between napoleon and his wife a weird awkward relationship that took most of the film and was not the best choice at all    also i think the actor that was cast for napoleon did not fit with the real historical character that is unless of course the director hated napoleon and wanted to portray him as a weak pathetic man     before seeing this movie i saw a quote by ridley scott something like if you werent there shut up its like i say it is that pretty much sums up the entire movie might as well have been a movie about elves with a great leader napoleon taking on other elves from various kingdoms told by ridley scott with some weird and short resemblances with real history and an obsessive focus on his relationship at home that did not do much for the rest of the movie    as a side note i think the movie not only did not make the french look great but made the english look great the life and accomplishments of napoleon his unification of france the revolutionary laws and all that did not matter at all to the director overall the family problems of napoleon seemed much more important than his career    i also have a lot of doubts about the way most characters behave in the movie as i dont think people behaved like that in the 18th century but hey i wasnt there and apparently ridley scott was
Nov 30 2023,positive,really liked this a lot funnier than i would have thought
Nov 30 2023,positive,the battle scenes were very interesting and captivating felt very real  overall the story itself dragged on longer than necessary
Nov 30 2023,positive,the movie was slow paced but i enjoyed it wasnt focused on wars and combat but more on some social aspects of his life
Nov 30 2023,negative,acceptable on an aesthetic level but they do not have any historical rigor but what is even worse it changes history to present napoleon as a bloodthirsty moron without showing the great historical and social importance that this great character had apart from his role as a great strategist it could have been one of the movies of the time but its a big piece of garbage unforgivable
Nov 30 2023,positive,although a terrific actor joaquin phoenix as napoleon appears to be sleeping in the saddle it almost seems he decided to phone his performance in however his scenes with kirby as josephine who buy all measures was the love of his life were nothing short of riveting also the battle scenes were outstanding but i just cannot say the movie rang the bell as a classic such as many by director ridley scott
Nov 30 2023,positive,i wanted more color in the movie  the color was pretty flat   i also wanted additional lighting for the scenes  pretty flat        acting was very good    it had some pretty epic scenes that are indeed worth watching    6 out of 10
Nov 30 2023,positive,napoleon ridley scotts latest biopic about the french emperor falls short in its attempt to compellingly tell the story despite impressive battle scenes a standout performance by vanessa kirby and scotts reunion with joaquin phoenix after more than two decades the film is hampered by a screenplay that fails to adequately explore napoleons personality or address crucial episodes of his life the lack of character development depth coupled with a confusing structure and an outofplace ironic tone leaves napoleon as a work that fails to do justice to the characters legacy becoming a disappointment in scotts filmography
Nov 30 2023,negative,this movie was so blatantly historically inaccurate the acting was really poor napoleon was portrayed as a meek weird little man this was so bad my husband and i got up and left i wish i could get my money back
Nov 30 2023,negative,ok they should have named the film josephine so sick of her now what a miss on this one very poor rendition of napoleon soooo much was left out from such an interesting period of time almost criminal was really expecting more but this one sucked
Nov 30 2023,negative,this wasnt so much a movie but rather a shortened version of a streaming series there was around six battles and very well done they were and probably around six bonks sufficient for a bonk and a battle every episode as such it was disjointed as a movie and lacked any real story essentially napoleon was a costume drama and the costumes were mightily good that might have been about anyone nelson and mrs hamilton if you like historical costume drama then save your money and join the streaming service
Nov 30 2023,positive,here the obligatory question is would it have been better in other hands its not that the film itself is bad its achilles heel is that the dramatic level is uneven throughout the 150 minutes and leaves the blessed doubt of how faithful it is to the real story or how they exaggerated
Nov 30 2023,negative,the main character is the only individual in the entire movie with a distinct american accent  im confused because he nailed the accent in gladiator  i was so excited to see this and feel let down
Nov 30 2023,positive,i had no idea that it was so much of a love story      i knew the history but did not know some of these details that really changed my impression of him
Nov 30 2023,negative,the movie fails to engross the audience thanks to an excessive number of cuts that result in a tedious viewing experience if youre considering your next film id recommend exploring alternative options rather than investing time in this one despite initial expectations for phoenix to be a standout cinematic experience it unfortunately falls short of delivering on its promising premise
Nov 30 2023,negative,i was so looking forward to this movie was very disappointed
Nov 30 2023,positive,in many ways i feel that this movie is as ambitious as the man himself but ultimately as doomed to failure     i appreciate the attempt to describe napoleon through his relationship with his beloved josephine its not a bad idea in isolation when considering the constraints of the films length but ultimately we see a fairly narrow minded perspective of the man the movie never really communicates why napoleon was a great man it simply tells us that he was and then proceeds to show us how this viewpoint is flawed it feels as if the subliminal intent is to diminish napoleon rather than authentically describe the multifaceted man that he was at times brilliant and at others a narcissist acting under the guidance of hubris  this was a disappointment to me but i am hopeful that it may be rectified in the rumored directors cut releasing digitally at some point in the future      on the positive side the battle sequences in particular of austerlitz and waterloo are brilliantly shot and appropriately grand i cannot vouch one way or the other for the extent of the historical accuracy of these scenes but if nothing else they are entertaining    i recommend the movie as i appreciate the ambition and ultimately enjoyed the film but just like napoleon it is flawed
Nov 30 2023,negative,napoleon is both visually spectacular and sadly disappointing  for most of the movie phoenix portrays the famous emperor and general as sullen and charmless  with interspersed moments of incomprehensible silliness though shorter in length than some recent releases it seems long and dull the visually stunning battle scenes though worthy fail to compensate for the disjointed narrative apart from the fabled josephine most of the supporting historical  characters are portrayed as fleeting cameos  joaquin phoenix has never been among my favourite actors and his performance here does nothing to change my mind i expected more from ridley scott  when compared with other expensive biopics of famous figures such as the lion in winter  amadeus or ghandi it is average at best i will leave lawrence of arabia out of the mix as it would be unfair to both ridley and lean great historical figures need great performances we dont get it here  i know already that  others will disagree and i look forward to hearing from you
Nov 30 2023,positive,not bad and not good
Nov 30 2023,negative,when hollywood takes on european history the result is always thin on the ground crucial parts of napoleons story are missing here his prehistory in corsica the italian campaign to name just two the whole thing is like a music video short concise and says nothing picking out details to get your own message across is not really quality work even the battles were badly staged even waterloo from 1970 was more convincing an indictment of ridley scott 54 years later he can only manage this at television level
Nov 30 2023,positive,the movie feels disjointed and lacks impactful connection to the viewer
Nov 30 2023,negative,worst movie ever historical nonsence they should give this movie another name and mention that it is pure fiction  the preformance of the actors is also really cheap
Nov 30 2023,negative,it was okayish i hated the representation of napoleon they kinda turned him into dweeb i taught the actor was definitely the wrong choice they also made it look like all the victorys were down to napoleon which was unfair napoleon had some great generals under him for whom loved him the film work was excellent the scenes in the old buildings was beautiful done a really good job the battle scene were a joke terrible they had napoleon do cavalry charge in the battle of waterloo which is pure ridiculous they also over sexualised the era making social scenes like balls into somewhat of an orgy  which is madness but if you can look past that the clearly fiction story the try to show it was amusing and entertaining at time even do my other half fell asleep and dont even get me started on the actor they got to play wellington horrible
Nov 30 2023,positive,gratuitous sex  scenes were unnecessary  did not advance  the movie forward
Nov 30 2023,positive,the movie was epic  the battle scenes were quite stunning but the personal drama side of the movie was lacking there was little or no chemistry between napoleon and josesphine napoleon showing little warmth to her  she just as dispassionate the passion was spoken of not acted and who dreamt up those sex scenes which looked like napoleon needed a quick minute and a half of relief you would do well to read a valued biography of napoleon before taking this movie as history that aside youll enjoy it
Nov 30 2023,neutral,the acting and cinematography were outstanding but there were places where the screen titles transitioned too quickly and they were difficult to read
Nov 30 2023,negative,poorl old boney  bad acting from mr p
Nov 30 2023,positive,everything joaquin phoenix acted  a
Nov 30 2023,positive,mediocre script  but beautiful action scenes pretty light on history
Nov 30 2023,neutral,they made napoleon look silly and not the stature he would have carried in those days
Nov 30 2023,positive,great film a little slow at times but great storytelling
Nov 30 2023,positive,very interesting wellacted intense battle scenes were sometimes a bit too graphic but war isnt pretty
Nov 30 2023,positive,with crazy good performances and beautiful set pieces this a story thats worth the watch time
Nov 30 2023,positive,very well done and informative great casting
Nov 30 2023,positive,not entirely historically accurate and some details left out but it was fun
Nov 30 2023,positive,can we just take a second to appreciate that someone as old as ridley scott is this passionate and motivated enough to still make movies i am very happy that i saw this in theaters as i never got to see many of his other movies in theaters the epic battle scenes he directs are made for the big screen as well as the dramatic and captivating performances of the legendary joaquin phoenix and vanessa kirby very fascinating characters and everything that revolves around napoleons personality and ego with both his political leadership and his marriage i found to be quite the character exploration and worthy of analysis the movie held my attention pretty much the entire time while some things may not be entirely history accurate and while it does jump around a lot between years the filmmaking and writing are still done well i liked it and would recommend it for serious movie goers
Nov 30 2023,negative,so weak epic fail
Nov 30 2023,positive,very factual  a lot of action in the movie
Nov 30 2023,positive,entertaining historical very interesting figure
Nov 30 2023,negative,how did they manage to make one of the biggest character in history seem so small and dull oh i would say by focusing far too much on josephine and not spending nearly enough time on developing the guy the movie was named for
Nov 30 2023,positive,too funny to hate too weird to ignore
Nov 30 2023,positive,there were too many romantic scenes and he was a little all over the place but the battle scenes were epics
Nov 30 2023,negative,couldnt take anything away from this movie no dramasuspense no real historical content average acting performances and the cinematography was disappointing found myself looking at my watch to see how long more i had to endure
Nov 30 2023,positive,it exceeded my expectations  i will see it again
Nov 30 2023,positive,it was an ok movie however they made him out to be a very beta figure he looked very weak they could of showed less of josefine they did not hit on other aspects of the history how he conquered italy or showed the russian war of 1812 it fell a little flat for me but the ice war was a phenomenal scene
Nov 30 2023,negative,joaquin phoenix gives a poor performance and the movie is filled with inaccuracies a person of the stature of bonapart is treated as a caricature
Nov 30 2023,neutral,an exemplary display of craftsmanship art and camera work with plenty of believable effects  the story is vacuous unfulfilling and boring as hell
Nov 30 2023,positive,napoleon is as narratively disjointed as it is epic but the intense battle scenes and ridley scotts largescale direction are more than worth the price of admission
Nov 30 2023,negative,any writerdirectoractor trio who sign off on a line of dialogue like this lamb chop is my destiny need to be committed to a correctional facility  joaquin phoenix has genuinely earned a razzie
Nov 30 2023,positive,i can say i enjoyed it but semireluctantly it was too long though joaquin phoenix is a very good actor the scripted portrayal of napoleon seemed somewhat dubious the battle scenes were horrifyingly welldone but the carnage difficult to even consider and oh the poor horses  the love story of napoleon and josephine felt somewhat tawdry my impression of that couple as one of the great romances in history may be due to my relative ignorance of the actual history costumes and scenery were great and i really loved both the unsurprising and the unusual music chosen as soundtrack all in all worth seeing but i left feeling like it could have been a much better film
Nov 30 2023,neutral,while ridley scotts napolean has plenty working in its favor it also has more than its fair share of issues  on the plus side of the ledger there are some striking battle scenes most notable among them the harrowing battle of austerlitz  as well there are some memorable images including the burning of moscow  there is also a great performance from vanessa kirby as joesphine napoleans alluring but beleaguered love interest  however joaquin phoenix while doing his best often looks more like the harvey keitel character from bad lieutenant than he does napolean  on top of that the movie needs to pick a lane and stick to it  romance or war film  so as not to dilute the water  and why does the movie have such a murky look to it as though the whole thing was shot through a cheesecloth filter  you cant help but get the feeling that napolean is an okay movie that should have been great
Nov 30 2023,negative,it reveals what is so wrong with the big director image of filmmaking  there are very few talented big directors christopher nolan among them because most of them like ridley scott have zero talent as screenwriters
Nov 30 2023,negative,this film is an embarrassment to everyone involved in its production
Nov 30 2023,positive,the movie is great the battle scenes are well done it should have been called napoleon and josephine as she has a major role an error she died from pneumonia not diphtheria
Nov 30 2023,negative,fell asleep several times boring as hell
Nov 30 2023,negative,it would be easier to forgive this film for its mediocrity if there werent infinite opportunities for better storytelling in napoleons life the screenplay could have been sketched out in about 15 minutes by reading wikipedia the timeline of major events in napoleons military career was clumsily overlaid upon his relationship with josephine as a result neither storyline shines napoleon and josephine would make a compelling drama without any of the battlefield showing off that scott cant resist or napoleon as a singular figure in just the russian campaign or just waterloo could provide enough content for a 3 hour film and a 10part miniseries but what we got was a shallow summary that is chockablock with opportunities to stop moving so damn fast and just tell a story i love historical films and have read extensively on this era makes this film extra disappointing since i was excited for it
Nov 30 2023,positive,while i definitely enjoyed napoleon i did not love it there were definitely a few scenes and plot points that could have been shortened and others that could have been given more focus and i know this to be true because ridley scott himself said he has a 5 hour cut of this film some of the humor fell a little flat but overall i still enjoyed the film had chilling war sequences especially sublime music wonderful performances and despite the rough editing still had a strong execution for the story it set out to tell
Nov 30 2023,positive,very disappointing movie  dull bland no soul to it 
Nov 30 2023,positive,well made film and interesting history lesson  lots of battle scenes  excellent acting
Nov 29 2023,negative,torture for someone who knows the real story missing the greatest moments of his life not telling the most important and exciting parts if the title was napoleon and josephine you could say ok in which case of course the movie would never be profitable the level of ridley scotts ignorance is astonishing while watching this movie i felt the same anger when i see someone pouring coke in a glass of 100 years old cognac disgraceful
Nov 29 2023,negative,a colossal failure from a storytelling perspective  the screenwriter has to be the biggest fraud to write for a film i have no problem if you hate napoleon ridley scott but atleast convince the audience why you hate him done with an agenda ridley scott does not have the integrity to tell a story without any bias and this is the ultimate failure for any storyteller
Nov 29 2023,negative,absolute rubbishsave your money the french will not like the portrayal of their national hero he comes across as unsure of himself and not the leader we are led to believe he was  battle scenes were good and well done  but too many crude sex scenes find it hard to believe that napoleon and josephine got down and dirty under the beakfast table in front of the servants
Nov 29 2023,negative,ridley scott continues his downward spiral with the likes of the disrespectful and distorted production of noah   napoleon is no better   could have been a really good movie but the powers behind these films lack a commitment to classical film quality and are so driven by a left world that it pollutes their films   unless ridley scott and the others behind this film have a revival i will not pay money to see another of thier films   gladiator can carry you only so farthat was almost a quarter century ago
Nov 29 2023,negative,terrible representation of a great historical figure walked out 30 minutes into the movie
Nov 29 2023,positive,it was a great movie the main characters were developed well you were left feeling like you understood them as real people and their relationship it was able to help you comprehend a turbulent period of history and see how it shaped napoleon i am a history buff and my girlfriend likes romances we both loved it and talked about it for hours afterwards go with a friend or friends because youll want to talk about it afterwards
Nov 29 2023,negative,napoleon it should be titled josephine i didnt leave the cinema out of respect for the director and actors but aside from the fight scenes the rest is completely useless historically its also a disaster i hope the directors cut is better
Nov 29 2023,positive,it was pretty good the career narrative was easy to follow phoenix was almost tolerable it was mildly entertaining it was not a bad movie
Nov 29 2023,positive,i thought it was great in spite of all the violence in it but i knew that he was involved in a lot of wars during his career as a military man and emperor of france so i was prepared for it  i feared for all those horses used in the film and pray none of them were injured or accidentally killed during the filming  napoleon is far better than most of the crap coming out of hollywood these days
Nov 29 2023,positive,an epic portrayal of napoleons reign  fascinating cinematography that made me feel like i wasnt a passive observer but actually at that place in time  engaging from beginning to end
Nov 29 2023,positive,very good depiction of the battles of the time period joaquin phoenix did a wonderful job as napoleon
Nov 29 2023,negative,to much blood   some dialog obscured by battle noises
Nov 29 2023,negative,there is just nothing this movie adds it just rushes through some facts makes it all so shallow and banal film seem to lack an idea battlefield scenes are probably good  for those who are into battle scenes
Nov 29 2023,negative,you can tell they spent a lot of money on this film for costumes and the battle scenes but the acting was terrible joaquin who is normally great was not good it was like he was phoning in his performance and at times was difficult to understand
Nov 29 2023,positive,great acting and action scenes
Nov 29 2023,negative,this was a beautiful looking film with a choppy story this was like a high school history class text book come to life only briefly touching on an historical event before moving on to the next event i wasnt impressed with the acting or maybe it was poor casting the acting was lazy from great actors who went with the default british accent to represent all characters from all regions in a period piece like has been the hollywood way for the longest phoenix chose his normal american accent by far kirby was the standout which isnt a surprise
Nov 29 2023,positive,ignoring the historical inaccuracies the movie is disjointed a highlight reel put together by a lessthanpromising apprentice  the cinematography is good the acting is good but the storytelling is lacking
Nov 29 2023,negative,well a film of the good bad and funny for me   the battle scenes and choreography were superb in sections but surely more detail was required for napoleons battle genius to shine through the score was also rather epic and that im afraid is where the good ends    the bad includes the fact that the director has tried to cover too much and therefore succeeds in not developing any of the parallel story lines in any worthwhile detail and considering the length of the film that is difficult to achieve  i left trying to work out what type of film this actually wasa historical action epic a love story or a comedywhich brings me to my last point    there are just too many scenes where bonapartes character is actually ridiculed and he becomes a slapstick parody of himself perhaps scott is paying some type of homage to jacques tati    several scenes are just ludicrous where we cannot fathom how our protagonist morphs from charlie chaplin to emperor of france    i was really looking forward to this film what a disappointment
Nov 29 2023,positive,the movie was an excellent summary of some of napoleons history  we enjoyed it
Nov 29 2023,positive,the plot is not really surprising uses like so many napoleón stories his letter exchange with josefine the battle scenes are a must see bonapartes contribution to our modern world  the code napoleon  is missing the last shot with the info about the deaths caused by napoleon does not make any sense in a nutshell quite entertaining and a stellar performance by vanessa kirby
Nov 29 2023,negative,this was not an imax movie  wasted my money on imax ticket  i could have gotten the same effects on my big screen tv  probably a good amazon prime movie
Nov 29 2023,negative,went in with high hopes came out disappointed  first the positive  the battle scenes and visuals were well done  that said the script and character development were terrible  not sure why but napoleon is painted as a coward and fool which couldnt be further from the truth  wait for it on apple tv and skip all but the battles
Nov 29 2023,positive,boring and an hour too long
Nov 29 2023,positive,overall not a bad ridley scott take on a biopic  similar to scotts kingdom of heaven there are enough historical inaccuracies to distract and make the biopic seem more of a hollywood fiction  the focus on josephine took too much of the movie killed the pacing and could have been cut by half at least
Nov 29 2023,negative,joaquin phoenix is fantastic but his portrayal in this one just didnt pass  movie was needlessly too long no flow bounced all over the place and focused on his weird sexual oddities rather than the military strategy  by the end you are wondering what the point was and frankly felt like a waste of 3 hours with previews  shame because there was so much potential
Nov 29 2023,negative,tone is all over the place questionable writing and editing decisions abound no chemistry between the leads good costumes
Nov 29 2023,negative,a travesty against history moviegoers and napoleon
Nov 29 2023,negative,slow paced many characters few were identified not a stellar performance from joachim phoenix he seemed  bored with the whole thing the depiction of waterloo did not resemble the real thing
Nov 29 2023,negative,i considered not piling on here but since i had such high expectations for this film i will the audience it seems is meant to take for granted that napoleon was a charismatic brilliant leader because that is not on display in joaquin phoenix portrayalhe presents napoloeon as a pathetic grasping socially and romantically incompetent bozo the dialog was stilted and forced the editing of grand battle scenes choppy and confusing the movie seems to also take for granted that the audience understands the historical and strategic context of each battle and so takes little pain to reorient us as to where we are and why we care i feel bad for vanessa kirby josephine who seems to do the most with the scenes shes given but is she a manipulative temptress grasping for power or a sincere loving but fallible wife trying to survive tumultuous regime change the film doesnt help me understand i will have to google it lastly i dont think there is a single word of french spoken in this film i get why british director maybe didnt want to subtitle the main dialog for english speaking target audience but some french to lend some authenticity to the scenes would have been nice better yet cast a frenchman instead of phoenix and solve two serious problems at once
Nov 29 2023,negative,how can you make napoleons life one of the most interesting people in human history boring i thought it couldnt be done but ridley scott managed to make a revisionist boring unfocused mess that basically ignores every interesting thing or good thing about napoleon and just straight up makes stuff up a british person from the 19th century couldnt have made a better propaganda movie there is not a single place where i could call this film passable perhaps the very limited fight scenes at least look ok and still make no sense historically dont worry overall i would only recomend watching under the threat of death  watch waterloo instead peace
Nov 29 2023,negative,usually i like j phoenix and certainly ridley scott has made some incredible films but apart from a few visually beautiful scenes i found the movie to be flat  i was particularly distracted by phoenixs heavy dull american accent most of us yanks have far more inflection really esp when surrounded by mostly brit and french accents while im sure this was done on purpose it didnt work the historical inaccuracies didnt bother me as much as the overall flatness of the film i was squirming in my seat after the first hour and the lack of skilled editing came off as selfindulgent sorry  wanted to like it
Nov 29 2023,positive,loved the love story
Nov 29 2023,positive,ridley still knows how to film amazing battle sequences theres so many canons horses muskets and swords with fantastic sound and tons and tons of extras that make so many of these battles look legit the sets and costumes and everything else that goes into the production are unbelievably good    the thing i think i liked even more than the battle sequences was the complicated relationship between napoleon and josephine what is going on there they love each other but they both want to have power and control over oneanother they both cheat but are jealous at the idea of the other being with anyone else theres some great chemistry between these two actors and i wish i could see more of this wildly intriguing and complex relationship    the difficult part of this film is that it covers almost 30 years of time only a handful of battles are shown as we see napoleons rise and fall over this duration there are some obvious holes which i suppose is why the directors cut will be a necessary watch    overall i enjoyed the performance of phoenix as napoleon hes confident and very smart politically and a bit goofy when in private with those close to him i laughed more than i expected which i think helps with a break from the mass casualties that are shown when he is at war    now i need to find some good books and documentaries
Nov 29 2023,positive,if ridley scott could have his own waterloo this would be it horrible editing ineffective acting by phoenix
Nov 29 2023,negative,boring and disjointed touched on way to many eventstopics to do justice to any
Nov 29 2023,negative,costumes and photography are acceptable but this movie has an extremely boring storyline  its  literally  2h40m of pure dullness  with a few lame jokes inaccurate historical facts unexciting battle scenes and very pathetic romance 
Nov 29 2023,neutral,great visuals and soundtrack however the story is quite disappointing    for a film about a historic figure it seems more interested in several frivolous scenes about his dull romance with josephine    uncertain if this was intended for viewer retention in which event it failed even that    napoleon is very interested in telling a story about what it thinks the modern audience wants to see about a historic figure and in that it does a good job that is not however a compliment    it treats the enormous historical events and what lead to them with a blasé attitude being far more interested in showing the next sexual interaction between napoleon and his wife    in fact it feels a bit like a romcom that tries to be a historic drama    worth your money if you want to burn an hour or two but dont expect anything too interesting
Nov 29 2023,negative,way too much josephine    little context provided to the historical flow   the battle scenes were impressive but lacked historical accuracy napolean part of a cavalry charge at waterloo   no sir
Nov 29 2023,positive,amazing costumes sets surprisingly funny well paced
Nov 29 2023,positive,disappointed thought this would be a movie about napoleons military exploits turned into a plodding story about his romance with josephine guess it would have been ok if knew that coming in 
Nov 29 2023,negative,this movie should have been titled napoleon and josephine not the true history of napoleon very disappointing
Nov 29 2023,negative,this was not the movie that i was hoping for  first off if you have no prior knowledge about nepoleon or the french revolution then you will be lost right from the get go  history geeks might dig it but not the majority of the audience  i do know that neopleon was a brilliant strategist in his early years but lost his luster later in his career  i was hoping to see more of the brilliance depicted in the early battles and how his perception and tactics on the battlefield changed later in his campaigns  this movie didnt focus on this but rather nepoleons deranged psyche and dysfunctional relationships  saw this film on thanksgiving with the family and we all wished that we would have seen hunger games instead
Nov 29 2023,positive,there were a couple of things that were inaccurate shooting the tops off the pyramids for one wed wonder if he was as possessed with josephine as the movie made out since she seemed to not share that same feeling it was a good movie and we enjoyed it
Nov 29 2023,positive,great period piece joaquin phoenix is superb as napoleon a bit long and kind of slow moving at parts for dramatic effect
Nov 29 2023,positive,i thought that joaquin phoenix did a great job capturing the nuance of a very complicated man history will show napoleon to be a narcissistic yet insecure little man whose ego was responsible for millions of french soldiers losing their lives overall it was a long and meandering movie with some interesting spots but the movie that i attended malfunctioned in the last 15 minutes or so and the screen went black for about 15 mins after complaining the movie reappeared but there is no way of knowing how much i missed before the final scene in exile on st helana island overall i would recommend but i have seen better historic blockbusters which is what this was supposed to be
Nov 29 2023,positive,was very good  got just a bit long about halfway thru but thoroughly enjoyed
Nov 29 2023,negative,bad story telling half of the movie is romance and sex with josephine the plot bores me so much stuff from napoleons career empire managing conquests and his achievements are missing instead of trying to squeeze that into a 2 hr film focus on a particular event or campaign on napoleon or make two more movies i love joaquin phoenix but his portrayal of napoleon bonaparte is laughably bad wheres the charisma theres a reason he was beloved by his army and the french people at the time the battle scenes are visually nice but very historically inaccurate usually i dont mind some historical inaccuracies but the movies story telling is so bad and there were too many historical errors that i cant like this film  huge disappointment as i was looking forward to this film for a long time
Nov 29 2023,neutral,i felt like i was watching some instagrams reels
Nov 29 2023,neutral,it was boring at times and some of the scenes were unnecessarily over the top
Nov 29 2023,negative,i dont know where mr ridkey scott search for his story but absolutely not in history book i know you have seen so many comment like mine but really this movie is not about napoléon and josephine he created some full new characters i dont know how to say it  its not about napoleon its a movie on a man crying stupid jealous everything like the england propaganda wanted the word think of him the movie is beautiful nice light nice color nice battle maybe not ridley turn austerlitz like a simple front to front battle and took off of the strategy to napeleon im not really sad for the movie i think ridley really wanted to make joke about napeleon josephine french in general not a big surprise for an american and an english descendant
Nov 29 2023,neutral,my wife liked the movie i didnt i found it hard to follow who was fighting who and why  didnt  ever get a feel for napoleons character
Nov 29 2023,negative,i guess if you were a history nut you would appreciate this movie  it was very hard to follow and made little sense
Nov 29 2023,negative,way too much chick flick and movie tried to cover way too much chaotic at times poorly edited
Nov 29 2023,positive,not going to lie i wasnt expecting a lot whyd the rt scores as they are i really loved it though i thought it was so good not slow at all and the acting was great for the most part joaquin was amazing as usual i liked it much more than i expected im far from a history buff so wasnt harshly critiquing but i just really enjoyed it
Nov 29 2023,positive,masterpiece loved it
Nov 29 2023,positive,great movie shows the softer side of the great general great scenery and great action 
Nov 29 2023,positive,interesting movie not great but also not bad
Nov 29 2023,negative,disappointing ridley scott you had a chance to make a great rewatchable movie  his love story with josephine takes half of the movie  battles are only a few and very tiny compared to the actual sizes of battlefields 200 years ago  he cared a lot about exploring lots of thing we know about egypt we know from his expedition he brought scientists with him he didns shoot at the pyramids   black nobles in france in 1800 in that movie come on  no mention of his great marshals or the old guard  his greatness just isnt shown
Nov 29 2023,positive,another classic from ridley scott an enjoyable depiction of the historic french figure  the reviews do not do it justice i recommend to see this film
Nov 29 2023,neutral,napoleon is portrayed as a sexaddled buffoon in this movie  the movie is a great example of the adage that history belongs to the victors it would seem ridley scott was personally affronted by napoleon
Nov 29 2023,negative,do yourself a favour and avoid that movie do not trust the trailer and ads which promise an epic story and complex character development except for intense but messy war scenes beautiful costumes and decors this movie is a bore to watch and an insult to history   historically inaccurate and overly british biased the whole story build up if you can call that a build up is to lead to the lost waterloo battle and napoleon exile to depict british as superior   the storyline is rushed and grotesque scotts uses every opportunity to mock the french culture and get basic things wrong the birthday of napoleon itself while omitting the mans achievements beyond battles    it disregards most sides of that complex character to solely depict him as a lucky and ambitious sexual addict with personality disorder    there is no emotion at any moment the whole story development is flat and outrageously biased by  scotts obvious intention to diminish napoleons character    a poor cast a 47 year old actor to play a officer in his twenties rising to become the last emperor europe has seen and an overly represented british cast to play key french historical figures do not make the cut    if you like cinema if you like history if you like having a good time when watching movies do yourself a favour and invest 3h in doing anything else but watching this film
Nov 29 2023,positive,i would say ridley scott did a great no excellent job of making this movie
Nov 29 2023,negative,only thing good about the move was its battle scenes
Nov 29 2023,positive,great battle scenes  not much depth in story line but history can be that way
Nov 29 2023,positive,this is an educational but largely soulless movie  it came across as feeling very sterile  there is an interesting conundrum where the movie is largely about the deep and undying love between napoleon and josephine  and yet they show absolutely no signs of caring for each other and have no chemistry together in the scenes   i definitely learned about some history i hadnt known aboutconsidered before  but the movie was overly long and just not terribly engaging
Nov 29 2023,negative,just the biggest egg and disappointment from scott  and to hear him lash out at critics for taking him to task for historical inaccuracies is sad   everyone cant produce at a high level all the time and this is scotts waterloo   so much wrong here  lesson that scott has still not learned  no one tackles a historical subject as well known and revered as napoleon and gets to play loose with the truth     but that is only one of the multiple failings of this boring film a complete disaster and insult to the best military strategist to ever live churchill had a bust of napoleon on his desk scott just has a bust
Nov 29 2023,positive,the film was too long i did noty like all the depictions of horse mutilations i know it was war but i did not need to see that
Nov 29 2023,negative,aside from the great care taken in the costumes the film is a jumble of events that follow one another in time and space at the speed of light
Nov 29 2023,negative,joaquin phoenix was great movie was slow at time sex scenes was gross
Nov 29 2023,negative,the movie sparked high expectations when it got teased a few years ago but it was sadly too good to be true  from historical mistakes to bad written dialogue the only thing that was ok was the music and a few shots were nicely filmed but thats about it    a movie with this budget and such a bad outcome there are films of the napoleonic time made in 1970 with not even a tenth of this budget who are so much better the movie had no good cohesion the structure of the movie was not there jumping from one time to another and the big battles that they wanted to show were based on a quick cgi dump    i have the feeling that the direction house wanted a modern epic war movie but in a regency theme and that doesnt work sniper riffles trenches the ignorance of historical facts not even talking about wrong dates mentionned clothes places used just hurt to look atand thats the saddest part trying to convince the public of what this movie wasnt slighty a comedy nor a good biopic as the text descripes    the casting of joaquin phoenix was the biggest mistake it didnt feel rightit didnt click a charismatic intelligent man who was played by a way too old man who felt awkward the whole time like a 5 year old who just had tantrums i sense a bit old fashioned british pride and hate    the memoires and sources are here from paintings to books please please please use them as they are even more exciting as the dramatic scenes in the movie sadly they put all the money and time in cgi not in hireing a few people to give some historic feedback    besides the historical mistakes i cant enjoy the movie itself as i said the dialogue and acting was very low vanessa kirby proved she could act well even putting the historic mistakes aside you can tell but i cant say this about joaquin sadly we had different expectations after his amazing performance in the joker the music was fine added something to it the action scenes were ok its just like any marvel movie there is just so many things happening with screaming cgi and music so it looks cool wouldnt recommend anyone to pay for this tho
Nov 29 2023,positive,while not  a napoleon scholar i have read quite a bit about him  the film seemed rushed throughout and i am hoping that is remedied with the directors cut  unlike a lot of critics i really liked joaquin phoenix in the role  criticism aside i enjoyed the film having waited so long for it and am looking forward to the extended versions
Nov 29 2023,negative,one of the greatest generals in history and they make this horrible movie with no story the movie is called napoleon and half of the time its about his wife if i wanted to see a soap opera i would have gone to a different movie the dialog was horrible scenes made no sense they jumped from scene to scene only 2 battle scenes and they were atrocious
Nov 29 2023,positive,in my opinion this movie is just perfect vive la france
Nov 29 2023,positive,historicalfictional epic that is anything but celebratory of the iconic french general and emperor napoleon this colossal although imperfect and devoid of authenticintense pathos is very interesting   interesting and daring not only for the allegorical portrayal of its protagonist as well as the tormented and turbulent psychicsentimental bond between him and his wife josephine who is in himself egotistic narcissistic and with boundless ambitions but also for the fascinating and captivating aesthetics that the same grandiloquent film offers in terms of spectacle and entertainment   the work focused above all on the human aspect and not on the purely historiographicalhagiographic one hence the useless accusations against the film of lack of honestyhistorical fidelity and of little truthfulness in this sense downsizes the canonical portrait of napoleon bonaparte   the 85yearold ridley scott and his screenwriter david scarpa present us the controversial french leader and conqueror in his interiority showing his weaknesses shortcomings and dark areas   napoleon is as victorious in battle as he is fragile and full of vices and defects in his private life at the center of the film are the man rather than the historical figure the limits and weaknesses of a demystified character victim of his own idea of greatness and of his dominant and dominated ego at the same time brilliant strategist but also politician with little intuition husband in love but also possessive emperor of peace but also tyrant authoritarian   describing or redesigning such a multifaceted nuanced and at times contradictory character was no easy task and ridley scott only partially succeeds   authorial freedoms and daring poetic licenses despite very successful narrativeintrospective aspects unfortunately give life to a work which is in itself unequal unbalanced the tone oscillates too much between satire antiepic and grotesque vein and ultimately from the breath short   the spectacular and breathtaking dimension of the vision due to the superlative contribution of the direction of the entire technical sector    from the sets to the costumes through makeup cgi and photography    and the sumptuous aesthetic style that makes the film resemble many paintings of the time of battles and wars alternates with more intimate and private moments of napoleons life the dark joaquin phoenix was excellent but also the intense vanessa kirby  the true driving force of the plot and bonapartes actions not entirely completed and indepth   napoleon therefore has its greatest strength in the magnificent and compelling war sequences choreographed with mastery of rhythm and shots however as a whole the film is not entirely successful effective or wellresearched both in the approach to the setting and above all in the structure and writing of the screenplay   also disadvantaged by a running time of less than three hours the directors cut of over four hours will arrive on apple tv the film tries to cover 30 years of very dense and complex history but here however it suffers from excessive condensation sharp cuts omitted and essentially superficial and disconnected these defects which despite the fluid and smooth editing penalize the whole thing a bit reduce the amount of essential informationexplanations and compromise the quality analysis and general evaluation   in conclusion ridley scotts latest film despite some basic imperfections remains very dignified impressive and interesting and deserves viewing above all thanks to its sumptuous aesthetics as well as for the unprecedented portrait it paints of the rise and fall of its historical protagonist within a specific authorial conceptual perspective score in tenths 6  7
Nov 29 2023,negative,if he wanted to make a romance drama he couldve just said that instead of getting us hyped for a chronicle of the greatest military strategist of all time there is barely any of the war scenes promised i genuinely couldnt wait for it to finish
Nov 29 2023,negative,biggest disappointment this year  no jena no auerstedt no kutusov no war of the sixt coalition and much more   this movie should be calld josephine and not napoleon they are spitting on napoleon this movie is worse than kingdom of heaven or 1492 far worst   if you are intrested in a movie about napoleon than pls watch waterloo from 1970
Nov 29 2023,positive,all these eloquent low ratings im so glad i didnt listen to them its a great movie not the outcomes you want as they are based on history not some marvel writers imagination on shrooms its a story line spread across many years not over the timeline of a single summer so of coarse it feels like its leaping forward nonetheless joaquin was a pleasant company to have for 25 hours
Nov 29 2023,negative,what exactly this movie is about dont even ask yourself this question youll find no answers
Nov 29 2023,negative,its so bad that i find myself thinking that 1983 blackadders portrayal of napoléon is more credible
Nov 29 2023,negative,i dont understand this movie it has very little to do with history and who would come up with something so strange the film is not suitable for showing to anyone
Nov 29 2023,positive,would recommend it a phenomenal movie start to finish
Nov 29 2023,negative,ridley needs to stop with these boring disorganized autobiographical dramas and finish off the alien andor blade runner series
Nov 29 2023,positive,if you love huge epic loud gory war scenes this movie is for you very little actual character development the film assumes the viewer knows at least a few basic things about the life of bonaparte joaquin did the best he could given the limited scope of the film
Nov 29 2023,negative,unhistorical bad written and with a great cast forced to have the same facial expression for the entire movie i save only the costumes
Nov 29 2023,positive,movie was made by english first won war in the dark last was lost  that movie is too fast to explain a life like that
Nov 29 2023,negative,it is the worst comedy i have seen the director wipe his ass with history and edition
Nov 29 2023,positive,see it in imax its a fabulous movie remember that having a million followers on instagram or whatever does not mean you know a good movie when you see it you may not like it or appreciate it but that doesnt mean its not good everyone is a critic so just be entertained
Nov 29 2023,positive,average acting music forgettable too much battle scenes poorly written haphazard story lines hard to follow not very enjoyable
Nov 29 2023,positive,it is clear the movie had the budget choreography talent and skills i did find myself invested in the movie but as progresseion occured issues popped up the pacing and storyline development were too haphazard and missing key points of the story napoleons entire historical life line should of focused more on the key aspects instead of cramming decades into scenes that didnt feel relevant
Nov 29 2023,neutral,great battle scenes but overall the movie dragged no story arc felt like a series of vignettes performances are superb
Nov 29 2023,positive,the end was a little abrupt other than that 45 stars
Nov 29 2023,negative,horrendously bad  the directors utter contempt for his subject and his audience seem to be equally matched throughout the film it was an appalling hack job with no character development or story arc and no coherence
Nov 29 2023,positive,directing ridley scott is amazing
Nov 29 2023,positive,entertaining great depiction of napoleon and the history surrounding his rise and fall
Nov 29 2023,positive,joaquin phoenix and ridley scott reunited    it is finally here and i have finally seen it the new ridley scott movie the new joaquin phoenix movie obviously i was excited because of those 2 names being attached to this project then i saw the ratings and ill admit i was worried i mean everytime i watched the trailer for this movie i kept thinking maybe this will be a 35 star movie and i was right does that mean this is a bad movie absolutely not there is so many positives with this movie obviously the performances vanessa kirby giving her best performance oscar nomination for her as well as joaquin phoenix the man is so talented such an actor the cinematography in this movie was gorgeous absolutely gorgeous the fight scenes wow just wow amazing so so so good some of the issues i did have with this movie however was the score and music used in this film while at times the score was great in some scenes it just didnt fit same with some of that classical music pieces just didnt fit the scene there is a lot in this film like it spans over a long time and you gotta remember as much as you can particularly just people and their roles but overall a really good movie that i do recommend you guys go see but dont expect perfection
Nov 29 2023,neutral,very disappointing  i normally like ridley scott movies but this was one of his worst  so terribly disjointed  no good story telling it just seemed like a series of events  like a boring history lesson and then this happened and next this happened and then this happened etc with no relation of the import of it all  no telling of why one aspect of his life interrelated to any other  only th great acting of vanessa kirby kept me  interested and even then she was underutilized  i would not see this film a second time
Nov 29 2023,positive,battle scenes were good
Nov 29 2023,negative,boring way too much josephine way too long why the unessesary sex scene could have been a tight coherent 2 hour movie a lot of the josephine stuff could have been edited out could have given more historical explanation dont waste your money
Nov 29 2023,positive,very realistic and true to history
Nov 29 2023,positive,do not be dissauded by all these negative comments  this is a spectacular production  acting cinematography music and script  this is a character study  it is not a faithful documentary  neither was gladiator or kingdom of heaven  well worth watching in imax  ridley scott is one of the premiere directors ever
Nov 29 2023,negative,nice costumes well designed batlle scenes not much else after that just alot of british accents in a french movie
Nov 29 2023,neutral,kinda drawn out but fight scenes were cool
Nov 29 2023,positive,i think i liked this a little more than the critics but i was not wowed by the movie either  the battle scenes were good  i wish there were more  the costumes and sets were freaking great and the score worked very well    i do wonder if napoleon was such a dweeb  im not educated enough on it to say for sure  i seems like scott didnt like him  apparently he has sex like a jack hammer    it was exciting at times but lacked passion sexiness you have vanessa kirby    some of it seemed silly at times      maybe this is scotts waterloo moment      kirby and phoenix were great together      the movie did feel hurried  maybe it is too big a story for one movie  maybe could of focused on a smaller part of his life    it was not a suspenseful film but it also was not boring
Nov 29 2023,positive,ridley scotts napoleon visual looks amazing but theres a lot of scenes that were edit out on the movie and i almost slept in several scenes but im somewhat like it and meh but ive you apple tv wait for the 4 hour version
Nov 29 2023,positive,joaquin phoenix totally miscast in this role and the narrative is not very accurate historically that can bother some people that being said its an interesting screenplay despite the excessive and unnecessary violence in the film yet its very nice to look at if not a wee bit too long might take a second viewing to gain more of an appreciation of it as a whole but who has time for that until it comes out on appletvdvd would be interesting to see whats on the cuttingroom floor as the romance didnt seem based on much that needed more depth and development vanessa kirby was very good she stole every scene from joaquin in truth he was no match for her literally
Nov 29 2023,negative,highly disappointing and exceptionally bad acting
Nov 29 2023,positive,i did not anticipate the level of bloody war scenes that were in this movie its napoleon what was i thinking
Nov 29 2023,positive,another dreadfully long movie j phoenix is a goofy napoleanperhaps he truly was  i am prompted to research the history of this period in french and european history   venessa kirby was stunning in her role and as in the crown netflix life was not kind to her character
Nov 29 2023,positive,pretty well done for the most parta little hard to follow at timeslots of history i guess the reason  kind of expected a french accent from the napoleon character but i guess that might have been a little hokey
Nov 29 2023,positive,it was pretty good hard to do his whole life but it was pretty solid
Nov 29 2023,negative,the costuming was impressive as were some of the indoor settings and we enjoyed hearing bits of classical music in some of the scenes however the movie in general was slow and somewhat boring the battle scenes were not boring but there were too many of those     joaquin phoenix did a great job playing napoleon the odd relationship between him and his wife did not create a great sense of empathy for their plight we expected more from this movie its too bad that a prominent figure such as napoleon was not characterized in a more dramatic or interesting fashion
Nov 29 2023,positive,as a napoleon fan i came into this movie with high expectations and was disappointed dont get me wrong the acting was great drifting was great action was great and for the most part the wringing was decent my biggest complaint was that way too much screen time was given to josephine when i say she had as much screen time as napoleon im not joking the movie shouldve instead focused on napoleons military battles and him running france the best scenes in the movie by far were the military scenes and if the movie focused on that instead of josephine the movie wouldve improved greatly to put it into perspective there were seven collations the movie only showed three  i know im going on a bit of a tangent but to make a long story short napoleon was good at two things knowing how to run a country and knowing how to run a battlefield instead of focusing on that the movie focoused on napoleons inability to run a relationship
Nov 29 2023,positive,acoustics were very loud in the theater
Nov 29 2023,positive,brilliant performances by joaquin phoenix and vanessa kirby ridley scott manages to compress many important events and battles into the story that he needs to tell napoleons brutish and often sadistic behavior towards josephine was harder for me to watch than some of the battle scenes the cinematography was astounding grand tableau and the costumes of the soldiers from different countries are oscar worthy  the move runs longer 238 but i felt like everything in the film was necessary
Nov 29 2023,negative,focused too much on relationship with josephine historic inaccuracies not enough battles didnt show his great abilities with battles and hard to make him a charismatic leader with soldiers
Nov 29 2023,positive,i didnt know much about napoleo so i found it very interesting i wasnt quite sure what to think of him even at the end but the show had both action and drama i would recommend seeing this one 
Nov 29 2023,positive,slow and at times confusing
Nov 29 2023,negative,im a big fan of ridley scott that is why i am a bit confused how this film was put forth with such an incomplete and fragmented storyline however what i really think it is is that the film was probably severely cut due to runtime anxiety ive seen this before where a movie is cut up so much for theater viewing that the longer later realeased uncut version is a way better movie and a completely different organism a great example of this is oliver stones alexander theatrical cut and alexander revisited revisited was about 30 minutes longer but boy was it a way better and more complete film i think that is the truest approach to take with gigantic characters like alexander and napoleon directors should not be afraid of runtime and design the movie to have an intermission
Nov 29 2023,positive,best movie that came out in 2023
Nov 29 2023,negative,the writing acting and directing have all been thoroughly and justly roasted in other reviews of this movie  but im going to point out another element also incompetent that should have defined the movie to a large degree the battle sequences  none of them are in any way exciting to watch  none of them convey any of the suspense and complexity of strategy that made them some of the most highly dangerous as well as famous battles in history  read even the mostcursory narrative of the battle of austerlitz and you realize that the battle depicted in this movie is merely the very tail end of an arduous daylong slugfest during which the french having yielded the pratzen heights to the russoaustrian enemies made them extend their lines and then retook those heights only then did napoleon who had just recently reached those heights unleash cannons onto the frozen meres  the battle of borodino one of the longest and bloodiest battles of napoleons career is instead relegated to a few slow shots of the french and russians frontally charging each other completely failing to show the autonomous armies within an army corps system that made napoleonic warfare so revolutionary and that made many of napoleons battles a series of simultaneous smaller battles  the movies depiction of these battles is not dramatic license  it is an idiotic ignorance of how to portray history in a cinematically compelling way
Nov 29 2023,negative,rename the title to josephine and it would be a masterpiece if the movie was advertised as josephines account of her relationship with napoleon it would explain why she left out crucial parts of napoleons brilliant career and the several historical inaccuracies throughout that way you could appreciate ridley scotts movie for what it is a fictional love story that briefly mentions some of napoleons feats
Nov 29 2023,positive,wonderful historical references and overview
Nov 29 2023,negative,this is enormously expensive evidence of the type of rotten dud that results from an awful script a lead actor ill adapted to his part and a director with zero selfawareness and very little dramatic sense
Nov 29 2023,positive,i like the historical events that is not talk or written about much it seems napoleon was kind of hidden about his event s in history  i think the film was very well done for that period time  enjoyed the movie about this little french general 
Nov 29 2023,positive,this is a very good movie with an excellent acting and it follows history however it is graphic at times which isnt necessary
Nov 29 2023,negative,poor script as it shows a weak napoleon which is far from the truth napoleons legal educational and financial systems are in place in france and other countries to this day bonaparte a inovator in artillery tactics fought 61 battles and only lost six of them the movie doesnt mention any of this
Nov 29 2023,negative,it drag out bag acting
Nov 29 2023,negative,this movie was truly abysmal very long and very boring a catastrophe on the scale of napoleons invasion of russia
Nov 29 2023,negative,this movie is far from what could be expected from its name napoleon its a vague historical context with unnecessary details of his private life that are not yet proven i personally disagree with the way they portrait his autism since it needs a context rather than making napoleon seem a person with serious mental problems specially in communication the battles won by napoleon lost relevance against the one he failed against britain     very biased plot and definitely nothing good about it dont waste your money
Nov 28 2023,negative,one of the worst movies ive ever seen the only goal of the film was to ridicule napoleon it seems to be written by the british satire in 1815    ridiculous pathetic unfunny nonsense even the sex and battle scenes are worthless    avoid like the plague
Nov 28 2023,negative,such a shame napoleon directed by a person who didnt want to understand the period or the man played by an actor who didnt seem to know who he was playing  a film so far from reality that it only seems to borrow names for this work of fiction  read memoires about the real historical figures for their stories or so powerfull and pure that it will leave you wondering how this all could be true  i hope you will then find that the lives of those important historical figures are so much more complex and interesting than some story writer could ever make them    spare yourself and go watch an other movie
Nov 28 2023,neutral,an enjoyable movie to watch once yet far from the epics created by ridley scott in the past in three hours of film the plot cant make up its mind between an indepth portrayal of napoleons relationship with josephine a detailed look into his rise to power or his conquests and fall as emperor and therefore only scrapes the surface of each hitting none well enough to give emotional connection to any part of the film or characters or stir any intensity to the scenes occasional spots of humour are dropped into some scenes and feel somewhat out of place the speed and briefness of the plot denies the viewer any real scope in the extent of napoleons life achievements and failures     while the battle scenes in their brief format are interesting and occasionally dramatic they are somewhat painful to watch as scott cuts out the more interesting tactical struggles of key napoleonic battles and replaces them with quick and mindless battle charges as if all sides were tactless barbarians leaving the viewer confused as to how and why each conflict concluded     the pompous loud and uncharasmatic portrayal of lord wellington is also extremely questionable missing the mark on an extremely tactile shy yet charming individual
Nov 28 2023,positive,too much war action
Nov 28 2023,positive,very focussed on his life with josephine which seems to be the biggest issue war movie fans are having  a bit disjointed but keen to see what the full 4 hour cut contains in a world where people get bored very quickly i can understand chopping out and trimming stuff to keep it shorter  certainly not uo there with gladiator  doesnt surprise me at all that youtube historians and french are tearing it to pieces entirely predictable but doesnt make it an entertaining artistic  brave take on the man
Nov 28 2023,positive,    a victory in scenery and performance but lacking the firepower in pacing    the film is a raw depiction of napolonic france with all the ambience pomp and grit of the era napoleon takes center stage and through his footsteps we see the cannon sound onto the screen in a grand mixture of practical and believable cgi creating that mud of war we also see the troubling personal strife for an heir in his devoted love for dear josephine all these parts feel real of the emotion and ego to ascend the ambitions for his beloved country      but the overall story lacks a gradual build up and feels like a bullet pointed history lessons understandably he left a large legacy but at times these jump between historical nuggets that could be interluded with ad breaks like a documentary on national geographic also this made for masses stamp leads to a fully englished dialogue with only snippets of french influence  this made sense to me in films like the parodydeath of stalin  but felt wrong in an autobiographical peice    i found this disjointed pacing distracting and think attempted too much in encapsulating such a large life rather than focused on a fixed period in his time however for its captivating scale and portrayal i cannot rate this film lower than 710
Nov 28 2023,negative,gave me the impression that i was watching a behind the scene documentary poor acting boring story
Nov 28 2023,negative,i was so disappointed with this film when i heard this was a ridley scott film with joaquin phoenix playing napoleon i thought this film was going to be the best film of the year it wasnt it was terrible really really terrible the little mistakes and inaccuracies for example the elite did not speak with their servants servants werent even supposed to be seen they did not casually wait for visitors on the door or use plastic glasses to drink wine which was obvious when the actors chinked glasses marriage was synonymous with business deals so marriage at 15 was socially acceptable despite the fact they were weaving a story about napoleon they  made him appear really dull and a little pathetic which when considering the subject matter should be nigh on impossible he was most like a psychopath with his grandiose view of himself and his propensity for violence he was also incredibly ambitious and clever do you think his relationship with josephine would be just a bit more interesting than i really love her   and when a man is vigorously washing his hands for crying out loud dont film from behind
Nov 28 2023,negative,too ridiculously anglocentric and it is absurd to watch a movie of a memorable french foe of the british empire in english
Nov 28 2023,negative,this movie felt like it was based on the cliffnotes on the rise and fall of napoleon with all the essential elements either forgotten changed or misinterpreted   if you want to write your own story and not convey actual historical facts then i would suggest maybe making fictional films instead
Nov 28 2023,negative,i watched this at the movies last weekend what a disappointment  i fail to understand who allowed this to pass into production the story is inconsistent there is a lovearch which isnt believable and the portrayal of napoleon is so poor that it hurts the great battle scenes and fantastic costumes are not enough to turn this into anything but a mediocre movie
Nov 28 2023,positive,slowseemed to drag out  the battle scenes were good
Nov 28 2023,negative,honestly the only thing that saves this movie is the odd action scene rest fella cobbled together at 2 and half hours the fact its that rushed ive no idea why they didnt do a 2 part of even 3 part biopic the portrait of napoleon as some daffy duck type angry cuckold is over the top you can tell phoneix is playing character exactly as directedwhich absolves him from any blamebut it comes across as weak and unconvincing as he was one of the greatest military minds of all time
Nov 28 2023,negative,the movie lacked an overarching story scenes were abruptly put together i wanted to know more about who napoleon was his motivations and more about what was happening in france i have more questions than answers i do like the casting i just believe it needed a writer to weave the story together best part was the last third i was waiting for the battle of waterloo unfortunately a blue filter was used the whole scene and i would have liked to have viewed what should have been a very colorful scene
Nov 28 2023,positive,ok but i was expecting something completely different
Nov 28 2023,negative,long boring and not very informative
Nov 28 2023,positive,if you love history then you will love this movie phoenix is incredible as napoleon 
Nov 28 2023,positive,we thoroughly enjoyed the movie and would like to know where it was filmed  more people in the theatre than weve seen for months
Nov 28 2023,positive,captivating storytelling and stunning visuals bring napoleons life to vivid life on screena mustsee for history buffs
Nov 28 2023,positive,the movie loses track of his first wifes two kids then you never see the son he had after he shows off the newborn  also it jumped around a lot  the special effects the drowning army and the battles were done quite well  and i absolutely love most anything vanessa kirby does
Nov 28 2023,negative,boring made napoleon look like a silly chump disjointed and focused on nonsense
Nov 28 2023,positive,i liked the storyline the overall acting and the battle scenes  this was very satisfying
Nov 28 2023,negative,visually impressive in parts rushed in others  this movie probably tried to do too much  and succeeded in nothing  the battle scenes were too few and too small to reflect the magnificent of napoleons military career  his charisma was almost non existent reminded me of the man who wasnt there in parts and would have you believe napoleon became emperor just by standing around  for a better portrayal of napoleon go and watch waterloo for a better understanding of him go and watch any decent documentary  and if you want to understand the magnitude of his impact on history  just watch oversimplified on youtube
Nov 28 2023,positive,i thought it was a good biopic of napoleon joaquin phoenix brings true life to the character saw it today at the cinema really enjoyed it 
Nov 28 2023,positive,didnt explain all of the theft but was very enjoyable
Nov 28 2023,positive,acting was good not joaquin phoenixs best role however
Nov 28 2023,negative,it could have been something great which is frustrating it neither focused on the personal nor the military carreer it was tremendously underwhelming
Nov 28 2023,negative,a grossly insulting pathetic portrayal of napoleon in a disjointed story riddled with historical inaccuracies no man would have followed and been led by this version of napoleon from egypt to moscow a total mess
Nov 28 2023,negative,i e been looking forward to a movie on napoleon ever since i saw the reports on a project many years ago in which dustin hoffman was to play the title role i found this movie to lack any continuity and the relationship between napoleon and josephine to be one of the most forgettable relationships of all time there was no portrayal of feeling and the script was wooden and uninteresting many of the historical figures such as czar alexander came off as caricatures the lead character spent most time on screen with a silent stare or scowl a lot of money and effort expended for a poorly written script and mediocre acting
Nov 28 2023,negative,the movie has no dramatic power  it stretches itself thin and boxes itself into a corner  its riddled with uninspiring dialogue  joaquin phoenixs acting is terrible  vanessa kirby is a doeeyed weepy nonentity as josephine  its the fault of the producers who spent hundreds of millions of dollars on a project with an awful script and a director who has very evidently lost whatever touch he had if he ever had any  and i highly doubt he ever did 
Nov 28 2023,negative,its one thing for a film to be inaccurate and misleading in its depiction of history quite another to be utterly devoid of compelling drama this film is both  paul barras in reality a genuine rival and enemy of napoleon and one of napoleons fiercest opponents within france during his rise to power while being romantically involved with josephine prior to her involvement with napoleon is almost never shown as such while the lengthy maneuvering to get his plan for the recapture of toulon approved which required alliance with powerful officials separate from barras is never shown  napoleons early campaign in italy where he faced three powerful austrian armies defeated them all after ferocious fighting and in so doing really did save revolutionary france from destruction is never depicted  the battle of marengo when napoleon genuinely lost a battle and only had it regained due to the timely intervention of his lieutenant louis desaix killed in the battle is never depicted  his ordering of the arrest and execution of the duc denghien the french royal heir  one of the mostmomentous decisions in napoleons entire career  is never depicted  these are only the mostegregious errors in this muddled morass  the battles that are depicted are portrayed without any perception of the strategic maneuvering and adaptation that preceded and defined the battles themselves  in rushing to cover the entirety of napoleons career in a mere feature length the film descends into a muddled nonentity of noise blood and confusion  joaquin phoenixs atrocious performance is completely at variance with the real man napoleon was  rupert everett as the duke of wellington delivers the only competent performance in the entire film  and that in a supporting role
Nov 28 2023,negative,this film is a turkey  not just because all of ridley scotts films on french history have bombed or because brooding drugaddict playing mouthfilledwithgravel joaquin phoenix completely misplays the part of napoleon or because vanessa kirby is a mediumtalent actress playing a part way above her abilities  but because the script is very evidently horrible  ridleys editing of that script during production is itself evidence that its horrible and it was undoubtedly made more horrible due to the directors illadvised intervention  the proof is in the result  rather the lack of a cinematicquality result  this thanksgiving season im thankful that sergei bondarchuk h a l craig vittorio bonicelli  mario soldati and rod steiger had the skill and vision to bring a pitchperfect cinematic portrayal of napoleon to the big screen in waterloo which will stand all the taller in contrast to this hellacious piece of garbage
Nov 28 2023,positive,i enjoyed this film for what it was a fairly decent war film with good battle scenes i think it would have worked better in the french language instead of everyone speaking with a posh british accent apart from napoleon american also it should have been more historically accurate but thats hollywood worth a watch
Nov 28 2023,negative,it was a completely ahistorical emasculation of napoleon that was like eating mold to watch the pacing was weird and it just hopped jumped skipped and flipped through whatever napoleon did in his life or whatever happened to him but the extreme focus was on josephine and her supposed cucking of the man    complete letdown
Nov 28 2023,negative,to be certain there were rumblings very early on of this films poor quality  the terrible script jodie comers abrupt exit from the project after looking at the script the mere 28 days in production ridley scotts admission of heavy script rewriting during production  but i dont know if anyone quite fathomed how far joaquin phoenixs poor acting could send this film flying off the rails  in the fits and spurts when napoleon is actually starting to build some decent historical drama its literally all ruined as soon as joaquin opens his mouth or wheezes or grunts or keeps his mouth shut in the instances where more dialogue would have helped a scene  its not that hes an incompetent actor  its that hes so rigorously seriously broodingly playing the part of napoleon in an absolutely wrong utterly boring way  you really feel for the actors in the supporting and bit roles especially rupert everett as the duke of wellington who are doing their darndest with the relatively meager dialogue theyre given  unfortunately the comparisons are inevitable with oliver stones alexander and colin farrells weak performance in the titular role  high and mighty in the early 2000s ridley scott evidently failed to learn the harsh lesson from that film generally dont attempt entirecareer panoramic coverage of a famous military leader in a feature  oh how pride doth cause the mightiest of falls
Nov 28 2023,positive,a rip roaring fast pace epic from ridley scott yes it races through napoleons rich life story and focuses on some key battles and his tempestuous relationship with josephine but it is a terrific cinema experience which is thoroughly enjoyable and battle sequences are up to par with the best ever vive lemperor
Nov 28 2023,negative,a very odd film the trailer makes napoleon look like a grand leader the film itself makes him look like a weak and cowardly man beholden to his girlfriend with zero charisma then the end card says that a lot of people died and seems to suggest that its all his fault between this odd messaging and the time skipping this movie is a huge bait that ultimately wastes your time
Nov 28 2023,positive,very light on the political machinations that got him and then lost him the top job  heavy on the social trivia and frankly  when youve seen one battle scene you seen them all  its watchable enough but not worth going out of your way for  mind you it is probably better than some of the dreadful looking offerings on the trailers which preceded the film
Nov 28 2023,negative,to take such a rich history and create something so utterly tedious crude and uninspiring is truly a remarkable feat
Nov 28 2023,negative,what a waste of an opportunity scotts attempts shine in the battle but turn bmovie soft prn leaving the movie trying to prove itself or save money i get the angle of relationship he is attempting to express but no one cares about napoleons sex life much less want to see it over battle all of this can be told without papa smurf getting pervy every 10 minutes this is a movie for horny historians who have no love life absolutely no one wanted a movie about napoleon like this  my expectations for gladiator 2 just plummeted
Nov 28 2023,negative,spent way too much time on his relationship with his wife and not enough on really anything else
Nov 28 2023,negative,i think they should retitle the movie napoleon et son grand chapeau joachim phoenix grumps through the film with his hat largely in the same tempo and bad mood tempered occasionally by a hissy fit when the battles arent going well when he takes his temper out on his hat the battles are done well but are  well a bit boring there seemed to be little at stake even in the battles which i felt was also reflected in the love scenes very little sexual energy between josephine and her lover despite the constant bonking  it was a bit like watching a 1940s porn film i really am not sure what the film was about im none the wiser about how this man got to be emperor of france or even if he was a good  general or not was josephine a whore or a grand lady the film offers little information the film is also overlong and seems longer i couldnt wait for the battle of waterloo and we all know the outcome of that was the battle in the balance ive no idea i as most of the audience left feeling disappointed and sort of empty
Nov 28 2023,positive,this movie is certainly not a biopic it breezes through napoleons life with a fair amount of interpretation that seeks to convey a message about his character and historical legacy i thoroughly enjoyed this movie for what it was and will be seeing it again
Nov 28 2023,positive,well joaquin phoenix did a phenomenal job as usual hes one of the best in my opinion the movie moves through history with great haste which is a good and bad thing good because you see more snipits of his life and french history in length not so good because its a bit rushed and much is lost lets put it this way the movie could have been an hour longer it would have been better that way i can sit through a 4hour movie id actually be glad to the future is longer movies i am an avid moviegoer truly and when i see an hour 40 minute movie i think childrens movie this movie is not that this movie has substance and is not short good movies are longer good stories in life are longer character development character destruction emotional movement rise and fall ascension and dissension all take time  such is life in this movie his stoic face was my favorite part also the architecture costumes art cgi are all also topnotch this will be a movie people watch decades from now no doubt it was made with that intention moving forward such movies ought to be of great length people that love movies and appreciate this art form and the experience at the highest level can withstand 354 hours
Nov 28 2023,positive,nothing like watching a good biopic and not learning anything
Nov 28 2023,positive,ridley scott does a commendable job of telling the life of napoleon in a 2 hour and 30 minutes film to which in all reality the emperor of france deserves at least 3 season worth of television to explore the his life story
Nov 28 2023,negative,i was excited to see this movie after seeing the preview trailers  once the movie started i realized that this movie was a total flop i took 8 members of our family to see napolian  everyone came away disappointed
Nov 28 2023,negative,what a disastersuch a disappointment and by far ridley scotts worst movie in over 20 years not even mentioning the lack of historical accuracy and a huge list of factual lies and mistakes this movie manages to transform one of humanitys most wellknown conqueror into a pathetic emotional weakling
Nov 28 2023,negative,a waste of film i went with the lowest of expectations as the us is pretty horrible at making historically accurate movies and it was still underwhelming  cant really say that it was worth getting the imax experience either  the visuals are just not epicbeatifulletc enough for it    the entire movie is just an awkward list of main events in napoleons life with a few rough sex scenes in between    i like phoenix but not in this movie  he plays napoleon with same face and energy from the time napoleon is in his 20s to his 50s alexander who is suppose to be in his late 30s during his screen time is played by some kid barely out of teenage years turning battle of austerlitz into battle of lake peipus from the 13th century was rediculous  no halfgood comander wouldve repeated that fiasco fighting on ice the list of historical inaccuracies can go on for pages  a nearly 3 hour long cringe  on the up side this is one movie review my mother and i can agree on good job for bringing generations together  that is what that one star is for 
Nov 28 2023,negative,atrocious writing stiff acting terrible pacing and far too much focus on his sex life rather than his inedible career key moments in his story were turned into throwaway lines in exchange for uncomfortable and borderline pornographic scenes that feel like they were written by ai however it was rather historically accurate they just focused on the dumbest parts of history to focus on it gets an extra halfstar because some of the battle scenes were very good
Nov 28 2023,positive,the good  awesome visuals epic battle scenes and the costumes were perfect this is a visually stunning movie    the bad  so historically innaccurate they should have named it a different movie the tactics in the battle scenes look like viking charges albeit with cannons there were black french officersin 1805 the battle of austerlitz did not go like that borodino was glossed over and napoleon never led cavalry charges at waterloo    the ugly  joaquin phoenix plays napoleon like mr bean his portrayal of his is as a socially awkward bumbling fool with no personality his only interest seems to be in rutting with his cheating wife
Nov 28 2023,positive,i really enjoyed this i think that joaquin did a really good job telling this story if you are a history buff i think this would be something that you would really like it really shows just incredible and tragic events that happened and led to so much apart of the modern day history really incredible it also had its moments of making me laugh would recommend to see one time
Nov 28 2023,positive,the historical elements were interesting and the acting was good but the story dragged a bit
Nov 28 2023,negative,the worst movie of ridley scott and joaquin pheonix  i cant imagine the hatred that this film could have provoked in the french  napoleon is one of his greatest pride and in this film they make him look like a medieval joker  he does not adhere in any way to historical reality and the worst thing is the settled texan with whom joaquin speaks throughout the film  it really is a crappy movie
Nov 28 2023,negative,one of the worst movies ever made ridley scott has done the imaginable take the varied and interesting life of one of europes most prominent people and turn it into the dullest and most confusing film ever history buffs will find the lack of any historical accuracy excruciating non history buffs will find the story  characters flat and confusing everyone will find it extremely boring even the battles are terrible  while visually fine they make zero sense watch anything else
Nov 28 2023,positive,knowing something about napoleon i felt the movie was somewhat disjointed  it alternated between selected battle scenes and the relationship between napoleon and josephine  i could have done with more of the historic campaigns and less of napoleon and josephines unusual relationship  i felt some time was wasted constantly going back to scenes showing napoleon and josephine behaving strangely towards each other in their relationship  i felt that was established early on and did not have to be constantly revisited   i dont want to include any spoilers
Nov 28 2023,positive,i have no desire to rewatch phoenix was good in this the film felt long and the pacing was off decades are supposed to have pass but felt barely a few months the battles were excellent but i would have like to know the animosity between the french and british
Nov 28 2023,positive,great movie if a bit short but i guess if all of the wars were to be portrayed i would still be there watching loved how joaquin phoenix played napoleon
Nov 28 2023,negative,very boring movie shallow character development and endless fights without a story to them
Nov 28 2023,negative,this movie represents rhe tragic end of what used to be a great director
Nov 28 2023,positive,i dont think it clearly described napoleons prowess or lack there of as a military leader but focused more on his enduring infatuation with josephine i was left unclear whether he was historically a hero or villian
Nov 28 2023,positive,great experience and enjoying to watch but too many sex scenes
Nov 28 2023,negative,a miserable disappointing rotten stinker  how could it be visually spectacular  seemed it was 99 in black  white  left us in awe struggling to make out what we were looking at as everything was shrouded in darkness we had trouble discerning even what their facial expressions were and what they were wearing and why bother with the settings and background scenery if minimal light was ever cast  almost all was blackened silhouettes against a black background  disastrous  the only color was a very few scenes when dark red could be discerned am reminded of the moody blues classic as it seems the only lighting was a coldhearted orb that rules the night red is black and yellow white and we decide what is right and the entire movie was confusion and illusion  this movie style which is the rule these days not the exception would have ruined all the movies of the past which were bright and spectacular and colorful not dark and drab and washed out and colorless  why bother  and walking phoenix was entirely miscast  napoleon at least had some charisma but this one  had zero more of a spoof a buffoon a joker  and maybe the reason josephine couldnt get pregnant was that he was doing it all wrong as in all the love making scenes her back was turned to him if you know what i mean  not that theres anything wrong with that   we felt like walking out after the first half hour   thinking about giving up on hollywood movies as they have given up any regard for the audience  was really looking forward to this but it was rotten      saw it at amc lerton 112723
Nov 28 2023,negative,take a welldocumented and remarkable figure from the past make a movie about them that deliberately lies about or has no grasp of the historical facts portray them as a mediocre uninteresting sexual deviant and you have the steaming pile of dung that is napoleon
Nov 28 2023,positive,joaquim phoenix is a terrific actor imo but i didnt see this as one of his stellar roles his american accent seemed a bit out of place among others that sounded more european the film gives a good overview of napoleons role in history and the battles but could have included better accounting of frances resultant economic dilemma his other mistresses etc and historical foreshadowing of the napoleonic line of succession
Nov 28 2023,positive,not enough action and more of
Nov 28 2023,negative,phoenix always has me on the fence regarding his performances  loved him as cash  liked his joker  didnt care for this napolean  is it ridley scotts fault phoenixs someone else or just a poorly constructed narrative  i dont recommend this film and im probably the real problem   i was hoping for more of a biopic   this isnt one
Nov 28 2023,positive,it was alright had good scenes but as a whole it was mediocre
Nov 28 2023,negative,very poor character development nothing to connect you to napolean  not a believable character portrayal of someone who rose to become hero of france on merit then ultimately morphed into a tyrant who got carried away with his own hubris  poor story telling  just a superficial dip into key events  could have done so much more with this story and character and overall very underwhelming      if you want to be entertained by the story of napolean read young bloods by simon scarrow the first book in a four part series which is incredible
Nov 28 2023,negative,the story revolved for the most part about josephine the wife of napoleon the whole movie felt really shallow and the dialogue cheap the cgi looked as if it was done on a budget when the horse had its chest shot off it was so vague that it looked as if the rendering wasnt done properly waste of time and money this film
Nov 28 2023,negative,omg as soon as i saw it was done by apple i should have known but because it had an actor i liked in it i watched the film anyways it was long and boring i debated just grabbing my stuff and leaving
Nov 28 2023,negative,dreadful film no storyline jumped all over the place without any  explanation no effort at characterisation and terrible dialogue based on this film you come away asking how did a passive non entity like napoleon rise to rule france many critics say the best bits were the battle scenes and while the uniforms and cinematography was spectacular there was no attempt at conveying what a napoleonic battle was like ridley scott simply lined up a couple of hundred extras and told them to charge at each other absolutely nothing like a napoleonic battle  he turned austerlitz into a remake of saving private ryan and waterloo into a remake of 1917 with ww1 style trenches all over the place frightening how many people seem to think this captured the feel of a napolionic battle go watch the 1970s film waterloo for what it should look like and for rod stiegers performance as napoleon full of fire and passion
Nov 28 2023,neutral,meh  for as much as i love joaquin and ridley this one just did not work  it was too much to try and cram into 160 minutes  there was no time to develop characters  someone would finish a sentence and next thing you know the film would jump ahead ten years  the battle scenes were all wonderfully shot but this would have been better done as a four or five episode streaming series
Nov 28 2023,positive,fantastic battle scenes incredible sound and two actors that should be nominated for oscars  truly excellent film  forget all the history buffs this is entertainment   enjoyed so much we may go back again a must watch in a good cinema     just love this era so much and ridley  scott simply  nails it
Nov 28 2023,positive,disjointed is what comes to mind here great battle scenes but the inbetween stuff didnt capture and hold my attention
Nov 28 2023,positive,shockingly good may be one of the best warbattle depicting movies ever   great brief depiction of the revolution and the turmoil afterwards   also very welldone portrayal of bonaparte as he was by all accounts quirky  awkward   absolutely worth seeing in the theaters
Nov 28 2023,negative,if napoleon was as described by scott nobody wouldve followed him to the stroll in the park yet alone the war
Nov 28 2023,negative,truly truly sacrilege napoleon has been reduced to an emotionless whiny brat that cant function without his girlfriend josephine not an ounce of historical accuracy reduced one of the world iconic historical figures to a weak weak man ridley scott needs to have some shame for what he has done money wasted
Nov 28 2023,negative,its a spectacle to watch to be certain but a mess otherwise scotts decision to just ignore accents in a historical pic is perplexing love the french accent on prussian czar alexander and phoenixs decision to channel the anguish of brando screaming stella crossed with the marblemouthed pronunciations of someone from jersey shore got grating about 15 minutes into this 2 and a half hour movie great costumes terrific battle sequences otherwise yeesh and to the reviewers suggesting to watch waterloo instead good god thats the only movie about napoleon worse than this dog you must be joking 
Nov 28 2023,positive,extremely longer than it needed to be for what it was
Nov 28 2023,negative,ridley scott keeps making movies to show us how little he knows about history
Nov 28 2023,positive,historical information
Nov 28 2023,positive,ridley scotts battle scenes were impressive as one has come to expect from this director but the story line was tedious  difficult to go through an entire career within the confines of a 150minute movie  acting was of course wonderful but i found myself wanting the movie to be over at about the 90minute mark  i expected so much more from a scott movie
Nov 28 2023,positive,with stunning set pieces and an adequate lead performance by joaquin phoenix napoleon is a detailed and roughly painted account of napoleons life that unfortunately is plagued by some shallowness and downplay of genuine emotion that makes the journey not as compelling as it could have been
Nov 28 2023,negative,typical hollywood disaster the character of napoleon is portrayed as a sentimental freak who has in mind only his feelings over his actual career on top of that not only was the campaign of italy skipped and just so mentioned it didnt just surrender like nothing but it took some time for it to be completed but the only thing important of the campaign in egypt is a single cannonball shot on a pyramid and dont get me started on the unnecessary scenes about his private life who arent even that relevant to actual history screen time wasted on those scenes could have been used to go in more detail about historical events since thats what napoleon is remembered for but of course this is not what hollywood wants right a note to ridley scott stop spitting on history like this thank you
Nov 28 2023,positive,a great film it reminded me of the epic movies of years gone by massive action scenes a brilliant tragic love story historical drama and fabulous acting highly recommended
Nov 28 2023,negative,absolutely horrendous film the writing and the acting specifically from joaquin not josephine is absolutely horrid this isnt a film for anyone who likes history or even anyone who likes entertainment the best that could be said about this film is that its boring at its worst its just downright terrible in every sense of the word    ridley scott has been riding on the coat tails of previously good films in his legacy and its led to burning 200 million dollars on a guy who has an absolute level of disgust and disdain for the subject matter he made a film about for some reason
Nov 28 2023,positive,drags on a bit but has beautiful shots great acting and set design
Nov 28 2023,neutral,biggest disappointment of the year uncharismatic and uncommited phoenix wandering around the screen kirby is doing her job battles a parody utterly stupid nowhere near to great waterloo 1970 i appreciate only wonderful costumes and sets comparable to kubricks barry lyndon
Nov 28 2023,negative,omg people were either fast asleep or talking to each other during the movie way too long and  boring two stars for the actors thats it
Nov 28 2023,negative,its not easy to make a movie about napoleon but this movie is the worst it could have been i went to the theatre with low expectations and this movie still disappointed    all the scenes of the life of napoleon lasts maybe less than a minute each there are cuts where you find napoleon years later in another location for example egypt and you dont even know what the hell he is doing there too much screen time for the relationship with giuseppina and the two battles of waterloo and austerlitz and not even the minimum required for the rest of the scenes about his life    my middle school history book was more in depth that this movie    complete waste of money and 3h of time
Nov 28 2023,negative,what a disappointment i was really looking forward to seeing this i love biopics period pieces joaquin phoenix  ridley scott however because there was too much crammed into one film it lacked cohesion focus depth and authenticity instead of covering every poignant milestone of napoleons adult life with very little detail perhaps scott shouldve just focused on one decade maybe then this film couldve provided phoenix the space needed to do what he does so well bring his character to life by revealing the complex layers of their personality
Nov 28 2023,negative,disingenuous an insult to the french people
Nov 28 2023,positive,dramatic war scenes are believable the baselessness of napoleon himself was conveyed  i enjoyed it though the afterthought is it seemed too short
Nov 28 2023,neutral,its okay  i usually like a historical biopic but this was missing something
Nov 28 2023,positive,fantastic history lesson and an incredible performance by joaquin
Nov 28 2023,positive,if you are a history buff this film isnt for you however if you have an appetite for period drama period fantasy period fiction films you are going to enjoy this one its an audiovisual spectacle with a different rather humorous take on the genre and yet manages to deliver big time on the battle front cant wait for the 4h directors cut
Nov 28 2023,positive,great movie excellent actor actions dynamic buttle cleans story i havent seen such an exciting movie for a long time definitely worth watching
Nov 28 2023,positive,liked the history     i thought lighting was on the dark side
Nov 28 2023,negative,i had high hopes for napoleon but wow it was boring i like joaquin phoenix but he couldnt have played this character any flatter or more lifeless i guess its the current thing to make a mockery of famous men because they sure did it here with napoleon humping josephine like a dog and all the people around him seeming to have more sense than he did like many biopics it skims along never slowing down for such trivialities as character development or good dialogue quite a disappointment
Nov 28 2023,negative,walked out after 45 minutes of wasted life please dont waste your time and money on this movie instead watch holdovers you will absolutely love it  have a great day
Nov 28 2023,negative,not what i expected i blame myself  falling for the trailers and realizing this movie is not interested in history so many key moments jump around on the timeline and often way too short
Nov 28 2023,negative,awful depiction of the general why flesh out josephine when you just throw her entire plot away at the end i hope the 4 hour cut is better
Nov 28 2023,positive,a very good movie the visuals were fantastic the history was as accurate as could be expected from hollywood the acting was excellent napolean was not a charmer he was an odd duck and very awkward in oneonone conversation  he was obsessed with josephine he wrote her letters on the eve of battle i think the relatively poor reviews are a result of many not being familiar with the history or believing too much in the myth
Nov 28 2023,positive,it was just ok i didnt hate it and it was funnier than i expected but it wasnt the epic historical battle movie i wanted and that the trailers sold
Nov 28 2023,positive,near epic in the battle scenes
Nov 28 2023,positive,napoleon is made for the big screen its an epic tale that includes some spectacular set pieces but also a film that i found disjointed and honestly a little dull ridley scott has made some truly great films over the years but i would contend that his latest output is often found a little wanting this film tracks the life of napoleon bonaparte from his commanding victory at the battle of toulon in 1793 to his rise as general and ultimately emperor of france before his exile to st helena at the end of his life the film also shows his courtship and marriage to josephine this is probably the more interesting part of the film as it tries to show the human side to the maniacal ruler the rest moves from battle to battle and leaves little time to breathe i often find this a weakness of biopics covering too much ground and giving the audience a rather thin story thus i was never truly engaged in the story of napoleon the battle scenes are great especially the epic austerlitz but the interludes all felt a bit pedestrian performances are generally good but i think joaquin pheonix has been better vanessa kirby is the true standout as josephine she is wonderful i guess this film begs the question did we really need another film about napoleon in this case i honestly dont think so
Nov 28 2023,negative,this movie was absolutely horrible the pacing was ridiculously slow the war scenes were just ok and napoleon was an aloof childish idiot im sure that someone who rose to power so swiftly and conquered so much territory was a little smarter than portrayed in this movie it tried to be funny at parts and failed miserably it felt like scott couldnt decide what type of movie he wanted this to bespoof comedy drama romance anywho he failed on all accounts acting was so so if youre in the mood for a good nap or some aimless nonsense  this is definitely the movie for you disclaimer  im a fan of scott phoenix and kirby
Nov 28 2023,positive,epic battle scenes  in prospective very sad
Nov 28 2023,positive,completely ignored his  greatest legacy in legal  and administrative reforms napoleonic code which are in use even today
Nov 28 2023,positive,despite the criticisms that this biopic paints napoleon in a negative light especially in regard to his tortious relationship with josephine the visuals are truly epic i wasnt bored once during this 2 12 hour film when the 4hour directors cut comes out ill be first in line to watch it
Nov 28 2023,negative,this movie is a shallow account of napoleons life with a focus only on his military campaigns and  sex life  there was no character development in this film  i recommend skipping the movie and googling him instead
Nov 28 2023,positive,good movie  skipped over some important historical events   sound was too loud especially when songs and cannon blasts went off  had to plug my ears several times
Nov 28 2023,positive,sweeping period drama of the rise and fall of napoleon and josephine similar in feel to nicholas and alexandra  a bit long but worth seeing for the cinematography costumes and the backdrop of post revolutionary france
Nov 28 2023,negative,hard to know where to start the script was poor the cinematography depressing and the acting dreary if the british had really wanted to punish napolean they would not have sent him to an island exile they would have made him watch this movie
Nov 28 2023,negative,what a mess  go watch wqaterloo instead
Nov 28 2023,positive,we did expect more from ridley scott yes the war scenes are excellent but thats it it seems very disjointed and 4 of us  were underwhelmed  josephine in the movie lacked charisma  average movie
Nov 28 2023,negative,not great     and unnecessarily long
Nov 28 2023,negative,considered ruthless and one of the greatest military minds and this provided no character development if you knew nothing about him going in you still know nothing  it felt like a bad quirky comedy versus an epic period piece  it was extremely disappointing
Nov 28 2023,positive,there is nothing we can do
Nov 28 2023,negative,the complete absence of any possible explanation for napoleons actions was infuriating i left the theater asking but why what was napoleons motive he seemed to get pleasure from nothing why did he even bother sadly the film did not inspire me to research the subject it only made me hate every single person involved the historical figures portrayed and the entire cast and crew of the film itself badly done
Nov 28 2023,negative,the movie had a lot of gaps in the storyline was it about the battles was it about the government of france was it about a love story between napoleon and josephine  who knew  just plain boring sorry we wasted our money
Nov 28 2023,negative,so disappointed in this movie best parts of the movie were in the trailer
Nov 28 2023,negative,wanted more of historical explanations never knew of napoleons great love for josephine needed an intermission
Nov 28 2023,negative,the movie was bad they glossed over the history and focused on a mild uninteresting marriage there were more intercourse scenes in the movie than war scenes they explain 0 to nothing about napoleon past and almost all the history part is cut into 5 minutes where you barely understand why that happened or its just mentioned as if it wasnt something important 
Nov 28 2023,positive,the vignettes were very choppy and the time jumps very abrupt  the battle scenes were amazing beyond description a nice primer to start peoples understanding of that time and napoleon himself
Nov 28 2023,positive,the film was good for what it is ridley scott definitely takes liberties regarding historical accuracy but thats not what most people came for most people came for a gladiatoresque tale of romance and violence and id say on that front scott delivered
Nov 28 2023,positive,i enjoyed the film but really felt it was about 30 minutes or so too long there are some scenes in the film that just kill the momentum great cast though i would give it a 6510
Nov 28 2023,positive,great battle scenes and costumes not enough to make a great film
Nov 28 2023,negative,battle sequences are epic but hardly make up for the horrible story telling you leave knowing nothing about napoleon as a person leader or military strategist they make him look like a buffoon who stumbled into everything he accomplished waste of a movie
Nov 28 2023,negative,flat not bad but not impressive
Nov 27 2023,negative,not sure what the director was going for the war sequences and cinematography was excellent but the emotions and the feeling the audience went away with is  what a waste
Nov 27 2023,positive,this film flew by seamlessly and i thoroughly enjoyed it the duke of wellingtons part was small but i was totally impressed by him on the battlefield  excellent stuff
Nov 27 2023,positive,i was so looking forward to this movie but sadly disappointed  i found it extremely boring and almost got up half way inmaybe before halfway and walked out
Nov 27 2023,negative,absolutely terrible film
Nov 27 2023,neutral,the battle scenes are monumental and wellchoreographed the dialogue on the other hand often seems forced and even unintentionally ridiculous historical accuracy also doesnt seem to have been very high on the list of priorities
Nov 27 2023,negative,just another ridley scott failure  if you are truly going to make a historical motion picture then stick to the history  dont make it up because you think it looks really cool  i will say that it does look spectacular  shame they didnt spend time on the script  phoenix is a good actor but a poor choice for portraying napoleon  also what is with the american accent with everyone else portraying characters with accents that really took me out of the movie  what a shame
Nov 27 2023,neutral,slow undetailed with a no attention catching story
Nov 27 2023,positive,fantastic and hilarious
Nov 27 2023,negative,the battle scenes were absolutely enthralling and exciting but everything outside of those was almost painful to watch napoleon acts like a caricature and it seems every personal scene of him was made to make the audience cringe and be disgusted by him doesnt due the history justice
Nov 27 2023,negative,most biopics are just plotless slogs that usually dont tell you anything you didnt already know about the titular character napoleon is no different   theres a whole myriad of aspects to napoleon that could make for fascinating storytelling his origins his motivations his megalomania  rather than make any real attempt at something compelling scott instead strings together a series of disjointed dreary sequences all underpinned by the subplot of the marriage or to be more precise the loveless one sided obsession  only in contemporary hollywood could the idea of director telling the story of a man he clearly views with contempt seem like a good idea
Nov 27 2023,negative,hard to watch please for your safety dont go
Nov 27 2023,negative,there are some brilliant moments in the film but it falls short due to historical inaccuracies and lack of character depth overall it was underwhelming
Nov 27 2023,positive,battle scenes  romance with josephine very good there were a few slow parts in the movie good history
Nov 27 2023,positive,found a lot of gaps in the story young napoleon was not credibly represented by joaquim phoenix imho lots of details in costumes and battles maybe there should have been more attention to the storyline and the characters also found it focused on the negative view should have been more balanced
Nov 27 2023,positive,acting and cinematic were great ran a little long
Nov 27 2023,negative,it was just watching joaquin be himself and not the character in any way such a disappointment
Nov 27 2023,positive,interesting flowed at  a good pace i would have found more enjoyment had i read up on him prior to watching
Nov 27 2023,negative,my son saw it and said it is too long hard to follow and just a mess  really was excited to see it but will not now
Nov 27 2023,negative,while the production quality of the napoleon is undeniably impressive it unfortunately falls short in terms of substance the film seems to make a clear attempt to ridicule the main character but the narrative is disappointingly incoherent the disconnect between the high production values and the lackluster storytelling leaves the audience with a sense of missed potential despite the visual appeal the film fails to deliver a compelling and cohesive experience ultimately diminishing its overall impact
Nov 27 2023,positive,the love story did not seem cheesy or fake it actually worked the attention to historical detail in the tactics and equipment used in battle was refreshing only thing is it was hard to see them cram a figure like napoleon into 2 12 hrs not sure that part fully worked
Nov 27 2023,negative,good production technically speaking as almost any other ridley scott film good acting as expected but i felt somethings missing like in most of scotts recent films storywise it feels rushed and incomplete with some holes
Nov 27 2023,negative,this movie sucks farts
Nov 27 2023,neutral,what makes this movie is joaquin phoenixs great performance the movie itself had moments of brilliance especially during napoleons rise to power and his battles followed by long amounts of time being totally and nonsensically sidetracked the movie getting sidetracked like that was frustrating because there were much more important things that ridley scott should have focused on especially considering the subject matter
Nov 27 2023,positive,i didnt enjoy it it felt like a mishmash of certain points during his life with a high focus on josephine the historical accuracy was also poor during certain scenes which were painful to watch
Nov 27 2023,positive,great set pieces great cinematography great action writing well lets just say its not that good
Nov 27 2023,negative,very far away to show napoleon as one of the biggest military masterminds mostly focusing on a weird love relationship and oh by the way he invaded russia kind of movie i didnt know that in europe they used miles in the 19 th century
Nov 27 2023,negative,dragged out more about his love life than anything battle scenes were good but short left out too much at the end
Nov 27 2023,positive,the acting was excellent  and i learned some history
Nov 27 2023,negative,most people who gave good ratings to this movie have no clue about history scotts napoleon is always old even when he is young he is old gloomy tired and completely charismadeprived grotesque weird fool its hard to imagine he could have captivated crowds and his soldiers loved him the number of absurdities i saw in this movie is enough to talk about all day napoleon did not shoot at the pyramids nor did he sink the austrian army in the icy depths of austerlitz and he did not beat josephine he also did not charge into battles on horseback an english sniper with a straptied scope to a rifle in the first half of the 19th century  whats next the tanks in the court of king arthur the film is an absurd farce and a completely ahistorical creation and the worst part is that it is simply incredibly boring
Nov 27 2023,negative,very poor and too long  acting and dialogue not good  story content poor  napoleon was left handed but in film signed three documents with his right hand
Nov 27 2023,positive,slow  more of a love story than an action packed history of his leadership
Nov 27 2023,positive,very factual regarding battles great battle scenes accurate information about conditions in prison the love story was a little flat
Nov 27 2023,negative,overall the film was ok at best the battle scenes were appalling from a historical point of view a baker rifle with a scope was just laughable and almost nothing about the battle of waterloo was accurate however if you are not after film purely for entertainment and have no prior knowledge of what actually happened you will probably enjoy it
Nov 27 2023,positive,probably the best film ive seen in the cinema this year so far
Nov 27 2023,neutral,the real character napoleon is greater than oppenheimer i can not say the same about the movies by a million miles
Nov 27 2023,negative,dumb movie that only focus on a overexaggerated love story no context if you dont understand the topic well  huge historic innacuracies that you can search on wikipedia within 30 seconds battle tactics places of interest and uniforms also using miles as a distance meter and not getting actors from each country to make it genuine and realistic shows how this is the usual americancentric movie
Nov 27 2023,positive,gorgeous  rare to find a film with so much to offer  cant wait for 4 hour directors cut
Nov 27 2023,positive,at 86 years old the legendary director ridley scott returns with a historical epic arousing the interest  and criticism  of historians around the world especially in france his work portrays the life of napoleon bonaparte 17691821 the controversial french general who became emperor and died in exile played by joaquin phoenix    its important to highlight the controversy involving historians complaints claiming that scotts direction did not adhere to the historical minutiae of the french emperors life complaints vary from the french bombing pyramids in egypt which never happened to the length of marie antoinettes 17551793 hair during her public execution among other details in other words there is nothing that completely destroys the historical credibility of the film    indeed napoleon is not a purely historical work nor does it claim to be joaquin phoenix himself explained the obvious if you want to really understand napoleon then you should probably do your own studying and reading because if you see this film its this experience told through ridleys eyes    thus it is worth discussing ridley scotts vision the film is huge in scope and duration as expected given the stature of its main character the enormous battle sequences brilliantly presented with cuttingedge practical special effects contrast with the calmer scenes focused on dialogue portraying bonapartes greatest love the stunning joséphine de beauharnais 1763  1814 played by actress vanessa kirby     there is a certain repetition in this formula which becomes increasingly tedious over its 2 hours and 38 minutes duration there are also some gaps in the development and motivation of characters something scott himself promised will be corrected in the extended 4hour version to be available on streaming services starting next year    scotts napoleon is an interesting figure dark calculating imposing but at the same time possessive passionate petulant indeed the work presented will displease many but it is undeniable that it succeeds in showing the different facets of such a controversial man
Nov 27 2023,positive,fantastic a travel to middle age europe and all the battles its more concentrated in relationship between napoleon and josefina but shows all important battles and the dramatic scenes
Nov 27 2023,positive,war scenes were great but story did not develop well  hard to understand at some points due to lack of explanation     little long as well
Nov 27 2023,negative,i do not understand how anyone could cast jp as napoleon hes too weak too feminine has no strength or force in his voice there is no way that he could portray someone french or corsican to have the power to do what napoleon did not that i have favour war in anything and conquest is a waste of time when done through war however it makes the film really weak    however vanessa kirby is astonishing man shes beautiful she really knows her strength i only watch this movie because of her how she acts is amazing she knows herself so well i wish i could meet her personally
Nov 27 2023,negative,boring story no explanation of characters motivations seemed to jump around without any real context  battle scenes were decent
Nov 27 2023,positive,i expected more from the movie especially given its theme and cast unfortunately it didnt do a good job showing why napoleon was a great leader the focus on his vulnerabilities from his relationship with josephine overshadowed his military goals which were unclear the movie mostly showed him fighting for frances honor and personal gain leaving out any higher purposes the josephine story which i thought would be a side plot became the main theme additionally the editing lacked cohesiveness which added to the overall disappointment im curious how the french people will feel about the portrayal of one of their historic heroes
Nov 27 2023,negative,i feel completely mislead by the trailers poor show
Nov 27 2023,positive,joaquin phoenix was fantastic and i really enjoyed this movie
Nov 27 2023,positive,i wish there was more info on how napoleon got so be so powerful instead of focusing on his sex life and love for his cheating josephine i love joaquin phoenix  but i never felt he was quite right as napoleon  i admittedly know very little about french history and this movie didnt teach me much at all didnt hate it didnt love it i wanted more
Nov 27 2023,positive,really had high expectations so was expecting to love it and walked away meh directing and battle scenes were adroitly done as expected but the film had no soul no ironically  je ne sais quoi really felt like i was watching a filmed version of a history book like a sold couple chapters of western civ almost expected to get an audit credit for watching   the acting was just fine but nothing to take note on it really just felt like a day in the life of napoleon spread out over 30 years so if you like your history long scenery accurate and played by talented actors then enjoy otherwise watch marie antoinette on  pbs great costuming and a real compelling look at the times
Nov 27 2023,positive,the battle scenes were amazing
Nov 27 2023,negative,this movie is as made to mock napoleon and nothing more they completely skip his conquests and just show him being a weirdo it doesnt even try to be fair to him like yeah hes a weird man but hes a skilled general watch its just one scene hes acting like a complete simp which isnt how he was at all then the next scene hes blasting the pyramids talking about the italy conquests why not show the conquests thats right cause its about mocking him dont believe this score on here because you know rottentomatoes takes bribes
Nov 27 2023,neutral,liked the story line it took forever to get to it     disliked the length of the story given that everybody has a scenario in mind of napoleon
Nov 27 2023,positive,the movie is overlong and manages to make napoleon bonaparte into a bore  they capture his egotism and his love for josephine but his military genius is treated as an afterthought and there is no mention at all of his reforms to french government  the film shows its english origins  bonaparte is shown basically to be an uncouth thug  while it also takes some swipes at the royalty of europe wellington is shown in an extremely favorable light  phoenix is 5 cm taller than bonaparte was 2 inches and thats unfortunate  while he is slightly shorter than most of the cast the difference is nowhere as dramatic as it might have been with a shorter lead  in terms of the performances phoenix has done much better in other roles  the screenplay doesnt give him much to work with  somehow bonaparte is a very flat character with almost no emotional depth  hes reduced to a caricature pursuing josephine by crawling on the floor like a pig even while servants watch
Nov 27 2023,negative,i thought the movie was disappointing i think ridley scott is showing his age and is lacking creativity this movie was okay there were some scenes that i enjoyed but i was hoping for a gladiator like movie but this was just boring
Nov 27 2023,positive,it was alright but didnt have some of the scenes from the traileroverall mehh
Nov 27 2023,negative,i was very disappointed and my wife actually fell asleep i would not waist my time or money on this movie
Nov 27 2023,negative,even in movies i didnt like i always appreciated joaquin phoenix performances not this one his portrayal was very wooden and onenote
Nov 27 2023,neutral,should have been called napoleon and josephinea love story not very cohesive it dragged on i expected a little more from ridley scott
Nov 27 2023,positive,the story was somewhat covered  shame the beginning of power was scoffed over  the visuals  were superb  only a few discrepancies    all in all  quite a spectacle
Nov 27 2023,negative,what was good the battles they showed looked great all of the period clothes and atmosphere were fantastic i think making napoleon quite awkward was a nice touch the pacing in the first 20 minutes was exciting    however this movie missed hugely important parts of his career napoleon is one of the most influential figures in western history and somehow half of the movie is about him bedding his wife its important but not so important that it needed to take so much of the movie in lieu of say the napoleónic code they also made up that he shot the pyramids which is ridiculous and doesnt really even fit his character     i have wanted a napoleon movie to break down an interesting character and now well have to wait longer
Nov 27 2023,positive,thrilling epic and surprising  one of the best of ridley scott  the battle scenes are the best part
Nov 27 2023,positive,good movie and worth a watch a lot of people trashed this movie but its a good mix of his personal life and action on the battlefield
Nov 27 2023,positive,this is not a bad movie dont be fooled by what anyone says but it has some big issues  and this is comming from a nonhistorian   the movie was too long and too short at the same time weird i know it seemed to me ridley scott did not know if he wanted to make a historical epic war drama or a romantic movie for the ages   the costumes are amazing the filming of the movie great the acting good from pheonix and great from kirby actually she is the one pulling it up for me   but the writing lacks the directing lacks and the editing severly lacks
Nov 27 2023,positive,a huge challenge to take the whole life requires a certain short hand to be used the lack of a dense script creates a rather impressionistic headlines approach clearly very stylistic key decisions were taken about how the two main characters where to be played it was clearly a conscious decision and they have to own it they will not be to everybodys taste it is well done but is it a rewarding experience for the audience i am not sure the look and feel and battles are very well done does the story and characterisation provide a rich involving intellectually satisfying experience not quite it has a touch of the duellists standoffish reportage about it maybe the 4 hour telly version might paint a more detailed engaging story the 25 hrs went quickly
Nov 27 2023,negative,the film napoleon can be characterized as deeply disappointing primarily due to its unwarranted emphasis on napoleon bonapartes romantic relationship with josephine one might argue that the title should have been joseph and napoleon to better reflect the movies disproportionate focus regrettably the film neglects the pivotal military campaigns and strategic brilliance that defined napoleons historical significance choosing instead to delve into the rather mundane aspects of his personal life    in light of this deviation from the core elements that made napoleon an icon it is disheartening to witness a filmmaker of ridley scotts caliber appear to stray from his usual standard of excellence this cinematic endeavor feels like an unfortunate departure from his typically outstanding body of work and one cant help but perceive it as a regrettable misstep in his career
Nov 27 2023,negative,this movie represented one of the most feared and interesting historical figures of all time as a simpleton lacking in personality  rename it the fantasies of josephine more fitting
Nov 27 2023,positive,this is a gigantic beautiful meticulously detailed movie that has a fatally muddled narrative the history is not clearly presented the romantic dialogue is wooden and a central character who fascinated the whole world doesnt fascinate so much on screen its still a spectacular movie for visuals alone but it could have been a really great one
Nov 27 2023,negative,too much of a life to pack into this waste of 25 hours terrible pacing offputting portrayals of all characters and you dont come away with any grasp of what made napoleon a remarkable but controversial figure no appreciation for historical accuracy even the battles were boring with the exception of the siege of toulon
Nov 27 2023,negative,wrongly advertised as a war movie and ended up being mostly about napoleons dysfunctional relationship with his estranged wife i swear they had more than 12 scenes of napoleon arriving in to an estate walking through the door and engages in an extremely slow and awkward conversation with josephine even then josephine is depicted as a plank of wood i walked out of the movie knowing nothing about her or even caring about her she was mostly silent averting his gaze holding a tear in her eye with a thousand yard stare in every scene important historical figures to the time period were hardly introduced and came and went like a revolving door the only character you even have the opportunity to make a connection with is napoleon because theres not really anyone else with a character to follow on screen even then napoleon doesnt have much of a character arc in the movie and is depicted as a miserable piece of garbage so you dont care about anyone in the movie i was disengaged the whole time doesnt mean the movie should have depicted napoleon as a hero because he wasnt in my opinion ridley scott could have created a character to follow alongside napoleon to actually like and care about along with understanding the environment 85 of this movie plays out like a jane austen novel without the social complexities making you check your phone to estimate how much time is left in the movie the other 15 of the film is fantastic those war scenes they heavily advertised were outstanding the uniforms maneuvers big guns and dramatic sequences were all amazing when napoleon says goodbye to his wife after a weird 10 minute sequence you sit up in your seat knowing you were about to be dazzled with a battle scene depicted with so much detail not seen before for this time period if ridley scott made 85 of the movie about napoleon and the napoleonic wars with the same amount of detail they did for those battle scenes easily could have been the best film made in the last 10 years this movie is a great example of many of the problems with movies today and how disconnected hollywood has become made me lose even more trust and i am going to avoid seeing movies in the theaters to avoid wasting time
Nov 27 2023,negative,very bad historical piece to portray one of the greatest military leaders in history as somewhat of a buffoon constantly chasing after his wife was a really bad take  i almost thought monty python made this movie
Nov 27 2023,negative,this film should be called joséphine a complete disappointment
Nov 27 2023,negative,if you know literally anything about napoleon youre probably going to hate this movie
Nov 27 2023,positive,great visual detail and interesting character portraitures
Nov 27 2023,positive,plenty of shock and awe very believable battle scenes whew overall a little too long fairly accurate with some exceptions a good popcorn movie
Nov 27 2023,positive,learned new historical info
Nov 27 2023,positive,i had different expectations in my opinion i did not do napoleon justice and portrayed mostly his weird sides also many timeskips which made it a bit messy and just very little context   but the battle sequences where beutifully done
Nov 27 2023,positive,battle scenes were the highlight no gladiator but i enjoyed it
Nov 27 2023,negative,very funny movie  had me laughing out loud in the theater      ridley makes a comedy who would have thought
Nov 27 2023,positive,good video and visual effects action sequences wardrobe and acting  terrible storyline and historical coherence  the plot of the movie is basically focused on the dysfunctional relationship between napoleon and josephine  that storyline dominates the movie over the rise to power historical achievements and timeline of napoleons life  very poor explanation of why battles are being fought or the context in the storyline      this movie is an embarrassment in writing made digestible with good action and costumes
Nov 27 2023,negative,the worst militaryhistoric film since gods  generals a travesty beautifully photographed and acted but the content was comical bore no relationship to the actual napoleon or the times in which he lived to mr scott who grows more narcissistic by the hour in reply to your comment about historians getting a life i say to you get a palliative care nurse youre obviously at that end stage of life where you need one for surely your mental faculties are diminished
Nov 27 2023,negative,not enough character development  i thought id learn more about napolean but this movies focus was the battle scenes  i was dissappointed in this movie as were the other five people in my group
Nov 27 2023,negative,no character development confusing story
Nov 27 2023,positive,i decided to see napoleon for two reasons i like joaquin phoenix and i like history i really appreciate the telling of napoleons story through a different perspective that showed his more vulnerable side  phoenix did an excellent job in the role as did the young lady who played the role of josephine his wife  i also unexpectedly learned about war strategies that were used during that time period and i was able to more fully understand how napoleon was revered as a brilliant emperor and fighter  my only complaint is that the there were too many battle scenes and they were too long    other than that the movie was really good
Nov 27 2023,negative,honestly there is not anything positive i can say about this movie i was immensely disappointed in it i was so excited to see it but after seeing a lot of negative reviews i lowered my expectations going into it still it didnt even meet those lowered expectations it is not a good movie i cant even say that i just sat back and decided to enjoy it for what it was because it wasnt enjoyable even the battle scenes were mediocre the only scene that grabbed my attention was the coronation and only because it so closely mimicked jacqueslouis davids iconic painting but the rest of the movie was justboring the story jumped around and had no flow to it the performances by phoenix and kirby werent even that good they were so many weird moments where i felt like the scene was an outtake not an actual shot that made the cut like when napoleon suddenly wipes josephines face with a cloth and her lip flops down suddenly and dont even get me started on how they handled languages if youre going to make a film about that era with almost all british actors then just lean into that and have them all speak english obviously i would have preferred that the characters all spoke the languages they spoke in real life but i know not everyone is okay with subtitles but here they had these weird moments where it was like they forgot they had decided to forgo linguistic authenticity in one scene two russian soldiers suddenly speak russian to each other and there were no subtitles then two characters are speaking english to each other and one of them suddenly says something in german and there are subtitles and the other character an englishman responds in bad german and again there are subtitles it was so odd     overall my sons reaction to the movie sums it up best they said that for the entire movie they felt like they were waiting for something to happen and then it ended
Nov 27 2023,positive,interesting strory toid well but could have had a bit less of the protracted battle scenes  a little long but entertainiing and worth the time  somewhat educational into french history as well assuming the reasonable accuracy of the content
Nov 27 2023,negative,i had high hopes for this movie because of the trailer i believe the movie couldve been cut down to an hour and 45 minutes and been amazing the fact that it was so long and some of the scenes were very confusing on what the hell was going on there were holes in the story that never quite made sense there were parts added to the movie that didnt make sense joaquin phoenix was amazing but the movie was disappointing
Nov 27 2023,positive,very good production would like to know how much was special effects and what was real i think napolean was and interesting character lots of action with no dead spots
Nov 27 2023,positive,had a really fun time with this one napoleon has always been depicted as a brilliant tactician but no one ever dives into his social life he was awkward and rude and some speculate he may have been on the spectrum this portrayal was an honest take at the famous emperor with impressive battle scenes and hilarious social antics that made me simultaneously laugh and cringe waterloo felt a little rushed for such a pivotal battle and i hope ridley scott releases a directors cut with deleted scenes that extend the battle of waterloo and other parts of the movie like he did for kingdom of heaven fantastic film over all
Nov 27 2023,negative,disappointing felt like a simple historydramatization of napoleons life  no real depth or excitement just blah visually it was great and the actors all did well a very dull story that was essentially a history lesson that left a lot to be desired
Nov 27 2023,positive,some slow moments   but a visual spectacle not to be missed on the big screen
Nov 27 2023,positive,mikeys movie review napoleon 2023    despite feeling somewhat incomplete with regard to some of the playershistoric events featured in the film clocking in at 2 hours 38 minutes it doesnt feel too long director ridley scott has himself said that even though a 35 hour version will arrive exclusively for apple tv this is his directors cut    the fact that 85 year old scott got to make this at all is down to his unbelievable determination and intense work ethic stanley kubrick charlie chaplin steven spielberg and even baz luhrmann all tried and failed to bring napoleon to life     although backdropped by his various campaigns here the rise and fall of the famous french emperor napoleon bonaparte expertly performed by joaquin phoenix is essentially a love story albeit a strange volatile and twisted one    napoleon was relentless but also a visionary tactical strategist his two great loves  josephine and france itself constantly informed his decisions whether political or by conquest phoenix digs deep beneath his complexities and creates a fully rounded man his portrayal is far beyond any clichéd caricature     vanessa kirby as josephine is fabulous i feel i know and understand her better more than just napoleons love interest she has her own agenda and politics that are just as fascinating and intriguing as the main protagonist    each battle has its own distinctive character using practical fx as well as 300 men 100 horses and 11 cameras they have an explosive brutality and visceral believability unlike anything youve seen on the big screen for some time the 200 million budget well spent it also features brilliant performances from the likes of tahar rahim paul barras ben miles coulancourt and a delightful cameo from rupert everett as wellington    rarely missing a beat it occasionally overwhelms thankfully all 61 battles arent portrayed but scott manages to reign in the epic scope and trim any excess fat from the film as a piece of entertainment its an occasionally moving fascinating work about a complicated figure that could perhaps revive interest in historical movie making    its the kind of cinematic epic that deserves to be written large and seen on the big screen and good indication that scott might well deliver a spectacular sequel to gladiator in 2024    mikeys movie rating 45
Nov 27 2023,positive,i liked every bit of the movie  the action was awesome  the history of napoleon was great
Nov 27 2023,positive,the battle scenes were amazing phoenix was very believable in his character definitely recommend if you are a history buff
Nov 27 2023,negative,i went into this movie with such high expectations hoping to get a biopic that did justice to the incredible life of this historical figure instead we got a very confusing horribly executed film that focused way more on his relationship with josephine than on any of his military strategies and was overall just awkward so so awkward i hate to say it but this is probably the worst movie ive seen all year
Nov 27 2023,negative,whatever one may think of napoleon bonaparte there was grandeur and glory where is any of that in this very gray film  and oh the absurdities was he on the cusp of ejaculation when he was about to storm toulon  what else explains the rapid short breaths as he sits on his horse giving the order  did scott have so little faith in the dialog that he had phoenix deliver his lines so unintelligibly  the painted backdrops in the long shots are out of a 50s epic  the battle scenes are sufficiently horrifying and the palaces and the costumes are sufficiently luxurious  all hail wellington as portrayed by rupert everett
Nov 27 2023,negative,boring derivative and unhistorical to the highest degree ridley scotts napoleon fails on almost every level
Nov 27 2023,negative,disappointment  a big disappointment    beautiful cinematography but the script is so bad the film tries to cover 22 years of napoleons life which was extraordinaire in so many aspects that means it jumps from one event to the next with no depth to joaquin phoenixs portrait of napoleon     i know that it is not a documentary but calling it napoleon would suggest some resemblance with events and his character and i felt nothing of the energy military genius and reforms to society that napoleon is credited with through numerous historical sources instead he is an unsecure awkward person with only small burst of energy and i did not see why he went from revolutionary to emperor    to sum it up it is a very british depiction of napoleon
Nov 27 2023,positive,i thought this was a very captivating movie there were quite a few good battle scenes spread throughout the movie but i wish they had focused on his military career more yes napoleon was a man too and we cant completely leave out the other portions of his life but i feel as though far too much of the movie focused on napoleons relationship with josephine especially given how much his military career was emphasized in the advertisements for the movie   did they love each other yes was their relationship filled with scandals yes did they divorce after failing to produce an heir yes the portrayal of their relationship was probably fairly spot on but we didnt need this much detail and i could certainly have lived without the few lewd scenes shared between the two in the film it was entirely unnecessary to have included that in the film
Nov 27 2023,positive,we loved the movie  not sure why it is rated low
Nov 27 2023,negative,this was by far the worst movie i have ever seen the acting was so bad it seemed liked a slapstick comedy  the battle scenes had no historical facts    the sets and costumes were insanely bad    what the heck was this pos i want to sue someone and get my 14 back
Nov 27 2023,positive,disappointing i expect this movie to be true to napoleons biography and i hoped they would portray him in a positive light because he was actually a genius and there hasnt been anyone like him but thats not what happened it was the complete opposite they made him to be a lunatic that depended on josephine for direction not worth watching if you want to know more about napoleon read books
Nov 27 2023,negative,what a terrible movie   a disaster in terms of historical accuracy apart from the costumes and uniforms half a star for that and not even entertaining as a film in itself     a film that tries to portray both the military and private aspects of napoleon and it fails utterly on both counts  the battles depicted in the film could not be further from reality it seems that the makers have not dealt with the warfare of the early 19th century in any way     the character of napoleon is portrayed as weak mostly bored lecherous and generally very sleepy what a dreadful adaptation i wouldnt even trust the onscreen napoleon to find the toilet on his own and this man is supposed to have ruled and revolutionised the whole of europe   i dont think so    all in all an enormous waste of time and a pity about the budget
Nov 27 2023,negative,if you know history you wanna scream if you dont know it you dont understand why they are suddenly in the desert shooting at pyramids the battles scenes are so poorly done the love story is boring the average american will probably enjoy it as the costumes are excellent
Nov 27 2023,negative,boooooooring little or no character development plodding pace  despite skipping over years of history poorly acted poorly written dialogue just plain mediocre
Nov 27 2023,positive,overall i feel like the movie concentrated too much on the love story of napoleon and josephine instead of his journey from a nobody in corsica to the emperor of france i do understand that it is difficult to put the extraordinary life of such a gigantic character as napoleon into a movie and josephine was definitely a big part of his life but maybe the priorities should have been focussed on why was he so loved by the french people how he dominated all rivals during his career how he was potentially the or one of the greatest military strategist of all times how he inspired meritocracy and code civil etc etc at times it kinda felt like the movie could have done better at spinning the story and the important events were at times rushed over  some of the battles were also great like the austerlitz battle  that being said i wouldnt mind watching it again but i just think this was somewhat of a missed opportunity also while napoleons career was bloody he also does represent positive characteristics as i mentioned before instead of in the end only putting numbers on how many died maybe it would be smart and balanced to name a few things that make him memorable and the figurativegiant in history he was
Nov 27 2023,positive,this wasnt boring at all not a lot of action going on but the way he felt made me feel the same when he had to leave his wife because of the baby that made me want to cry
Nov 27 2023,negative,its weird but theres no body language in this film no one moves every interior feels like a cold dim house where someones left the door open   ridley scott says theres been over 10000 books written about napoleon you think he could have read one then  its  a boring film about napoleon how do you manage that  this is a bit of a disastrous expedition so  hes got  a bit in common with boney poor ole ridley scott of the antarctic
Nov 27 2023,negative,i am shocked that the genius that directed some of my favorite movies ever blade runner 2049 gladiator american gangster managed to f this one up so bad  this is disinformation in its purest form   from historical inaccuracies motives for returning to france and start the one hundred days portraying egypt as total victory snatching the crown from the pope to gen z barbie like chick flicky portrayal of one of the most romantic relationships in history between nb and jobeau ridley scott could not have done a more vulgar satirical portrait of the 1st french emperor  zero mentions of crucial characters of napoleons inner circle like his brother joseph or sister caroline nor the relevance  importance or influence that his mother had on himof general murat or marechal neyno mentions of le code civil or la banque de franceor major battles like trafalgar iéna or marengo not even the 5th grade amateur couldve been so reductive   clearly scotts message is quite plain  his movie is meant to continue duke wellingtons lifelong mission to put to shame and dishonor the french imperial eagle a continued stereotype of a brits view of the french   bravo to yates and crossman for the costumes and scott for some nice battlefield shots worst script
Nov 27 2023,neutral,great cinematography horrible script horrible storyline napoleon was a charismatic leader they made him look like a cuck
Nov 27 2023,positive,cinematography outstanding a little gory at times  historical well acted
Nov 27 2023,negative,this is a story with no soul and no emotions my theater was packed and was quiet throughout the runtime we were just so bored some people left even before the end the film wants to show many things but the overall story gets lost the dialogues are insipid the joséphinenapoleon scenes were the most interesting things in the movie but they were too short  too few for the viewer to be invested in that relationship acting is okay but i thought overall the lead actors kirby  phoenix lack chemistry my biggest disappointment was definitely the battle scenes that did little to serve the story there were no stake no tension no thrills the score is also a big miss ridley scott managed to direct a boring movie about one of the most complex and interesting historical figures what a l disappointment
Nov 27 2023,negative,lazy script utterly boring episodic no art no truth
Nov 27 2023,positive,ill wait for the directors cut as this release feels like a rush through the beats in order to get the film done there may be a more interesting and better developed movie to come but what has been released doesnt work much beyond some decent performances and good looking spectacle
Nov 27 2023,negative,an utterly horrible badly edited inconsequential waste of talent maybe the directors cut will make sense when it comes out on apple but anyone who thinks that this collection of 2 minute pastiches is a representation of ridley scotts great skill as a film maker or storyteller then they are afraid of telling the truth this film is a shocker doesnt matter about the historical inaccuracies if the story doesnt make sense
Nov 27 2023,negative,the film is terribile when i got into the cinema i expected to see an epic historical film  i got a parody of a goofy mental instable man who in his spare time when he is not busy making fun of himself to his wife gets into some random battles with whos available at the moment the trailer promised witness the rise and i expected to witness the rise of a man who came from little to nothing to emperor the struggle of such a journey the military genius that made napoleon napoleon this napoleon was very similar to a joker but  driven by an harley queen many have done much better with much less at their disposal my rant is over
Nov 27 2023,positive,there is nothing we can do
Nov 27 2023,negative,dull and repetitive phoenix plays an unconvincing napoleon the guy from bill and teds excellent adventure could have done a better job and the love story part was even worse
Nov 27 2023,negative,overall a very awkward and slow experience other than a few battle scenes it mightve been better as a 45 episode mini series
Nov 27 2023,negative,far from a historical epic  this is an ahistorical romcom with the comedic elements and dialogue straight out of a trashy teen movie the historical inaccuracies are almost painful wellington meeting napoleon in england of all places  particularly scaring so disappointing  the movie attempts to humanise the brilliant general and instead reduces him to some weird cartoonish man child
Nov 27 2023,positive,battle scenes were awesome and epic but the story did not make me fear for or cheer for or care for any of the characters
Nov 27 2023,negative,painfully bad history fact wise absolutely disaster movie plot wise also really bad character wise stinker even the acting is bad
Nov 27 2023,negative,one of the most well documented historical figures and they couldnt get a single thing right    an empty and dull portrayal that made a brilliant leader look like an idiotic childish tool what a waste
Nov 27 2023,positive,joaquin phoenix deserves best actor oscar ridly scott best director fantastic throughout will become a classic
Nov 27 2023,positive,it was long and not focused none of the characters were likable maybe because they werent very well developed
Nov 27 2023,negative,this film was an absolute embarrassment to history and to cinema the only coherent thread tying this dog water of a  movie together is the fact that napoleon is in it we dont get to spend anytime getting to know him or properly setting up the atmosphere or the trajectory of the plot  what we do get are identical scenes strung together as we fast forward through history and are left as clueless about the man we are watching as as the film makers are in the fact that he is a supposedly great military leader what a tragedy ignore the wars and rise to power tell me more about how napoleon licked the ground his wife walked on and barked like a dog on command
Nov 27 2023,negative,trash film  it was just joaquin phoenix being ho hum joaquin phoenix for 3 hours in a bicorn hat that got the history wrong and undermined his intelligence and that of all of france in the process
Nov 27 2023,positive,i enjoyed the acting by kirby and phoenix war scenes were entertaining
Nov 27 2023,negative,tiring and far from historical reality
Nov 27 2023,positive,im the first to admit when i make a mistake i simply never do
Nov 27 2023,positive,well acted and nice production  the story telling is a bit uneven but nonetheless a solid movie with pace  i enjoyed it
Nov 27 2023,positive,its successful at presenting napoleon through his idiosyncratic approach to leadership success and love hes strangely unattractive  using only brutality and the sacrifice of his armys lives to collect power there is a complete lack of charisma his josephine seems only to respect him because hes attentive and unyielding so she makes the best of it the holes in the script and the paradox of his military and personal ethic makes a kind of sense together its worth seeing but predict few nominations kirby steals the show and joaquin phoenix does what he does bringing in this case a quirky character study forward with total commitment
Nov 27 2023,negative,if im going to sit through an overly long movie i want to be moved napoleon was less moving than a history book despite the fine acting and the epic battle scenes  ridley scott covered so much of napoleons life and career that no single part of it carried any weight  i give it a solid 2star meh
Nov 27 2023,negative,after having read  napoleons biography this movie lacks the true essence of this man it leaves out th emost important details of his personality
Nov 27 2023,negative,the worst movie i have watched in the last 10 years
Nov 27 2023,positive,i liked the main characters and the costumes and battle scenes
Nov 27 2023,negative,joaquin phoenix was miscast and horrible in the roll too many battle scenes not enough character study
Nov 27 2023,neutral,script was awful no depth
Nov 27 2023,positive,overall decent movie overviewing napoleons rise and fall battle sequences were stellar but much of the screen time in between is wasted on dialogue that lacks purpose and gratuitous sex scenes at least as much screen time and focus is dedicated to napoleon and josephines relationship as to the historical events of the period leaving the feeling that each is insufficiently explored entertaining but dont expect to learn napoleons history from this movie
Nov 27 2023,neutral,choppy slow and strange
Nov 27 2023,negative,half a star is only on account of the photography the movie is absolutely pathetic a deceiving depiction of napoleon limited to his relationship to josephine and his military strategies without basic historic accuracy definitely a missed opportunity and a total waste of time
Nov 27 2023,negative,zero charisma to avoid if you want to see a movie about napoleon this is not the one if you know history this is will be a funny parody with easter eggs if you do not know napoleons story you will get bored very quickly the exposition is poor joachims interpretation of a corsican is off
Nov 27 2023,positive,as always phoenix is eccentric and emotional the battle scenes are extraordinary  i dont think france will appreciate this version of napoleon
Nov 27 2023,negative,the film is too long and very boring
Nov 27 2023,negative,soooo boring  wasted 3 hours of my time 
Nov 27 2023,negative,an opportunity missed  extremely frustrating  afterwards it i felt like they attempted to tell a 6 hr story within 30 minutes but managed cram it into 25  hrs  almost feel as if they didnt know what part of the story to emphasize  focus on  deliver  disappointing
Nov 27 2023,negative,neither historical instructive nor entertaining it mentions nothing of the vast institutional and scientific progress that napoleon brought to the continent and that are still seen today this could have been forgiven if mr scott used his talents to serve up some stunning displays  of his cunning in the dozens of battles he won instead the movie is almost entirely focused on his failed marriage and portraying napoleon as jealous and vain irritant to the rest of europe also no arc de triomphe scene
Nov 27 2023,neutral,joaquin was definitely miscast for this movie and frankly ridley scott shouldnt have directed either romance scenes were awkward battles had no nuance to them honestly quite insulting to napoleons military genius and large story important moments were cut those who dont know the history and cared were probably lost in a few places and thought of napoleon as just a lucky idiot only plot that any emotion in the whole film was the relationship between napoleon and josephine and even that relationship should have been a footnote at best compared to napoleons rise and fall
Nov 27 2023,positive,joaquin phoenix always has an impressive acting the only thing that was a hit or miss that much time was wasted with the romance with josephine instead of focusing more to his war strategy and battles i dont believe that napoleon had a weak character like he was portrayed as manipulated by his wife
Nov 27 2023,positive,excellent like the story the acting the costumes and the grand scale of this epic film
Nov 27 2023,positive,it tries to cover everything and in the process glosses over everything   and it covers nothing of his second wife who was actually fairly influential in napoleons life
Nov 27 2023,positive,very interesting but a lot was fictional
Nov 27 2023,negative,meh the historical scenes were too shallow the battle scenes were too bloated the love story between napoleon and josephine was the only thing somewhat complelling about the film
Nov 27 2023,positive,loved the characters and story would tell others a must see
Nov 27 2023,negative,slow  save your money and time  i watched my iphone more than the movie
Nov 27 2023,neutral,do not be deceived by the beauty of the cinematography napoleon features a simple and empty plot accompanied by a disjointed and senseless edit despite some good action scenes the settings in each part do not align with the pretext resulting in a lifeless and unengaging film joaquin phoenixs performance is rather lackluster delivering a character with artificial emotions in summary the film loses its way over time dragging a storyline between objectives and love along with several frustrating comedic attempts in large parts of the film that amount to nothing more than cringeworthy moments
Nov 27 2023,negative,very disappointing film i love this genre and love long movies so it wasnt that that accents acting and storyline were subpar it was slow boring and unexciting kinds of cheesy too just wish i could get those 3 hours back 
Nov 27 2023,negative,piece of garbage  un historical has nothing to do with napoleon and france horrible acting and a complete mess     napoleon was bigger than this piece of garbage
Nov 27 2023,positive,interesting  if you like historical drama amazing battle scenes
Nov 27 2023,positive,not too crazy about the sex scenes but also not sure if thats reputed historical accuracy theres no way any producer could put any more into this movie so much to tell the ending explained it all
Nov 27 2023,positive,great scenery costumes and action scenes however character development and acting was weak too much time on josephineheir and nothing on his early years or mgmtmodernization of french govt economy military etc
Nov 27 2023,positive,love historical non fiction movies
Nov 27 2023,negative,its awful in every way  all 4 of us walked out after maybe 45 minutes
Nov 27 2023,positive,it was very wellmade movie
Nov 27 2023,neutral,disappointing movie a lot of marketing but its not good  gross historical errors and the jumps in the script are not understood  maybe the extended version will improve
Nov 27 2023,positive,it was a good movie however not enough detail on napoleon in the beginning
Nov 27 2023,positive,pretty good film imo ridley knows how to make a war film thats for sure no one does battles as well as he does plain and simple the acting is prime as well not sure why its getting such negative reviews it never really went into napoleons younger life but honestly who cares good film it deserves a 1st watch go see it
Nov 27 2023,negative,slow boring and way too long  joaquin phoenix seemed flat for an actor of his caliber  watch it on tv when it comes out
Nov 27 2023,positive,a little too much gore but a great movie
Nov 27 2023,positive,perfectly played beautiful scenes
Nov 27 2023,negative,longlong and somewhat boring
Nov 27 2023,positive,great movie all around joaquin phoenix is predictably amazing as the titular character with vanessa kirby delivering a nuanced performance that deserves equal attention the exploration of their relationship was highly interesting in tandem with napoleons burgeoning military and ruling career as well as both of their subsequent declines
Nov 27 2023,negative,this was ridley scotts version of the invasion of moscow as a huge fan of scotts movies blade runner being one of my alltime favorites and as a napoleonic history buff i was doubly disappointed worse napoleon was portrayed inaccurately as boorish and impulsive someone should have reminded j phoenix that he was no longer playing the riddler
Nov 27 2023,negative,my review of napoleon  the movie was too long 25 hrs w unbelievably wooden dialog weird scene progressions eg implied sex scene followed immediately by a newborn too much warring and unconvincing love story between napoleon and josephine how could a movie of all these talents resulted in such a fiasco i feel sorry for the actors whom i normally seek out it was painful to sit thru i see a lot of movies but this one was horrible
Nov 27 2023,negative,its a great movie if you want to go to sleep 
Nov 27 2023,negative,real bad  movie about some boring under table games with hes wife or other trash    he could take over all russian army in austria  what lol they even managed to false fact   not about hes genius  theres so much to tell and they told the worst story ive seen
Nov 27 2023,neutral,good performances but did not feel or recognize the magnetism between napoleon and josephine  that fell flat  battle scenes were terrific but too many and the movie was too long  great dramatic scenes and photography of hoards of soldiers  butsome magic was missing from this very interesting and dramatic story
Nov 27 2023,negative,awful the script was non existent and jaquin pheonix was miscast
Nov 27 2023,neutral,the two main reasons i decided to see napoleon are ridley scott and academy award winner joaquin phoenix  while i do not think the movie is terrible by any means both scott and phoenix have done better  i just feel napoleon has too many problems for me to give the movie a higher rating  the first for me is the most obvious  all of the characters speak english  i found that hard to get around  also i felt the movie to be rather flat  there for some reason or another seemed to be no life to the movie  thats surprising with a movie with many battle sequences which i will admit were all very well staged  when the movie ended i said to myself that was ok  that pretty much sums it up for me  as i said napoleon is not terrible but i have seen better
Nov 27 2023,negative,this movie fails at all levels to entertain or represent history in any meaningful way
Nov 27 2023,positive,costumes and sets and battl scenes were outstanding    movie was slow and too long
Nov 27 2023,positive,great effects  close enough to historical accuracy to be educational  phoenix is great in everything
Nov 27 2023,positive,while scott leaves the audience with little to no questionsimagination regarding what kind of individual napoleon bonaparte wasthere cant help but exist a feeling that a key ingredient was missing almost as if it was so close to being a pure masterpiece as much of scotts work lives up to be     this biopic does leave the viewer feeling full and satisfied of war and battles and at the same time tickles the fancy of those who seek to know the intimacy and inner workings of the historic french emperor
Nov 27 2023,neutral,pretty battle scene shots  thats about it
Nov 27 2023,negative,big disappointment  often could not hear dialogue characters not always clearly defined kind of boring actually thought about leaving
Nov 27 2023,neutral,didnt like the color tint of the movie maybe they chose the yellow candle tint so the backgrounds would look real
Nov 27 2023,positive,fabulous i predict an oscar sweep brilliant acting wardrobe set dressings propsevery bit of this film is a masterpiece of course joauquin phoenix was amazing we absolutely loved it
Nov 27 2023,negative,a whole lot draggy  couldnt get into this one at all
Nov 27 2023,positive,movie was excellent joaquin phoenix was excellent i would watch napoleon again
Nov 27 2023,positive,brilliant film by two stellar actors and directed by a master
Nov 27 2023,positive,great cinematic performance a ring was excellent and movie moved quickly despite its length
Nov 27 2023,positive,stunning on a grand scale gripping on a character level great acting oscars coming sir ridley deserves a gold statue for this incredible epic with humor and pathos
Nov 27 2023,positive,joaquin was too old for the young napoleon
Nov 27 2023,positive,an excellent portrait of the napoleonic era with some exciting if not entirely accurate battle scenes and excellent performances by joaquin phoenix and vanessa kirby if you enjoy historical epics this is a truly great experience grade  a
Nov 27 2023,negative,gratuitously bloody and depressing we hated all the characters and left early
Nov 27 2023,positive,i am not a huge fan of jaquin but i think he did a good job here  battle scenes were brutal  not glorified  even though was pretty long seemed to be hard for them to fit everything they wanted to tell  more sex scenes than i expected to be shown
Nov 27 2023,neutral,as always ridleys eye for detail and visuals is second to none especially in the battle scenes    the script was bad  slow plodding and who cares  maybe because of the writers strike very disappointing in the overall plot
Nov 27 2023,negative,i wanted to be exiled from this movie  the actors seemed bored  the movie was a slog couldnt figure out what it wanted to be love story or war movie  the battles were as fast as napoleons love making sessions  what a waste of time its movies like these that make me rethink going to the theatre
Nov 27 2023,positive,it was ok not what i expected from phoenix some history was off but it was ok
Nov 27 2023,negative,big expectations from scott met by a big flop it looks like the screenplay was written  by the daily mirrors most french hating ukip type of  journalist i want my money back one thing is clear to me scott should stay with scifi genre history is not a thing for him
Nov 27 2023,positive,first of all i love joaquin phoenix and he did not disappoint in this film he always adds some thing to his characters and vanessa kirby isnt she a stunning actress i gotta tell ya the love affair between them really hit home for me loved it
Nov 27 2023,positive,well done good acting and almost like a history lesson
Nov 27 2023,negative,very narrow focus completely botched
Nov 27 2023,positive,loved this movie  great story  ignore negative reviews and see it
Nov 27 2023,negative,i read the bad reviews but was really hoping they were exaggerated i really wanted to see this movie so i ignored them and took a chance lesson learned 
Nov 27 2023,negative,this movie was a sad disappointment many years of napoleons amazing and epic history crammed into that it felt like they completely brushed aside the historical accuracy for an epic block buster dont get the wrong the visuals are outstanding but the story is a wet fart
Nov 27 2023,negative,very disappointing    this film feels like the answer to the corporateboardroommeeting question okay lets make some money how can we shoot some cool battle scenes and make that napoleon guy look like a fool devoid of any virtues or nuance
Nov 27 2023,positive,sound could have been a lot better  sound quality seemed to improve in 2nd half  great battle scenes soldiers fighting dying but gore was not paramount  covererd breadth of napoleon with some insight about his character and flaws most esp josephine fixation
Nov 27 2023,negative,first movie that i think i ever walked of confusing boring disjointed movie overly focused on the bizarre relationship with his wife disappointed
Nov 27 2023,positive,napoleon in my humble opnion is an amazing product of ridley scott that has sadly bad pacing as i found the most enjoyment of the film in the battle sequences but they were far too short for my liking and all the other scenes were a tad too longi feel like if the battles were shown more in the film it wouldve been betteralso very funny notein the scenes were napoleon tries to make an heirhe thrusting like a rabbit jumping and it is hilarious
Nov 27 2023,positive,educational and well acted but lingered too long the lighting was dark making it hard to see the music was good
Nov 27 2023,positive,more of a love story than a historical movie sets costumes and music are all great
Nov 27 2023,negative,i was looking forward to this movie and booked 2 weeks in advance i would not recommend
Nov 27 2023,negative,hard to follow not entertaining
Nov 27 2023,positive,great cinematography  great actors and actresses
Nov 26 2023,negative,the cinematography was very well done the story was disjointed and jumped around also key moments in history were missed another disney disappointment
Nov 26 2023,negative,it spent way too much time on josephine and not near enough time on how he won his military victories
Nov 26 2023,positive,great production and special effects
Nov 26 2023,positive,i think as a piece of art this movie should be evaluated as an epic spectacle heavy major motion picture event instead as a perfectly accurate history class documentary and in that category it perfectly delivers
Nov 26 2023,negative,voted half star for the acting  the rest was a mess
Nov 26 2023,negative,this movie should be called josephine not napoleon the biggest grief i have with this movie is that it is simply boring the second one is that it is incoherent youre just shown some scenes from napoleons life without context and explanation of any relation between them the third is too little battles and the battles shown dont give any justice to the scale and brilliance of the actual ones
Nov 26 2023,negative,this should have been an original scripted series on apple   they tried to covered his life on 2 12 hours  this should have been 10 hours  a lot of plots un answered  unfinished storylines  there were jumps in history and battles sec es that were confusing  weird ending they ran out of time joaquin was amazing
Nov 26 2023,negative,there is a disconnect between the history and the romance cinematically the battle scenes were well done but i didnt think it effectively gave insight into the subject
Nov 26 2023,negative,this is only the second movie i left before it was finished although the cinematography and costuming were stunning the story and script were flat dull and choppy i expected something far more captivating considering a dynamic historical figure was the centerpiece napoleon had nothing to say its bad enough it was made with an englishspeaking cast pedestrian i also found it confounding that everyone but napoleon had a british accent why i prefer to read captions to feel im seeing something that resembles reality mon dieu
Nov 26 2023,negative,a boring mess that doesnt give any insight into napoleon or how he could inspire such devotion
Nov 26 2023,neutral,biased far from any historical framework and based on the ego of the director who has already accustomed us to misinterpreting the story but using his fame
Nov 26 2023,negative,unwatchable  what a mess the pacing is all over the place it jumps around without context maybe unless you come in with some expertise of the history of france   its randomly quirky attempting to be funny with odd action scenes  honestly i had to leave after 2 hours i couldnt take it anymore
Nov 26 2023,negative,thought it was a slow burn kind of movie expected so much more as im a big fan of joaquin phoenix  script wasnt strong or engaging
Nov 26 2023,positive,more battles and less personal lifewould be better
Nov 26 2023,positive,lots of gory battle scenes but not much character development
Nov 26 2023,negative,i was very disappointed with this film despite the assembled talent on display i didnt think it a fair or convincing depiction of napoleon or his wider achievements beyond the battlefield i could forgive that on artistic grounds if i had enjoyed the film but i did not i found it far too long confusing frustrating irritating and ultimately boring it was the first film in a long time i have wanted to walk out on
Nov 26 2023,negative,the film respects nothing of napoleons history  the characters have no charisma the settings are not serious the characters have no charisma the battles are ridiculous
Nov 26 2023,negative,great battle scenes but movie didnt feel like it had a good flow a war would start or stop with little to no explanation was hoping it would be better than it was so much history left on the table 
Nov 26 2023,positive,i thought the movie was candid entertaining   the actor is incredible vaulting over the obligatory vulgar parallels of todays dissatisfaction and humanizing a polarizing populist there is an implied intermission when one realizes they are culpable is this beatification of a man poisoned by god himself
Nov 26 2023,positive,another beautiful ridley scott movie huge battle scenes and sweeping views story was a little thin and of course everyone is raging on historical inaccuracies but overall a fine cinematic experience made to be seen on the big screen
Nov 26 2023,positive,i thought the characters couldve been a little deeper but overall it was a good movie
Nov 26 2023,negative,completely shits on any semblance of accurate history
Nov 26 2023,negative,biggest disappointment of the year obviously scott miss a few history classes
Nov 26 2023,negative,terrible to long couldnt hear voices
Nov 26 2023,negative,this was an unbelievably disappointing movie for a figure with such an actionpacked life i expected the runtime to be just right if not too short however they glossed so quickly over every exciting element of his life and focused so heavily on every monotonous boring detail that by an hour in youre already waiting if not begging for it to be done   you would never know the man who the film is named after is the protagonist and you certainly dont leave with any understanding of why he is known hundreds of years later as a brilliant military tactician and leader there was little to like about the protagonist leaving no one at all to root for in this pointless waste of film i wanted the protagonist to be likable and i wanted to feel conflicted about liking him at the very least i wanted to respect him no positive feelings are evoked in this disaster of a movie  my wish is for everyone to save their money and not reward this absolutely pathetic attempt at a historical biopic
Nov 26 2023,positive,great graphics and the text was really well written
Nov 26 2023,positive,beautifully crafted the jump from the retreat from russia in 1812 to nbs abdication in 1814 was jarring as it skipped the disastrous battle of leipzig in 1813 which was the beginning of the end for the emperor a few moments of battle action and some narration or onscreen text would have bridged that gap movie moved quickly through its 238
Nov 26 2023,negative,an hour too long and at times very slow paced
Nov 26 2023,negative,wasted potential napoléon story is way better and way more complex thant just a guy that wants to have sex with his girl
Nov 26 2023,positive,amazing performances and the battle scenes were epic
Nov 26 2023,negative,i love history i was not impressed the  movie waterloo should have been rereleased to accommodate the rubber bayonets and drama and no mention of the thief of europe and sense of death the napoleonic wars were all the computers and nothing more coulda been done i had high hopes but was disappointed
Nov 26 2023,positive,best to see on the big screen loved it
Nov 26 2023,positive,the performances were very good loved the special effects during the fighting scenes the cinematography was great
Nov 26 2023,positive,this movie was historic and acurit
Nov 26 2023,negative,a charmless soulless powerpoint presentation with a grossly miscast joaquin phoenix that not only gives you no littletono incentive to keep watching it but also twists and mispresents history along the way so much so in fact that one couldnt be blamed for thinking this was an intentional parody of the titular character rather than an attempt at a historical biopic    the battles were well crafted with plenty of practical effects and genuine effort but its nothing groundbreaking or original unfortunately since the film utterly fails to make you care or feel invested about whats going on i was indifferent throughout most of the battles    i also felt like napoleons relationship with josephine couldve been more fleshed out there was clearly a complicated lovehate relationship going on but it was more of a tell rather than show actually pretty much everything in the movie felt like it couldve been more fleshed out    as it turns out ridley has the answer for us  and a 4 hour cut of napoleon is coming to appletv next year unfortunately in order for a movie to be saved by its extended ddition like kingdom of heaven was you must first have a solid foundation  and napoleon has nothing even resembling that i cant imagine another 15 hours of this bore
Nov 26 2023,positive,action scenes and the history
Nov 26 2023,positive,this is the way movies should be made no car crashes or super heros just people history and great cinematography accompanied by great music and acting sir ridely has his masterpiece and if the world has any justice napoleon should sweep the awards bravo
Nov 26 2023,negative,what has happened to ridley scott the he could make such a terrible film  it didnt seem to know it was about there was no conceivable plot just jumping from one battle to another so that we could see bodies being blown up no analysis of his battlefield tactics no explanation of what was happening in europe no idea of what napoleon was like as a person all with clicheridden dialogue that prevented joaquin phoenix from giving even a half decent performance why did he take this part on is he short of offers agnès poirier said its inept crass and boring couldnt put it better than that
Nov 26 2023,negative,they had ample time to get it right but what went wrong it felt as though joaquin phoenix wasnt fully committed to his role there were moments in the film where he appeared lost in thought almost as if he was thinking did i leave the stove on while he undeniably possesses great acting skills something seemed off my anticipation for joaquins impressive acting was left hanging the editing played a substantial role in the movies downfall ultimately failing to do justice to joaquins talent the combination of subpar editing and a lack of clear direction i feel put him at a disadvantage the music score too felt out of place within the movie contributing to an overall confusing experience    in summary the film came across as highly disjointed burdened by an excess of unnecessary and overly extended scenes these moments dragged on to the extent that the actors seemed idle lacking in drama or emotion one could almost sense the actors wondering is this scene ever going to end are the cameras still rolling furthermore crucial historical scenes were abruptly cut short diverting attention to an abundance of battle sequences some of which were somewhat immature in their graphic depiction the poorly written acted and shot sex scenes further detracted from the films overall quality    its important to acknowledge that while battle scenes are indeed an integral part of napoleons story along with his personality and sexual prowess they were unfortunately poorly captured in this film    in the end this film stands out as one of the most poorly assembled productions ive seen in quite some time while im well aware of napoleons historical significance this movie proved to be a catastrophic attempt at telling his story despite my admiration for ridley scott it appears that historical storytelling may not be his strong suit
Nov 26 2023,negative,really disappointed to have watched a napoleon with so little charisma
Nov 26 2023,negative,this film is one big failure ridley scott is known for good stories  and the movie napoleon doesnt even have a shred of story in it    its an unrealistic roast of napoleon embracing his genius on the battlefield and showing him as a small and complacent man who accomplished nothing it culminates in the battle of waterloo whose portrayal is an absolute contradiction of what the battle looked like in history    i do not recommend it at all a pathetic film
Nov 26 2023,negative,i am very disappointed with this movie napoleon bonaparte is portrayed in a petty way often in a way that ridicules him what should be the foundation of this film ie battle scenes the strategic genius of the great leader and battle planning constitute a small part of the film the great potential of this topic has not been used it doesnt even come close to what we remember from gladiator
Nov 26 2023,positive,i would have liked more character developmentexplanation and a little less bloodshed    it is not easy to understand the complexity of the personality although the film does a pretty good job of promoting some theories of napoleons motivations
Nov 26 2023,negative,the only good thing about watching this movie was that it made me want to know napoleons real story cause even though i dont know much about him i know this movie aint it
Nov 26 2023,positive,not too bad just far away from being a masterpiece
Nov 26 2023,negative,a crime against history and truth its embarrassing
Nov 26 2023,positive,impressive and brutal battle srquences are unmatched by a dull script  as always joaquin phoenix goes all in on the psychology of his character but his american accent standing alone with the british accents of the rest of the ensemble by the way hollywood french people dont sound british does nothing to aid a disappointing reunion with gladiator director ridley scott  he must have lost his british accent some time between then and now
Nov 26 2023,positive,slow is spot decent movie not bad not great
Nov 26 2023,positive,jaoquin and vanessa stole the show overall a fun ride im not sure how historial accuratw it was but visually it was great
Nov 26 2023,negative,disjointed and appallingly boring even ignoring the baited directors cut i could find little compelling in this directionless slog
Nov 26 2023,positive,i have mixed feelings about this film the sets costumes and war sequences were spectacular but the script seemed incredibly weak because the dialogue was largely uninteresting throughout the film joaquin phoenix seemed a bit out of his element and was overpowered by the character he was playing despite these shortcomings it was still an enjoyable movie 
Nov 26 2023,negative,please stop giving ridley scott money the man has forgotten how to tell a story after two and a half hours youll walk out of the cinema dumber than you walked in who was napoleon and why was he always at war i still dont know but i still give it two stars just for the cool costumes and practical fx it does at least look good
Nov 26 2023,negative,unless youre a history buff do yourself a favor and stay home super boring a real snoozer
Nov 26 2023,positive,excellent movie great action scenes shows a little bit of what a military genius napoleon truly was overall good movie
Nov 26 2023,positive,i enjoyed the movie i learned a lot about napoleon and i think the movie was just the right length
Nov 26 2023,negative,boring made it through half the movie and left
Nov 26 2023,positive,this movie was really good a little boring but definitely a movie to watch
Nov 26 2023,positive,i wkon that some part of the story in the film is never happen in the real story but for me this movie is a massive win
Nov 26 2023,negative,omg this film sucked like about as much as it was possible to suck with all the money and amazing sets and costumes and talent they threw at it its like a teenager wrote it in an afternoon with only the history channel for prep im sure nobody involved ever read war and peace or any other related lit certainly they didnt understand what the french revolution was about or why napoleon rose to power or what people were fighting for as europe was convulsed by war for decades joaquin phoenix appears to have modeled his napoleon on amélie rather than one of historys great generals and statesmen and no modern filmmaker seems to have the slightest grasp on cavalry tactics if youre gonna make a film about napoleon at least try to get a battle right the most compelling character is josephine and indeed the film seems to be mostly about a dysfunctional romance  recommend instead dino de laurentiis waterloo 1970 starring christopher plummer as wellington it only treats the 100 days but its one of the few great period films esp the scene at the duchess of richmonds ball
Nov 26 2023,negative,the movie had too many artistic portrayals  some of the scenes were well done but most were almost herkyjerky  an example was austerlitz  the battle was done at the pratzen heights not on a frozen lake the russiansaustrians retreated through a marsh with ponds not lakes  ridley scott could have shown a better depiction of the moscow retreat because the cossacks harassed the french all the way back to the neiman river  napoleon left the march to return to paris via a large sled   so if you just wanted to see  kirby and phoenix together it might be an ok movie but other than that its a meh  could have been better
Nov 26 2023,positive,thought it was good though it did fly through the russian campaign
Nov 26 2023,positive,rating is relative to films that have been released as of late definitely refreshing to see a solid release this year performances are great
Nov 26 2023,positive,visually stunning for every moment then all the acting was painfully human and raw capturing emotions of the time era fiercely the film also had maximum gritty tones of noir drama and thrilling action packed suspense
Nov 26 2023,negative,should have named the movie josephine
Nov 26 2023,neutral,its a reasonably good movie but the battle scenes are too long and tedious we get it they didnt need to overdo it so much worth watching but it could have been so much better it needed more substance and less action
Nov 26 2023,negative,the movie was more focused on the romantic aide of napoleon wich most of it isnt even true very boring and disapoiting
Nov 26 2023,positive,would have been better as a miniseries despite the long running time it felt rushed i did not see why napolean had so many followers they did not develop that story very well a few times probably to reduce running time joaquin phoenix had to straightout tell the audience why he should be respected saying that he wins battles so that should earn him something they tell when they should show so it falls flat kind of breaks the 4th wall not a bad movie just flat
Nov 26 2023,negative,i was hoping for an interesting and action packed story telling movie about his life
Nov 26 2023,positive,loved it  any movie that tackles the napoleonic wars will be incredibly difficult to capture in a 3 hours but this film managed to capture the spirit of the battles and history very well  this is a historical film so i can see why some might pan the movie specifically because they are not familiar with or interested in that period of history  if you are you will love this film  joaquin phoenix is fantastic the filming locations were epic
Nov 26 2023,negative,impressive photography and set pieces but to follow the story one has to have quite good knowledge of french history   which i  do not  otherwise it becomes very confusing and all very much of a muddle  who is fighting who in the battle scenes    who knows    anybodys guess i suppose   disappointing in many respects
Nov 26 2023,negative,poor acting poor character development   lighting poor overall a sucky movie trying to think of something good but cant  skip the movie and save your money if this is the kind of movie to expect from apple the skip anything apple makes 
Nov 26 2023,negative,to watch napolean 2023 being portrayed as someone who speaks in a whimsy almost inaudible voice for almost three hours was almost a cringe fest the 1960 waterloo film with rod stieger playing the emperor of france was at least a 6 on the 1 to 10 scale the 2002 rendition with christian clavier as the master of europe was utterly fantastic a supreme commander who dominates every military situation and sizes up everyone in his path with acute acumen napolean the statesmen loyal to the french revolution and those around him isabella rossellini in the 2002 version as josephine was equally captivating to watch as opposed to the common almost street trick vender of kirby of which was vulgar and obscene  napoleans last words were josephine on the lonely island of saint helena in 1821 a love like that cannot be trampled upon by the latest installment of the one of the worlds greatest military commanders scott has not only failed miserably but has also let those around him fail as well due to his misguided and ignorant portrayal of the leader of the french empire napolean never faltered in his loyalties he instilled an unbridled espree de corps due to that personality trait scott has fallen off the cliff in this latest film not worth the time and effort it took to make this monstrosity and certainly has lost a base loyalty
Nov 26 2023,negative,like a lot of the other reviews i thought the plot was all over the place and didnt come full circle on any one plot point you come out of the theater hungry for napoleon information because the the movie did a poor job of trying to explain who this man really was it was less of an epic biopic about a legendary commander and more a sad romantic drama with a few visually exciting but confusing battle scenes
Nov 26 2023,negative,at times this movie is ridiculous napoleon is in exile on the island of ste helena off the coast of africa  he wanders around unshaven wearing his military uniform emperors sash and all his medals seriously the waterloo battle is totally butchered too  napoleon was beaten by von blucher who arrived with 50000 troops just as napoleon turned the tables on wellington some of the really big events in france were skipped over entirely napoleon bonaparte  for all his faults  was a superb technocrat ridley scott turns napoleon into an action film punctuated with fullyclothed bonking scott has made great movies this isnt one of them
Nov 26 2023,negative,disappointing to say the least weak script nonexistent character development disjointed editing not one of phoenixs better efforts this director needs to either hang it up or take on less ambitious projects
Nov 26 2023,positive,an amazing movie with storytelling acting and directing
Nov 26 2023,positive,action scenes are done so well napoleon is so real was not expecting it to be as funny as it was
Nov 26 2023,negative,it lacked plot cohesion and sagged at times to relate the scenes with josephine to the outstanding historical events  there was no mention of other major battles like jena and no references to major reforms that napoleon spread across europesuch as the metric system the napoleonic code and the civilian system of justice
Nov 26 2023,negative,horrible i cant believe i wasted money or my time on it
Nov 26 2023,positive,people just complain too much
Nov 26 2023,positive,it was epic and looked great  some historical myths were unfortunately maintained such as the pyramids in egypt being fired upon in fact they were not and napoleon was off fighting a defensive war and therefore couldnt have been at marie antoinettes execution  there were other anomalies but overall i liked the movie although long but how do you make a short one about napoleon
Nov 26 2023,positive,great action scenes beautiful scenery great acting
Nov 26 2023,negative,this movie is horrible easily bottom 10 movies i have ever watched dont let the trailers fool you just 120 minutes of repetitive bland cinema
Nov 26 2023,negative,terrible i didnt know much about napoleon before watching the movie and thats still the case now after sitting through that dross the pacing is horrible scenes jump all over the place with no real link between the battle scenes are good but not enough to save the rest of the movie
Nov 26 2023,positive,loved the cinematography and battle scenes but i felt it was disjointed and lacked the development of nb character and complexity  phoenix did an ok job with nb but josephine stole the show
Nov 26 2023,negative,way tooooooo sexual there were about 4 sex scenes in the movie 3 with napoleon quietly and quickly ramming himself into josephine and one with her affair intimately having an intense scene with her there were also only 3 battles 2 of which he lost where are the 66 battles he won not in this movie
Nov 26 2023,positive,a lot of action information about napoleon  i did not know and the acting was superb
Nov 26 2023,positive,overall i liked this movie the performances from joaquin phoenix and vanessa kirby carried the movie during its long runtime and focused on what i think is an overlooked legacy of napoleon the battle scenes were amazing in set design and choreography the costume design of everyone in the movie especially the soldiers of each army was extremely well done in terms of being historically realistic moments at austerlitz and waterloo were well adapted for the camera still there were many other moments that were more of a myth rather than fact when talking about pacing it felt that it would flash between scenes and years too quickly and as a result the movie largely overlooked the war in spain and battles in germany in 1813 and 1814 a disappointment during some of the battle scenes was that some bothersome cgi was used which took me out of the experience but all in all this movie was a good watch
Nov 26 2023,negative,the movie was long and slow some parts where confusing while others where missing closure the acting was excellent but we found the movie nothing more than a slow moving history lesson
Nov 26 2023,negative,this movie sucks the entire movie was related to josephine and their toxic relationship ship
Nov 26 2023,negative,i wanted more history not a love story costumes were fantastic scenery was great but i didnt like the movie
Nov 26 2023,negative,story line was all over the place unnecessary sex scenes acting was meh
Nov 26 2023,positive,did not love it did not hate it either all things considered the movie was feh
Nov 26 2023,positive,the battle scenes were very good the story line was ok the setting was very dark and dismal i would give it a c
Nov 26 2023,negative,ridley scott has created many outstanding movies that excite and entertain the audience while telling a fabulous story sadly napoleon is not one of them its a procession of snapshots of battle bed and plotting that fail to weave together to entertain us or give us a sense of the period the man or his achievements scott tries to cram in too much and as a result most of it feels too fleeting and inconsequential
Nov 26 2023,negative,i wanted to walk out of the theater and go watch a youtube video about napoleon i think i would have learned more and be more entertained the moment i saw no one spoke french i realized the movie would suck
Nov 26 2023,negative,one of the worst movies i ever saw it was so boring that i just wanted to leave the cinema but i didnt want to wake up the sleeping people next to me
Nov 26 2023,negative,terrible in every way i dont really know who this movie was for if you knew the overall history you could follow along but got exactly zero new information about napoleon or his time they literally limited almost every campaign to a single scene or a voiceover narration of napoleon writing letters to josephine if you did not know the history well youd be completely lost because there is zero consideration about timing save a few incomplete title cards  im amazed how a great production can be this bad
Nov 26 2023,positive,visually stunning but the connection to the characters are lacking
Nov 26 2023,negative,terrible movie joaquin phoenix acted like he was mentally incompetent and was waaaaayyy too old to play napoleon this was not at all about the real bonaparte it was weird offputting and boring a few of the battle scenes were great but again they portrayed napoleon as on the sidelines and barely involved whereas in real life he was a brilliant tactician and leader if you must see it at least look up some real facts first 
Nov 26 2023,negative,instead of the great biopicture we were promised we got a 2hr mess about napoleons relationship with josephine with inhuman dialogue and graphic sex scenes that added nothing it was rittled with so many historical innacuracies and overlooks that it might as well have been fiction the only redeeming thing about this movie was the action and battle sequences     overall not one of ridley scotts best works and not one joquine pheonixs best performances a disappointment
Nov 26 2023,positive,cinematography was awesome actors knocked it out of park
Nov 26 2023,negative,ridley scott has lost his touch this movie jumps all over the place its doesnt show napoleons character really at all and too much focus is on his cheating wife and his pathetic relationship with her i cant blame joaquin phoenix he has to follow the director this was a waste of time and opportunity for joaquin phoenix and more importantly historic movie fans
Nov 26 2023,negative,after seeing the trailers i wasnt expecting much but it was even worse than i expected awful in every sense of the word
Nov 26 2023,negative,worst movie of the year less war more sex
Nov 26 2023,negative,a middling experience barely kept afloat by photography and scenography but ultimately unsatisfying the writing is severely lacking with a napoleon that feels indeterminate and pointless  and maybe that was the aim of scott but in that case i wonder if we needed a movie about napoleon in the first place
Nov 26 2023,negative,not a good movie  not coherent   for instance what happened to his son   disappointed in this ridley scott movie  was expecting more from director and phoenix
Nov 26 2023,negative,should have been labeled napoleon chases josephine with some battle action  more a romance movie than anything imho battle scenes pretty well done but that is it plus the commander of a 150000 to 300000 man army does not lead saber charges
Nov 26 2023,positive,despite its 25h runtime the narrative feels rushed and choppy battle scenes are epic unsurprisingly for a ridley scott film but the movie needs more charismatic performances and characterdriven storytelling to truly deliver
Nov 26 2023,positive,great scenes and giant production but very bad editing feels like theres no main point trying to get everywhere but not reaching in any aspect good performance in terms of acting waiting for the directora cut for some salvation
Nov 26 2023,negative,there were no redeeming qualities except my free small popcorn no plot no character development only a couple of scenes highlighting napoleons creative military strategies
Nov 26 2023,negative,long boring and imprecise
Nov 26 2023,negative,napoleon is a major historical figure and i was hoping to see a good historical movie  i think there could have been a much better actor than phoenix playing napoleon a couple scenes were trashy and unnecessary
Nov 26 2023,positive,the movie was long but interesting  at times i did find it difficult to hear what they were saying
Nov 26 2023,negative,i do not know any more about napolean than i did when i walked in sure the battles were ok especially the lake but the timeline getting to them leaves me without a sense of the times a good history movie puts you in that time and you learn from what is happening it was bad actually the love story was no love story i would want to be in she was cold and it seemed as if he was the only one in love waste of two and a half hours one of jaquins worst performances
Nov 26 2023,positive,although we were excited to see it we fell asleep on different occasions during the movie  it was very boring in several spots and the dialogue was difficult to understand  also very choppy scripted movie 
Nov 26 2023,negative,all that money in the production with such a bad scriptwhat a waste
Nov 26 2023,negative,it was very shallow and missed on telling a historic person while the battle scenes were very good while the presentation of napoleon was very poor and full of made up history no mention of his establishing the first civil laws that still carry his name  napolianic code the sec scenes were gross and did nothing to add to the story napoleon was great military leader beloved by his troop and french people to make him a shallow joke is shameful and made the movie shallow and not interesting waste of money
Nov 26 2023,negative,the entire movie was painful i even fell asleep
Nov 26 2023,positive,joaquin phoenix gives an outstanding performance i enjoyed this film but this movie does not have to be 2 and a half hours long
Nov 26 2023,positive,too long personal life was all about creating an heir sex scenes battles were fine but no real dialogue to explain why they were happening other than to conquer countries  i would wait for when it is streaming
Nov 26 2023,positive,despite a few inaccuracies this was a solid entry from phoenix and scott intense battles and great dialogue
Nov 26 2023,positive,great actions shots but a little too bloody
Nov 26 2023,positive,historical piece so dont expect something different  joaquin phoenix did an excellent job with his character as did all the actors  terrific cinematography was well done
Nov 26 2023,positive,great acting by phoenix and kirby not getting the love it deserves
Nov 26 2023,positive,well done historical movie details his life including military summary love life and downfall  maybe a little long but all movies are heading this way
Nov 26 2023,positive,i believe making this movie maybe half an hour longer to at least make an attempt to explain why napoleon is considered good bad or controversial by some would have made it a five star movie as far as i am concerned but that is just me most people dont watch movies just to acquire knowledge about historic leaders but i do
Nov 26 2023,positive,the acting was tremendous
Nov 26 2023,positive,if you are expecting a broad analysis of napoleons many achievements as well as his failings this is not the movie for you scott focuses on two aspects of his protagonist  his lust for war and his lust for josephine the crowd and battle scenes are gory and wonderfully executed the scenes with josephine are passionate  you have been warned if you treat this movie as a mere glimpse of the man you will thoroughly enjoy it if you already know a lot about napoleon and seek historical accuracy you should probably give this a miss
Nov 26 2023,negative,there was nothing i liked about this movie and i found it boring
Nov 26 2023,negative,not recommended for people who do not know much about napoleon yes he was somehow crazy but he was also a genius a strategist and a visionary politician in a troublesome france and world nothing in the movie relates his unusual brilliance but he is portrayed as a tyrant mostly dominated by his wife   so very disappointing 
Nov 26 2023,positive,this movie was amazing i never thought napoleon could be actually be so hilarious what a great movie
Nov 26 2023,positive,well acted good costuming and set design engaging
Nov 26 2023,negative,so much anticipation so much disappointment how can two of historys most interesting  people be so boring   some parts of the battle scenes were exciting but i felt the intensity was lost by the need to continually try to show the enormity of them
Nov 26 2023,positive,mucj better than wahat the critics would              much better than what the film critics would lead you to believe although it seemed drained of muc passion  it did show napoleon as a monster the adolph hitler of the early 19th century
Nov 26 2023,positive,some good acting but the movie dragged at times  more beaty and passion would have been nice
Nov 26 2023,positive,great acting too much blood
Nov 26 2023,negative,too much sex and bullshit about relationship not enough battle and action
Nov 26 2023,negative,missed out on so much of the history to filibuster so much time wasted the battle scenes were great but no real depth into the amazing strategist he was
Nov 26 2023,negative,epically boring and exceptionally undramatic  a masterclass in how not to make a movie
Nov 26 2023,negative,while there are some very cinematic shots here austerlitz and  well here everything else felt like i was back to that special blend of snoozing and mild horror at what was being said when my lit teacher was explaining that the curtains in the poem were blue because the author had had stale bread for breakfast that day even the coronation was dull but maybe you can at least learn something about these tremendously important times for europe and some of the most powerful countries in the world for the next century to come nope you dont get that either lets end on a battle and body count with no historical perspective whatsoever even the french dont deserve such a movie
Nov 26 2023,negative,it was terribly boring and they tried too hard to make napoleon seem goofy once i realized i still had an hour left i walked out of the theatre
Nov 26 2023,negative,this film follows the recent yet tired new hollywood tradition of tearing down everything that is western  this movie comes off as a hitjob on napoleon and a poor one at that  it would have been fine to paint napoleon as a tyrant or a violent ego maniac but instead scott decided to portray him as a lucky weak lovesick puppy who happened to be a good general  it tries to do too much and what it does it does poorly
Nov 26 2023,positive,battles were badass rest was mediocre
Nov 26 2023,negative,very disappointed dont waste your time and money on it i dont care the actor has a 42yo face when hes 24 as long as you tell me a good story sadly i dont see what story it wanted to tell napoleon is world famous and great in history the movie didnt show it neither talent nor ambition its not even a moving love story only had some love scenes that totally lack of imagination the war scene is ok but with the current technology and the lord of rings scenes created about 20 years ago its not even impressing
Nov 26 2023,positive,it kept me entertained
Nov 26 2023,positive,joaquin phoenix was perfect as napoleon amazing costumes scenery battle scenes storyline was absorbing but not very believable
Nov 26 2023,positive,i liked all of it great movie very historical
Nov 26 2023,negative,boring seriously boring to much of the relationship and not enough of the battles he foughtwhen it was the battles they were not that impressive except for the one
Nov 26 2023,negative,a complex figurereduced to a soap operawithout a storythe important things arent therethe story written by an ignorantfor an audience with no memory  look at waterloo by sergej bondarchuk 1970 this is a film for a historical figure
Nov 26 2023,positive,this movie seems to be made for those with at least some knowledge of napoleons life id recommend studying his life before viewing the film for a better experience
Nov 26 2023,negative,jps acting was horrible napoleon didnt even have a french accent he just sounded like some bored american guy there was no zest anger or charisma to his charactereverything napoleon was
Nov 26 2023,positive,do not listen to the negative reviews take this film for what it is not for what people believe it is lacking this film is an amazing gorgeous sweeping epic adult story of a complicated man and time in history i learned a lot and enjoyed every minute of it i am not taking the film as historic gospel thats not what non documentary films are for but it is now a jumping off point to do research read a book expand my mind further this harkens back to the days of pre comic book pre cgi or whatever the ridiculous fake ass sht dominated hollywood films  and its so wonderful go to the theater support this film maybe it will help hollywood to grew some balls and bring back real adult films this one is headed to the oscars and however many this picture wins they will all be well deserved
Nov 26 2023,positive,not completely factual too much killing
Nov 26 2023,positive,big film telling a big story well cast great battle scenes kept us entertained for the whole two hours and 40 minutes
Nov 26 2023,negative,too jumbled not focused on history rather focused on a love story about 30mins in total of battles and 2 hours of a very one toned love story with bit of history that goes to fast to understand what just happened they are trying to fit in 30 years into a 28hr movie with a love story that takes center stage    all of it is the exact quote ridley scott used to describe the history of the movie and he used some of it over looking napoleons conquests in europe we sit and watch all of it meaning his love story with josephine only history you get a glimpse of is the coup russia and waterloo he skips spain where in real life napoleon installs his brother as king this should tell you exactly where the directors focus is sad had high hopes
Nov 26 2023,positive,soundtrack good good acting
Nov 26 2023,positive,it was really excellent
Nov 26 2023,negative,overall felt disjointed it feels like they forced story to be a movie when it wouldve benefitted from being a show scenes just happen and you dont really know whats going on theres one scene in particular where he wants an heir but it plays out like it happened in a single evening the story just kind of forces itself no real natural progression it goes from him being a general to a emperor in a matter of minutes no real character development also me and the friends that saw are all in agreement that the film feels under exposed everything looked dark
Nov 26 2023,negative,i walked out of the theater 1hr into the movie  i couldnt take it anymore  i wasnt going to subject myself any further to the horrible representation of this historic figure and times  everything about it was a painful low in my opinion of ridley scott directorship  the way the movie transitions from scene to scene left me feeling like i was watching it in fast forward  it was weird  joaquin phoenix who i love in joker probably my top 20 movies did a disappointing job this time around  all the rest of the actors sucked  the cinematography sucked  it all sucked  you wanna burn 20 for fun  light it on fire  thats the way i felt as i stormed out of there
Nov 26 2023,positive,it was interesting learning the inside story of napoleon
Nov 26 2023,negative,horrible movie the lead performance is laughable just a real dud  dont waste your money
Nov 26 2023,negative,good actors horrible chronicle of the person though could have focussed on more of the victories and events in geopolictcs of the time instead meandered around his relationship with his wife meh
Nov 26 2023,positive,it jump around to much and focused more on napoleons personal life then his military achievement and social reforms
Nov 26 2023,positive,it could have been called josephine
Nov 26 2023,positive,continuing with the great streak of films like dune or top gun maverick napoleon is a true cinematic experience it is highly recommended that this be enjoyed in the cinema the bigger the screen the better     majestic impressive at times violent and at times romantic mr scott tones down his heavy touch a bit and presents a very interesting story    without a doubt one of the best films of the year that stands out for its photography and music the fight between this and oppenheimer is going to be interesting
Nov 26 2023,positive,i taught it was a good movie and ive seen some of the reviews but i guess everyone has different taste because the movie wasnt boring to me  and im probably going to watch it a second time
Nov 26 2023,positive,very slow moving story without enough context for why battles happened
Nov 26 2023,positive,really good  disregard the history snobs and such that act like this is horrible go see it youll love it
Nov 26 2023,positive,this is a beautiful movie confusing at times in the beginning but overall very compelling
Nov 26 2023,positive,liked the way jp portrayed napoleon
Nov 26 2023,negative,story telling was nonexistent acting was disappointing long and boring take on a very interesting time in history
Nov 26 2023,neutral,if you are looking for a sweeping epic love story with spectacle you will enjoy the film in that sense it is a beautiful film    however if you are looking for historical authenticity napoleon falls way short    the battles for austerlitz and waterloo fall just short of fabricated in terms of actual events  as others have said regardless of napoleons brutality if you are going to make an epic about one of the most influential figures in history    honor the history
Nov 26 2023,positive,i really enjoyed this movie overall i just wish some parts were more accurate recounts that some important characters didnt leave without explanation and that the filming style didnt dull down the colour however the movie was very entertaining and captured some of the main moments of napoleons history id recommend watching if you like period movies
Nov 26 2023,negative,napoleon by ridley scott is like if you asked a british dude whose great great grandad got killed in the revolutionary war to make a biopic about george washington and its as good as you can imagine that would be joaquin was wasted on that movie had some decent battle scenes and not a completely terrible movie but kinda a joke overall imo 610
Nov 26 2023,positive,great movie about a man and his love and about the cruelty of any war
Nov 26 2023,positive,very well scripted and acted highly recommended a few bawdy sex scenes i wouldnt let my children see this movie
Nov 26 2023,positive,i saw some of the reviews and was turned off but decided to trust my own instincts   so glad i did  thought it was a great film beautifully shot terrific acting fascinating informative and entertaining the score was pitch perfect  if this doesnt win a few academy awards then nothing out this year deserves an oscar  ignore the pompous pseudointellects its a great film
Nov 26 2023,neutral,impressive battle sequences held down by a boring and borish portrayal of napoleon  one of the most fascinating and energetic personalities in the last few centuries  if someone does not know already they would understand and know little about the man  good and bad  from this movie  except his repulsive and erratic behavior toward josephine
Nov 26 2023,neutral,not enough character development humor drama it wa a big bleh good battle scenesthats about it
Nov 26 2023,positive,it was entertaining  a little long  a little violent   but necessary for the story  joaquin phoenix was great 
Nov 26 2023,positive,i honestly dont the hate although i am very happy to see the audience not going safe i wished it was for a differant movie in my opinion but its just so refreshing to the see the audience finally not going easy on a movie that came out in theaters that is not a horror the exrocist remake and winnie the pooh blood and honey are the only theater releases that audiences didnt like every other movie audiences hated came out on streaming example being peter pan and wendy which i totally agree with now napoleon is the only non horror movie that came out in theaters and is a movie alot of people are familiar with so although i think it is decent this movie deserved the bad audience score it got
Nov 26 2023,negative,i was very excited to see this movie this movie left something to be desired it neither told the story of napaloean as a conquerer or as a tactician  well nor the underlying love story plot the battle scenes did not do napaleon justice even though they were the best part of the movie the story could have been told in 2 hours max there were many unnecessary scenes as well that did not move the story along or really tell ad any value
Nov 26 2023,positive,finally a history moved on napoleon that i believe told a true story
Nov 26 2023,negative,too slow confusing didnt provide historical details
Nov 26 2023,positive,i wish this was three films with similar run times
Nov 26 2023,positive,liked the main star but  the battles got old even though they were well done the romance between napoleon and josephine was not believable
Nov 26 2023,negative,feel like phoenix could have done so much more with this character characters who show up and then disappear with no explanation
Nov 26 2023,negative,too hollywood not historic enough too much focus on sex and violence failed to address his military genius
Nov 26 2023,positive,is good movie but it could have been better and is disappointing
Nov 26 2023,positive,biographically accurate with some hollywood flare thrown in to make a good movie good acting acrosstheboard and unfortunately very accurate and therefore bloody battle scenes
Nov 26 2023,positive,great history lesson  not enough to connect with in the interesting dialogue
Nov 26 2023,positive,the cinematography was great but such a miss on the storyline would more historical context have been that difficult
Nov 26 2023,positive,i liked the way it is a combination of historical facts almost like documentary and artistic work combined with humor and anecdotes   the cast was great
Nov 26 2023,negative,honestly this was one of if not the worst movie ive seen in years  there is no substance to it  there is no character development  napoleon was an exceptional student of history  he had a vision  he had a purpose  none of that comes out in the film  he took scholars with him to egypt and while there learned about and virtually professed to believe in islam  he wrote thousands of letters and attended to the smallest details  none of that comes out in this movie  and worse even what it does show is unbelievably boring  the 3 other people with whom i went all agreed  do not waste your time or your money  what a missed opportunity  shame on scott ridley
Nov 26 2023,positive,overall well done  a few holes in the storyline that could have been better addressed  joaquin performed at a high level
Nov 26 2023,positive,ridley scotts waterloo while the action scenes were exciting to watch and visually appealing the rest was relatively uninspiring the movie spent a large chunk exploring the relationship between napoleon and josephine but we walk away learning very little on them both
Nov 26 2023,negative,all in general was really bad the war scenes are not good the portrayal of his life is really bad and then all the graphic scenes didnt help at all
Nov 26 2023,negative,this film makes me wish that stanley kubrick had finished his decadeslong obsession with completing his own napoleon epicnapoleon is a shallow film that isnt nearly as entertaining as the last duel and lacks the complexity and depth of those characterswith one notable exception josephine as played by vanessa kirby great performance that added detail to a historical figure that i was only vaguely familiar with i immediately wanted to know more about herin contrast i frankly dont know what the hell phoenix was thinking other than to cinematically slander one of the giants of european historythis napoleon certainly wasnt the enlightenment on horsebackhistorical inaccuracies abound and while the battles are brutal and realistic they become repetitive without context and background information
Nov 26 2023,positive,another imersive cinematographic experience by ridley scott with brilliant acting work by joaquin phoenix napoelon surely has its downsides but theyre so little its just not fair to diminish the films score here basically i would have cut some of the cringe moments with his wife josephine which only made the film unnecessarily  long other than that the film is a masterpiece
Nov 26 2023,negative,literally terrible walked out after 50 torturous minutes
Nov 26 2023,negative,pretty garbage the costume design is incredible unfortunately the people wearing those costumes are almost as uninspired as the script the message is strong in this one
Nov 26 2023,negative,there is no story in this movie napoleon according to this movie had no friends no acquaintances no familyjosephine is a mystery we do not know anything about her movie moves from one battle to next without account of what is going on in france one second he is on side of republic  in couple of minutes someone who we of course have no idea who he is declares him a king i have seen many  a movies and though i like r scott this may be one of the worst monotone depressing movies i have ever seen napoleon doesnt say much he is silent figure in most scene you are warned
Nov 26 2023,negative,just horrible i kept waiting for it to turnall the way through it sucked
Nov 26 2023,negative,poorly edited film that felt like more of a clip show than a coherent narrative historical inaccuracies aside the depiction of napoleon doesnt match with how characters interact with him and the battles dont show any genius or intellect
Nov 26 2023,negative,it it so negative and there is nothing good winning over even in the movie and why would we go see a movie about a bad person we need positive movies
Nov 26 2023,positive,battle after battle looses its significance and visual value
Nov 26 2023,negative,this was really disappointing   there is no suspense or really much emotion brought out in the movie  its pretty dull overall  i enjoyed the acting performances although joaquin phoenix sounded like he was doing his joker voice too many times  the battle scenes are pretty grim but not enough to make you care about the outcome 
Nov 26 2023,positive,it was focused too much on the relationship between josephine and napoleon napoleon was greater than that relationship
Nov 26 2023,positive,id give it 35 stars if i could the movie dialog was very hard to hear for everyone in my group of 6 though we all enjoyed the story and as someone who studied history i was glad they didnt stray too far from our historical understanding of the events that were shown
Nov 26 2023,positive,too much of his relationship with josephine
Nov 26 2023,positive,it was similar to a hallmark drama napoleon was a strong commander during his time but this movie  makes him look somewhat weak in character
Nov 26 2023,negative,simply horrendous  joaquin phoenix is an excellent actor however the script was so poorly written that no one could turn this into a good performance in addition had the movie only focused on the battle of waterloo he would have been fine for the part however the movie jammed in 27 years in two hours and 30 minutes so he is just too old to play a 25 year old napoleon the movie lacked character development and historical inaccuracies abound if you love this period in history and have studied it even on a surface level you will walk away disgusted with the quality of this movie and whats disservice this movie did to this dynamic of a historical figure whether you like him or not
Nov 26 2023,positive,i was expecting more the rhythm is not great but philmography and potograph are amazing joaquín phoenix as always is great
Nov 26 2023,negative,i just left the theater in the middle of the battle of austerlitz i was waiting for this movie but to have napoleon saying mammamama to have sex and then say to his cheating wife that hes nothing without her was too much austerlitz his masterpiece  ruined so i left  terrible movie dont waste your time or money
Nov 26 2023,negative,went in expecting a movie portraying a man who conquered europe was completely disappointed with the direction a movie about a conqueror that focuses mainly on his odd love life i would maybe play this as background noise as i cleaned my house
Nov 26 2023,positive,a few cheesy moments seemed off in the movie but it was well acted and interesting
Nov 26 2023,negative,dark illlit screen picture not sharp  there is no historical context provided the viewer  you never know the why of anything
Nov 26 2023,positive,loved the battle scenes  very intense
Nov 26 2023,positive,truly liked this movie exposing his personal life vs is power life complex xharacter
Nov 26 2023,neutral,i expected so much more the script lacked slow build up and too shallow napoleon is such an interesting historical figure and they barely scratched the surface of many of the aspects of who he was battle scenes were good but even there lacked flow and complete understanding of the dynamics at hand way too much emphasis on his relationship with josephine and little attention to so many other aspects of his life i wanted to love it i am a huge ridley scott fan and yet the whole film had a dark and somber feel with slow moving scenes and didnt reel you into the story 
Nov 26 2023,negative,i am a ridley scott and joaquin phoenix fan and this movie is one of the worst for both how can you make one of the most exciting interesting life like napoleon so boring people were falling asleep there is not even a flowing story line it feels like a cut and paste i wonder if ridley scott watched his own movie the only plus is the battle sceens nothing else big disappointment
Nov 26 2023,positive,epic battles excellent joaquin phoenix and vanessa kirby amazing soundtrack  one of the best films of 2023  in 30 years it will be remembered as one of the best costume dramas ever made
Nov 26 2023,negative,very little content regarding script  epic battle scenes but they started to replicate each other as the movie progressed  felt nothing for the characters
Nov 26 2023,positive,excellent acting excellent cinematography excellent story   simply great
Nov 26 2023,positive,ridley scott finally deserves his award for best director napoleon is a cinematic masterpiece it embodies all the trials and tribulations of the first and last emperor of france  his desire to have an heir was only superseded by his desire for josephine an enjoyable epic done superbly by master storyteller ridley
Nov 26 2023,negative,youre better of satying at home if youve even the slightest familiarity with the history surrounding the life of napoleon youll be disgusted this is not the right way to critique a historical figure i get the impression that napoleons enemies showed him more respect than the makers of this film  waste of time watch or read anything else about him
Nov 26 2023,positive,better than i expected based on the previous reviews im happy that i watched the movie
Nov 26 2023,negative,its a beautiful film but not a good film
Nov 26 2023,positive,very interesting liked joaquin phoenixs performance i personally did not enjoy vanessa kirby as josephine between the hair style which did not look correct and the fact that she was just in mission impossible it was hard to get that suspension of disbelief other than that is was a bit too long probably could have cut 3040 minutes and had a better paced movie
Nov 26 2023,positive,theres a lot thats impressive about this movie technically strong performances but the script is a bit like a textbook and illustrates how hard it is to teach about these historical figures it also felt rushed this would have made a better miniseries where the story could have been fleshed out more
Nov 26 2023,positive,basically it was more of the story of napolean and josephine
Nov 26 2023,positive,napoleon is a fantastic epic the film does its best to cover as much as possible about napoleons life in just 2 12hours the cinematography throughout the entire film is breathtaking the battle scenes were some of the best that i have ever seen in a movie the relationship between napoleon and josephine was well done
Nov 26 2023,negative,horrible representation of napoleon in every way the actor playing napoleon just doesnt fit the character too old too british no charm no dialog delivery mediocre acting he might have won award in the past but this has been the biggest misfit for a role i have ever seen   even worse is the direction movie does not catch your imagination anywhere but what is more shocking is the crude emphasis on bedroom scenes with josephine and focus on josephine instead of napoleon i wonder if this movie was made to humiliate french and the real napoleon   could they have not chosen french actors speaking in english that would have added a touch of authenticity   there is none of genius who came out of nowhere and become emperor of france a battlefield tactician par excellence that you will find in this movie   movie spends 90 of the screen time on awkward crude and irrelevant relationships with josephine and his other wife   movie should have been named josephine if that   granted it is difficult to encompass everything napoleon achieve and his failures in a movie but there is not even a glimpse of it script is poor dialogs are poor editing is poor this is anything but epic   dont waste your money on this to call this movie mediocre would be a complement it is just horrible i walked out of the theater 23rds way into it
Nov 26 2023,negative,save yourself the money and dont see it it doesnt even try to break down or explain events it doesnt even attempt to show why he was such a brilliant general
Nov 26 2023,positive,exiting explosive fabulous highly recommended
Nov 26 2023,negative,i didnt care much for the movie it was dark  not very interesting to me
Nov 26 2023,positive,really nice the battles were epic and the dynamic between napoleon and his wife was very interesting although it felt like the movie was cut in parts to fit a shorter screentime so it is a little bit rushed in some places
Nov 26 2023,positive,we enjoyed the historical analysis some of the history may have been slightly over dramatized for hollywood purposes overall it deserves the mostly 5 stars that it has received in reviews
Nov 26 2023,negative,battle scenes were big character development was lacking  phoenix was monotone with two facial expressions  rest of cast popped on and off screen quickly  the great live story was actually pathetic and left audiences wondering what
Nov 26 2023,neutral,painful at times and too long  perhaps the film should have focused on a smaller part of napoleons life
Nov 26 2023,positive,great movie havent seen a movie like this in awhile
Nov 26 2023,positive,great battle scenes bit to much focus on the mad marriage but all in a great film
Nov 26 2023,negative,wow what a missed opportunity did someone kidnap ridley scott this was not up to his usual effort such a fantastic subject that could have yielded an oscar win and joaquin phoenix what in the world happened you looked disinterested in the role the only positive is that i now want to read more about napoleon to fill in the numerous questions i have following this 25 hour waste of my time
Nov 26 2023,positive,the cinematography was beautiful and joaquin is a tremendous actor yeti felt there was a lack  of historical depth in building an accurate and empowering portrayal of napoleon i was also bothered by the american accents throughout the movie  couldnt we have had french actors subtitles accents i felt myself checking the time and wondering how much longer this was going to be it just lacked staying power depth holding power it felt like you werent really aware that you were taking a massive part of history that many people are aware of and really trying to do it justice i really like to go to movies and just try and enjoy myself but i was expecting so much more out of this
Nov 26 2023,negative,only redeeming part was costumes and scenery and was so false when he is well documented
Nov 26 2023,negative,wow   the critics were right on this one
Nov 26 2023,negative,when a littleknown director makes a masterpiece its reasonable that a retrospective of their previous work might yield hidden gems the converse must also be true this film was a shambolic mess im now wondering how ridley scotts previous movies will hold up to rewatching     the most profound moments drew laughter from the audience the dialog was shockingly poor the plot disjointed and characterization juvenile napoleon was one of the most dynamic people in history he did bad things he did good things he did a load of truly remarkable things he lived through and shaped the most complicated period in european history he was duplicitous principled sometimes idealistic determined ambitious pragmatic and often conflicted he both saved and betrayed the french revolution ridley scott gives us a boothevillain clown he has a deficit of charisma is slow somnolent and confused by everything    i had expected something more like the character arch in citizen cane the talented energetic outsider rises to greatness but ultimately loses or destroys by his own hand all that he values     this was such a hackneyed lazy portrayal i am so confused why anyone would bother to make a movie about someone they neither like nor find interesting i assume scott in his 85th year was looking to tap undiscerning audiences based on both his and napoleons brand
Nov 25 2023,positive,movie was too long and dragged on at places acting was superb
Nov 25 2023,negative,runs along about the pacing of a documentary wo the narrator giving you important context did not seem to have a solid narrative arc or character building that made you care that should be expected of an epic film     sadly the whole thing was desaturated and washed out leading to scenes that couldve been cinematic triumphs simply grainy and drab
Nov 25 2023,negative,the movie is basically a best of napoleons most important moments in life and a positive aspect was that time went by quickly while watching the movie    however there is a lack of a clear storyline context and there are so many unlogical scenes and historic inconsistencies i wont be able to list them all but some were    the scenes that play in the 18th century show 19th century fashion music and furniture it felt like napoleon met pride and prejudice and even in the later part which is early 19th century we have late 19th century fashion    why did the choir sing in german when napoleon walked down the church after the coronation i thought he was the french emperor and the coronation was in france    what happened with marie antoinettes hair and why did she wear her own clothes at the execution and what on earth was napoleon doing there    how did the english get into the rescue boats so quickly seconds after their ships were attacked    i could continue with that endlessly but ill keep it at this of course it is normal to have some historical inconsistencies in a movie however there are so many it makes me think that no one actually cared about the topic at all even pirates of the carribbean has better costume and equipment eg and that is a fictional movie based on a disney theme park    napoleon is famous for his military skills yet what we mostly see is just running into battle thoughtlessly and even shooting at the pyramids which doesnt make any sense a good portion of battle scenes also appears to be cgi the only strategist that i could find in the movie was the duke of wellington    the storyline with josephine oh dear they say they love each other but there is no chemistry even the scenes when they are intimate mostly look more like its a duty for them that has to be done not an expression of their love    i am not sure which story ridley scott wanted to tell us and looking at the movie it doesnt look he knows that either
Nov 25 2023,positive,josephine and napoleons love story was beautiful admist the war i laughed several times on how they bonded it also does reflect and speaks how napoleon never raged war but in the end good movie
Nov 25 2023,negative,i lost interest within the first 10 minutes and spent the rest of the time staring at the corner of the screen waiting for it to end what a monumental bore of a film
Nov 25 2023,positive,subtle this movie focuses on the relationship between napoleon and josephine it highlights napoleons strengths  use of geometry in battles negotiating etc  and weaknesses  lack of empathy etc in essence the weakness of this movie is the casting i would have preferred to see gary oldman christian bale or daniel daylewis in the lead
Nov 25 2023,negative,probably the most boring movie i have seen in the last 10 years everything is filmed in a dingy gray the acting is flat the storyline just nothing to get excited about i think ridley scott just got a big check from apple to produce a movie about napoleon and did as little as he could
Nov 25 2023,negative,i went meteron in san francisco and proceeded to auditorium 8 i waited through the previews and its screened wish lol i left and have to see it at another time so i cant rate till later date
Nov 25 2023,positive,excellent movie great footage of battles
Nov 25 2023,positive,action was good but it just didnt seem to keep our interest
Nov 25 2023,positive,phenomenal cinematography costumes and battle scenes  and napoleons relationship with josephine was interesting  he put his country before her and his country dumped him  but overall the film and phoenixs performance felt flat and lacked personality and life the film possibly tried to cover too long a time period everetts turn was clownish and silly still an epic movie
Nov 25 2023,negative,the films portrayal of napoleon by ridley comes across as a caricature focusing solely on power dynamics and overlooking his significant contributions to democracy legal systems and the decline of monarchy its a perspective that lacks respect for the historical figure and might be viewed as insensitive especially to the french audience given the omission of napoleons broader impact on society
Nov 25 2023,positive,unnecessary sex scenes and language they didnt use in that era
Nov 25 2023,positive,beautifully done movie  excellent cinematography as youd expect and the love story between napoleon and josephine was perfectly portrayed  will go see it again to take in the beauty of the film
Nov 25 2023,negative,walked out of the movie boring no chemistry between characters and very choppy wait for it to come out on streaming dont waste your time or money
Nov 25 2023,negative,sorry but i dont understand how this movie can be hyped so much one of the greatest european statesmen and field marshals for better or worse reduced to a semiautistic horny peasant bully torn between his calling as a ruler and the toxic relationship with his first wife which even mutated to the driving force behind his withdrawal from egypt and his escape from elba    nice film if you wanna see a a teenie drama in the setting of old france but if youre interestet in a portrait about this great person of european history you will be disappointed without any trace of mercy but i can comprehend why this film is rated so good especially by british and american viewers
Nov 25 2023,positive,i enjoyed the entire movie and loved the music intertwined throughout the story
Nov 25 2023,positive,i dont understand the negative reviews i thought it was clever visually impressive and had depth i also learnt more about history winner
Nov 25 2023,negative,i enjoyed the movie as a whole its not like i wanted to walk out however it felt rushed and slow at the same time also there was a serious lack of characters i cant tell you the name of any characters all in all its a decent watch but dont go in expecting a classic
Nov 25 2023,positive,worth seeing in theatres
Nov 25 2023,negative,its like whoever made this took its research only from a comic book for five year olds about napoleon its a very poor and disappointing movie nice action scenes though but fails epicly in depicting a complex historical figure its not asking big questions its not even trying sorry but time wasted
Nov 25 2023,negative,this movie fails as historical drama as it misses every possible aspect of napoleonic era but worse is that it misses to tell a story i walked out of cinema having no idea what this movie tried to tell me joaquin phoenix as great as he is as an actor was miscasted to play young soon to be emperor fallen in love with older josephine in fact only part of the movie worth watching is an actress playing josephin vanessa kirby she captured her perfectly
Nov 25 2023,positive,the goodbattle scenes very well done the badtoo much josephine felt a lot of historical events either rushed through or skipped all together was anticipating the movie could have waited and streamed at home
Nov 25 2023,positive,it was ok the action scenes where  meh
Nov 25 2023,negative,a ball slappin bad time
Nov 25 2023,negative,napoleon is quite an interesting chap so interesting in fact that in the 1920s a silent film omnibus was created about him that remains brilliantly entertaining a century later sans dialogue quite how you can turn his life into such a set piece borefest in the 2020s is a bit perplexing the canon use in the warfare scenes aside theres absolutely nothing positive about this biopic even the usually excellent joaquin phoenix doesnt appear particularly interested in raising his performance above the mundane it shouldnt be possible to cram his life into two and a half hours and yet the film still felt overlong basically i didnt like it watched it in haymarket odeon
Nov 25 2023,negative,total disaster napoleon is portrayed as a lunatic rather a great military leader  the historical accuracy is poor the battle scenes are not up to the expectations of a ridley scott film    the movie tries to be an epic historical film but it is instead a movie to humiliate napoleons great legacylost between historical caricature and a love story and the pathetic whinings of an aging joaquim phoenix stuck in his role as commodus in gladiator many years ago
Nov 25 2023,positive,j phoenixsive loved him in other roles acting wasnt appropriate for the role otherwise great battle scenes
Nov 25 2023,negative,as a history fan it was painful to watch this train wreck
Nov 25 2023,positive,the details involved were well portrayedacting was seamless and full of life
Nov 25 2023,negative,picture quality was dark with complete lack of detail battle scenes were actually boring no chemistry between the main characters
Nov 25 2023,positive,fire like moscow in december of 1812
Nov 25 2023,positive,excellent movie although its a tad bloody the battle scenes got long but understand that they were there for realism
Nov 25 2023,negative,it is no gladiator gray slow confused  these are the three words is use to describe this film if youre looking for a historical fiction with good character development and pacing look elsewhere these guys scott and scorcese need to either hire people with the power to say no or recapture their ability to storytell in under two hours
Nov 25 2023,negative,movie is about sex mostly and not much about war its not a historic portrait its straight up porn
Nov 25 2023,negative,if gladiator was 9 out of 10 then this was a 5 out of 10  a disjointed  abbreviated snooze fest  sorry i really wanted to like it but have almost forgotten it 4 hours later
Nov 25 2023,positive,beautifully filmed looking forward to the 4 hour cut
Nov 25 2023,positive,i think this is a must see movie especially if youre into napoleonic history the acting battles and storytelling was amazing i have to admit tho this films portrayal of the man himself made me question what sources the director used for his story in history he wasnt like this in my opinion and i am scared that someone with no knowledge about the real napoleon wil believe he really was this big of a coward but that said this is a hollywood movie and not a documentary so some of it can be forgiven and i have to give credit to the battle scenes they were on point and so entertaining a must see movie
Nov 25 2023,negative,incredibly hard to follow do not recommend gory vulgar yet no idea whats going on in the movie definitely dont watch it with your parents gross
Nov 25 2023,negative,this movie sucks the writing is bad and the acting is worse
Nov 25 2023,positive,a wonderful movie
Nov 25 2023,negative,this is a mess of a film scenes are disjointed and characterizations feel completely disconnected from any historical fact main characters have little to no agency so you basically never get to know them or care for them it is simply a series of events and the characters are merely set pieces in the action one of the worst movies i have had to endure in the past 10 years maybe next time ridley will actually do the research instead of looking at some damn pics to prepare to act as director good grief i mean they got the date of birth wrong go figure
Nov 25 2023,positive,great historical story
Nov 25 2023,positive,saw this for the first time on the 25 nov wasnt blown away by it having been looking forward to it for some time i was more than a little disappointed i knew i was a bit tired yesterday so thought i would give it another go this afternoon the benefit of an unlimited card i was glad i did because it definitely hit the spot the second time around and has earned that extra star a far more subtle film than i originally expected  more focused on the relationship between napoleon  josephine than his attempts to do a land grab across europe time well spent by me this afternoon
Nov 25 2023,positive,i liked the movie it is about time napoleon got a movie where we can see some of his great battles i big scale ridley scott show us this but not only the movie is af lovestory josefine napoleons wife and napoleon is connectet when he meets josefine he is on the rise and when she dies he meets hes waterloo no napoleon without josefine   napoleon is a big and complex character you cannot show all sides of him in one movie ridley scott focus on his wife and his biggest batteles  it works for me but as allways with movies parts of the full tale is missing but again napoleon deserves and epic in big scale and that is what he got here  on apple  tv a 4 hour version will be realised i will try to watch that to see what part of the story they inclued or give more time to   go see it
Nov 25 2023,positive,not that accurate but a really great watch
Nov 25 2023,negative,definitely a villain in ridley scotts mind disappointing for me more like a powerpoint and moral preaching with side with royalists no mentioning impact of napoleonic code and strategic mind only weeny crying baby for josephine and cold hard killing machine so many scene time for british commander of battle of waterloo no idea who direct napoleon but after saw the movie i know its a british who direct it
Nov 25 2023,neutral,i felt like this movie was told in bullet points it felt guarded and from what i understand the best thing about this movie is the war strategies 
Nov 25 2023,positive,visually stunning  joaquin phoenix is the bomb
Nov 25 2023,negative,its like ridley and david scarpa decided to leave all the juicy bits  of a juicybit historical figure  out of the movie dull story dull acting needlessly dark cinematography no ridley scott magic maybe theres a directors cut coming
Nov 25 2023,positive,i like epic historic films and had high hopes but it felt shy the movie felt like it was both rushed and dragged on for almost 3 hours at the same time i think they just tried to tell too long of a story and cram it all in the action scenes were good but seemed short if you like this sort of genre it was decent but not great
Nov 25 2023,negative,long  dull too much dysfunctional relationship and not enough neoplean battle strategist
Nov 25 2023,negative,too many long bloody battle scenes thought it would be a more intimate telling of napoleons personal life conversations between him and josephine lacked depth and substance questions left unanswered what ever happened to his son were they on the island together  did he stay married to his 2nd wife confusion with him becoming a king he found the crown on the ground put on his head then took it off guess he was already an emperor
Nov 25 2023,positive,i thought joaquin phoenix was miscast as napoleon he usually plays odd people and he played napoleon as a bit goofy battle scenes were great but as usual too long this played out as battle after battle i enjoyed the scenes with josephine better as well as the scenes where he is dealing with the other leaders in the revolution
Nov 25 2023,positive,spectacular but bit of a potboiler
Nov 25 2023,positive,i loved this movie thoroughly entertaining i am surprised by the lackluster ratings and reviews the performance choices and writing were at times off but allinall i would highly recommend this movie the battles scenes are amongst the best i have ever seen in filmartistic and clear to follow i think a longer version would work even better
Nov 25 2023,negative,beautiful yes but very clunky storytelling the great love that supposedly existed between them was nonexistent as was the reason how he actually became emperor among other things i really wanted to love it but it was meh
Nov 25 2023,positive,great scenery and costume design lots of battle scenes i would wait for it to come out on streaming service
Nov 25 2023,negative,as a history person with a focus on napoleons era im not sure who this movie was for but it wasnt me technically in terms of the cinematic quality a good movie earning the 2 stars but story wise garbage
Nov 25 2023,positive,one of the best movie i saw these years
Nov 25 2023,positive,great acting the mix of british and american accents was a bit strange 
Nov 25 2023,negative,did not quite plumb the depths of dial of destiny but pretty bad phoenix poor little context  eg wellington appearing out of nowhere peninsular war  what was that really looked forward to this but was really disappointed by quite how bad it was
Nov 25 2023,negative,way too long and boring each war seen looked like the last one cold loud and dreary i wish i hadnt wasted my time
Nov 25 2023,neutral,as much as i love joaquin phoenix i have to heave a disappointed sigh at napoleon  he seemed wooden unsympathetic and clueless regarding foreplay  while the battle scenes are amazing the characters are incomprehensible what made napoleon so brilliant how was he obsessed or was he by joséphine  how did he motivate  there just wasnt any depth at all to the characters and i left feeling cheated
Nov 25 2023,negative,great cinematography and amazing battle scenes cannot make up for a poorly written and badly acted film yeah im talking to you joaquin phoenix this film should have been a masterpiece for director ridley scott instead mr scott used hundreds of millions of dollars and three hours of my viewing time for his personal vendetta against napoleon  disappointing
Nov 25 2023,positive,solid performance by joaquin phoenix
Nov 25 2023,negative,scenery was nice  i think the way they were trying to show case napoleons ego and phoenixs acting skills missed the point  yes they did capture a lot of the intrigue an revolutionary spirit in france at that time and how he played it to get power ie the  story was fine but just done very uninteresting  was phoenix replicating his role in gladiator  i hope he has more range in his actin ability do not want to see a megastar labeled as a character actor thats why i give it one star and would be hardpressed to recommend it to anyone  other than watching the austerlitz battle scene a couple more times to check its accuracy i would not spend the time or money to watch it again    thanks for listing all the minor character and actors  they helped capture a lot of the real tension in paris at that time  did they have to leave out lafayette even when they showed how the royalists tried to make a comeback    ps was the high ranking africanamerican officer suppose to be alexandra dumas  did not follow the credits at the end because i really wanted to leave the theater  he was on the campaign in egypt but not in the coup in paris
Nov 25 2023,negative,too long too much of the same thing
Nov 25 2023,negative,holey smokes what a crapfest all ridley scott had to do is make a movie about one of the most famous humans of all time with enough history written about him in thousands of books he delivered a stupid madeup unwatchable pile get ridley of this scott guy send him to elba
Nov 25 2023,negative,this movie was the most boring movie ive ever seen  i didnt think it was ever going to end  the story was disjointed and the characters were played with little emotion  there was nothing and no one in this movie to be interested in  too bad as it could have been a really great story for a movie but this failed miserably
Nov 25 2023,positive,cinematography was great the actors were great as well but the movie was not great
Nov 25 2023,positive,i loved it
Nov 25 2023,positive,i wouldnt go see this movie if you are looking for the truth about napoleon this movie is as far from reality as you can get no french accent too long battle scenes yes good acting and lots of action so if that is all your asking for good overall i enjoyed it but was disappointed wanted more reality
Nov 25 2023,negative,terrible movie wanted to walk out but tried to give the movie the benefit of the doubt definitely a waste of three hours 
Nov 25 2023,positive,a wonderful film  it would be even better as a multiinstallment film to dive deeper into the life of napoleon  although just short of 3 hours the viewer will be left wanting more  joaquin phoenix delivers a masterful performance and is deserving of a second oscar
Nov 25 2023,negative,unfocused far too long with unnecessary scenes and a failed attempt at a satirical rendition of who napoleon was   it was the first time ive walked out of a movie
Nov 25 2023,negative,napolean was touted as a great epic film  however sitting through this ever long film was a disaster  the battle scenes were the same as those from the 1950s and 60s epic films  although a bit of special fx is now used  what a total waste of joaquin phoenix talent  his portrayal of bonaparte was flat wooden and stilted  the guns  those long rifles  were more active than he was  the estranged marriage was not in the best of historical events and it also was the only time there was a glimmer of emotion from phoenix  i adore the talent of jp and felt that his portrayal was director induced and he did not have the chance to truly portray this historical character  what a waste of money for a film that was flat and lackluster   a true holiday time disappointment
Nov 25 2023,positive,hard to review  it is a really well made movie but you better know your french history to make sense of it  i was hoping to learn more about the man  it does not touch on how he became so loved the actor has no charm which napoleon must have had to become such a leader  you feel nothing towards the actor he just goes from scene to scene  it defiantly could be a great movie had they added a little more historical information insight into the man and less of josephine drama
Nov 25 2023,neutral,weird unauthentic biopic phoenix was also miscast
Nov 25 2023,negative,absolutely terrible wanted money back action scenes were good though ill give them that
Nov 25 2023,negative,dont bother i want 3 hours of my life back wait till it comes out streaming 
Nov 25 2023,negative,can i rate in the negative  yuck  so boring
Nov 25 2023,negative,long more of a love story than anything else expected something different
Nov 25 2023,positive,i was so excited i see the movie  knowing the history and eventual fallout from failed campaigns   i was hoping to see more action    turned out to be more love story than action adventure    lowering expectations may allow for this movie to be more enjoyable
Nov 25 2023,negative,terrible  portrayed napoleon as an awkward looser just focused on josephine  while completely going over his brilliant military tactics and decisive battles that he won  chronological timeline was very wrong

Nov 25 2023,positive,just meh i typically love ridley scott movies no one does battle scenes better but this was a rather bland depiction of one of the greatest military commanders in history and i was a bit bored hard to put my finger on it exactly but i was disappointed not enough to walk out but i did check my watch when there were still 45 minutes remaining in the film
Nov 25 2023,negative,it is a very good film visually but with a terrible script
Nov 25 2023,negative,an hour into the movie i asked my friend is it just me or is this movie terrible  it only went downhill from there way too many personal embellishments with very poor story telling and almost no detail about why the revolution was happening this movie was slow dull and utterly lacking a cohesive story     battle scenes were just ok lots of blurry fast moving cheap camera tricks not what i expected for a movie of this scope  might be worth a stream but this isnt worth a trip to the movies
Nov 25 2023,negative,my wife and i were very disappointed in the movie after much anticipation about 90 of it focused on napoleons effort to have a son through josephine his inept sexual prowess and lacking tactical command  his strategic insight and leadership were ignored in order to portray him as a buffoon romantically and socially leading to the deaths of those who followed him i do not recommend this movie not even on streaming
Nov 25 2023,positive,i saw the reviews and expected a bad and boring movie instead i got a great experience consistent with what ive about him in andrew roberts napoleon the great as i understand the bulk of the reviews are centered on his relationship with josephine which seems odd for a person of his grandeur nevertheless his relationship with josephine is consistent with what he looks like in his letters to her which you can find in the aforementioned book so the movie is great definitely recommend
Nov 25 2023,positive,it was a solid film but it was misrepresented by the trailers the trailers pushed a narrative on napolean as a general and emporer wheras the film focused on him and his wife had the trailer done the film justice then the rating would of been higher but it was not the film i turned up to see
Nov 25 2023,positive,battle scenes were very authentic relationship with josephine was not what was expected
Nov 25 2023,negative,missed opportunity was expecting much more
Nov 25 2023,neutral,it was ok was expecting more i had diarrhea towards the end of the movie so i left and tended to that
Nov 25 2023,negative,editing was terrible
Nov 25 2023,negative,absolute garbage dont waste your time or money i walked out halfway through this movie is complete trash 
Nov 25 2023,negative,a huge disappointment on too many levels  with all the vital material available in history and in casting you are left with a flat pasty empty drama  no connection of characters or relationship of why they existed  the set design was lost in the overload of violence  ridley scott what were you thinking
Nov 25 2023,neutral,it was long wondering too much material to cover in a short time sex scenes not necessary
Nov 25 2023,negative,waste of 3 hours joaquin phoenix making funny faces and noises is not acting why we have to endure endless fully clothed sex scenes is beyond me     if you know the actual history of this period the insanely grotesque mockery onscreen is truly painful to witness   even the grand battle scenes are cut with lugubrious repetition but they are a sort of sideline in this film to the completely pointless love story as if you told the story  of ww2 from eleanor roosevelts pov could be interesting but shouldnt be sold as an epic
Nov 25 2023,negative,dont waste your time and money  i had so much hope for this movie the previews made it seem like an actionpacked epic it ended up being a disjointed slog with uninspired dialogue and a glacial pace vanessa kirby as josephine was the only interesting character but even she didnt have a decent script to work with it was her expressions that gave her character life  it was so bad we left after an hour and a half
Nov 25 2023,positive,exposes the perverted life of the so called elite and why it was so important the united states be successful
Nov 25 2023,positive,visually the movie is epic unfortunately it is not great story telling it seems to attempt to cover too many events in a very truncated way with abrupt transitions and inspires no allegiance to any character plays more like a very long trailer than a conclusive story
Nov 25 2023,negative,didnt not tell the accurate story about napoleon
Nov 25 2023,positive,napoleon is a noteworthy historical epic that falls short of its full potential
Nov 25 2023,positive,great talent great battle scenes somehow it just did not entertain me as historical epics usually do
Nov 25 2023,positive,fluid impactful and good to watch film joaquins interpretation is sensational
Nov 25 2023,positive,historic inaccuracies such as napoleon and wellington never met
Nov 25 2023,positive,it was action packed and somewhat reflected history the costumes were fabulous
Nov 25 2023,positive,who cares what french critics think great job hollywood usa
Nov 25 2023,neutral,i do like the actors but the movie was just mediocre and long i forgot i i like feel good movies better
Nov 25 2023,positive,my wife and i went to see this movie and really enjoyed it  we have been talking about the history of napoleon and the movie for hours after the movie  it was great to see a movie like this on the big screen today i feel like there are less movies like this  it had an interesting romance layered in with battles and complex history   i cant stop thinking about what it was like in those times and napoleon is a fascinating person really fun movie
Nov 25 2023,positive,great historical movie
Nov 25 2023,positive,the through line of the story is very choppy so the viewer is often left wondering how the characters got where they are  didnt especially love either lead performance though the critics seem too  even with all the editing i read they did its still much too long
Nov 25 2023,positive,joaquin phoenix was too old and they made him act stupid
Nov 25 2023,negative,dont know much about history  after reading so much on the history of napoleon bonaparte i felt duped after watching this movie i deeply craved to see daniel day lewis play the role of napoleon in fact i cried he would have transformed this film i loved joaquin phoenix in gladiatorhis acting was ingenious however in the movie napoleon he suffocated the military genius of one of the worlds greatest leaders and left the film lifeless he looked much too old for the part of a young emperor and played the role poorly the movie showed us some of what napoleon did but nothing  of who he really was it was aa american soap opera filled with lust greed  and power and an insult to france
Nov 25 2023,positive,loved the amazing and large scale cenematography with adherence to historic fact attention to detail sweeping vistas and realistic and massive action scenes
Nov 25 2023,neutral,it was off putting how weird they made napoleons character
Nov 25 2023,negative,this was truly terrible there was zero chemistry between napoleon and josephine the side characters were barely introduced and had no impact the dialogue was slow halting and boring the battles were few and far between and you guessed it boring   no romance no charisma no tactical genius please save yourself the time and money
Nov 25 2023,positive,good battle scenes but they focused on josephine and napolean and the love story really didnt work in this story suppossedly on apple tv there is a 4 hour cut of this film later or some sort of extended dvd the film was long and joquin phoenix speaks english in film no accent the strengths of the film are the acting costume design and battle scenes but the love story and the length make the movie worth a stream the film jumps around the timeline alot worth seeing if u like history or epic battle scenes but i wish it focused more on napoleans military tactics if the film was all battle scenes and focused less on the love story it would be better still good acting from joquin and vanessa kirby worth seeing for the cinematography but may bore some due to length the full 4 hour version probably shows more of the history id recommend a rent or stream thanks enjoy the film
Nov 25 2023,negative,the writing editing acting cgi and directing were all bad  the costumes were good but costumes dont make a movie  everything else was awful  i only wish i could give it zero stars
Nov 25 2023,positive,brilliant i find it shocking the ratings are so low if you are with the mob perhaps you will not get it but even so its unlikely great performance and i am not a fan of any actor cgi of horses was pathetic as usual so for me thats going to earmark it for this time its way better than oppenheimer 
Nov 25 2023,positive,ridley scott shows hes a really good director but the story isnt deep enough they cover some big moments in napoleons life but it jumps around without explaining things well if you dont know much about napoleon already it might be confusing if they dug deeper into the story it could have been a great movie right now its more about looking good than telling a great story
Nov 25 2023,negative,slow and tedious movie i am amazed on how they managed to screw the history of napoleon with such boring production joaquin phoenix is not a good fit at all save some time and money and do not watch this
Nov 25 2023,positive,the bloody gruesome chaos of war is aptly portrayed in the battlefield scenes of this movie however except for toulon there is a real disconnect between the main character and those scenes and that disconnect reverberates throughout the movie a dislikeable character with few if any redeeming qualities victimizing those around him   a complex period quickly rushed through between scenes of copulation and battlefields
Nov 25 2023,negative,the trailer was a lie there is no epic sweeping war film there is no passionate love film maybe 30 minutes of clumsy and quite poor battles scenes that are more fiction than historical and often only serve as a background scene for the narration of some subpar love letters the rest of the screen time is split between napoléon and josephine sitting silently in rooms either alone or together and an admittedly amusing light comedy about a pair of brothers bumbling their way to the top outside of the rather pathetic waterloo scenes the set and costume production values and were excellent
Nov 25 2023,negative,loved the theatrics around it the story though was not enjoyable
Nov 25 2023,negative,very disappointing  the film is not at all what the trailers suggest and i cant understand why there are people who think the film is good  napoleon is a simple and dry series of events without depth or meaning  it feels like sitting in history class and being presented with facts chronologically that are presented so briefly that the viewer cant develop an ounce of feeling or connection to the characters  so i simply dont care what happens in the scenes  even the battles arent good and feel inconsequential and unspectacular  whether napoleon wins or not doesnt matter because napoleons motivation and background are not explained to the viewer  in addition some of the biggest battles like dresden are not even shown  between the events the relationship with josephine is talked about which often degenerates into comedy and portrays napoleon as a funny emotionless guy  i could add a lot of negative things here but the bottom line is save your money and time for the film because i have rarely sat in the cinema more bored and have rarely left the theater more disappointed
Nov 25 2023,positive,movie was so good i dont know why bad reviews are coming dont miss this underrated epic
Nov 25 2023,negative,one of the biggest disappointments i can remember film should be called napoleon trys to get his wife pregnant absolute honking movie
Nov 25 2023,negative,long disjointed boring
Nov 25 2023,negative,this movie is an insult to napoleon and the french in general
Nov 25 2023,positive,as a huge napoleon fan this didnt disappoint the battle scenes were amazing and detailed and napoleon had the level of humour you would expect from his famous character all the key characters were in the film robespierre talleyrand general blucher from the prussian army everyone i have read about  ridley scott gives napoleon an insecure funny cute personality the casting was spot on for him and josephine
Nov 25 2023,negative,had to get out of the theatre the movie was terrible
Nov 25 2023,positive,kind of boring and too long
Nov 25 2023,negative,this movie is a bad joke gross caricature with very little historical accuracy the plot line is confused and disconnected ridley managed to turn a controversial fascinating complex character into a bland boring uninteresting film  its an insult to french history and to the historical biopic film genre cant believe he dared premiered it on paris i bet the french audience wasnt amused
Nov 25 2023,positive,learned some historymultiple scenes just didnt have enough action and it could have been condensed it was missing more there could been more in this film so much emphasized on napoleons romance and marriage i wasnt impressed
Nov 25 2023,negative,more of a story about josephine than napoleon
Nov 25 2023,positive,as a visual spectacle this is superb   the pace and visuals are epic and i lapped up this movie  but if youre looking for any insight into the character this isnt the movie youre looking for  still breath taking
Nov 25 2023,negative,the movies  itself was not sharp hd the scenes were too dark dull and appear out of focus now for the movie itself it seemed rushed i recent read an autobiography on napoleon that and it was 900 pages thats how long the author took to portrait the life of frances most famous person  napoleons epic life with all its good and bad sides is better suited for a miniseries on apple tv
Nov 25 2023,negative,slow and boooooring
Nov 25 2023,positive,i absolutely loved it and so did everyone in my group it was just gorgeous visually in imax and the time flew by great battle sequences as well
Nov 25 2023,positive,tells story of napoleon  well done educational  joaquin phoenix is an excellent actor in the lead role
Nov 25 2023,negative,the script is so bad  the action scenes are pretty badly directed  the scenes in game of thrones were better than this movie
Nov 25 2023,neutral,this movie had great battle scenes that i enjoyed  very much however the portrayal of napoleon bonaparte was lack luster i really disliked all of the random accents from supposed french citizens i was slightly disappointed in the casting  as such an important historical figure i was expecting much much more of a cunning and calculated delivery and the writing was sub par also
Nov 25 2023,negative,dont waste your moneytime ridley scott   fails to link bonapartes failures on the battlefield with his failures in josphines boudoir phoenix is too old for the role he is older than bonaparte was at any time in public life josephine was 4 years older than napoleon but vanessa kirby is 15 years younger than phoenix the battle scenes are just a waste with no accuracy except that the french are on one siblde and nb entering the fray in a very nonhistorical way
Nov 25 2023,negative,a very disappointing movie by ridley scott itd be generous to say that its an incomplete portrait of napoleon and a grotesque depiction of such a complex historical figure the battle scenes are impressive however  but thats not enough to make it a good movie one comes out feeling that scott somehow wanted to portray napoleon as either a baby or a stupid monster his focus appears to be to humiliate the movies dialogs are non existent historical facts are not part of this film  could have spent 3 hours doing something more interesting
Nov 25 2023,negative,i did not expect one of the most powerful military commander and authoritarian to be depicted as a pining mopey teenager this movie neither came good on his great achievements which are still studied worldwide nor did it depict his controversial ambitions which are debated by historians strangely i cannot fault the performances but expected a much better art of story telling from the stellar team behind this almost three hour ordeal
Nov 25 2023,positive,beautiful movie  a tad bit long and too much unsexy sex
Nov 25 2023,positive,a thoughtful art film about the absurdity and history of war through the lens of napoleon bonaparte a theme that shows up in many of ridley scotts films making napoleon an impressive addition to ridley scotts library of film work  the only problem with the film is the way the film uses montage to move through time where one really needs to know napoleons history to not feel discombobulated with the huge jumps in time    furthermore veronica kirbys performance leaves one wanting more of her on screen as well as joaquin pheonix  only time will tell if apple robbed audiences of the better experience if or when the much talked about 4 hour and 10 minute cut of the movie shows up on apple tv    but as the barbie movie teaches us ideas are forever and the ideas ridley scott and his screenwriter explore in napoleon are important ideas for film critics to take notice of and not cop out their reviews of this movie with flowery words of discontent that to me seem to suggest the themes of napoleon have gone over some of their heads      in short ridley scott remains one of if not the best directors working today  napoleon is a must see
Nov 25 2023,negative,i was excited to see joaquin phoenix play this role and he had a few signature good moments  they were very few and very far between and not even his fantastic talent could save this typical modern hollywood mess  the movie was extremely slow and managed to make one of the most dynamic military figures in history look like he was emasculated and on quaaludes most of the time  its 2 hours and 38 minutes that felt much longer  by the time he got exiled the second time i felt like i had been exiled in the theater and longed for it to end  besides being slow it is sparse in historical context has very few battles scenes and no real incite into this military genius other than that he was nothing without the strength of josephine   so much for the man who revolutionized war in his time and influenced military tactics for a century after his death  maybe if josephine had went to waterloo instead of napoleon the french would have won its too bad we will never know lol
Nov 25 2023,negative,this movie would have to be five hours long to tell the story that is trying to be told everyone talks in accents except for joaquin phoenix
Nov 25 2023,negative,the movie is poor  although there was a lot of time and money spent on  beautiful pictures the content is empty the director spent 2h30 trying to sell the image that napoleon was an idiot     this is not another gladiator or master and commander
Nov 25 2023,positive,very breezy despite the length awesome battle scenes
Nov 25 2023,negative,the star is the wrong guy for this film hes sleepy throughout and for a guy that is supposed to play one of the greatest generals in historyhes just a hard sell    the second thing that misses the mark is the script  the director had a choice between being authentic or entertaining  unfortunately he chose authentic and missed the mark there too      it would have been a much better film if it had a more cinematic story       a good book on napoleon is napoleon a life by andrew roberts if you like the history     the movie is not recommended for entertainment or even if you are a history buff
Nov 25 2023,negative,i think the acting was done well you just need to have a whole lot of backstory  a deep understanding of napoleon prior to watching its extremely funny that the advertisements are 90 focused on the war scenes while the movie itself is 90 focused on napoleons love interest with josephine i came in with the basic knowledge of napoleon  his conquest  was very lost the movie does next to nothing in giving you detail about the events of that time if you have no knowledge at all about napoleon youre going to be alone on an island theres one battle scene that is actually incredible but the rest are underwhelming also theres legit like 510 characters in the movie that appear to play relatively significant role in the movie like his baby the mistress his former boss his russian wife etc these characters just vanish like a fart in the wind you have zero idea what happened to them he literally married the czar of russias sister  then in the next 5 minutes hes invading russia i dont know about you but that sounds like an interesting dynamic that i would of been curious to see play out for my best this movie will always be known as the absolute best oexample of it should have been a tv show over multiple seasons  not a movie unless you are more interested in napoleons personal life  his love interest you will be extremely disappointed youre just not going to watch this movie  take away from it that napoleon was one of the most iconic figures in history which is extremely sad  you could tell they tried hard but they didnt do a quality check before putting it out to the general public
Nov 25 2023,neutral,it felt kind of boring and drawn out seems like ridley has lost his touch
Nov 25 2023,positive,great acting by phoenix and kirby stunning battle scenes saw it in imax great job showing napoleons genius on the battlefield rooted in an intimate knowledge  or cannons and artillery
Nov 25 2023,negative,while the battle scenes were epic the historocity of napoleon was just incomplete for me the sex scenes were gratuitous no reason for them except to perhaps stimulate the audience ugly just ugly
Nov 25 2023,positive,decent battle scenes otherwise too superficial
Nov 25 2023,negative,very poor script with overinflated performances some epic battle scenes but there is little to salvage here
Nov 25 2023,positive,authenticity of scenes  depictions of the era  costumes
Nov 25 2023,positive,the story of napoleon and josephine
Nov 25 2023,positive,if you like battle scene after battle scene after battle scene with very little story line this is the flick for you while visually stunning the complete dearth of storytelling relegates napoleon to a completely forgettable 25 hours
Nov 25 2023,negative,this wasnt a movie this was like a animated wikipedia page the costumes were great but beyond that its hard to figure out wtf is going on
Nov 25 2023,negative,too many time jumps should have been a series
Nov 25 2023,negative,do not waste your money  i have no idea what i just watched
Nov 25 2023,positive,expected more from ridley scott movie was good but not great too much time spent on napoleon and josephines relationship compared to the lifespan of accomplishments and strengths of this historical figure a more structured timeline of events that led to his wars could have served us with a better perspective
Nov 25 2023,neutral,it was a missed opportunity a true shame with the names involved the scale was epic as a plus
Nov 25 2023,positive,great movie dont listen to nay sayers im glad i watched the movie 
Nov 25 2023,negative,storyline was totally boring wasted potential
Nov 25 2023,positive,costumes cinematography screenplay acting lighting set design all take you on a journey epic
Nov 25 2023,positive,flawed but  ridley scott is an incredible director  i felt the script was weak and that it was a mistake to take on too long a period of time napoleon had so many more dimensions joaquin phoenix  is an actor who could handle that complexity  so a missed opportunity
Nov 25 2023,positive,too much josephine for such great man story too long movie because of josephine  russian side is shown too shy no even faces except one imperator alexander no proper banners or flags really learn the history then   overall is good just could be better
Nov 25 2023,negative,this movie is absolute garbage a complete science fiction that is an insult to napoléon to france and history
Nov 25 2023,positive,you really need to know the history behind this one because it was mostly battle scenes
Nov 25 2023,neutral,disappointing the battle scenes were tremendous i get the feeling that with this new ambition of ridley scott we are facing another kingdomofheaven situation where the far superior version of the theatrical film in question simply isnt available yet
Nov 25 2023,positive,great cinematography and a very captivating story from beginning to end i enjoyed it
Nov 25 2023,positive,battle scenes were fantastic overall really great movie for those who enjoy history
Nov 25 2023,neutral,convoluted and boring despite the frequent battle scenes costumes were great and the battles were wellorchestrated but this film really fell short for me and i wanted it to end long before it did its too bad because im sure this was a huge budget film and i really wanted to like it
Nov 25 2023,negative,the movie was very boring  bad performance by joaquin phoenix as napoleon came off as a clown and not one of the most interesting historical figures of the last 300 years  vanessas talents were completely wasted in the film  i would not even watch this movie on a streaming service  i am sorry i paid full price for a ticket in the movie theater
Nov 25 2023,negative,long boring and full of historical mistakes
Nov 25 2023,negative,this movie was so fucking bad dont waste ur time
Nov 25 2023,negative,what a waste of an opportunity to tell a great story there was nothing here but a string of battle scenes that were not connected by any kind of historical or relevant story telling narrative such a disapointment
Nov 25 2023,negative,it was so disappointing to come to the theatre with such a great expectation and come out so disappointed tasteless plain vulgar
Nov 25 2023,positive,too long sometimes a bit difficult to understand due to the accents
Nov 25 2023,neutral,too much battlefield not enough character development
Nov 25 2023,negative,a disaster of a film  phoenix and his costar preform possibly and the set piece battle that are show impart a true sense of scale unfortunately thats all the praise i can provide  otherwise its garbage  poorly adapted for screen unbelievably poorly directed considering scotts previous works and so abridged from the historical record as to leave you wondering how nepoleon is even became a household name    it includes some inexcusably bad cgi comically bad and unfortunate sex scenes  bring some coffee if you really want to suffer through it or a pillow since a nap might be a better use of your time
Nov 25 2023,negative,battle scenes were good the story and the characters were lacking the movie was all over the place 
Nov 25 2023,positive,kind of a bad movie for historical standards things kind of just happen with no depth to anything no idea what story they were going for here
Nov 25 2023,negative,the cinematics were nice  thats about it the movie tried to cover too much borodino waterloo napoleons rise to power his fall etc its like trying to make a movie about a history of usa in 3 hours   an impossible task  so what we got was snippets of history sometimes years apart also the fact that joaquin phoenix looked bored or constipated in almost every scene didnt help    napoleon has a very similar feel to the patriot however the patriot has a coherent story events that tie well together and solid acting
Nov 25 2023,positive,an epic on the scale only ridley scott can deliver  joaquin phoenix so imbibes the role and his female lead does more with a half smile than most actresses with lines of dialogue  but the battles the horses special effects falls through the iceall brilliant
Nov 25 2023,negative,mehnot what i was expecting at all the whole thing was disjointed and it felt like huge portions were left out
Nov 25 2023,negative,this movie is the only movie that has made me angry enough to actually bother and make an account for the godforsaken website that is how bad it is for a movie that ends with a credit about the amount of death napoleon caused there is maybe 5 minutes of slightly cool action in the entire film and even whatever cool sequences come out of them are far overshadowed by the blatant disregard for anything resembling reality the casting for this movie although it has a big name lead is frankly appalling joachim phoenix is the opposite of every bit of napoleons character this is nothing against him he is great in other movies but his acting method makes it seem more comical than serious several times when grace and seriousness is required plus at the movies beginning when napoleon is about 2025 he looks about 50 and both main leads mr and mrs bonaparte get younger looking as the movie progresses and on the topic of time important details are just not in order and perhaps the biggest sin the movie commits is that the skip napoleons italian campaign not only his most important shaping moment but also the most important point in his and josephines marriage so even if you argue they avoid it to avoid making it a war movie their plot line depends on italy to set the foundation of why their marriage is so interesting italy is the honeymoon period of their marriage but also shows its rockiness and it also would have given an amazing opportunity to develop napoleon into a character that makes sense because it shows his good traits his charisma his persuasive personality and attitude his tenacity his ability for caring instead napoleon is only the narcissistic aggressive and seemingly bipolar clown he is in the movie now if you have that mixed with his other traits you have something compelling to leave the audience with which is the reason why napoleon is so fascinating which is because he is so complex so mysterious and so polarizing that we still cant come to a consensus as to what he is a warbound crazed maniac or a great not equivalent to good man whose leadership bound together generations of french society and brought together whole national identities but instead we are left with an empty husk of an arrogant narcissistic man who is no more lovable than this movie   010 no redeeming qualities
Nov 25 2023,positive,ridley scott delivered another historical visual spectacle that did reached its highs in its cinematography set designs battle sequences and captivating performances especially from phoenix and kirby as napoleon and josephine respectively however the film felt as if some extra scenes in between could have helped filled the void on maybe a more interesting exploration into napoleon as a character
Nov 25 2023,positive,ridley scott does grand historical drama
Nov 25 2023,positive,i loved it and joaquins performance was outstanding i will recommend it to family and friends i learned a lot and it kept my attention the entire time 
Nov 25 2023,negative,i usually love joaquin phoenix every movie i have seen him in has been spectacular except this one  his acting is flat and unemotional and i had a hard time watching him without wanting to fall asleep contrarily the actress who played josephine vanessa kirby was excellent
Nov 25 2023,positive,this is an exciting storytelling of napoleon bonaparte as he came into power the movie had a lot of interesting moments but could not decide which story it wanted to tell the story of napoleon bonaparte war hero or napoleon bonaparte lover  this movie is worthy of seeing on the big screen definitely worth the watch
Nov 25 2023,negative,the film is overall alright howevers they messed up a majority of the battles and simply did not have enough extras of the battle there are many examples of movies that have done this correctly a prime example being waterloo plus half of the movie is basically a ridley scott fanfiction
Nov 25 2023,neutral,it was ok great cinematography great effects acting was ok story wasnt good too much time to cover in a 2 hour movie details left out to understand the story and context was surprised there wasnt any french accents with the french people the battle scenes were good but i wish they had more depth
Nov 25 2023,positive,very good movie  the acting cinematography special effects definitely worth watching
Nov 25 2023,positive,thoughtful portrait focused more on battles ego private lives than napoleons deeds in administration land leaves our some important conservative and defensive postures by states out of france decided to prevent new order and democracy at all cost
Nov 25 2023,negative,two problems with this movie 1 this great story is all filmed in dark muted tones there are no brightly lit scenes sky or nature shots 2 mr phoenix and other actors whisper or mumble almost incoherently everyone around me kept asking what did he say subtitles would have helped
Nov 25 2023,negative,joaquin phoenix tries his best but this movie has no plot no point and fails at every step waste of money
Nov 25 2023,positive,a film that overall didnt capture the look of napoleon that many people were expecting and missed many of the his iconic moments this film also made the odd decision to focus more on his love life than his great battles
Nov 25 2023,negative,it was a tiresome relationship movie even though there were battle scenes sprinkled throughout might have been better as a cartoon at about half the length
Nov 25 2023,positive,review 
Nov 25 2023,negative,i thought i was going to see a great epic like braveheart or gladiator but instead i felt like i was watching a dark comedy at times the whole time it felt like the movie was to bash napoleon for being a stupid weird man
Nov 25 2023,positive,there was a lot of war violence in the movie  its enough to make me become a pacifist
Nov 25 2023,positive,very long very interesting history
Nov 25 2023,negative,the chronological timeline was great however to listen to dialogue from actors depicting french with a british accent was extremely confusing  while the general public may not catch this as an issue it would have been far more appealing to have some french accent by those acting as the french  thumbs down for me
Nov 25 2023,negative,this movie was utter garbage
Nov 25 2023,positive,ridley scotts napoleon was epic joaquin phoenix and vanessa kirby were great together amazing production design by arthur max and the costume design by david crossman janty yates was really beautiful and masterfully crafted i loved the music by martin phipps and the cinematography by dariusz   wolski was pretty amazing definitely best to experience napoleon on a large screen or imax
Nov 25 2023,positive,not the epic i thought it was going to be pretty good in spite of choppy  slow and not as informative as it could have been
Nov 25 2023,positive,pretty good  however too much about the napoleon  josephine love affair and not enough about everything else that was interesting or that made sense as to his rise acceptance etc  battle scenes were well done but in the end this film was about the wars and josephine  many missed opportunities
Nov 25 2023,negative,the plot is incoherent because it leaves out too many important historical facts the script has several ridiculous lines poor ms kirby phoenix plays a poor napoleon and as much as i adore r everett he is a poor choice to play the duke of wellington it makes one appreciate bonderchucks waterloo
Nov 25 2023,positive,this movie was on the edge of being great  the title should be napoleon and josephine as it spends a lot of time focusing on their relationship  lots of good history but more background on characters would be nice
Nov 25 2023,negative,soap opera with some battles thrown in not gripping disappointing
Nov 25 2023,negative,it was ok my wife fell asleep
Nov 25 2023,negative,it was slow getting started and the josephine angle didnt add up napoleon acting was really bad
Nov 25 2023,negative,the worst movie i have ever watched in years what kinds of sick people would make such a movie in the name of napoleon all is focusd on the flirtation between a man and hist wife besides that probably the only accurate parts are the date and the costume they should rename it the sexual life of napoleon and his fantasy military adventure  could not sit ther til the end waste of money and time if you want to learn napoleon and history do not go
Nov 25 2023,positive,not understanding the mixed reviews awesome satisfying and realistic battles compelling portrayal of napoleon if a bit more of a comedic tone than expected in phoenixs performance overall well worth the price to see on imax or in dolby
Nov 25 2023,negative,expected more action based movie not a bunch of scenes of basic plot and characters beginning was pretty good then its a waste of time
Nov 25 2023,positive,this was some really good insight and personal perspectives of the story of napoleon france europe and the wars and napoleons relationships  personality flaws the battle reenactments seemed realistic but sometimes long it was still worth a really good look into postrevolutionary france and europe as well as the aristocracy and personalities in play
Nov 25 2023,positive,too long too many battle scenes uneven relationship development  vanessa kirby is a dream sadly this epic does not work
Nov 25 2023,negative,worst movie ive seen in a long time if i wasnt with my family i would have left the theatre writing and dialog was awkward and bland scenes were chopped together with zero flow would have rather watched a documentary of him if it was supposed to be a love story it failed if it was supposed to be a war story it failed if it was supposed to show him in high regard as a brilliant war strategist it failed except the last credit listing his battles were you looked at how many people died zero story and character development its like they dont know how to make movies any longer its almost like we are accepting terrible just to be entertained are you not entertained no
Nov 25 2023,negative,one of if not the worst written history based movie ever made ridley scott turns the romantic relationship between napolean and joshepine into a flakey sex driven affair as swallow as scotts directing ability as a history teacher every battle was historiclly wrong or so badly trunkated to make them little better than smash and bang film moments based on shards of reality the lack of a back story makes you feel like you were dropped into the movie an hour in and the constant time jumps never gives the film a feeling of consistancy if you want the real story go watch napolean the pbs empires documentary series
Nov 25 2023,positive,while not ridley scotts finest historical epic napoleon nevertheless proves thoroughly engrossing thanks to refined performances from joaquin phoenix and vanessa kirby
Nov 25 2023,positive,this movie is more of a love story than what i truly was expecting to occur no wonder there is a 4hour version of the movie because there are transitions that you wonderwait there had to be more for the other part it is absolutely beautifully shot the cinematography is great phoenix and kirby give great performances    just wish we could have seen more of waterloo as that was his true downfall it went by too quickly    overall a solid 3755
Nov 25 2023,negative,depiction of napoleon at the beginning of the film failed to utilize phoenixs immense talent  he came off as a bilt of a dolt  it was difficult to tell who some of the characters were  the romance with josephine seemed disjointed especially afrter the annulment the battle scenes were the strongest parts of the film especially austerlitz
Nov 25 2023,negative,poorly done casting did not work and cinematography was poor overall not worth seeing
Nov 25 2023,positive,too long and lacking in plot and character development
Nov 25 2023,negative,the cinematography of the battles saved this film from a 05 rating
Nov 25 2023,negative,too long for this movie not well made huge let down
Nov 25 2023,positive,loved the staging of the battle scenes joachims performance was excellent
Nov 25 2023,negative,it was not napoleon it was josephine and napoleon with almost porn sex encounters not worth the money and time
Nov 25 2023,negative,utterly awful joaquin phoenix performance is a recreation of a giant sex obsessed mummy boy with no confidence man child not the greatest general who ever lived  the historical inaccuracies are through the roof and they do matter as they render the overall story of napoleon to being incredibly trite and dont do his military genius justice  i could forgive them if the actual underlying film was any good but it isnt  its boring  about the best thing to say is the costumes are excellent  havent been this disappointed since the star wars sequels  this could have been another historical masterpiece by ridley scott  its not
Nov 25 2023,negative,if they had spent as much on a screenplay as they spent on costumes and gore they might have had a decent movie  but a deadpan performance by joaquin phoenix and a detestable josephine a totally unnecessary amount of gruesome gore even to animals none of which advanced the story of napoleon contrived overblown and unrealistic battle scenes utterly gratuitous sex scenes that not long ago were unarguably pornographic bad supporting actors and childish if not insipid dialogue combine to make this movie a complete waste of your time and money
Nov 25 2023,negative,lag slow and minimal action
Nov 25 2023,negative,just a solemn and boring slog i was hoping to learn more about napoleon but at no point did i ever understand any of his motivation or if he was ever happy or sad or excited or depressed most of the actors tried to have some sort of character or personality but joaquin mostly sleptwalked through without any interest in much of anything
Nov 25 2023,neutral,the battle scenes are epic but the mumbling foppish napoleon and the dispassionate josephine left me wanting more
Nov 25 2023,negative,fought in 61 battles enjoy the 3 that you get to see title shouldve been josephine
Nov 25 2023,positive,great movie nothing but positive reviews
Nov 25 2023,positive,its great to see a historical film for adults a lot crammed in here but well done the two and a half hours flew by
Nov 25 2023,positive,the movie was excellent but felt abridged id like to see a directors cut
Nov 25 2023,positive,i guess i never learned much about napolean and josephine   what a complex relationship they had joachin phienix was terrific looking even smaller in stature than he is i love period pieces and this did not disappoint amazed at tge low rating scores
Nov 25 2023,positive,it was good  just a bit long
Nov 25 2023,positive,great historical drama  actors all superb
Nov 25 2023,negative,it was too focused on his relationship with josephine to the point of obsession i think napoleon was a lot smarter than the movie portrayed
Nov 25 2023,positive,it was a good plot but i felt that joaquin phoenix portrayal was flat i would have expected napoleon to be more bombastic
Nov 25 2023,positive,excellent napoleon was very well done and stuck the historic factd
Nov 25 2023,negative,the movie was generally enjoyable but the more you learn about napoleon the less we liked the movie seemed pretty far off base almost the opposite of oppenheimer poor execution
Nov 25 2023,positive,i got conquered by this movie
Nov 25 2023,positive,little long could have cut some of the battle scenes
Nov 25 2023,positive,great action and some history
Nov 25 2023,positive,excellent acting and cinematography  incredible battle scenes  i enjoyed the different layers of the film also
Nov 25 2023,neutral,long but also very rushed  major scenes and relationships dont develop the emotional weight to justify them  very pretty film
Nov 25 2023,positive,great epic story and costumes  napoleon had an interesting story line that kept me guessing what would come next  the movie held your attention and moved along well  the battle scenes were a bit graphic but it was very well executed
Nov 25 2023,negative,horrible and awkward dialogue weird music choices
Nov 25 2023,positive,the film concentrated long on josephine   napoleon was short in real life and historical  backgrounds were not very clear to us
Nov 25 2023,negative,worst movie weve ever seenwe left before it was overthe slapstick parts were so odd and it looked like joaquin phoenix was standing in a hole the whole time in order to make him appear short
Nov 25 2023,negative,parts of the movie are excellent  but overall it is too long and slow paced with very little color it looked black and white
Nov 25 2023,positive,great movie with a lot of history
Nov 25 2023,positive,the cinematography was of the highest caliber but the acting story and characters were wooden thin and under developed respectively  kirby seemed to at least try to infuse her josephine with personality but phoenix phoned this one in  he spent the bulk of his screen time frowning his face frozen in a thousand yard stare and that it was difficult to distinguish the protagonist from the antagonist is an indication of the muddled rudderless story cool battle scenes does not a epic biopic make
Nov 25 2023,positive,it is a good movie but it walks between the line of being a romantic or a war movie it does an awkward both not fully committing to either i still recommend it i can not wait for the 4 hour directors cut
Nov 25 2023,negative,boring  unlikable characters
Nov 25 2023,negative,disappointing disjointed and cheesy after gladiator i expected so much more
Nov 25 2023,positive,the music was perfect although the first piece did not go with the part of the movie it could have had a little less sexual content
Nov 25 2023,negative,awful movie  dull characters too much gore
Nov 25 2023,positive,too dark literally and figuratively murky scenes and with too much unintelligible dialogue disappointed
Nov 25 2023,positive,good acting and scenery
Nov 25 2023,neutral,phoenix napoleon his voice was very weakfelt like laughing right soldiers would give thier live for this guy notnapoleon was know for his temper tantrums none here how could he play napoleon at 23 and 47  this napoleon had no charismaa huge amount of history was swept asideno italian campaign no mention of nelson destroying his fleet in the nile or trafalgarit was more about him and josephinewhat napoleon was known was  for battles than being a loververy boring no epic  battles only a bit of waterloo  what about his brothers or marshals nothing
Nov 25 2023,negative,buy the popcorn and go home to watch anything else many hours of going nowhere read wikipedia and sleep through the movie
Nov 25 2023,positive,great cast and about the right length of time
Nov 25 2023,negative,abysmal super disappointed because id been looking forward to for months this was impossible to take seriously
Nov 25 2023,negative,we left it had no redeeming value spent most of the time fending off the assaultive feeling nothing cerebral about this movie just sensationalism without making a contribution learned nothing went home and looked it up on google to learn about napoleon
Nov 25 2023,positive,now i cant picture anyone else playing napoleon joaquin is fantastic its a tragic complex love story but we dont really get the full picture its tough to squeeze someones life down to a couple hours but they did a good job here the battle sequences are second to none awesome to see on the big screen
Nov 24 2023,positive,loved the authentic vulnerability from jp and that the fighting scenes did not go on and on like most war pics
Nov 24 2023,positive,while the scope of the history of napoleon is impossible to show in a movie i felt enough was included to give a n excellent portrait of napoleon great scene on the big screen
Nov 24 2023,neutral,not much of a storylineslow at times
Nov 24 2023,positive,good movie but it leaves out a lot things that happen in his life of course it would be impossible to include everything  would definitely recommend
Nov 24 2023,negative,as usual british directors tendency to ridicule french figureshistory is evident in ridley scotts napoleon contributing to the films shortcomings the historic inaccuracies and emphasis on a love relationship further dilute the potential for an authentic portrayal of napoleons life
Nov 24 2023,negative,this movie is the spit towards the french culture the way the characters are portrayed is offensive and pathetic im pretty impressed that there are so many people that are ok with this movie seems like the movie maker looked though the caricatures of 19th century and made a historical movie based on that
Nov 24 2023,positive,liked the cinematography  liked the supporting actors more than the main actor i love joaquin but didnt think he was the right actor to play napoleon
Nov 24 2023,positive,dont listen to the critics
Nov 24 2023,negative,very slowpaced   a lot of the movie revolved around josephine and napoleon  i could see no spark between them at all  it seems  joaquin phoenix decided to play napoleon as an emotionally shallow person wooden   unfortunately that woodenness seemed to metastasize to the rest of the cast   i can think of no character that i remotely cared about  i kept on telling myself to stick around and it would get better  it didnt
Nov 24 2023,negative,its a love story where was the history in the actual battles for which napoleon was famous for im a chick and i hated it
Nov 24 2023,neutral,this movie didnt disappoint in that i knew covering his entire life from the post revolution to his death was just too much to cover well and still satisfy with such an epic life done by a giant of a man ridley scott tried but just couldnt wrap up all the important details in the scope of a 230 hour movie this was a movie for history loversparticularly military history lovers and so much of his life regarding his prowess and weaknesses was omitted  it was like reading bits and pieces of our history books and left empty at the end what was interesting was the scenes following the revolution and how he came to power  the movie concentrated on his relationship with josephinealso a very important part of his life and part of what drove him to greatness it was just to spotty to me it left so much of how the man formulated his prebattle plans and why he executed them many important battles were completely omitted i think a few more would have been nice to see i think joaquin phoenix did a fairly decent job but seemed haggard towards the end i do concur with many critics in regards to the superb acting done by vanessa kirbyshe should be decorated with many acting awards for her contribution  i thought the battle scene at waterloo was semiwell done so much was left out of that fight but it was payed out out where viewers without and background study could appreciate the scope and key strategies the most i can give the movie is a three though any movie covering this much of napoleons life should be done in two parts it was more disappointing than noteworthy and i was so looking forward to seeing this
Nov 24 2023,positive,holds your interest and the film is very educational
Nov 24 2023,negative,plays like forrest gump but without the emotional investment
Nov 24 2023,positive,more focus on his romantic life than what he is famous for also the sound mixing could have been better especially with the way joaquin phoenix mumbles
Nov 24 2023,negative,one of the worst movies ive seen in a long time
Nov 24 2023,neutral,the battle scenes are gruesome and spectacular costumes and overall look gorgeous kirbys really good as josephine and everetts a hoot as wellington but phoenix is bafflingly uncharismatic and if this really is a satire its not very funny
Nov 24 2023,positive,very good film phoenix and kirby fantastic along with all of the cast much needed extended release will tie it altogether the same way scotts kingdom of heaven did
Nov 24 2023,positive,a magnificent film which skips through napoleons adult life and skips over some important elements of his impact on the world  law education liberty infrastructure industry science  napoleon is portrayed as a person more than as a great and visionary leader his relationship with josephine appears to be as significant a track as his national leadership  i was left wanting more especially of his attainments in cisalpine italy and of his disaster in leipzig maybe there is a directors cut coming  in summary this film brings napoleon into our consciousness and fascination
Nov 24 2023,neutral,a gigantic blockbuster in search of a compelling storyline bloated boisterous but ultimately rather boring  all spectacle but little in the way of context as much as i like joaquin phoenix he is dreadfully miscast in this one while not an absolutely terrible film i cant recommend it by the time you get to the battle of waterloo youve all but stopped caring
Nov 24 2023,positive,movie was a great and accurate depiction of both napoleons personal and public life showing what a brilliant combat statistician he was
Nov 24 2023,positive,should we expect the demise of such an egotistical ambitious and petulant personality to be portrayed any differently than it was in this film perhaps but i thought ridleys take was a worthy biopic with respect to cast and crew faithfully representative of the time and focus
Nov 24 2023,negative,not what i was expecting
Nov 24 2023,positive,joaquin phionex is a doomer icon always thought we needed a modern revamp of neoplean though they left out the part where nepolean got decked by guerillas in spain
Nov 24 2023,positive,loved the cinematography and acting phoenix is always solid could use an extra hour to fill in some story plot gaps
Nov 24 2023,positive,lucious production of napoleons time less battles after 2 one is topped and more info on his laws and governance he created which is still in force in france today love whatever ridley scott does
Nov 24 2023,positive,i liked it great story not an academy award winner but well done interesting movie
Nov 24 2023,negative,is it a love story or a biopic they cant decide and most of the history is glossed over or wrong 
Nov 24 2023,positive,apple splashed the money on this one with overlong and often gratuitous gorey battle scenes i didnt see anything comedic in it interesting story and no expense spared on sets costumes horses and cast  joaquin phoenix plays the eponymous role in neuro diverse style worth a watch they dont make them like this any more
Nov 24 2023,neutral,no character development no emotional investment in the characters no reason to care about them or understand their motives or what happens to them battle scenes were well done shouldve been a miniseries
Nov 24 2023,positive,napoleon its an absolute madness full of action overall a colossal success with ridley scott as the director a monumental movie every minute was indispensable and monumental the bigger the screen the better through its plot ive been deeply immersed in the film at all times adrenaline and the feeling of euphoria were present throughout the adrenaline and excitement ran through my veins nonstop hair standing on end everything in this movie is damn cool despite its historical errors i consider the film an unprecedented success the emotion connects you with the plot at all times ive even felt something beyond joaquin phoenix and vanessa kirby are the ideal actors for this film lucky they were there napoleons ambition and strategy are worthy of admiration under the prism of his addictive and volatile relationship with josephine a personal look at his origins his colossal successes his great battles and his fall how he became a general and later an emperor its impossible to describe in words what you feel watching this movie on the screensimply epic monumental scandalous napoleon will always be a legend a great reference a figure transcending our history impossible to forget 1010 his last words france army josephine
Nov 24 2023,positive,masterfully acted and great battle scenes maybe 15 minutes too long
Nov 24 2023,negative,it was ok  it was strange  everyone except napoleon had a british accent  there are so many qualified british actors that could have played napoleon
Nov 24 2023,negative,this is the worst napoleon movie i have ever seen bad acting bad script so so cinematography an absolute disaster dont bother going people made fun of the movie out loud during the screening
Nov 24 2023,negative,the costume department deserves every accolade they can be given for their fantastically periodaccurate work which was much better than this film deserved the movie tries to cover too much in too little time the relationship between napoleon and josephine ostensibly the focus of the film is underdeveloped and falls flat the portrayal of napoleon as an awkward socially incompetent weirdo totally undermines his position as a popular leader its bad to the point that it becomes unclear why napoleon seems to be so beloved in the few scenes with the public as all weve been shown is his social ineptitude and odd behaviour almost all of napoleons life is excluded from the film including most of his campaigns and victories and what we are shown is heavily fictionalized for time and drama napoleon is never shown in italy hardly shown in germany and his invasion of spain is never even mentioned to name a few to maintain its breakneck pace the movie jumps by years at a time in every scene and resorts to telling you what hes done rather than showing you while some of the scenes are well done toulon the coup the coronation waterloo the overall package scott presents is disjointed dishonest and totally disappointing
Nov 24 2023,negative,i was expecting much more  very lackluster and borderline boring
Nov 24 2023,negative,i made a rotten tomatoes account for the sole purpose to warn others not to waste your time or money on this abysmal movie the story telling is extremely incoherent i also struggled to tell what the tone of this movie is supposed to be one minute he is portrayed as a laughable awkward impotent man and then in the next scene he is a competent military general without any context whatsoever worst of all there was maybe 15 min at best of actual war scenes while the majority of the film is highly focused on extremely uncomfortable love making scenes that drag on for what feels like an eternity this is a complete deception of what the trailers suggested this movie was going to be about sadly this was the first movie in a long while i was actually excited to see and in theaters too and it was the first time i ever walked out on a movie
Nov 24 2023,neutral,its consistently just okay throughout the whole movie for an action movie the action sequences are okay for a character study joaquin phoenixs acting is just okay for a biopic its not all that indepth overall it did just enough to keep me engaged but just barely
Nov 24 2023,positive,long but moved along nicely interesting story learned a few things i did not know enjoyable
Nov 24 2023,negative,the movie fails to provide any context for its action set pieces or purposefully  misrepresents the actual history behind them  the movie is primarily focused on representing napoleons troubled relationship as freakish and perverted  i do not understand who this movie was for  it is a historical drama with no interest in history and a strange sense of drama    joaquin phoenix plays an awkward and impetuous loser impossible to picture as a popular general
Nov 24 2023,positive,too long the story was good  a little too violent
Nov 24 2023,negative,poorly shot and edited  made one of the most interesting characters in the history of the world and made him a boring stiff
Nov 24 2023,positive,the movie is really thrilling with a hooking intro and the performance from joaquin phoenix was thrilling my only misgiving with the movie is that there are some parts where you do need prior knowledge but all together i enjoyed this movie i really did
Nov 24 2023,positive,long corny love scenes good battle scenes
Nov 24 2023,positive,this is good history buffs  battle scenes were great
Nov 24 2023,positive,i thought critics gave too low a score  i cant recall any movie with such amazing epic battle scenes from that era  those scenes alone are worthy of a 90 score  phoenix seems destined for this role since i cant really imagine anyone else in the role  i supposed it cud had been more but i was not bored at any point of film and i was entertained  this is a quality film and not a quick hollywood cash grab by any means
Nov 24 2023,negative,all 15 stars are for the actors never wished i could unsee a movie goes in the pile with alexander and pearl habour  think napoleon annoyed ridley in a previous life
Nov 24 2023,positive,very well made however not very interesting
Nov 24 2023,positive,a good telling of a difficult historical story joaquin phoenix was a natural choice for napoleon due to his eccentric personality vanessa kirby however stole the screen with an outstanding performance
Nov 24 2023,positive,just a little long  just cannot hurry history
Nov 24 2023,positive,good movie if you know history
Nov 24 2023,negative,too much about josephine
Nov 24 2023,positive,this was a very interesting watch its told differently than i would expect but its very interesting to see napoleons story wouldnt say this movie is for me as i couldnt really connect with any characters but i have great respect for it but im glad i watched
Nov 24 2023,positive,excellent cinematic performance from phoenix he is the reincarnation of emperor napoleon
Nov 24 2023,positive,we loved it not dry and boring like some movies like this can be some unexpected lighter moments helped balance the seriousness of the rest of the movie the battles and action scenes were interesting and well put together excellent casting
Nov 24 2023,negative,short review boring incoherent goofy  long review what couldve been a welltold story is instead a choppy sequence of events with cheapcgi battle scenes im not sure if the intent was to make napoleon look bad or tell his story with an angle of him being the villain in any case around the halfway mark there was grumbling from the audience so i know it wasnt just me wait for it to come out on streaming and save your money
Nov 24 2023,positive,this movie was amazing
Nov 24 2023,negative,one of the most boring movies i have seen in a long time there is almost a complete absence of coherence story and meaningful dialogue  the costumes were great tho
Nov 24 2023,negative,although tray tables were stowed and seats were in the upright position tonights feature film never got off the ground
Nov 24 2023,negative,not much of a story line besides his love for his wife
Nov 24 2023,positive,i love ridley scott movies and did appreciate and enjoy this one battle scenes are epic and the acting phenomenal  scott is a real visionary and his films are always works of art on so many levels this movie has gorgeous cinematography as expected and the best actors i loved the injection of humor here and there the movie is a bit too long in my opinion  and moved slowly in parts which is reflected in my stars given
Nov 24 2023,positive,i really liked the trailer and im going to watch the movie
Nov 24 2023,neutral,i dont know if it was the comfortable chairs or the slow moving movie but i had a really hard time staying awake
Nov 24 2023,positive,the movie was phenomenal and superb 
Nov 24 2023,negative,a disrespect to history and a broken reflection of it   sad to see such a prominent figure be degraded to this extent
Nov 24 2023,negative,it was endless war scenes with a minimum of information about napoleon his painful relationship with josephine was treated as almost sitcom sincerity the film has competent actors and photography scott should have done better
Nov 24 2023,positive,great period piece attention to detail is fantastic two and a half hours seems long but theres a lot to pack in from 1793 to 1821 joaquin phoenix is incredible again i suppose that because so many details had to be cropped or condensed this probably begs for the production of a limited series
Nov 24 2023,positive,the immersiveness of the setting can take the viewer back in time to the napoleonic era the pace is rapid  no doubt but it covers the entire 1789  1815 era some of the background to napoleons rise is potent on screen while three of the top battles are covered here  out of the dozens of possible choices scott had to key in on just a few and toulon was a great way to start
Nov 24 2023,positive,as a historical piece its inacurrate and irritating at times as a movie i throughly enjoyed
Nov 24 2023,negative,slow love story not a war movie as advertised save your money go see hunger games twice
Nov 24 2023,negative,approximately 15 minutes of battle over nearly 3 hours of film  long and boring often uncomfortable  too much josephine and even once dead she still speaks
Nov 24 2023,positive,j phoenix is quite good playing the part of napoleon bonaparte the french conquerer of european regions joaquin embodies a historical figure our modern society did not have an opportunity to observe unlike the actions of other leaders which rose to power in our time such as the other monster the world chased in world war  2 whatever sources this acclaimed actor several times over used to seemingly raise bonaparte from the dead to portray on film was effective and mesmerizing it is worth going to see the movie napoleon on reai imax screen the mannerisms right down to the facial expressions jp enacts is downright fun and even hilarious at some points i believe it was ridleys direction to purposefully add levity to a dark past when men superiorly sufferred on the battlefield as the medics today would indeed possess on the spot pharmacological and technical approaches to battlefield wounds back then men suffered thoroughly but perhaps i did also as i found the run time a bit long succumbing to the subconscious tired i may have been feeling while the light of the moving image affected my ability to stay alert i fell asleep on the film at least twice but only for moments i wanted to see more of joaquins masterful work while the battle sequences were grand and one in particular that results in the enemy drowning in a frigid pond it was as visually stunning as many viewers absorbed the game of thrones series which starred an equally gifted ensemble cast if you like cannonballs youre in for a treat the movie completes ineffectively for the portrayal of a conquerer only to observe napoleon slump to end credits without audience applause of course he dies as every great leader dies eventually we all do some of us poisoned theres violence bloodshed adult themes with little nudity political unrest a small scene reminiscent of january 6th comedy mostly drama and battle scenes that are amazing to watch seemingly at a larger scale than seen on got the movie nearly slows to a bore at moments but i would see it again if being at the movies is no longer an affordable option then itll possibly first arrive to appletv strreaming services if that is the case one can wait for it and if you havent watched the got fantasy series now is the time while you wait for napoleon to present himself in pause mode as you ready the microwave popcorn enjoy have a decent holiday in this crazed world we all live in
Nov 24 2023,positive,napoleon is a captivating historical drama that delves into the life of one of historys most iconic figures napoleon bonaparte director ridley scott masterfully paints a portrait of napoleons rise to power from his humble origins to his eventual crowning as emperor of france the films narrative is interwoven with napoleons complex and passionate relationship with his wife josephine adding a layer of emotional depth to the story    joaquin phoenix delivers a tourdeforce performance as napoleon capturing the brilliance ambition and ruthlessness that characterized the french leader phoenixs portrayal is both captivating and nuanced revealing the man behind the myth vanessa kirby shines as josephine portraying her with strength grace and vulnerability their onscreen chemistry is palpable making their love story the heart and soul of the film    scotts direction is masterful bringing napoleons world to life with sweeping visuals and epic battle sequences the films cinematography is stunning capturing the grandeur of napoleons conquests and the intimate moments of his personal life the score is equally impressive underscoring the films dramatic intensity and emotional resonance    napoleon is a mustsee for anyone interested in history war or the complexities of human relationships it is a film that will stay with you long after the credits roll
Nov 24 2023,negative,what a mess it truly was
Nov 24 2023,positive,really good movie im not quite sure making it a story about fame was the right path though
Nov 24 2023,negative,long boring and incoherent  absolute waste of my time
Nov 24 2023,neutral,most definitely a datemovie the cannon ball into the horses chest ensured this napoleon was not an engaging character in this film there was no emotional connection between him and the audience or with any other character in the film except for josephine josephine was the rich and developed character she was engaging and the force in this film     sadly ridley scott is no david lean despite his best effort
Nov 24 2023,positive,i thought it was well filmed and very pretty to look at except i thought the actingmcoukd have been better
Nov 24 2023,positive,great cinematography stunning battle scenes great acting
Nov 24 2023,negative,its like someone made a biopic of tom brady and showed his first nfl game one super bowl and his last loss in the wildcard while filling in the gaps with comedic stuff about his relationship with giselle
Nov 24 2023,negative,although the film has some spectacular battle scenes it spends too much time focusing on napoleons love live and not enough on his rise to power and diplomatic accomplishments the movie could have been about a fictional character rather than napoleon and worked out much better since they got wrong most of the historical facts about his life
Nov 24 2023,positive,some disappointment   expected more from ridley scott and this line up of actors
Nov 24 2023,negative,this movie could have been great but even joaquin couldnt save it the dialogue plot and acting was all underwhelming the story focused far too much on napoleons odd love story instead of going deep into his fascinating battles and accomplishments 
Nov 24 2023,negative,this was a movie about the worlds greatest military general and it only had maybe 5 minutes of anything involving war but it was to show the personal relationship with josephine there was zero character development or chemistry between the two  pointless and terribly derivative love story
Nov 24 2023,positive,the movie is enthralling cinema the likes of which has been absent from theater for years one becomes captivated by the story of napoleon from the opening of the film the sets costumes and acting create a mesmerizing 25 hours i will see it again at the imax
Nov 24 2023,negative,when the first trailer came out i am excited about actor and director i set the bar too high for this movie the first thing that came to my mind was the character of napoleon who was an emperor of the french who did great things like in his stories   but that is not the part that i was disappointed it was the editing that made it difficult for the audience to fully immerse themselves in the narrative although joaquin performance was done well in the movie that was not enough to make the movie more interesting
Nov 24 2023,neutral,nice history lesson but boring characters
Nov 24 2023,negative,the film was like a 10th rate d action movie my wife and i walked out after about 30 minutes  later we read a scathing review if we had read the review prior to attending we would have cancelled the tickets
Nov 24 2023,positive,the actors were marvelous i loved the cinematography and costumes it was a visual treat for the eyes the music was beautiful i dont usually like battle scenes but they were interesting and incredibly well done went home and spent hours reading about napoleon
Nov 24 2023,positive,good move get to know napoleons wow well done
Nov 24 2023,negative,long shallow movie  no energy no excitement no real tension for a movie devoted to a goat of military strategy  boring and pathetic flop
Nov 24 2023,positive,no movie could truly do napoleon justice but i think they got it with the 25 hours the movie was joaquin phoenix did a wonderful job portraying him battle scenes were truly iconic
Nov 24 2023,negative,one of the most dishonest historical movie i have ever seen in my life scott is so dishonest that he did not even take the time to change napoleon face between his 20 years old  and his 56 scott is  making fun of himself in this desastrous  movie joaquin phoenix is not even actinghe should receive the strawberry for  worst actor  on this
Nov 24 2023,negative,i give this movie a c its not phoenixs best performance speaking in an obvious american accent made the character feel out of place the writing was positively dull the humorous moments were funny but felt like a pander to modern audiences i dont think ridley scott honestly cared about this film the direction felt lazy careless and incoherent it pales in comparison to his masterpiece gladiator the costuming and battle sequences were spectacular boiled down this felt like a really long made for television movie with a slightly larger budget
Nov 24 2023,positive,had a little bit everything except a lot of swear words
Nov 24 2023,negative,what a disaster by far my greatest movie dissapointment this year although i had a hunch that napoleon and ridley was not a very promising match to begin with
Nov 24 2023,negative,a ponderous and boring movie badly cast save your money and time
Nov 24 2023,negative,it was a hodge podge history lesson that lacked any level of cohesion the timelines jumped decades without any rhyme or reason confusion of main characters chrildren spouses this movie is a hot mess
Nov 24 2023,negative,a family member raves about the movie so i had to see it jp is a great actor but the movie came up way short of my expectations i think the rt synopsis is pretty accurate at least it wasnt a remake overall disappointed
Nov 24 2023,negative,i ve had such high hopes for this movie  i love ridley scott and joaquin phoenix instead of the great war epic i was expecting  all i got was a caricature of napoleon with a boring plot  i give it 1 extra star because the cinematography is excellent and thats it  pity such a great pity 
Nov 24 2023,positive,movie very dark even in happy moments creating very gloomy movie
Nov 24 2023,negative,hollywood and the lefts attempt to relegate  one of the  greatest leaders in history into a mumbly sexually incompetent cantankerous war monger achieves exactly what it set out to dojust a disgusting piece of garbage
Nov 24 2023,negative,first five minutes is cool  the next hour is about his awkward relationship with his wife  i had never walked out of a movie until this one
Nov 24 2023,neutral,seemed to drag and there were was a lack of development of certain characters
Nov 24 2023,positive,great history and action
Nov 24 2023,positive,vive la postrevolution  an amazing gritty immersive movie experience that has it all magnificent battle scenes true love humour great acting mr phoenix and v kirby are just incredible and high adventure   a must see for pure visceral entertainment and a nice uplift of the soul  stands second only to blade runner as my favourite ridley scott movie
Nov 24 2023,negative,what a disappointment battlejosephinebattlejosephinebattleend   phoenix who i long admired seemed as bored as we were   every character a cliche   so superficial
Nov 24 2023,positive,honestly one of the best movies ive ever seen truly amazing
Nov 24 2023,negative,went to watch the movie napoleon last night with my wife and was really looking forward to it as were both big ridley scott fans     the cinema a london vue only contained 4 people including us to say that i was very disappointed with the movie is an understatement     we both found it to be poor in all areas in part due to the extreme darkness in all scenes that made it a hard watch there were huge jumps in time that in my opinion failed to properly link up the timeline    the only decent parts were the battles but again  they were so dark it was very hard to properly engage     this latest effort from ridley scott is in my opinion a huge failure
Nov 24 2023,negative,it was a very bad movie napoleon seemed so stupid in this movie we got to see very little fighting picture quality was very poor story was too longwinded napoleon himself almost never fought in the film a big 0 for this bad movie
Nov 24 2023,positive,a bit long but oh so good
Nov 24 2023,negative,longest three hours ever great opportunity for an important story to be told that was wasted 
Nov 24 2023,positive,the movie was good i thought it would delve into the mind of the man instead it just showed he was a bit quirky i was so looking forward to seeing joaquin phoenix play this out
Nov 24 2023,neutral,it should probably have been called my dear josephine the film is based on the achievements he made outside the wars not what you expect from ridley scott who made classics such as alien gladiator blade runner you can clearly see and feel that romantic drama is not his strong side  a bit strange to hear the french speaking english and the english speaking american   if nothing else joaquin phoenix was good and lived into the ambitious emperor that napoleon was but again it was about his private life with war as a side track maybe more from the englishamerican point of view
Nov 24 2023,negative,its not only the boring part its the assumption we shall be interested in a dull performance in a nonexistent script ppl leaving early
Nov 24 2023,positive,very entertaining regarding the portrayal of france war history
Nov 24 2023,negative,its probably the worst napoleon movie ive ever seen the film doesnt seem to bother to study the history at all i would say the moviemaker has never even played napoleon total war at all to gain a very basic idea of what napoleonic wars be like  napoleons army charged from a trench like ww1 troopers cuirassiers heavy cavalry fought in the woods and cavalry and infantry charged together from the front the duke of wellington shouting fannies napoleon returned from egypt only because his wife had affairs napoleon led cavalry charge at british life guard at waterloo etc   sitting in the theatre i felt the same as pope pius vii when he was on napoleons coronation only thinking we desire to leave  and ive heard that the british media gave a high score to the movie id say should that be true the movie is totally a disaster
Nov 24 2023,negative,when you compare this film to gladiator it is a damp squib of a film the cinematography made every shot feel dull gritty and bleak maybe they were going for that it just didnt give you that visual impact    they concentrated on the relationship between napolean and josephine the actress played her very cold and unemotional which made it unengaging to the viewer josephines domination over him in the film made the character of napolean a lesser person so you didnt really feel that he was this great commander of armies joaquin phoenix is an actor who plays his characters as understated again making napolean feel small rather than powerful    i really didnt engage with the film and left feeling a bit disappointed    somehow what should have been an epic film was made dull its not a total flop but it isnt an epic film that i would want to watch again
Nov 24 2023,negative,judging by the trailer this movie was up to so much more than it actually delivered first of all it shouldve been a two movie project for a few reasons napoleons actual rise to be the greatest conquerer is barely shown we just see battle after battle then he randomly crowns himself and dies eventually  where is the detail in the art of war how did he end up in the position he so desperately wanted to be in how did he get to be the emperor he dreamed of that woulve been the topic of a first movie the movie i saw couldve been the successor to that despite giving us a really intimate view into his personal life his character and his struggles  depicted like ive never seen a movie do before  it just fails to tell a coherent story why would i need to see him fuck like a rabbit three times why do i need to see him and josephine stare at eachother for half a minute in complete silence i want more of those breathtaking war shots i want to see how he plans his fights his politic advancementsand where the fuck was the battle of the nations in leipzig
Nov 24 2023,positive,enjoyed the movie allot movie flowed  very easily and i never got bored the movie i feel made napoleon likable even though 3 million soldiers died in battle under his command  i dont know if that was scotts intentions i thought the acting was good
Nov 24 2023,negative,i walked out after 3o min and saw hunger games instead which was great this is a really poor movie from a great director
Nov 24 2023,positive,seemed as though filmmakers couldnt decide whether to focus on napoleans domestic situation or his military exploits both suffer as a result
Nov 24 2023,positive,movie is exactly what i thought i would be a heart pounder for two and a half hours highly recommend seeing it in dbox while you can the cannons will knock you out of your seat in all truth if youre a napoleon fan this movie will not disappoint go see it
Nov 24 2023,positive,i found this movie quite disappointing to much focus on the relationship between napoleon and josephine relegating historical aspects to a secondary role
Nov 24 2023,positive,what could have been one of the best films of the year feels like a microcosm of ridley scotts career due to disjointed visions towards the source material    the screenplay feels malnutritioned as if a 4 hour epic has been forcefully cut short to 2h40mins entire acts are not fleshed out scenes end abruptly and the editing is jarring and unpleasant to look at    although its surprising valleys napoleon has its fair share of peaks  much like the great emperor himself if you may a stellar performance by the entire cast applause worthy set and costume designs cinematography that makes it look like a mediaeval royal painting has come to life  a treat to experience in a theatre    features rivetting and jawdropping war sequences with some of the best crowd directing i have seen in recent years theres a lot of cgi here that you will never notice  the best type of cgi the final act is definitely the strongest the first 2 needed more time to breathe
Nov 24 2023,positive,good not great  a little long but worthwhile  wished for more warbattle scenes although the ones here are cool especially the first raid     that poor horse
Nov 24 2023,positive,great historical epic offered a ton of psychological perspectives behind the man that ruled the world watch it on the big screen
Nov 24 2023,positive,this movie was just soso for me the battle scenes were good but too short and did a poor job of showing napoleons tactical genius the overall movie tried to bite off more than it could chew and really should have been a 2 movie project instead as one movie it felt like ridley scott had to really work to cram everything into it and aspects of the plot seemed thin what seemed too long were all the josephine scenes there was too much time devoted to that aspect of napoleons life phoenix was okay as napoleon but he didnt have much charisma perhaps napoleon himself is not the most charismatic person but he just seemed very stiff and stilted overall a decent effort of a movie but lacking in some areas and overdone in others
Nov 24 2023,positive,it tries to cover too much and feels disconnected and vague the acting is not taken advantage of because it feels like ideas are left incomplete its as if the director is not sure what story hes trying to tell
Nov 24 2023,negative,the battles are really well filmed everything else is hogwash even the battles themselves are not close to what transpired
Nov 24 2023,positive,this movies strength lies in its focus on the characters imputed psychologies and direction flows from that focus its not a documentary and the french may not like the quirky portrayal of their emperor once those parameters are established one can happily become absorbed by the acting and not demand too much of the plot
Nov 24 2023,positive,there was far too much to cover about this complex individual in one movie the battle scenes were very well done but too few of them to show napoleons true battlefield genius his relationship and love with josephine seemed pretty well done but his rise to power as first consul and emperor were virtually ignored as were the periods of european domination from 1806 until the russian campaign in 1812 im a former ap european history teacher so for me it might have been a bit of a letdown but for the average viewer it was probably enough to get an overview of his life and call for further study if desired
Nov 24 2023,positive,really good just long 
Nov 24 2023,positive,that movie was amazing dont understand why the 1 star reviews the battle scenes were exceptional both vanessa kirby and joaquin phoenix crushed it the acting was extremely good
Nov 24 2023,neutral,disappointing but interesting and an epic watch
Nov 24 2023,negative,i was expecting something amazing like gladiator or kingdom of heaven nothing of the sort   almost completely filmed in england   bad cgi   absurd dialogue  recycled music from bbc war  peace used   odd scenes of napoleon and a mummy napoleon slapping josephine during the reading of the divorce among so many other awkward scenes   shockingly disappointing of note two people walked out and one fell asleep was snoring
Nov 24 2023,positive,this was a good movie not great but i came out of the theater enjoying what i had just watched surprisingly funny too
Nov 24 2023,positive,i like the show but a lot of killing and sooo much killing cant believe people had to die like that its insanity
Nov 24 2023,positive,film focused too much on napoleons relationship with josephine and not on his achievements as head of state at all  napoleon was way more than a lover and a warfare genius  he actually did a lot to develop infrastructures and modernize france
Nov 24 2023,positive,awesome movie really cool battle scenes and a little too much on the love story side or whatever that was 
Nov 24 2023,positive,we have another really good movie with joaquin phoenix i feel it could have been epic and amazing however it feels pressed and that causes some confusion maybe a directors cut will make that happen i can not wait to find out
Nov 24 2023,negative,bad writing and directing  story jumped around and over anything that would explain his rise to power  best part was laughing at man snoring in audience if i was at home i wouldnt have seen the end
Nov 24 2023,positive,the direction and editing was top notch storyline was all over the place and it wouldve been better to make it either  love story or a story about napolean as a general as much as i love phoenix i was super disappointed in his performance he was the only character in the film with an american accent why
Nov 24 2023,negative,if i had never heard of napoleon bonaparte or france i would still not recommend this movie it spends more time on unnecessary and terrible sex scenes and awkward dinners than explaining why most of the battles were even happening if youre a big history buff and wanted to see a certain campaign you find interesting depicted too bad egypt literally one volley fired then he just talks about josephine austerlitz 5 minutes of really cool battle then you hear more letters to josephine borodino slow mo charge into a line of infantry letter to josephine waterloo actually cool to watch probably because josephine was dead every opportunity hes going to go and talk about how bad he misses josephine then go home and yell at her then have vaguely creepy sex with her it depicts napoleon as a childish megalomaniac that others just lifted to power do yourself a favor and spend the same amount of time watching the waterloo movie
Nov 24 2023,positive,the accents werent very good  the story wasnt really accurate
Nov 24 2023,negative,warbattle scenes entirely too long superficial content left me with little understanding of events in context of history  could have been a good movie napoleons character somewhat humorous though certainly arrogant
Nov 24 2023,negative,if i could rate this movie a zero i would no character development no depth no storyline you could follow no attention to detail outside costumes or set piece all you walked away with was a knowledge that joesphine got boned four times and the movie was all about her woven into madness absolutely no historical accuracy and napoleon was portrayed as a horny teenager ridley scott should be ashamed of himself 17891821 in 2h 38mins why couldnt a cannonball come through the screen and hit me and put me out of my misery save your 1000 ticket fee for a movie that at least earns it and doesnt put you to sleep
Nov 24 2023,positive,i really enjoyed this film alot of people say its overstuffed and all over the place but i think thats a product of trying to fit several decades into one movie
Nov 24 2023,negative,this movie was an awful movie disjointed boring a real snoozer  joaquin phoenixs talents were wasted in this role and i was super disappointed that ridley scott was associated with this mess dont waste your time or money
Nov 24 2023,negative,boring dont waste your money
Nov 24 2023,negative,one of the greatest stories told through a poor screenplay and direction
Nov 24 2023,positive,it was boring i wished to see more iconic napoleon moments and the vanessa kirby character completely ruined the movie for me
Nov 24 2023,negative,this movie made me hate history
Nov 24 2023,positive,everyone who gave it a 1 star or said  save your money doesnt even know what a good movie is this movie is pretty good everyone should go watch it
Nov 24 2023,neutral,the battle scenes were some of the best in any movie but the portrayal of his personal life made napoleon look like a whiny cuck joaquin phoenix was stale and just played himself dressed as napoleon the writing was corny at times in a weird attempt to be comedic and overall they left out a lot of background on who napoleon was yet alone how he rose to power if they made this into a 10 part mini series with more detail and focus on napoleons character it would have been great
Nov 24 2023,positive,there were a few historical blips but visually great  a bit overdone on the sex scenes
Nov 24 2023,positive,excellent scenery costume intense heart felt love from napolean for josephine his army and devotion for peace i need to study him again
Nov 24 2023,neutral,it was slow i didnt know if it was a love story or a history of a general in war j phoenix just wasnt napoleon in my opinion and the movie was just slow in spots  the music was very interesting very beautiful  i was very excited to see the movie but was unfortunately disappointed
Nov 24 2023,positive,good historical drama about the life of napoleon well done movie if you arent a history fan then you may not enjoy this movie
Nov 24 2023,negative,if you know nothing about napoleon or the history and could not care to know then this movie is for you  the movie skipped over a ton of major points in his career especially his battles and really misrepresented him as a character  dragged a lot and was very hard to keep focused very disappointing
Nov 24 2023,negative,dialogue was terrible  graphic sex scenes unnecessary joaquin phoenix is better than this  the battle scenes and coronation were eye catching also why was this filmed in england
Nov 24 2023,positive,if you know nothing about napoleons history you can see it
Nov 24 2023,negative,stinker way too much josephine way to little following napoleons career sex scenes were not sexy way too long
Nov 24 2023,negative,absolutely horrible movie i dont know what joaquin phoenix agree to do this ridiculous movie total waste of my time and money
Nov 24 2023,positive,absolutely flawless joaquin phoenix delivers a not often seen side of napoleon in this brilliant performance
Nov 24 2023,positive,not the movie i expected from the trailers advertising it if youre somewhat of a history buff then overall youll enjoy this movie however it really should have been called napoleon and josephine  as its really more about that relationship than all the battle scenes albeit good that they dangle to you in the trailers  good movie but got a little tiresome watching napoleon screw and screw over josephine
Nov 24 2023,positive,such a good trailor and great movie
Nov 24 2023,negative,it was horrible    left early
Nov 24 2023,negative,it skipped way too much felt like one of those history chanel documentaries that has a professor talk for half of it and live action the other half
Nov 24 2023,positive,the dialogue was difficult to hear in many instances  cant these people articulate their lines so that the audience doesnt have to guess what they are mumbling  also the dogstyle sex was gratuitous  i thought there was so much of it that josephine would start chasing cars
Nov 24 2023,positive,it was beautifully shot and subtlety hilarious great work by the entire team
Nov 24 2023,negative,a humiliating adaptation of arguably one of the most iconic figures in european history the gritty and historic epic that was advertised is an afterthought to cheap jester like depictions of a helpless blithering napoleon disjointed story telling leaves the viewer with more questions than answers its not all bad the acting and the design are beautiful  but thats not why were here
Nov 24 2023,positive,if you come to this film expecting a history lesson prepare to be disappointed at its essence this a relationship story about napoleon and josephine unfortunately that part of the story doesnt provide much satisfaction theirs is mostly a transactional relationship she wants to be an emperors wife he wants a son    but the battle scenesoh my the battle scenes there are three in all and they are as spectacular as you will find anywhere and because they are grounded in reality they are much more compelling than the cgi battles that plasticize movies these days ridley scott is a master at this and it shows    and then we come to cherry on top is there any other actor working today who can command the screen like joaquin phoenix his acting power is what prevents this film from being ultimately forgettable his and ridleys talent together are what almost raises napoleon to the level of epic
Nov 24 2023,positive,true story line great character representation
Nov 24 2023,positive,somewhat different than scotts other titles but it always good to change it up to stay fresh
Nov 24 2023,negative,i was duly warned not to go see this film  i am glad i didnt it is poorly done
Nov 24 2023,negative,wow one of the most boring films ever made
Nov 24 2023,positive,the military scenes were well done would have preferred to see more of this than contemplative scenes with voice overs of their love letters
Nov 24 2023,positive,my 11yr old said  its the best movie i have ever seen
Nov 24 2023,negative,errrrrrrm actually i realised at 14352 that napoleons hair line was 1 fragmentation of a millisecond to short and this deeply upset me and it disrespected and discriminated my religion of raelism and if you think you are right then i am sorry but not sorry to burst your personal bubble but you are erm actually deeply undeniably incorrect also i am bigger then you so that automatically makes me qualify for the correct status what upset me even more was the fact that at 5227 napoleon moved forward 2 steps which is actually incorrect because us smart people would realise that napoleon wouldnt step forward for another 314159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510 seconds i know this because i am right and you are wrong and there is nothing your unbelievably tiny miniscule brain can do about it i would love to point out the other 537 very noticable mistakes in this movie but i would prefer no to waste my brain power on a site full of poopy people like this so this is  au revoir erm also if you didnt know what au revoir means it is actually good bye in french cold
Nov 24 2023,positive,this movie could have been a perfect documentary with vivid epic battle scenes and relationship with josephine was beautifully portrayed napoleons character however was too cerebral and cut short in my opinion which was a little disappointing knowing how exceptionally talented joaquin is i wanted to see more of a napoleons personality and 2 hours was simply not enough time for joaquins character to develop and show the full depth and inner conflict perhaps tv series would have been more successful
Nov 24 2023,negative,well that was disappointing  josephine by ridley scott isnt sur wait oh no sorry napoleon by ridley scott isnt sure of what kind of moviebiography it wants to be does it want to be about napoleons well known politic and war legacy while giving his battles not even a third of the movie does it want to be a take on his more personal side trying to figure out what kind of man was able to shake europe up while not trying to put into the story any justification on his motivations and actions does it want to be a terrible love story between him and josephine while not giving the viewer any reason to care about josephine and bonaparte for that matter i dont know  the movie starts strong giving you a taste of everything you get a hold of how napoleon acts really quickly thanks to phoenix you get a good battle scene you get an introduction as to who was josephine but it feels like it never goes anywhere  im willing to bet that josephine is on screen more than half the movies length so what does she bring to the table i dont really know and i dont really care the film goes out of its way to make the viewer hate her more and more as time passes and youre never really sure how does she feel about napoleon is she manipulating him does she like to humiliate him does she love him the movie seems to change that perspective on her every time was that meant to be a evolution of the character if it was it was not well done or shown that weird love story definitely drags and is by far the worst part of the movie while being the most prevalent  napoleons characterization is so weird youre never really sure about what to think of him everyone in the movie apart from josephine either admires or is afraid of him and the story never really shows why he goes from winning a short battle in the beginning of the movie to being emperor without accomplishing any other feat of significance and in most of his interactions he seems to be weird and pathetic so does the movie want you to hate him not sure in specific moments it seems like they try to make you admire or at least pityempathize with him the main problem with him is that we dont really know why he is doing this and why everything is happening the only traits we can get from this is that he is a little bit on the weird side and that for some reason he really loves josephine is he a really patriotic man that wants to bring france in to its highest glories it says that numerous times but it also shows that a lot of his actions are guided by greed and hunger for power so its that his motivation not really because it never goes anywhere significant with that is it mommy issues it makes you think about it but not really  one thing this movie does really well are the battle scenes they are really dynamic show you a lot of interesting stuff about how wars were fought in that area and does a good job at showing how wellversed in warfare strategies an tactics napoleon really is whats the problem they are never really the focus it seems like they   are just there to justify something that will happen later on all of those somethings being really uninteresting  while reading this you notice how much questions i wrote but that how you really feel when you leave this movie it doesnt feel like a story with beginning middle and end to it it feels more like a acted documentary that doesnt know what to document  i would not recommend you to watch this movie specially if youre interested in the historical figure that names the movie or his era in fact i would not recommend it to anyone
Nov 24 2023,negative,didnt make it past 1 hour
Nov 24 2023,positive,entertaining true to the events
Nov 24 2023,positive,while the story couldve been handled a lot better napoleon still captures the battle sequences set pieces time period and overall tone very well
Nov 24 2023,positive,the movie had a good story several good facts but i didnt like the fact it focused quite a bit on josefine in the end i can see why she was there so much sex scenes and all but i which it was more history detailed
Nov 24 2023,neutral,so many important things could have been covered instead it was semiboring and silly
Nov 24 2023,negative,joaquin phoenix and ridley scott are two of my absolute favorites in the film industry  so i was very excited to see this on opening day  disappointing  boring i just wanted it to be over  the connection between napoleon and josephine also was not there for me
Nov 24 2023,positive,the movie was ok but i did not like joaquin in that role quite disappointing
Nov 24 2023,neutral,it was mediocre long and drawn out  decent but expected more
Nov 24 2023,positive,this would have been much better presented as a mini series
Nov 24 2023,positive,i thought it was a very well done film it kept my attention throughout though it was a very long movie well acted and solid sound editing job worth watching for sure
Nov 24 2023,negative,legit the worst historical film ive ever seen napoleon is portrayed as weak and a cuckold when you know history you know this is absolutely not true sex scenes i dont know what to make of scott telling historians to fuck off wasnt it billed as a biopic that stuck exactly to historical facts  a producer who doesnt like france and its history then why are you making the film  a lead actor who hates napoleon so why play him  in short a bland film that has nothing to do with reality
Nov 24 2023,neutral,josephine is very well conceived while that of napoleon lacks the tragedy and cruelty as well as the aspiration to conquer in addition napoleon had mistresses galore declared himself as emperor at age of 30 but never ages in this movie backstabbing and behind the scene plotting is poorly done instead there is ample noncontributing scenes of visiting different castles
Nov 24 2023,negative,i loved the old waterloo movie and i love napoleon in history and i was so exited for this movie that i brought my dad and several cousins to this clown show the movie is horrible and a joke after an extremely promising start with the battle at toulon it turns into napoleon being a sub and simp for josephine showing mostly their relationship quite literally making it worse than twilight their divorce lasts longer that austerlitz and borodino combined they wasted way too much time on his private life which is mostly fictional and there was no real room for fun battles something that napoleon is best known for there is 3 battles plus borodino which is 1 short reminiscing scene and none are satisfying to watch after wasting so much time on his love life i at least hoped for an action packed payoff towards the end of the movie but nope also not a single one of his marshals is properly introduced or atleast namedropped properly overall meh at best and not even worth as a casual watch especially if youre a history fan
Nov 24 2023,positive,it truly was an epic  however the movie details dates of birth of napoleon  josephines different than the internet  great detail about the life of napoleon and moved along quick enough for personal enjoyment
Nov 24 2023,positive,war is rather ugly and the battles depicted war at its true nature  the film was welldone but it displayed the french as somewhat unruly arrogant and vulgar  humanity not at its best  tired of it
Nov 24 2023,positive,the winks  nods to modernity shockingly hit all the right notesbut an incomplete narrative has me looking forward to a second viewing once the complete total film is released on apple tv
Nov 24 2023,positive,this movie was more a love story with little explanation of the events taking place in the movie the acting was amazing but the writing was very underwhelming felt like i kept checking my watch waiting for it to be over
Nov 24 2023,negative,a shallow ahistorical hit piece on napoléon thinly stretched across a series of fantasy depictions of napoleonic warfare     one of the planets greatest stories butchered what have you done ridley scott
Nov 23 2023,positive,easy to understand the time period
Nov 23 2023,negative,currently watching the movie as i write this this movie is terrible one of the worst movies ive seen this year
Nov 23 2023,positive,there was too much information brought in from his entire life and career in being a commander and chief and exile three hours was long enough plus the advertisements for regal
Nov 23 2023,positive,just saw the movie and i thought it was fabulous im am shocked it doesnt have a better score the sheer magnitude of the scenes deserves 5 stars  how dare people condemn this movie you try making this film and delivering the level of realism it deserves he led a life of battles and destruction so to be true to the story you have to show all the brutality along with the loving moments less face it if they didnt show all the battle scenes people would still complain and rate it poorly cant please everyone sad
Nov 23 2023,negative,its hard to know where this sits in ridley scotts litany of stinkers but its certainly up there with the counsellor and robin hood and those awful alien prequels
Nov 23 2023,positive,not even brilliant battle scenes could save this overthetop and yet still dull 3 hour pity party
Nov 23 2023,negative,napoleon is considered one of the greatest if not the greatest general of all time however the movie portrays him as a pathetic clown who stumbles upon success  many of the actors portraying french speaking citizens speak in an british accent which reduce the frenchness of the story that it need   the cinematography was great considering the budget   this is not an ode to napoleon or france
Nov 23 2023,negative,the movie is like bad mayo all the good ingredients are there the story the cast budget director but still it doesnt mix well and you end up with parted mayonaise
Nov 23 2023,positive,battle scenes 1010 but everything else was 610 reason being there were some really funny parts that caught me off guard
Nov 23 2023,neutral,this film gave me cancer
Nov 23 2023,negative,weak script acting and basic story line  we wondered if possibly our level of expectation was too high in going to the movie but ultimately concluded that after leaving the theater the fact that there never was anything in the movie to engage the interests of the people in the audience  the only positive was that the special effects were impressive
Nov 23 2023,negative,using the word epic as a descriptor for this movie is a massive oversell if this is an accurate portrayal the man was small in about every way tough to see his ability to command  let alone become king just bland from start to finish 
Nov 23 2023,positive,i havent seen absolutely everything hes done but this has got to be joaquin phoenixs best work and vanessa kirby is ridiculously hot so easy to watch  and they both gave outstanding performances this film made me wish wed learned more about napoleon in history class definitely will watch again
Nov 23 2023,positive,a solid overview of his rise to power and military skills excellent battle scenes  lacked detail of his early life  unnecessary sexual scenes and conjecture  but still worth watching
Nov 23 2023,negative,i liked the womens clothes and the horse and joaquin
Nov 23 2023,negative,very beautiful cinematography   ridley scott completely misses the character the greatest commander in history with alexander and caesar is reduced to being an insecure and hectic lover and general scotts napoleon would not be able to run a small towns fire brigade as he is one xanax pill away from an emotional breakdown
Nov 23 2023,positive,great movie to watch with friends amazing filming and dialogue worth the length of the movie
Nov 23 2023,positive,if youre a casual movie goer the movie is a 89 outa 10 if you are huge into history and enjoy the era the movie portrays its a major disappointment even with all the beautiful cinematography and atmosphere theres too many historical inaccuracies for me personally to fully immerse myself in the story id give it 35 outa 5
Nov 23 2023,negative,terrible depiction of a great historical figure they make him seem like a screaming toddler no historical accuracy
Nov 23 2023,positive,outstanding film in all respects
Nov 23 2023,positive,this movie was fantastic  im sure not everybody will like it as much as me because it didnt have robots and aliens and bad acting so im sure im an outlier
Nov 23 2023,negative,as an englishman i should revel in the fact that the french have been done so dirty however on this occasion i have to back them this movie is terrible i have been looking forward to this film for months being a history neek and coming with the territory well versed in napoleons amazing life and story when we think of napoleon we think of a tactical genius on par with caesar commanding armies in the hundred reds of thousands with new methods that stunned his enemies napoleon lost because his marshals were targeted instead of him the allies too sacred to attack his forces even though they outnumbered him because of this genuis and his well known ability command im not going to mention the woeful historical and chronological inaccuracies as others more educated will do that the most shocking thing is not how boring it it slough it seems like a 3 hr special of downton abby but the pathetic character that hes portrayed to be in this film he doesnt not not once even command a room not once seem to command anyones respect and not once inspire it was so bad dont waste your time even if you know nothing of the man or the history youll still find it boring
Nov 23 2023,negative,walked out  rambling incoherent and disjunctive  no discernable storyline  im just glad noti know saw me paying to see it  phoenix looked like he had never acted before  i was embarrased to be there  it sucks
Nov 23 2023,negative,boring confusing and long avoid or wait and watch it on the tv
Nov 23 2023,negative,it was as some took the napoleon wiki page added 5 extra helpings of a weird love story and turned it into a movie forget to add connective tissue
Nov 23 2023,positive,an utterly joyous historical romp redolent of the buckled swashes of yore if youre looking for historical accuracy then youve missed the point  big tongue in big cheek stuff with the steamy love of the bicorned superstar and his bawdy muse bursting bodices and bodies in equal measure across the embattled fields of historiography  kirby steals this from phoenix  like josephine stole napoleons heart the supporting cast is pure british character gold loved it loved it bravo mr scott  take a bow as you stick up two fingers
Nov 23 2023,positive,great film amazing score and action and visuals good story and solid acting solid subtle humor definitely go see
Nov 23 2023,positive,amazing  the biggest surprise was the intimate telling of a panoramic story  thoughtful clever and even funny
Nov 23 2023,positive,i really enjoyed this movie the battle scenes were amazing you dont get to see this type of epic movie hardy ever anymore joaquin phoenix is napoleon 
Nov 23 2023,negative,movie review time no plot spoilers    if you want to see this film save the money and buy it on dvd not even bluray when it hits the walmart discount bin worth an 8 watch if you want to see a completely disjointed gappy pseudohistory storyline of the man with halfway decent battle scenes at the end when he loses but some special effects like the ships burning at harbour were lame now that ive mentioned it you notice them for sure    every scene change skips over months or years with no explanation you wont develop any feelings or connection whatsoever towards any of the characters or be able to name most of them by the end of the movie youll know napoleon and josephine and thats about it    was expecting much more from ridley scott but he seems to be slipping so many lost opportunities here we join his timeline half through his military career and end when he drops dead on st helena with no explanation as to how either happened and time in between these two events is laid out in much the same fashion    it doesnt work as an historical reinterpretation  it doesnt work as a love story with josephine  it doesnt work as a drama or a comedy    on a scale of zero to two thumbs up ill give it a solid meh  and wont be picking it up on dvd
Nov 23 2023,positive,absolutely unexpectedly executed amazing
Nov 23 2023,positive,stunning visuals good pacing and stellar acting youll enjoy it
Nov 23 2023,negative,no care taken to accurately characterise the man his actions or his achievements there have been some powerful and epic takes on his story in the past this is not one of them a good film for 10 year olds after an action film every film he makes it becomes more and more confusing that this is the man who made legendary films until 20 years ago
Nov 23 2023,negative,horrible depiction of napoleon battle scenes were poor and  mediocre failed to show the strategic genius of napoleon
Nov 23 2023,positive,great movie wish they would have went into more detail of his accomplishments and failures instead of what the director thought of his feelings this man brought europe to its knees and they made him look inept
Nov 23 2023,negative,ive expected much more from this but phoenix is brilliant as always
Nov 23 2023,negative,the most boring movie in a dacade ridley scott will waste you time dont torture yourself
Nov 23 2023,positive,well it wasnt great disappointing to say the least should have been called napoleon and josephine since a third of the movie is devoted to their relationship also ive read many reviews about this movie and no one has mentioned this glaring issue napoleon is the only one in the movie without an accent  i mean come on man you know he must have known about this role for at least a year he didnt bother to get an accent coach please brother give a little more effort
Nov 23 2023,negative,this movie is not worth the watch trailer made you believe it was going to be a historical biopic it made a completely mockery of napoleon and joaquin phoenix   is stuck in playing the joker
Nov 23 2023,positive,a masterpiece great actors and director  extraordinary performances
Nov 23 2023,positive,loved the movie vanessa kirby and joaquin phoenix were amazing in their roles
Nov 23 2023,positive,it was equally the history of his battles and his love story with josephine was about 20 minutes too long but otherwise pretty darn good
Nov 23 2023,positive,not a joaquin phoenix fan but went regardless great cinematography action  of course the story of napoleon is incredible however it didnt find any of the characters well developed nor the dialogue engaging and its damn long almost 3 hours coupled with characters you couldnt give two sheeits about 3 stars
Nov 23 2023,positive,really there needs to be a build up or an introduction of who napolean is and what he had done on his rise to power you dont see it and you have to take the movies assurance as it hadnt shown much of his rise battle scenes aside the movie seemed a bit all over the place brushed over his rise and his fall and left a lot of filler inbetween
Nov 23 2023,positive,very impressive i did not know that fitting napoleons career in an entire movie was possible but it apparently is best joaquin phoenix performance since the master and i think the relationship he had with oscar nominee vanessa kirby is the best part of the film it could have been that for 2 and a half hours as i expected josephine to manipulate napoleon but in truth they had a loving relationship with eachother which i thought was beautiful   amazing battle scenes so close to perfection    grade a
Nov 23 2023,neutral,i was astonished a few times during the film yesterday eg the expedition to egypt come on are you serious they hit the top of the pyramids with such a destroying power as shown from that distance why are the flags of the modern turkish state shown more than a hundred years earlier napoleon returning to josephine from egypt alone is a lie as is their first time they met  wrong time and wrong place there was no party of the survivors furthermore napoleons date of birth is given wrongly during their wedding ceremony  napoleon did not fight at waterloo himself nor did he observe the battle from a tent
Nov 23 2023,negative,not all of it was a historical nonsense  1 ive read 4 biographies of napoleon and studied him for 3 years huge amount of facts movie got wrong example how moscow looked like friendship of paul barras with napoleon that early in his carrier the battle on the ice scene real they bombarded ice when opposite army was already in retreat and so on   2 what they got right napoleon was not the emperor of france he was emperor of the french there was indeed an african high ranking officer ancestor of dumas in his court and so on   3 phoenix played hamlet and not napoleon we know a lot about napoleon huge amount of biographies of people who knew him and his autobiographies too he spoke with an accent was extremely unconfident early and extremely confidant later in his life and so on  4 dialogues were horrific napoleon is known for a lot of quotes which we still use today he did not talk like a high school linebacker especially to josephine  5 what was going on with music   6 no character was developed at all no motivation was shown for actions of any character josephine was a rich housewife who lost everything during revolution and to survive in jail became a slut and slept with a lot of people high ranking but she did it to survive and to save her child from guillotine napoleon was a child of sicilian aristocrats who were reduced to almost nothing and was laughed at by his french classmates and fought them a lot  7 napoleon has one of the most fascinating biographies in histories which reads better than three musketeers for example he was rejected by a 16 year old girl but did not forget her and later made her a queen of sweden and all swedish royalty is still coming from that girl  overall if you look at it as a typical satisfyall american movie its ok if you look for historical accuracy and artistic value you might want to look somewhere else
Nov 23 2023,negative,without any doubt this is the worst movie of scott  this movie only serves one goal to denigrate napoleon at all cost  the mocking is so used and repeated that it becomes boringawkward and made me check my watches 3 times  scott didnt even bother to do some basic researches on the matter which he clearly admitted during his latest interview i mean yes its not a documentary but when youre making a movie about history the least you should do is to know your subject thats probably why he got hurt by the critics scott just gathered all the cliches made up by the opposition at this time and condensed them in a 2h long movie even if it means to delibaretely lie on napoleon action  i was hoping the battle scenes would be as good as in gladiator but dont count on it even there the blatant inconsistency made me question if scott still has all his head
Nov 23 2023,negative,this movie was a stage 3 i want my money back my time back and my mind erased   it was too disjointed they highlighted all the negative aspects of napoleon with none of his more interesting positive characteristics the movie spans nearly his entire life and displays none of his character growth all the characters felt two dimensional it was way too focused on his relationship with josephine and made it seem like she was his primary driver to leave egypt and exile on elba if youre interested in napoleon at all or know anything about him this is a skip
Nov 23 2023,positive,i actually thought it was a great movie but some drama seemed unnecessary it was awesome to see the promotion of traditional relationships
Nov 23 2023,negative,i think id sum it up as  short guy takes shirtless bathroom selfie for hot british mannequin he sees on tinder mannequin acts like sex doll with a bunch of randos but short guys like whatever the hot chick is mine short guymannequin are deeply passionate which is shown by how fast they have sex     oh and some other historical stuff happens
Nov 23 2023,positive,great movie but couldve been better
Nov 23 2023,negative,its hard to believe ridley scoot could make a boring movie but he really managed to do it this time the story of napoleon unraveled like a pbs documentary plodding from even to event the battle scenes were cool but the dialogues were tepid ridley didnt seem to have an opinion about napoleon
Nov 23 2023,positive,new personality im literally napoleon
Nov 23 2023,neutral,they concentrated way too much on his relationship with his wife theres so much more interesting things they couldve concentrated on
Nov 23 2023,positive,i think film critics in 2023 are just some losers begging to be heard this movie was phenomenal and really portrays how much of a giant pos napoleon really was cheers to joaquin phoenix and everyone involved in this wonderful film go watch it its 100 worth it
Nov 23 2023,neutral,well acted and cinematography was great as with all scotts films but it was long along with that the battle scenes lacked any thrills  they really skipped through most of them it felt even waterloo was a let down in my opinion  even the russia invasion it really didnt show his determination to press it was very soft more visual  a lukewarm film that was forgettable a movie to watch during the day at a discount not full price
Nov 23 2023,positive,very good movie and alot of action and explanation about whats happening or going on if you cant stand blood then this movie isnt for you
Nov 23 2023,negative,this is what you get when a director who knows nothing of history directs a quote on quote historical epic if youre a fan of history steer clear of this ive never seen a historical figure get so trounced on and reduced to such a wimpy jealous whiny little person 80 of this is nothing but a josephinenapoleon awkward soap opera huge time jumps that make no sense at all one second theyre having a mid marriage meltdown next youre jumping to three years later to napoleons coronation as emperor with absolutely no explanation as to how or why we got there no italian campaign no spanish campaign 5 minutes of egypt and 15 seconds of borodino the battles were extremely underwhelming and seemed like something out of sharp just go watch waterloo and save yourself the time with these battles speaking of waterloo that battle was absolutely botched la haye saint and hougomount literally arent even depicted on the battlefield considering how vital they were to the outcome of the battle its a shame i cant count how many times i was sitting there each time i watched napoleon charge on his horse cringing the guy wouldve never done that you would not walk away from this movie thinking that this guy was one of the most influential and most genius military commanders in human history hey but you get a 20 second snippet of all the battles napoleon fought outlining the casualties at the credits the movie had no clear story line to follow you were constantly in and out of different moments with little to no explanation shoot 65 of napoleons life and accomplishments are missing its honestly a shame i already came into the is movie with low expectations considering who the director is and his track record with history but this didnt even surpass those     again if youre a fan of history dont watch this dont waste your precious time and money
Nov 23 2023,positive,it is interesting to see yet feels like a streaming type of film the battle scenes are interesting to see in dolby theatre yet despite being quite a few of them a lot of the film moves at a slightly different pace its not a bad pace yet this isnt a gladiator type of film a bit requires historical knowledge of events as they are displayed on screen with brevity if at all overall ok film
Nov 23 2023,positive,it is better than the marvels  its worth it if you can watch it in imax format ridley knows how to make use of a wide canvas especially in the battle sequences
Nov 23 2023,positive,great movie im usually not a fan of war movies but i quite enjoyed this one
Nov 23 2023,positive,there were moments of tedium as the movie seems to take us from battle to battle 
Nov 23 2023,neutral,broad and imposing displays of warfare with excellent cinematography effortlessly draw the viewer in who is only to be left dissatisfied by the lack of depth this movie holds favouring the surface over a deeper exploration into the madness of its titular character causes this historical tale to be hardly anything more than a plotless arrangement of visually pleasing scenes
Nov 23 2023,negative,napoleon is a bust the battlefield scenes are striking but most of the film is dedicated to his toxic relationship with empress joséphine napoleon himself is portrayed comedically inept and accidentally falls into power his cult of personality is referenced but never shown
Nov 23 2023,positive,great acting great sets very good coverage of an amazing life
Nov 23 2023,positive,after laughing hardy at this democrat we look at what he achieved    napoleons legacy  napoleon however left durable institutions on which modern france was built up including the napoleonic code the judicial system the central bank and the countrys financial organization military academies and a centralized university napoleon changed the history of both france and the world    give him awe
Nov 23 2023,negative,extremely slow and boring poor screenplay with no flow to the story
Nov 23 2023,negative,the movie is too long and seems disconnected flowwise in certain parts joaquin phoenix is an amazing acting talent and does a great job in this movie but his acting alone is not enough my wife left and walked around the mall as it was too gory for her
Nov 23 2023,negative,rushed through battles made napoleon seem petty horny and childish historical inaccuracies abound he never shelled the pyramids spent way too much time trying to make us sympathize with josephine but even that was all over the place very erratic everything is through a grey filter meh 
Nov 23 2023,negative,it told a story but didnt really make you feel anything
Nov 23 2023,positive,one of the best movies of the year  the battle scenes is take your breath away  ridley scott is back with one of the best epics of his career  those idiots only know how to criticize how they would do a better movie   im looking forward to seeing the 4 hour and 10 min directors cut
Nov 23 2023,positive,napoleon was beautiful the story and action was epic and some of the best acting directing and design i have ever ever seen
Nov 23 2023,negative,theres a term for movies like this  its just on the tip of my tongue  what is that  think think think  oh yeah it sucks    this movie is an unfortunate combination of one of the greatest stories in history fantastic actors no direction and a script with all the finesse of a toddler doing a drum solo on old pots and pans in the middle of the kitchen floor  its one of those movies that you keep hoping that its going to improve  spoiler alert it doesnt    and we all know war is hell  you do not need to show a horse getting its chest split open by a cannon ball  and we really didnt need to see the graphic sex either    very very disappointing
Nov 23 2023,positive,it was gory in parts a bit peculiar overall im just not sure about it
Nov 23 2023,negative,my husbands response summed it well i just watched a 25 hour movie about napoleon and i still dont know anything about napoleon i wanted to go home an hour into the movie but he insisted we stay since we had already invested that much to be fair the second half was a little better than the first i tried to find the story in the film but it was more like watching an animated timeline yeah there was some josephine and other characters but nothing and no one developed except the war scenes
Nov 23 2023,neutral,from the commercials for this movie it looked better than it was  it was slow in parts and somewhat disjointed but i like the two main actors if you still want to watch it i recommend waiting until you can stream it for free
Nov 23 2023,positive,muito top 
Nov 23 2023,positive,awesome plot great special effects and overall story
Nov 23 2023,negative,i wanted so much to like this movie ive been looking forward to it since i saw a trailer back in july i loved gladiator and after joaquin phoenixs performance as commodus theres no way this movie could be anything but great with ridley scott directing wrong aside from a couple of great battle scenes the movie felt thrown together there was no cohesive timeline and many of the great things that defined napoleons tenure are missing from the movie completely the relationship with josephine felt off and it was just awkward to watch it really seemed like a waste of talent on a soso telling of napoleon
Nov 23 2023,negative,should have just been titled josephine napoleon was depicted as a baboon who should have never been in power and instead of depicting why the world knows his name just centers around his relationship with his first wife viewers who know nothing about napoleon will leave still knowing nothing about napoleon lastly it was marketed as a actionwar film to be similar to gladiator and is really a dramacomedy that just drags for long periods of time
Nov 23 2023,positive,it was perfect just perfect down to the most minor details
Nov 23 2023,positive,some well shot battle scenes and a color grade that looks like a historical painting however i wanted more out of napoleons character and i struggled a bit with the long runtime an average at best joaquin phoenix performance  only because i hold him to a high standard
Nov 23 2023,positive,amazing movie keeps you wanting more
Nov 23 2023,negative,what was the point of making this movie  joaquims newyork accented napoleon spends 2 and a half hours blubbering and sniffling into his handkerchief  he gets no respect from the french directory from the royal courts of europe from josephine from wellington now theres a character that ridley scott seems excited about  and even the remains of an egyptian pharaoh spurns napoleons attention    no sense of what napoleons career meant  no awareness of the mans grandeur  no acknowledgement of his talents as statesman and lawmaker  even his military achievements are somehow made plodding and dull  scott was given such an opportunity with this project and couldnt have dropped the ball harder had he wanted to  this isnt a movie  its a character assassination  to render napoleon into such a banal and limpid little man iswellvery british  scott had an opportunity to take the french down a peg and he really ran with it  but did he make a good movie  well i liked gladiator but this one is more aligned with some of his other more appallingly awful movies  prometheus 1492 gi jane robin hood exodus gods and kings alien covenantwho keeps hiring this guy
Nov 23 2023,neutral,historical phoenix is a good actor the movie was entirely too long i guess some directors ridley scott will never learn that less is more
Nov 23 2023,positive,the movie had great battle scenes and the complexity of the relationship between napolean and josephine the 2hrs 40 min went quickly as the movie flowed
Nov 23 2023,neutral,boring no tension or general interest in the outcome of any character
Nov 23 2023,neutral,an enjoyable watch biut failed to depict the true greatness of napoleon in war and the skill he possessed in order to dominate europe if anything it made him look weak incompetent childish and fictional
Nov 23 2023,positive,one of the best war films in several years this movie has some of the best battle scenes from the era i have seen in cinema joaquin does a great job and should be nominated for an award for this movie best movie of the year a must see on the big screen
Nov 23 2023,positive,im very excited for this movie
Nov 23 2023,positive,very dark lighting voices low too long amazing facts  he was great
Nov 23 2023,positive,nice movie and worth to watch
Nov 23 2023,negative,the good of this movie is joaquin phoenix being an absolutely stellar actor and theres no denying that the film is not just beautiful to look at but does a good job of showcasing the time period  however the script is terrible the story does not flow well at all and its almost as if the movie is made for people who already know napoleon is my date fell asleep at least 6 times and i almost did too its boring and not worth the watch
Nov 23 2023,negative,i was really looking forward to this film which i saw in winchester last night the seats were really comfortable and the staff very accommodating i cant think of anything more positive to say about it
Nov 23 2023,positive,superb  forget the bellyaching from the history lovers and appreciate phoenix epic performance  sure its divisive and subjective but art should be shouldnt it  this was never a documentary so calm down and enjoy  technically excellent the sound mix especially beautiful detail missing from a lot of films lately  could have been a tighter edit but lets remember its a huge story and still so much couldnt be covered in the time frame  cant please everyone   will def watch the longer cut when it comes out
Nov 23 2023,positive,i wwas looking forward to seeing napoleon but when i watched it i was looking forward to it ending so much work went into this epic production but its a bit of a mess it might have worked better on a streaming service in  episodic format but that would only solve the repetitive nature of the battle scenes    how many canon muzzle flashes can you squeeze in  casting was wrong or badly directed poor joaquin didnt seem to know the character and ms kirby just felt like a beverly hills beauty at a fancy dress party  ridley scott is a great film maker but you cant win em all  it never felt grounded
Nov 23 2023,positive,an incredible film no one does historical dramas better than ridley scott joaquin phoenix is superb and vanessa kirby is phenomenal
Nov 23 2023,negative,absolutely boring couldnt have sat there and watched it for almost 3 hours walked out part way through
Nov 23 2023,negative,ahistoric character assassination
Nov 23 2023,positive,i admire the story i wish there could of been longer battles or things to make it look epic especially the royalist insurrection battle of pyramids and borodino literally last 30 seconds max this movie jumps scene to scene quick  i also wish they would of covered the campaign in italy as it was one of the most significant parts of napoleons life unfortunately a bit too much drama of josephine and napoleon and not napoleons campaigns but at the end of the day theres only so much you can fit into one movie
Nov 23 2023,negative,i like napoleon but this movie is so boring theres a lot of good things they can show but they focus too much on his relationship with josephine and even portraying him as a sex manic didnt felt a military genius napoleon but a cocky napoleon so i left the theater after an hour 
Nov 23 2023,negative,i like napoleon but this movie is so boring theres a lot of good things they can show but they focus too much on his relationship with josephine and even portraying him as a sex manic didnt felt a military genius napoleon but a cocky napoleon so i left the theater after an hour
Nov 23 2023,positive,well i doubt a film has divided opinion so much for a very long time  perhaps the only thing we might be able to agree on is that the costumes and sets were sumptuous so that it is really easy to feel immersed in the period beyond that i suspect it depends on your particular interests and knowledge  for me the central love story was beautifully done and the acting by the two leads was amazing  i think ridley scott has done a terrific job of trying to portray napoleon the man warts and all  sadly for me it is the battles that let the film down  visually engaging and bloodily gory in a way that only ridley scott can do yet betrayed by its departure from period tactics and frankly history  and the less said about rupert everetts sneering caricature of wellington the better  my advice  watch it up to the retreat from russia make a cuppa and then watch the 1970 waterloo
Nov 23 2023,positive,the cinematography is a work of pure art  apple studios always holds up when in comes to the quality of motion picture joaquin phoenix plays the part of napoleon very well some qualities that i noticed is that he is a dramatic romantic as you would expect a frenchman to be he had the ego of an emperor which came with a short temperament but what i really liked most about his role is how human he was you could see the fear and angst he held while about to charge into battle when he was being chased by the mob and he stumbled down the stairs when he was leaving to meet josephine and he forgot his hat it is not your average action film with precise choreography but instead reveals the fallibility in humanity our clumsiness our capability to both love and start war that mankind is both passionate and mundane it is a cinematic art piece
Nov 23 2023,negative,i really really wanted to like it but no  instead im just terribly disappointed  i love joaquin phoenix body of work and ridley scott is almost always incredible and i thought their reunion would be worthy of the very very long run time  i was wrong  i give 2 stars for the scenery photography costumes and set design  the script is boring   and i just didnt care about any of the characters or what was going to happen  i actually walked out near what i imagine was the end
Nov 23 2023,positive,ridley scott didnt disappoint fascinating story well told
Nov 23 2023,positive,the movie was absolutely fantastic cinematic combination of romantic relationships and war and carnage the movies ability to paint napoleon as a hero villian and comic all at once is simply spectacular
Nov 23 2023,negative,someone interwove a terrible romantic comedy with a brilliant war film  youll laugh at the movie but not because its trying to be funny
Nov 23 2023,neutral,napoleon its quite amazing not the spectacle not the film  but the way a 2½ hour movie feels crushed and hurried into its screen time a lots packed into the 28 years of the eponymous heros life here from bloody revolution to exile in the south atlantic but its done in such a frenetic breathless way that not only do we never have time to properly get to understand our gallant soldier we barely glimpse those around him they are the third violins or the percussion as the orchestra leader struts from paris to toulon to tilsit to waterloo vanessa kirby as josephine is allowed some screen time to display her idiosyncrasies and beauty to her suitor but that apart its battle army and war you sense that sir ridley scott knows his audience may be struggling helpful names are burnt onto screen to direct the audience oh so thats tsar alexander i oh now were in austerlitz oh theres the leader of austria and on the subject of austria its plain annoying to see a comedian  miles jupp  hamming it up as emperor francis i  why cast him there    the set pieces of the battlefields the coronation the location of the first empires palaces and country homes are undeniably clever spectacular and beautiful in equal measure and at the same time scott shows us the ghastliness of war for this he must be praised the waterloo reenactment is a tourdeforce but but but  the man at the centre of it all remains as unknowable as the sphinx he gazes upon in egpyt ridley scott has done wonderful work joaquim phœnix too this film however like the real accomplishments of one of the greatest strategists in our common european past is best consigned to history
Nov 23 2023,negative,this movie was garbage my gf and i endured this in an imax theater we walked out 23 of the way through terrible script wooden acting bad cinematography
Nov 23 2023,negative,very weird and awkward film clearly the director of this the movie hated napoleon its not entertaining like gladiator or brave heart besides a few descent battle scenes majority of the movie is basically a terrible soap opera between napoleon and josephine if this film isnt for napoleon fans history nerds or ridley scott fans who is this film made for 
Nov 23 2023,negative,expecting a war epic based on the previews and the large ice battle scene what the movie was really about was a story about marriage and an emperor who could not have a heir the story was disjoined with little true connections between subplots with okay but not well thought out war scenes     beware  disturbing sex scene early in the film that will leave audiences disgusted if you are sensitive to those things     stay away much better options out there dont waste your money
Nov 23 2023,positive,the movie is okay good cast good settings and good effects but lets be honest we were all excited for the battles and the action and the movie is 80 romance with josephine 10 dialogue and 10 percent battles
Nov 23 2023,negative,the big theme of the movie was him laying pipe they showed a minor amount of battles and could have showed more but instead of it being war focused they focused on him laying pipe
Nov 23 2023,negative,this movie needs to get exiled to isle of elba along with napoleon
Nov 23 2023,negative,everything about this film is disappointing we should have left after the first hour its just plain bad save your time and money i would like to see it in the theater where the people who gave it five stars saw it because the theater obviously provides free acid to their customers
Nov 23 2023,negative,there was no story from my perspective  very much like watching a movie with car chases every 15 minutes only it was battle scenes instead of car chases  actors were great  this just seemed like a bunch of battle scenes with some attempt at a story line between the battles  some may really like this movie  it didnt appeal to me
Nov 23 2023,positive,would highly recommend because everything of ridley scott and his films are amazing they introduce the movie assets and really keep it simple and yet so much interesting w film ridley keep making good films
Nov 23 2023,positive,some ppl are just so hard to please when it comes to good movies and as well maybe because they could not be on their stupid cell phone for almost 3 hrs by their review  maybe as well they do not care so much for history either  maybe they just have a low attention span    forgetting some ridiculous reviews i just noticed this movie delivered on so many regards and levels  you just need some attention span and patience to enjoy as yes almost 3 hrs    set design 10 out of 10  cinematography a 9 to 95  costumes 11 out of 10    phoenixs performance a very solid 85  direction 9  overall 9 out of 10      just be prepared to watch this full length epic and maybe drink lots less fluids like this one lady who went not just once to the washroom at the theatre but twice and then you miss many key points in the film  i always can sit through a movie from start to finish and never miss any part of the story    i really enjoyed the battle scenes and historical significance of it all
Nov 23 2023,positive,true to historical facts with little embellishment somber look at war in accurate detail great portrayal of napoleon
Nov 23 2023,positive,this movie is the greatest historical epic of all time its a masterpiece and among scotts best films everything about it is perfect and the battle scenes and their accurate recreations are mesmerizing see it on the largest screen you can 
Nov 23 2023,positive,good movie but not the great it couldve pj miscast  too old early too sulky later too much joséphine the english version of a great frenchman done in the style of kubricks barry lyndon
Nov 23 2023,negative,a steaming pile of horse manure the made napoleon into a meme
Nov 23 2023,negative,unfortunately the movie glosses over important parts of napoleons career and ignores others completely  this movie couldve been so much better but just tries to do too much curious choices about what to include and what not to include that makes the movie feel incomplete and truly does a poor job of depicting napoleons life
Nov 23 2023,positive,i dont know much about his story but they made him look like a clown more so than the brilliant strategist that he was
Nov 23 2023,negative,ridiculous acting and horrendous moronic dialogue  we walked out of the theatre less than an hour into this hot mess of a film
Nov 23 2023,negative,someone needs to tell the emperor he has no clothes in this case someone needs to tell ridley scott he has no movie honestly the biggest let down of the year joaquin phoenix tried his best to carry this movie ultimately his shoulder strength proved insufficient
Nov 23 2023,positive,good entertainment not too sure how accurate the movie is but was definitely worth watching
Nov 23 2023,positive,ridley scotts cinematography with joaquin phoenix ends up being another must watch epic joaquin phoenix plays napoleon a french general and emperor who must decide between conquering or being a great husband every battle is top tier and never shies away from gore the third act does kind of lack thought as it ends rather abruptly joaquin phoenix does make napoleon much more intriguing as his improvising is astonishing once again
Nov 23 2023,positive,historical inaccuracies would be forgivable if in service of something but the end product is not worth the amount of historical blunders in order to compress this story into 2 12 hours this couldve worked either across multiple movies or across a 5 season hbo series but not in one go the result is a confused poorly paced breakneck flyover of napoleons life and the greater geopolitical context of europe at the time which we only got glimpses of waterloo 1970 stands vastly superior telling only a fraction of the story
Nov 23 2023,positive,i was sort of bored in spots and was ready for the movie to end
Nov 23 2023,positive,thought the movie was well paced and balanced unsure why many thought it too short felt very well rounded of course left much to the viewer to put together on their own but with a basic understanding of the context the movie will certainly be plenty to get past supposed gaps in the story and focus on ridleys interpretation of his subject matter though comical at times ridleys napoleon is not the characature so many critics claim him to be rather he is man fundamentally driven by those things dearest to him and whose character is rightfully disconnected with the more polished upbringing of the nobles of europe it is strange that the humanization of napoleon should cause so many  romanisizers pain overall great acting camera work and set design
Nov 23 2023,negative,really did a disservice to napoleons legacy you would not come away from this movie feeling that he was the greatest general of all time thats literally what hes known for glossed over his military career
Nov 23 2023,positive,a feast of a film a glorious antidote to superhero fatigue this might be scotts grand exclamation mark in the twilight of his career its astonishing that he got this made in 2023    in some ways this film feels like it might be to kubricks neverwas napoleon project that spielbergs a i was to its own kubrickian roots    phoenix is definitely playing it in the spirit of barry lyndon  hes doing the comedyofmanners thing and even letting his joaquinphreakphlag fly high i gotta imagine the threestooges noises to instigate sex were strictly his improve    yet the battle scenes here these are next level these effects these stagings  its simply the best that practical  cgi have to offer in 2023 or any year this movie is a true marvel    ridley definitely deserves a place in the oscarbestdirector convo id be as bold to say give scott his long belated best director win this year keep nolan hungry
Nov 23 2023,positive,i thought the movie was thoroughly well made i was able to follow along with the story the cast did a tremendous job portraying the characters the battle sequences were well shot i would definitely watch this movie again
Nov 23 2023,negative,visually entertainingthe acting was subpar
Nov 23 2023,negative,this film is very ridiculous and doesnt seem like it came from a real story and what kind of crazy vision is ridley scotts for the love of god why give freedom to a guy who doesnt even know what hes doing anymore the characters for me are also weak and seem like npcs without personality the battles are very good and this is probably one of the only positive points of the film i hope the producers said theres nothing we can do when they saw the result final 4510
Nov 23 2023,positive,as close as well get to stanley kubricks napolean masterfully done had a good time cant wait for the extended cut on apple tv if you liked barry lyndon youll love this
Nov 23 2023,positive,movie was good a few of the battle scenes were excellent however it jumped around too much and didnt build up the drama that we wouldve expected way too much time spent on josephine this movie had a lot of potential
Nov 23 2023,negative,massive disappointment i almost walked out of the theater no narrative arc just a tired downhill loosely biographical slog the story largely focuses on napoleon and josephines messy marriage but with no real purpose or payoff the occasional battle scenes display zero tactics just a disjointed mess the brilliance of austerlitz is only depicted with a couple horse charging out of some trees to attack the flank and save the day any victories are glossed over as quickly as possible to get to his defeats this was clearly made by a man who hated napoleon but to what end people who love napoleon will be enraged everyone else will just be bored
Nov 23 2023,negative,acting was not bad at all but the storyline was sloppy with no flow  very slow did not need to be as long as it was
Nov 23 2023,negative,slow boring monotonous fell asleep twice
Nov 23 2023,positive,joaquin phoenix is amazing as napoleon   not too long had my attention from beginning to end
Nov 23 2023,negative,cant get that 2 12 hours back slow pace poor choices in cinematography never gave us a chance to care about the characters joaquin phoenix gave a flat uninspired performance skip it
Nov 23 2023,positive,the battle scenes were excellent they made him seem in capable of affection feel that was the hollywood touch
Nov 23 2023,negative,long boring there is so much more to napoleon than this movie  came close to walking out after the first 2 hours
Nov 23 2023,negative,very little dialogue wikipedia is more informative
Nov 23 2023,positive,really well done movie for tough subject manner impossible to satisfy all but certainly satisfied this viewer
Nov 23 2023,positive,slightly underwhelmed  scott needed to educate the population with no prior knowledge of napoleons historic and internal endeavors on one hand so the first 40 minutes dragged and then  on the other hand to give some excitement to a movie trying to cover such a vast list of battles let alone the civic laws and infrastructure napoleon created which werent touched upon  the acting was good and also a little shallow at times the film seemed to lack the gravitas for such  a great historic figure worth seeing but lower your expectations for a better experience
Nov 23 2023,negative,boring  i walked out
Nov 23 2023,positive,accurate to history and well portrayed
Nov 23 2023,negative,this feels like the firstever script written by an ai that skimmed wikipedia article before writing it  lack of story cohesive theme or anything to glue all the random scenes together its all very apparentwaste of time the scene with the mummy felt more intimate than the entire storyline between josephine and bonapart
Nov 23 2023,positive,the movie didnt have a very rich plot  the love story lacked
Nov 23 2023,negative,impressively bad within the first 10 minutes i wanted to walk out whole movie has an extremely odd vibe to it the audience will leave the movie less informed than when entering how was spain or any of napoleons marshalls not mentioned once
Nov 23 2023,negative,i wish it was well written and acted it is very comedic and i dont think it was the intent it wasnt very authentic and couldnt we have gotten a few great french actors the battle screens shouldnt have been the best aspect of the movie
Nov 23 2023,negative,too long all scenes disjointed love story nonexistent no chemistry between napoleon and josephine no passion throughout the entire movie
Nov 23 2023,positive,the battle scenes were good but the characters outside of napoleon and his wife josephine were not interesting  the movie could have been edited more to reduce the length
Nov 23 2023,positive,excellent acting marvelous imagery of the sweep of battlefields  the ending with the casualty numbers keeps napoleon from being a person to emulate
Nov 23 2023,positive,overall the movie was really enjoyable as someone who enjoys history and is currently majoring in history i liked how accurate it was joaquin phoenix did an excellent job portraying napoleon i thought that the marriage trouble between napoleon and josephine was a sign of attention to detail i enjoyed every moment despite the long run time
Nov 23 2023,negative,the worst movie i have ever seen bar none i asked my dad and nephew you ready at the one hour mark they were eager to follow me out
Nov 23 2023,negative,long slow expecting epic film gladiator brave heart not even close  for as long and drawn out as it was leaves a lot out and confusing  wait and watch it on apple tv
Nov 23 2023,positive,movie was good but not amazing nothing special battle scenes were epic even if not historically accurate rest of the movie was fine definitely not a must see in the theaters
Nov 23 2023,positive,excellent movie with unbelievable battle scenes   probably too smart for the american audience
Nov 23 2023,neutral,this is not gladiator  not even close the cinematography and battle sequences are noteworthy but the story is superficial and stale never breaking beneath the surface to real motivations there is consistently no context for the characters or the story it is therefore impossible to feel any emotions for the characters or the events that they go through views like a visual reading of encyclopedia brittanica a docudrama at best a waste of millions of dollars at worst a sad exit if this ends up being ridleys last film
Nov 23 2023,positive,vava voom vanessa kirby  joaquin phoenix is terrific he had an aura about him such that his napoleon at winning felt good and his napoleon at losing felt down during all of this and somewhere around two or three minutes into the movie i saw ridley scotts napoleon on screen and not joaquin phoenix portrayal of napoleon   the soundtrack was great too   of course you go for the battle scenes and they do deliver nevertheless i could have used more storytelling surrounding either the coup or the austrianrussians or the english nothing too immersive that it distracts from the overall package
Nov 23 2023,positive,the length of the movie was extremely long and didnt have much action however it was a good movie
Nov 23 2023,positive,good acting but very lengthy battle scenes joaquin phoenix was excellent but movie was rather slow moving
Nov 23 2023,positive,very good movie  liked the history and ability to follow the timeline
Nov 23 2023,positive,disliked the sex scenes those minutes could have been devoted to more historical context i hoped that the would have included king louie but they jumped ahead past that and excluded the extent of oppression of catholics in the french revolution it was entertaining and i recommend watching it
Nov 23 2023,positive,was not accurate to the the real napoleon
Nov 23 2023,positive,joaquin phoenix for oscar  french scenery  battle scenes excellent
Nov 23 2023,positive,great movie i have never ever seen battles of this magnitude in a movie before
Nov 23 2023,negative,im convinced the director has never read anything about napoleon other than borderline british propaganda and has almost 0 understanding of the battles military and political but hey at least he got the thing right about him losing at waterloo and josephine being unfaithful
Nov 23 2023,positive,i liked and so did my wife   yes little skewed to pure history but what movie isnt   its more about giving g us insight to two famous characters from history
Nov 23 2023,positive,not totally accurate on battlefields but well done overall
Nov 23 2023,negative,too long it went no where in time it could have condensed by half and still be boring    there was naturally a lot of brutality being a war epic but the in humane treatment of horse deaths was to much if it wasnt war it was sex scenes jp acted well never want to see again
Nov 23 2023,positive,napoleon was well done and i learned things that i didnt know about him and the turmoil in france
Nov 23 2023,positive,joachin phoenix did not seem the right choice for the role  he plays damaged fine ut man absolutely no charisma  i spent the movie trying to figure out why people would follow this character    also far too much attention on josephine and their broken relationship  absolutely no time spent on worldbuiding for france ala 1810  no napoleonic law code  no pennisula war  only 2 battles were paid attention to  austerlitz and waterloo  it was all weird
Nov 23 2023,positive,sir your movie is a flop what should we do napolean there is nothing we can do
Nov 23 2023,negative,horrible the movie itself was beautiful visually at least and the actors were amazing everything else sucked imagine being a world threatening conqueror who both ended and defined an entire era and someone makes a whole movie about you fumbling the bag w ur wife they graze over every single battle ever this movie shouldve been named josephine since she was the entire plot they didnt touch on any battles all they had were 2 min of a battle and then the rest of the time he was was begging josephine for her approval 90 of the movie was abt her clearly no research was done as they even had the wrong flags at some point obvi its a movie so it doesnt have to be 100 accurate but for over half of it to be wrong is crazy they did no research with how inaccurate it was in the trailer you see battle glory a genius but once you see the actual movie its all about his wife sucking some guy off
Nov 23 2023,positive,a little disjointed the waterloo battle was not accurate
Nov 23 2023,negative,oooff what a disappointment on the movie itself the scenario is more than shaky and some moments that should have been epic are poorly delivered on the content itself you can only be disappointed by this ridiculous take on napoleon itself and mixing up all historical moments i mean if you dont care about history and what really happened dont take historical characters just invent your own
Nov 23 2023,positive,a possibly unique take on bonaparte from one of the all time greatest directors first the good joaquin phoenix literally is napoleon bonaparte he exudes arrogance and brilliance vulnerability and immense power at the same time oscar nomination absolutely second the battle scene of austerlitz is unbelievably good at the end of the scene i was literally feeling the kind of fear that the rest of europe at the time had for bonaparte an amazing piece of cinema i cant recall a time in any other film where i genuinely had fear of the character a hair on the back of the neck moment for me for me the only time in the film where the audacity and brilliance of bonaparte came through as an utterly brilliant single minded genius without regard for life or death just the victory a stunning piece of cinema brilliant work from ridley scott    the downsides for me too much emphasis on the relationship with josephine yes i understand why its in the film yes its important to understand bonaparte and yes the acting is superb in every scene but i think on balance it was overegged for me it kind of lessens the achievements of him kind of makes him seem like a lovestruck puppy at times maybe rename the film napoleaon and josephine which i think would be okay having said that all those scenes are beautifully played and acted the battle of waterloo perhaps the most important battle on european soil until the somme and certainly the most important in political terms for europes continuing issues seemed like an afterthought bonaparte looked like an out played hasbeen with a ragtag army who were outmatched not at all how it played out in reality and if it had gone differently europe would look so much different now    but overall minor points from me really because this a really really good and brilliantly made beautuful cinematography excellent film for those who either know love hate or have no idea who napoleon bonaparte was if you are the latter and know nothing of napoleon it stands on its own as a brilliant study of obsession which is what bonaparte is and remanis so    in summary  it would be 5 stars but for too much josephine best battle scenes i seen in recent times great acting great direction very highly recommended just go see for yourself    ps at ridley scott  you should make a film called austerlitz just about the battle but i understand youre busy
Nov 23 2023,positive,a good performance from joaquin phoenix a very grand epic picture
Nov 23 2023,positive,it was okay a lot about sex life of napoleon and josephine not much about rise to power or war general felt rushed maybe better for hbonetflixshowtime miniseries
Nov 23 2023,negative,this the my most anticipated film of the year and i had very high hopes they totally missed the mark for me it was just ok unfortunately
Nov 23 2023,positive,this film was visually pleasing and used a lot of famous paintings as a reference point the film should have been called josephine and napoleon it doesnt explore napoleons policies political philosophy or world view the battle scenes are well staged and refreshingly the narrative is told chronologically however joaquin phoenixs performance was underwhelming and i generally am a fan of his work the dialogue was thin and there was something almost campy about the screenplay ridley scott like napoleon needs to bow out gracefully and not push his luck he has made several classics but this is not one of them
Nov 23 2023,negative,the direction for this movie is disappointing and distasteful
Nov 23 2023,positive,ridley scotts movie genius shines once more in this historical epic perfectly showcasing both history and the best cinematography the likes of which have never seen before
Nov 23 2023,negative,atrocious  i wish i could have 3 hours of my life back please save yourself from this movie
Nov 23 2023,negative,doesnt capture napoleon doesnt capture josephine doesnt capture france doesnt capture the era so bad like if the history channel had 100 million to make an expensive documentary total phone in job by all involved
Nov 22 2023,neutral,it seemed disjointed disconnected and oddly paced the any accent goes approach was an odd choice and there was a substantial lack of character development i guess it was a gory love story not exactly sure after what felt like a movie that couldshould have been edited to cut out at least an hour
Nov 22 2023,negative,i made an account to leave this review im a huge history nerd and i was really excited to see a proper big budget movie about napoleon its clear ridley scott and his team did their research but i have some bad news for them no one wants a movie about napoleons slut wife we dont like napoleon because he was a simp i dont want to see that its boring did it happen yes do we care no show me the battles not just the blood and action but show us his tactics show us how he won battles oh by the way theres very little use of muskets in this movie theyd rather fix bayonets and charge in blind     the battle of austerlitz is reduced to a 510 sequence and borodino is literally a few shots of a cavalry charge we dont get to see why napoleon was master of europe     in short if you want a good napoleon movie thats honestly more mature and doesnt have pointless and embarrassing sex scenes in it go watch the 60s waterloo movie
Nov 22 2023,negative,first off the film was bad napoleon made no sense as a character he was inconsistent appearing to be both a horny imbecile and an immaculate tactician governed entirely by his need to impress josephine he set europe on fire in five on screen skirmishes   the films pace was plodding the characters were all characatuers was it supposed to be a comedy it made me laugh 5 times only once where i think i was supposed to     it was tediously focused on napoleons home life and his weird relationship with his mum his obsession with josephine is accurate but god is it twisted to something bizarre     odd boring unintentionally funny historically diabolically inaccurate the action is a mess
Nov 22 2023,negative,movie tried to cover too much time in 25 hours historical accuracy questionable
Nov 22 2023,positive,ridley scott brings another historical epic to the screen this time with joaquin phoenix and vanessa kirby telling the tale of napoleon  josephine bonaparte the film tells both stories of napoleons achievements on the battlefield as well as his volatile and unstable relationship with josephine my take from the film is the relationship is more central to the story than the battles both phoenix and kirby shine in their respective roles each taking turns at being the domineering figure in the relationship at any one time phoenix in particular plays the role with little emotion having either an overconfident case of his sht doesnt stink or an apparent apathy hes wonderful as napoleon a historical film being told in 2 hours and 38 minutes it hits the highlights of his life however knowing scott and his pension for extendeddirectors cuts even hearing a rumor that a 4hour version could soon be made available im curious to see more from this story as i was quite entertained throughout but sadly this version left me wanting more
Nov 22 2023,negative,they spent over 23 of the movie about the wife and portrayed him as the biggest simp in the world and that he left egypt only because of his wife and the 3 battles were very bad there was nothing correct about any of the battles
Nov 22 2023,positive,movie was in my opinion amazing and beautiful the battles were beautifully shot although very inaccurate to how they happened historically but i expected this going in acting was superb and the costumes next level cant wait for the 4 hour cut
Nov 22 2023,negative,loved the performances but movie was just ok
Nov 22 2023,positive,i have been looking forward to this film for a while but having read the critic reviews i was a bit apprehensive but i have to say i really enjoyed it the film is so well made with gorgeous costumes great scenery and amazing battle scenes its also quite funny in places with some very odd sex scenes the film is quite long at 2 hours 38 minutes and there is dialogue as well as action so maybe not a film for the marvel generation or anyone with a low attention span you could nit pick about some factual inaccuracies but if you like going to the cinema and just switching off for a few hours you will enjoy 1010 5 stars
Nov 22 2023,negative,i cant believe it was made by the director of gladiator we walked out
Nov 22 2023,positive,i enjoyed the movie theres an enormous amount of history and events to cover the vehicle they use to advance the story is the love affair with josephine all the events of the world happen around that relationship the movie opens at the time of robespierre and the terror this corsican officer scores a brilliant victory at toulon is promoted to general and the rest as they say is history  when napoleon first took over theres a scene where josephines son comes to request his fatherss sword as a memory his father was a military officer executed during the terror this is how napoleon meets josephine he grants the request but his first response was we dont allow citizens to have weapons the movie is a little overly focused on the romance i thought there are also several witty scenes that generate laughter  one thing i was surprised to see is they had scandal  sheet tabloids back then as josephines embarrassing love affair was plastered on french headlines the movie did a good job showing the battle scenes up to and including the defeat at waterloo they portrayed his selfcoronation well bringing out one of the anomalies of napoleon  the successor to the french revolution still wanted to have the popes blessing for his royaltylike coronation they could have developed napoleon as a character a little more there were scenes in which he mentions my destiny and there are words thanking providence that has brought me here but it does not delve more deeply into how his insatiable sense of divine destiny drove his relentless conquests given the breadth of events that had to be covered the movie provided a thumbnail overview but i the end i still dont know who this napoleon still it was engaging and well produced so i generously give it four stars 
Nov 22 2023,negative,2 hours and 30 minutes of puffs and caricature with no substance and entirely no character development failed to even flesh out the titular character beyond the 2 dimensional talented narcissist    battle scenes made no strategic and little narrative sense for casual viewers and brimming with historical inaccuracies for history buffs    a long dreary drag of tropes and carictures towards the end mimicking scenes from bondarchuks work whilst failing in even imitation    a long trailer only not a movie
Nov 22 2023,positive,too far from historic accuracy  too much ridiculous sex   phoenix did his part     the sound was sometimes poor
Nov 22 2023,neutral,underwhelming borderline boring at times focuses on josephine love story more than the risefall of napoleon and at times awkward and cringey had potential to be so much better than it was the trailer sets you up for a dramatic exciting performance the film doesnt follow up on it
Nov 22 2023,negative,while it shows napoleons rise to power it doesnt really explain how  the battle scenes are impressive but wildly inaccurate and disappointing when compared with 1970s movie waterloo for example  where were the french columns against the thin red line  phoenix is great but everything else just feels a bit superficial
Nov 22 2023,negative,i dont know how i feel we had a group of 11 men show up last night opening night hoping for a gladiator caliber movie its not a manly or inspiring movie like gladiator like we were expecting instead it was a weak man movie tired awkward cringe at some parts phoenix is great actor and director ridley scott had some great war scenes in the snow and ice good acting story was good  i was just hoping to walk out of theater inspired and moved instead our group was like umm it was okay
Nov 22 2023,positive,i enjoyed this movie i recently became interested in napoleonic history i imagine it must be tough to followunderstand sometimes if you dont know the history more enjoyable if you do although movie embellished and glossed over at times doggy style sex scenes were a bit much but expected for a theatrical movie
Nov 22 2023,negative,it should have been three movies because of the grand story to tell
Nov 22 2023,negative,a mess which couldnt decide what about napoleon to focus going in multiple directions and failing to deliver on any of them
Nov 22 2023,negative,too much focus was put on his relationship and in turn made the film drag on and extend the movie longer than it shouldve been this was also easily the most average performance of joaquins career thus far
Nov 22 2023,positive,first as a fervent military historian and a military leader myself we need to get the negatives out of the way  do not get me wrong  i really like phoenix as a person and an actor but he nor the filmmakers got napoleon correct in personality or image  napoleon was always a boyish looking man from his young days up until he was older this was not represented well by choosing phoenix  phoenix did not portray napoleons personality very well  napoleon was actually way more quiet and discerning with the common gaze of a battle weary commander  a deep thinker reason for his successes he was not prone to be as emotional and irrational as shown in the film  nor passionate  he was ambitious but not overly emotional or passionate  he was also not 100 dedicated to france or to his troops as shown in the movie  napoleon treated his troops and saw them as cannon fodder for his own means and personal glory  which is why he took huge risks and huge losses not really caring about them  to be honest if you want to see a better version of napoleon with both looks and personality watch the actor in the first bill and ted movie  lol  way closer  that guy nailed it historically  also if you watch phoenix as napoleon commanding his troops in battle he does not speak with a historically accurate commanders tone  this is wear phoenix fails in acting  however this movie is still very good  5 stars and a very good watch  very entertaining  beautifully done  well worth your money and time  the napoleon inconsistencies do not really ruin it  it is another scott masterpiece as usual  this film will likely get an oscar not likely for phoenix but maybe for cinematography or score writing etc
Nov 22 2023,positive,great action sequences as long as you dont expect historical accuracy and glad to see it wasnt a whitewashing of the character good performances no one nearly wears clothes like vanessa kirby
Nov 22 2023,positive,joaquin phoenix was underwhelming as napoleon and the battle scenes werent well done i expected a lot more from waterloo
Nov 22 2023,positive,pheonix is great in it when he doesnt speak but an american napolean a english director making napolean into a silly character the film could gave been so much better disappointing
Nov 22 2023,positive,great presentation  i know a lot more about napoleon now
Nov 22 2023,positive,there are a lot of personalities that need to be figured in for a complete picture  talleyrand is whole another story
Nov 22 2023,positive,great acting score cinematography
Nov 22 2023,negative,clumsy in diplomatic relations awkward in interpersonal relationships insecure anxious and extremely vulnerable the story that ridley scott tells in napoleon alternates the greatness of the undertakings with the ordinary smallness of those who conceived and completed them the most obvious and relevant part of napoleon is in fact how joaquin phoenix gives the character his natural restlessness the one he brings to all roles and it is not what we are used to thinking of great historical figures especially leaders instead this napoleon always appears weak and fragile to us despite everything he conquers and the skill with which he does it the movie is too long
Nov 22 2023,positive,need more information about napoleon childhood or how he became soldier
Nov 22 2023,negative,walked out half way through if youre going to make historical fiction at least make it interesting  i hope ridley scott wakes up with a stiff neck tomorrow
Nov 22 2023,negative,very disappoiting  not a terrible movie  its just  okay
Nov 22 2023,negative,my god that was bad it was 90 about him and his wifethe rest was extremely historically inacurate nonsenseduring the battle of waterloo a british soldier with a rifle from the 1700s apparently has a shot to snipe napoleon from about a mile away but wellington says nobecause it is unsportsman like lol and then at the end napoleon gets on his horse and charges into the british d if you want to watch a historically accurate verson of napoleon with good acting just watch the 1970s waterloo on youtube because this movie is so bad i saw people walking out halfway through and i wanted to join them
Nov 22 2023,negative,this movie turnedd out to be a terrible waste of my time couldnt wait to see it end
Nov 22 2023,positive,excellent movie well acted and very entertaining joachim was briniest
Nov 22 2023,positive,it was engaging and interesting even with the long runtime
Nov 22 2023,positive,ridley scotts epics usually have a fanatic sense of size and scale im a huge fan of joaquin phoenix and i find stories about infamous historical figures extremely interesting this movie was tailormade for me and while definitely good the film has definite flaws   the battles are incredible the acting is great the cinematography feels massive and the music feels heavy  but the romance feels wooden the politics feel rushed and while the characters are intriguing you dont really care about them  on a visual and technical level this film is an absolute work of art however from a storytelling perspective the film has so many structural issues that it holds it back from reaching its most epic potential
Nov 22 2023,positive,literally my first thought as i left the theatre was wow what a lovely film yes there were battles but the film was not all blood and guts it was really character led great acting from a great cast have read some of the negative reviews but in the words of another ridley scott character  was i entertained  yes i was  go and make your own mind up i for one loved it 
Nov 22 2023,positive,i recently had the privilege of viewing the latest cinematic rendition of the life of napoleon featuring the exceptional talents of joaquin phoenix and vanessa kirby this film not only met but surpassed my highest expectations delivering a cinematic experience that seamlessly blended historical accuracy outstanding performances and meticulous craftsmanship    joaquin phoenixs portrayal of napoleon bonaparte was without exaggeration a masterclass in acting his ability to encapsulate the multifaceted nature of this historical figure from the military strategist to the complex human beneath the facade was both nuanced and captivating phoenix brought a level of intensity and authenticity to the role that elevated the narrative and showcased his unparalleled acting prowess    vanessa kirby in the role of josephine exhibited a level of grace and emotional depth that complemented phoenixs performance with finesse the chemistry between the two actors was palpable adding a layer of authenticity to the historical narrative and making the onscreen relationship a central and compelling aspect of the film    the cinematography and production design of the movie were exemplary the meticulous attention to historical detail in recreating the settings whether the grandeur of palaces or the intensity of battlefields demonstrated a commitment to visual excellence this attention to detail not only transported the audience to the napoleonic era but also enriched the narrative by immersing viewers in the historical context    the script demonstrated a careful balance between historical accuracy and narrative intrigue the dialogue was sharp and intelligent offering both information and emotional resonance the pacing was deliberate allowing the story to unfold naturally and ensuring a seamless engagement with the complex historical events portrayed    complementing the exceptional performances and production values the films soundtrack was a standout component the music underscored key moments enhancing the emotional impact and contributing to the overall immersive experience of the narrative    in conclusion the new napoleon film featuring joaquin phoenix and vanessa kirby stands as a cinematic triumph it successfully weaves together outstanding performances breathtaking visuals and a compelling narrative to create a film that is both historically enlightening and emotionally affecting whether ones interest lies in history or fine filmmaking this movie is a noteworthy addition to the cinematic landscape the combined talents of joaquin phoenix and vanessa kirby underpinned by meticulous craftsmanship make this rendition of napoleons story a compelling and memorable cinematic achievement
Nov 22 2023,negative,this was an absolute failure of a movie napoleon effectively tells the audience nothing about its namesake when it does it presents crude falsifications   the historical innacuracies are many but the most concerning is simply that napoleon himself is never actually depicted as the mercurial witty charismatic and driven leader that he was   the movie feels like an attempt of character assassination   nothing can be savaged from this even phoenix a brilliant actor was absolutely not fit for this role or told to act in such an uncanny way
Nov 22 2023,negative,how could this be soooooooo boring gave it two stars because costumes were excellent sure was glad to see waterloo
Nov 22 2023,positive,the main characters were a bit stiff but the story was accurate and the photography was great
Nov 22 2023,negative,absolutely repugnant
Nov 22 2023,positive,good but not great incredible acting and cinematography simply incredible the story as many have said was a bit slow at times to much of the romance story and not enough of the battles definitely some major historical inaccuracies but still a good film regardless
Nov 22 2023,negative,mid action film with little to nothing new in the genre dark color grading to add missing mood and atmosphere from scenes and actingwriting basically the laugh track of poor movies only thing historically accurate about this biopic is the calendar if you must see it wait to see it on streams
Nov 22 2023,negative,the movie focuses on his relationship with josephine and loses balance in doing so
Nov 22 2023,positive,the movie is too long and moves very slowly the battle scenes are good but the character development for both napoleon and josephine is lacking overall i was not a big fan of the movie
Nov 22 2023,negative,soooooo disappointed j phoenix was flat and hoarse throughout the movie i saw gladiator 30 times i could barely sit through this one once ridley scott needed hans zimmer on this one too 
Nov 22 2023,positive,napoleon was a complex character phoenix at his best funny romantic brutal what i expect from scott
Nov 22 2023,negative,it tries to be funny exploitation  except it wants to be serious in war scenes  if it were a war documentary  it would have been a decent one but not being faithful to material is mockumentary enough
Nov 22 2023,negative,this movie is horrifically disappointing as a lover of history i fully expected to get a highlight reel of napoleons life based on key moments but never once did i think they would spend the majority of the movie insulting him at the altar of josephine my goodness we missed out on the italian and peninsular campaigns in order to get a scene of napoleon yapping like a little puppy please do the history community a favor and watch waterloo instead
Nov 22 2023,positive,in ridley scotts film napoleon directed with flair joaquin phoenix delivers a stellar performance as the calm hilarious and calculated character the movie unfolds with gripping scenes including a dramatic horse explosion and napoleons ascent over a british wall showcasing both resilience and strategic brilliance    as the narrative unfolds napoleon rises to power leveraging cannons from captured ships a government officials illfated unalived  attempt adds a dark twist leading to a guillotine fate napoleons complex relationship with josephine portrayed with humor by phoenix navigates love infidelity and the challenges of leadership    the film brilliantly captures historical battles displaying the sheer scale of warfare especially the mesmerizing canon fire scenes phoenixs portrayal of napoleon balances seriousness and humor making for a compelling character the film doesnt shy away from the awkward realities of history    the biographical elements are seamlessly woven into the narrative avoiding the typical pitfalls of biopics comedy romance and action blend harmoniously providing an immersive cinematic experience while napoleons military exploits take center stage the movie doesnt shy away from his personal struggles adding depth to the character    despite minor quibbles such as a couple of awkwardly placed sx scenes the film succeeds in delivering an engaging portrayal of napoleons life overall id rate napoleon 85 out of 10 for its realism entertainment value and wellbalanced storytelling addition of apple and sonys columbia pictures to the production adds prestige to an already stellar cinematic gem
Nov 22 2023,negative,some aspects were good  some of the battle sequences were tecnically well done but overall the movie felt oddly shallow  when being a biopic about one of the most important and influential men who ever existed there must have been a lot of interesting takes and stories to tell but instead it devolves into a partfarce part melodrama that had no weight i think its an ok movie  if only because 2023 is shaping up as the worst year in film history and at least it isnt a sequeltprequelremakereboot or superhero nonsense but i would wait until streaming if i hadnt already seen it
Nov 22 2023,negative,awfully boring are people supposed to actually find this entertaining
Nov 22 2023,negative,the historical inaccuracies were so horrific i almost walked out of the movie theater multiple times waterloo was interpreted so badly i actually did walk out of the theater the movie starts out so well and then proceeds down a path of disjointed boredom combined with incredibly poorly interpreted battle scenes this film dances between dark comedy and bad history much like a drunk history episode do not waste your time or money
Nov 22 2023,negative,as a napoleonic wars buff i was so looking forward to this movie and all the new technology available today to create a movie that is realistic for battle scenes with hundreds of thousands i was so disappointed the costumes were spot on but other than stating a date and name it was so far from being accurate come on having napoleon riding his horse in front of his calvary at the british in waterloo everyone knows napoleon watched and gave orders at the battle from the back his general nay lead the charge the 1971 movies waterloo far better both in quality story and authenticity and it was made 52 years ago
Nov 22 2023,positive,beautiful film making about a difficult to capture man
Nov 22 2023,negative,this movie was a spoof and a mockery of an incredible life and period in history character development is horrific and does not form any of the characters well the background knowledge presented for characters and events is nowhere near sufficient enough to make you care about either the movie fails miserably in large part because it attempts to cover 22 years of a momentous life and period of history in 2 and a half hours instead of walking us through the catalyst that spurred the modern western world and a life of tremendous achievement for good and bad the movie drags us by the neck at a gallop mocking the man and painting the events as a unimportant blip of rage this was sad and abhorrent portrayal of one of histories greatest men and greatest events
Nov 22 2023,negative,i have never seen a movie who simultaneously failed at being a historical documentary a war story and a love story all at the same time it was originally a 4 hr movie cut to 25 hrs this should have been a six part series ridley scott fails to deliver continuity or character development enough to care about what happened during this 2 12 hour movie no plot no story just a whole lot of jump edits that do nothing to make you invested in the story at all joaquin phoenix gave the worst performance of his career making napoleon a great military tactioner and leader a bumbling jealous idiot played somewhere between the joker and the gladiator by the time an hour and a half rolled around half the audience was checking their watches and the other half fell asleep literally this is nothing short or an editing disaster this movie should have gone straight to streaming or dvd be prepared to see a lot of the joker in napoleon sad i have been looking forward to this movie for almost a year 
Nov 22 2023,negative,this movie was awful      no character development  no setting of the stage historically  it couldnt decide if it wanted to be a love story or a war movie so it did both incredibly poorly  the effectively took a mind map of ideas of what this movie should be about shot each of those ideas independently and then used finalcut pro to put them all together with whiteouts to move between each idea     without the character development you never felt anything for the relationship between napoleon and josephine  without the setup of the wars you get cut scenes of battles where you have no idea why the war is being fought or the strategic effort put into winning the battles      it felt like they wanted to get something out before thanksgiving so they could turn a quick buck
Nov 22 2023,positive,i thought juaquin phoenix did a fantastic job the movie was a bit slow at times however the fighting scenes were really good overall a great movie i just wish they didnt drag it so long gladiator is still my favorite with juaquin
Nov 22 2023,positive,he came from nothing he conquered everything    ridley scotts most recent epic napoleon was a beautiful film when it came to visuals set pieces and overall cinematography joaquin phoenix and vanessa kirby share the screen perfectly and show a lot of talentwhich comes to no surprise and amazing chemistry from a story standpoint i can understand that it is tough to illustrate all aspects of napoleons life into a reasonable length film and i am pleased with the outcome and highlights they decided to showcase his rise to emperor and fall to excile while dealing with his love josephine  however i will state that if they were to release an extended version i will not hesitate to watch that the visuals from this film were outstanding especially when it came to the battle sequences the feeling of being close to the battles and witnessing the gore and violence that followed was breathtaking the score and the cinematography were used brilliantly and at some points i had chills now the obvious issue spotted in the film that im sure most people are talking about goes to the lack of accents to help with the authenticity the fact that we were in france and not a single person spoke with a french accent was kind of a letdown    overall the film was a beautiful film that showcased some key moments in napoleons life and was entertaining to watch i can see the rating possible going up after a rewatch or if an extended version gets released to expand more on the life and events of napoleon
Nov 22 2023,positive,throughly enjoyed not as riveting as gladiator  but a good complete story finally hollywood is returning to entertaining versus rehashing tired stories
Nov 22 2023,positive,awesome movie action packed and excellent visual effects great acting as well
Nov 22 2023,negative,ridley scott englishman took historical dates and then made everything else up  outright lying at points to make sure the impression of napoleon left on the audience is as negative as possible rs made a movie to attack one mans ego but i think the one that needs to be put in check is ridleys
Nov 22 2023,positive,having perused a few reviews beforehand my expectations were set and the film met them adequately its a commendable piece though not reaching the pinnacle of greatness the filmmakers successfully humanized the mythic character of napoleon skillfully portraying him as a tangible and relatable figure the depiction of both the chaotic battleground and the intricacies of love within the film is noteworthy capturing these elements with a compelling realism
Nov 22 2023,positive,absolutely killer movie one of the best films ive ever seen great cinematography with really highlighting the great battles napoleon has won and the timeline in which they show what he has done was put together beautifully joaquin phoenix is absolutely amazing as napoleon no one could have done it better i really have nothing bad to say  about this movie and definitely recommend especially if you like action
Nov 22 2023,negative,so basically this proves marring a whore can destroy your empire dont marry the wrong woman if youre looking for historical accuracy dont look into this movie  napoleon in real life was a philosopher and extremely stoic    battle scenes are good showed his excellent military commander   though movie timeline moved extremely fast     men should still look up to napoleon as a role model on how to conquer what is yours do your research     just dont be a simp like what napoleon was in this movie       you can tell this movie was made by a feminist
Nov 22 2023,positive,napoleon is not a bad film by any means but that is not to say that it is great either i left the theater with a sense of disappointment there is a lot to love here the battle sequences are amazing with scale that i have yet to see in a film vanessa kirby and joaquin phoenix did amazing in their roles as josephine and napoleon respectfully the cinematography here is also amazing with many shots that are breathtaking the sets and costume design are also great here the score also perfectly sets the tone of many scenes i felt that the writing on display here was pretty hit or miss    there is also a lot to dislike here the pacing felt very odd with many scenes having me feel very underwhelmed in their length i felt that the jumping around from one point in time to another point in time felt very disorienting at points there were characters that i felt should have been fleshed out a lot more than they should have the humor in the film never really landed for me and sometimes felt as if they were underplaying a serious moment if felt like it was not taking itself very seriously in certain moments the emotional moments never really hit making certain scenes less impactful    overall napoleon may not be great but it remains a perfectly fine film that is still enjoyable in many moments but never captures the potential that it had
Nov 22 2023,neutral,tedious movie attempting to cut down a man many consider great in focusing primarily on embarrassing napoleon scott misses a great opportunity for an epic classic
Nov 22 2023,positive,do not listen to the critics 64 once again they had no idea what they were talking about its the best action movie of the year and one of the best epics of its era the sets were amazing the acting was outstanding and the writing was surprisingly perfect
Nov 22 2023,negative,amazing costumes and cinematography as usual for scott  but the story fails to impart anything about napoleon as a man and warfare in his time austerlitz was depicted by an infamous incident that may or may not have happened at the end of the battle when the allies were already in full retreat  after that scott might have flashed a montage of jena eylau friedland wagram to let you understand just why his troops remained loyal after he returned from elba  instead we go right into the disaster in russia to be told that was why he was deposed in reality the wars went on for 2 more years  there was so much interesting drama around waterloo and none of that was touched on they never had tents or trenches on the battlefield and napoleon never charged into battle since he became emperor napoleon was a military savant in the field but his skills as a person were somewhat limited i was hoping that would at least be brought out but alas
Nov 22 2023,neutral,the movie was good but there are some silly parts i think joaquin phoenix played a good self serving dictator war monger the lighting was terrible maybe to fit the period it was so dim i couldnt make out what was happening even when they were outside in daylight it was dim sometimes that was good not as gory im no historian but i think it was accurate
Nov 22 2023,negative,first two and a quarter hours sucked were uncomfortable and felt dry no story no plot no epic battles just a checklist for an rrated movie that shows total disregard for any audience enjoyment dont fall for the hype    absolutely terrible
Nov 22 2023,negative,advertised as a film to focus on the rise of napoleon bonaparte scotts napoleon is a rushed mess that constantly throws figures and events at the audience with the skill and tact of a toddler throwing food at the floor the lack of focus on napoleons military career the complete disregard of the italian campaign is especially disappointing is made only more disappointing by relegating everything in his career as derivative of an insecurity in his marriage it is impossible to not think of oliver stones alexander biopic after seeing scotts napoleon however for all the failings of stones biopic at least his enthusiasm for portraying an authentic and nuanced portrait of the macedonian conqueror came through as opposed to ridley scotts napoleon which comes across as tired bored and ultimately driven to make people despise bonaparte while this film will fail to sway the opinions of anyone with remote knowledge of napoleon he will undoubtedly earn their contempt for his bore of a film
Nov 22 2023,negative,choppy disjointed and bizarre thought i was going to see an epic on the scale of gladiator  dont waste your time in the theateror when it comes to your tv
Nov 22 2023,positive,this is a mostly entertaining yet odd film it doesnt tell us much about who napoleon really is the battle scenes are large beautiful and epic but the intimate scenes are strangely sophomoric and not well done its rather disappointing when you  ponder it afterwards and think about what it could have been
Nov 22 2023,positive,napoleon portrayed as a wimp with wife waterloo was a very weak scene movie jump around to  much a disappointing film after watching and hearing all the hype waterloo 1971 a far better film
Nov 22 2023,positive,this movie was epic dont miss out on this one watch it in the dolby theater at amc
Nov 22 2023,positive,kind of slow at times
Nov 22 2023,negative,i love historical movies but this was not good the biggest issue is the story and script you never understand peoples motivation or what the goal is the sets costumes acting and battle scenes are incredible but i found myself wanting for it to be over 40 minutes in
Nov 22 2023,negative,disappointing while usually brilliant phoenixs performance like the colors in the movie was dull
Nov 22 2023,neutral,some ok battle scenes and good costumes but overall not a good movie i like joaquin phoenix but in this role he brought nothing disjointed plot line with nothing helping you understand how we go from one event to the next supposedly a great love story was to be told in there somewhere but it wasnt developed and you come away not understanding it at all
Nov 22 2023,positive,ridley scotts napoleon is a lavishly crafted historical epic with strong turns from its leads but theres a disconnect from its central subject that keeps it from being a truly compelling film    full review    
Nov 22 2023,negative,there are a few interesting battle scenes but the completely unnecessary and offputting sex scenes and the poor music choices lots of eastern orthodox chants for a movie set in france made this a bust so much potential wasted in this film
Nov 22 2023,negative,the dak prescott of movie directors
Nov 22 2023,negative,so they managed to take a leader who was one of the most charismatic and determined leader france has ever put out and turn him into a barely vocal fool who appears to basically chance his way into victory the writer destroyed the very essence of why millions of people elected this man as their leader and followed him around the world to battle both in victory and in defeat ridley should be ashamed of himself for how he treated frances greatest military leader     my wife said she could not find a single reason to like either the character napoleon nor his wife and she enjoys the drama of reality tv that is how bad they have made the characters in this film reality tv has created more convincing stories and actors i rest my case
Nov 22 2023,positive,good historical movie
Nov 22 2023,negative,if you wanna see a movie about napoleon dont watch this one   this movie follows ridley scotts cookie cutter approach to history in that he mixes in heavy doses of his own prejudices and bad history much like kingdom of heaven  this movie is more propagandistic editorializing than history  its a series of unpleasant domestic problems one after another      in this movie we are taught that birds only poop on napoleon    that only napoleons hat falls off   that only napoleon trips and falls   that only napoleon burps    we also learn that every single crowned head of europe is cultured educated and absolutely brimming with etiquette all because of whose vgina they fell out of at birth    ridley scotts attempts to smear napoleon  alright heavy handed lack subtlety and are very childish and one dimensional      and just like kingdom of heaven scott throws in a million flags every time theres an army just a ridiculous number of flags at this guys lost his touch      in short this movie does not capthe excitement of a nation that is finally thrown off not only the oppressive yoke of a monarch but also of a memoriarous revolution
Nov 22 2023,positive,there is nothing we can do 
Nov 22 2023,negative,too long and too boring there are some epic scenes but due to the messy storyline you dont really get into it
Nov 22 2023,positive,from someone with a basic understanding of napoleons career i feel ridley scott does a great job portraying the life events and battles of the titular character i admire his decisions to use many extras and be lighter with cgi characters wardrobe and storyline were excellent i even brought a friend who hates history and she thought it was a great film as well looking forward to the directors cut
Nov 22 2023,positive,really enjoyed the movie story telling was awesome and war scenes at me focused on every detail pacing was a little slow at time but i film i really enjoyed
Nov 22 2023,positive,i was very excited because i always love what joaquin phoenix does and of course ridley scott has done some really great films along his career but alas this one drags on about half the film it focuses on napoleons relationship to his wifesomewhat boring the battles are very well filmed but not as much as i thought it more focuses on the relationship of him and his wife then he sends to his final location where he dies its under par from my point of birt view joaquin does a decent job not his best character which kind of surprised me its not his fault i dont think i think it was the way it was edited more than likely he still did a good job i still liked all the actors i liked all the action there just wasnt any great writing in the script no great lines and not enough action it was 2 12 hours if you cut out maybe an hour of his relationship it wouldve been better i give it about a five or six out of 10 not ridley scotts best work in my opinion which is unfortunate because i think it had a chance to be incredible if it wouldve focus more on the history and just had some better lines and more action i wanted to learn the history in an interesting dramatic fashion which didnt really happen
Nov 22 2023,positive,ridley scott was challenged to cover this historical epic story in a relative short time  i think it did a wonderful job with the glimpses of his life during his rise to power and eventual defeat  juaquin phoenix did a wonderful job portraying this complex historical figure
Nov 22 2023,neutral,the role was played well by joaquin however i think if bigger names it would be better performance it was of course historical again his road was played great it was not best but it was history and he has earned the role
Nov 22 2023,positive,really great phoenix has another amazing performance well shot and never a boring moment although it may have a long runtime it sure does not feel that way
Nov 22 2023,neutral,an entertaining insight into napoleons life and character action scenes were cool and the portrayal of napoleons tactics was amazing   only complaint are the numerous times that had explicit sexual moments that couldve be done with implied dialogue and given the same feeling didnt need to see that just like with opemheimer we get people love their spouses but i dont need to watch actors portray sexual acts i dont care just make war movies with dispute dialogue explosions and fighting
Nov 22 2023,positive,this was a good moovie i make trendsetting words 
Nov 22 2023,positive,joaquin is an amazing character fantastic movie
Nov 22 2023,positive,fantastic set designs and battle scenes but the story gets a little messy between trying to go back and forth between war and napoleons marriage this movie had the potential to be epic but instead it was just good
Nov 22 2023,positive,a production of epic proportions the battles are pretty awesome phoenix is amazing as napoleon i do feel josephine could have been better built character wise
Nov 22 2023,positive,an excellent historical telling of a very complicated and bizarre and powerful figure  some parts could have been left off completely or maybe just done once but over all it was a fine movie to see in the theater  however that being said it wouldnt be a big deal to wait for streaming
Nov 22 2023,positive,great performances great story being told blood like a tarantino movie
Nov 22 2023,positive,absolutely amazing finally an incredible movie with great action thats well written i didnt know much about napoleon till i saw this movie and what an incredible tale a self made man that built an empire i can only hope this movie is the beginning bringing great action flicks back to hollywood
Nov 22 2023,positive,expertly crafted epic some brutal animal deaths that came off offputting and strange choices was ridley scott trying to portray the brutality of war cruelty to animals seems almost a common motif in his work overall very enthralling and beautifully shot also well cast joaquin phoenix delivers as usual though possibly not quite his best
Nov 22 2023,positive,spectacular craftsmanship and massive achievement in every sense to say otherwise would almost be criminal one of the greatest films ever produced in the last few years 
Nov 22 2023,positive,loved the movie thought it was very funny and well written
Nov 22 2023,positive,fantastic epic great humor also need directors cut theatrical cut was to short
Nov 22 2023,negative,the life of napoleon is way too complex a story to tell in 25 hours  im not an expert on napoleon the man but this very much felt like cliff notes of his life small glimpses of a much more complex story  i am very well versed in napoleonic warfare and battles and from a historic perspective they were very atrocious and lack a lot of the complexity these battles had  while i wasnt expecting the 1970 waterloo approach to depicting the battles i was hoping for a much better telling and showcasing of napoleons genius as a general after all this is what hes most known for  it takes a very typical hollywood approach to things with the army general leading a charge on horseback on multiple occasions this was just so far from reality it left me feeling pretty bad about what couldve been a more captivating story showcasing his military genius  overall costumes were great and i could appreciate small details they got much closer to right hussars uniform and regalia a shot clearly showing what appears to be an empress dragoon soldier  overall i was fairly disappointed but worth a couple stars for even trying to tackle 2030 years of a very complex mans life and historic career in 23 hours
Nov 22 2023,negative,the rise and fall of napoleon is mere window dressing in this story about a longdistance relationship       poor dialogue american accents overuse of strong camera filters and a sequence order which appears to be 45 hours chopped into 25    even the amazing battle scene visuals were strangled by filters it was like watching through a vintage kaleidoscope
Nov 22 2023,negative,too long i wish they would have picked a part of his life to focus on it felt like a very surface level look at his life that chose odd sensationalized moments to hyper focus on like odd sex scenes treating josephine as nothing more than a slut the africa campaign and glazing over military campaigns joaquin phoenix had a hard time convincing me that he was napoleon nothing about his portrayal was likable napoleon was certainly a complicated man who does not deserve to be portrayed as some kind of a hero but he was certainly a person who inspired loyalty and is sometimes said to have been charismatic the movie did have beautiful costuming albeit a bit overtly sexual at times and cinematography
Nov 22 2023,positive,i liked the movie  well filmed and the acting was excellent of course the professional critics hated it for a very silly reason  it didnt go into enough detail  its a movie  not a novel  theres only so much time  given that constraint i found it very entertaining
Nov 22 2023,negative,we walked out enough said
Nov 22 2023,negative,theater is fab the movie  poor acting bad script that was so bad  it was humorous so disappointed
Nov 22 2023,negative,what a terrible film woefully miscast horrible pacing and fractured storytelling and a boring visual style
Nov 22 2023,positive,choppy the movie tries to cover too much a visual treat 
Nov 22 2023,positive,outstanding this is a movie to experience in the theater not at home joaquin phoenix takes the crown and definitely an oscar nomination vanessa kirby puts on a great performance in this film she deserves to be recognized this award season for her performance
Nov 22 2023,negative,very long movie with a weak story line hard to follow along and stay interested not worth the time
Nov 22 2023,negative,bad bad they did my boy napoleon so bad
Nov 22 2023,neutral,i really wanted to love this film  ive been anticipating it for quite a while  i came i watched i fled   vanessa kirby was one of the highlights  she brought a multidimensional josephine to life on the screen  i feel that the writers went terribly awry and mutilated the historical record  the battle scenes were epically  ahistorical especially waterloo so many missed chances for a good if not great film
Nov 22 2023,positive,liked the movie as a whole felt like they spent too much time on the relationship of napoleon and his wife
Nov 22 2023,positive,solid 3234  extended cut will probably make it substantially better enjoyable
Nov 22 2023,negative,this was less an epic biopic than a three hour youtube video with admittedly excellent cinematography sadly the beautiful imagery is where my compliments end    the story was more of a synopsis and an incomplete one at that lurching from bullet point to bullet point with a truckload of historical detail ignored in favor of an electron microscope zeroed in on napoleon and josephines dysfunctional marriage and not even that gets a thorough treatment we see their marriage and not 45 minutes later theyve suddenly been married 15 years if dialogue is to be believed    napoleons actual career gets only the most passing tangential coverage the rise to fame is reduced to a single battle with the entire italian campaign dispensed with by one line of dialogue    only three of his battles are even mentioned with one of the most significant getting a 30 second sequence and a title card the final battle we all know which one doesnt seem to pay any attention to history and gets several key details 101level things to anyone who knows their history blatantly wrong     i wont spoil anything but theres a particular story choice during the films climax that almost made me want to get up and leave the way the ending was done was also inexplicable    the pacing was an absolute mess possibly because the director insisted on incessantly cutting away from the historical story everyone came to see to haul the audience kicking and screaming back to the napoleons sad cringey domestic life its as though the filmmakers got a book about napoleon but only read the footnotes    in all the exclusion of major events and whole periods in favor of including tedious awkward and wannabe comedic minutiae made this film a slog a chore and frankly a big dmn disappointment     ridley scott has really badly whiffed it with this attempt this is unequivocally a miss
Nov 22 2023,negative,there is very little script here no development nor explanation of how napoleon was placed into power the love story is him staring at josephine then theyre married and its clear from the script that there is an assumption of the history of france but even though the movie is set in france about a man in france he speaks english like an american without a trace of a french accent oh and the rest of the french people have english accents so much for cinema verité  a real waste of a lot of money
Nov 22 2023,positive,an overwhelming experience in imax
Nov 22 2023,positive,amazing movie i really felt like i was in paris during the french revolution 
Nov 22 2023,positive,at times on the screen i forgot that joaquin phoenix was playing a character    the battles were exquisite and i was surprisingly alert throughout the long runtime the sets were so detailed and the score was funny at times and downright flooring at others    the battle of austerlitz will probably go down as my favorite scene of a 2023 movie
Nov 22 2023,negative,if one knows nothing about or doesnt care about history then one might find this entertaining i thought i might at least find the battle scenes enjoyable but no over simplistic borodino for example had a couple of minutes of screentime at waterloo la haye sainte and hougoumont no where to be seen napoleon charging into battle what one would think the entirety of the napoleonic wars was a random battle every few years fought with very little tactics or discipline  and what about our title character the director of this is the first to admit that this movie is a hit piece on napoleon and that it is so much so that you could call this a fantasy not historical movie the movie may look good to those who dont understand what they are watching but is that supposed to be enough is that how low we set the bar no historical movie is completely correct but those who made this travesty knew exactly what they were doing and for what to be provocative to mislead people into thinking this bares anything close to the truth how dishonest and arrogant
Nov 22 2023,neutral,very ambitious but disconnected and meandering  extremely disappointing use of talent and storytelling
Nov 22 2023,positive,i thought this film had a nice balance between narrative battles and bloodshed it wasnt joaquins best performance but he still did a solid job of executing his role in the right moments i feel like if he would have added a bit more creativity or creating a unique voice for napoleon it really would have elevated this performance where this movie truly shines is the incredible sets lighting and cinematography ridley scott did a nice job of creating as i said a balance between the narrative and when it would start to drag on a bit throw you in the midst of an epic battle that really grabs your attention there is plenty to enjoy with this film but it lacked a bit of spontaneity to really push it into masterpiece territory that being said it isnt a film for everyone but if you would enjoy a film with a bit of braveheart mixed with a tangled love story you will probably like this one
Nov 22 2023,positive,the battle scenes were epic joaquin did an incredible acting job portraying napoleon my favorite scene of the movie is when napoleon is chased out of the council joaquin can run with hat and costume in that beautiful french building enjoyed it a lot will watch again
Nov 22 2023,positive,i enjoyed the movie  the battle scenes and palace sets were tremendous  however i seriously doubt at least i hope that josephine was not as disrespectful as the movie portrays her to be  the movie also portrays napoleon as somewhat an intellectual dunce even though really he was a brilliant statistician  i could see the french being quite angered with napoleons wimpy presentation
Nov 22 2023,positive,a modern version of waterloo
Nov 22 2023,negative,it takes a story about one of the most successful human beings in western history and turns it into a strange messy tale of an average onedimensional cuckold the movie focuses mainly on his sad relationship with josephine ridley scott somehow avoids developing any story character development or even proper narration of history in the end it felt like a montage of random uncorrelated events that insults anyone with any historical curiosities of napoleon i left the theatre unfulfilled frustrated and somehow confused as to what had just happened im only giving it a full star instead of half of a star because of the cinematography and the beautiful battle scenes
Nov 22 2023,positive,i enjoyed joaquin phoenixs portrayal of napoleon the movie was well done and the three hours went by quickly it also stuck to the real history
Nov 22 2023,negative,trailer brings you to the theatre only to discover a notthatwell written movie more of a poorly executed parody than a drama what a shame considering the character that napoleon was the second star is for the battle on the ice good but too short
Nov 22 2023,positive,the movie was good but long
Nov 22 2023,positive,outstanding performance from both leads especially kirby and a story that keeps you engaged from start to finish with amazing battles set pieces and visuals loved it
Nov 22 2023,positive,very good movie i loved the action scenes and cool outfits
Nov 22 2023,negative,bad bad bad  i think was intended to be a tv miniseries that they turned into a boring movie first movie review hoping to save others the money i wasted on it
Nov 22 2023,positive,it was just ok  too much napoleanjosephine and not enough military genius napolean  over half the movie is about his personal life and only three battles in the rest  i was disappointed
Nov 22 2023,positive,exceptional another ridley scott spectaclesir ridley scott requires us to decide what napoleons real significance was as a man emperor and military strategist worth watching in a real theater
Nov 22 2023,neutral,napoleon is the greatest military general of all time but you never get that feeling with this movie i was disappointed that they went in the direction that they did
Nov 22 2023,negative,this movie is bad about two thirds of the movie is about him and josephine being weird and not the love that these two had for each other  napoleon is known for being a tyrant inspirational to his troops politically savvy strategically masterful and this movie shows none of this  if you know nothing of napoleon you may like it as shows some things about him but anyone that enjoys history or knows anything of this period of time will be gravely disappointed
Nov 22 2023,positive,an amazing movie for history buffs  phoenix does an amazing job portraying napoleons enormous ego as well as his passionate love for france and for josephine the movie is also a cautionary reminder that humans love a big personality that promises them the world it also reminds us that absolute power corrupts absolutely
Nov 22 2023,positive,great cinematic movie for those that love drama you will enjoy it for the rest the movie moved at a slow pace and in my opinion missed many important historical background in all fairness its probably quite hard to get his entire life into one film
Nov 22 2023,positive,overly long and boring
Nov 22 2023,positive,kept me entertained and interested one of the best movies of the year
Nov 22 2023,neutral,didnt get a catharsis
Nov 22 2023,positive,long and loud but decent i was honestly ready to leave but the ice scene was easily the best
Nov 22 2023,positive,another hapless flavorless late career entry from ridley scott
Nov 22 2023,neutral,in summary this movie was odd odd casting odd scenes and dialog odd camera angles and oddly chosen piano music from pride and prejudice phoenix is unconvincing as napoleon he just didnt exude a commanding presence i kept seeing the joker or a psychologically unstable caesar kirby came through with a strong performance little attention was given to anyone else for example general ney is in several scenes but goes unmentioned wanted to love this movie but its just bad no redeeming qualities skip napoleon and watch war and peace 1956 and waterloo 1970 i scratch my head at this odd film from a legendary director
Nov 22 2023,positive,weve waited for a good war movie this is it i dont watch it for the love story
Nov 22 2023,positive,i loved it but i am a fan of napoleon  joaquin phoenix
Nov 22 2023,negative,outside of a few battle scenes this was a jumbled mess wasting what should have been an epic will be another notable bomb
Nov 22 2023,positive,didnt want it to end could have kept watching it
Nov 22 2023,positive,napoleon takes you there
Nov 22 2023,negative,french history made for americans whats the point of making a historical biopic if almost everything in the film is fiction
Nov 22 2023,positive,this is one of those films thats an epic but doesnt quite know what to do with itself    this is an epic   were going to see oscar nominations for cinematography costumes and maybe even joaquin   as a practical movie it kind of doesnt know what it wants to be     you often see me ask what is this movie about    this movie is about the relationship between napolean and josephine   shot by a director who loves to shoot battle scenes   piecemeal some history in between and you get an epic thats a bit of a mess that leaves you wondering if an edit job would make this a bit better    you do see napolean change over time   at the first battle he demonstrates his skill and strategy driving the french to success   then over time you see that confidence turn into hubris as he becomes as person who thinks they cant do any wrong   the battle scenes are indeed amazing   but there is really no reason for them to be there aside from ridley wanting to direct something that awesome    they do a better job with the relationship  which is confusing in and of itself    napolean is head over heels for josephine but more as the best of best friends than he is at being a romantic lover    she loves him  kind of   but she swings between love and ambivalence    this relationship could have been the whole focus of the movie but we only see it in snippets  small enough were not sure if we should care or not   interleaf between all this are bits of french history  but not enough to let you know what is going on or why   honest they could have edited a lot of that out and focused more on the relationship it might have been a better movie      if you go i might do a quick wikipedia history of napolean to give yourself some good context   the what happens when part of history might leave you puzzled   and just sit back and enjoy the battles  some great filming there
Nov 22 2023,positive,what a incredible movie the choreography was unbelievable amazing props amazing cinematography just what a unbelievable movie truly
Nov 22 2023,positive,loved it joaquin phoenix was excellent as napoloeon
Nov 22 2023,positive,decent sequel but made no references to napoleon dynamite     i went into this film knowing it would feature new characters and a new plot but to completely ignore the first film is kind of a let down we assume he ended up with deb after the first film and in this one hes married to someone ive never even heard of     we never saw pedro again either but it has some cool fighting scenes honestly hollywood should making these sequels so many years later theyre either nothing but fan service or they dont even acknowledge the original
Nov 22 2023,negative,the first 34 of the movie was way to slow the only redeemable part was the battle of waterloo but it still was not coherent if you want to watch something that will make u appreciate a well paced war film watch 1917
Nov 22 2023,negative,this was a travesty from beginning to end riddled with inaccuracies blatantly false portrayals character assassination lazy cinematography and utter nonsense    the only explanation for how utterly horrible this film was is that ridley scott deliberately set out to make the worst napoleon movie he could because the english hadnt done enough to rub his name in the dirt already    the actors played well but their characters had little resemblance to their historical counterparts you cant even claim it was for the cinemas sake as ridley scott has evidently forgotten how to make quality films the pacing is jarring and nonsensical the script and screenplay are boring and contradictory and the cinematography is just lazy at austerlitz napoleon yells for the french infantry to take their the enemys positions on the high ground at which point a mob of frenchmen promptly charge down a large hillside and into a melee at waterloo you can even see where the fake rain stops on a puddle napoleon walks past side note napoleon shouldnt have even been on the field walking around as he had fallen ill the day of the battle    do not bother with this film it has no entertainment value and negative educational value
Nov 22 2023,neutral,overall a passable representation of one of historys most controversial figures  joaquin phoenix portrays napoleon as a whiny sniveling loser who pays a solid second fiddle to vanessa kirby whose josephine dominates throughout  she is the real story of this film  ive seen ridley scotts work before and yes its remarkable that at 85 years of age he still has the energy to direct a sprawling epic like this but this is not one of his better works  the choice of music at times was irritating and the film jumps around too much as it tries with not a whole lot of success to follow the chronology of the story so there are several gaps that leave you hanging  the battle scenes are adequategory and realistic but i was disappointed that scott gave rather short shrift to borodino the costliest battle in human history and blew off a great deal of waterloo and what was shown was not really all that good see the 1970 epic with rod steiger as napoleon and christopher plummer as wellington for a far more accurate and complete telling of the story of that battle  he concentrated mostly on austerlitz and i guess that with so much to cover there wasnt enough time to do adequate justice to the entire story  the film clocks in at just under three hours and does move along mostly ok but it drags in spots especially when showing the very strange relationship of josephine and napoleon i wouldve preferred more action in the field and less action in the bedroom which i found rather unnecessary and at times disgusting   it was good to see this film and i do recommend it with some reservations  i do not plan to see it again
Nov 22 2023,positive,great action and violence lots of production value and tells an enjoyable story
Nov 22 2023,positive,sometimes it moved forward in time seemingly suddenly or unexpectedly anyway until i came to expect it joaquins napoleon didnt seem like such a terrible guy but in the movie thats what they say he is also idk any history so knowing some stuff about france  europes history will enhance the experience of this film
Nov 22 2023,positive,napoleon 910  unexpectedly gory early on in some parts a lot of the film focused on napoleons relationship with his wife but that last battle sequence really got me into the war expect of film and some scenes before that with the army gave me goosebumps in a good way
Nov 22 2023,positive,ridley scott does it again what a film cannot wait for the 4 hour directors cut vanessa kirby steals the show highly recommend
Nov 22 2023,negative,gladiator was a great action film built on the mystique of rome circa 100 theres a lot of things the movie gets right about the times and myths and things scott does to build in theatrics that doesnt take away from the overall story you like love despise the characters the plot flows well as the story is weaved nicely   napoleon ef me there is so much material on the man and myth scott could have picked one thing and built a movie around it the movie is dull and slow the military scenes are fine but ef me man napoleon is arguably one of the greatest generals of all time and hes just this bland unmoving character that could have easily been played by a cardboard cutout of the man   the movie is all over the place his rise to power was swift but in the movie theres no explanation as to why why is he springboarding to emperor whats his motivation then you have the love interest which they try and build a chemistry that just isnt there kirby is not as bland as phoenix in her role but there is just not emotion phoenix is crying all the damn time youd think he would convey that he doesnt its forced its fake   so much time is devoted to napoleon and josephine fine make a movie about them but theres no real substance when you combine everything napoleon did and was into 25 hours and just gloss on every thing the man did   in the end scott highlights the troops he killed in his way up which wasnt the reason for his rise and fall and his love for josephine   last point napoleon was 51 when he died phoenix is 49 playing a man who started his military career at 18 and spanning until he was 46 when he became emperor for 3 months
Nov 22 2023,positive,it was entertaining with the love story between napoleon and josephine
Nov 22 2023,positive,ridley scott does it again what a film cannot wait to watch the 4 hour directors cut vanessa kirby stole the show 
Nov 22 2023,positive,actionpacked believable and good acting by all especially joaquin phoenix
Nov 22 2023,positive,well done flick  they make a great pair
Nov 22 2023,negative,should have called it josephine
Nov 22 2023,negative,to be fair i really dont think joaquin phoenix is the best actor in the first place i think this movie was about an hour longer than it should have been they director tried to tell the story of napoleon the mighty general and napoleon the lover of josephine in this attempt he didnt tell either story well
Nov 22 2023,positive,good history good acting and cinematography dont expect the characters to be bigger than life great battle   scenes not over done with blood and guts but enough  for realism if you like epics you will enjoy it
Nov 21 2023,positive,read the reviews seemed like it would be a good history flic disappointed    joaquin phoenix portrayal of napoleon was banal the audience is never given any insight into who napoleon really was as a man    vanessa kirby delivers a fine portrayal of josephine but there is little chemistry between her and phoenix and we are left wondering why josephine would be with napoleon    add to this the fragmented history that jumps in time and space with little explanation and the movie fails to hold ones attention    expected more from ridley scott
Nov 21 2023,positive,1010 entertainment impossible not to be entertained at the very minimum
Nov 21 2023,positive,competently shot and acted but the muddled plot and historical inconsistencies are too much
Nov 21 2023,negative,the scène didnt have link between them and they are boring 
Nov 21 2023,positive,apple and scott bring a wonderful story to the imax screen great battle scenes incredible betrayal between the two main lovers of this epic tale its more of a love story then an action movie the story moves slowly and is a bit choppy but overall the detail of the era is told in full
