"Mar 11, 2024",negative," Dice que, en esta vida, para todo hay una primera vez. Este 2023, en lo que respecta a mi relación con el séptimo arte en múltiples aspectos ha habido varias sorpresas inesperada, pero si debo destacar una por encima del resto esa es, sin duda, que Zack Snyder ha conseguido decepcionarme plenamente con uno de sus largometrajes desde que inició su filmografía en un ya lejano 2004 con 'Amanecer de los muertos'. Hasta la fecha, todas y cada una de sus películas —con sus evidentes e inevitables altibajos— habían conseguido encandilarme por diferentes motivos, incluyendo su incursión en la animación con una 'Ga'Hoole' merecedora de muchos más elogios de los que ha recibido. Desgraciadamente, estas navidades han traído bajo el brazo un regalo envenenado titulado 'Rebel Moon'. Desde su estreno el pasado 22 de diciembre han corrido ríos de tinta —o de ceros y unos, mejor dicho— en diferentes medios especializados y, por supuesto, en unas redes sociales en las que se sigue tratando a Snyder con un paternalismo rematadamente absurdo. El consenso general es que la 'Star Wars' particular del de Green Bay es un auténtico desastre; una opinión que, bajo mi punto de vista, lleva al extremo sus claras deficiencias. Pero, ¿qué convierte la ambiciosa producción de Netflix en el que, posiblemente, sea el último gran batacazo creativo del curso cinematográfico 2023? A pesar de que pueda dispararse en múltiples direcciones, tengo claro que el motivo no radica en su barroquismo digital, en las recargadas filias de Snyder como director o en esa presunta mente de adolescente a la que se aferran sus detractores para destriparle a golpe de tuit; sino en el elemento que sirve de motor a cualquier título: los personajes. No cabe duda de que 'Rebel Moon' tiene un buen puñado de frentes abiertos que la hacen no funcionar como debería pero, por encima de todo —y como suele ser habitual—, sus mayores problemas llegan de la mano de su narrativa. Una serie de inconsistencias que afectan severamente al conjunto y que, salvando las distancias, tienen puntos en común con lo ocurrido con el montaje cinematográfico de la 'Napoleón' de Ridley Scott. Puede que lo peor, y lo que más daña al filme en última instancia, sea su cadencia narrativa tremendamente apresurada y cargada de elipsis, probablemente concebida en la sala de montaje. A excepción de su primer acto, que sí se molesta en presentar la aldea de Kora y plantear el conflicto principal y el detonante con bastante acierto, el resto del metraje parece estar ensamblado pisando a fondo el acelerador y sin conceder un solo segundo de reposo. A esto, debemos sumar una estructura casi episódica propia de una serie de televisión que chirría especialmente dentro de un metraje de dos horas y cuarto. Los saltos entre localizaciones son constantes, las escenas se resuelven en unos pocos parpadeos y las entradas y salidas de personajes son, cuando menos, fugaces; lo cual hace que la historia pase sin pena ni gloria en pantalla, como si la causalidad se hubiese dejado a un lado y todo pase simplemente porque tiene que ocurrir. Todo ello deriva en la mayor lacra que puede tener cualquier tipo de producción: que los personajes no importen lo más mínimo. A excepción de Kora, que tiene algo más de desarrollo, no sabemos prácticamente nada del grupo protagonista, cuyos miembros son introducidos con unas cuantas líneas de diálogo que dan un mínimo de trasforndo, pero obviamente no el suficiente; sus dinámicas no están en absoluto trabajadas y terminan convirtiéndose en poco menos que en carne de cañón. Si no establecemos un vínculo con los héroes y sufrimos con su lucha por alcanzar sus objetivos, la emoción brilla por su ausencia, y sin emoción, no hay película defendible. Algo que se asevera con un tratamiento formal tremendamente plano —salvo honrosas excepciones marca de la casa y a pesar de la notable mano del director para planificar— y digno de cualquier serie impersonal enterrada en el catálogo de la plataforma, o con unos actores que parecen estar fuera de lugar. Tristemente, todo lo enumerado previamente podría haber sido perdonable de haber existido un mayor cuidado a la hora de moldear a los protagonistas y ubicarles como es debido en un universo que, sin duda, se percibe más rico de lo que se ha terminado mostrando en pantalla; demostrando una vez más que escribir, dirigir y montar debe hacerse única y exclusivamente con los personajes en mente. El resto, espectáculo visual incluido, no deja de ser algo secundario."
"Feb 29, 2024",neutral,"In the end, Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire is ridiculous, unoriginal, and stereotypical. But also? There is a lot of fun to be had, especially if someone can Jedi mindtrick you into forgetting you knew anything about Star Wars."
"Feb 2, 2024",negative," Happy February! We’re technically still in Winter in Minnesota, but you wouldn’t know it looking at the weather forecast. We’ve had a mild December and just a few frigid days in January, but it ended with a record-breaking temp. Per MPR, yesterday was the warmest Jan 31 in 150 years in the Twin Cities as temp topped out at 55 degrees on Wednesday afternoon. It broke the previous record of 46 degrees by 9 degrees, whoa! My hubby and I went out for a walk around a nearby lake in a light jacket, and the weird thing was I still saw a few people ice-fishing in the middle of the frozen lake! That’s Minnesotans for ya! I first heard of this film when news came out that Peter Sarsgaard won Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival last year. Somehow his name dropped off the radar come award season, which is a shame as his performance was terrific here. It’s a well-acted two-hander starring Sarsgaard and the always-watchable Jessica Chastain, Memory is a deeply layered and moving drama about past trauma and finding connection when you least expect it. It can be slow and tough to watch at times but well worth your time just for the lead performances alone. This was a really cute animated movie with Adam Sandler, Bill Burr, Cecily Strong (who’s so funny on SNL, I miss her!). The idea of a 74-year-old lizard named Leo and his turtle friend escaping their Florida school terrarium is quite a hoot. I was expecting a silly fish-out-of-water (well, a lizard-out-of-its-terrarium in this case) comedy, but LEO turns out to be quite a gem of a movie about unlikely friendships, loyalty, and aging gracefully, plus there are some life lessons delivered in a fun but endearing way. Oh, just so you know, this is an animated musical, but the songs are catchy and entertaining! I grew up loving cars thanks to my twin brothers, and my late brother used to play the Gran Turismo video game. What I didn’t realize was that this movie is based on a true story where gamers get to compete in real racing cars, thanks to crazy but ingenious ideas by a Nissan marketing exec (Orlando Bloom). I had just seen Archie Madekwe in Saltburn but he gets to flex his acting chops in a leading role here. The movie centers on two underdogs, Jann the gamer (Madekwe) and a failed former race driver Jack (David Harbour) working together to achieve the impossible. Overall I find it more enjoyable than Ferrari and the racing scenes, including the crashes, are well-staged, it uses CGI in an effective way to showcase the video game elements that enhance its storytelling. I was surprised that Neill Blomkamp directed this, I haven’t liked anything he’s done since District 9 in 2009. Mélanie Laurent directs and stars in this French action comedy… the tone is a bit off but manages to still be quite entertaining thanks to exhilarating high-octane action and the fun chemistry of the female cast, notably Adèle Exarchopoulos. An incredible true story of Australian teenager Jessica Watson, the youngest person ever to sail solo non-stop around the world. The subject matter is so fascinating that it deserves a much more compelling movie! Wish they gave the talented Cliff Curtis something worthy to do here. My goodness, where do I start?? I was curious to see if this is as bad as the critics say… well, as it turns out they’re spot on. This is the most inept, boring, pointless movie… not sure why people even compliment the visuals as it’s visually garish + ugly! Apparently, the project started out as Zack Snyder’s space opera concept pitch to Lucasfilm that got rejected. Well, Star Wars isn’t the only thing Snyder mined for inspiration, the 135-minute overlong slog is a chaotic compilation of so many better sci-fi fantasy franchises: Lord of the Rings, Avatar, Magnificent Seven, Kurosawa samurai epics, and so on. It’s such a waste of the talented cast, with Charlie Hunnam being the only bright spot (the one star is mostly for him) but wish he picked a better movie. This is by far the worst movie I saw of the entire month, probably of the year, too. I managed to finish two miniseries this month! Love both of them… I’ve written a review of BODIES, and will write about Lessons in Chemistry later this month. I highly recommend both of them, it’s time absolutely well-spent! Per Women In Film (WIF) organization, the basic rules of 52 Films By Women are simple: watch 52 films directed by women within one year and share what you watched on social media, using the hashtag #52FilmsByWomen to spread the word, and get more people talking about the women filmmakers that don’t always get attention. I’m starting the year strong with no less than seven movies #directedbywomen – woot! During the second week of January, I watched four female-directed movies back to back: Anatomy of a Fall, ORIGIN, Wingwomen, and True Spirit, then added the other 3: NYAD, Priscilla, and Silent Night in the last week of the month. I saw Poor Things much later than I would have liked but it was well worth the long wait!! It ends up making up my top 3 of the year, beating out Oppenheimer! It’s currently my favorite of Yorgos Lanthimos‘ work, though I have yet to see Killing of a Sacred Deer. Bravo to Emma Stone for her spectacular performance and for getting her first Oscar nom as a producer! For me, the film of the month is Babylon.  My only interest in Rebel Moon is to see Jena Malone as a spider as that is fucked-up combination of seeing the actress that I love being the thing I fear the most. I saw her name in the cast in IMDb so I kept looking for her. I didn’t realize it was her as the big spider… man she’s too good to be used in that way, but that movie wasted the talented cast! I do know what you mean though, it’s gotta be weird to see your fave actress playing the thing you fear most. I’m scared of spiders too! I still can’t believe how warm it’s been this winter here but I think we’ll get dump with a big snow storm and cold temps soon. I hope I’m wrong but this is MN. Lol! I got about halfway through Wingwomen then I turned it off. It started out well but the story didn’t go anywhere and I lost interest. Rebel Moon was one of the ugliest piece of crap movies I’ve ever seen. I don’t know how Snyder is still being employed by Netflix. His other movie, Army of the Dead, also looked like shit. The only “new” movie I saw last month was Cloud Atlas, a film that came out over a decade ago. I totally missed it when it first came out and realized that I have it on Blu-ray and decided to finally watch it. I thought it’s great but I do remember how divisive it was back in 2012. I watched mostly TV series. Finished the second season of Reacher and the latest season of Fargo. Yeah, Wingwomen is odd, but I kept on watching because I like the French actresses. It’s still waaaay better than Rebel Moon though, that is just the dumbest and ugliest thing I’ve seen in a long while. It ought to win ALL the Razzies!! I’ve been watching a lot of French action films on Netflix and looked forward to watching Wingwomen since the trailer looked it was going to be a fun action thriller. But once they arrived in that small town, the story just didn’t go anywhere and I got bored and turned it off. I think the Razzies might be even too good for Rebel Moon. I still can’t believe Snyder got millions of dollars from Netflix to make not just one but two Rebel Moon movies. I thought Cloud Atmas was the best film of the Wachowskis since The Matrix. They haven’t anything good since then. And yes, I remember reading your review of it over a decade ago. Lol! Yeah Melanie Laurent is so multitalented! It’s kinda a weird movie but still worth a watch for the cast! Ohhh yes, do see Poor Things, it’s worth seeing on the big screen! Film is in my blood. LOVE movies of all genres, from Jane Austen to James Bond. Official blogger for the Twin Cities Film Fest (TCFF). I’ve written and produced my first short film » HEARTS WANT in 2017 and currently working on developing the full story as a feature film."
"Feb 1, 2024",negative," While “Rebel Moon Part One: A Child of Fire” — hitting Netflix this week, after a limited theatrical run, and to be followed in April on the streaming service by “Rebel Moon Part Two: The Scargiver” —- also was influenced by “The Lord of the Rings,” “The Dirty Dozen” and more, it shares much with the 1977 film now titled “Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope.” There’s a malevolent galactic empire. Lightsaber-like swords. A scoundrel pilot. A polite robot. A bar scuffle. And, most importantly, a messiah figure pulled from an existence as a farmer. But while watching this first “Rebel Moon,” you can’t help but wonder if Snyder’s specific idea was to do “Star Wars” but without any of the fun. Snyder — whose credits include 2006’s “300,” several DC Extended Universe movies, including the much-discussed “Zack Snyder’s Justice League” in 2021, and “Army of the Dead” for Netflix later that year — has crafted a grandios but soulless tale that begins with some promise but wears you out over two-plus hours with the violent, slow-motion action sequences for which the director is so well known. In lieu of an opening crawl, Snyder gives us narration from the great Anthony Hopkins, who — in a movie boasting character names such as Titus, Nemesis and Devra Bloodaxe — goes by … Jimmy. We learn about a king, a princess and the Motherworld, which is using its military, the Imperium, to try to squash a growing resistance, a sort of rebel alliance, if you will. We then meet the good people of a village on the moon Veldt, who can produce a small surplus of food after harvesting grain for themselves and where a mysterious stranger named Kora (Sofia Boutella) has been taken in and helps farm the land. An Imperium warship arrives above the planet, and the villagers are visited by a force led by Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein), an officer giving off serious Nazi vibes and demanding they produce so much food for the military that they will not have enough left to feed themselves. Although she initially plans to flee Veldt, Kora quickly runs afoul of military men about to have their way with Sam (Charlotte Maggi), a sweet young woman. Soon, she and Gunnar (Michiel Huisman, “The Flight Attendant”), who oversees the harvest, leave to recruit others willing to help them fight the Imperium. The first recruit is Kai (Charlie Hunnam), a pilot and self-proclaimed “opportunist,” who takes them to other parts of the galaxy, where they pick up swordswoman Nemesis (Doona Bae, “Jupiter Ascending”); revolutionary Karian Bloodaxe (“Justice League” alum Ray Fisher), brother of Devra (Cleopatra Coleman, “Dopesick”); Bloodaxe footsoldeer Milius (E. Duffy); the once-regal Tarak (Staz Nair, “Supergirl”); and former military commander Titus (Djimon Hounsou, “A Quiet Place: Part II”). The building of this fellowship is the meat of this first “Rebel Moon,” and it is almost wholly uninteresting. It is joyless — an adventure that never feels remotely adventurous, despite little action pieces such as Nemesis’ fight with Harmada (Jena Malone), a half-woman, half-spider who has kidnapped a human girl. Reportedly, next year also will see an R-rated and extended cut of this film, said to be about an hour longer. It’s amazing that a movie that drags as much as “Child of Fire” can also feel rushed, at least in terms of its storytelling. As presently constructed, the movie’s narrative elements feel as though they’re being held together by fraying threads. Here’s hoping that added time will allow for at least SOME character development, as there is very little to be found in this version. There’s probably no saving the movie, but given the screen presence of Hunnam (“Triple Frontier,” “The Gentlemen”), Kai being fleshed out to the point of serving as even a poor man’s version of Han Solo would be something. (Do we even dare to dream Snyder could stitch together a bit of a love triangle for Kora, Kai and Gunnar? Probably best we don’t.) Boutella (2107’s “The Mummy” and “Atomic Blonde”) is pretty stiff in the lead role, but it’s also surely tough for any actor to shine in a Snyder movie, where all that stylized action — presented as slowly as possible — is the top priority. The best work is turned in by Skrein (“Midway”); even if Atticus isn’t likely to prove to be a memorable villain, he is sufficiently hateable all the same, especially in his tension-filled introduction. He works under the little-seen Regent Belisarius (Fra Fee, “Hawkeye”), who has a connection to Kora and who seems poised for a more significant part in “Scargiver.” That also would seem to be the case with Jimmy (Jimmy!), who’s mostly forgotten about after Kora’s altercation on Veldt. (If nothing else, Zack Snyder, please give us more Anthony Hopkins.) If there’s one area where Snyder succeeds with “Rebel Moon” is world-building. Sure, this universe has some things in common with a galaxy far, far away, but there are some inventive elements, such as one character you meet in the aforementioned cantina."
"Jan 31, 2024",negative," WHAT IT'S ABOUT Stop us if you've heard this before: In a galaxy far away from our own, a band of rebels gathers to fight back against militaristic oppressors, an empire bent on intergalactic conquest and subjugation. These rebels include a farmer, a smuggler trying to go straight, a former general and various warriors. They're led by a hero with deep ties to the evil regime. Oh, and there's a talking robot. If the world of Zack Snyder's “Rebel Moon” sounds an awful lot like a “Star Wars” castoff, that's not only because the “Justice League” filmmaker once pitched it to Lucasfilm. The finished product, set to be unveiled in two parts (the first of which, subtitled “Part One — A Child of Fire” is now on Netflix) as well as a director's cut, plays like the Bizarro World version of a “Star Wars” movie. The hero in question, named Kora (Sofia Boutella), has abandoned her life as a highly trained soldier and the adopted daughter of the evil senator Balisarius (Fra Fee), who now lords over the movie's version of the Empire, called the Motherworld. Kora has traded it all for life in a simple farming community. But her idyll gets shattered when Balisarius' right-hand man, the sadistic Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein), lands there, kills the community's leader (Corey Stoll) and threatens the rest with a violent return unless they compensate him with most of their grain. So an interplanetary recruitment trip must begin, with Kora joined by the farmer Gunnar (Michael Huisman) on a search for the right collection of resistance fighters. Cast members also include Djimon Hounsou, Charlie Hunnam and Anthony Hopkins, who gives voice to the aforementioned robot. MY SAY There's nothing fundamentally wrong with pursuing a “Star Wars”-adjacent project. So much of modern sci-fi today still remains shaped and inspired by that universe. But even as Snyder attempts to construct a world of his own in “Rebel Moon,” it's so similar that it becomes hard to take seriously on its own terms. Throw in some of the classic Western genre tropes that also inspired George Lucas and are about as old as the movies themselves, and you're left longing for any number of dozens upon dozens of better options. Were one able to get past all that, there's still the endless exposition to contend with and dialogue that consists in large part of endless droning monologues that have a knack for sapping out any semblance of suspense or tension. Throw in a good measure of slow-motion action, the same stuff Snyder has been known for since he directed “300,” which came out in 2007. Add to it a general aura in which everything feels impossibly overdone, with some of the creatures of this universe crossing the line from creative and cool to downright unsettling, and you wind up with a picture that feels more like a bad episode of cosplaying than a compelling new vision."
"Jan 26, 2024",negative,In the running for the worst movie of 2023.
"Jan 17, 2024",positive," Individuals can make a difference against an oppressive or authoritarian system or colonizer. You can't negotiate with bad actors. Not everyone can be trusted. Don't judge a book by its cover. A village of farmers works collectively for the common good. Some characters put themselves in harm's way for the benefit of others, even to the point of sacrificing their own lives. There's much discussion of honor and what it means to act honorably. Characters have suffered the trauma of extreme violence and loss, which they either run from or try to face and overcome. Others seem to want to redeem themselves from their actions in the past. The film is set on a string of planets with a diversity of human and human-like species as well as a variety of creatures and robots. The lead cast is also diverse, with actors hailing from Algeria, Holland, Scotland, England, Ireland, Benin, Korea, Australia, Iceland, and more. English is the main language spoken, in a variety of accents. Graphic fight scenes involve on-screen deaths, including by sword, knife, falls, guns, explosions, broken bones, and more. People are killed in front of those who love them. Men threaten sexual violence toward a young woman. Creepy creatures appear to suck life out of or give life to humans; another half woman/half spider tries to avenge the destruction of her planet. Kids are put in peril through kidnappings, invasions, and battles. Adults recall the destruction around them as children, including the murders of their families. A man is shackled. A soldier appears to enjoy being cruel and killing. Teeth fly out of a man hit in the head. Technology is used to bring someone back to life and it's mentioned that a brain will be dissected. A village leader calls for his people to go home and ""make love"" to celebrate with the ""thrusting of hips."" A person makes reference to the sounds of lovemaking. A man wants to pay to have sex with another man, and he grabs his groin, telling him he'll be left begging for more. There is kissing and the suggestion of crushes and settling down. Characters drink ale and other concoctions at celebrations and a bar. A man connects his body to an infusion-looking machine that appears to give him a drug-like pleasure. Parents need to know that Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire is a sci-fi fantasy epic from director Zack Snyder featuring an international cast and graphic violence. There is also some swearing, including ""s--t,"" ""hell,"" ""a--hole,"" ""bitch,"" and more. Fight scenes involve on-screen deaths, sometimes of beloved characters in front of their loved ones, including by sword, knife, falls, guns, explosions, broken bones, and more. Men threaten sexual violence toward a young woman. Creepy creatures appear to suck life out of or give life to humans, and kids are put in peril through kidnappings, invasions, and battles.

After an insurrection leaves the benevolent royal family of the Motherworld dead, no corner of the universe is safe in REBEL MOON: PART ONE – A CHILD OF FIRE. That includes the residents of the peaceful farming village of Veldt, where Kora (Sofia Boutella) hides her warrior past. When the cruel commander Noble (Ed Skrein) and a fleet of soldiers land in Veldt and make impossible demands, Kora opts to run -- again -- rather than stay and fight. A single incident forces her to change her mind, so she and fellow villager Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) set off across planets to round up a band of rebels to try to save Veldt. They include gun-for-hire Kai (Charlie Hunnam), General Titus (Djimon Hounsou), swordswoman Nemesis (Doona Bae), Prince Tarak (Staz Nair), and resistance fighters Darrius Bloodaxe (Ray Fisher) and Milius (E. Duffy). The first of two planned entries in a new franchise for Netflix makes for an accomplished visual spectacle, but the characters and scenarios are more predictable than likely intended. Much about Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire feels pulled directly out of the Star Wars universe. Technical innovations have improved the way new worlds can be brought to life in sci-fi and fantasy forays, and Rebel Moon packs some impressive sequences, costuming, effects, and general visual experiences. The problem comes more from the feeling that for all its technical prowess, the story lacks soul. You've seen it all before. Of course, the reality of franchise-driven Hollywood is that many audiences desire familiarity and predictability. Rather than the more mythical journeys of its obvious inspirations, like the Skywalkers or Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, Rebel Moon pulls its otherworldly characters down to our level and motivates them by basic human interests like childhood traumas, absentee families, and sexual desire. This certainly makes them easy to understand, but it also feels a little humdrum and less epic than the invented worlds and mega-production suggest. There's something very outdated as well in video game-inspired fight scenes and especially the macho posturing of soldiers, including attempted sexual aggressions. Families can talk about how Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire sets up a cast of characters and a story that can be carried on into future films. What do you expect to happen next in this story? What aspects of Veldt and other locations felt like Earth, and which didn't? What technical handiwork goes into creating new worlds and planets, like in Rebel Moon? How would you describe main character Kora's motivations? What about the other warriors she picks up along the way? Why do they all agree to help defend the village of Veldt?

"Jan 16, 2024",negative,"Despite the expected dazzling sequences from a visualist like Snyder, the subpar story and pace end up taking us to the dark side of boredom. Hopefully, the extended version and its sequel will eclipse these shortcomings.

"Jan 12, 2024",neutral,"Part One fails to captivate the through its admittedly impressive visuals, as the story feels like recycled ideas that never quite come together. There is plenty of potential here, but it can’t overcome a lackluster script."
"Jan 11, 2024",negative," There’s no joy to be found in hating a director’s entire body of work. On a long enough timeline and with strong enough scripts, any director can find their niche and produce a good film or two. This hope prevails in the hearts of optimists who, having seen glimmers of gold within the shit-mine that is Zack Snyder’s oeuvre, find themselves hoping that one day, he’ll make something truly excellent, even if it’s terribly dumb and full of gratuitous slow-motion. Largely shackled by comic book adaptations and franchises for the better part of the last 20 years (besides 2011’s Sucker Punch and 2021’s Army of the Dead and Army of Thieves, of course), the idea of Snyder doing his version of Star Wars felt promising. Perhaps, with just a little bit of grace, the much-maligned filmmaker could at last take all his stylistic quirks and urges and create a universe befitting the fawning adoration granted to him by internet movie bros. It’s cynical to say that “It’s the hope that kills you,” but in the case of Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire, it’s just too fitting. All films reveal something about their maker, and in the case of Rebel Moon, it reveals that the issue was never that Snyder was being held back by having to adapt the work of others. The reality is that the best parts of 300, Watchmen, and Dawn of the Dead only exist because Snyder was being kept on a leash. His disciples will argue that the comparative qualities of each so-called “Snyder Cut” of any of his films show a history of executive meddling ruining his vision, but really, his director’s cuts only serve to make lackluster films more Snyder-flavored, without making them good.  If you’ve seen Star Wars, Seven Samurai and A Bug’s Life, you don’t need to watch Rebel Moon. Snyder has been upfront about these inspirations in interviews, but despite the overwhelming obviousness of their influence, it’s hard to say whether Snyder or his co-writers (Kurt Johnstad and Shay Hatten, whom he worked with on 300 and Army of the Dead and their sequels, respectively), understood what made those films work. We watch soldiers of an authoritarian empire land on the backwater moon of Veldt and do some textbook-evil stuff (beat an old man to death, try to rape a young woman, abuse their own robot helper, demand the farmers of Veldt give up all their crops), but their actions are too on-the-nose to be menacing. We watch our heroes, Kora (Sofia Boutella of The Mummy (2017) fame) and Gunnar (Michiel Huisman, better known as Daario Naharis on Game of Thrones) slowly collect other rebels, but none of them are compelling enough for us to even remember their names or anything about them once the film changes focus to another planet and another rebel. This is the epitome of “tell, don’t show” sci-fi, where every character speaks in chunks of wooden exposition, every person and place thoroughly explained at other people, even if those people would already know everything being said. In one particularly egregious late-film scene, the villain of the film (and likely the series) rattles off facts about Kora to her face. This kind of thing happens repeatedly throughout the movie, making almost every interaction feel like a tedious slog. This is one of the easiest pitfalls of the space epic: You end up needing characters to deliver a lot of dialogue meant for the audience, not for the people in the film.  Essentially nothing about Rebel Moon works — even when the film stumbles onto something bordering on interesting character or environmental design, it’s undercut by just looking lifeless and sterile, even in natural settings. The one thing that Snyder should be able to do in his sleep — give us cool-looking fight sequences — instead feels like a joke played on the audience, a murky barrage of slow-mo and bland, toothless violence. Watching some comically evil Space Nazis get their brains blown out by a robot voiced by Anthony Hopkins won’t change the fact that the Snyder we find on Rebel Moon couldn’t frame a shot to save his life, which is a death sentence for action scenes, and spells doom for smaller moments that happen outside our view for seemingly no reason. As the first installment of an (at least) two-part story, Rebel Moon feels like it devoted all its energy in setting up part two (The Scargiver, due out in April), but totally forgot that, typically, movies only get a sequel when enough people like the first film. Snyder’s clout and name recognition is enough that Part Two was essentially a foregone conclusion, and it’s clear that Snyder and his co-writers thought to themselves, “It’s fine! Part Two will be where all the really good stuff happens, once we know who everyone is!” The end result is a half-assed, half-baked, half-finished schlockfest that leaves you struggling to imagine anybody — even the most die-hard Snyder apologists — finding enough value in it to want to give away another two-plus hours of their precious lives to its sequel.  Early Water doesn’t have much of an arc — after all, it’s a rehearsal tape. But it does have a surprisingly plentiful array of textures and transitions within its somewhat narrow parameters. "
"Jan 10, 2024",negative,"Rebel Moon has potential, but borrows too many elements from the films it’s inspired by. Zack Snyder fans must once again wait for a future cut to fulfill the director’s true vision."
"Jan 9, 2024",negative," While Zach Snyder’s (Army of the Dead, Watchmen, Dawn of the Dead) relationship with Warner Bros. officially ended with the release of Zack Snyder’s Justice League (i.e. the 2021 Snyder Cut), a certain subset of extremely online diehard fans have refused to let sleeping and/or comatose superheroes lie. With dimming fervour, the same fans have unrealistically pushed for Snyder’s return to a corporate-branded superhero franchise, refusing to take reality for an answer. Not coincidentally, Snyder’s incredibly ambitious franchise starter/wannabe, Rebel Moon — Part One: A Child of Fire, will be released on streaming giant Netflix the same weekend as the final entry in the DCEU (DC Extended Universe), Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, arrives in movie theatres. Ambition is the key word here as Snyder, one of the premier visual stylists of the twenty-first century but also one of the least subtle, envisioned not just a world but a standalone universe of its own. One that would generate all manner of related properties, from spinoffs to direct sequels, a prequel here or there, and possibly even a series set somewhere within the boundaries of Snyder’s future-set space opera. Netflix seems to think so, too, since they’ve invested untold sums to allow Snyder to fulfill his vision. Though it’s certainly questionable whether they should have or—at a minimum—demanded more rigorous attention to screenplay quality and/or a more streamlined editing process aimed at coherent, compelling storytelling rather than what we ended up with here (i.e. the exact opposite). Much of that may be a direct result of Snyder and Netflix’s decision to release Rebel Moon as a two-part film (Part Two: The Scargiver is due next spring) but also as separate Snyder cuts for both halves, each one longer than the original by at least an hour. That length is presumably there to deepen character development, add missing exposition, and include Snyder’s favourite stylistic flavours (e.g. slow motion/speed ramping, etc.) and thematic preoccupations like the conflict between libertarian-leaning personal morality and authoritarian political structures, the responsibilities and duties of superheroic and ordinarily heroic characters thereof. That fight or flight response fuels Rebel Moon: Part One — The Child of Fire and its central character, Kora (Sofia Boutella), an ex-Imperium officer turned dirt farmer on the “rebel moon” of the title, Veidt. Saved from a mysterious crash two years earlier, Kora’s life took a turn for the better when she was welcomed by a romanticized, idealized pre-industrial, agrarian community. She has everything she could need, from a physically demanding, if otherwise fulfilling, life. She even has an occasional bedmate to satisfy her other physical needs. For Kora, it’s the first real home she’s had, the first home outside of the brutal, world-conquering military machine led by her surrogate father, Regent Balisarius (Fra Fee), a likely usurper to the centuries-old monarchy abruptly ended by an unseen assassin. As dictatorial, however, as Balisarius might be, he’s only slightly worse than the Roman-inspired monarchs he replaced. Each ruled through the force of arms and the threat of violence, using both to win (and lose) worlds across the galaxy. Kora’s brief peace doesn’t last long. When a fascist in a black tie, black suit, and a severe haircut appears one afternoon, newly disembarked from the Imperium Dreadnought circling overhead like a shark that hasn’t fed in weeks, it’s easy to surmise what HR reps the world over like to call “next steps:” The Imperium wants the grain from the next harvest in the 9-10 weeks, to murder a high-ranking member for the community in cold blood publicly, and leave a small contingent of ill-mannered, unprofessional soldiers to monitor the community’s progress over the next three months. The Imperium’s plans don’t remain in place for long, leaving Kora as the de facto leader and resistance organizer. In rapid, linear succession, Kora and her second-in-command, Gunnar (Michiel Huisman), acquire the help or the promise of help from Kai (Charlie Hunnam), a black market smuggler, Tarak (Staz Nair), an ex-nobleman turned blacksmith’s assistance, Nemesis (Bae Doona), a double-sword carrying mercenary, Titus (Djimon Hounsou), a disgraced general turned gladiator, Darrian Bloodaxe (Ray Fisher), the co-leader with his sister, Devra Bloodaxe (Cleopatra Coleman), of a resistance group large enough to get the Imperium’s attention. At various times, characters spontaneously bring up the words “rebellion,” “revolution,” and “insurgency” as if they’re interchangeable terms. They’re not. Far from it, but the mixed-use suggests more than muddled dialogue. It suggests muddled, unfocused storytelling by either a confused, bored, or even indifferent screenwriter or screenwriting team. Either that or somewhere in the cut, soon-to-be restored footage for the director’s cut, several characters sit down for a political discussion and iron out what they mean when they use those words in any relevant or possible context. Not surprisingly for an unoriginal, derivative work like Rebel Moon — Part One: A Child of Fire that takes inspiration or — less charitably — borrows freely without attribution, from highly popular, well-known 20th-century works of commercial art like Flash Gordon, the Foundation trilogy, Dune, and Star Wars (itself a product of many influences), before borrowing the premise wholesale from Akira Kurosawa’s Seven Samurai. (Roger Corman got here decades ago, releasing Battle Beyond the Stars four years after Star Wars broke box-office records around the world). In moderation, influences, callbacks/shout-outs, and fan service are fine, maybe even more than fine, but when those influences are always surface-deep and constantly call attention to themselves via narrative echoes, it’s a surefire way to ensure your audience is more engaged in spotting references and patting themselves on the back than caring about the sketchily developed characters onscreen or their individual and collective fates. And at least in this truncated iteration of Snyder’s latest franchise wannabe/starter, we don’t. All You Need Is Death is the latest in the Celtic folk horror genre that will appeal to fans of You Are Not My Mother, A Hole in the Ground and Men.

"Jan 7, 2024",negative," One of the best things I can say about director Zack Snyder‘s sci-fi space epic “Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire” is that at least it’s not totally unwatchable. It certainly is a total mess of a movie (which was supposedly inspired by “Star Wars,” Akira Kurosawa, and “Heavy Metal” magazine) that’s unfocused and lacking in all areas, from lame CGI effects and one-dimensional characters to mediocre performances and unsatisfying plot. Despite all of these serious flaws, I couldn’t stop watching. It’s not that I’m a total glutton for punishment, but that I inexplicably found myself invested in the lead character’s story arc. Set on the quiet edges of the galaxy, the hardworking inhabitants a peaceful farming colony are threatened by the tyrannical ruling force. Kora (Sofia Boutella) is a tough, mysterious stranger who lives among the villagers. Desperate for help, Kora is tasked with assembling a team of trained fighters and brave warriors to help make a stand against the Mother World. She searches for the best people she can find, which includes an unlikely group of outsiders that share a passion for revenge. The story takes a long time to get going and once it does, it’s a letdown. There’s a lot of traveling around the galaxy and meeting new characters that simply aren’t all that interesting. The only one with whom I developed any sort of emotional connection is Kora, with the others fading into the background. At least Snyder nails the villain department, as Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein) embodies pure evil (which makes him a great bad guy). The film doesn’t look great either, with horribly mediocre CGI effects and bloodless, censored PG-13 action. Snyder pushes the boundaries of the rating with violence, but there’s no grisly aftermath. It’s not that the movie needs it to be enjoyable, but it does make it feel too sanitized. Dragging this story out into two parts is excessive, but hopefully the second installment will fare better. “Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire” is a drab, unexciting movie that’s only slightly better in quality than a “Star Wars” mockbuster."
"Jan 7, 2024",neutral," For almost two decades, the director has stood at the fore of Hollywood barricades, enduring the slings and arrows of critics, toxic fans, journalists, personal tragedies, corporate suits and more. Through it all, the man had continued to make movies his way without the pandering increasingly common to directors of cinematic blockbusters. In other words, he is who he is, says what he wants to say, and doesn’t care what anybody thinks. His latest endeavor, Rebel Moon: A Child of Fire (Part One), finds Snyder relishing his love of science fiction and anime. As an original story, the pressures and expectations of executives and fans that so plagued his superhero outings do not encumber the arrival of the movie. On the other hand, some of Snyder displays some of his bad habits here, and the resulting film never quite makes the jump to lightspeed. In a distant galaxy, the Imperium, a militaristic dictatorship, rules over countless worlds with brutality and oppression. On the tiny farming moon of Veidt, Korra (Sofia Boutella), a former Imperium soldier, now lives a quiet life planting fields with her fellow villagers. When Imperium forces led by the nefarious Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein) try to take control of Veidt, Korra and her friend Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) set out on a planet-hopping mission to recruit mercenaries and anti-Imperium rebels in hopes of building a force to resist fascist aggression. Reading that summary, anyone with even a passing knowledge of American movies probably has a looming thought on their mind: Rebel Moon sounds a lot like Star Wars. Indeed, though Snyder has worked on the Rebel Moon story on and off for almost 40 years, he did pitch the concept to Lucasfilm as a possible Star Wars spin-off movie. The project has obvious parallels to the galaxy long ago and far, far away, and much as George Lucas did in 1977, Snyder and his co-writers, Kurt Johnstad and Shay Hatten, construct Rebel Moon as a pastiche of beloved genre fare. The Seven Samurai, The Wizard of Oz, Space Battleship Yamato, Lord of the Rings, Alien, Blade Runner, the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Attack on Titan all get references here. Yet if Snyder wants Rebel Moon to have the same new-yet-familiar glow as Star Wars, he forgot to add the one key ingredient: beloved characters. Though Boutella has the right amount of grit, mystique, and cunning to make a great protagonist, and though the camera loves her angular face, Korra lacks the irrepressible personality that allows her to transcend her archetypal origins. Korra’s empathy and mysterious past will keep viewers rooting for her but won’t make an audience care about her. Other characters, including the enslaved prince Tarak (Staz Nair), the pilot Kai (Charlie Hunnam), the warriors Darrian and Devra (Ray Fisher and Cleopatra Coleman), and the evil Noble, get even less depth. They never feel like real characters, so much as placeholders in a story outline. Child of Fire lacks the kind of goofy humor or character banter that makes the characters in Star Wars or Star Trek so beloved. The biggest laugh here comes in the opening shot, as a phallic spaceship traverses a giant, pink opening in spacetime. Freud would have howled in the cinema. Two performers defy their restrictions: Doona Bae as the swordmaster Nemesis and Djimon Hounsou as Titus, an alcoholic general. Bae and Hounsou have the kind of magnetic charisma and personalities that make their characters vivid, even though both have little screen time or dialogue. Indeed, one of Child of Fire’s best sequences introduces Nemesis as she fights a child-eating spider woman (Jenna Malone). In their brief moments together, Child of Fire sparks with the kind of character drama that the rest of the movie lacks and hints at what might be the movie’s biggest problem. Snyder and Netflix have already announced that an R-rated, much longer version of Child of Fire will debut early in 2024 on the streaming service. Snyder, of course, loves releasing extended cuts of his films, as he did with Watchmen, Sucker Punch, and most notoriously, Justice League and Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice. Critics maligned the latter when it arrived in theatres in one of the worst critical drubbings in recent memory. Yet, when Snyder released his “Ultimate Cut,” which reinserted 30 minutes of deleted scenes, a totally different, much more intriguing movie emerged. The longer version of Batman v. Superman has undergone something of a reevaluation since debuting its longer cut, earning accolades as a secret success. A Child of Fire seems to have the same problem. The second half of the movie jumps from one action sequence to another in rapid succession, adding characters along the way as it does. We suspect that the longer cut of the movie will reinsert considerable character drama and exploration, which can only help the story. The director should remember that no amount of slick visuals and action will engage an audience beyond the superficial if viewers don’t care about the characters. And A Child of Fire has plenty of visual flare. The aesthetic of the movie looks like an anime come to life, and several action sequences—including one of a space ship crashing into a station—have the edge-of-your-seat kind of suspense that makes an audience hold its collective breath. Or they would, if viewers cared more about the drama. Snyder has also developed a rich backstory to his universe, and scenes of aliens suckling at human hosts, androgynous soldiers marching to battle and space griffins soaring over extraterrestrial worlds have enough imagination to enthrall an audience. A Child of Fire is, in short, not as irredeemable as some of our fellow critics have insisted. Snyder again reminds viewers of his immense talent, even if the movie feels incomplete. Given that sequels, a TV series, and a continuation titled The Scaregiver (debuting in April) all follow the longer cut of A Child of Fire down the pipeline, it seems Snyder intends to flesh out his universe, and has much more to say about the world he has engineered. Here’s hoping next time he can use a complete sentence. Until then, audiences wanting a space opera with more than just visual splendor will need to wait for the extended edition.

"Jan 5, 2024",negative," For those who are sad about the sun setting on the DC era of the Snyder-verse, please do not fret, for those miss slow-motion battle scenes, unnecessary lens flares, and dark gritty unsympathetic characters who seem pissed off about saving mankind, Zach Snyder has brought forth his vision of the future with the science fiction saga Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire for all to enjoy. Depending on your definition of “enjoy.” At least, that was the intention. But it is doubtful that many will enjoy this wannabe Star Wars for much of anything other than one-star zingers on Letterboxd.  Conceived by Snyder decade ago, the original space saga is the story of Kora (Sofia Boutella), a former soldier-turned-member of a peaceful farming community on the planet Veldt whose livelihood is threatened by the tyrannical Imperium, led by Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein), who rule the Motherworld. To protect her people, she goes on a quest to gather warriors from different corners of the galaxy, with hopes of overthrowing the repressive regime.  This is an oversimplification of a perplexing, problematic story so jam-packed with mythos, exposition, and flashbacks that the central figures are given practically no time to develop into meaningful characters.  Rebel Moon is an aggressively mediocre space opera that is less of a coherent plot and more of an amalgamation of vignettes in which a grumpy galactic gunslinger gathers space hobos for her battle against celestial Nazis. With plot points seemingly cobbled together from Seven Samurai, The Dirty Dozen, Dune, and The Unforgiven, as well as a dozen or so other pop culture properties to come out in the last 50 years, Rebel Moon has little to offer in terms of originality. According to interviews, Snyder once had hopes for Rebel Moon to have a place in the Star Wars universe (at one point, a character makes use of non-Disney branded Lightsabers), but it omits the tenacity and thrills that the original trilogy is known and adored for.  Synder’s space opus not only lacks heart and humor, but it falls short on the fundamentals necessary for moviegoers to want to join a hero’s journey. In Star Wars, viewers watch Luke evolve from lonely farm boy into a protagonist. During that journey, they can see themselves in Luke as he transitions from chump to champ. In Rebel Moon, none of that growth exists on screen. The audience doesn’t experience the odyssey; they are just told about it in derivative flashbacks using half-baked characters who are just mildly amusing, at best.  Rebel Moon, overusing the trope to the point of parodying himself.  Rebel Moon combines complicated world building with shoddy characters and substandard storytelling to create a lackluster narrative. The shortage of humor, heart, and humanity lessens the basic necessities required to create a compelling narrative, resulting in an uninspired sci-fi tale. Somewhere in there might have been a riveting epic for the ages, but that story is buried deep in intergalactic nonsense where aspects of fun and joy are far, far away."
"Jan 4, 2024",negative," Subtlety, nuance and detail are absent from Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire, which is a shame, given that the film’s striking trailer gave us new hope for a science fiction franchise that could rival its obvious biggest influence, Star Wars. The first chapter of the two-part film, now available on Netflix, is entertaining enough given the nonsensical plot, chaotic pacing, flat characters and cliched dialogue. The story begins in a small farming village on an independent moon called Veldt. This is, of course, set in a distant galaxy ruled by a militaristic empire named Motherworld, whose royal family was recently assassinated in an attempted coup. The now reigning forces continue to rule the universe through violent conquests and war. Kora (Sofia Boutella) is one of the farmers on Veldt, with a mysterious past who has found a sense of purpose while living and working off the land. “I’m a child of war. To truly love and be loved … I don’t know if I’m capable of either,” Kora says in one of the first scenes of the film. In this early sequence, the audience is presented with the main emotional thread of the story: The real struggle Kora has to face is herself. When life in the village takes a dramatic turn, Kora’s existential journey begins. This could have been presented in a more compelling way than through expositional dialogue, which is present in almost every scene of the film, exhaustively explaining everything that's happening to the audience instead of leaving room for them to derive meaning through the story itself. Alas. Admiral Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein), a brutal military leader from Motherworld, arrives to Veldt, with his loyal troops in tow. Noble demands and threatens the village to sell him their grain, even if it means not having enough to feed themselves. In retaliation, Kora sets off through the galaxy with a farmer named Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) to gather a band of soldiers who will fight to bring down Noble and his army. Meanwhile, Noble and his military legion are aboard a colossal space vessel named The King’s Gaze, a frightening force that has wiped out whole planets and races. One must ask, why would their leader’s focus be on grain from a small, random village? This should come as no surprise given Snyder’s body of work, which includes 300, Watchmen and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. He is a director who prioritises contrasting colour and dramatic lighting to create mood while producing grand, theatrical compositions reminiscent of comics and graphic novels to captivate his audience. While sometimes a little too stylised, the cinematography, special effects and choreographed fight scenes are visually engaging, and do a lot of the world building on their own, particularly giving hints of the galaxy's history and mythology. This is exactly what we want to see in a space opera – epic scenes in outer space, where advanced technology, warfare and interstellar battles are melodramatic and all-consuming. These elements are well executed, but they need to make sense. Action needs to be anchored, otherwise it's just movement. There are many points at which it seems Snyder has attempted to do so, but he fails at every turn. In one sequence, Kora and Gunnar travel from one planet to the next to collect their band of outsiders, and she narrates her own history with the Motherworld and her connection to its current leader, Balisarius. These flashbacks, while visually appealing, are woven into the story in a manner that feels a little blunt and amateur. Information is added, but nothing is gained, a mistake Synder and his co-writers, Shay Hatten (John Wick: Chapter 3 and 4), Kurt Johnstad (Atomic Blond and 300), keep repeating throughout the film. Together, this creative team has crafted a set of characters who are interesting only on the surface. The details of how they look, act and dress is part of a larger world that does make one curious to learn more. But as soon as these characters open their mouths, there is nothing there but jargon and hackneyed one-liners. Things do, thankfully, pick up towards the end, which bodes well for the sequel heading to the platform in spring. There's a powerful plot twist towards the end, which ups the stakes of what the characters are fighting for. This was done, frustratingly enough, without telling us much about the characters themselves, making it hard to grab hold of. It’s natural to be inspired by other films or literature. The problem is how you use them. In this case, Synder never manages to take the elements that he admired from other films and mould them to fit his own aesthetic, and by extension, create a solid and distinct world. Instead, the stories and images that shaped him only serve to make his own world look undeveloped in comparison. Over and over again, the film presents many missed opportunities for audiences to engage on an emotional level with the characters' respective journeys, delivering instead all the basic assumptions of an “epic” space opera. Perhaps it’s a formula that works for many, since the film currently sits at number one on Netflix’s top 10 movie list in the UAE. But it takes more than beautiful images and expert fight choreography for a film to collate a massive fandom and become a long-lasting cultural staple, which this film is clearly intended for. And this is the film’s ultimate issue. In its desperation for epic moments, Rebel Moon forgets about the intimate ones, instead delivering microwave popcorn entertainment without much to feel, connect with or remember."
"Jan 4, 2024",positive," **** The trailers for American Fiction have been selling the feature as Bamboozled in the publishing industry, and while that’s certainly the crux of the story, it doesn’t get to the root of what makes the film compelling. Based on the novel Erasure by Percival Everett, the movie follows Thelonious “Monk” Ellison (Jeffrey Wright), a novelist pigeonholed into the African American studies genre. Looking to break out, Monk turns in an aggressively Black tale of criminality, drug addiction and absent fathers, which becomes a sensational hit despite his attempts at sabotage. Writer-director Cord Jefferson makes the most of the satirical premise, and there’s definitely some laughs to be had at the expense of would-be progressives who fetishize stories of Black suffering. However, the real meat of American Fiction is Monk’s personal relationships, particularly with his ailing mother (Leslie Uggams), self-destructing brother (Sterling K. Brown), and newfound paramour (Erika Alexander). It’s here that we understand the root of Monk’s issues and why he strives to set himself apart from what filmmaker Radha Blank once called “poverty porn.” All the actors shine, but Wright’s comedic chops and genuine heart hold the whole thing  together. He’s been a reliable character actor for years now, and seeing his long-overdue star turn is hugely gratifying. American Fiction may make some audiences uncomfortable, but its razor-sharp satire and engaging family drama make  it both a must-watch and a serious awards contender. R. MORGAN SHAUNETTE.

Set in present-day Helsinki (with constant reports of the Russian military bombing of Mariupol on the radio), Fallen Leaves contains almost no digital technology. There are no careers, only jobs. No forward momentum. No children. Hell, there’s no one younger than 40 in the film, save for a synthwave duo that plays at protagonist Holappa’s local bar one evening. (The passion in their music stirs in him only the sadness to have another drink.) Even so, Ansa (Alma Pöysti) is interested in Holappa (Jussi Vatanen). They’re two townies firmly in middle age, wrapping themselves in the stoicism of a hard day’s work (industrial cleaning and shelf-stocking) and lonely beds. The emptiness of their lives and their city makes them seem destined to connect, but with Helsinki’s understated harshness, what vulnerability is left? The filmmaking mimics the characters’ stiffness with long static shots while costuming Holappa and Ansa in monochromatic reds and greens, as if suggesting that emotionality has to live somewhere, if only in vibrant dyes. To this end, Kaurismäki cuts a few corners in the film’s 81-minute runtime, using folk and pop songs to loudly express what Holappa and Ansa might feel. The audience can really hear the music. Can the characters? NR. CHANCE SOLEM-PFEIFER. Living Room. *** Throughout the ‘80s and ‘90s, the question of whether or not it was “real” dominated coverage of American professional wrestling. Were the rivalries genuine? Were the matches scripted? Now, with the benefit of hindsight, we can recognize that not only was it always fixed, but that obsessing over that aspect obfuscated the very real controversies endemic to the WWE that claimed the lives of Jeep Swenson, Owen Hart, and much of the Von Erich family, whose story is dramatized in A24′s The Iron Claw. Writer-director Sean Durkin (Martha Marcy May Marlene, The Nest) keeps this in mind, shooting the wrestling scenes with kayfabe (pulled punches and choreographed grapples that make the sport look more childish than intense) in full effect. But he doesn’t shy away from the very real physical toll that wrestling and steroid abuse had on brothers Kevin (Zac Efron), Kerry (Jeremy Allen White), David (Harris Dickinson) and Mike (Stanley Simons) as they struggled to live up to the impossible standards of their domineering father, Fritz (Holt McCallany). Even knowing what tragedies befell the family doesn’t soften the blow as brother after brother is chewed up and spat out under Fritz’s reign. It’s harrowing to watch, particularly for Kevin, the only one with a support network outside the ring (thanks to his wife, Pam, played by Lily James). Leaving his High School Musical and The Greatest Showman days far behind, Efron manages to convey earnestness and heartbreak while looking like a He-Man doll come to life. The Iron Claw can be agonizing, but it’s a well-crafted tragedy that puts you in an emotional headlock and keeps you there till the bell rings. R. MORGAN SHAUNETTE.

His latest offering, Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire, is derivative of previous films (notably Seven Samurai and Star Wars) and indefensible under close scrutiny, but it has sumptuous visuals and a game cast. Sofia Boutella leads the way as Kora, an ex-soldier living a quiet life on a farming planet. After a militaristic group called the Imperium shows up demanding shares of a harvest, Kora sets out to recruit warriors who will challenge them. A simple but entertaining sci-fi yarn that wears its influences on its sleeve, Rebel Moon includes everything from a robot voiced by Anthony Hopkins to a blacksmith flying on the back of a griffin. Being the first half of a two-part film, this entry contains a lot of story setup and expository dialogue, but Snyder can’t help himself when it comes to action, filling the fights with speed ramping and slow motion. His detractors won’t find anything to change their minds about him here, but Rebel Moon offers enough enjoyment for others seeking easy escapism. PG-13. DANIEL RESTER. Netflix. ** From Thief (1981) to Heat (1995), Michael Mann’s best films hinge on men whose all-consuming expertise destroys their emotional availability. If Ferrari is the 80-year-old directing icon’s final statement on that theme, it’s more haunted than ever by families broken and jobs well done. This snapshot biopic of Ferrari founder and patriarch Enzo (Adam Driver) finds the “Commendatore” (as his employees call him) at a low moment. It’s 1957. His company coffers are bare. His grief-stricken wife, Laura (Penélope Cruz), is fed up with his cheating, while his mistress (Shailene Woodley) has borne a secret heir to the Ferrari empire. The only antidote to this litany of human problems? Throw innovative aerodynamics and eager drivers into the meat grinder of the Mille Miglia. A win at this treacherous race, we’re told, would secure Enzo’s good fortunes. Ferrari is probably a better statement on Mann’s career than a standalone movie. Woodley and Cruz are cast in tough spots (with tough accents, too)—sad, angry women waiting to be recognized by an absent man—as the story roughly shifts gears from intimate drama to action that Enzo watches from the sidelines. Tougher still, liquid-looking visual effects mar the film’s most shocking moments. For both Michael Mann and Enzo, bodies of work overwhelm efforts. Boys and their toys to the last. R.

Shocker: We’re in the minds of director Yorgos Lanthimos and screenwriter Tony McNamara, the lurid stylists of The Favorite (2018). That film whipped up a soufflé of 18th century sexual intrigue, but Poor Things, based on Alasdair Gray’s novel, strides into Victorian England, where the automatonlike Bella is cared for/imprisoned by surgeon Dr. Godwin (Willem Dafoe) and his lackey Max (Ramy Youssef). Bella, jerky in movement and literal in speech, has a blunt innocence that inspires a wonderstruck Max to describe her as “a very pretty retard.” Few things betray shallowness of vision faster than a fetishization of the politically incorrect, but Lanthimos barrels on with his juvenile flourishes, blending Wes Andersonian whimsy with lame “witty” lines like, “Let us touch each other’s genital pieces!” By the time the director tacks on an extended homage to Freaks (1932), it’s excruciatingly clear that his affectations (monotone dialogue, steampunkish visuals) are a thin mask for his paucity of ideas. Only in the presence of Ruffalo, playing a sleazy and seductive lawyer, does the film vibrate with life. Adopting an English accent about as convincing as Spam packaged in a tin of Walker’s Shortbread, Ruffalo’s performance is the antidote to the artificial quirks of Poor Things. He’s so joyously fake that he’s scarily real. R. BENNETT CAMPBELL FERGUSON.

It’s generally understood that the tradition survives at prep academies and Ivy League institutions so that elites might legitimately dominate a team sport the poorer 99 percent consider too punishing, expensive and dull. But, as this new George Clooney-helmed passion project aches to prove, ‘twasn’t always so. Composed of orphaned scholarship cases, ex-trust funders dispossessed by the Depression, and semi-autistic amateur pianists, the ‘36 JV squad thrills a regatta-attending, newspaper-reading, under-entertained nation by winning boat races again and again (and again-—at the Berlin Olympics!). This, aside from some wispy flirtations thrust upon a coxswain (Callum Turner) living in his car and guest cameos by Jesse Owens and Hitler, is the film in its entirety. (To be fair, we’re also taught best practices: Keep the oars pointed in the same direction and exploit desperate strength born of generational poverty.) Even Angelina Jolie’s Unbroken, another entry in the microgenre of New Deal-era athlete biopics directed by Oscar-winning heartthrobs, employed Louis Zamperini’s trip to the Berlin games as a mere prelude for wartime ruminations on eroticized torture. The appeal of lads propelled forward through laborious craft is obvious, but The Boys in the Boat fails to do more than skim the surface both literally and metaphorically. PG-13. JAY HORTON.

"Jan 2, 2024",negative," I’ve long been of the opinion that Zack Snyder does his best work when he’s adapting someone else’s writing. Films like 300 or Dawn of the Dead work well because they suit his admittedly remarkable visual creativity but are not bogged down by his sometimes-shoddy storytelling. Snyder often has grand vision while also lacking the storytelling acumen to follow through on it, which is how we get messy projects like Batman V. Superman and Army of the Dead. These issues are thrust to the forefront of his newest epic idea, the space opera Rebel Moon, recently released via Netflix. Rebel Moon purports to be a far-flung, wild odyssey of a band of diverse heroes in a fictional universe fighting against the tyranny of The Motherworld. The story centers on Kora (capably portrayed by Sofia Boutella), a former soldier of the Motherworld who fled its grasp to try to find peace on the quiet planet of Veldt. Of course, the forces of the Motherworld — led by the sneering, vicious (yet oddly charming at times) Admiral Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein) come to this quiet little farming planet, seeking conquest and subjugation. In response, Kora begins a quest to find a collection of warriors to bring back to Veldt to help them defend themselves against Noble and his forces. What follows is a curious collection of recruitment missions, with Kora traipsing about the galaxy with a fellow farmer (Michael Huisman) and a recruited renegade pilot named Kai (Charlie Hunnam). Over time, they are joined by a lethal cyborg assassin (Doona Bae), a retired general and gladiator named Titus (Djimon Hounsou), a rebel leader named — hilariously — Darrian Bloodaxe (Ray Fisher), and a mysterious animal whisperer/blacksmith (Staz Nair). This collective eventually faces off against the Motherworld’s forces, setting the stage for the second film to be released in April 2024. Rebel Moon is a fascinating discussion point. It is, despite its proponents’ claims, hardly an original story. True, there are few original stories in science fiction anymore, and often stories will borrow from other sagas. It’s hardly an unusual practice. However, rarely does one borrow so heavily and so ham-fistedly as Snyder does here. Rebel Moon blurs that line between homage and copycatting clumsily, and it makes for distracting storytelling. This peculiar mashup of The Magnificent Seven (or Seven Samurai if you’re a purist), Star Wars, Mass Effect, and a half-dozen other stories is so obvious as to make it distracting. The film barely conceals its inspirations/source material, and it suffers for it.  It’s not helped by the fact that the film, despite its 134-minute runtime, still manages to feel rushed. There’s little time to understand the motivations of its characters, let alone get to know them since each recruitment is a ten-minute vignette that feels jammed in there just to get the story rolling. It’s awkward and jarring and throws the pacing of the film off completely. Of course, this will theoretically be resolved with the inevitable (and publicized) release of a director’s cut, but there’s no guarantee that expanding upon these issues will actually improve them. That’s not even covering the fact that deliberately cutting a movie down with the intent of re-releasing its full version later is such a commercially crass plan in the first place (and a clear-cut case of Netflix trying to capitalize on the success of Snyder’s Justice League Snydercut shenanigans).
Where the film often does succeed is in its visual flair and Snyder’s gift for action choreography. While he still over-relies on slow-motion, he continues to impress with how he assembles an action scene, with flawless lighting and solid effects work combined with top-notch direction. And for what it’s worth, the actors mostly do well with what little they’re often given. Boutella, whose dancer background gives her a natural physicality, holds her own here as a star in a film filled with other more well-known names, and her costars both perform well while also giving her breathing room. It’s a nicely rounded cast, even if they’re stuck with some often derivative and stilted dialogue. It’s with all this said that it becomes hard to say whether Rebel Moon is a good or bad film. On the one hand, how do you judge a film that does some things well, but that’s literally being released incomplete? On the other hand, there’s no denying its failures in writing and originality, and those are things that cannot be remedied in its future cut. Even more puzzling is why Netflix chose to do things this way. They’ve obviously invested serious money in the project — why not simply turn it into an episodic project and give the story room to grow more organically instead of this weirdly bumpy film that feels as hastily assembled as its team of heroes? It’s puzzling. At the end of the day, Rebel Moon (technically, it’s Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire but who has time to keep typing that out) isn’t a terrible film — certainly not worth the drubbing it’s been receiving. But there are so many parts of it that struggle to work cohesively, so many square pegs hammered into round holes, that it becomes difficult to call it good, either. Perhaps a director’s cut will serve it well, even if that very concept is infuriating in this context. Perhaps it will expand upon its flaws and expose them further. What is clear is that regardless, Rebel Moon is a visually arresting, occasionally exciting film that borrows far too heavily from its predecessors to truly be called an original Snyder project and suffers far too much from some strange combination of ego and greed to even be viewed on its own merits. Maybe you should just wait for the directors cut … but then again, maybe that won’t help at all. Only time will tell."
"Jan 2, 2024",negative," La vida en la comunidad agrícola del planeta Veidt es sencilla pero satisfactoria. Bajo el liderazgo de Sindri (Corey Stoll), los hombres y mujeres trabajan incansablemente para labrar la tierra árida. Pero esto cambia cuando un día Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein) llega con un ejército. La mano derecha del dictador Balisarius (Fra Fee), que gobierna el Mundo Madre con mano de hierro, busca rebeldes que se atrevan a enfrentarse al imperio. Se supone que el pueblo debe proporcionar suficiente comida al ejército. Cuando Sindri intenta rechazar esta petición, estalla un enfrentamiento violento. Ahora depende de Kora (Sofia Boutella), que vino a Veidt hace algún tiempo, y Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) detener el desastre. Encuentran el apoyo del piloto Kai (Charlie Hunnam) y de algunos otros que no hablan bien del Imperio. Los fanáticos de Star Wars  están pasando por momentos difíciles en este momento, al menos cuando se trata de aventuras en la pantalla grande. No ha habido una película desde el desastroso ""El ascenso de Skywalker” hace cuatro años. Posteriormente se planearon varios otros títulos. Pero han sido cancelados, están atrapados en el infierno del desarrollo o simplemente han desaparecido de la faz de la tierra. Así que en realidad es bueno que Rebel Moon - Part 1: Child of Fire sea una película que está claramente basada en la famosa saga. De hecho, Zack Snyder intentó vender su historia como parte oficial de Star War en su momento, pero fue rechazada por Disney. Warner tampoco estaba interesado, a pesar de que el estudio trabajó mucho con Snyder a través de las películas de DC Comics. Sólo muchos años después todo el asunto llegó al servicio de streaming en cuestión. Zack Snyder se toma su tiempo para presentar a la comunidad agrícola. Aquí no sucede mucho, muchos de los diálogos son bastante planos o solo sirven para brindar exposición. Pero a estas alturas todavía tienes la sensación de que todo esto es sólo el preludio de una gran aventura. Sin embargo, la apertura de la reunión en el bar es claramente la mejor parte de la película. Porque en cuanto comienza la reunión de aliados, al estilo de ""Los siete samuráis"", ""Rebel Moon"" se vuelve aburrida durante largos periodos. Esto también tiene que ver con las figuras intercambiables que cobran protagonismo a partir de ahora. Todos los personajes previamente establecidos –excepto Kora y Gunnar– y sus conflictos desaparecen. Hay, por ejemplo, un joven soldado imperial que también parece tener un lado bueno y muestra remordimiento. De repente desaparece, y esa es más la regla que la excepción en esta película: si alguien es excitante o siente cierta fascinación (como el ex robot de combate ""Jimmy"", cuya brillante voz fue interpretada por Anthony Hopkins en la versión original en inglés) , entonces eso es todo. Demasiado pronto tendrá que dejar paso al equipo de los ""Siete Samuráis"", en gran parte reemplazable. Aunque los siete samuráis espaciales de la versión original en inglés a veces hablan con acentos absurdos (pero no siempre los mantienen), con excepción de Gunnar, ninguno de ellos se convierte en personajes de carne y hueso. Es significativo que antes del gran enfrentamiento, poco antes del final se dedique una secuencia completa a explicarnos quiénes son realmente todas estas personas y qué motivaciones tienen para participar en esta aventura. Esto es muy necesario porque, a pesar de nuestro viaje anterior juntos, no entendimos casi ninguno de ellos. Ya sea Kai, el musculoso Tarak (Staiz Nair), el luchador con sable láser Nemesis (Doona Bae), el ex general Titus (Djimon Hounsou) , que simplemente es etiquetado como ""genio"", o el líder rebelde Darrian Bloodaxe (Ray Fisher) - todos siguen siendo completamente irrelevantes. Esto también reduce el impacto del final, en el que de repente se supone que debes apoyarlos mientras enfrentan heroicamente una posible muerte. La acción, que Snyder, por supuesto, ideó nuevamente con su confidente cercano y experto en acrobacias personales Damon Caro, no hace mucho para que los eventos de ""Rebel Moon"" sean más emocionantes. Hay momentos breves que destacan: un movimiento hábil, un genial golpe con la espada o cómo Snyder ilustra el increíble poder de penetración de las armas de fuego en un largo flashback en el que el misterio del pasado de Kora se revela sorprendentemente desde el principio. Pero la mayor parte de la acción carece de potencia y energía, al menos en la versión que ahora se lanza por primera vez en Netflix. Por supuesto, esta accidentada historia no da muchas esperanzas de que el resultado sea excelente. Además, la participación de Snyder en películas de superhéroes terminó sin gloria. Pero hay que dejar atrás una cosa: aunque rara vez tenían algo bueno, eran claramente mejores que el monstruo de ciencia ficción que aquí se desata sobre el público. La primera irritación es cuánto se copia la situación original de Una nueva esperanza . ¿Un imperio malvado que gobierna la galaxia y tiene tendencias fascistas? ¿Un planeta remoto, sin importancia y lleno de agricultores donde comienza la aventura? ¿Una escena en un bar lleno de extrañas criaturas? ¿Un robot parlante? ¿Un piloto al que le gusta trabajar al borde de la ilegalidad? Todo esto es muy atrevido. Más tarde, Snyder rompe con este modelo y descubre otro. Toda la parte central consta de Kora, Gunnar y Kai volando por el espacio en busca de compañeros de armas. Al final terminas con un equipo de siete -por casualidad, por supuesto- tal como lo hicieron Los Siete Samuráis y Los Siete Magníficos . Es discutible si es mejor robar descaradamente dos películas en lugar de solo una. De cualquier manera, con Rebel Moon – Parte 1: Child of Fire esperas  mucho tiempo para ver tu propia idea. En cambio, hay dos horas y media de citas. Incluso como un fanfiction anónimo en Internet, esto habría sido una vergüenza. Esto es inaceptable para una película increíblemente cara. Ahora bien, existe el conocido dicho: más vale robar que mal inventar. Puede que sea cierto: no todas las películas tienen por qué ofrecer algo completamente nuevo. Es que esto no se roba bien. De hecho, no sabes qué es peor: la total falta de visión propia o la pésima implementación. Lo malo, por ejemplo, es que las distintas personas que se reúnen en torno al dúo inicial no tienen ninguna posibilidad de convertirse en un personaje. Hay una escena introductoria para cada uno, después de la cual no tienen mucho que hacer. Lo que es molesto, por ejemplo, es cómo se presenta a Tarak (Nair ) en Rebel Moon - Parte 1: Child of Fire  como alguien que tiene una gran empatía hacia los animales. Inmediatamente después, sin embargo, aplaude a la maestra de espada Némesis (Bae) cuando mata a una mujer araña que intenta proteger a sus hijos de los humanos. Si vas a dibujar las figuras tan finamente, al menos hazlo de manera consistente. Y luego está la acción. Es bien sabido que Synder tiene una inexplicable obsesión por las escenas en cámara lenta, como ha demostrado hasta la saciedad en otras películas. Las cosas se ponen tan mal aquí que a veces uno se pregunta si no querrá parodiar sus propias obras. Está hecho de manera tan cruda y genial, pero tan repetitivo y carente de dinámica que simplemente verlo se convierte en una tortura. Rebel Moon - Parte 1: Child of Fire mejora un poco cuando la película no intenta transmitir ningún contenido o acción, sino que simplemente muestra paisajes. Tampoco son demasiado creativos y obviamente se crean en la computadora, pero son bastante agradables. Sin embargo, eso por sí solo difícilmente justifica tener que hacer todo el resto. Si tan solo todo fuera al menos de alguna manera divertido, como las escenas involuntariamente divertidas con Ed Skrein, que aquí cede por completo a la sobreactuación. Pero ni siquiera eso: la excursión a nuevos mundos termina en un aterrizaje forzoso en el que se desperdició mucho dinero, talento y tiempo. Rubén Peralta Rigaud nació en Santo Domingo en 1980.

"Jan 1, 2024",negative," Andrew Haigh, the director of Weekend and 45 Years, has made an emotionally powerful film that represents a contemporary queer take on Field of Dreams. After all, it isn’t only heterosexual boomer farmers from Iowa who would love the chance to interact and settle all their issues, with their long-dead parents.  Based on a Japanese novel called Strangers, the film stars Andrew Scott (from Fleabag) as a lonely writer named Adam who lives in a gleaming but mysteriously empty apartment complex in London. One day he meets a neighbor named Harry (Paul Mescal) and they fall into a passionate affair. At the same time, Adam suddenly gains the ability to visit his childhood home and interact with the ghosts of his parents (Jamie Bell and Claire Foy), who were killed in a crash when he was 12 years old.  He essentially speed-runs the experience of connecting with them and coming out to them — while explaining that life for gay people has changed a lot since they died in the late 1980s. He eventually comes to terms with their deaths- only doing so as an adult rather than as a child. It’s all very affecting and beautifully rendered- and, I gather, Haigh shot the scenes in his own childhood home.  It’s yet another Searchlight Pictures movie that feels like an A24 movie, and fans of last year’s Aftersun will be gladdened to know that Paul Mescal dancing in a club is once again an important part of the film.  There are going to be many, many arguments about the ending, both what it means and whether or not it “ruins” the movie. I think it works, but the arguments it’s going to start are half the fun.  Michael Mann has returned with his first film since Blackhat eight years ago. It’s a tightly focused biopic of Italian car impresario Enzo Ferrari, played this time by Adam Driver.  It’s a compelling movie, certainly, Mann’s best since Miami Vice back in 2006, although (pardon the pun) it never finds that extra gear. Ford v. Ferrari, from back in 2019 but set a decade after this film’s events — but also featuring a Big Race at the End — was a better version of a similar idea.  The film is set in 1957 and focuses on a specific moment: Still grieving his recently deceased son, Enzo Ferrari is presiding over the Mille Miglia race, while also considering selling a stake in his company. He’s also juggling his wife Laura (Penelope Cruz) and a mistress Lina (Shailene Woodley). Laura, at least nominally, is all right with the mistresses, both less all right with her husband having a secret son.  Yes, this is the second movie in the past three years in which Adam Driver plays the head of a famous Italian corporation and has sex with a woman on a table. It recalls Driver’s 2019 parlay of Marriage Story and The Report, both of which featured scenes in which a lawyer tells Driver’s character he has to pay a retainer that he’ll never be able to afford.  I had no trouble buying Driver as an Italian but had a bit more trouble buying the 40-year-old actor as a man who was about 20 years older than that at the time. And while Cruz can do anything, I had much more trouble buying Woodley as an Italian.  George Clooney, as a director, made an above-average movie right out of the gate with Confessions of a Dangerous Mind and followed it up with a near-masterpiece in Good Night and Good Luck. Since then, it’s been nothing but duds. It’s almost impressive, honestly.  No, it’s not as bad as Suburbicon or Leatherheads, but Clooney’s latest film, The Boys in the Boat, is a completely perfunctory underdog sports movie that embraces every single cliche of the genre.  Based on a popular book of the same name, The Boys in the Boat is about a rowing team from the University of Washington, in the 1930s, who got to compete at the Olympics in 1936- you know, the ones in Berlin that were presided over by Hitler.  The story is just told in the most uninteresting way possible, with the rowers all played by Generic Handsome Actors. When the characters meet Jesse Owens, it made me wish I was watching a movie about him, instead.  I can think of three different movies off the top of my head that were set at the 1936 Olympics and were better than this one-  even the one directed by Leni Riefenstahl that was pure Nazi propaganda.  I’m kind of getting sick of “it’ll all make sense once you see the forthcoming director’s cut that’s an hour longer” being used as a defense of movies that I didn’t like. I didn’t buy that when it was about Napoleon, either.  That’s the case here with Zack Snyder’s latest spectacle, now on Netflix. which lifts all sorts of aspects of Star Wars, from its stated Kurosawa influence to actual red light sabers. It’s so Star Wars-inspired that it even officially began life as a Star Wars movie that Snyder wanted to make at one point.  I made my peace with the Snyder Cut and even kind of liked it, though I’m not about to justify that fanboy toxicity that went on for several years. Snyder has clear passion and talent, but this one is a dud- way too plagued by mumbo jumbo. Part II is coming in April, but I don’t expect to remember much about Part I a week from now, much less in four months. "
"Dec 31, 2023",negative," Let’s start with the good news.  Rebel Moon is cinematically amazing with insane makeup, costumes, production design enhanced by strong grounded performances, stunts and fight scenes led by Sofia Boutella, Ed Skrein, Michiel Huisman, Ray Fisher, Djimon Hounsou and Charlie Hunnam. The first 40 minutes circle around an epic science-fantasy event where this peaceful colony on the edge of a galaxy finds itself threatened by armies of a tyrannical ruling force. Kora (Sofia Boutella), a mysterious stranger living among the villagers, becomes their best hope for survival. Tasked with finding trained fighters who will unite with her in making an impossible stand against the Mother World, Kora assembles a small band of warriors, outsiders, insurgents, peasants and orphans of war from different worlds who share a common need for redemption and revenge. As the shadow of an entire Realm bears down on the unlikeliest of moons, a battle over the fate of a galaxy is waged, and in the process, a new army of heroes is formed.That’s a lot right? If you think that description is a lot to read imagine watching this film knowing there is a part two. At first glance, this epic adventure starts out both barrels blazing Listen, I love sci-fi and I especially love the Star Wars universe.  Rebel Moon: Part One: A Child of Fire replicates all that is familiar and worked immensely well for that Disney franchise.  It boasts  fabulous fight scenes that are synonymous with Zach Snyder’s style and brand of filmmaking.  There is never a dull action moment and leading lady Sofia Boutella as Kora holds her own while holding down the film. Having said that, a few of the fight scenes could have been cut a bit short as could the entire film whose running time clocks in around 133 minutes.  While I enjoying having a woman lead the charge in a franchise of film usually reserved for male characters, the overall pacing is uneven making this film a chore in some spots.  It’s crystal clear that George Lucas’ Star Wars has had some major impact on Snyder’s filmmaking prowess, which isn’t a bad thing and would be great if it took it up a notch – which it does not."
"Dec 31, 2023",neutral," El nuevo proyecto del director de Watchmen (2009) y Batman v Superman (2016) es la combinación de docenas de universos mayores, que el cineasta utiliza a discreción y sin ninguna solidez. Sensiblera, cursi y llena de problemas narrativos, es unaobra pobre y extraña que desmerece la sublimación de la space opera que intenta ser. Rebel Moon Parte 1, la esperada película de Zack Snyder, comienza con una narración genérica acerca de una guerra entre mundos y la descripción, a grandes rasgos, de una mitología mayor. También, con la exploración superficial — como todo en el argumento escrito por Snyder, Shay Hatten y Kurt Johnstad — de la vida de un planeta a la periferia de las grandes luchas, másparecido a un descampado que a un futuro núcleo de una rebelión. Si todo lo anterior resulta familiar, es porque lo es. El director, que a menudo ha admitido que toma ideas y propuestas mayores de otras sagas, tomó la decisión de crear un relato a su medida. Pero eso, a partir de otras tantas franquicias e historias cinematográficas. Todas unidas y recombinadas, de forma endeble y poco convincente en la primera parte de lo que se anuncia como una duología. Pero quizás, el mayor error de Rebel Moon en su conjunto es que su relato avance específicamente sobre la promesa de que, en el futuro, lo que propone se completará. En el mejor de los casos, se profundizará en sus aproximaciones con cuidado. Sin embargo, por ahora, no hay tiempo. La gran sensación que deja a su paso la cinta es que todos los puntos que toca, apenasmuestran su valor y sentido. Que cada personaje — y hay docenas, de todos los lugares y especies imaginables — tendrá una segunda oportunidad para volver sobre su historia. Pero, mientras tanto, la película apenas presta atención a cualquiera de ellos. Poco a poco, lo que comienza como una propuesta pequeña — y que podría funcionar desde sus límites muy precisos — se expande sin que la historia siga su rápida evolución. Del planeta colonia, tomado rehén por una facción del llamado Planeta Madre (que cumple la misma función, en peso e importancia, que el Imperio intergaláctico de George Lucas), la película avanza hacia diversos frentes. El esencial a tener en cuenta: la búsqueda de un equipo de guerreros rebeldes que permitan al grupo de pacíficos campesinos, enfrentar un ataque mayor.  Pero el guion es tan torpe y la mezcla de elementos tan disparatada, que la historia avanza a tropezones entre docenas de escenarios distintos. Todos, tomados de otras narraciones mejores y más profundas. Kora (Sofia Boutella), líder accidental en busca de refuerzos, debe encontrar a Kai (Charlie Hunnam), el Han Solo de esta historia. Después, recorrer algunos mundos genéricos en busca del resto del equipo y volver, para enfrentar el mal que amenaza el cosmos. Mientras todo lo anterior sucede, la trama no presta la menor atención a sus héroes. Cada personaje parece parte de un estereotipo mayor, descrito sin mucho interés. Pero lo más lamentable es la falta de exploración del largometraje en todo lo que propone. Los símbolos se acumulan escena a escena, solo para ser mostrados a medias u olvidados casi de inmediato. Loque resulta aún peor: convertirse en una mezcla poco afortunada de líneas de discurso huérfanas. La narrativa de Rebel Moon es tan pobre, como para encontrarse sumido en una torpeza que aumenta secuencia a secuencia. Un villano maligno trajeado como un nazi, un bar galáctico tan parecido a los mostrados en Star Wars que resulta paródicos. Luchas y batallas cuerpo a cuerpo, ralentizadas para mayor gloria de cuerpos perfectos y pechos desnudos masculinos.  Rebel Moon parece acumular todos los vicios de Zack Snyder en un solo lugar. Sublimarlos y volverlos cada vez más extraños. Estereotipos vacíos que delinean una historia tan ambiciosa que se anuncia como el preludio de cientos de relatos, que se ampliarán antes o después. Solo que no se hace ahora y la película se desploma con la misma rapidez que su premisafacilona.  De Star Wars a la franquicia Harry Potter, franquicia de la que toma una escena central y la copia casi cuadro a cuadro. Zack Snyder no se sonroja al imitar con pulso torpe una serie de referentes que descompone en alegorías que rozan con demasiada frecuencia lo ridículo y lo sensiblero. Todo, para, al final, la película quedarse a medias, sostenida con fragilidad sobre la posibilidad que cada cosa mal construida se desarrolle mejor en adelante.  Pero Rebel Moon necesita más que una secuela — que se estrenará en abril — para sostener su discurso vacío, su simbología cursi y el mal uso de sus propuestas. Incluso la fotografía — plana, con aspecto de efectos especiales de segunda y lleno de errores de iluminación — desmerece el esfuerzo en conjunto que este universo intenta sostener sin lograrlo. Al final, la anunciada space opera de Zack Snyder no es otra cosa que una versión tardía, de mal gusto y blanda, de conceptos superiores.

"Dec 31, 2023",neutral,"Zack Snyder’s ambitious sci-fi endeavor is more video game than film, which is a good thing for some, but might be boring for others."
"Dec 31, 2023",negative," One of the worst things a movie can be is boring. The boredom can be heightened when the genre has a typical energy to it, mainly science fiction or horror, two genres that often naturally have a zest that captures my attention. Rebel Moon-Part One: A Child of Fire is a shocking kind of boring. The newest film from embattled director Zack Snyder is a rejected Star Wars project, adding in some of his standard signature tropes, but failing to elevate beyond something rote and derivative. Rebel Moon- Part One delivers little reason to look forward to Part Two. The film opens with a long-winded monologue by Anthony Hopkins, talking about a place called the Motherworld, where the ruler was killed and a group of space Nazis is in power, looking to control all the planets in the galaxy. The first setting is the farming planet of Veldt. We meet Kora (Sofia Boutella), a one-time soldier of the Motherworld, looking for peace in the simple village. When admiral Atticus Nobel (Ed Skrein) and his goons arrive, things become volatile, with Kora revealing her assassin skills, and escaping with grain manager Gunnar (Michiel Huisman). They go in search of a team to fight against the fascist regime. It’s The Seven Samurai in outer space or any other science fiction-western combo you have seen before. Going forward, the narrative is a redundant sequence of introducing us to new characters to join Kora’s team, including Han Solo replica Kai (played by Charlie Hunnam), a griffin tamer named Tarak (Staz Nair), a lightsaber-wielding swordsman named Nemesis (Bae Doona), and a once-beloved war general Titus (Djimon Hounsou in a role far beneath him). By the time the entire team is gathered, it’s hard not to be tuned out, as Snyder, along with co-writers Kurt Johnstad and Shay Hatten think character mugging for the camera, odd-looking space creatures, and little bursts of action are enough to engage us. Sadly, it’s dull and mundane by all science fiction standards. Even as Zach Snyder has had his fair share of highs and lows, Rebel Moon may be his lowest, both from a story and action angle. There is not a single set piece to praise nor a character to appreciate. Boutella is not charismatic enough to lead and her dialogue reading is stiffer than a board. The blame isn’t solely on her, as from a visual aspect, the CGI is distracting, and there is not a single setting outside a studio lot. The highest marks I can give are to Skrien, who has a hideous haircut and performs for the back row, and a lone sequence where Jena Malone plays a venomous spider who is gnarly enough to be amused by. That’s about all I have. Rebel Moon- Part One: A Child of Fire is a misfire of epic proportions. Where Army of the Dead was a fresh riff on zombies and Snyder’s Justice League showed his complete vision, Rebel Moon is none of that. It’s not hindered by Snyder’s style, which tends to be dragged down by his joy of slow-motion, but instead is ruined by an unoriginal and unimaginative production. It’s boring and cliched. It can’t be saved by a SnyderCut version because this is Netflix and an excuse like that just won’t work. Rebel Moon is completely lost in space."
"Dec 31, 2023",negative," “Rebel Moon: Parte 1 – la niña del fuego” representa el más reciente intento por Zack Snyder de desarrollar un universo cinematográfico —no en el cine (como cuando estuvo haciendo películas para DC), si no más bien para Netflix (como cuando estrenó “El ejército de los muertos” hace un par de años). El problema es que, en vez de crear algo original o siquiera relativamente novedoso, todo lo que ha hecho es agarrar un guion que originalmente se iba a llevar a cabo en el universo “Star Wars”, y cambiar algunos nombres. No es una exageración decir que “Rebel Moon: Parte 1 – la niña del fuego” se parece MUCHÍSIMO a “Star Wars”, tanto así que Lucasfilm debería considerar tomar acciones legales. Díganme, si no, si es que la trama no les suena familiar. En un planeta remoto, una granjera llamada Kora (Sofía Boutella) se da cuenta de que debe reaccionar ante la crueldad del Imperium, representado por el sádico Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein) cuando este llega a su pueblo y comienza a abusar de medio mundo. Es así que decide escapar junto a su compañero Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) para reclutar a otros guerreros que los puedan ayudar. Primero llegan a un exótico bar lleno de Aliens donde conocen al rebelde Kai (Charlie Hunnam), y luego salen del planeta para encontrar al legendario General Titus (Djimon Hoynsou), a la honorable Nemesis (Doona Bae), e incluso al aguerrido Bloodaxe (Ray Fisher). Juntos, tendrán que enfrentarse al ya mencionado Noble, quien en realidad trabaja para un cruel senador llamado Balisarius (Fra Fee), quien se autodeclaró emperador de la galaxia cuando el Rey (Cary Elwes) fue asesinado años atrás. Claramente, nuestra protagonista tiene algún tipo de conexión con el rey (no podía tratarse de una mujer común y corriente). Ah, y al menos al inicio, también tenemos a un robot llamado Jimmy (¡¡!!) con la voz de Anthony Hopkins, a quien me hubiese gustado ver más. En pocas palabras: tenemos un Imperio (digo, IMPERIUM) maligno controlado por un senador, a un antagonista sádico, a una protagonista especial, y hasta personajes que blanden espadas sospechosamente parecidas a un sable de luz. Es todo extremadamente parecido a “Star Wars”, pero sin nada del encanto o gracia o sensación de descubrimiento que aquellas películas (especialmente las de Lucas) nos hacían sentir. Más bien, todo ha sido reemplazado por un tono solemne y serio, en donde los malos intentan abusar sexualmente de chicas (¡!), y el Noble de Skrein se dedica a matar y torturar y engañar gente de la forma más sádica posible. No me sorprende que la ya anunciada Versión del Director sea para mayores de 18 años. Nada de eso sería un problema grave si es que la película fuese entretenida o incluyese algún elemento relativamente novedoso, pero ese no es el caso. Un filme de fantasía o ciencia ficción no tiene que ser increíblemente original para resultar exitoso —pregúntenle, si no, a James Cameron y su franquicia de “Avatar”. Pero si aquellas producciones las termina viendo todo el mundo y su abuelita, es precisamente porque el CÓMO termina siendo más interesante que el QUÉ; la construcción fascinante de un universo, y efectos visuales incomparables. En el caso de “Rebel Moon: Parte 1 – la niña del fuego”, ni el “qué” ni el “cómo” terminan de cuajar, lo que resulta en una experiencia tediosa y absolutamente previsible. Tampoco ayuda, además, que esta primera parte no sea más que una introducción. El filme cuenta con un desenlace, sí, pero igual acaba con un final abierto, el cual lo deja a uno con la sensación de que recién ha visto una introducción —y una introducción, encima, que nos cuenta poco o nada de sus protagonistas. Kora, por ejemplo, es un personaje plano, del que nos vamos enterando un poco a través de “flashbacks”, pero que nunca demuestra tener una personalidad interesante. Y de sus compañeros se puede decir incluso menos —cada uno tiene una introducción suficientemente intrigante, pero una vez que Kora los recluta, Snyder no haca absolutamente NADA con ellos. Es alucinante. Del apartado visual no me puedo quejar, al menos. Snyder sigue insistiendo en usar lentes personalizados de poca distancia focal, lo cual le da una sensación de ensueño a la película entera —apropiado para la temática, supongo. Y la mayoría de efectos visuales son impresionantes – el robot Jimmy (todavía no puedo superar su nombre), por ejemplo, luce increíblemente realista. Puede que Snyder no haya desarrollado una buena historia en esta ocasión, pero al menos sigue demostrando que tiene buen ojo para componer imágenes interesantes y de gran impacto. Sin embargo, sí me sorprendió que “Rebel Moon: Parte 1 – la niña del fuego” fuese una cinta de poca acción. Los pocos combates que incluye son entretenidos —aunque, para variar, suelen abusar de las cámaras lentas—, pero el problema es, precisamente, que no hay suficientes. El resto del filme está compuesto de exposición torpe (generalmente a través de diálogo forzado), “flashbacks”, y situaciones robadas de mejores filmes como “Star Wars”, “Duna” y hasta “Harry Potter”. Los actores, por su parte, hacen lo que pueden, pero el único que parece estar divirtiéndose es Ed Skrein. Interpretar a un villano sádico y cruel, supongo, siempre resulta entretenido —especialmente cuando el resto del reparto parece estar a punto de quedarse dormido. En fin. “Rebel Moon: Parte 1 – la niña del fuego” me decepcionó a sobremanera. Estoy siempre dispuesto a darle una oportunidad a producciones originales de género y de gran presupuesto; el problema acá es que la palabra “original” no podría estar más fuera de lugar. “Rebel Moon: Parte 1 – la niña del fuego” es una amalgamación de otras historias (mejores y más interesantes), mezcladas sin tener en cuenta los aspectos emocionales, intelectuales o siquiera divertidos que la gente podría estar buscando en una nueva película. El resultado es una de las peores películas de Zack Snyder, un cineasta talentoso que ha sido responsable de filmes verdaderamente buenos (“El amanecer de los muertos”, “300”, “Watchmen”, su versión de “La liga de la justicia”), pero que acá, aparentemente, se quedó sin nada qué decir. Habrá que esperar hasta abril, pues, para ver si logra concluir esta historia de mejor manera con la segunda parte de “Rebel Moon”. Comunicador audiovisual y crítico de cine.

"Dec 30, 2023",negative," Less homage to Star Wars than it is a pastiche of that cultural juggernaut, a strong sense of déjà vu hangs over Zack Snyder’s Rebel Moon. Unfortunately, in plainly appealing to the memory of its vastly superior inspiration so many times, it inadvertently reminds viewers of how much better its muse is. There are far too many direct copycat scenes here for Rebel Moon to craft anything like an identity of its own, but its derivativeness might be forgivable were it not so self-consciously, humorlessly straining for epicness. Rebel Moon rises with narration from Anthony Hopkins and an operatic score — a promise of grandness it never lives up to. At two-hours-plus, this dreadnought announces its lofty ambitions for future franchise status at every turn, but never once earns it: the dialogue is creakingly expository and the acting is spotty, ultimately making it feel like the film has lazily assumed it's already secured all the interest it needs to justify a potential two further sequels and a galaxy of tie-in media. Though there are bright spots that suggest an actual movie lurks somewhere deep within its 134 minutes, Rebel Moon instead feels like a laborious couple of hours of scene-setting that arrogantly banks on you returning for more, despite doing little to deserve any more of your time. There are moments when Rebel Moon nearly earns its self-seriousness, like the gripping introduction of Bae Doona’s lightsaber-wielding Nemesis, or the moment Boutella’s Kora rouses Djimon Hounsou’s disgraced, depressed military general with an appeal not to his honor but to his desire for revenge. Unfortunately, these glints of the film redeeming itself are almost entirely diluted in the general narrative sludge that surrounds them, and thus can’t do much to entice you back for the director’s cut that Netflix has cynically already teased, despite having the power to have simply released that instead. Co-produced by Pedro Almodóvar, this tumultuous Argentine anthology film tests the limits of human sanity when pushed to the extremes – and will also test yours."
"Dec 29, 2023",neutral," Bereft of new ideas, beholden to silly slo-mo shenanigans, let it be known that writer/director Zack Snyder’s Rebel Moon is only truly harmful to those of us who care about proper punctuation. Netflix appears to have it as Rebel Moon — Part One: A Child of Fire. Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB have it as Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire. What in the em dash is going on here? Where does the colon belong?! That’s a weird question to be asking, given that a subset of Snyder’s fandom is so toxic they almost certainly have their heads in the orifice necessary to locate that organ. Punctuation contemplation is more thought than anyone else has invested in anything involving Rebel: Moon: Part: One: A: Child: Of: Fire. That joke was low-hanging fruit, but this is pretty much Low-Hanging Fruit — The Movie. And that’s okay sometimes! Hodgepodging together various elements of the timeless epic monomyth and throwing in some mildly original element, like say a wizard wand, can be pretty profitable! J.K. But not really. The problem is that Snyder didn’t throw in anything even mildly original. He literally pitched Star Wars executives on a redundant Seven Samurai in Space “idea” that was remade as recently as season one of The Mandalorian. When they passed, Netflix gave him eleventy billion dollars to do it anyway, without using Lucasfilm intellectual property. There are still glowing space swords, intergalactic governmental oppressors who shop at Nazi Gap, and even problematic parentage. Everyone must applaud the restraint Snyder showed in not introducing a tiny-but-powerful character who speaks backwards named Adoy. If you find yourself saying “A’doy” frequently, you won’t be alone. The entirety of Rebel Moon’s first installment would be a minutes-long montage in most movies. Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein), a galactic Goebbels, shows up to a small farming planet and says “feed our army or we’ll kill you all.” This doesn’t sit well with Kora (Sofia Boutella), who has a complicated past she doesn’t like talking about. Do you think maybe she’s good at killing stuff? Kora and Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) skip around the universe picking up antiheroes to assist the farmers in fighting the fascists. That’s right, the whole stinkin’ thing is the “I know just the person we need, if only they’ll agree to help” scene from a billion other better films. Snyder, notoriously addicted to slowed motion, has reached his zenith by making an entire movie out of a montage. It’s not a movie, actually. Legally, sure. Technically, yes. But realistically? No. This is the introduction to characters like Nemesis (Bae Doona), Bloodaxe (Ray Fisher), and Titus (Djimon Hounsou), which are names given to characters by actual grownups. There’s also a robot voiced by Anthony Hopkins named Jimmy. He wears a set of antlers at one point. Nothing really happens, other than the group is assembled. The fight at the end is so wholly inconsequential that it really only serves to finally reveal who are main character actually is. It feels like a prequel to a movie series that doesn’t exist. Snyder’s unique visual flair is quasi-irresistible. The recycled parts from better stories gin up just enough interest. The unoriginality doesn’t hit as offensive, just lazy. And although everything feels like a video game cut scene that introduces playable characters…they would probably be fun to play with? Again, to be clear, this is not a movie. It isn’t even really the first part of a movie. It is a live-action adaptation of the cast of characters. The biggest fear here is that streaming services without concerns about theatrical experiences who are content to blur the line between TV series and movies are producing mushy messes that don’t work as either content form. If this is the next step in the degradation of cinema, wow is it hilarious that the horseman of the apocalypse…is Zack Snyder. Gissane Sophia at Marvelous Geeks Media says “It’s hard to decipher who we’re meant to trust and what relationship we’re meant to invest in here. In no way, shape, or form does Rebel Moon Part One feel like it knows what it wants to be.” Siddhant Adlakha at Joy Sauce says “While it avoids Hollywood’s penchant for orientalism, and instead uses its designs to create an explicit anti-imperial and anti-colonial text, it fails to live up to both its eastern and western influences, and exists only as a mal-formed piece of marketing for something better.” D.R. Medlen at The Mary Sue says “Rebel Moon puts the Snyder spin on a space epic and delivers a wild ride from start to finish. It’s not Shakespeare, but it sure is fun.”"
"Dec 29, 2023",negative," Permit me to take a short stroll down memory lane: It’s 1977, and I have convinced my parents to take me to the movie theater at the Tyrone Gardens in St. Petersburg to see “Star Wars” — not “Star Wars: Episode IV — A New Hope,” because no one knew that this was the first film in what would become a multibillion-dollar franchise. When I viewed the film for the first time, it was still just “Star Wars,” an epic space opera boasting a narrative built upon a mythic structure model with traditional archetypes. It was still just gratifying sci-fi fantasy, with space battles and laser swords. Soon, the film would become embedded in popular culture, with creator and director George Lucas reaping the benefits of a merchandising juggernaut. The success of the first “Star Wars” film enabled Lucas to make more films — both sequels and prequels — and to expand his fictional universe as he explored the “Skywalker Saga.” But before “Star Wars” became a pop culture phenomenon, Lucas had no guarantee there would be a continuation of the series. The original “Star Wars” works as a standalone story, conveyed in an easy-to-follow three-act structure that clearly identifies the struggle between good and evil and provides the audience with a satisfying resolution to the conflicts. It requires no follow-up, but it depicts such wonderfully rendered compelling characters in vivid settings that the audience wants to see more: more adventures, more alien worlds, and, well, more merchandise. The first problem with “Rebel Moon — Part One: A Child of Fire” is that it lacks a satisfying resolution to the conflicts it introduces. Directed by Zack Snyder, the first installment of the epic space opera was released in select theaters on Dec. 15 before making its streaming debut on Netflix on Dec. 21. Synder also intends to drop an extended cut in early 2024, before releasing “Rebel Moon — Part Two: The Scargiver” on April 19. The film revolves around Kora (Sofia Boutella), a woman with a mysterious past who has been embraced by a peaceful settlement of farmers on the moon Veldt. When Admiral Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein) arrives demanding tribute in the form of food to fill the bellies of his troops, Kora warns the community that this emissary of the tyrannical Regent Balisarius (Fra Fee) will take “everything” from them unless they fight. Because the farmers aren’t equipped to defend themselves, the burden of finding fighters willing to risk their lives falls upon Kora. She and Gunnar (Michiel Huisman), a nonviolent but pragmatic farmer, travel to a cantina in Mos Eisley — sorry, scratch that: I mean, they visit a seedy bar full of aliens in the port town of Providence where they meet Kai (Charlie Hunnam), a smuggler who can provide transportation on his stealthy spaceship.  Along the way, Kora and Gunnar recruit General Titus (Djimon Hounsou), a legendary but disgraced commander living on a world assembled from Ridley Scott’s “Gladiator” props and set dressings; Nemesis (Doona Bae), a master swordswoman who battles the love child of Shelob and the Borg Queen before joining the campaign; and Tarak (Staz Nair), a noble prince possessing Tarzan’s rapport with animals, who for some incomprehensible reason must ride a creature that looks like Buckbeak’s second cousin to gain his freedom. Snyder is cherry picking tropes and cinematic elements to fill in gaps in the narrative. “Rebel Moon — Part One: A Child of Fire” evokes, pays homage to, and draws inspiration from the work of Edgar Rice Burroughs, Tolkien, Pierre Christin, Robert A. Heinlein, and Poul Anderson; and from films such as Julie Taymor’s “Titus,” John Sturges’ “The Magnificent Seven,” and the original “Star Wars” trilogy.  Snyder’s primary influence must have been Akira Kurosawa’s “Seven Samurai,” which also shaped “The Magnificent Seven,” with Sturges altering the story’s setting to the old west. Snyder adapts it to fit the space opera mold — but he’s not the first to make that leap. In 1980, Roger Corman — in a blatant attempt to capitalize on the popularity of “Star Wars” — produced “Battle Beyond the Stars,” a film promoted as “‘Magnificent Seven’ in outer space.” Directed by Jimmy T. Murakami, this low-budget endeavor starred Richard Thomas as Shad, a young Akira farmer who enlists various mercenaries to save his people from Sador (John Saxon), leader of the very naughty Malmori raiders.  Snyder’s take is undeniably a superior film in terms of scope and production, with the director’s signature style making it visually appealing. But “Rebel Moon — Part One: A Child of Fire” suffers from a scarcity of characterization, emotion, and narrative subtleties. The script lacks nuance, genuine tension, warmth and humor. Snyder’s characters are tiresomely serious to the point of being tedious. It shouldn’t be this difficult to root for the reluctant hero Kora. It shouldn’t be this taxing riding along as she goes planet-hopping to round up her allies.  I should be able to take Skrein seriously as the fascist villain, but every time Atticus Noble is on screen, I keep seeing Rik Mayall's character Rick from “The Young Ones.” The two most promising characters in the film — JC1435, a sentient battle robot voiced by Anthony Hopkins; and Sam (Charlotte Maggi), a young woman from the farming settlement on Veldt — have limited screen time in the first installment of the saga. Maybe, there will be more story, better pacing, and expanded depth to the characters in Snyder’s extended cut. Maybe “Rebel Moon — Part Two: The Scargiver” will somehow improve the first installment. I hope that is the case, because Snyder is capable of making films that are both dazzling and entertaining. I honestly want to like this product. The characters have the potential to be interesting. Their cause is one that should resonate with the viewer. Their universe is filled with gorgeous alien planets and races that could be a prolific source of future storytelling. But Snyder needs to give the viewer some reason to empathize with the heroes, to cheer them on to victory, and to yearn to explore the uncharted worlds beyond the pages of the script.  Lee Clark Zumpe is entertainment editor at Tampa Bay Newspapers, a Tomatometer-Approved Critic, and an author of short fiction appearing in select anthologies and magazines.

"Dec 29, 2023",negative," A tedious slog through an avalanche of genre clichés, made worse by an air of pretentiousness and ponderous self-importance, Zack Snyder’s latest piece of Netflix bombast “Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire” spends over two hours of world-building to create a place no sane viewer would ever want to visit once, let alone the multiple times its subtitle suggests we’re meant to go back to it.  It’s an excruciating bore. The plot is supposedly an original creation of Snyder and co-writers Kurt Johnstad and Shay Hatten but actually a derivative hodgepodge of bits and pieces of other, better movies, with classics by Kurosawa and Lucas the main models.  It involves a growing rebellion against an evil empire by some of its oppressed people and the recruitment of members to join its ranks.  And after overloading us with laborious exposition, elephantine backstory and a repetitious sequence of episodes that are one-half ponderous talk and the other chaotic fights that often slip into slow-motion for presumed effect (and always conclude with a shot of the planet-hopping recruitment ship flying off for its next destination), it has the temerity to close with the observation that we’ve just witnessed “the beginning of something.”  One could only wish that it were the beginning of something else. Some of the narration is delivered in the instantly recognizable tones of Anthony Hopkins, who provides the voice of a robot named Jimmy, once a warrior but now ensconced on a moon called Veldt, where a bedraggled community of farmers led by Sindri (Corey Stoll, wearing a most unbecoming beard) ekes out a hand-to-mouth existence.  (Hopkins, fortunately for him, doesn’t actually have to appear in the movie.  Jimmy is played by Dustin Ceithamer, so Hopkins is basically doing a James Earl Jones thing.) Veldt is part of the empire, or Imperium, controlled by the Motherworld, which was once a monarchy whose King (Carey Elwes) and Queen (Rhian Rees) hoped that their angelic daughter Princess Issa (Stella Grace Fitzgerald) would usher in a new era of peace and harmony.  But, as we learn through narration and gauzy flashbacks, the royal family was assassinated, and power was seized by Belisarius (Fra Fee), a militaristic tyrant whose chief henchman Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein), dressed in quasi-Nazi garb, cruises about the galaxy in a huge Dreadnought, tasked with snuffing out any remnants of resistance to the new order.  One of his stops is Veldt, where he demands that the community provide grain for his crew.  When some protest that compliance would mean their own starvation, Noble responds with murder and a simple takeover of the place before departing. Naturally his action causes distress, and Kora (Sofia Boutella), an outsider who was taken in by the farmers when she crash landed on Veldt, becomes an instigator of resistance—it will later be revealed that she was an imperial warrior who turned against the regime, and thus a wanted fugitive.  She’s joined by handsome farmer Gunnar (Michiel Huisman), who’s besotted with her, and together they persuade Kai (Charlie Hunnam), a rogue pilot who for some reason speaks with an Irish brogue, to ferry them to other planets to seek out warriors to join in the protection of their moon. At this point the movie turns into a repetitive formula in which the three travel to some locale where they can approach a noteworthy prospect to join them; in each case Snyder structures the episode to begin with visuals attesting to the otherworldly character of the place (the production designers were Stephen Swain and Stefan Dechant, the costumer Stephanie Porter) and lots of surpassingly banal conversation before securing a “yes,” which is followed by a gigantic fight he tries to jazz up with bursts of super-speeded up action and slow-motion for “effect.”  By the time all the stopovers are complete, the intrepid trio have found a group of supposedly charismatic companions: Titus (Djimon Hounsou), a former imperial general now a drunken layabout; Nemesis (Doona Bae) a swordswoman whose weapons shoot out beams of light energy; Tarak (Staz Nair), an enslaved smithy who’s also an exceptional animal-whisperer; and Darrian Bloodaxe (Ray Fisher), whose moniker is descriptive of his talents.  By the close they’re all headed back for Veldt and, presumably a confrontation with Noble, who’s shown receiving a set of stern marching orders from his sneering master Belisarius. Snyder adds a plethora of genre piffle to amplify the plot; at one point, for example, Tarak takes flight aboard a weird winged creature that proves the writer-director knows his Harryhausen as well as Kurosawa and Lucas, and at another Jenna Malone camps it up as a ravenous alien spider-woman who does battle with Nemesis.  Such stuff only increases the nonsensicality of it all; the picture increasingly feels like a grab-bag of cheesy tropes, for the most part realized in mediocre CGI (the effects supervisors were Marcus Taormina and John “DJ” DesJadin) and shot in the same dark, murky style that Snyder brought to the series of DCU movies he oversaw and which, acting as his own cinematographer, he repeats here.  Editor Dody Dorn can do little to mitigate the monotony of the story and the visuals, and while Tom Holkenborg’s score ladles out music intended to inspire awe, it’s to no avail. Nor can the cast bring much zest to the sodden material, though they’re induced to pour a lot of energy into the attempt.  Boutella makes an athletic if inexpressive heroine, and Skrein’s sleazy villainy carries a certain campy charm, but the rest can’t invest their cardboard characters with any sort of inner life. "
"Dec 28, 2023",neutral," Zack Snyder’s Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire is a cumbersome, disjointed space version of A Bug’s Life that’s solely saved and made viewable because of its outstanding cast. While visually stunning and somewhat engaging enough to keep a viewer’s attention, the writing is all over the place, making it constantly questionable why we’re supposed to care. The dialogue is so clunky at times that even the deliveries coming from great actors feel forced in every way. Rebel Moon wants to be an epic with such intensity that it loses itself in an attempt to tell a compelling story. The CGI is acceptable; some of the creatures are genuinely riveting, as are the characters, but the pacing fumbles in its endeavor to take us through various sectors of different times and places. It’s obvious the film is meant to encompass one part of a story, but the arc doesn’t feel contained enough to leave a mark. There’s much to be desired, sure, but it’s hard to predict whether the second half will even manage to save it. There’s also something to be said about how the film could’ve fleshed out relationships more to make it additionally appealing in the grand scheme of storytelling. Part of the reason why Star Wars: A New Hope works so well despite the slow steadiness of its narrative approach is because the character dynamics it’s setting up are thoroughly engrossing from beginning to end. It’s hard to decipher who we’re meant to trust and what relationship we’re meant to invest in here. In no way, shape, or form does Rebel Moon Part One feel like it knows what it wants to be. However, it’s imperative to note that Sofia Boutella is an undeniable star. Kora is the most magnetic character in the story, and diving further into her past could have made the story even more inviting. Whatever we follow her through feels earned and thoughtfully crafted, which is also entirely due to Boutella’s performances. It’s clear as day that the actress is aware of her character’s heart and motives in a way that helps to bring the best to the surface. Michiel Huisman, Djimon Hounsou, Charlie Hunnam, and Stuart Martin also do an incredible job with the material they’re given. Quiet moments in the film result in some of the most vulnerable displays of humanity, but they’re so scarce that it’s not enough to save the narrative from falling apart. Whether the R-rated director’s cut makes a difference is hard to tell, but when a film is released with this many questions left in the air, you have to ask yourself what the purpose of it is anyway. Who’s running the show, leaving one version clunky while another could potentially shine, and who has the time and patience to commit to both? For a visually stunning film of this caliber, it’s unfortunate that the plot and characterizations don’t match the beauty. The third act is especially gorgeous, and the final few scenes leave off with the kind of space explosions that are always enjoyable to see for those of us who love the genre. Still, it’s not enough to make Rebel Moon Part One: A Child of Fire a film worth watching more than once or one that’ll be well remembered, either."
"Dec 28, 2023",neutral," Los 135 minutos de esta primera entrega (el 19 de abril llegará Rebel Moon (parte dos): La guerrera que deja marcas) muestran al director de El amanecer de los muertos (2004), 300 (2006), Watchmen: Los vigilantes (2009), Ga'hoole: La leyenda de los Guardianes (2010), Sucker Punch: Mundo surreal (2011), El hombre de acero (2013), Batman vs. Superman: El origen de la justicia (2016), Liga de la Justicia (2017) y El ejército de los muertos (2021) cumpliendo el viejo sueño de hacer “su” Star Wars gracias a los 166 millones de dólars aportados por Netflix."
"Dec 28, 2023",negative," Is there anything left to write about Zack Snyder? He is a polarising figure in film communities, although I am unsure if polarising is the right word. “Polarising” tends to refer to filmmakers who present challenging “love-it-or-hate-it” content, or who address controversial topics. In Snyder’s case, the vigorous and oftentimes angry debate is over whether or not his films are actually any good, or if he himself has a reasonable amount of talent. It is a debate that has raged throughout his directorial career. Personally I tend to sit on the fence. I liked his 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead, as I did his underrated Man of Steel trilogy of films (2013-21). On the other hand, his 300 (2007) and Watchmen (2009) adaptations left me cold, and I actively loathed his 2011 original Sucker Punch. My personal bottom line is that Snyder has a strong visual aesthetic that tends to over-use CGI and slow motion, that he is a deft hand at replicating other people’s imagery, but that he has no story sense whatsoever. This is a shame, because I get the very strong impression that Snyder would not agree. Rebel Moon is Snyder’s latest work, a much-hyped science fiction epic broken into two parts (the second comes next April). It sees an interplanetary military force arrive at a remote agrarian community and violently demand they hand over all of their harvest. With no way for the community to defend itself, a solo representative travels to the neighbouring planets in the search of soldiers and mercenaries who will come to their aid. If the premise sounds familiar, it is because it is: Akira Kurosawa filmed it in 1954 as Seven Samurai. Or perhaps you recognise it from John Sturges’ 1960 remake The Magnificent Seven. Or from John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton’s A Bug’s Life (1998), which liberally lifts from the original story as well. As does Dean Parisot’s Galaxy Quest (1999), Tsui Hark’s Seven Swords (2005), and – most pertinently – Jimmy T. Murakami’s sci-fi potboiler Battle Beyond the Stars (1980). Even Gareth Edwards’ 2016 Star Wars feature Rogue One cribs liberally from Kurosawa’s original playbook. The point is that for all of Netflix’s hyping of Rebel Moon as an exciting new space opera, it is actually based on pretty well-furrowed ground. This is not necessarily a bad thing: as all of the previous films mentioned have demonstrated, the execution of an old story is as much a key to success as the story itself. With enormous scope to remix and innovate, Snyder has instead gathered together a painfully obvious collection of- I hesitate to write ‘influences’, as that seems to give Snyder too much credit. ‘Things to photocopy and then mash together’ feels rather more appropriate. Star Wars is a very dominant influence, but it is also easy to see imagery cribbed from a wide range of anime productions, Korean cinema, and the popular wargame Warhammer 40,000. In most cases this assembled pastiche inspires a bored over-familiarity rather than any sense of remix or play. The film is generic pulp, which will likely find an undemanding audience but reeks of missed opportunities. It is also particularly unsubtle: its villain (played by Ed Skrein) does not simply resemble a Nazi like Star Wars‘ galactic empire, he is literally dressed as one. There is an oddly talented cast here, including Sofia Boutella, Charlie Hunnam, Djimon Hounsou, and Anthony Hopkins, but they are left hanging by a screenplay that does not provide them with any material to build upon. My advice? Watch Battle Beyond the Stars. At the time of writing it is streaming on Amazon Prime, it offers the same basic story, has its own talented cast including John Saxon, George Peppard, and Robert Vaughn, and never tries to pretend it is anything more than shameless pulp entertainment. It also provides a complete story with beginning, middle, and end – Rebel Moon demands you come back in four months for that. I imagine more than a few viewers will not bother."
"Dec 27, 2023",positive," Two months after the May 1980 release of The Empire Strikes Back in US cinemas, came a Seven Samurai/Magnificent Seven in Space knock-off that was out to capitalise on Empire's pull and which is most notable for the up-and-coming talents off-camera. It had a script by future Oscar nominee John Sayles, a score by Titanic Oscar winner James Horner, and special effects by a certain James Cameron. From little cosmic acorns grow... Battle Beyond the Stars doesn't loom large in anorak lore, but it does come to mind watching Netflix's Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire as 300 and Justice League director Zack Snyder repackages the Seven Samurai/Magnificent Seven narrative for a two-part space opera. The second instalment, The Scargiver, is due next April. This scene-setter sees a farming community on the planet Veldt terrorised by the army of the Mother World, who need the crops to feed the troops. Figuring it's better to die on your feet than live on your knees, mysterious villager Kora (Sofia Boutella) packs her bags and heads off to put together a bunch of hired guns/swords that can lead the farmers in fighting back. There's loads of melodrama here and Rebel Moon takes itself very seriously, but it will be no hardship for anyone with a thing for sci-fi action. Boutella is good in the set pieces, there's a decent supporting cast (Anthony Hopkins voices a robot, Charlie Hunnam's smuggler has, wait for it, a Belfast accent), and the nostalgia synapses will be firing goodo. Keep the movie reference bingo card handy. With a cliffhanger ending, Snyder has nicely set up part two, describing it as ""a war movie"". Chances are, you'll be pitching up on Veldt again next April. © RTÉ 2024. RTÉ.ie is the website of Raidió Teilifís Éireann, Ireland's National Public Service Media.

"Dec 27, 2023",negative," En los confines distantes de la galaxia, una apacible colonia enfrenta la amenaza de un poder tiránico, desencadenando una lucha desesperada por la supervivencia. En este contexto, emerge la enigmática Kora como la última esperanza, convocando a un ecléctico grupo de individuos dispuestos a desafiar el destino. Entre forasteros, insurgentes, campesinos y huérfanos de guerra, se forja un nuevo ejército de héroes dispuestos a enfrentar el desafío que se avecina.  Lo que podría haber sido un digno ""fanfiction"" de Star Wars se convierte en una experiencia desalentadora. La falta de originalidad en el diseño de situaciones, junto con un tema demasiado básico, socava cualquier intento de la película por destacar en el género de la ciencia ficción. Los personajes, apenas esbozados, carecen de la profundidad necesaria para conectar, y sus motivaciones son tan difusas como las estrellas en la galaxia. A medida que la trama se desenvuelve, los personajes, con la heroína principal encarnada por la sutil Sofia Boutella a la cabeza, se ven inmersos en situaciones que carecen por completo de profundidad. Sus interacciones se limitan a diálogos simplistas, inverosímiles, despojados de la riqueza emocional y los matices que podrían haber dado vida a sus personalidades. La principal deficiencia de Rebel Moon Parte 1: La niña del fuego reside en su equivocada suposición de que los espectadores estarán dispuestos a aguardar la siguiente entrega para alcanzar una comprensión completa de la trama. Aunque la película se introduce como una mera porción de un relato más extenso, esta elección estratégica revela un desacierto fundamental. La expectativa de postergar la revelación integral de la narrativa se traduce en una desconexión potencial, socavando así la coherencia y el impacto de la obra en su conjunto. Rebel Moon Parte 1: La niña del fuego, que ofrece un boceto en lugar de una historia auténtica y profunda, es sin duda la peor película de Zack Snyder hasta la fecha, una decepción intergaláctica para aquellos que esperaban algo más de esta incursión en el vasto espacio sideral."
"Dec 27, 2023",positive," Ya sabemos lo que pasa cuando Zack Snyder juega con sus propias reglas. Lo mostró en Sucker Punch, su película más polémica -y eso que el cineasta, haga lo que haga, siempre termina siéndolo-. Ahora, después de estar unos cuatro años adaptando historias a la gran pantalla con un canon ajeno, el cineasta vuelve a construir un mundo propio con Rebel Moon - Parte Uno: La niña del fuego.  Tras cortar relaciones con Warner Bros. -parece que no de muy buena forma-, Snyder ha encontrado una nueva casa en Netflix y se nota que la plataforma de 'streaming' le está dando la libertad que no le han dado nunca. Ya ocurrió con Ejército de los muertos, una secuela espiritual de su debut como director Amanecer de los muertos. Pero es que con Rebel Moon está totalmente desatado.  En esta épica de ciencia ficción, Snyder nos presenta a Kora (Sofia Boutella), una mujer con un misterioso pasado que vive en un planeta dedicado a la agricultura y situado en los confines de la galaxia. Cuando el tirano Balisarius (Fra Free) envía a su mano derecha, el almirante Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein), hasta allí, Kora sabe que la única forma de salvar a sus comunidad y al resto de la galaxia es reclutar a guerreros que estén dispuestos a luchar contra la tiranía. Secuencias de lucha y acción a cámara lentísima, imágenes grandilocuentes, segmentos conectados en ocasiones sin demasiada coherencia, personajes excesivamente subidos de drama y una estética que mezcla wéstern, 'steampunk' y lo oriental. Rebel Moon tiene de todo lo que se crítica a Snyder, pero eso no quita para que el resultado final sea un producto tremendamente entretenido.  La primera entrega -la secuela Parte Dos: La guerrera que deja marcas llega en abril- es todo lo que puedes esperar de una película de Snyder: es espectacular, épica y, si entras en ella, te lo vas a pasar en grande. El único problema es que da la sensación de que al cineasta se ha quedado corto en tiempo y el filme solo rasca la superficie de un mundo gigantesco que puede dar mucho de sí. "
"Dec 27, 2023",negative,"Snyder has created possibly the worst movie of his career, which is edited to pieces, filled with bland characters, horrendous visuals, and an oh-so-familiar story that leaves little interest in the upcoming future installment and inevitable extended cut."
"Dec 27, 2023",positive," La sociedad de Zack Snyder y Netflix no empezaba con buen pie con ‘El ejército de los muertos’, casi un testamento, zombies de por medio, de por qué el director no había hecho más que devaluar su poder narrativo desde la que es aún hoy su mejor película, ‘Amanecer de los muertos’. Algo que sorprende al comprobar que 'Rebel Moon Parte 1: La niña del fuego' es su película más consistente desde hace más de una década, lo que resulta paradójico al ser otra propuesta de Netflix. Esta afirmación responde a que muchas veces hemos comprobado que los grandes directores tienden a entregar sus películas más mediocres cuando están dentro de los confines de libertad sin límites que les ofrece la gran plataforma. Incluso en ‘El Irlandés’ de Martin Scorsese se llegaba a notar en sus tres horas y media. Los Coen hicieron un capricho irregular y no tan gracioso como pensaban, Wes Anderson no ha dejado huella, Duncan Jones se cargó su carrera allí. Parece que muchos autores tropiezan en su paso a la plataforma, era de esperar que Snyder fuera todavía a peor. Pero el caso es más bien al revés, la carta blanca de 166 millones al director resulta aquí un bálsamo por dos motivos concretos. No tiene un lastre de justificar sus decisiones visuales para deificar figuras de la cultura pop previas, con lo que nos ahorra el mal rato de sus justificaciones para encajar historias y humor sin gracia en su revisionismo de DC, por otra, su confianza en su propia pericia estética logra aquí cotas inalcanzables gracias a la falta de barreras absurdas. Su madurez es más o menos equiparable al delirio absoluto. La sorpresa es que en este caso su disciplina iconoclasta se encuentra con formas de arte que van más allá del cine, pero nadie quiere, busca, o le obliga a justificarlo, por lo que de alguna manera acaba siendo algo más radical y vanguardista, pese a que el motor de esa fuerza creadora provenga de la misma simiente de un merluzo borracho de anabolizante y videojuegos. La realidad es que quizá por accidente se haya liberado su voz más pura y que realmente sea más inofensiva y bella de lo que habíamos calibrado quienes despreciamos su ‘Snyder Cut’. Lo gracioso es que la operación nos dejará su visión completa en la plataforma en febrero, pero mientras tanto, el resultado del experimento es un divertido pastiche pop de Space Opera y fantasía épica ochentera que encaja como un guante en el estilo impresionista del Snyder, es decir puro espectáculo visual, impecable en cada decisión técnica, que además de dejar la boca abierta en ocasiones, deja con ganas de Parte 2, que seguramente doble la apuesta hasta límites que solo pueden caer o bien en lo chabacano o la genialidad. Y es que viendo ‘Rebel Moon parte I’ es fácil darse cuenta de que a estas alturas, los guiones del cine de Snyder no van a mejorar. Por supuesto que aquí no es el caso, pero al menos en está ocasión la juguetería del director, con esa forma de ir mostrando personajes como si fuera un niño presentándonos a los distintos modelos de los Másters del Universo que le han traído los reyes, a cada cuál más vigoréxico, tiene una coherencia temática y estética que funciona solo dentro de su mundo. Sí, también tiene un hilo simple del que no se sale en más de dos horas, sin derrapes fuera del tiesto, sin bromas y humor forzados que no encaja, y se compromete con su visión con precisión. Claro que acusa el síndrome de meter ""todo lo que le gusta"" a Snyder sin mayor criterio que la macedonia, pero la forma de ir introduciendo nuevas escenas responde a una especie de intentona de elipsis que ya es capaz de mejorar el pasapantallas con filtro rapie de pajillero gamer de  ‘Sucker Punch’, donde la idea era ir visitando diferentes escenarios para escenas de acción. Pero si en aquella la excusa no colaba, aquí las visitas a los planetas justifican una variedad de influencias que van del Cyber Punk al spaguetti western, al resampleo de las culturas clásicas. Mezclar ‘Dune’, el chambara, ‘Star Wars’ y la violencia y estética militarista no es totalmente original, y en ese aspecto ‘Rebel Moon’ no es tan distinta a lo delirios de cómic y excesos de blockbusters pulp de los últimos años como ‘Las crónicas de Riddick’ (2004) o ‘Júpiter Ascending’ (2015), la diferencia es que el mimo de cada composición, el brutal uso del anamórfico y la excelencia de los efectos especiales justifican la piñata de referencias, que tienen la saga de George Lucas como punto de partida, pero también como punto de fuga final. No por casualidad, se ha comparado ‘Rebel Moon’ con ‘Los siete magníficos’, ya que junta batallas galácticas y la versión Western de Kurosawa como lo hacía ya una premisa de un rip-off de la película de George Lucas producido por Roger Corman en 1980, ‘Los siete magníficos del espacio’, que no es la única con la que comparte espíritu, sino que hay detalles que incluso podrían coincidir con ‘Star Crash, choque de galaxias’ (1978). Porque la película se desata y parece estar más cómoda en los universos visuales de aventuras galácticas aparecidas a partir del éxito galáctico, en especial sintonía con la ‘Flash Gordon’ de 1980 y su vestuario sobrecargado, chillón y grandilocuente por el simple hecho de serlo. Aunque estuviera pensada como una película de ‘Star Wars’, la producción de Netflix se deja incluso llevar por los grandes cómics de bárbaros y la moda que dio tantas copias también de Conan, dejando aquí algunos momentos y personajes que no desentonarían en ‘El señor de las bestias’ (1982), como ese musculoso que doma a un grifo con toda su musculatura en tensión, bien embadurnada, en una de las escenas de acción más plásticas y vigorosas que se han visto este año. No debería soprender a nadie la pleitesía al poderío de estos personajes y seres de fantasía  que habitan espacios con una dirección artística que recuerda a las películas de fantasía oscura barrocas como ‘Krull’ (1983), quizá tan imcomprendida como esta, las láminas de Frank Frazetta, el universo de forzudos semidesnudos del ‘Den’ de Richard Corben y en general una inspiración en las portadas a todo color de Metal Hurlant, en las que la sensualidad omnipresente, típica de desplegable de revista para adultos, no estaba reñida con la ciencia ficción basada en autores de cierto prestigio. Aunque en ese mejunje destaca el origen en el terror de Snyder, que sigue dejando huella en sus películas, y ‘Rebel Moon’ tiene un buen surtido de criaturas y viscosidades, con una mujer araña que recuerda a las de ‘Kamen Rider ZO’ (1993) o ‘Spookies’ (1986) y una combinación de CGI y buenas prótesis que se echan en falta en otras space opera recientes. El surtido es inabarcable y es prácticamente seguro que se amplíe y extienda en el futuro, pero el punto de partida deja la idea de que Snyder realmente ha encontrado su gran proyecto épico de larga duración. Es cierto que su reticencia a guiones bien escritos, personajes con definición y cohesión de principio a fin diluyen el poder de impacto de un cine desde la entraña misma de la fascinación, pero en ‘Rebel Moon’ Zack Snyder ahuyenta a los fantasmas del exceso y se reboza en su creatividad óptica más intrépida, o insensata, y con ello consigue que su tesis aterrize en un lugar en el que la imagen en movimiento puede ser suficiente para mover emociones, revirtiendo su filia a la horterada MTV de los 2000 a una facultad renacentista que quizá complete en un fresco de dos largometrajes de los que inspiraban el cómic europeo de antaño."
"Dec 26, 2023",negative," No matter how much snow or how many elves you have to offer, what most people really want from a film at Christmas is blockbuster action. We know this from box office and streamer stats, and it’s backed up by basic psychology. The year is coming to a close. We’ve worked hard and experienced a fair bit of stress. It’s cold, daylight is at a premium and many of us are keeping company with family member who, for all that we might love them, definitely get on our nerves. Of course we want to see something explode. Zack Snyder understands that. In this, part one of a hoped-for new saga (with filming on part two already underway), he takes all the classic elements of the science fiction or fantasy action spectacular and condenses them for our viewing pleasure. The result is a ridiculous mess, but it may nonetheless be just what you need. It reminded this reviewer, more than anything, of 1980 schlock classic Battle Beyond The Stars, itself a sci-fi takes on The Magnificent Seven (which was, of course, based on Akira Kurosawa’s magnificent Seven Samurai). Snyder knows how to deliver space opera by numbers and twee as it is, the amount of clichés that he manages to pack into a single film is impressive. It’s a film which deserves to be watched in a group and enthusiastically heckled, with a bit of popcorn-throwing to add to the fun. The dialogue is, or course, uniformly terrible. “The very idea of love and family was beaten out of me,” says heroine Kora (Sofia Boutella) at the start, letting us know what we’re in for. She’s a former outlaw (and, it turns out, a lot of other things) hiding out in a galactic backwater with a group of subsistence-farming Vikings (don’t ask). She wants to stop running, find a peaceful home, and all the rest of it, but those hopes are thwarted when a large spaceship known as a Dreadnaught suddenly lands there are a troupe of space Nazis strolls out of it (the uniforms have been adapted a bit, the hats less so). They want pretty much all the grain the place can produce, which would leave the locals to starve. kora insists it’s not her problem, but changes her mind when a local girl is (with extreme gratuitousness, but hey, Snyder managed a whole 28 minutes before going there this time) threatened with rape. A spectacularly silly fight sequence follows, and after that Kora basically has no choice but to set out to lead a rebellion against the all-powerful bad guys before they find and kill her and everyone she’s ever known. Accompanying her is ordinary farm boy Gunnar. In the absence of any available Chris, he’s played by Michiel Huisman, who does his best impression of a Chris. Most of the rest of the film concerns their efforts to build an army. This starts with Kai (Charlie Hunnam), a scruffy looking pilot who describes himself as “a bit of an opportunist”. They go on to acquire Tarak (Staz Nair), a long-haired muscular slave guy with a secret past who intuitively understands animals, Beastmaster-style, and who never deigns to put on any more clothes no matter where they go. Next up is Nemesis (Bae Doona, who, in the absence of lines, does her best to make her presence felt by glowering). She’s a sword-wielding warrior with a strict honour code and a thirst for revenge, who sometimes uses thinly disguised lightsabers instead. Just in case you thought that was enough of a stereotype, we also get Bloodaxe (Ray Fisher), a Black revolutionary with dreadlocks and heavy forehead make-up (perhaps inspired by Furiosa), who fights with a spear. Finally, there’s Titus (Djimon Hounsou), a disgraced former general whose feelings of guilt about the deaths of his men have driven him to alcoholism. Oh, and there’s some lassie with woad on her face, apropos of nothing. Although you’d think these ‘characters’ didn’t need much building, Snyder spends a fair bit of time on it, and that’s not such a bad thing, because it means that we get to see Nemesis fight a giant spider monster (which is really bad at fighting back, like many a Snyder bad guy, but it’s still fun). Tarak bonds with an utterly adorable giant raven/griffin thingy which, despite the CGI, has something of the charm of an old stop-motion Harryhausen creation. There’s a lot of great creature design, especially in the background, where one imagines that the effects team were more at liberty to play. Ed Skrein’s lead bad guy spends his private time getting intimate with a tentacle monster, and the abundance of such details helps to give the various worlds a lived-in feel, despite the shallowness of the actual plot. Parts of it are in poor taste. That initial attempted rape is not the only incidence of sexual violence, and for all that Snyder thinks he’s being clever by turning things round, with his heroine coming to the rescue, there’s a nastiness about it which sits awkwardly in what is otherwise quite an amiable little adventure movie. Likewise, the little lectures about the need for everybody to be more cynical and pre-emptively violent are as out of place as they are philosophically vapid. The film is at its best when not pretending to be clever. There’s a lot of fighting, involving numerous ridiculous stunts, and though it’s not particularly well shot, it keeps things pacey. There are glamorous costumes and shiny weapons. There are explosions which are both orange and teal at the same time. A large budget was no doubt splurged on this, but in essence it’s a great little B-movie, and if you go into it expecting that, you won’t be too disappointed."
"Dec 26, 2023",positive,"Getting right down to it. It is entertaining. An entertaining mess with a bevy of problems in the character department, but still somewhat fun. "
"Dec 26, 2023",neutral,"As a fan of Zack Snyder, Star Wars, and space fantasy, I wanted to love this film.  But it's simply not good enough in its current form. There's some inspired moments, but the story and script are devoid of any creativity."
"Dec 26, 2023",neutral," So we are back! Time to catch up on some more recent movie reviews. I forgot to share my Best of the Year video in my last post but don’t miss it! I honestly put off seeing this movie because it seemed very pretentious but when I actually went to see it it was actually quite accessible and engrossing. In fact, it almost made my best of the year video but was a strong honorable mention. Basically Anatomy of a Fall is a compelling crime courtroom drama where we are asked to question if a woman killed her husband or is it the accident she claims. The movie keeps you guessing to the end as it layers clues through court testimony and flashbacks. It’s the kind of movie multiple people could watch and have different opinions about. Sandra Hüller is excellent (and very good in Zone of Interest that I reviewed in the last post) as the main protagonist as is Milo Machado Graner as her son Daniel. It’s the kind of movie Hollywood would ruin with poorly staged melodrama instead of trusting the audience with ambiguities and flawed characters. It is an R rating but I think a lot of people would be entertained by this film. It’s not the arthouse niche film I thought it was at first. As a lover of anime I am always looking for ways to introduce friends to the artform in accessible and engrossing ways. The First Slam Dunk is such a film and one of my favorite films of 2023. It’s a simple movie that tells us the story of a high school basketball team that’s trying to compete and manage the stresses of their personal lives. As we get to know the players on and off the court director Takehiko Inoue does a great job of building the importance of the big game and even the big shot so we are waiting with baited breath to see what will happen. The game scenes are so well done my only regret is having to watch it at home and not on the big screen (it was only at my theater for one weekend and I missed it which I bitterly regret.) Even so what a compelling film that almost anyone will enjoy. My only flaw with it is I think the character designs look like professional athletes rather than high school students. I guess that’s the way the manga is but it did take me out of the story a couple of times. Still, I highly recommend The First Slam Dunk. I am not a wrestling fan but my friend Ryan Cam is and he had prepared me for this upcoming film The Iron Claw and the intense tale it is telling. I know people hate spoilers but this is a film where I do think knowing what you are getting into is a good idea particularly with how triggering it could be for some individuals (2 characters commit suicide.) The crazy thing is in real life there was another brother in the Von Erich family that committed suicide that they left out! I have rarely been more angry at a character than I was at the father played by Holt McCallany in this film. You think about all the people who would do anything for a child and then to see the way this man manipulates and abuses his children it’s infuriating. The only thing he cared about was wrestling not the humans he was entrusted with. Zac Efron is excellent as one of the brothers Kevin as is Jeremy Allen White as Kerry. It’s a tough sit but extremely moving and I do recommend it if only for the incredible performances. I really disliked the first trailer for Migration because it felt like another middling entry from Illumination. After being disappointed by their The Super Mario Bros Movie earlier this year my hopes weren’t high for this bird movie but then the trailers started to get better and with director Benjamin Renner at the helm I had more confidence and that optimism was not in vain! This is probably my favorite film from Illumination and ended up being a very enjoyable family film. The story is pretty basic with the road trip and the neurotic parent scared to leave the nest but the script by Mike White is funny and the voice acting is all well done. The only thing I would change is we didn’t really need the over-the-top chef villain. He’s fine for the restaurant scene but didn’t need to stay throughout the film. There’s enough drama going on with the journey we didn’t need a supervillain complicating things. But this is an entertaining, funny, well-written adventure the whole family will love. I actually hadn’t watched Robot Dreams when my colleagues at UFCA nominated it for best animated film. I’m the animation girl so I was a little embarrassed they selected something I hadn’t seen so I immediately watched my screener dvd for it and am so glad they selected it! What a delightful animated film. It instantly went up my list of the best movies of 2023. I’m so sad that not many have seen this film because it is so charming. It’s a simple story of a dog that makes a robot to be his best friend and the amazing summer they have together. I love the hand drawn animation by Pablo Berger and the way the movie uses music is so endearing. It might be my favorite use of “September” by Earth Wind & Fire ever in a movie. This movie is joy in movie form and I adored it. Keep an eye out for it if you can see it in a theater or on streaming. I actually wasn’t a big fan of 2017’s Loving Vincent. While the visual style of using Van Gogh’s paintings to make an animated film was impressive the story was not captivating for a feature film. If you loved that film I am not sure what you will think of the team’s follow-up The Peasants but it also wasn’t for me. While the visual style is unique it feels slicker and less arresting than Loving Vincent and the story here is so relentlessly bleak it was hard to watch. This is an animated film for adults where a young teen begins an affair with a married man and ends up marrying his father and things get expectedly messy with rape and assault involved throughout the picture. It’s very depressing without the moving moments of something depressing like The Iron Claw. I just really didn’t enjoy it despite the impressive visual achievement. It’s no secret to anyone who follows movies that director Zack Snyder can be very divisive in his films. He has a huge hive that devotedly follows everything he does and then a large group that can’t stand most of his work. He’s normally not my favorite but I do like some films like his most recent Zack Snyder’s Justice League. Now he is releasing a new sci-fi epic that was evidently originally pitched to Lucasfilm as a Star Wars film but was not accepted and sent over to Netlflix. I was able to see it on the big screen and left confused by what Snyder had put together. For an epic sci-fi film it was surprisingly small in feel for most of the movie. A lot of the first half is spent on a farming planet and people confronted with a Nazi type character played by Ed Skrein and what they are going to do about it. Then Sofia Boutella’s Kora goes out into space to try and find warriors ala The Magnificent Seven and Seven Samurai but in space. The second half does get more epic in feel but it’s still arrive at a planet, talk to people and maybe have a little bit of action. Small when I expected big. I guess Snyder has an entirely different cut of the movie which is very annoying especially when a film has a limited theatrical so it doesn’t need to be PG-13. It feels like a phony attempt to create a ‘Snyder Cut’ movement where none needed to occur. Still, the movie is fine if you like sci-fi but nothing special. It’s not offensively bad. Just forgettable. I’d rather just watch Star Wars even though that franchise has been pretty bad lately. At least it has occasional characters and places I care about. This is bland and left me pretty meh for part 2, which I think says a lot. I would like to put in a longer review of The Boy and the Heron particularly when I get the chance to see it again when I am more rested. I actually saw it opening night at a midnight screening so I was pretty tired and did struggle to stay awake throughout the entire movie. Still, it’s definitely an impressive visual achievement full of imagination and creativity. The type of film only Miyazaki could come up with. I also loved the music by Joe Hisaishi and I hope the Academy will finally recognize his genius with a nomination. The story was a lot and kind of all over the place but it left me intrigued to see it again and study its themes. It also has a lot of weird birds which aren’t exactly my favorite! Still, I have a feeling it’s a movie that will grow on me the more I see it and it’s always a treat to see a Miyazaki film in the theaters. More please! Obviously I’m a big fan of rom-coms and for the most part this year has been a really good year for the genre both on the big and small screen, so I was excited for Anyone But You. An R rated modern take on Much Ado About Nothing seemed like just my thing, but I came away thinking it was just ok.  The parts where it leans into the Shakespeare play work the best and Glen Powell is so good as your romantic lead. Unfortunately Sydney Sweeney felt very wooden and that impacted the chemistry between the two. The physical comedy didn’t really work and the supporting cast is mostly wasted. Fans of the genre will enjoy it but it just could have been so much better. Lately I have been enjoying Indian action cinema a lot more than what Hollywood is providing. They have a spectacle and excitement you don’t get in many American films these days. This is why I jumped at the chance to see the new film from Prashanth Neel starring Prabhas called Salaar: Part 1- Ceasefire. It’s a mouthful of a title and a whole lot of movie to match but it mostly was a big bombastic fun time at the cinema. Prabhas is such a titan in these roles and the action is visceral and extremely bloody (if you are squeamish about blood don’t see this one!) It does get confusing and the subtitles felt very fast but overall I enjoyed the experience of this crazy wild film. I do wish it had dance and music like other Indian cinema I’ve seen like RRR and the  Baahubali films but this is enjoyable as well. So there you have it! I did it! That’s all the movies I’ve seen in the last few weeks! Merry Christmas to you and thank you for supporting my career and everything I do. "
"Dec 25, 2023",neutral,"With a decent villain portrayed by Ed Skrein, fascinating visuals by Snyder, and the promise of an impressive saga, Rebel Moon is a safe start to a potential new space opera."
"Dec 25, 2023",positive," First things first, I did not hate Rebel Moon Part 1: A Child Of Fire. I didn’t love it, I didn’t hate it. I came away from the movie with mixed feelings. Then again, I have mixed feelings about the first Star Wars, which I do love, but which is undeniably a rough draft of what George Lucas and his collaborators eventually came up with across the original trilogy. Rebel Moon is not a trilogy, and that’s my first complaint. I am not a fan of these two-part movies. A movie should be one film or three films. Two is an awkward number, especially for what is obviously intended to be a major space opera epic. Too much and too little were attempted and achieved in Part 1. The pacing is a mess. It moves too slowly much of the time, yet the story—the important pieces like character development—are rushed through and glossed over. My second complaint is that so much of the movie makes so little sense. Yes, I can understand how a giant space empire needs food to feed its soldiers. No, I can’t see how a group of five or six warriors (even supplemented with three or four squads of rebel fighters) will be able to fight off a massive dreadnought ship and its battalions of well-armed troops. I liked the twist and the betrayal toward the end of the movie, but I thought the means by which our heroes escape quite preposterous. Who designed those scorpion chair robots? They’re very cool but...why would you make the paralyzing device the same as the key? And how would the farmer, Gunnar, know that? It would have made more sense for Kai to be playing a deeper, twistier game here. Rebel Moon Part 1 functions like the beginning of Seven Samurai or The Magnificent Seven or, well, The Three Amigos. A village comes under threat by a powerful enemy and a group of rough-around-the-edges heroes are gathered to help the villagers fight back. The problem here is scale. If Snyder had made the enemy a group of space pirates or some kind of evil space biker gang or something, fine. Even just a local officer manning this planet who cracks down to forcefully. But we’re talking about a massive, multi-star-system force that’s conquered known space and is willing to throw all its might at these villagers. I don’t buy it. The actual gathering of the heroes is also poorly paced. We get a massively extended scene of Tarak breaking and then riding a space griffon (with lots of Snyder slo-mo to slow things down further) torn straight out of the Harry Potter hippogriff scenes, but then when they find General Titus (a slovenly drunk now, but still ripped) it’s one motivational speech and off we go. Rebel Moon is basically PG-13 Star Wars in a lot of ways—you won’t hear that kind of language in a galaxy far, far away or have scenes with attempted sexual assault—but it’s never as charming or funny. The characters aren’t terrible, but the most likeable among them ends up being a bad guy. There’s not nearly enough comic relief, which directors like Snyder seem to never realize helps us care and bond with characters so that we care more when bad things happen to them. Comic relief helps create tension! I could go on and on about all the little things that didn’t make sense in this movie, but the long and short of it is simple: With a little more time and a stronger script, this could have been a tremendous space opera. Instead, it was merely enjoyable. I didn’t find it half so terrible as the reviews made it sound. All the “worst movies ever!” talk seems rather over-the-top and breathless to me. In fact, I’d say I like this more than any of Snyder’s films since the old days of 300, Watchmen and The Dawn Of The Dead. Sure, it’s derivative. So is Star Wars. I’m fine with derivative works, especially in the sword-and-planet genre. John Carter was around long before Dune. I don’t begrudge Frank Herbert for riffing off of Edgar Rice Burroughs, or George Lucas riffing off of Herbert and Akira Kurosawa, or Zack Snyder riffing off all of the above. I’ve had my own ideas for sword-and-planet-and-samurai stories. We’re all influenced by a million things. The problem with Rebel Moon is that it doesn’t do enough to establish itself as something unique and coherent. Maybe that will change when we have Part 2, but I wish Snyder had come up with some better hooks, some more obvious ways to make this universe special and distinct rather than just a hodge-podge of other people’s ideas. And yet, at the same time, it felt mostly very capable as a somewhat darker, edgier Star Wars, wooden characters and flimsy plot aside. I enjoyed the action and was mostly entertained throughout. If anything, it suffered from many of the same problems the sequel trilogy suffered from, which were often pacing issues. Recall, the original Star Wars trilogy did such a great job at two things: First, it gave us great characters we cared about; second, it spent meaningful time establishing a sense of place in each of its films. We got to know planets like Tatooine, Dagobah, Hoth, the moon of Endor, the Death Star, Cloud City and so forth. In the sequel trilogy and in Rebel Moon, the places we go are barely established at all and utterly forgettable. The characters have potential, but we hardly scratch the surface. Still, I like them for the most part. I like Sofia Boutella’s Kora (I almost titled this review, The Legend Of Kora) though I wish Snyder had picked better ways to reveal her past to us than long exposition-laden flashbacks. Charlie Hunnam’s Kai was a lot of fun, though he—like all the others—gets a little lost in the mix of introducing so many characters in so short a span. The robot, Jimmy, is an instant favorite thanks to the wonderful voice work from Anthony Hopkins. More Jimmy, please. Djimon Hounsou’s General Titus didn’t get enough screentime at all (perhaps half of these characters should have been introduced in the second movie in the fictional trilogy I wish this was) and Michiel Huisman’s Gunnar and Bae Doona’s sword-wielding Nemesis, not to mention the surprisingly sympathetic spider-monster-lady she fights. Meanwhile, the special effects, sound design, costumes and cinematography were all top-notch. I really liked this film’s take on laser blasters, which pop holes right through people. Nemesis’s swords aren’t quite lightsabers, though they looked like that in the trailer. Rather, they’re normal swords that heat up into glowing fire-blades. I just wish that all this attention to detail had been given a little more room to breathe—which is a sentiment I hold toward the characters and the dialogue as well. I suppose much of my enjoyment here is probably due to the exceptionally low expectations I came into the movie with. I was fully expecting it to be dreadful at every turn, but it was more like a fast food cheeseburger. Not bad, really, just nothing particularly unique and not the type of burger you’d get on a date. I enjoy a fast food burger from time to time, though. It can really hit the spot! Rebel Moon scratched that space opera itch I always have in the same way John Carter did when that movie came out and bombed with critics and audiences, and it did it without the Force. It’s no Andor, by any means, but it’s really no worse than the Star Wars sequel trilogy and I enjoyed it more than the prequels. At least there’s no Jar Jar Binks. I’m definitely going to watch Part 2 and I’m genuinely curious to see what happens. I’ll probably even watch the director’s cut when that comes out (though it should have just been that version from the start for goodness sakes!) which is something I didn’t have the stomach for with The Justice League.  Score: 3/5 — Rebel Moon is an entertaining but flawed space opera with some great action and cinematography that would have been better as the first part of an R-rated trilogy. Hopefully Part 2 builds on the opening film’s strengths. I would not complain if this became a larger franchise with more room to grow the universe and shape into something more unique."
"Dec 24, 2023",negative,"There isn't enough slow-motion in the world to make up for the copy/paste narrative, lame characters, awful pacing and miserable final act. What a waste of time."
"Dec 24, 2023",negative,"Snyder die hards might end up loving it, but “Rebel Moon” is boiler plate scifi slop that just doesn’t make an impression at all."
"Dec 24, 2023",negative," The first part of Zack Snyder’s ambitious, long-cherished space opera, Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire looks suitably impressive: the story unfolds against vividly realised worlds, starting in an idealistic agrarian commune on an out-of-the-way moon, and travelling through cobalt mining planets, gritty desert outposts and lunar dive bars. The fight sequences are decent, if a little over-reliant on self-important slow-motion shots of people clobbering one another with space axes. But the story is a derivative mess that feels as though it was assembled from bits of plot picked off the carcasses of other, better films, and glued together with brain-numbing, pace-killing chunks of exposition. Sofia Boutella shows action-star potential as Kora, a mysterious outsider who has found peace living with the farming commune, but she deserves a better vehicle than this chop-shopped jalopy."
"Dec 24, 2023",positive,"Rebel Moon: Part One - A Child of Fire isn't terrible, but it is derivative of so many other sci-fi and fantasy films. "
"Dec 24, 2023",negative," The Zach Snyder mythos grows larger every day. The director became a polarizing figure in his DC films era, but his ability to create indelible images never wavered. Since his 2004 The Dawn of the Dead, Snyder could elevate his projects with vivid imagery. Yet some of his stories have fallen short of his potential. Sadly, Rebel Moon – Part One continues that trend. Despite some genuinely jaw-dropping moments, thin characters and overused tropes sink what might have been Snyder’s triumph as a filmmaker.  Snyder’s latest follows Kora (Sofia Boutella) – a woman hiding from the galaxy in a small farming village. However, her past resurfaces when an imperialistic force – known as the Motherworld – arrives. With the help of local Gunnar (Michael Huisman), Kora begins to collect a group of warriors to fight the Motherworld. Soon, Titus (Djimon Hounsou), Kai (Charlie Hunnam), Tarak (Staz Nair), Nemesis (Doona Bae), and Darrian Bloodaxe (Ray Fisher) make up her elite team. However, Regent Balisarius (Fra Free) and Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein) hunt the crew to stop their growing cause.  On its face, Rebel Moon joins a long tradition of films nodding to past cinematic achievements. Star Wars once drew from Flash Gordon. The Knives Out series pulls from Agatha Christie stories. Even Indiana Jones pulls from old serial films. However, each of these stories found unique twists and turns based on the tropes these genres created. Like playing an arrangement of a musical piece, the flourishes of the individual musician help sell the unique experience. Sadly, Snyder plays into these tropes, rather than finding his own tune.  The character shells quickly make Rebel Moon overly predictable. Snyder plays into these moments as shorthand yet overloads the film with exposition. Strangely, Rebel Moon suffers from having too many tropes, while simultaneously crafting lore that many will find challenging to follow. While this could mean the feature has impressive world-building, the lack of ambition in the storytelling undercuts the franchise’s potential future. Not a single thing a character does in this film will surprise you either.  Synder certainly provides plenty of hero moments to each character, but he also zaps any tension from these moments. Again, the overly predictable nature of each character removes all dramatic tension from any moments that could make for interesting battles. This, combined with costuming that tells us exactly which “type” of character we’re interacting with, leaves little for the audience to discover. Without personal moments where we fear for our heroes, we simply lose interest. Even when one character acts selflessly, the sequence borders on comedy. It’s as if Zach Snyder is allergic to sentimentality despite telling an underdog story. This may ultimately doom his franchise.  Watching Rebel Moon was less of a chore than one might expect. Yet at the same time, that does make it a good movie. Much of the humor, comes unintentionally (a particularly yonic and phallic opening to the movie-inspired laughter from this critic and throughout the theater). The CG creates some spectacular moments, but the lack of emotion within the story turns Rebel Moon Part One into a checklist of a movie. As we assemble the crew, in order, the rhythm and purpose of Snyder’s latest dwindles. With a second part coming in early 2024, and a director’s cut already promised, perhaps Snyder can salvage his original franchise. "
"Dec 24, 2023",negative," If there were FYC screeners for the Razzie Awards, I'm quite confident I'd have received one for Zack Snyder's Rebel Moon: Part One - A Child of Fire along with the usual hardbound picture book, a t-shirt that doesn't fit, a moon-shaped stress ball, and a coupon for 10% off admission to Rebel Moon: Part Two - The Scargiver.  Alas, Snyder's only hope for not taking home a multitude of Razzies this year lies in this film's late release and the distinct possibility that those always unpredictable Razzie voters have already made up their minds.  So, let's just state the obvious upfront. Rebel Moon is not a good film. Rebel Moon is a bad film that makes other bad films look better. It made me briefly contemplate the idea that M. Night's The Last Airbender wasn't really all that bad. Fortunately, I changed my mind. Rebel Moon made me briefly think that Tom Cruise's The Mummy wasn't actually godawful. Again, I changed my mind.  In Rebel Moon, a peaceful colony on the edge of a galaxy finds itself threatened by a tyrannical ruling force. Kora (Sofia Boutella) is a mysterious stranger who lives among them and becomes their best hope for survival. Assembling a small band of warriors - outsiders, insurgents, and orphans of war - she leads battle over the fate of a galaxy. A new army of heroes is formed.  It's important to note that Rebel Moon: Part One is, in fact, the first of a two-parter and one can only hope that we're in for a heck of a lot more story with the second go-round (I doubt it, but one can hope).  When the bad guys arrive, they subsequently demanded the village's entire harvest. They immediately eliminate the village's leader, an act returned by our dear Kora who takes out some soldiers. She is joined by Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) and essentially the film takes off to recruit the warriors who will defend the villagers. These recruits will include:

Charlie Hunnam's Kai, whose performance here is the film's highlight as he at least infuses the proceedings with genuine energy and heart. 

Djimon Hounsou's Titus, a rebel general who's skills are undeniable yet who is also seen as a disgraced man. Part one doesn't take us deeply into this journey or this conflict. Instead, it's like a 2+ hour recruitment video with journeys to different planets, the obligatory battles, and weakly assembled origin stories for each character. The script, co-penned by Snyder with Kurt Johnstad and Shay Hatten, never quite lives into its even basic description and exists with limp dialogue, almost zero meaningful character development, and a narrative that is about as murky as the worlds being created here.  This is not to mean, however, that Part One never works. There are moments that hint at Snyder's intentions here and moments when the film's visual palette clears and becomes rather impressive. There are moments that make you think ""Now, we're going to get going."" Unfortunately, Rebel Moon never gets going.  There will, of course, be those who appreciate Rebel Moon for what it is and that's fine. They're wrong. Rebel Moon: Part One - A Child of Fire is, in fact, simply a cinematic misfire of epic proportions. "
"Dec 23, 2023",negative," You could read Zack Snyder’s latest transgalactic travesty as, in part, an apology for Sucker Punch, his notoriously chauvinistic 2011 romp. Sofia Boutella is not prancing around in exotic lingerie or cooing like an eroticised adolescent. She speaks in arid quips. She wears a properly concealing cape. She punches giant lizards in the face. Kora, the protagonist, is, in short, Regulation Girlboss #349. A role model for the ChatGPT generation. If you want to avoid cliche and overworked influence you have come to the wrong place. The word on Rebel Moon: Part One – no space armada can halt an incoming second spurt – is that Netflix has allowed Snyder, director of 300 and lots of DC rubbish, to develop his own take on Star Wars. That’s not an insane precis. The film follows a plucky band of insurgents as they take on an apparently indestructible fascist regime. Kora is Luke Skywalker. Someone else is Han Solo. There is a cute robot. But the familiarities go back further – deep into the inspirations for the first part of George Lucas’s space opera. If Star Wars didn’t exist critics would be focusing here on the shameless references to Akira Kurosawa’s Seven Samurai. It’s not just that the characters gather together a band (of around about that number) to protect a literal and figurative village from marauders. Rebel Moon is also much at home to pseudo-Japanese set and costume design. The awful thing also plays like yet another gift for the Johnny One-Books who still jaw about Joseph Campbell’s The Hero with a Thousand Faces. Campbell and Kurosawa were, of course, the godfathers of Star Wars. Anyway, never mind all that. The undemanding punter is allowed a slab of mindless space mayhem to while away the yawning afternoons during the Christmas break. Right? As so often with Snyder, one wishes the project were as much fun as it seems on paper. To be fair to the guy, he did discover a sense of humour for the recent, tolerable Army of Thieves, but, though there are attempts at levity here, we are, for the most part, stuck with his dreary stygian self-importance. You will get some sense of the subtlety at work from a summary of the opening section. A happy farming village is disturbed when a space vessel disgorges a legion of smartly uniformed straight-backs – garbed as you’d expect in a fascist-themed production of Julius Caesar – led by the reliably snake-eyed Ed Skrein. He smiles and opens negotiations to appropriate grain for his troops. At least one local reacts like the character in Mad Max 2 who, confronted with the mountainous villain, declared: “This Humungous ... is a reasonable man.” Well, no. After more preamble than is strictly necessary, Lord Skrein, or whatever he is called, takes to battering the citizens to death and stripping the land. “It’s simple. I want everything,” he says. You amaze me, Man in Jackboots and Shiny Peaked Cap. Kora – as so often in Campbellian tales an adoptee to the village – finds herself tasked with assembling a gang to fight back against the oppressors. What we end up with is a colossal, colossally boring preamble to a less-meandering second part that will, I’m guessing, appeal largely to viewers with screwdrivers lodged in their frontal lobes. There are endless hunks of spoken exposition. There is a lot of space travel. A great many uninteresting people are introduced. By the first hour all narrative drive has slackened into a limp connecting thread. One thing does interest, though (if you’ll excuse the spoiler). A surprising number of the worst villains turn out to be Northern Irish or white South Africans. How amusing it would be if the DUP were to call for a boycott."
"Dec 23, 2023",neutral,"Rebel Moon's failure to meet its potential is a shame, as it appeared that Zack copied the answers from the George Lucas test. The lack of originality of the story and characters was shocking to me, considering it’s from a creative mind like Zack. "
"Dec 23, 2023",negative,"It’s not a complete disaster, and I’m a little curious how Part 2 finishes the story that basically comes to a definitive conclusion (no cliffhangers here), but A Child of Fire is largely a whiff."
"Dec 23, 2023",negative," From his critically maligned but fan-favorite Sucker Punch to his infamous internet darling “Snyder Cut” of 2017’s Justice League, Zack Snyder is no stranger to drumming up discourse whenever one of his films nears release. His latest effort for Netflix, Rebel Moon — Part One: A Child of Fire, has already sparked discussions of an R-rated, three-hour director’s cut to give his fans an alternate taste before Rebel Moon — Part Two hits the streaming platform early next year. But while Snyder may do his best to invent a dark, gripping universe to engross viewers, Rebel Moon is a limp, soulless regurgitation of tropes stolen from much more formidable films. Written, directed, produced, and shot by Snyder, Rebel Moon follows Kora (Sofia Boutella), a battle-hardened soldier with a tragic past. Though she’s attempting to live a low-profile life on a peaceful farming colony, Kora is forced to once again take up the mantle of warrior when the Motherworld sends a military contingent led by the brutal Admiral Noble (Ed Skrein) to occupy her new home. With the help of a humble farmer (Michiel Huisman) Kora sets off on a galaxy-spanning adventure to recruit a ragtag group of fighters to defend her homeland. Attempting to establish an original, engrossing science-fiction world is no small task, even for the most adept of writers, and it’s painfully clear that Snyder took heavy aesthetic and stylistic notes from genre classics like Star Wars and Dune, without understanding the story and emotional beats that made those aforementioned franchises so beloved. Certainly, there’s all manner of science-fiction spectacle in Rebel Moon to gawk at: the characters are all dressed in tattered greyscale robes, wielding retrofuturist weapons and talking about the “Motherworld” and the “Imperium.” But while every element of production design, costuming, and worldbuilding is certainly specific, none of them are inspired or purposeful. Instead, Rebel Moon’s stylistic sensibilities feel like Snyder simply tossed all the sci-fi greats into a blender and called it a day. Extensive attention is paid to plotting out  lore and history, but Snyder forgets to flesh out the characters that populate his meticulously detailed universe. Aside from Kora, whose tragic backstory and brutal upbringing are delivered entirely through clunky monologues of exposition that bleed into extensive flashback sequences, the rest of Rebel Moon’s sizable ensemble cast are eacg allotted five minutes of dialogue, if that. Kora and her crew flit to a new planet, are treated to a dazzling display of their new ally’s combat prowess, given the CliffsNotes version of their tragic backstory (is there any other kind?), and then that character simply falls in among the ranks, never to be examined or explored with any real intentionality again. As for Kora herself, Boutella brings the customary strength and stoicism expected of a YA dystopian protagonist with none of the heart or passion. Constantly glowering out from underneath her dark crop of hair, Kora is a painfully uninteresting hero whose stoicism is certainly understandable given her history, but whose personality could not make for a more tepid protagonist. Though she’s plenty ferocious in combat, Kora is detached and distant when not embroiled in a fight, giving the entire film a remote, inaccessible emotional core. At two hours and 15 minutes, Rebel Moon is a laborious moviegoing experience—why should the audience care about the film’s events when the protagonist herself barely seems to?  Rebel Moon’s lack of interest in exploring its own characters is made all the more frustrating by the cruel, visceral nature of its villains—while we don’t get much personality from Kora, Gunnar, and the other wannabe heroes, we are treated to several extended sequences that revel in the cruelty and violence of the Imperium. The vaguely fascist ruling faction is clearly an underbaked stand-in for Star Wars’ Empire, but Snyder mistakes onscreen brutality for effective writing. The film’s first act subjects viewers to an extended sequence of Imperium soldiers attempting to rape a villager, a scene that serves no other purpose than making explicitly clear to the audience that the authoritarian military occupiers are, in fact, bad guys. The world Snyder has created is a cold, brutal one, utterly lacking in any kind of charm, whimsy, or excitement. The closest Rebel Moon ever comes to eliciting any kind of emotional response is during the action-packed, slo-mo heavy combat sequences. Stories like Star Wars and Dune soar by using far-fetched worlds and fantastical settings to interrogate relatable, deeply human ideas. Rebel Moon, on the other hand, trades in the aesthetic trappings of those classics without making the effort to engage on any emotional or philosophical level. Though Rebel Moon ends on a relative cliffhanger with the promise of a sequel on the horizon, it’s difficult to imagine why one would want to subject themselves to  another two hours in this soulless slog of a universe. Certainly, Snyder is a master of his particular brand of highly stylized action sequences, but the sheer lack of emotional stakes and memorable characters renders Rebel Moon toothless."
"Dec 23, 2023",positive," NOW ON NETFLIX! Things are getting mighty funky behind the sky in the first installment of director Zack Snyder’s galactic epic Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child Of Fire. A dynasty of a thousand kings has ruled a slab of space, but that is all over as the last of the bloodline was assassinated. Down on the farm on some backwater planet, Kora (Sofia Boutella) is hard at work behind a plow. Her co-worker Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) oversees the grain harvested and seems to have a sweet on her.  However, their planet is invaded by Nazi-like space tyrants who are taking over civilizations or wiping them out in the memory of the slain king. At first, the villagers believe they could cooperate with Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein), the leader of the death squad that has landed. Kora warns them that the tyrants will take and take until nothing is left, but the villagers find out the hard way. Kora goes to flee the village but is waylaid when the invaders try to trap her and another village girl in a gang rape. Soon, Kora has to travel to the worst spots of her planet and beyond to recruit a band of outcasts and outlaws that can defend her village against the deadly dreadnaught. If you think you have heard this story before, think again. First off, know going in that I am not a Snyder absolutist. I am underwhelmed by half of his work, though I am quite overwhelmed with the other half. Watchmen never got as interesting as its opening credits, and Army Of The Dead was a dud. However, Justice League: Justice Is Gray is possibly the most beautiful black and white movie I have ever seen, and I appreciate his dark slant on the Superfriends. So, while I was curious about Rebel Moon, I also wasn’t going to forgive any missteps.  So I spent the first 40 minutes picking the s**t out of it. Everything seemed subdued and pedestrian, with the only grandeur supplied by the soaring soundtrack. Then Snyder does what Lucas did with the Cantina and whips out the monsters. Suddenly, we start to get an inkling about how far out we are going to be taken. Then, Snyder widens the scope of the visuals with each major movement. So, instead of a sprint from start to finish, the script by Snyder with Kurt Johnstad and Shay Hatten climbs a set of stairs instead, getting higher and higher into its concept. It is the perfect example of what the great critic Quentin Crisp called the crucial variety of tone. I appreciate the thoughfulness of your analysis. Myself, I’m a simple person, and I thought it was a big bucket of dumb. I thought there was “excessive grain obsession”. A galactic empire – capable of wormhole (one supposes) travel – has a tough time with agriculture? But whatever. One man’s grain is another man’s MacGuffin. I turned off my brain at about the 25 minute mark and just watched the gunfights.  On the plus side, many of the visuals were top notch. Some of the action sequences were well done. And despite it all, I will watch the next one …. once. Because who don’t like explosions? On February 4-5, 2006, horror returns to Texas, thanks to Loyd Cryer. The life-long horror fan decided to take the plunge and put on his own horror... “We can never see past a choice we don’t understand”. 
And Morpheus old buddy, there’s no way we can see past a plot point we don’t understand...

"Dec 23, 2023",positive," There’s usually some kind of disturbance in the force happening when there’s a 50 per cent difference between critical and public review ratings of a film on Rotten Tomatoes, and Zack Snyder’s initial cut of his $166 million space opera for the Netflix streamer is very the much the kind of project which revolts the snooty glitterati but delights the casual viewer. With Part Two in the can, as we say in the biz, and scheduled for April next year, Snyder is hoping to launch The Scargiver as the first of a trilogy of sequels to this opener, and while this critic admittedly came to scoff at Snyder’s efforts, A Child of Fire is a better-than-decent slice of crowd-pleasing sci-fi with a young, game cast, slick visuals and some wild ideas. With this year’s Barbie included, it’s fashionable to bash Snyder, and I certainly saw a chance for snark when I read the following on the film’s Wiki page ‘On June 8, 2022, it was announced that Anthony Hopkins had joined the cast as the voice of Jimmy, an impossibly sentient JC1435 mechanized battle robot and one-time defender of the slain king.’ Hopkins even narrates the opening sequence, and his robot knight has a quasi-messianic yet pagan look, garlanded with flowers and antlers, which fits right in with the semi-religious feel of the Rebel Moon universe. If Star Wars adopted the key elements of Kurosawa’s Hidden Fortress, then Snyder has the right to do something similar with Seven Samurai, itself the basis for John Sturges’ The Magnificent Seven and Roger Corman’s Battle Beyond the Stars (1980). So, the monarchy-loving, militaristic empire of the Motherland have sent the horrid Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein) and his doomy dreadnaught space-ship The King’s Gaze to oppress the sexy, funky planet of gardeners that is Veldt, where their work ethic sounds like a Kool and the Gang song; ‘Make Love Tonight!’. Yes, on lyrical, verdant Veldt, they’ve made a connection between hearty sex and a healthy lifestyle, and are preparing for the rumpy-pumpy which will infuse their crops; ‘the sound of our pleasure will summon the seedlings!’ This fertile ritual sounds like it might be fun to watch, but before they can get down on it, Noble’s men put a damper on their pastoral ardour by demanding a Biblical tithe; ten weeks to generate a tribute of many thousand bushels. That gives rebel Kora (Sofia Boutella) and her farmer pal Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) less than three months to find some more tough guys and gals to stand up to Noble and take down his battle-cruiser to start a rebellion against authoritarian might. ‘We’re from a small village looking to hire some fighters’ is the all-you-need-to-know takeaway about Kora’s age-old mission. So sure, we’ve been here before, but not with Snyder who injects some surprising elements into a classic space opera story of feuding Hawkshaws and Bloodaxes, and not just his Peckinpah-in-zero-gravity action style shown off to good advantage here. Snyder also skips making this space-adventure primarily for kiddies, and as the opening text warns, there’s a strong elements of sexual threat, from the Mines of Daggus to the brothel/cantina that Kora unwisely seeks help in. Rebel Moon rises to a Jodorovsky look at times, notably Noble’s henchwomen are straight out of The Holy Mountain, and the baddies really are bad; if Zack Snyder think that it’s a bad thing to ‘relish the ecstasy of combat’ like the Motherland does, you’re pretty far gone, and it’s probably for the best that we don’t get to see Noble get his desired wish to ‘split that sapling’ when confronted by Kora. Is Kai, the mercenary pilot hired by Kora and played by Charlie Hunnam, a reliable soul or not? Can Fabio-style Prince Tarak (Staz Nair) tame his giant crow and find true happiness? Why does Ed Skrein cuddle up with a sexy snake that seems to poke through various orifices in his torso? There’s literally tonnes of Dune-lite world-building going on here, and Rebel Moon generally looks good, with Snyder clearly invested in his universe of mechanical bounty hunters, teeth-rattling conflicts and astral energy, with a notably strong sound-design and score to keep things interesting. Of all the festive blockbusters for 2023, this is probably the we’re getting closest to an Avatar-style epic, and those who seek a blast of outer-space action should get their interstellar kicks on Snyder’s Rebel Moon. Pretty impressed. Given all the critical fuss I expected to stop watching pretty quick. Instead, I found it very enjoyable and aimed at an adult audience – which Oppenheimer and Barbie have proved beyond doubt exists.  Fairly zimmed along and the climax took me by surprise. I was expecting something more dour and leaden. Though I did think it was Richard Attenborough’s plummy voice doing the opening narration. I knew it was Hopkins, probably for the price of a Picasso; he reads that text with such feeling and so ripely! I was totally ready for a hate watch, but had to restart after twenty minutes when I realised it was good. Better than Guardians or The Flash or Ant-Man or the vast majority of what’s out there. And like you, I thought the climax was sharp and came up suddenly, no messing around. Barely one in five critics thought this was passable, but I’m happy to be in a minority. Join the Rebellion! I’m pushing against a tide here, but I liked this a lot more than I expected. Feel free to post a link with your alternative view! I have read that there is an extended cut that is what Snyder really wanted to do, and the same with part 2 and they will be released once the short versions have been put out, so sometime next year. Netflix wanted the pg13 version first so kiddies can watch it and Snyder wanted an R rating so they let him do both. I might hang on for those. Even in this family friendly PG-13 version, there’s a few scenes where we’re clearly looking at horrible off-screen scenes which are about the be put back in for the Snyder-cut. But this is way more adult than Aquaman 2 and is worth your time; don’t listen to snobby critics! Come on, Bunty, this is big sci-fi action fantasy fun, don’t deny yourself! You can watch it on your new Nokia flip-fone! Live the dream! Hopkins gives it his all; he puts such feeling into his opening narration, even if neither he nor I could understand it. He certainly keeps busy, and while his work on Shadowlands and The Remains of the Day is widely admired, to me, he’ll always be Jimmy the sentient droid. Sure, it’s space Nazis again, when is it not? But intergalactic pagan sex harvests is new. Don’t pretend you’re not intrigued. Actual sci-if ideas bolted into a Western plot, as per. This demo site is only for demonstration purposes.

"Dec 23, 2023",positive,"Rebel Moon doesn’t change the game in terms of sci-fi action epics. It features a strong mix of characters, some memorable action sequences and a sequel already filmed with an April 2024 release date. And sometimes that's all that's needed."
"Dec 23, 2023",negative," You may be tempted to further curse the existence of the Star Wars prequels for seemingly informing the upsettingly turgid sci-fi epic Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire (now on Netflix), the first volley in a planned megafranchise from love-him/hate-him filmmaker Zack Snyder. Let it be known that I’m no knee-jerk Snyder hater – I’ll still defend Watchmen and some aspects of 300, and for my nickel, 2021’s amusing Army of the Dead kinda redeemed him after making a few pretty terrible Superman movies. But Rebel Moon finds him leaning on his worst Snyderesque tendencies, not the least of which is releasing this, the first of a two-parter, which reportedly will be followed by an extended R-rated cut, and then Part Two – The Scargiver (confirmed for April 2024 release), and then an extended R-rated cut of that one, and then probably a gigantic 193-hour megacut of both films that’s sure to feature more stultifying exposition and overstylized violence than anyone of sound mind would ever want. As it is, the 133 minutes of A Child of Fire already feels like way more than enough.  The Gist: We open with – wait, is that Anthony Hopkins narrating? Yes it is. A bona-fide knighted Englishman with Oscars on his shelf has now been in both a Michael Bay Transformers movie and a Zack Snyder movie, the latter of which features him giving voice to a blatant C-3PO ripoff while we scratch our heads and groan. And we haven’t even gotten to the what of Hopkins’ narration, which immediately buries us in backstory, and is not at all a particularly good way of opening a movie. Let’s just say the galaxy is ruled by an evil empire of Space Nazis – they even have the hats and epaulets and shitty haircuts and everything – cruising around in warships that look like flying U-boats, conquering the living saliva out of the worlds they come across. And as these things go, a revolution brews and stews on some secret planet somewhere. Needless to say, if you’re a Space Nazi, that revolution must be squashed like a squash you’d stomp with your jackboot. MEANWHILE, on a small nothing of a moon, some humble farmers farm the soil and say things like, “We’re just humble farmers. We have no interest in your politics,” you know, cornball shit like that. One of those farmers is Kora (Sofia Boutella), who of course isn’t just a farmer. You also getting some major More Than What She Seems vibes from this lady and her silently brooding brow? Of course you are. Kora exists among peasants bronzed by the sun and rendered lean by hard work and clad like 18th-century quakers. They are truly a chamber pot society who couldn’t stand up against fascist cretins with spaceships and laser guns, which is exactly what happens when evil fartknocker Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein) and his rapey Proud Boy soldiers show up to sexually assault the women and take the harvest. Atticus leaves some of his cruel turdburglars in charge, and that’s when Kora goes Wonder Woman on them, but only if Wonder Woman didn’t mind killin’ some folks. Turns out that Kora used to belong to the Space Nazis, and that’s how come she’s such a skilled whupper of asses. And now it’s on her to make sure all the humble farmers don’t get slaughtered, so she and generic guy Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) set off to assemble a crew. What kind of crew, you may ask? Is it ragtag? An assemblage of diverse types from various worlds? Maybe a guy who resembles a Native American warrior (Staz Nair)? A samurai-type woman (Doona Bae) with laser machetes because lightsabers have been very much done before? A smirking smuggler (Charlie Hunnam) with a jalopy airship? A could of heavily facepainted leaders of the standing rebellion (Ray Fisher and Cleopatra Coleman)? Djimon Hounsou in another utterly thankless supporting role? Sure. Why not cram a walking carpet in there while you’re at it. Throw them in a trash compactor maybe, before they face off against the galactic totalitarians. Now, if only this movie played out with the thrills and suspense of other movies that are just like this one. What Movies Will It Remind You Of?: It rhymes with “flar nores.” Also, some serious misguided ambition here a la Jupiter Ascending and the hey-they-only-released-half-a-sci-fi-epic frustrations of Denis Villeneuve’s Dune. Memorable Dialogue: A prime example of the dialogue, which is mostly meaningless mouthfuls of words, via Kora: “It seemed a myth or metaphor created in response to the generations of war and conquest,” she says, speaking like any normal person would. Our Take: Oh hi – you caught me looking up synonyms for “turgid.” Rebel Moon COLON Part One DASH A Child of Fire finds Snyder killing us slowly with relentlessly awful exposition, a marked lack of originality, boilerplate sci-fi characters, plot twists and betrayals with little dramatic impact and greenscreens greenscreens greenscreens. Oh, also Snyder’s trademark slo-mo, all the better for him to stage his heroes in iconic poses and either drive us nuts or force his fans to convince themselves that that shit is super cool, bro, and not at all cheesier than a Wisconsin truckstop.  Writing alongside Kurt Johnstad and Shay Hatten, Snyder spends an inordinate amount of time schlepping his protagonists across the galaxy, Kora gathering up pals to help her out, the various locations identified by stultifying subtitles along the lines of GLADIATOR ARENA OF CASTOR – MOON OF POLLUX. Needless to say, by the time they get to UNREGISTERED TRADE DEPOT – GONDIVAL you’ll be checked right the eff out. The movie has a few notable moments where it threatens to get interesting; a “cantina” scene boasting a basketball-sized tabletop tick-creature that controls folks by sinking its slinky tentacles into their brains, or an encounter with a hissing arachnoid-woman who descends from the rafters with impressively evil ceremoniousness. Too bad that stuff amounts to nothing in the long run, tangents off the worn-out path from tranquil opening to noisy finale. Of course there’s a third-act battle, because without one, movies like this just don’t get funded. But if we actually possess the fortitude required to get to that point in the story, our emotional and intellectual investment in what happens will be a million-zillion half-pennies shy of giving a single good god damn about any of it. It doesn’t help that the story is about essentially nothing; the text here is so dense, it shoves the subtext straight into the fiery lava of the Earth’s core. Theoretically, in a world dominated by established IP we should be enthused by the idea of original sci-fi, but junk like this transcends theory into dispiriting reality. Don’t forget, all this is To Be Continued, just like Dune, but way shittier. And very much unlike Dune, the thought of sitting through another one of these is a depressing prospect. "
"Dec 23, 2023",neutral," Sofia Boutella plays Kora, a farmer with a secret past as a soldier, in director Zack Snyder’s “Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire.” (Photo courtesy of Netflix.) With the ungainly title “Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire,” director Zack Snyder’s new monster-sized science-fiction franchise for Netflix launches with a lot of bombast and big action — but for several reasons, not just the ones hinted at by the title, it feels like an unfinished work. The movie starts on a bucolic planet, Veldt, and a young woman, Kora (Sofia Boutella), pushing a plow behind a horse-like creature. She’s a resident of a peaceful village — peaceful until a ship from the ruling Motherworld descends, led by the movie’s main villain, Admiral Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein). Atticus demands the village sell most of its grain harvest to his army, and even kills the village’s leader (an unbilled Corey Stoll) to put fear in the other villagers. Kora is not afraid, and we learn of her backstory that she’s not from this village — but a war-hardened former officer in the Motherworld’s army. The opening narration (by Anthony Hopkins, voicing an enigmatic android) explains that the king of the Motherworld was assassinated, and the power struggle that followed left the nasty Regent Balisarius (Fra Fee) in charge, prompting a rebellion in the outer fringes of the empire. Gee, plucky rebels going up against a powerful evil empire, fighting wars among the stars — where do Snyder and his co-writers, Shay Hatten (who worked on Snyder’s “Army of the Dead”) and Kurt Johnstad (who worked on Snyder’s “300”), get their ideas? (Yes, the legend is that Snyder pitched himself to direct a “Star Wars” movie, and when Lucasfilm turned him down, he recycled his ideas into this.) Kora — who takes down the occupation force Atticus left in the village in one of Snyder’s familiar slow-motion action sequences — teams with Gunnar (Michiel Huisman), a villager who has sold surplus grain to the rebel side, to start assembling rebel fighters to fight against Atticus’ main forces when they return. Thus, Snyder engages in some universe-building, as we hop from one thoroughly production-designed planet after another.  Among those Kora and Gunnar pick up are: A homeless former general (Djimon Hounsou), a vengeful assassin (Doona Bae), a hunky prince (Staz Nair), a rebel leader (Ray Fisher, aka Cyborg from Snyder’s “Justice League”) and a roguish thief and space pilot, Kai (Charlie Hunnam).  Some of the action sequences Snyder devises are propulsive — my favorite is when Bae goes up against a spider-like creature with a head and thorax (played by Jena Malone) that resembles the Borg Queen from the “Star Trek” franchise. But, too often, Snyder falls into his regular habits, creating empty spectacle that’s quite violent, though bloodless enough to get its PG-13 rating.  The world-building is all in the visuals, with no attempt to guide viewers from planet to planet — and the character development is much the same, with only Boutella’s Kora provided much depth or explanation of who she is and how she got here. The audience is forced to fill in the gaps, using the clues of other movies Snyder references. And, perhaps the greatest crime of all for an action franchise, there’s absolutely no humor to lighten the heavy material. As the title tells us, this is the first installment of what has been announced as a two-part epic — the second part, with the subtitle “The Scargiver,” is scheduled for an April release on Netflix. And Snyder has recently said in interviews that this movie, which is two hours and 13 minutes long and carries a PG-13 rating, will have a three-hour, R-rated “director’s cut” released sometime next year. Yes, Snyder himself has succumbed to the allure of “the Snyder cut” that his legion of fans demanded after “Justice League.” The problem with announcing a “director’s cut” for “Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire” is that it tells us Snyder was so disenchanted with his movie that he started editing a different version as a distraction. If the director can’t be bothered to pay attention, why should the rest of us? Starts streaming Friday, December 22, on Netflix. Rated PG-13 for sequences of strong violence, sexual assault, bloody images, language, sexual material and partial nudity. Running time: 133 minutes."
"Dec 22, 2023",positive," Since this film was announced it seems there have been two camps. Snyder’s die-hard fans (the same ones who successfully waged a multi-year campaign of pressure to push Warner Bros to release his cut of “Justice League”) heralded this movie as the coming of a darker, grittier “Star Wars.” Though, to clarify, this movie has nothing to do with “Star Wars.” That’s just the default when talking about sci-fi set in space. And the other camp were those who believe Snyder to be nothing more than a slow-motion enthusiast incapable of making a complete story without releasing 27 cuts of his movies. Despite an abysmal Rotten Tomatoes score and early crucifixion from other critics, “Rebel Moon” is a visually-stunning film that has a fun (though thin) narrative and interesting characters who all deserve more backstory. Any fan of “Seven Samurai” or “The Magnificent Seven” is already familiar with this story. A farm village on the independent world of Veldt is visited by a brutal space empire called the Motherworld. They demand grain from the village and vow to return and collect it. And a woman from the village named Kora (Sofia Boutella) has to assemble a ragtag team of warriors to defend the town. The story of “Rebel Moon” doesn’t think far outside the box. And that’s fine because obviously this is a setup that has worked in movies and television for decades. If it ain’t broke, right? Kora travels to nearby planets to assemble her team and recruits a former Motherworld general named Titus (Djimon Hounsou), a cyborg swordswoman named Nemesis (Bae Doona), a rebellion leader named Bloodaxe (Ray Fisher), and an ex-prince who became a blacksmith named Tarak (Staz Nair). Together, they’ll have to defend Veldt against a brutal military machine led by the tyrant Balisarius (Fra Fee). He dispatches an admiral named Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein) to hunt for rebels, and he’ll be the one who leads the crushing attack against Kora’s home. If Kora’s team can’t stop him, Noble will plunder the village’s grain and leave so little behind that the people will starve. “Rebel Moon” is without question a film that puts style ahead of substance. And that’s an automatic sin in the eyes of some critics. But the movie makes up for its thin story and underdeveloped characters by having tons of visual aesthetic. It’s hard to understate how gorgeous this film is. Snyder offers up so many cinematic shots in between his trademarked slow-motion fight sequences. The aliens that inhabit this galaxy are all vibrant and distinct. And each recruit Kora comes in contact with just oozes cool with costume designs that wow and leave viewers wanting to see more. Through all of “Rebel Moon,” the only visual disappointment were the starships. Their designs are rather bland, and the CGI leaves them looking more like objects from an Xbox game rather than a sci-fi blockbuster. But everything else? Stellar. Snyder’s characters all offer hints of deeper story to come in the sequel. And with how much fun this initial outing was, “Rebel Moon” makes for an acceptable IOU with a promise for more grand adventure to come in part two. The film’s biggest issue comes down to relying on the tired trope of sexual assault to quickly establish who the movie’s villains are. “Rebel Moon” has two scenes of sexual assault, and the fact that both a man and a girl are the victims doesn’t exactly balance out. It’s an overused and harmful gimmick that needs to be retired. There are plenty of other ways to show just how evil a film’s antagonists can be that don’t rely on violently pulling assault victims out of the story for entire minutes at a time. “Rebel Moon” didn’t deserve to be shot down so viciously and quickly just because of the man behind the camera. It’s a fast-paced space epic that has a lot to offer. The film isn’t without flaws, but it’s nowhere near as bad as some would have audiences believe. It’s a world full of characters that all deserve much more in the future, and here’s hoping the sequel will deliver on their promises given in part one."
"Dec 22, 2023",neutral," Zack Snyder is a filmmaker who has always put effort into making big, bold, and splashy imagery. Whether it’s superheroes, Spartans, zombies, or an army of owls, Snyder has routinely leaned toward dark and dramatic visual compositions. That would explain why he so often chooses to shoot his action in slow motion, because he wants the images to make an impression. This approach has become such an identifying signature that other areas tend to take a hit, especially when it comes to writing. His latest endeavor, Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire (2023) continues this trend. Despite a wide scope and plenty of spectacle, the weaknesses in story and character make the narrative feel thin. Snyder (who also cowrites with Kurt Johnstad and Shay Hatten) does not hide his cinematic influences. In fact, he places them so much in the forefront that it plays like a badge of honor. Not only does he heavily borrow from Star Wars (1977), but he also lifts from Seven Samurai (1954) which, as it turns out, was a big influence on George Lucas when he made Star Wars. What goes around comes around. Artists paying homage to the past is an old tradition and is not inherently bad in theory. The issue with Rebel Moon is that it does not do enough to set itself apart. Because it follows the same blueprint with little variation, it doesn’t get an opportunity to establish an identity of its own. How can this stand by itself if it keeps reminding us of other films? As the title would suggest, this is the first part of a supposed two-part series. While that knowledge indicates that there is more to this then what is presented, it does leave the initial entry with a lot of loose ends. It would be easy to simply say “Wait for the next installment to see if everything wraps up in a satisfying way,” but we can only review what is given to us. As a standalone film, this takes on an episodic structure, with Kora and Gunnar taking the near two- and a half-hour runtime to pick up or pay off volunteers. Amongst them are Kai (Charlie Hunnam), Tarak (Staz Nair), Nemesis (Bae Donna), Bloodaxe (Ray Fisher), and Titus (Djimon Hounsou). None of them are painted with much dimension. Outside of Kora, who gets plenty of flashback scenes explaining her background, everyone else are made of surface-level traits and motivations. But you’re not here for a deep character study or to examine the philosophical complexities of life under a fascist regime, are you? You want to know if this is fun and if the action is well done, right? In that regard, it’s a toss-up. Snyder and the rest of the production stuff the frame with epic sequences and large-scale set pieces. However, because Snyder is so obsessed with slow motion, it tampers down the excitement. Whenever the visuals pause in the middle of a fight or shoot out, it drains the momentum. The cinematography (also by Snyder) is in love with stopping on a closeup of Sofia Boutella’s face, right when she aims her gun to fire a laser beam. The approach creates a stop/start effect – we want the action to pick up but can’t get there because the slow motion takes us out of it. During another sequence, Tarak risks his life to tame a giant bird-like creature. In the key moment, Tarak jumps off a cliff to land on the animal’s back. The camera screeches to a halt just as Tarak is in the air, with the sun placed perfectly behind him and the bird plastered right below. Are we meant to be witnessing an action scene or a picture from a postcard? When Snyder lets the action play out, it can be entertaining. One of the highlights is a fight scene between Nemesis and a half humanoid/half spider enemy. Wielding dual lightsabers – I mean “Laser Swords” – Nemesis twists and turns to avoid getting punctured by one of the arachnid’s legs. Because the production lays off the slow motion (in relative terms, anyway), the sequence has verve and style and dynamism. The film could have used a lot more of this. Instead, it basks in scenes where everything nearly stops in time, as if it’s telling the audience, “Hey, look at this cool shot, isn’t it awesome?” The textures are caked with dark reds, oranges, and browns, creating a muddy and unappealing palette – as though all the environments are covered in heavy smog. Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire does have its qualities. Ed Skrein plays an imposing and dastardly villain. Anthony Hopkins provides his voice talents to Jimmy, a robot not too dissimilar from one gold-plated character from a galaxy far, far away. It’s telling how Jimmy, despite barely having any screentime, has more emotional resonance than many of the human characters. And that’s the film in a nutshell – a collection of interesting pieces that make a disappointing whole. Perhaps when Part 2 comes out next year, we’ll have a better understanding of the entire story and (hopefully) a greater appreciation for what Snyder and co. are trying to do. As it stands, though, this is a sci-fi adventure that never really shifts out of first gear."
"Dec 22, 2023",positive," REBEL MOON: PART ONE – A CHILD OF FIRE. With Sofia Boutella, Djimon Hounsou, Ed Skrein, Michiel Huisman, Charlie Hunnam. Written by Zack Snyder & Kurt Johnstad & Shay Hatten. Directed by Zack Snyder. Rated PG-13 for sequences of strong violence, sexual assault, bloody images, language, sexual material and partial nudity. 133 minutes. On Netflix. Zack Snyder has made some dark films filled with action and visually compelling images. His latest is so epic it has been split in two, although the films were shot back-to-back. REBEL MOON: PART ONE – A CHILD OF FIRE is now available on Netflix. Its sequel – “Rebel Moon: Part Two – The Scargiver” will drop next April. While the first half takes off after a slow start, it is not a film that will be accused of originality. After a talky prologue where we gather that, as in “Star Wars,” the empire – called “the Motherworld” – is evil, the scene shifts to the bucolic planet of Veldt, where the simple farming community there could have been lifted from any number of westerns. The arrival of a ship helmed by Admiral Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein) is bad news. They want the crops to feed their troops, leaving behind a brutish force to ensure compliance. Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) tries to comply, but after Kora (Sofia Boutella) intervenes to prevent the rape of a young woman, she and Gunnar take off to seek warriors who can help defend their community. If this sounds familiar, it should, as it is the same premise as Akira Kurosawa’s classic “The Seven Samurai” (1954). The rest of Part One consists of their band growing including a thief (Charlie Hunnam), a defeated general (Djimon Hounsou), an expert swordswoman (Doona Bae), a former noble with a special ability with wild creatures (Staz Nair), and one of the rebel leaders (Ray Fisher). There’s even a sympathetic robot who will undoubtedly play a bigger role in the second film, voiced by none other than Anthony Hopkins. Of course each of the characters must get their own introductory vignette, and by the time they get back to Veldt the movie’s over and it’s time for next year’s follow-up. The problem here isn’t that it’s dull, but that you can practically see the serial numbers on what Snyder and his two co-writers lifted from other movies. Hunnam’s character enters in a scene reminiscent of the cantina in “Star Wars,” complete with a variety of alien characters. Nemesis, the swordswoman, has not one but two swords that strongly resemble light sabers. She battles a grotesque creature that’s half woman/half spider, and very similar to the Borg Queen in the “Star Trek” universe. One of their number turns out to be a traitor (paging Lando Calrissian from “The Empire Strikes Back”), while Admiral Noble seems to be modeled after the Nazi villain of numerous World War II dramas. The cast does their best not to make their characters two-dimensional with some even achieving all three dimensions, particularly Boutella since her Kora is given the most complete backstory, including flashbacks. The fight scenes and special effects are effective, although much more violent than in the “Star Wars” movies. That this got a PG-13 rating instead of an R shows how much more lenient the ratings board is with violence as opposed to nudity and sexual situations. Daniel M.

"Dec 22, 2023",negative," And now the diabolical director is zapping the enjoyment out of outer space, too, in “Rebel Moon — Part One: Child of Fire” on Netflix.  While that winding, buzzword-filled title sounds like a cheap-o parody of a science-fiction epic, this is about as unfunny and unadventurous a movie as you could possibly imagine. Our Tatooine rip-off is an orange-hued world called Veldt where a group of uptight grain farmers push around dirt all day long and then gather in a meeting house to speak like they’re Moses from the Old Testament. They sleep in what resemble 1800s Irish peat houses that are incongruously souped up with electric sliding doors and fluorescent lights.  Actually, the overall look of “Rebel Moon” is a grab-bag of mismatched time periods and multicultural visual references in a desperate attempt to be clever. However, because they so vastly overdo it, none of these places are believable even in the context of spaceships, reptillian aliens and villains named Balisarius (Fra Fee).  When the benevolent King of the Motherworld is slain and the totalitarian Regent (pretty much the Emperor from “Star Wars”) takes the reins, he sends a store-brand evil admiral named Atticus (Ed Skrein) and his jarhead henchmen to plunder and conquer.  The thugs demand Veldt hand over most of their precious grain supply, killing several citizens after they refuse. So, secret local badass Kora (Sofia Boutella) embarks on a mission with soft-spoken farmer Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) to recruit a crew of warriors to help the town. “I was taught that love is a weakness, and I don’t know how that will ever change,” Kora says. “To love and be loved — I don’t know if I’m capable of either.” Well, what I know is that when a character makes a cement-truck comment like that, they’ll probably tie the knot at the end of Part 2. The rescued townsfolk can throw some of that grain at the happy couple. Spinning-and-kicking Nemesis (Bae Doona) gets in an unpleasant bout with a half-woman-half-spider who is stealing another planet’s children. A once-powerful general named Titus (Djimon Hounsou) has slid into drunkenness. Tarzan-y Tarak (Staz Nair) gets his “Avatar” moment when he tames a wild flying horse and successfully rides it off a rocky cliff. Kai (Charlie Hunnam) is Han Solo. We don’t find out that much about any of these people, nor do we want to. The middle of “Rebel Moon” is a failed speed dating exercise in which a second meet-up is not in the cards. With a second chapter on the way, perhaps the clashing finale can be forgiven for being not so grand. One person dramatically sacrifices their life, and we shrug because we’ve only just met them a few minutes ago. Another double-crosses the group, and we shrug because we’ve only just met them a few minutes ago."
"Dec 22, 2023",negative," Nothing causes something to fail at a goal like trying far too hard to achieve it. Whether it’s an individual trying to look tough or a science fiction story that wants the viewer to believe that it belongs among the great epics that came before it, those who observe these displays do not walk away convinced of the desired message, but rather, they walk away pitying the level of insecurity and neediness they project. While Rebel Moon Part 1 takes some big swings, it ultimately falls flat, trying to showcase too much, too fast, and leaving the viewer with that overwhelming feeling of desperation to impress. The movie opens with a sizable information dump as it lays out the important elements of the world’s history.Paired with the appearance of an impressive-looking starship coming out of this setting’s version of hyperspace, both audio and visuals set the tone and scale for the coming film. The CGI is crisp and clean, as will the visual effects be throughout the story’s two-hour and fifteen-minute runtime. However, this is the first element of many that leans into my above critique. ‘The film tries too hard to push the scale it boasts. One of the ways in which it does this is by calling out things like how the dynastic line of this empire had been unbroken for a thousand years. While this sort of scope is good to give a viewer, working it into a conversation rather than outright exposition avoids the feeling that it is there to impress, as opposed to building out a world seamlessly and naturally. From this initial display of the intimidating authority of the central government’s Imperial power, the film jumps to our small farming village, where we are introduced to the film’s lead, Kora (Sofia Boutella, Guillermo Del Toro’s Cabinet of Curiosities). Seen guiding a plow horse across a field with an enormous, red, ringed planet in the background, this shot is visually stunning. From here, the film begins its work to establish the idyllic life of this small farming village. It is a bit ironic that the sequence the film handles best is the one that has nothing to do with epic grandeur. The presentation of the town and the joyful, if simple, life it provides its people is filled with warmth and goodness. Kora is called from the field to participate in a feast, celebrating the coming planting and petitioning the gods to bless their future crops. Food, drink, and celebratory mating (don’t worry, it’s off-screen) are all on the menu. The sheer joyful energy that fills the gathering ensures that it will hit the viewer when the world comes crashing down around them. Sure enough, the next day, the residents of the village begin planting their crops, only to have their day disturbed by the appearance of a Dreadnaut class starship, King’s Gaze. Led by Admiral Noble (Ed Skrein, Alita: Battle Angel), the Imperial landing party brings demands of grain to support its troops as they root out local resistance elements. Here, we see Snyder’s vision come in with all the subtly of a sledgehammer. The viewer needs to know that the Imperial government is evil, and the film wastes no time in establishing this fact. Noble and his men go to such egregious lengths to showcase how bad they are that it borders on the ridiculous. Harm is not only directed at beloved leaders of the community, but the troops waste no time pushing far more indiscriminate violence upon the community, all but ensuring an eventual loss of compliance from the townspeople. These people aren’t just evil. They seem psychotic, so much so that it makes the viewer wonder how they could ever manage to build up such a grandiose empire in the first place. It also undercuts Noble as the major villain of the film. Science fiction tales are filled with intimidating bad guys that make not only their worlds’ but the audience themselves quake. Noble, sadly, does not fit this bill. Rather than a powerful threat, Noble comes across as a bully, one who has more likely earned his lofty spot in the Imperial Navy through family connections than success in combat or governance. Wedged in the middle of Rebel Moon Part 1’s opening descent into peril for the village is a perfect highlight for another of the film’s major failings: rushed character arcs. The rest of the time spent in the village is spent in a worldwide of introducing characters, speedily setting up an arc that feels like it could play out over the course of the entire film, only to see it resolve less than ten minutes after its introduction. Making the effect even more lessened is the fact that much of the drama that plays out is telegraphed beforehand, making the direction of these character narratives completely predictable. This madcap rush through character arcs continues throughout the story. Once the immediate situation is resolved, Kora, along with another farmer, Gunnar (Michiel Huisman), seeks to make contact with those who may help defend the town from the retribution that will come once the empire learns that the troops left behind have been killed. For the next third of the movie, we are introduced to an assemblage of rough and ready fighters either looking to be heroes or simply out for vengeance. As each is recruited, we get a sequence showcasing their talents or the resources they bring to the enterprise. The movie is so hard-pressed to fit these entries in, though, that we get little time with the growing cast in between additions, making several of Rebel Moon Part 1’s final moments far less impactful than they are clearly intended to be. Sacrifices, betrayals, and heroic victories feel empty, even as the film does everything it can to push how impressed and dazzled the viewer should be. While the forced speed of the narrative makes story beats and characters never land, the actors themselves feel like they are giving their all to breathe as much life into their personalities as the plot permits. Charlie Hunnam works hard to craft the roughish smuggler energy his character is going for, while Djimon Hounsou breathes as much of the command presence his failed general persona can in the handful of moments he actually gets to speak. I genuinely felt sorry for the cast as they seemed to really feel for the roles they had been asked to bring to life but were never given the means to do so. Furthering the loss of impact for many of these moments is the less-than-stellar choreography in Rebel Moon Part 1. While I would never call it bad, it fails to create the image of skillful warriors it strives for. Kora is clearly intended to be a John Wick-level combat monster, slaying large numbers of enemies single-handedly. Sadly, the choreography never manages to make Kora feel nearly so deadly, and her opponents never feel like they are as hard a challenge as the ones delivered in the aforementioned franchise. Half of what makes a hero feel exceptional is overcoming a villain that is equally so. Kora is never given that chance, as her antagonists never fail to elevate themselves beyond forgettable cannon fodder. Even the climactic final one-on-one fight is against an opponent whose only melee accomplishment to that point is beating an unarmed man to death with a glorified walking stick. I should hope our mysterious, badass lead can handle him. The other thing that does the combat in Rebel Moon Part 1 no favors is Snyder’s continued obsession with slow motion. If you are one of the many who feels like overuse of this technique sucks the life out of combat sequences, you will not enjoy this ride. If you do, this film may be for you. The only element that shines brightly throughout Rebel Moon Part 1 is its score from composer Tom Holkenborg. From start to finish, the music is filled with sweeping themes, energetic fight music, and ominous tones that feel like they deserve to be attached to a better movie. It works so hard, but music in cinema is like the sauce on a steak, if the steak is overcooked, no amount of sauce can make it good, it can just make the meal pass a bit less painfully. While Rebel Moon Part 1: Child of Fire displays some strong visual effects and a gorgeous soundtrack, virtually everything else in the film fails. Rushed arcs, underwhelming combat, and the need to push the scale and grandiose nature of the setting bring the narrative down, making it underwhelming at best and outrightly bad at worst.

"Dec 22, 2023",negative,There is intriguing lore in this universe in the canvas of this galaxy. It's just not delivered to you in a way that feels organic.
"Dec 22, 2023",neutral," In Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire Zack Snyder (300, Watchmen, Man of Steel, Justice League) attempts to launch his own Star Wars-style franchise, beginning with two Netflix films and with plans for so much more. With Child of Fire, Snyder demonstrates the vast scope of his imagination, but at the same time, he fails to provide a compelling enough hook to pull viewers into that vast universe of ideas. What we get instead in Rebel Moon: Part One is a whole lot of ""telling"" and very little ""showing,"" with a lot of necessary backstory and characterization being delegated to the multitude of spin-off projects that are already in the works – including the ""real"" version of this very film, which already has an R-rated director's cut on the way.  The story of Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire opens at a pivotal point in this universe's history: a sudden coup in the military empire known as the Motherworld. A princess gifted with the power of life is assassinated, and in her place stands Balisarius, a senator who seizes the power of Regent over the Motherworld, and renews its campaign of war and conquest across the galaxy. That war reaches the farming planet of Veldt, where the farmers are coerced by Balisarius' ruthless admiral Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein) into supporting the Motherworld and its war efforts with their grain harvests. When the farmers resist, Noble and his men turn savage on them – forcing local girl Kora (Sofia Boutella) to reveal her true identity as a former member of the Motherworld's elite warrior force, the Imperium.  When Kora finds herself exposed, and her adopted home on Veldt threatened, she joins pilot/mercenary Kai (Charlie Hunnam) on a journey across the galaxy to recruit other infamous warriors who hate Balisarius and/or the Imperium. The group Kora gathers is filled with souls as broken as they are skilled, and together they try to find either salvation, redemption, or both, by defeating Noble.  On a positive front, Rebel Moon is indicative of just what a talented visual creator Zack Snyder is. The world of this franchise is a clear hodgepodge of ideas from different genres and periods of history (sci-fi, fantasy, ancient mythology, Eastern influences like samurai and anime), and ideas unique to Snyder and co., all cooked together into one strange brew. The film inspires confidence that an entire franchise universe can be built off of this beginning – but then again, that potential for a bigger franchise comes at the cost of this standalone chapter.  Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire plunges us into this franchise universe as if we understand all the events that preceded it and the impact on the various characters. Little is done to make us feel those emotions and/or connections with the ensemble of characters – and it's impossible to fully understand how their individual stories inspire each character to form an unspoken bond with the others as warriors willing to die together. By the time the third act reaches the climactic battle and the guns are blazing, it's equally hard to feel any stakes or fear of losing anyone. It all plays out and, at best, it inspires the intrigue to learn more.  As for the cast, it's equally hard to gauge just how the actors approached their roles; if this standalone project was their sole focus for developing their characters, or were they playing out just a small part of a much larger arc that's been mapped out for them. Each of them is suitable in their parts, but not one of them is all that distinct, dynamic, or memorable. It feels like we get initial sketches of these players, but the real dramatic meat is being saved for later.  Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire is a flashy but hollow advertisement for the larger multimedia IP that will follow. Could we one day look back at this first chapter – with the full context of the franchise behind it – and feel more emotional impact about its events? Possibly, but that day is not today. "
"Dec 22, 2023",negative,"I'm watching this wishing more franchise movies looked for visual grace notes the way Snyder does. At the same time, I’m watching this wishing someone gave Snyder script notes, saving us the tropes and operatic cheesiness he leans so heavily on."
"Dec 22, 2023",negative," Crumbling under the weight of its own visionary grandiosity, Zack Snyder’s Rebel Moon is a series of amazing-looking sets and costumes and effects looking for a story, characters, emotion — really, anything that might raise the pulse. Maybe part of that is due to the fact that this, like so many other movies nowadays, is a Part One — subtitled A Child of Fire, which could mean that the real fireworks will come in the next installment. But the film’s constant missed opportunities suggest otherwise, as it lumbers from uninspiring set piece to uninspiring set piece with little drama, charm, or personality. The background of Rebel Moon actually presented some cause for optimism. Director Snyder apparently pitched the idea initially to Lucasfilm as a Star Wars project. They said no, but he made it anyway — for Netflix, changing little more than a few proper names along the way. That’s a great Zack Snyder story; I may not love the man’s movies, but I do admire his doggedness. The film even begins in Star Wars–y fashion, with some belabored narration from Anthony Hopkins giving us the portentous backstory of the Mother World, a planet of decadent kings and queens who used up all their resources and now send imperial dreadnoughts into the far reaches of space to mine and plunder other worlds. Of course, in George Lucas’s original Star Wars movies, such opening information (presented as an onscreen crawl) occupied a middle ground between pomposity and cheese, their florid portent tempered by the fact that they were, in the end, giant words flying through space to the operatic strains of John Williams brass. Those opening crawls announced the kind of movie we were about to see: sincere but playful. Here, the opening voice-over also announces the kind of movie we’re about to see: self-important, confusing, clichéd. Snyder’s story is a variation on Akira Kurosawa’s assembling-a-ragged-team-of-warriors saga The Seven Samurai — a premise already borrowed by films ranging from The Magnificent Seven to A Bug’s Life, not to mention Roger Corman’s infamous 1980 sci-fi film Battle Beyond the Stars, itself a Star Wars rip-off. But no matter; it’s a sturdy premise, which is why it tends to work. This time, the person doing the assembling is Kora (Sofia Boutella), a young refugee hiding out as a farmer on the planet Veldt. Her life is upended when her small village is visited by imperial emissaries led by the fascistic Admiral Atticus Noble (a deliciously reptilian Ed Skrein), who promptly kills the local chief and announces they are seizing the village’s grain harvest. Kora, who we soon learn has a past connection to the highest rungs of the Mother World, runs off with her guilt-ridden farmer friend Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) to try and assemble a small army to fight off the invaders. One reason why the Seven Samurai setup works is that it allows for a diverse set of characters who can be introduced in creative ways and then interact with each other in entertaining fashion. Snyder has done one part of this work, as our heroes travel to eye-popping new planets and moons to recruit their champions. We meet the statuesque, disgraced aristocrat Tarak (Staz Nair) on a farm where he’s being held captive due to a gambling debt, and where he has to tame a giant winged creature called a Bennu. We meet Nemesis (Doona Bae), a grieving sword master, as she fights a pissy, baby-stealing spider played by Jena Malone. General Titus (Djimon Hounsou), is a disgraced former military leader who once turned his forces on the Mother World; we find him collapsed, drunk, and ragged, at the entrance of a massive gladiator coliseum. There isn’t nearly as much action in the film as one would expect, however — precious little gladiatin’, for example, despite that impressive-looking coliseum — and when there is, it’s filmed in that hyper-slow-motion style that Snyder loves so much. Perhaps he feels it gives these characters a sense of mythic grace; that’s how it worked in 300 (2007), the hit that made his career and helped kick off the modern action speed-ramping craze. But as it did in some of Snyder’s superhero movies, the slo-mo overkill actually renders a lot of the fighting less impressive and surprising. At that speed, everything starts to look the same. Even Boutella, a former dancer who has given some physically exhilarating performances in films like Kingsman: The Secret Service and Climax, winds up looking like a generic action-movie lead in Snyder’s hands. The director does deserve his share of credit for how visually impressive all these environments are, not to mention the fascinating design of the various creatures that populate them. Besides the human spider, there’s a glowing, tentacled parasite brain that speaks through animated corpses and pale, grasshopper-faced kings and all sorts of variations on orc. Even the occasional cutaways reveal fascinating-looking bits of costuming and makeup. But all that makes the letdown that much greater when most of the vignettes in the film are resolved with little drama or interesting conflict. Tarak basically wrangles that Bennu with just a bit of fuss, in a flying sequence that’s a pale retread of similar scenes from the Avatar movies. After a nice shower and a brief bit of complaining, General Titus is pretty much ready to go. After Kora tries to convince rebel leaders Devra (Cleopatra Coleman) and Darrian (Ray Fisher) to join their fight, Darrian gives his soldiers a rousing speech before asking for those volunteering to step forward. It feels like the kind of stirring scene we might see at the climax of a film in which we actually got to know these people. Here, these are faces we’ve never seen before. Without any prior context, Darrian’s speech comes out of the blue, and the stirring score and dramatic staging all feel like a huge miscalculation. Now look, Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire is hardly the first or worst offender in what has now become a pandemic of films that have been split in half and thus feel like all premise and no payoff. But when the setup itself is this dull, the lack of payoff stings that much more. Ideally, by the time A Child of Fire ends, we should be invested in these characters and eager to see more of them. Otherwise, what’s even the point? I think back to the original Star Wars (the one from 1977, the one we’re now supposed to call Episode Four: A New Hope). I remember how excited I was to discover Luke and Han and Leia and Chewbacca and the two droids, how fun it was to spend time with them even before that film’s climactic space dogfight. If Star Wars had ended before the big attack on the Death Star, it would still have been Star Wars; it would still have been life-changing for an entire generation. And now consider Rebel Moon and, uh, these guys. Who are they? Why should anybody care what happens to any of them? Of course, the original Star Wars itself is a pretty high watermark for any movie, even a good one, to live up to. And maybe Snyder will deliver something exciting at the conclusion of his fake Star Wars saga. But right now, the only reason I might want to see Part Two would be to feel something, anything. Because Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire is, in the end, just a nice-looking, lifeless slog."
"Dec 22, 2023",negative," Western sci-fi is littered with orientalist tropes, from touchstones like Dune to modern films like The Creator. So, it’s refreshing when something like Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire comes along, with its lucid view of imperialism that steers clear of that ugly influence. Unfortunately, the Netflix-produced space saga quickly squanders its storytelling potential after a powerful first act. It’s the rare Star Wars-based pastiche with somewhat innovative ideas—in fact, it was born from director Zack Snyder’s unrealized pitch to Lucasfilm about a Jedi version of Kurosawa Akira’s Seven Samurai—but the project’s two-part structure leaves this first entry feeling simultaneously overwrought and incomplete. The PG-13 Rebel Moon, now playing in select theaters, arrives on Netflix today with a sequel slated for April, but Snyder has already gone on record as saying his R-rated director’s cut for Part One—which, like the highly demanded “Snyder Cut” of Justice League, will probably stream at some point—is “almost like a different movie.” Upon watching the version Netflix has put out, it’s surprisingly easy to imagine a longer and superior edit. Much of the violence and characterization is implied, but rarely depicted, with intriguing characters being dropped from the movie wholesale while others spring up at random for only a few minutes of screen time. It’s as messy and haphazard as they come, and while the dichotomy of different cuts usually implies a tension or disagreement between studio and filmmaker, Snyder claims to have been in on the idea from the start. The film, therefore, feels incomplete on two fronts: Structurally, it’s a Frankenstein’s monster of a movie; and it also ends on a cliffhanger just as it’s getting started (a frequent problem in 2023, between blockbusters like Fast X and Across the Spider-Verse). It opens much like the Thor movies do, with voiceover from Anthony Hopkins imbuing extraneous exposition about millennia-old lore with surprising weight. None of it really matters—Hopkins’ voice scores scenes of enormous battle ships floating through space—since it’s the verbal equivalent of an opening Star Wars text crawl. All you need to discern from it is that there’s a space king somewhere, and that the story unfolds in his empire. Beyond that, information is conveyed in mostly character-centric ways, at least at first. The major setting is a quaint, Anglo Saxon-inspired agrarian community on Veldt, a planet colony lit by an enormous red star encompassing the entire horizon. Veldt is home to Kora (Sofia Boutella), a quiet, hardworking outsider who diligently plows the fields, even as her doting friend Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) and her adopted father-figure Hagen (Ingvar Sigurðsson) gently suggest a suave local hunter as a potential husband. Kora has only been on Veldt a year, and marriage would be a way for her to become a full-fledged member of the community. While the idea of ethnicity doesn’t explicitly come up in dialogue, it hovers over every scene; Veldt’s villagers are all played by white actors putting on vaguely Scandinavian accents, while Boutella is Algerian. The specter of race becomes entirely unavoidable when a convoy of imperial officers—led by Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein), right-hand man to the king—touches down on Veldt in search of rebels against the empire (known as “The Motherworld”). If it sounds exactly like Star Wars, that is perhaps the point, because it draws from the same well of influences and then multiplies them. The Empire in Star Wars was Nazi-influenced, but in Rebel Moon, the villains wear Nazi uniforms practically un-altered, except for a lack of actual Nazi insignia. The predominantly white soldiers all have either British or South African accents; the scars of real-world colonialism are woven into Rebel Moon’s creative DNA. These imperial forces play on the trust and naïveté of Veldt’s farmers, only to meet them with violence (Skrein is quite imposing in his role), and the only person who seems appropriately afraid is Kora, given that she’s not only seen this kind of violence enacted on her people, but she’s been a pawn to it herself, having been kidnapped and trained by the Motherworld as a child. In distinctly Snyder fashion, flashbacks in the form of vivid, slow-motion action tableaus take us through Kora’s backstory, as a victim of the Motherworld’s fascism, when her sandy home planet was invaded by ruthless military forces. This, too, screams Star Wars in concept, but it goes a step further. Rather than simply using a nebulous Middle Eastern setting, it invokes real-world imperial politics with a clear and direct rebuke of American foreign policy. The narrow streets and crowded buildings of Kora’s home world have hints of Islamic architecture, while the soldiers who unrepentantly reduce it to rubble are adorned with a beige-green armor overtly inspired by modern U.S. military gear. The film, in this way, aligns itself spiritually with George Lucas’s original Star Wars from 1977 which, in addition to modeling its villains off the Third Reich, sought to subtly critique the Nixon era of foreign policy, with the Empire being opposed by bands of scrappy militants organizing in jungles, akin to the Viet Cong. This United States-as-Empire trend would continue in Lucas’s early-2000s Star Wars prequels, which all but put George W. Bush speeches in its villains mouths during their power grabs, but the Disney-owned sequel trilogy of the 2010s would largely avoid such entanglements. Rebel Moon picks up that dropped political baton, by crafting a space opera in which the United States' prolonged “war on terror” in West Asia and North Africa is likened to Nazi occupation. These contemporary and realistic overtones are laced with plenty of fantastical elements too, from spaceships and laser weapons, to ceremonial guards with ornate masks and enormous red headdresses bearing witness to the soldiers’ merciless ambush, like a silent externalization of some unspoken religious fanaticism that’s driving the Motherworld. The first act sees Kora wrestling with how to respond to her place of refuge being invaded by familiar foes. Her first instinct is to run—it’s all she knows how to do—but when the battalion placed on Veldt attempts to sexually assault a local girl (this is a much rougher and grimier Star Wars), she’s forced to make a vital decision. She isn’t the only one, either. The film goes to great lengths to set up not one, but two conscientious objectors to this revolting act: a compassionate Motherworld soldier named Aris (Taiwanese actor Sky Yang), and a humanoid imperial robot, Jimmy (voiced by Hopkins), who has a change of heart after being shown kindness on Veldt. The flashpoint that kicks the plot into motion is this tiny act of rebellion staged by Kora, Aris, and Jimmy, involving guns, axes, and other blades, all filmed in Snyder’s signature speed-ramping style. From left, Doona Bae as Nemesis, Ray Fisher as Bloodaxe, Staz Nair as Tarak, Michiel Huisman as Gunnar, Sofia Boutella as Kora, Charlie Hunnam as Kai, E. Duffy as Milius and Djimon Hounsou as Titus in ""Rebel Moon."" Unfortunately, after meticulously building to this moment, this is also where the movie starts to break down. The action choreography, while fluid and conceptually stunning, falls victim to editing that sanitizes every bit of impact and bloodshed. It has echoes of brutality, but the film always cuts around violence, or presents it out of focus in the background. Once the sequence ends, and Kora has inadvertently attracted the wrath of the Motherworld, she and Gunnar are forced to embark on a secret mission to round up fellow rebels and soldiers to defend Veldt once Noble and his forces return. It’s Seven Samurai, the Japanese classic in which seven scattered fighters join forces to protect a village from bandits (re-adapted numerous times, including in Hollywood’s The Magnificent Seven and Bollywood’s Sholay), in all but setting and name. With four warriors already on Veldt’s roster, it doesn’t seem like it ought to be long before Rebel Moon gets to the action. Well, that would be true if there were any purpose to setting up Aris and Jimmy as such vital and interesting characters. But for some head-scratching reason, not only do they not join Kora and Gunnar on their quest, they also don’t show up in the movie again. As alluring as the film’s first 40 minutes may be, they aren’t followed by what you’d typically describe as a story either progressing, or building to anything of note. Instead, it simply cuts to Kora and Gunnar arriving on different planets (without scenes of them even traveling there) and recruiting various other potential fighters with their own histories against the Motherworld, in scenes that grow progressively truncated. Rebel Moon is essentially a first act followed by five more first acts—each shorter, faster, and more confounding than the last—in which brand new characters are introduced, seem reluctant to join the cause, but are quickly convinced to do so, usually by means of an empty speech from Kora that amounts to “So, you don’t want to fight…but what if you did?” (Cue triumphant music). Apart from Charlie Hunnam’s scumbag mercenary and escape pilot, Kai—who all but turns to the camera and says “I’m Han Solo, but with an Irish accent”—the litany of characters introduced on Kora’s journey do actually have the potential to be fun and interesting. Indian-Russian hunk Staz Nair plays Tarak, an enslaved indigenous man with a connection to animals (which, in this universe, include enormous griffons, resulting in an Avatar-inspired scene of a warrior connecting with a flying beast). Korean actress Bae Doona plays Nemesis, a cyborg and reluctant vigilante plucked from a gothic western, who wields flaming swords that may as well be lightsabers (she shows up fighting a spider-lady played by Jena Malone). But by the time the movie introduces the likes of washed up general Titus (Djimon Hounsou) and sibling revolutionaries Darrian and Devra Bloodaxe (Ray Fisher, Cleopatra Coleman), the screen time they’re afforded becomes increasingly condensed, until the movie devolves into less of samurai riff and more of a samurai parody, depicting the outward shape of familiar story beats before accelerating forward to the next recruitment. This happens ad nauseam until the story arrives at its sudden climax some two hours in, but instead of having the decency to end, it keeps going for nearly another twenty minutes, through an extended epilogue meant to tease the sequel. There’s a good movie hiding somewhere inside Rebel Moon – Part One. Snyder’s passion for this burdened battle-maiden saga shines through in every scene—he’s intent on presenting Boutella as both ripped and thoughtful—while the sci-fi setting is rife with tangible, weathered material awash in foggy atmosphere (Snyder doubles as cinematographer), and led by a visually exciting, multi-ethnic coalition of heroes teaming up to fight space Nazis. It’s a film that looks and feels alive, but beyond its first act, it’s completely dead on arrival, unfolding mechanically while maintaining only the barest appearance of Kurosawa’s classic and its handful Star Wars hallmarks. While it avoids Hollywood’s penchant for orientalism, and instead uses its designs to create an explicit anti-imperial and anti-colonial text, it fails to live up to both its eastern and western influences, and exists only as a mal-formed piece of marketing for something better.

"Dec 22, 2023",negative,"Snyder has his obsessions and his directorial sameness, struggling to sell “A Child of Fire” as something intense and involving when the viewing experience is quite the opposite."
"Dec 22, 2023",negative,"Not as awful as many people are making out, but a frenzied sci-fi wanna-be epic where the talkie scenes land with all the emotional impact of video game cutscenes. Hey, some of us like video games!"
"Dec 22, 2023",negative," Beginning with an epic musical score and grand voiceover before cutting to a vibrant alien sky, Zack Snyder’s Rebel Moon sets the tone for an eye-widening sci-fi adventure. Unfortunately, despite the director’s knack for spectacle, it soon transpires that this first instalment is a bland amalgamation of various other sci-fi flicks, with little in the way of personality or originality of its own. The plot follows a plucky farmer named Kora (Sofia Boutella) who flees her peaceful home after a tyrannical ruler’s ruthless soldiers demand all the village’s harvest. Her goal is to assemble a group of warriors strong enough to fight back against the invaders, and that’s about as far as the script goes in terms of its plot. Much of the film sees Kora and her growing band of companions zipping across various planets and getting into fights along the way. It’s essentially Seven Samurai in space, with elements of Dune and Star Wars sprinkled on top dragged across an over two-hour runtime. The protagonists’ journey takes them to a host of distinct and interesting locations that are home to some strange creatures. These inclusions give glimpses into a vast world full of intrigue, but there’s never enough time spent developing these ideas. One scene, for example, sees Jenna Malone play a half-human-half-spider creature who captures the children of settlers as revenge for what happened to her. Rather than explore this subplot to give the world some flavour, the script blasts past this encounter with another flashy action scene. This absence of worldbuilding likewise extends to the band of heroes. Whereas a large part of the charm and humanity of Kurosawa’s samurai classic came from the characters gradually forming bonds with each other, there’s rarely any interaction between Rebel Moon’s warriors. Most of what viewers need to know about them is told through some quick exposition before they vanish into the background. It doesn’t help that the actors feel like they’re going through the motions, delivering their lines lifelessly. The exception to this being Ed Skrein, who enjoys every second of playing the villainous admiral. Although its gorgeous panoramic shots and slick action scenes make Rebel Moon a good-looking film, its paper-thin plot and underdeveloped characters are what ultimately cause Zack Snyder’s space odyssey to fall disappointingly flat."
"Dec 22, 2023",negative," A shallow imitation of Star Wars, Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire indulges in all of Zack Snyder’s traits as a director, while only constructing the illusion of character and place. Had both been achieved, it would have made the film’s excellent visuals more than just a pretty screensaver. As a huge Star Wars fan, the prospect of Zack Snyder and Netflix‘s take on George Lucas’ critical work was fascinating. Star Wars itself is a mishmash of Lucas’ take on several genres and directors but produced a world that was still wholly original and filled with interesting themes, amazing characters, and analytical themes. So any work based on it brings expectations of similar quality. Well, watching Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire should quickly remove that notion. Lucasfilm’s rejection of Snyder’s idea for a Star Wars film however should have been the first warning that A Child of Fire would be nothing like its source material. Sure, A Child of Fire has an evil Empire, rebels, and takes inspiration from pop culture and the history of the world, but this is all surface-level. Poke at it, attempt to interrogate it further, and Rebel Moon reveals nothing of substance. But worse than this is that it applies Snyder’s trademark grime and self-seriousness that misses the point entirely. Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire is an introduction to a whole new galaxy, where audiences find themselves on the farming planet Veldt, where the community works and lives harmoniously. One day, the evil Imperium shows up, demanding that the village sell its surplus grain for a seemingly fair price. This offer is refused by the village leader (Corey Stoll with a terrible beard), as before, Kora (Sofia Boutella), a relative newcomer, advised him that the Imperium wants everything. Things inevitably turn sour and the village leader gets his head bashed in by Admiral Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein), who says he will be back in ten months for their next harvest, leaving a garrison behind to make sure this is accomplished.  A Child of Fire has the foundations for an intriguing galaxy, but it never goes beyond this. The film visits many places in which to recruit its many characters, but they’re no more than short vignettes that hint at how interesting a planet could be if more time was spent developing it. There are worlds with glorious cliffs, polluted mines, and even a world with a gladiatorial colosseum, but none of them feel like places, just planetary backdrops for the film to stick characters on for Kora to then whisk away on her quest.  With Snyder at the helm, it’s unsurprising his trademark style is present, except it’s dialed to 11. The atmosphere is thick with grime alongside an overbearing sense of self-seriousness, and the oppressive slow motion present in nearly every action beat drags it to a crawl. There’s also the over-sexualization of the characters. At the film’s start Kora is pressured to get with a village boy, and two action sequences happen to prevent rape. It’s an attempt at edginess, but it’s just crude. This hints at the fact that this was an R-rated film since there’s also an obvious lack of blood from action scenes — something has been held back for a Snyder Cut, an expected element to please the man’s fanboy cult. It’s this dark and grungey tone that strangles out a sense of happiness, a feeling conveyed by Kora herself in one of her exposition dumps. There is an attempt at the theme of found family (something that Star Wars is built upon) but the characters are too wrapped up in their own personal dramas to build upon this idea. Characters are also introduced and then quickly folded into the wider ensemble, preventing any meaningful connections from forming. Hopefully, this is something that can be improved upon in Rebel Moon: Part Two – The Scargiver. One of the more interesting parts of Star Wars, and sci-fi in general, is its ability to take parts of real-world history and current politics and use them to influence their worlds, to comment on society and history. Rebel Moon does this in a superficial sense, with its evil colonist empire inflicting its will on the galaxy. It’s also very much modeled on the Roman Empire, with the Senate, names of Admiral Atticus Noble and Regent Balisarius, and their overall attire. But this goes no deeper.  There is no clever criticism of Western Powers or comment on modern politics that might make the audience think about the situation around them and reflect on their world. Sci-fi doesn’t always have to be this, but the deeper imagery and themes it can inspire are absent, and this is disappointing for a film that wants to follow in the footsteps of Lucas’ work. Snyder certainly watched some Star Wars films — some of A Child of Fire’s locations are ripped right from Lucas’ galaxy — but overlooks their political purpose entirely.

"Dec 22, 2023",negative,Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire just circles around the same pattern...
"Dec 22, 2023",negative," “American Fiction” is the directing debut of “Watchmen” series writer Cord Jefferson. In this adaptation of Percival Everett’s 2001 novel “Erasure,” Jeffrey Wright plays an uncompromising and frustrated novelist named Thelonious ‘Monk’ Ellison. The story follows Monk as he takes a forced “sabbatical” to care for his ailing mother (played by Leslie Uggams). When his latest book doesn’t sell, Monk writes, under a pseudonym, an offensive and exploitative tome that he’s sure will be lampooned. When the book is a runaway hit, the confused Monk must cope with his secret success while balancing the emotional crises in his life. Seeing where Monk’s grand charade takes him is funny and provocative, as publishers go crazy for the book and Hollywood comes calling. This pitch-perfect combination of dry, observant satire and relatable family drama elements is one of the most accessible end-of-the-year awards contenders. The performances are top-notch, with Jeffrey Wright a lock for an Oscar nomination. The attractive supporting cast features terrific work by Sterling K. Brown (who crushed it in the highly recommended “Biosphere” earlier this year). Director Michael Mann (see “Heat”) worked for 20 years to bring this passion project to the big screen. The film, a biopic about Enzo Ferrari, is a dull telling of events in the summer of 1957 when the Ferrari empire was in jeopardy. In “Ferrari,” Adam Driver plays the middle-aged Italian automobile entrepreneur. When his top spot in racing and high-end sports car manufacturing is threatened, Enzo pushes his team ever-harder to win. Meanwhile, the relationship with his tough-as-nails wife Laura (Penélope Cruz) is deteriorating, as details about his affair and child with Lina Lardi (Shailene Woodley) are revealed. While some viewers have noted the distracting computer-generated effects related to the showy automobile crashes, I found them shocking and exciting. But the drama and industrial intrigue came off as limp and unengaging. And the final race sequence seemed strangely detached from the rest of the narrative, as I struggled to understand how all of Enzo’s efforts on the racetrack managed to save his business kingdom. Performances are uneven, as Driver does his level best to look stern and maintain character with a sometimes-shifting Italian accent. Cruz gets the juiciest role and does the finest work in the film, while Woodley is miscast and never finds her character’s center. Cast: Fantasia Barrino, Taraji P. Henson, Danielle Brooks, Colman Domingo, Corey Hawkins, Phylicia Pearl Mpasi, Halle Bailey, Ciara, Gabriella Willson “H.E.R.,” David Alan Grier, Jon Batiste, and Louis Gossett, Jr. This handsomely made second cinematic adaptation of Alice Walker’s seminal novel struggles to justify its existence while also trying to separate itself from Steven Spielberg’s arguably perfect 1985 classic. The musical elements give this new production an added boost, but for those schooled in Spielberg’s film, it’s hard not to attribute the emotional feelings to nostalgia. The story focuses on Celie (played as a teen by Phylicia Pearl Mpasi and as an adult by “America Idol” winner Fantasia Barrino), who is forced to marry the cruel Mister (Colman Domingo). We see Celie grow up under Mister’s oppressive rule, which involves sending away her beloved sister, Nettie (played as a teen by Halle Bailey and as an adult by Ciara). Isolated and abused, Celie must cope with years of mistreatment until she is visited by singer Shug Avery (a terrific Taraji P. Henson). But this new friend might only make Mister’s cruelty worse. While Barrino is the lead, she is overshadowed by supporting performances. Danielle Brooks plays the straight-talking Sofia, a character previously played by Oprah Winfrey, who received an Oscar nomination in 1986. Part of Barrino’s problem is that the script requires her to be defeated until a critical turning point. But in the Spielberg film, Whoopi Goldberg conveyed more in her quiet and trembling calm than Barrino can muster. Of course, Barrino’s singing voice is strong and blends well with the rest of the spirited cast led by the showy and infectious Brooks, who, like Oprah, understands the demands of playing the tragic Sofia. But the musical theatricality, which involves fantasy sequences akin to the Broadway show upon which this is partially based, undercuts the gritty drama that undergirds Alice Walker’s mature source material. And where Spielberg’s film hit us hard with Celie’s despair and Sofia’s complete meltdown, director Blitz Bazawule plays things a bit too cheery. At well over 2 hours in length, the song and dance numbers weigh down narrative coherence. Cutting a few of these sequences, especially ones that don’t appear to have a plot purpose, could have made those that remain even more significant. But several numbers are stunning, like a scene when Shug arrives at the bayou honky-tonk aboard a boat and a fantasy sequence that has Celie belting while being surrounded by men on a chain gang. Wrestling fans might find “The Iron Claw” moving. But this abridged telling of the cursed Von Erich family isn’t the transcendent take on the sport it could have been. The story follows three brothers who became professional wrestlers in the 1980s. While the outcomes of their matches are all predetermined, the action in the ring is the product of careful training and athletic prowess. We meet the Von Erich patriarch Fritz (a very good Holt McCallany) as he moves from the ring to wrestling management. His goal is to make his beefy boys into stars, even if they have no desire to wrestle. The eldest, Kevin (a more muscled-up than normal Zac Efron), is tapped for greatness, but despite having the brawn, he struggles mentally to convey television charisma. David (Harris Dickinson) moves up in the ranks and is joined by former Olympic hopeful Kerry (“The Bear’s” Jeremy Allen White). The three men make a fierce and competitive presence, gaining notice from other leagues, who are always clamoring for talent. But the pressures to perform exact a horrible price, and the curse of the Von Erich family is their legacy instead of their achievements on the mat. This movie story casts aside steroid use, only showing it briefly, and ignores entirely one of the Von Erich brothers. Writer/director Sean Durkin’s dour handling of a notable, high-profile American tragedy fails to break through, even though performances (especially from a devoted Efron) are strong and the wrestling is sometimes exciting. But the problem is partially the sport itself. Professional wrestling isn’t a fake, sweaty activity; the competition isn’t related to who is ultimately declared the winner. Balancing the athletic elements with those related to raw showmanship proves tricky as Durkin’s script turns overly sentimental in the final act. The closing sequences almost seem to be lifted from an inspirational religious film. Lost is the irreverent, often hokey fun associated with the sport, as this vision depicts it as a desaturated damaging wasteland that leaves few unscathed. Where “The Iron Claw” could not figure out how to depict the sport of wrestling, “The Boys in the Boat” might have some viewers hitting the rowing machine. This wholesome and well-made adaptation of Daniel James Brown’s bestselling book is an excellent sports movie. The true story chronicles the efforts of the University of Washington’s rowing team to compete in the 1936 Berlin Olympics. In this Depression-era tale, Coach Al Ulbrickson (Joel Edgerton) assembles a team from open tryouts. Most members, including Joe Rantz (Callum Turner), have never rowed before. But Ulbrickson knows his sport and is committed to molding these young college students into Olympic-caliber athletes. The film has fun showing the process of training and early competitions. And Turner is good as Joe, a loner struggling to pay for school without parental support. Joe’s relationship with boat builder George Pocock (a great Peter Guinness) is the heart of the movie, as the two men are shown bonding while crafting and maintaining the tools necessary to make a run at the gold. Clooney’s conventional directing is just what is required because the story is so inspiring that no amount of tinkering is necessary. And the production design immerses viewers in the time and place. In one sequence, crowds watching a race are shown sitting in stands erected on open train cars that follow the boats along a river. “The Boys in the Boat” won’t likely compete for end-of-the-year prizes, but it’s one of the holiday season’s most pleasing movies suitable for audiences of all ages. Writer/director Andrew Haigh’s odd fantasy romance contains excellent performances from hot actors Paul Mescal and Andrew Scott. The movie has Scott playing Adam, a screenwriter living a lonely existence in an almost abandoned high-rise apartment building. When he begins a relationship with Harry (played by Mescal), the building’s only other resident, Adam explores memories of his parents, who tragically died when he was twelve. The movie’s illusory elements have Adam returning to his family home to discover his mother and father (played by Jamie Bell and Claire Foy) alive and well, as though they haven’t changed in over 30 years. As Adam spends time with his parents, he gets closer and closer to Harry. “All of Us Strangers” is a deliberate narrative that will frustrate some viewers who might consider it a languid horror movie and less a moving drama. “Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire” is like the first draft of a juvenile “Star Wars” fan fiction tome. This comically bad science fiction adventure will remind viewers of other space opera misfires like 2012’s “John Carter” or the Wachowski’s 2015 epic “Jupiter Ascending.” The shame is that for all of director Zack Snyder’s undeniable talent in managing special effect-laden extravaganzas, he has trouble telling a wholly satisfying story. “Moon” started as a “Star Wars” universe pitch. And while there are elements that will remind you of George Lucas’ classic blockbuster, those homages are merely window dressing for a “Seven Samurai,” “The Magnificent Seven” knock-off. Low-budget producing and directing master Roger Corman set those stories effectively in outer space way back in 1980 with the pleasantly entertaining “Battle Beyond the Stars.” Unfortunately, none of Corman’s comic and campy sensibilities extend to Snyder’s take that plays things way too seriously. In “Moon,” former soldier Kora (Sofia Boutella) must assemble a ragtag group of fighters to repel an attack on a peaceful farming village on a distant fertile moon. The risky search brings her in contact with a range of dangerous rebels hunted by the evil ruling class and the disgusting Admiral Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein, in a turn that approaches tongue in cheek but never quite gets there). Unfortunately, Snyder’s script, written with two other screenwriters, fails to understand the need to give each chosen warrior a distinct identity. And they come off as clumsy brutes with little understanding of sophisticated battle tactics. For example, one of their crew members is the revered, supposed genius General Titus (Djimon Hounsou), who demonstrates little military acumen. Kora’s hapless team doesn’t instill the slightest bit of confidence when challenged by the Admiral’s vast forces. It's too bad Snyder didn’t remember what worked for Luke Skywalker and his small but clever X-Wing pilots. To beat an overwhelming threat, you’ve got to outsmart them. “Rebel Moon” proves to be one dim bulb."
"Dec 22, 2023",positive," There's no denying that Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire, which follows a pair of farmers as they seek aid from fighters to make a stand against the space imperials who would rob their village of its harvest, is derivative of other films. Beyond the fact that the film is an obvious Seven Samurai and Star Wars fusion, there's also the fact that Battle Beyond the Stars did the same thing more than 40 years ago. But does that really matter? And if it does, why can't it be a good thing? Like Sucker Punch more than a decade ago, A Child of Fire feels like a playground for story writer/director Zack Snyder to mix and match elements from things he loves in what can just as easily be called a celebration of influences as an uninspired pastiche. Like the multiple fantastical sequences in Sucker Punch, the many planets in A Child of Fire allow Snyder to freely play with varied and seemingly disparate aesthetics. Early on, sleek, dark metal, multiple rocket propelled landing ships of the villainous Motherworld land at protagonist Kora's (Sofia Boutella) adoptive home village that looks very much like the medieval Scandinavian inspired Rohan in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings series. Later a flashback draws on a different city in Jackson's adaptation, the blue gray city of ruins Osgiliath, and fills it with bright red laser gunfire. Another sequence has the aid-seeking characters stop at a classic Western ranch, but instead of horses, the corral is home to a jet black griffin, or rather ""bennu,"" a creature that gives the film its greatest scene of true movie magic wonder when it takes a human character for a ride. There's also an entirely wooden city plucked out of any jidaigeki and a city evocative of the Blade Runner films where the farmers witness one of their recruits battle a humanoid spider monster played with relish by Jena Malone. The only worldbuilding problem with the Rebel Moon universe is one that applies to Star Wars as well: that the main players are all human. When Kora and her companion Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) begin their search for fighters, they visit a bar in the nearest city and as with the Mos Eisley Cantina in Star Wars, A Child of Fire takes the opportunity to show off a variety of creative alien designs. But in both, these imaginatively designed alien characters highlight that the core cast of these films are humans who don't require hours in makeup chairs or hours of post-production to render fantastical. As in Star Wars, those frustrations are forgivable, though, especially when the film delivers on the action that Snyder has become famous for, sometimes comically so. The fights are full of the slow-motion and speed-ramped combat Snyder perfected in 300. The sound for hand-to-hand blows are deafeningly heavy thumps whether the visual calls for level of sonic impact or not. Laser gunfire is even louder and farther down the low end while blade cuts offer some of the sharpest sounding slice sounds accompanied by blood soaring through the air. It's joyously over the top stuff in the best way. Similarly over the top, or at least overly on the nose, is the majority of the dialogue that brings to mind the ""I know writers who use subtext and they're all cowards"" joke. But it's all delivered with such sincerity, both from the very game A-list actors and from Snyder's framing of them as they speak, that it's impossible to be cynical about. Like the aesthetics Snyder's playing with, you can feel his adoration for the narratives he's pulling from and just how seriously he takes their themes of redemption and hope in the face of oppression. That adoration makes it clear that A Child of Fire is a movie from a filmmaker who loves movies and just wants to make movies for other people to love. And we certainly can't hold loving movies against him or the film."
"Dec 22, 2023",negative," Rebel Moon bored the hell out of me. Bored, with a capital “B”. Zack Snyder has made a series of mediocre movies such as Sucker Punch and Army of the Dead. But his latest movie breaks a new record as he hits rock bottom with a so-called epic sci-fi adventure opera that seems like the next big thing. It was a cross between Star Wars and Seven Samurai, where he even originally pitched his idea to Lucasfilm as a standalone Star Wars movie not connected to the Skywalker saga. It didn’t work out as planned. Snyder went to Warner Bros. twice but got rejected before Netflix agreed to his idea and granted him the budget to film a two-part movie event, with the follow-up titled Rebel Moon – Part Two: The Scargiver slated for an April 2024 release date. But till then, the first part of Rebel Moon itself is already DOA. The story goes like this: Kora (Sofia Boutella) is a former Imperium soldier with a dark past who has since laid low on the farming planet of Veldt. Everything looks fine at first until the looming arrival of the Imperium ship above the sky. The soldiers led by the sadistic Admiral Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein) demand all the farming village’s harvested grain and he will return in 10 weeks. To ensure the farmers were doing their jobs, he deployed a small group of soldiers to watch over them. Kora, on the other hand, chooses to leave the place before an incident revolving around an attempted rape of one of the villagers prompted her to kill the soldiers. Soon, with the help of fellow villager Gunnar (Michiel Huisman), the two set out to assemble a ragtag group of warriors as they journey to multiple locations. This includes smuggler and pilot Kai (Charlie Hunnam), beast-tamer Tarak (Staz Nair), cyborg swordmaster Nemesis (Doona Bae), former Imperium general Titus (Djimon Hounsou) as well as warrior Darrian Bloodaxe (Ray Fisher) and his sister, Devra (Cleopatra Coleman). Clocking at 134 minutes long, the movie overstays its welcome long before it reaches the end. Everything here screams clichéd as Snyder shamelessly borrowed and ripped off movies from Star Wars and Seven Samurai to Dune, The Lord of the Rings and even at one point, Inglourious Basterds. I don’t mind the lack of originality in a movie as long as it is entertaining enough to keep me invested throughout the running time. Too bad that’s barely the case for Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire. Snyder’s usual stylised slow motion is on full display but his penchant for employing that effect annoys me more than ever. The action sequences have none of the palpable thrills and high-stakes energy while the story, which Snyder also co-wrote alongside Kurt Johnstad and Shay Hatten, is disappointingly bland from the get-go. There are no emotional and dramatic stakes as Snyder’s self-serious direction sucks the life out of the movie. It doesn’t help either when the protagonist played by the otherwise well-toned and physically fit Sofia Boutella is devoid of any personality. She is nothing more than a depressingly glum former warrior-turned-rebel trying to defend Veldt against the tyrannical Imperium army. It’s hard to care whether her character can make it throughout the journey since the movie strangely forgoes the importance of developing a strong character arc. The same also goes for the rest of the supporting characters, namely Charlie Hunnam’s cut-rate Han Solo-like Kai while Michiel Huisman disappoints with his feeble supporting turn as Gunnar. Then, there’s the scenery-chewing Ed Skrein, whose antagonist role of Admiral Atticus Noble is trying to ape Christoph Waltz’s Colonel Hans Landa-like role from Inglourious Basterds. The special effects are a mixed bag, even though the movie does feature some cool creature designs. There’s a brief but well-choreographed action set-piece between Nemesis’ lightsaber-like double swords against the humanoid spider-like alien Harmada played by Jena Malone. Anthony Hopkins, in the meantime, provides an above-average voiceover role as the sympathetic robot Jimmy. There has been news about the R-rated director’s cut of Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire, which reportedly contains nearly an additional hour’s worth of footage. Whether or not it would be a better version remains to be seen but for now, what we have here is a colossal misfire that I’m not sure it’s worth waiting for the second part next April."
"Dec 22, 2023",negative," It’s time to accept that those “Release the Snyder Cut” t-shirts aren’t aging well. Because as Joseph Campbell taught us, the most important element in any “hero’s journey” is to pick a hero worth following. Writer-director Zack Snyder isn’t that hero. The clumsily-titled “Rebel Moon: Part One — A Child of Fire” is a sci-fi epic crippled by the limits of big budget sci-fi movie imagination. Whatever one thinks of  Mr. “300,” “Justice League” and “Watchmen,” his “Rebel Moon” is corporate content engineering at its most cynical. Campbell’s “Hero of a Thousand Faces” re-iterated the idea that there are only so many plots and basically only one heroine or hero to lead the reader, listener or viewer through them.  It’s a humorless mash-up of “A New Hope” and “The Seven Samurai” (and its Old West remake, “The Magnificent Seven”) a tale of imperialism and brutal repression, with lawless towns and saloons (cantinas), Brit-accented robots, shoot-outs, swordfights and rumors of a “chosen one.” The tech is just a re-jiggering and somewhat more art moderne “streamlined” redesign of all the “rebels” vs. “empire” futurism of every sci-fi movie of the past 50 years.  There are gladiators and bounty hunters and farmers in bib overalls and undisciplined goons as soldiers wearing recycled “American Gladiators” armor, insectoids and humanoid insects and hints of inter-species kink.  Supernaturalism? Fascism? Native mysticism? Fantastic Beasts and where to find them? Sure. They’re mixed-in with gigantic “planet killer” space Dreadnoughts and Ed Skrein as a pasty-faced sadist out to foil a rebellion.  The fights are filled with slo-mo, the cast peopled with generic characters played by actors with skills and just enough cachet to merit their paychecks.  The great Sir Anthony Hopkins voices an empathetic and utterly superfluous robot. Charlie Hunnam is an Irish-accented Han Solo substitute. Djimon Hounsou is a rebel general reduced to gladiatorial combat. And fangirl and fanboy favorite Sofia Boutella of recent installments of “The Mummy,” “Kingsmen” and “Star Trek” is Kora, a space war survivor laying low on a Nordic-accented moon named Veldt, just a farm gal in overalls and a Parisian pixie haircut, waiting for the moment when we learn she is “the most wanted fugitive in the known universe.” All that slo-mo as she fends off occupiers, imperial minions and treacherous locals of every stripe? It’s to minimize the incredubility of the fight choreography.  Kora’s village is visited by soldiers from The Realm who want their harvest. Don’t stop and ponder why this grain-“negotiation” would be carried out at an Eat Local level by a large, armed occupying force. It’ll give you a headache. A murder or two and one vengeful slaughter later, Kora and sweet-on-Kora farmer Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) are off on a quest to find the Rebels, and get some help for their village. As for other help. Toshiro Mifune and Yul Brenner aren’t available. Maybe this general (Hounsou), this sword-slinging vixen Nemesis (Bae Doona), a freed-slave Tarak (Staz Nair) and can be enlisted. In flashbacks, Kora doles out bits and pieces of her past to Gunnar, and we see Cary Elwes as a bearded, uniformed heir to the Romanov crown, the powers of a possible “chosen one” “as prophesied,” and we never for an instant grasp anything resembling “what’s really at stake here.” All these petty crimes against originality wouldn’t matter a whit if Snyder & Co. mashed it all up into something fun or at least more distracting.  I’ve liked some of these actors in other roles. But even with Hunnam’s down’tha pub accident, there is nobody here I’d care to follow down the primrose path of this heroine’s journey, no well-handled action beat that isn’t literally recycled from a thousand other action films and a dozen other “Star Wars” outings. With comic book and “Star Wars” content tumbling into over-saturation and finally losing their cultural currency, the timing of this imitation “galaxy far away” is pretty bad, as well. But maybe “Part Two” of “Rebel Moon” will work better. If not, I’m sure some rocket scientist will start screaming for “The Snyder Cut” soon enough. "
"Dec 22, 2023",positive," Is Zack Snyder a villain or hero? Depending on which corners of the internet you lurk, the filmmaker who served as chief creative architect of the DC Extended Universe (which comes crashing down this holiday season with the lame-duck release of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom) is either the worst thing to happen to Hollywood since Joseph McCarthy or the saviour we’re all too Marvel-pacified to properly appreciate. The truth is of course far less incendiary, or interesting. Basically: the guy is a super-hack, bursting with ideas that are not his own, able to execute them with a façade of flair that evaporates once you look at any one image for longer than a super-slow-mo second. Does this make Snyder’s new Netflix epic Rebel Moon – sorry, Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire, which is being sold as one-half of the first film in a trilogy – an abomination? Hardly. This is instead inimitably watchable trash, the kind of high-gloss nothingness that doesn’t matter unless you really want it to. So highly imitative as to strip the word “derivative” of any meaning, Rebel Moon is fan-fiction writ large, as if Snyder believes he’s outsmarting everyone from George Lucas and George R.R. Martin to the estates of Frank Herbert and H.R. Giger. Perhaps there is a modicum of earned wit in how Snyder goes back to Lucas’s original Star Wars inspiration, Akira Kurosawa’s Seven Samurai, to patch together this story of an outer-planetary farming community that, when threatened by intergalactic colonizers who look an awful lot like space Nazis, enlist warriors from different corners of the universe to defend their homeland. But just because Snyder once pitched Rebel Moon to Lucasfilm as a dark Star Wars spinoff doesn’t make it the genuine article. And yet all the recycled elements are put forward with such deluded bravado by Snyder – and financed with such ridiculously bountiful Netflix resources – that you cannot help but resign yourself to sitting back and letting the guy get it out of his system. My, what a nice little facsimile of the Mos Eisley Cantina you’ve recreated here, Zack! Oh, how clever of you to pit the two actors who traded the role of warrior Daario Naharis on Game of Thrones against one another, with Michiel Huisman playing a brave farmer and Ed Skrein a bloodthirsty space-fascist. And, um, sure, good for you in getting Jena Malone to play a xenomorph-y alien spider who faces off against a lightsaber-wielding Wicked Witch of the West. The descriptions above might make things sound more intriguing than they actually are, but also consider that the charisma-free Sofia Boutella plays a farmland hero whose intensely complicated back story mixes Luke Skywalker with Guardians of the Galaxy’s Gamora. And that British actor Charlie Hunnam adopts the wildest Irish accent ever conceived to play a character who can only be described as “Han Solo, but also an IRA leprechaun?” Do you want to hear about how Anthony Hopkins voices a robot warrior-turned-pacifist named Jimmy? Possibly, but there are only so many hours in the day. Scratch that – there is apparently a black-hole’s worth of inverted time for all things Rebel Moon, given that Part One just barely assembles its heroic team by the two-hour mark. Only Snyder – or perhaps Lucas, James Cameron and Denis Villeneuve – knows what comes next in Part Two: The Scargiver. Or the “R-rated” extended (!) cut that is set to hit Netflix this spring. Bring it on, if you absolutely must. Just don’t expect audiences to champion a space opera they have seen so many times before. We will, however, definitely watch it with one eye (maybe even two) half-open."
"Dec 22, 2023",negative," Whatever the tonnage of the cash-laden trucks that Netflix presumably backed into Anthony Hopkins’ garage before parachuting him in to save the indefensibly dull Rebel Moon at the last moment, it wasn’t enough. The recent Oscar winner has seen it all in his day — he once played a Transformers historian, for Optimus Prime’s sake — but you’d be hard pressed to find a project in which he was as underutilised as he is in director Zack Snyder’s latest eye-sore. Hopkins is literally reduced to an exposition device, in a movie where one character greets another not with a customary ‘hello’, but with, “You’re the legendary assassin known only by the name of Nemesis. Assassinated 16 high ranking imperial officers and their security detail, all in a hunt to avenge your slaughtered children.” What? Even the film’s protagonist, a rebel warrior named Kora (Sofia Boutella), isn’t spared from having to deliver lines like this. In one of her first scenes, she tells her friend, “I am a child of war… the very idea of family was beaten out of me.” They literally live in the same house; did he not know? Snyder is hardly known for his writing — more than his usual visual ticks, the director’s biggest tell is probably getting one of his characters to say the words, ‘the why of’ — but Rebel Moon often feels like a first-draft. It’s uncommonly lousy, even by his standards. The filmmaker might cite respectable influences such as George Lucas and Akira Kurosawa, but you’ll never catch him admitting that Rebel Moon actually seems like it has been cobbled together from the rubble of his nemesis Joss Whedon’s short-lived television series, Firefly. Set in an alien universe ruled by a fascist regime — there’s frankly too much lore to keep track of — the movie opens on a peaceful planet named Veldt. This is where Kora has been living as a farmer for a couple of years, after having been discovered in the wreckage of a spaceship in the aftermath of a war. Unbeknownst to the imperial regime, the citizens of Veldt are living on some of the most fertile farmland in the entire universe. But their cover is blown one day, when a squadron of soldiers arrives unannounced, and demands the entirety of their produce. Ed Skrein plays the commandant, Atticus Noble, as a cross between Colonel Hans Landa from Inglourious Basterds and Captain Russell from Lagaan. In his cruel demands, there are echoes of the Bengal famine, when British colonialists stole from India to feed their people and fund their war, leaving millions dead. Snyder makes the odd decision to portray Kora as a reluctant hero, but after having backed himself into a corner, decides that she cannot remain passive any longer. As expected, Kora turns on a dime and finds the motivation to fight back after witnessing villainy firsthand. It’s disappointing to note that even now — years after being pummeled for the gender politics in Sucker Punch — Snyder relies on violence against women as a narrative trope to propel his plots. In Rebel Moon, Kora kicks into gear only after watching one of her friends nearly get gang-raped by the Nazi cosplayers who serve as the film’s antagonists. Snyder also somehow finds a way to be homophobic in this faraway fantasy land — an impossible feat, you’d imagine, seeing as we’re talking about a world in which Jena Malone plays a humanoid spider-woman. But there you have it. The ugliness of Rebel Moon isn’t limited to its visuals. It’s probably worth pointing out that Kora doesn’t lead the fight against the imperialists herself, but chooses instead to put together a ragtag team of warriors. She is joined on her quest by her suitor, a man named Gunnar (Michiel Huisman), and subsequently by a Han Solo-esque rogue named Kai, played by Charlie Hunnam with, who knows why, a Northern Irish accent. Rebel Moon’s origins as a Star Wars project are apparent. In addition to the shameless use of lightsabers and the Solo stand-in, Snyder also sends his protagonists to a cantina-style hive of scum and villainy, populated by skeevy characters whose faces seem to have been fashioned out of leftover prosthetics from his previous Netflix movie, Army of the Dead. It has been suggested — this is purely speculative, of course — that Netflix tried to reverse-engineer a Release the Snyder Cut-type movement for Rebel Moon. The version of the movie that has been presented to us was edited down from a more sprawling director’s cut, which will no doubt be released in some weeks. If this is true, it has to be the most comically inept decision made by a studio since, well, the Snyder Cut movement itself. Almost unbelievably, Rebel Moon might not be the best film about an armed conflict in a mythical kingdom this week. Indian Army to raise new division with 14,000-15,000 troops for possible deployment in eastern Ladakh. Division to be reorganized from existing personnel and placed under Northern Command. Aims to maintain stable and balanced deployment in entire command theatre and keep strike corps prepared for their roles in J&K and Ladakh."
"Dec 22, 2023",negative," Jason Mamoa returns for possibly the last time as the aquatic DC superhero in “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.” There’s over $200 million worth of eye candy in the story of our hero’s attempt to save the world from Black Manta and global warming….and about $5 worth of originality in the screenplay. It’s a merely adequate aquatic adventure. Emma Stone gives an Oscar caliber performance in the bizarre horror comedy, “Poor Things,” a feminist rethinking of the themes from Frankenstein. It’s bold, original. visually spectacular and very disturbing, with irreverent adult content that barely misses an NC-17 rating. For open-minded audiences, it’s a playfully nutty experience. “The Iron Claw” is one unique bird, an arthouse pro wrestling drama. Zac Efron leads the cast in the true story of the Von Erich clan, a family of grapplers who experienced more than their share of triumphs and tragedies. Its edgy tone may be grating to some viewers, but it’s surprisingly empathetic. File the animated comedy “Migration” under the ‘pleasant surprises’ category. The makers of the “Minions” movies offer a tale about a family of ducks that encounters many dangers when they decide to fly off to Jamaica. It’s a witty, imaginative and fast-moving family feature. Take a Star Wars movie, remove the sense of humor and adventurous fun, and you might have something that looks like the Netflix space opus, “Rebel Moon.” Zack Snyder’s dreary and derivative sci-fi flick is, sad to say, the first in a trilogy. It delivers the action and visuals, but it’s a bloated and humdrum drama."
"Dec 22, 2023",negative," Zack Snyder’s “Rebel Moon — Part One: A Child of Fire” immediately announces its presence as a giant mound of derivative fertilizer in the opening moments, when we hear the clichéd sounds of an Important Story Choir as an intergalactic dreadnought emerges from a Freudian-imagery portal and we get a voice-over telling us about the evil and oppressive Motherworld that is seeking to control the entire galaxy and kill all the rebels, that kind of thing.  Unless this is a parody of “Star Wars,” it looks like we’re in for a long and ponderous, CGI-dominated slog filled with stock characters, slow-mo battle sequences and interminable flashbacks designed to give clarity to a murky and convoluted story. Clocking in at an interminable 134 minutes, “Rebel Moon” devotes an entire movie to the Assemble-the-Team part of the story that usually takes about a half-hour in a typical action film, whether it’s a Western or a heist film or set in outer space. (“Rebel Moon — Part Two, the Scargiver” is set for release on April 19, 2024.) In an unsettling scene in which a group of soldiers attempt to gang-rape a local girl, a hero arises in the form of Sofia Boutella’s Kora, a newcomer to the village who as it turns out is a legendary warrior with a complicated past that she keeps having to explain in extended flashback sequences. After Kora wipes out a dozen or so soldiers, it’s on: She has no choice but to lead the rebellion against the Motherland. Time to draft a team of warriors! Charlie Hunnam is the Han Solo-esque mercenary starship pilot Kai; Djimon Hounsou is a hard-drinking gladiator who was once the great Gen. Titus; Staz Nair is Tara, a fierce and noble imprisoned warrior who gains his freedom by taming and riding a hilariously cheesy-looking giant griffin, and Doona Bae is the cyborg sword master Nemesis, whom we meet while she’s doing battle with an enormous spider-humanoid (poor Jena Malone!) who has kidnapped a child because she’s mad about her infertility, I kid you not. There’s also Cleopatra Coleman and Ray Fisher as the sibling rebel leaders Devra and Darrian Bloodaxe, who sport such elaborate badass looks that it must take them like three hours every morning to do hair and makeup. All this recruiting takes us from one planet and outpost to another, most of them rendered in murky and unconvincing fashion. We feel we’re more in Green Screen Land than outer space. We’d be remiss not to mention the main villain in “Rebel Moon,” the psychopathic and sadistic Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein), who wears a uniform with distinct Third Reich influences and sports a haircut that indicates he might be a big fan of Jim Carrey’s look in “Dumb and Dumber.” What a drooling, creepy, evil weirdo.  “Rebel Moon” ends with the promise, or maybe it’s a threat, of a great and final battle to come. In April. Whether we want it or not."
"Dec 22, 2023",negative," ¿Alguna vez has tenido un amigo que te quiere contar como haría una película de Star Wars? Y cuando le preguntas, te tiene horas diciendo como sería su versión bien “cool”. No solamente conozco gente así, yo he sido ese amigo, por lo que me disculpo con quienes hayan tenido que aguantar mi diatriba, porque esta vez me tocó a mí recibirla de Zack Snyder con Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire. Pero, ¡esperen!, no solamente Star Wars, sino Aliens, Star Trek, Avatar, Flash Gordon, Dune, y cuanta otra historia de ciencia ficción a la que humanamente pudo hacer referencia en esta insípida mescolanza, con todos los defectos de Snyder, con pocas de sus fortalezas. Snyder es ese amigo que te ha dejado “guindando” últimamente, pero le sigues dando la oportunidad porque recuerdas los buenos momentos (300, Watchmen, Dawn of the Dead) que pasaron juntos. Sofia Boutella interpreta a Cora, el único personaje que recuerdo su nombre, porque los demás funcionan como estereotipos que hemos visto mil veces; desde “la asiática misteriosa”, hasta el “nativo americano espiritual” y otros que apenas valen la pena mencionar porque ninguno tiene algún dejo de desarrollo. Ocurriendo en un universo donde un malvado imperio invade planetas para robarle recursos, Cora viaja el cosmos buscando un ejército que le ayude proteger su pequeña villa adoptada pero, termina descubriendo una conspiración mayor de lo que esperaba, relacionado a su propio pasado. Algunos momentos aquí y allá nos recuerdan porque Snyder amasó fanaticada, con secuencias decentes de acción (plagas, por supuesto, de cámara lenta) y algunos elementos simpáticos, como hacer los disparos de armas parecer plasma o lava. Rebel Moon podría haber pasado como una sátira de ciencia ficción. No particularmente ingeniosa, pero al menos suficientemente divertida, excepto que Snyder es reconocido por su falta de humor y aquí sencillamente ni lo intenta. En su lugar tenemos el espectro de lo que pudo ser al menos un buen tributo. Véala a su riesgo.

"Dec 22, 2023",negative,"For now, though, it's arguable that Rebel Moon stands as an overloaded space opera that offers too much, too late..."
"Dec 21, 2023",negative," / / / warning / / / I am a sci-fi fan down to my atoms. I read, watch, listen to, and debate it. Thus, this review comes from a place of disappointment as I search for a new sci-fi classic. If you’re sensitive to critiques of your faves, read no further.  I wanted to like it. I’ve been desperately chasing more sci-fi on screen. I want epic adventure from galaxies out there, somewhere (not to be confused with “Somewhere Out There”). Give me SPACE OPERA that moves the multitudes. However, when I left the theater after Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire, I said a little prayer.  It went like this: Jesus, take the reel (the movie reel) or maybe the muses could send us a script doctor to heal this mess.  Rebel Moon Part One should be good. It has all the component parts: a seasoned director, a story based on the Seven Samurai plot engine (Akira Kurosawa, 1954), gorgeous production design, a charming and ‘really really ridiculously good-looking’ cast, and several million stacks in budget. Yet, somehow, what we end up with is a patchwork of sci-fi with no real impetus of its own. I’ll explain what I mean, the story starts on the planet Arrakis, I mean Tatooine, okay a world that looks like a desert but is abundantly fertile, despite its red-parched earth and rocky terrain. I’m not saying this isn’t possible but I am foreshadowing the lack of world-building that would usually give us a clue as to how this land yields abundant crops. The first thing I noticed—after the narrator (Anthony Hopkins) sets up a galaxy torn apart by war, betrayal, and a slain king—was the backdrops. They look like literal landscapes; painted and theatrical. Perhaps this is a love note to the golden age of Hollywood from director Zack Snyder, but it felt overdone and overly accentuated and I kept staring at them thinking: This would have worked nicely on Broadway.  The first person we meet is Kora (Sofia Boutella). She’s out in the fields alone, plowing the land with a horse-like creature that has a huge bony plate on its head. We can tell she’s strong, mentally and physically, wiry and battle-weary. We soon learn we’re in an old-world Scandinavian farming village and the work is hard but the life is good. There’s also a young blonde woman (Savanna Gann), who stands out and later becomes part of the inciting incident that fuels the coming quest. What sets everything off is the arrival of a battleship called The King’s Gaze. Kora nearly freezes in fear because she knows this ship means destruction. It’s from a planet called The Motherworld, an imperial collective led by the tyrant Regent Balisarius (Fra Fee)—the man Kora is running from—and his enforcer Admiral Noble (Ed Skrein). The leader of the village tries to bargain but things go sideways and Kora is forced to reveal her military training. She is lethal and that is good.  However, the village has 10 weeks until The King’s Gaze returns which means Kora is going to need an army of mercenaries to fight them off. With the help of Gunner (Michiel Huisman)—the guy who fumbled the bag in the first place—Kora aims to find The Bloodaxes (Ray Fisher, Cleopatra Coleman) a sister-brother duo who leads the rebellion. But along the way she picks up a rag-tag squad of talented fighters, each with a grudge against the Motherworld (which we find out too late to matter). That’s where the Seven Samurai trope comes in. Much like Lone Wolf and Cub, the Seven Samurai story engine rarely fails, but Rebel Moon – Part One finds a way to flop around uselessly like a goldfish transported to Arrakis. Imagine Dune but for no reason, completely without purpose. We meet each character as though Snyder is a dealer/dungeon master and this is the hand of role-playing cards we’ve been dealt. Kai (Charlie Hunnam) the thief, Nemesis (Bae Doona) the sword master, Tarak (Staz Nair) the noble indigenous prince, Titus (Djimon Hounsou) the fallen general, and Hopkins as Jimmy the Droid—each member of the ‘Band’ gets an intro scene that highlights their special skill and ends with them stating their mantra. But, why did they say yes to protecting the village, what’s going on in their lives, what are their backstories? The movie barely gives you enough thread to string together its relentless stream of massive action set pieces. Rebel Moon plays out like a digital recording of its creators’ dreams, which is mostly a bunch of “You know what would be cool” moments.  For some of you that may not sound bad, but I need storytelling, world-building, and motivation to understand my heroes and to know why I should believe in them. If given a choice, I’d rather watch cut scenes from video games. They have better, more cohesive stories and I know the time I spend watching them will pay off. With Rebel Moon, I kept wondering how many levels I’d have to defeat before I could get the full backstory on a character. I still don’t know, I had a hard time defeating eye-rolls at the dialogue and boredom. If Rebel Moon – Part One had been made in the 80s I might’ve enjoyed it, but we’re way past that now. Or maybe we’re not that far away because you could create a Quiz Podcast out of all the references here: Seven Samurai, Krull, Clash of the Titans, Dune, Star Wars, Pitch Black 2, Gladiator, Harry Potter, John Carter, and many more. Seriously, this movie seems to rely on our knowledge of all the ‘Sci-Fi That Came Before’, as though we should be pulling from a hivemind compendium for context. What is the magic system? Shrug. Is it science-based? IDK. Who was the war with? Maybe the narrator/android said something at some point but I’ll insert another shrug here.  The best parts of this movie are: a betrayal you could only miss if you fell asleep but is still clever on the part of the betrayer; when a bunch of teeth get knocked out and go flying; and the quality of the hair styling and beard-grooming.  When asked my thoughts afterward, I said, “A pointless pile of sci-fi leftovers.” Maybe the fact Rebel Moon was pitched as a Star Wars movie but had to be flipped back to the original idea is what makes this movie such a pretty mess. I’m not sure. I do know I’m not mad, I’m disappointed."

When a peaceful settlement on the edge of a distant moon finds itself threatened by the armies of a tyrannical ruling force, a mysterious stranger living among its villagers becomes their best hope for survival. The one positive Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire (Part Two will be on Netflix next April) going for it is that, even if the sci-fi journey plays like director Zack Snyder (also co-writing alongside Shay Hatten and Kurt Johnstad) pulling from a grab bag of clichés and tropes every five minutes, he is a visionary filmmaker with a general idea of how to weave in aesthetic elements of his entire filmography to provide a slight distinct flair to the familiarity. At times, the imagery feels like Star Wars colliding with Greek mythology, all with the expected unnecessary, nonstop slow motion during action sequences (that typically don’t add much aside from a rare moment where it allows for the filmmaker to home in on some facial emotions, presumably by accident.) The real frustration comes from not just how derivative the narrative is but the uninteresting, simultaneously boring but rushed execution that feels like watching someone play a series of video game mini-side quests rather than a full-on story of building a rebellion team where each member comes across as a fully fleshed out character with motives to understand and emotion to get involved in. Each recruitment sequence is shorter and sloppier than the last, and somehow more random, as if Zack Snyder is trying to shove any sci-fi staple he can think of into the movie (aliens, robots, humanoid spiders, lightsabers, spaceship battles, bounty hunters) without any consideration as to why it should be there or if it’s serving an entertaining or stimulating purpose. One minute, you’re watching a character bond with mystical animals (which feels blatantly plagiarized from Avatar), and then a South Korean swordswoman is taking down a child-murdering spider creature. As for the main plot, it is centered on Kora (Sofia Boutella), a former high-ranking member of Motherworld’s military regime, the Imperium, having escaped that life to hide out amongst a small band of villagers selling their harvest, sometimes to rebels. Kora has a tragic past, at one point working for the sadistic general that murdered her family and entire homeland, rising her way up the ranks to working closely with the King and his young daughter (a much kinder person with the potential to bring some peace back to this galaxy.) One day, a dreadnought appears, led by Admiral Atticus Noble (a shouting, ruthless villain played by Ed Skrein), demanding the harvest for the Motherworld. He tries to cut a one-sided deal where Kora, hiding her true identity with a completely new appearance, is aware that these people don’t stick to their word and will take whatever they want with force. Initially, Kora plots to run away and start anew, knowing full well that this land is about to be overtaken. This also wouldn’t be a Zack Snyder movie without some form of attempted sexual trauma, so Kora decides to stay and fight for the villagers once a group of soldiers (distractingly looking like they are wearing cheap knockoff Halo Spartan armor) threaten to rape a woman, which prompts the first fight sequence brimming with slow-motion and ground- sliding while firing guns. She then sets out on a journey slapped with uninteresting locations and set pieces to assemble the perfect team to defend the land. If anything, the periodic flashbacks to Kora’s time serving the Motherworld make for a more dramatic, thorny story that, unfortunately, isn’t explored much here. This is Part One, so that’s also pretty much all the film amounts to in terms of storytelling. There is some late-game betrayal, one or two revelations that don’t generate much interest in the sequel, and an inconsequential final action sequence. There are small bits of inspired character design and flourishes of excitement, but otherwise, Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire is a tedious stroll through anything and everything you have seen before done better in another sci-fi movie, with no emotional hook or any reason to care about what’s happening on screen. It is bursting with everything and nothing at the same time."
"Dec 21, 2023",negative," Kal-El help us, Zack Snyder believes in himself. Whatever one thinks of his dour, steroidal opuses — the rock-chord operas he pulls from splash panels or his own imagination — the director has the stubborn perseverance of a true artist. Did he give up on his vision when Warner Bros. essentially wrested Justice League away from him? No, he convinced the studio to release a mea culpa, less a director’s cut than a costly rebuke to the creative decisions of those who funded it. Not even the outright cancellation of a project is enough to stop him, apparently: Told that Lucasfilm would not, on second thought, be inviting him to play in its sandbox, Snyder reached for a shovel anyway. As its mouthful of a title reveals, Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire is not, technically speaking, a “Star Wars story.” But it was intended to be one: Snyder originally pitched it as “Seven Samurai with Jedis,” pulling into more explicit focus Akira Kurosawa’s influence on the franchise. Would that be in the patchwork spirit of George Lucas or merely redundant? Either way, Snyder’s off-brand realization of the idea defiantly broadcasts its IP origins with every droid, stormtrooper, and glowing fire sword never referred to as a lightsaber for copyright reasons. It’s a total mockbuster: Star Wars but cheaper and — given the man responsible — grimmer and grayer, too. At least Snyder resists the urge to scroll the opening exposition down the screen, opting instead for solemn voice-over narration, delivered under an ominous Junkie XL score that’s a far cry from the triumphant strains of John Williams. This galaxy far, far away is a feudal star system known as the Motherworld (not to be confused with Motherboxes), caught in the iron grip of an imperial government after the assassination of the king. Parsecs from the seat of power sits a quaint lunar colony, a land of simple but horny farmers introduced via a striking establishing shot that fills the horizon with the loom of a ringed planet. The image recalls both the Old West desert frontier of Tatooine and the paperback covers of sci-fi novels Lucas has probably read. Early into this Netflix time-suck, a warship touches down, depositing a squad of space Nazis — a Third Reich in regalia, haircut, and genocidal impulse. They’re led by Admiral Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein), a smirking Gestapo with a real Richard Spencer look and punchability; if his name telegraphs a primitive irony (let’s just say you could not imagine him played by Gregory Peck), his falsely civil ramping up to murder is vintage Christoph Waltz. One of the more fascinating contradictions of Snyder’s work is the special delight he takes in obliterating fascist bullies, while also adopting a style of rather Riefenstahlian bombast. Commanded to prepare nearly its entire seasonal harvest for the Empire Imperium, the community instead ends up killing the rapist underlings left to supervise — the movie’s first set-piece of righteous, speed-ramped carnage, a Snyder specialty. Kora (Sofia Boutella), a former royal guard laying low in the colony after going rogue, sets out with her casual farmboy lover (Michiel Huisman) to assemble a cavalry of reinforcements. Building the team is a reliably entertaining aspect of any Seven Samurai gloss, and there’s the superficial impression of fun in this episodic stretch, even as Snyder treats it as a license to cherry-pick images and ideas from a library of other blockbusters, including Avatar, Mad Max: Fury Road, Dune, and even Gladiator. Derivative can be okay. The problem with Rebel Moon is that it’s a pastiche leeched of joy, a Star Wars depressed by Snyder’s delusions of grandeur. There’s no range of personalities, no spunky innocent of the Luke variety, or sardonic rogue of the Han stock. Every one of the recruited warriors — an ensemble filled out by the overqualified, under-utilized likes of Doona Bae, Djimon Hounsou, Staz Nair, Ray Fisher, and more — is a Snyderian strong and silent type, an archetypal badass. Even the apparent Toshiro Mifune figure, a mercenary played by Charlie Hunnam, turns out to be less playful than he first appears. In Rebel Moon, the characters have much less dimension than the spare elements of world-building, like a parasitic puppeteer that shows up during the obligatory cantina pit stop or the spindly, robotic capture devices deployed by the bad guys. In both a micro and a macro sense, Rebel Moon moves like vinyl slowed by turntable debris. It takes an interminable 45 minutes at least even to set Boutella’s Furiosa-like fugitive on her way. Is the agonizingly deliberate pace a way to assure that this story will spill into multiple chapters, or is the bifurcation a byproduct of Snyder’s indulgent anti-efficiency, his apparent inability to do genre at traditional feature-length anymore? The man certainly loves to screech action to a crawl. At times, his famed ultra-slow-motion takes on the unmotivated quality of a video setting toggling on and off at random. Must we see villagers toss rice at the velocity of the Flash entering the speed force? Snyder thinks in tableau, perhaps especially since he started serving as his own director of photography. Like most of his work, Rebel Moon has moments of painterly beauty, indebted to the graphic novels he sometimes adapts and the art of ’70s rock albums he presumably spins while conceiving his projects. The One Perfect Shot crowd may well drink up some of the hero-pose, sprawling-alien-planet imagery, particularly on 70mm; Snyder gets a lot of mythic mileage out of placing his characters (including a melancholy, mechanical ronin voiced by Anthony Hopkins, who deserved more screen time) against brilliant vistas. Nearly every shot of the movie could probably function as an enticing Netflix thumbnail or a variant cover for the comic-book adaptation. But no emotional vibrancy or even variation lurks behind the visual grandiosity of this material. Rebel Moon only comes to life when the heroes are seized by wrath and killing in style; when one of them informs another that there’s “a difference between justice and revenge,” you have to wonder if Snyder knows or cares what that difference is. For all that he shaped the last decade of DC movies, he’s always seemed more like one of the Image Comics defectors — a first-rate illustrator and second-rate storyteller obsessed with edginess and rippling masculinity. Like a Rob Liefeld of the big screen, Snyder knows how to make characters look cool but maybe not how to imbue them with soul. And by splitting his newest epic in half, the filmmaker fails to even deliver on the promise of his original pitch; the movie just kind of stops instead of ending, demanding a few more months of Netflix subscription fees before we get to see the presumed defense of the colony, the Kurosawa-does-Rogue–One payoff. Rebel Moon, which comes with the promise of its own future #SynderCut (why not just deliver that from the start?), is already being billed as the beginning of a new multimedia franchise… which seems presumptuous, frankly. The film is proof that Snyder still has the drive to get his vision up on screen, Disney’s authorization be damned. But it also suggests that what’s really twinkling in his eye is another monument to his own cult of personality: a brand new SnyderVerse built atop the rubble of earlier, better science fiction. Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire is now playing in select theaters; it begins streaming on Netflix on Thursday, December 21. For more of A.A. Dowd’s writing, visit his Authory page. Director Zack Snyder had a banner year in 2021, with both a director's cut of Justice League on HBO Max and a Netflix original movie, Army of the Dead, being watched by millions of streaming viewers. And it looks like 2022 will be just as good for the prolific director as he puts together his next film for Netflix. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Snyder has cast Charlie Hunnam, Djimon Hounsou, Bae Doona, and Ray Fisher in a movie not based on preexisting IP called Rebel Moon. Rebel Moon is a sci-fi story that stars Sofia Boutella as a young woman living in a colony near the galactic rim. When a tyrant named Belisarius threatens to overrun the colony with his army, the young woman is dispatched to find warriors on other planets to return with her and defend her people. Essentially it's another remake of The Seven Samurai and The Magnificent Seven. As we head into the middle of April, the TV rankings on Netflix are a bit unusual. Ripley has fallen off quickly after debuting last week, while original series from March, like 3 Body Problem and The Gentlemen, are still among the most popular shows on Netflix. They've just been eclipsed by unheralded series like Files of the Unexplained and Parasyte: The Grey. This week, Netflix has added an animated revival of Good Times, as well as a British drama/comedy called Baby Reindeer. That's not a bad way to go into the weekend, but we're still holding out hope for some stronger Netflix originals before the month is over. In the meantime, keep reading for our complete roundup of the best shows on Netflix right now. If there's anything we live for in the streaming era, it's the weeks where we have more than enough new shows to watch. This week, Amazon Prime Video has dropped all eight episodes of Fallout, which could take up a weekend all by itself. And on Sunday, April 14, HBO and Max are premiering the first episode of The Sympathizer, a miniseries that will likely earn Robert Downey Jr. an Emmy Award next fall. Apple TV+ has also premiered Franklin, a Revolutionary War-era miniseries about Benjamin Franklin's time in France. That show arrived right on the heels of Apple TV+'s Sugar, which premiered last week. And there are still more new shows coming in April.

"Dec 21, 2023",negative," Rebel Moon is what happens when someone is handed unlimited money and complete creative freedom without having anyone around them who is willing to tell them ""no."" When director Zack Snyder was presented with a blank check from one of the biggest streamers in the business and creative freedom, he released Rebel Moon, a film without an original moment in its body to the point that it would be funny if it didn't take itself so incredibly seriously. Director: Zack Snyder
Summary: When a peaceful settlement on the edge of a distant moon finds itself threatened by the armies of a tyrannical ruling force, a mysterious stranger living among its villagers becomes their best hope for survival. Snyder lives the life many creatives would cut off a limb for. The partnership he appears to have with Netflix is the kind that directors spend entire careers hoping they might someday get a fraction of attaining. Someone is giving you whatever resources you need to make your vision a reality, and you don't need to force it into some recognizable IP. You're able to explore original worlds and concepts. It's hard to say how rare it is for someone to be in the position that Snyder is currently in regarding not only Rebel Moon but his Army of the Dead films as well. No one appears to be telling him ""no"" or reigning him in; he has access to anything, so what he has put on screen with Rebel Moon is everything because that's what it is. This film was made under the ideal circumstances for any filmmaker. This is why it is painfully ironic that Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire doesn't have an original bone in its body. When presented with the opportunity to do anything, Snyder decided that copying everyone else's homework in terms of storytelling, character beats, character arcs and even the look of the world was the way to go. There is not a single moment in this film that feels original or fresh. This isn't familiar places with a fresh coat of paint; this is just the same repurposed tropes with some slow motion and decent cinematography, and that's about it. You know these stories because you have seen them before; you know where all of this is going, and Snyder has given zero indication that he will be subverting anything in future installments because the tone of this could not be more serious. There is not a single moment of levity in this entire film, no joy, because, apparently, the only way to be dark is to be joyless. All of this is bad enough and would kneecap any film, but Rebel Moon also has to contend with the fact that it is half a movie and all of the challenges that come with that. When you are half a movie, you are, by design, working under a handicap because you have to make up for the fact that you're not giving your audience a satisfying ending. You have to make up for the fact that most of your film will be set up, worldbuilding, and exposition. You need to excel in everything else to make up for those facts, and Rebel Moon does none of that. It expects you to be fine with 85% worldbuilding, a long, drawn-out backstory, explanations of flashbacks, and gathering of the allies while doing nothing else of interest. As previously stated, nothing is new here; we have seen it all before, and now we see it with the added baggage of not even being a completed movie. Then, there is the issue surrounding the director's cut. Snyder has been nearly bragging that this director's cut will be very different from the first version of the film, as if that is somehow a good thing. This was not dictated by a studio that took a movie and cut it up so it didn't even resemble the original version [see Kingdom of Heaven]; this appears to be something that Snyder wanted to do the entire time. However, suppose this movie is everything, which it very much seems to be because everything is up on screen, and Snyder had the opportunity to do everything. Why is it, under those circumstances, he still couldn't find a consistent throughline for this film? Why are we staring down the barrel of four films [Rebel Moon 1, Rebel Moon 1 – Directors Cut, Rebel Moon 2, Rebel Moon 2 – Directors Cut]? Why was everyone making this film so unsure about where they wanted it to go that they had to make two versions and somehow think that it was something worth bragging about? Director's cuts are not a bad thing, but when that hour of footage changes things to the point that the director himself is saying, ""It's almost like a different movie. It's almost a different universe that [the R-rated cut] lives in than this movie,"" you're left wondering why no one could come up with a definitive direction for this movie that two were necessary. The impressive cast of this film is doing their best with what they are given, but it's hard to become invested in any of these characters when you can see where they are heading five minutes after meeting them. There are several major deaths at the end of the film, and a ""twist"" that was initially teased as a cliffhanger that you could have called five minutes after meeting the respective people involved. It's almost impressive how unoriginal all of this is, to the point that they somehow got an unoriginal-sounding score out of Tom Holkenborg. The best part of the film is the cinematography, but Snyder has always made pretty pretty-looking movies in terms of that, so it would be weird to expect anything less from him at this point. Rebel Moon is what happens when someone is handed unlimited money and complete creative freedom without having anyone around them who is willing to tell them ""no."" Snyder can make good films, but in the last decade, after the cult of fans began to surround him, it's clear he has started to believe the hype and ""do no wrong"" mentality. The only people who think two radically different cuts of the same film is a good idea are the creative way too in love with their own lore and a studio executive who sees it as the opportunity to release a movie twice. This is the foundation that Snyder and his team are building not only a second film on but a new cinematic universe, and much like his version of the DC Universe, it is a fundamentally broken foundation right out of the gate. This weekend, we are witnessing the end of the Snyder era of the DC Universe and how it all fell apart because of that broken foundation while also seeing history repeat itself all over again on Netflix. Unlike Justice League, there is no time to course correct Part Two of Rebel Moon, so this is what they have: a copy of a copy of every science fiction story and Seventh Samurai adaptation that we have seen and nothing more."
"Dec 21, 2023",positive," Rebel Moon begins on the Veldt, a bucolic paradise, where Kora (Sofia Boutella) has crash landed. The community adopts her as she tries to escape her troubled past—but the fascist Motherworld comes knocking when Admiral Noble (Ed Skrein) arrives and demands their harvest. To protect her new home from oppression, Kora must venture into space and assemble a crew to protect the simple farmers and take a stand.  Writer and director Zack Snyder made a name for himself for going big. Rebel Moon goes bigger and farther than any other Snyder project. The film was once pitched as a Star Wars movie and has many parallels to the original George Lucas saga. Where Lucas battled against a shoestring budget and limited special effects, Snyder had the resources to let his imagination run wild. Rebel Moon doesn’t reveal one or two planets. We visit a handful of places, each vastly different from the previous one. Each planet and town has diverse populations of humanoid and non-humanoid creatures. One planet being mined for its resources has a half-spider, half-woman decrying the pollution from over-industrialization. Another planet looks like a dust farm where they are training a Bennu (space griffin). There’s also a peaceful robot named Jimmy (voiced by Anthony Hopkins) that may have turned to animism. The biggest flaw in the film is packing in too much. We already know there is a “part two” on the way, and the first film feels like a big setup for the next step. There isn’t enough time to get to know the characters or develop emotional attachments to them. As they assemble the team, they toss the new characters at you so quickly that you can’t appreciate their uniqueness. Every character, along with their outlandish names, could be their own main character. But why have one person harmed by the Motherworld when you can have a whole team of them? This is a space opera, and Snyder gives it the over-the-top production a space opera needs, with several scenes that subvert tropes in unexpected and hilarious ways. Snyder took the formula and went in a direction that may not make sense to most. It’s space—who’s to say what makes sense? Once again, Snyder proves he is masterful at creating stunning visuals. The film is beautiful to look at. He’s also brilliant at shooting a fight scene. They are always exciting and move like a choreographed dance. Rebel Moon puts the Snyder spin on a space epic and delivers a wild ride from start to finish. It’s not Shakespeare, but it sure is fun."
"Dec 21, 2023",negative,"Rebel Moon might look big and splashy, even on a TV screen, but in terms of working as drama, it’s less a rebel yell than a low-key rebel grunt."
"Dec 21, 2023",negative,Simply registering the title of Zack Snyder’s Rebel Moon — Part One: A Child of Fire takes more time than the film deserves.
"Dec 21, 2023",neutral," It’s hard to know if Rebel Moon—Part One: A Child of Fire’s issues stem solely from its intentional truncation. How much blame can fall on director Zack Snyder, America’s sweetheart, and the embattled visionary behind The Snyder Cut (among other films, too, if you can believe it)? Long before Rebel Moon—Part One: A Child of Fire hit theaters prior to its streaming release on Netflix, it was obvious to those in the know that the film we were going to get was not the real film. Or, it was, but edited down by about 50% and then, seemingly, a little bit more, with scenes skipping merrily along from point A to B with no clear path which connects them; a two-hour-and-13-minute film that feels like five minutes, in a bad way. Characters appear and barely speak (Djimon Hounsou is maybe done the dirtiest in this respect), relationships are forged with little foundation and, somewhere along the way, we’re all meant to not only care about what we just watched, but care enough to watch a second film. It’s difficult to even fault this most pressing issue, when the film that you just watched is both obviously a hack job and explicitly, intentionally made for the sole purpose of Snyder Cut 2.0: The Rebel Moon—Part One director’s cut, Snyder’s actual, intended film, will be released, allegedly, sometime next summer. As explained by Snyder himself, the director’s cut, which will be rated R, is “almost like a different movie”—well, because, it probably is a different movie, based on what I and everyone else has already watched. As of right now, Rebel Moon—Part One: A Child of Fire is less a movie and more a collage of barely-connected scenes. According to Snyder, it was Netflix’s idea to release the movie in two cuts, something he admits he had never experienced before as a director usually compelled to release his own cut after the demand for it presented itself over time. He further explains that Netflix’s reasoning had to do with the scale and cost not being “responsible” with an R rating, which just doesn’t make sense at all when the film wasn’t produced with a meaningful theatrical release in mind; the rating of the film shouldn’t actually matter if it’s just going to streaming. At any rate, here is what Rebel Moon—Part One: A Child of Fire is about, for now. In a universe referred to as the Motherworld, Kora (Sofia Boutella) lives on the prosperous farming planet of Veldt, led by Corey Stoll wearing a fake beard doing a weird European accent, and his horny wife. On Veldt, Kora moves rocks, broods, speaks in platitudes and spurns the affections of handsome, good-hearted farmer Gunnar (Michiel Huisman). Kora was rescued and brought to live there many years ago, after working for and living with the Imperium. The Imperium are a bloodthirsty entity which hops from planet to planet forcing the inhabitants into subjugation, and whose armed forces had slaughtered Kora’s own family when she was a child. But the Imperium finally makes its way to peaceful Veldt, where Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein), the ruler’s right-hand man, carries out a brutal execution and announces his plans to overtake the community. After a bloody altercation, Kora and Gunnar break from Veldt and the Imperium’s presence on a mission to, one might say, “assemble a team” in order to take on the bad guys. It’s weird. While watching Rebel Moon, scenes happen, characters are introduced and speak to one another, things move along. The narrative and visual rhythm are undeniably off, but I can understand what’s happening and why. In the moment, nothing feels terribly egregious. But when you step back, everything suddenly becomes amplified, and you see that Rebel Moon is held together with spit and glitter glue and pipe-cleaners. By the time the credits rolled, I realized I don’t think I’d ever watched a movie this long that still felt so brief and bewilderingly abridged; where so much happened and yet nothing happened at all.  Individually, scenes are often enjoyable enough, like the Star Wars Cantina rip-off scene, or the Harry Potter hippogriff rip-off scene, or the Jena Malone spider humanoid scene—the latter of which might be the best in the whole film. Malone plays Harmada, a grotesque arthropod monster whose home in a mining village was colonized to the extent that she now struggles to bear children. Like Harmada, there are other moments of unpleasant body horror; a patron at the Not Cantina who relays info to Kora and Gunnar is a netherworldly creature with tentacles affixed to a man’s body, using him like a puppet to speak. But as to be expected in a PG-13 movie meant for an R rating, it’s all missing something more. It’s annoying to know that we’re going to get it, and that it’s been withheld from us for nonsensical reasons. There’s a story here, but all we have right now is a corkboard covered in photos tacked on with pins and connected by a series of strings. And yet, is the story that Snyder gave us going to be any better with nearly two more hours appended? Rebel Moon—which the director began cooking up when he was a child—was explicitly intended as a Star Wars project, before his pitch to Lucasfilm went bust and Snyder was forced to go back to the drawing board…and it feels it. Like George Lucas, Snyder took inspiration from Akira Kurosawa. There’s a chosen, orphaned warrior destined to save the galaxy, a snarky pilot they need to help them, a fascist movement seeking galactic domination: What does the “Imperium” sound similar to?  Yet it’s all missing the juice of the Star Wars universe—not terribly surprising, even as a part-time Snyder apologist myself. Acting as his own cinematographer (as he did for Army of the Dead), Snyder’s scenery is as dour and neutral-toned as ever, alternating between gorgeous setpieces like the Harmada sequence and a truly overbearing lack of imagination or visual flair for a movie that’s billed as a space opera. The action and violence, Snyder’s notorious wheelhouse, are full of his usual trademarks but boring to look at and poorly paced. And on top of the iffy visuals and even iffier story, every character seems woefully miscast, aside from Skrein’s Cosmic Hitler Youth. Boutella excels in fight scenes and she can be an incisive presence, but she doesn’t have the charm to be what is essentially a female Luke Skywalker. Her lines fall flat, spoken like she wants to will gravity into them. In her defense, they were written flatly. And who the hell gave her that fuck-ass bob in space? Towards the end of Rebel Moon—Part One: A Child of Fire, after the epic battle has been fought and won, Hounsou’s character delivers the perfect victory monologue and says that their situation feels like it’s “the beginning of something.” He might as well have turned to the camera and said, “Stay tuned for Rebel Moon—Part 2: The Scargiver, streaming on April 19.” I admire Zack Snyder, partly because he’s a difficult guy to dislike and primarily because he’s ambitious, confident and singular in his artistic vision, even when it doesn’t always work for me (and for many, many other people). I’m a huge fan of Watchmen, I really enjoy Army of the Dead and 300, and all his DCEU installments make me want to kill myself (but his Nick Cave needledrops in Zack Snyder’s Justice League are legendary). Artists are more interesting when they’re divisive, and some might say Snyder’s career has become defined by that word. Whether or not the extended version of Rebel Moon is much of an improvement on the initial version, I’ll always be eager to see what kind of division Snyder’s cooked up next—it’s just disappointing to see his work cheapened by Netflix meddling. It’s clear that the savvy geniuses over at Netflix Incorporated were eager to cash in on the frenzy of the Snyder Cut phenomenon by manufacturing their own in Snyder’s epic space opera. Of course, as other studios will likely realize once they try to artificially replicate the success of “Barbenehimer”—which we all know they absolutely will—corporations cannot replicate the organic fan momentum of grassroots social media movements like “Barbenheimer” or “Release the Snyder Cut” (no matter how toxic the latter has proven to be). There’s no zealous demand for “Release the Snyder Cut: Rebel Moon—Part One: A Child of Fire” and not just because the title is far too many words. We all know that it’s already coming. It’s cheap. It’s being handed to us willingly. It wasn’t won after a hard-fought battle. It wasn’t made by the people, for the people—it was made by Ted Sarandos, and who the hell wants that?

"Dec 21, 2023",negative," El polémico director Zack Snyder está de regreso, en esta ocasión con la primera parte de Rebel Moon: “La niña del fuego”. En esta nueva obra original del cineasta, conoceremos la historia de Kora (Sofia Boutella), una joven y audaz guerrera, quien, después de que su pueblo es atacado por un ejército tirano, en busca de conquistar sus tierras, se enfocará en reunir a una plantilla de guerreros forajidos para hacerle frente al inesperado altercado. No es ningún secreto el empeño y dedicación que Snyder pone a cada una de sus producciones. Es evidente el amor que el realizador siente por su trabajo y el respeto que tiene por cada integrante de su equipo. No por nada, sus actores siempre se muestran felices y agradecidos con él, y constantemente es algo que expresan en entrevistas y conferencias de prensa. Por desgracia, nada de esto resulta suficiente para que Rebel Moon se convierta en una extraordinaria cinta de ciencia ficción. Esto, pese a que sí cuenta con algunos momentos memorables. Podríamos decir que Rebel Moon es todo lo que se esperaría de un filme de Zack Snyder… tanto para bien, como para mal. Empecemos abordando el lado amable de la cinta. Y es que, lo que es más digno de aplaudir aquí, es la tremenda calidad visual que maneja el largometraje. Es muy probable que “La niña del fuego” obtendrá múltiples nominaciones, en diversas ceremonias de premios, por sus grandiosos efectos generados por computadora. Su fantástico CGI nos permite ser parte de un hermoso espectáculo inmersivo, que deleita a la pupila y nos transporta directo al campo de batalla. Por instantes, se siente como si nos adentráramos a un videojuego de acción, en primera persona. A su vez, el diseño sonoro también destaca de sobremanera, ya que da apertura a una experiencia sensorial. Logra envolver en su totalidad al espectador, y lo vuelve partícipe del conflicto bélico. Asimismo, el score, a cargo de Tom Holkenborg (quien ya ha trabajado con anterioridad al lado de Snyder) da pie a la creación de un ambiente épico, cuyos matices heroicos despiertan una constante sensación de valentía e intrepidez. Es una tristeza que la película no vaya a tener exhibición en cines, para poder apreciar al máximo su grandeza audiovisual. El desarrollo de los personajes es plano y escaso (por no decir nulo). Mientras que conocemos información sobre el pasado de nuestra protagonista, Kora, todo se aborda de forma superficial, a modo de flashbacks, en pocos minutos. Debido a ello, no nos terminan por quedar claras sus motivaciones, más allá de su deseo por salvar y vengar a su gente. De esta manera, resulta predecible el trato que sufren el resto de los personajes. Todos lucen atuendos vistosos, tienen personalidades muy contrastantes y poseen habilidades diferentes, cualidades que dan como resultado a un equipo de guerreros bastante llamativo. Sin embargo, poco nos interesa lo que suceda con ellos, ya que el largometraje no se preocupa, en lo absoluto, en darnos un trasfondo sobre cada uno de los personajes. Sólo se nos dan migajas de información, por lo cual, es imposible conectar y empatizar con ellos. Por otro lado, el tan característico uso excesivo de la cámara lenta, por parte de Snyder, por supuesto que está de regreso. Si bien las diversas tomas en slow motion nos brindan la oportunidad de apreciar a detalle el bello diseño de vestuario y producción, la repetición tan continua de este recurso termina por generar cierto hartazgo. Escenas que buscan ser épicas, caen en un melodramatismo que raya incluso en lo ridículo y risible. La cinta se toma demasiado en serio a sí misma, y esto puede resultar en algo pretencioso, que saca de sintonía al espectador. Rebel Moon: La niña del fuego cumple su propósito principal como filme de acción. Nos proporciona una buena dosis de secuencias explosivas, para disfrutar con una cubeta de palomitas, y logra entretener al público por más de dos horas. No obstante, el desarrollo y el desenvolvimiento que tiene la historia deja mucho que desear. Es difícil que la situación pueda mejorar para la secuela, pues las bases ya han sido planteadas. Esta película, sin duda, será una que los fans de Zack Snyder amarán y defenderán, mientras que al resto de los espectadores muy probablemente los dejará con un sabor de boca agridulce.

"Dec 21, 2023",negative," Once a discarded pitch for a Star War, now even before it’s released an already-truncated first half of an eventually-six-hour techno-fantasy epic, Zack Snyder’s Rebel Moon — Part One: Child of Fire offers its creator a massive canvas, almost unlimited resources, and promises the primary influence of no less than Kurosawa’s Seven Samurai. And yet, it’s the worst-case scenario of that potential: a hopelessly derivative, technically awkward, clumsily expository half of a movie. So, apparently, there was a fascist galactic empire that lasted for thousands of years, razing and pillaging world after world and subjugating their peoples. But then one day some even worse fascists staged a coup, took over, and blamed the whole thing on insurgents who had already been fighting the first set of marginally nicer fascists. Now, those bad guys — The Motherworld — have come to the peaceful farming world of Veldt, like the bandits in Seven Samurai, to steal the grain from this one village. And so, it falls to Kora (Sofia Boutella) to seek out warriors from around the galaxy to help the farmers make a stand against the evil Admiral Noble (Ed Skrein) and his troops. What follows is scene after scene of endless plot and character exposition, as our heroine and her cadre of cohorts hop from planet to planet gathering help. There’s rogue-ish Kai (Charlie Hunnam), slave Tarak (Staz Nair), miserable swordswoman Nemesis (Bae Doona), and so on and so forth. It’s at roughly the halfway point that viewers will start to wonder if Djimon Honsou is going to show up as a grizzled warrior (don’t worry, he does). Each one of these players is granted a lengthy showcase scene, like taming a wild giant bird or fighting a deadly spider-lady with what were at some point in this film’s life probably lightsabers. Between character introductions, Kora gives one speech after another delineating her backstory; at one point she even says, “I’m telling you this so you know who I am,” which it’s tough to imagine isn’t an intentional joke. Sadly, it isn’t. Throughout all of this explication of character Snyder insists on the idea that they’re all escaping from some central trauma — something he clearly believes in full is the ultimate project here — but it’s all treated with such blunt obviousness that you can guess the stories before they’re even told. One longs for a story that allows its archetypes to tell their stories through action — being who they are rather than explaining it. The worlds these characters inhabit are also woefully under-imagined; over here is a familiar desert world, over there is another dank evil empire spaceship populated by bad guys with vaguely British accents, and then there’s yet another industrial dystopia. One world is even just a green-screened backdrop of blue clouds. There is admittedly some cool creature design — the aforementioned spider-lady (played by Jena Malone), a squid-faced regent, a little bug parasite that sucks its victims’ brains out while it puppeteers them — but most of our lead characters are blandly human. It’s enough to wonder why the sword-wielding badass couldn’t at least have four arms or something. At least all this plot is welcomely broken up by Snyder’s action, punctuated by his trademark speed-ramped tableaux. There’s a remarkable clarity to it as always, and he’s working as his own DP here — as he did in the equally misbegotten Army of the Dead, but here with much less handheld — and he offers his cast the chance to finally shut their mouths and get to work doing what they were hired for: to look awesome posing. It’s clear that the violence, and therefore the cutting, has been defanged to get a lighter rating, but there’s still a frankness to the bloodshed that is too often missing from stuff like this. That said, it’s unclear that another hour of story will be worth slogging through to get some extra action. Rebel Moon is clearly full of enthusiasm and fueled by earnestness, but Snyder is totally lost in the weeds, especially regarding the needless promise of so, so much more of what already doesn’t work here. For all his sincerity, he’s poured his heart into something that’s just… air meat. DIRECTOR: Zack Snyder;  CAST: Sofia Boutella, Djimon Hounsou, Ray Fisher, Bae Doo-na, Ed Skrein;  DISTRIBUTOR: Netflix;  IN THEATERS: December 15;  STREAMING: December 21;  RUNTIME: 2 hr. 15 min."
"Dec 21, 2023",neutral," His newest project, a collaboration with the streaming service, Netflix, had been germinating in his brain for a decade before he was able to film it.  Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire, had a limited theatrical release last week before making its way to Netflix just in time for the holiday weekend. Years after the King (Cary Elwes; The Princess Bride) and his niece, Princess Issa (Charlotte Maggi; Summer Love) were murdered, The Motherworld is ruled by a dictator, Balisarius (Far Fee; Hawkeye), who has created a seemingly unstoppable empire.  Meanwhile, living a peaceful life as a farmer on a planet called Veldt is Kora (Sofia Boutella; Atomic Blonde), a former high-ranking Imperium soldier who looks to bring together an army of rebels to fight Balisarius' henchmen when they threaten the people of Veldt. Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire is unquestionably Snyder, with his slow-motion sequences and action-driven plot.  He also draws out some scenes to the point of ad nauseam but one can't expect anything less from a director who made a four-hour film for Warner Bros.  However, within the 133-minute runtime, there are some excellent scenes while there are also some that miss the mark.  For example, when Balisarius interrogates Admiral Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein; Deadpool) after he loses a battle to Kora and the Rebels, the dialogue could have been truncated to the same outcome. Boutella is no stranger to stunt fighting having portrayed strong yet villainous women in previous roles.  She adds a layer to her strong performance by not only showing off her action skills but by also offering a sense of humanity and heart to a hardened and fierce warrior.  She is matched in her intensity by Skrein and the two offer one of the better battle scenes in the film.  Charlie Hunnam (Sons of Anarchy), Michiel Huisman (Game of Thrones), and Djimon Hounsou (Guardians of the Galaxy) all do a fine job providing emotional moments for Boutella to feed off of. The rest of the cast is hit or miss with some fine performances intertwined with mediocre ones. Where Snyder is really at fault is in the pacing of Rebel Moon.  While it should be a cohesive story, it instead reads like a television show with each subplot having a clear beginning and ending in which to interlace some commercials.  It makes for a choppy feeling overall that takes the viewer in and out of scenes, which is very distracting. The CGI is also awful, looking amateurish and as if it were produced on older equipment. Conversely, the fight scenes are impressive and well-choreographed.  For example, when Nemesis (Bae Doona; Cloud Atlas) fights the spider creature, their entanglements seem like tango as they dance around the room. There are also some interesting weapons including Nemesis' swords that can be set on fire to increase the damage they can inflict on an enemy. Rebel Moon, drawing inspiration from anime and Star Wars, was initially pitched as a Star Wars film in the 2010s to Disney. However, its disjointed plot segments hinder smooth scene transitions, falling short of its influences.  Unfortunately, Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire isn't going to translate into a triumphant return to film for Snyder and doesn't remotely resemble his earlier creations like The 300 and Man of Steel. Hopefully either the R-rated director of cut or Rebel Moon - Part Two: The Scargiver will clarify the story more.

"Dec 21, 2023",negative," Oddly, for a movie that’s rated PG-13 and often plays like a young-adult fantasy, Zack Snyder’s “Rebel Moon — Part One: A Child of Fire” features at least two attempted sexual assaults and a queasily erotic encounter between a shirtless man and a many-tentacled alien. The film’s most thorough violation, though, is of its cinematic bloodline: To call “Rebel Moon” a “Star Wars” pastiche — with a dash of “Dune,” a lick of “Lord of the Rings” and a whole heap of “Seven Samurai”— is both glaringly accurate and somewhat redundant. In today’s fantasy-verse, derivativeness is virtually a given. Snyder has long been open about his influences, and has been imagining this crossbreeding of mythologies since he was in college. Somewhere in a distant galaxy (you know how far away) floats a peaceful planet called Veldt where burlap-clad villagers till the soil and mind their own business. A fascistic empire known as the Motherworld has other ideas, sending its representative, Admiral Atticus Noble (a scenery-scarfing Ed Skrein), to demand grain for its army. Brazenly channeling Ralph Fiennes’ character from “Schindler’s List” (1993), Atticus sports bowl-cut bangs, an S.S.-style uniform and a really big stick; so after he promises to return and slaughter the villagers if grain is not forthcoming, finding a savior is on top of everyone’s to-do list. Enter Kora (Sofia Boutella) a mysterious outsider with a secret past, an ultraflexible spine and an expression that splits the difference between ticked-off and smoldering. Kora has her own reasons to seek revenge on the Motherworld; accordingly, accompanied by the gentle Gunnar (Michiel Huisman), a confrontation-averse villager who looks at Kora the way your dog eyes your dinner plate, she embarks on a planet-hopping quest to round up fellow rebels. Essentially a getting-the-gang-together movie, “Rebel Moon — Part One” (the conclusion, one hopes, follows next April) allows each insurgent a showy set piece and a line or two of grudge-filled back story. Among these is Charlie Hunnam as the rascally Kai, a Han Solo stand-in and the sole cast member with a jot of personality; Bae Doona as a master swordswoman with lightsaber forearms; and Staz Nair as a hunky creature whisperer. The movie’s most fun and flawless performance, though, comes from Jena Malone as a monstrous spider-woman who kidnaps small children. Her design cribs shamelessly from a “Doctor Who” character, but Malone gives her an Alice Krige-as-the-Borg Queen energy that’s creepily effective. Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

"Dec 21, 2023",positive," Zack Snyder's ""Rebel Moon"" is a cornball space adventure that's like ""Star Wars,"" ""Lord of the Rings,"" ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and a few dozen other signposts — a little bit of ""Star Trek,"" a dash of ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" a hint of ""Starship Troopers"" — all rolled into one. To its credit, it borrows from a solid slate of sources, and while it's highly derivative, it's also highly watchable. Its referential nature helps it clip along at an expedient pace, and while it never feels like you're watching something new, it at least feels like you're watching something familiar. ""Rebel Moon"" is like coming home. In the movie — its full cumbersome title is ""Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire,"" and yes, a Pt. II is due out in April — a peaceful group of farmers on a far off moon known as Veldt is raided by an evil group of space Nazis known as the Motherworld. Its commander, Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein, appropriately dastardly, like if ""Inglourious Basterds'"" Col. Hans Landa was played by Cillian Murphy) wants the planet's crops and puts everyone on notice: He'll be back in 10 weeks, and he expects a full bounty. Clock is ticking. Kora (Sofia Boutella), an ex-Motherworld soldier, leads a resistance against the tyranny, and along with Gunnar (Michiel Huisman), a Veldt farmer, she cruises around the galaxy to gather up a team to take a stand against the bad guys. This is where ""Rebel Moon"" picks up steam as the pair visits planets with names like Daggus and Moon of Pollux, the latter of which sounds like an '80s goth band, in side missions that feel like tiny episodes inside the larger whole. It moves so quickly that at one point Snyder stages an elaborate fight between a swordsmith (Doona Bae) and a spider-lady (Jena Malone) whom we've barely even met. Wait, who are these two again? But the point is ""Rebel Moon"" moves, and its stakes are always clear. Charlie Hunnam plays a mercenary who joins the squad, same with Staz Nair, who plays an imprisoned blacksmith who tames a giant beastly blackbird creature in the film's most purely entertaining sequence. Djimon Hounsou plays a warrior the crew picks up along the way, while Sir Anthony Hopkins voices a C-3PO like robot who stays back on Veldt while the gang visits different planets. (He probably should have tagged along on the journey, they could have used his banter.) Snyder shoots in heroic low angles, pulling from his own ""300"" playbook, while also either nodding to or ribbing J.J. Abrams — it's unclear which — by employing an overabundance of lens flares. We know where ""Rebel Moon"" is headed, and there aren't many surprises along the way. But it's never dull, and this dubstep space opera knows when to drop the beat."
"Dec 21, 2023",negative," It’s not Zack Snyder’s original—I use that term sarcastically—Rebel Moon: Part One: A Child of Fire is too long and leaves the story with no real closure or ending, which you should always keep in mind for the audience. The script offers minimal character in terms of development despite endless exposition minutes going nowhere. For all its epic scope and world-building, Rebel Moon is a vain and hollow attempt at a love child “throupling” of grandeur adventure films such as Star Wars, The Matrix, and the Indiana Jones franchise that tests your patience immediately after the first act. Not to mention abandoning an exciting theme of artificial intelligence. Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire‘s story follows Kora (Sofia Boutella), a beautiful farmhand with a secret. Kora lives peacefully on the independent planet of Veidt with her inner circle, a father figure in Hagen (A White Day’s Ingvar Sigurdsson), and love interest Gunnar (Michiel Huisman), the community’s expert agriculturalist. Well, Kora’s past is about to catch up to her. On the day of the harvest on Veidt, a planet with rich soil, the notorious Imperium forces visit. Led by the evil Atticus Noble (Midway’s Ed Skrein), they take over the earth, forcing the residents to work and giving them their only food supply, which means they will starve. Kora is about to leave when the new soldiers attack a young girl, and she decides to take matters into her own hands. In a way, you may wonder if Zack Snyder’s Rebel Moon is some cinematic version of The Milgram Experiment or, in a more entertaining vein, Community’s The Duncan Principle, pondering how much painstaking neon-colored boredom one can take. The first act has some juice, with Boutella developing an exciting action character that matches Snyder’s fast-start, slow-stop fight scenes. Then, the second act begins, most of the mystery dissolves, and endless exposition becomes the name of the game for the last 90 minutes. Your standard clichés spend an hour recruiting characters to bring back to Veidt, but the scenes are overly long. Each character is explored in a backstory that’s grating. These are usually scenes done in a quick montage within a few minutes. From Djimon Hounsou’s General Titus, Staz Nair’s “Fabio-light” animal whispering Tarak, and Doona Bae’s annoyingly empathetic cyborg swordmaster Nemesis, these are all cardboard cutout action film characters you’ve seen before. And when Rebel Moon finds something interesting, Kai’s (Charlie Hunnam) character is a storytelling trope with no reason to exist other than to move the plot to a more conspicuous location. When Snyder, Shay Hatten (Army of the Dead), and Kurt Johnstad’s (300, Atomic Blonde) script des find a character to spark an emotional impact, we meet them so briefly that the big scene the film builds towards isn’t entirely earned, and the audience feels cheated. Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire is not worth watching in theaters or streaming until we find out where the companion part is headed. That leads us to the most interesting character, a robot named Jimmy (voiced by Anthony Hopkins), who explores the theory of “autonomous robots.” However, we don’t see the character again until a brief shot at the end. This is the most exciting theme in the film—your only hope is if this is explored more in Rebel Moon – Part Two: The Scargiver. Almost everything else is an exercise of science-fiction banality. In the meantime, you’ll be stuck with the same Indiana Jones’s oppressive totalitarian characters, The Matrix’s Existentialism regarding reality vs illusion, and Star Wars rebellion recycled thousands of times in our lifetime. The second part of Mr. Snyder’s vision may relieve some criticisms. However, the likelihood of anyone having the stamina to stomach the second film after this mess is a gamble you shouldn’t net the house on. M.N. Miller is a film and television critic and a proud member of the Las Vegas Film Critic Society, Critics Choice Association, and a 🍅 Rotten Tomatoes/Tomato meter approved. He holds a Bachelor's Degree from Mansfield University and a Master's from Chamberlain University. However, he still puts on his pants one leg at a time, and that's when he usually stumbles over. When not writing about film or television, he patiently waits for the next Pearl Jam album and chooses to pass the time by scratching his wife's back on Sunday afternoons while she watches endless reruns of California Dreams. M.N. Miller was proclaimed the smartest reviewer alive by actor Jason Isaacs but chose to ignore his obvious sarcasm. You can also find his work on Hidden Remote, InSession Film, Ready Steady Cut, Geek Vibes Nation, and Nerd Alert."
"Dec 21, 2023",positive," Rebel Moon opens in an agrarian colony on Veldt, a moon orbiting a ringed planet much like Saturn. When the colony is invaded by soldiers from the Imperium, it’s up to the orphaned Kora (Sofia Boutella) to recruit fighters to help the villagers. The problem is the rebels are scattered all over the galaxy. Before Kora departs, she takes out a dozen or so enemies armed only with a hatchet – the first of many well-executed battles spread throughout the movie. On a desert planet, Kora finds Tarak (Staz Nair), a warrior who can communicate with the animal world. Next, on a dying world polluted by mining, Nemesis (Bae Doona) displays expert sword skills. Titus (Djimon Hounsou), a disgraced Regent general, joins the team from a gladiator planet. Meanwhile, the rebels are pursued by Admiral Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein), a ruthless killer who commands the King’s Gaze spaceship. No one is safe from his men, not even the mercenaries trying to betray the rebels. If it seems like you’ve seen this before, you probably have. The director has cited The Dirty Dozen and The Lord of the Rings among his inspirations; it’s easy to pick out nods to other big-budget blockbusters as well. Rebel Moon is as easy to read as a billboard and about as deep. Once it gets going, the movie sprints at a furious pace, stopping only to indulge in too many slow-motion leaps, kicks and punches. Because not everything in Rebel Moon makes sense. Bae’s Nemesis is fascinating, and her battle scene deep in the bowels of a cobalt mine is a highlight of the movie, but her powers are confusing, and like the other rebels, she doesn’t get much chance to explain herself. Snyder, who also shot Rebel Moon and co-wrote its script, has huge ambitions for the project. The second part arrives in April, and an animated series and RPG computer game have been announced. That’s to say nothing of extended, R-rated cuts of parts one and two. Will fatigue set in first?"
"Dec 21, 2023",negative," The allusionism is strong with this one. Zack Snyder’s latest visual extravaganza, the loftily titled Netflix production Rebel Moon – Part 1: A Child of Fire, draws more than a modicum of influence from Akira Kurosawa’s samurai cinema and George Lucas’ galactic franchise. Of course, Lucas already appropriated bushido honor and aspects of Japanese culture, along with story elements from Kurosawa’s The Hidden Fortress (1958), to develop the original Star Wars (1977). Snyder’s movie merely draws out the connection further with an amalgam of both filmmakers, offering a hodgepodge of ideas from better movies, repurposed here to lackluster effect. Aside from a few neat aliens and a rousing laser gun battle or two, there’s not much in these familiar proceedings to maintain the viewer’s interest. The movie plays less like an affectionate homage and more like a lifeless and derivative composite, underserviced by Snyder’s interest in cool images over compelling characters. Armed with a talented cast and occasionally impressive visuals, Rebel Moon neither transcends nor pays adequate respect to its influences, making for a flagrant and pedestrian imitation of better material.  The story is an unmistakable copycat of Seven Samurai (1954). That Kurosawa’s all-time classic goes uncredited is troubling, if not grounds for a lawsuit. After all, Italian filmmaker Sergio Leone was sued when he remade Kurosawa’s Yojimbo (1962) into the Spaghetti Western A Fistful of Dollars (1964) without permission. And while John Sturges credited Kurosawa’s sprawling and human epic in his remake, The Magnificent Seven (1960), Pixar also borrowed the story structure for A Bug’s Life (1998) without an official acknowledgment. To that end, at least Snyder, who conceived the story and co-wrote the screenplay with Kurt Johnstad and Shay Hatten, has some precedent for not giving Kurosawa’s film an “inspired by” reference here, despite his story following that film’s first half almost beat by beat. Lucas has less of a case against Snyder, who merely borrows the intangible flavor of Star Wars for his world-building details—sci-fi movies have been doing that for years. Still, one wonders if Rebel Moon – Part 2: The Scargiver, set for release in April 2024, will continue with Kurosawa’s story structure. Probably so, given that Part 1 has so few original ideas.  Accented with overblown choral music, the story takes place in a galaxy ruled by an imperialist Motherworld, whose assassinated King (Cary Elwes) was replaced by a brutal ruler, Regent Balisarius (Fra Fee). Determined to quash any dissenters, Balisarius orders Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein) to hunt down rebels. Landing on the habitable moon called Veidt, home to a vaguely Icelandic community of peaceful farmers who have just completed their annual harvest orgy to appease their gods, Noble orders the locals to hand over the bulk of their next reaping in ten weeks to feed his army. Kora (Sofia Boutella), a farmer and former warrior with a mysterious past connected to the Motherworld, refuses to comply and sets out with her village’s harvest manager, Gunnar (Michiel Huisman), to find others who will fight the imperial forces on their behalf. Instead of visiting a local village, as in Seven Samurai, Kora and Gunnar enlist the help of a rogue bounty hunter, Kai (Charlie Hunnam), to help them travel to nearby planets and convince proven fighters to help their cause.  While Kora and Gunnar, profoundly uninteresting characters, search for help, Snyder introduces us to a familiar band of renegades and freedom fighters, each drawn from tropes in Kurosawa’s work: a master of swordplay, Nemesis (Doona Bae); a former general on a gladiatorial world who wants to forget that he surrendered (Djimon Hounsou); Tarak (Staz Nair), a perpetually shirtless warrior who can bond with animals; and Darrian Bloodaxe (Ray Fisher), an insurgent leader who commands the rebellion. Most of these personalities are so thin that the plot mechanics, not the characters and their choices, drive the story. Like Seven Samurai, the movie finds them outnumbered and clashing with their enemies, building to what will probably be a much larger showdown in the sequel. But unlike Kurosawa’s masterpiece, Snyder isn’t interested in giving the farmers much gradation; his treatment is rather like Star Wars in that respect, where good and evil are polarized. Snyder’s grasp of the dimensions in Kurosawa’s film is about as tenuous as the remakes by Sturges or Antoine Fuqua (in 2016). Though the plot follows Kurosawa, most of Rebel Moon’s presentation resembles a Star Wars movie. Snyder originally developed the idea for Lucas’ universe, and his cinematic sampling is unsubtle, from alien-filled cantinas to bad guys imbued with Nazi characteristics. Even the sound effects recall Ben Burtt’s beeps, bloops, and pew-pews from Star Wars. Among Snyder’s innovations—nay, oddities—is the self-aware droid named Jimmy, voiced by Anthony Hopkins, who has a few small scenes early on and for whom Snyder has big things planned, apparently, given its obscurely and unexplained horned appearance in the finale. On the plus side, Jena Malone’s appearance as a spidery humanoid makes for a creepy, inspired sequence, though it leads to Snyder revealing Nemesis’ veritable lightsabers, another dull reference. But the allusions to better movies don’t limit themselves to Kurosawa and Lucas. A sequence straight out of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) finds a character bowing to a creature that looks suspiciously like a hippogriff.  As ever, the director’s capacity for grandiose-looking cinema remains impressive. Serving as director of photography, Snyder is a compelling visualist, creating iconic images, the ambitions of which often outweigh the capabilities of his reported $160 million-plus budget. The result occasionally has the look and feel of Lucas’ prequel trilogy, with flat backdrops and a deadened digital sheen. Nevertheless, this is unmistakably a Snyder production, complete with his signature use of slow motion to create a sense of awed suspension during action scenes. But even that is a Kurosawa technique. To be sure, Kurosawa employed a similar tactic in Seven Samurai, where he edited slow-motion sequences into otherwise fast-paced action, creating a dramatic juxtaposition of film speeds. That’s been one of Snyder’s tricks since his earliest work, and it’s used here on dramatically falling seeds and a spear-wielding soldier leaping into the air—images that recall Snyder’s own Dawn of the Dead (2004) and 300 (2007). If this all sounds like I’m dwelling too much on Snyder’s inspirations, know that if Rebel Moon featured better storytelling, perhaps I wouldn’t only see or care about its pilfering. For instance, Lucas wasn’t exactly reinventing the wheel when he made Star Wars; he pieced together aspects of Flash Gordon serials and Japanese samurai cinema to create something familiar but new. But Lucas’ distinct characters, the actors who played them, and the world-building were so inspired that the antecedents hardly registered. He transcended his influences, which is the mark of compelling art. Snyder’s efforts have too few new ideas to distinguish Rebel Moon from its iconic antecedents, making it feel more like a pastiche than an inspired piece of filmmaking that uses its sources as a launchpad. Even as a melange of better material, the PG-13-rated Rebel Moon fails to impress, making the prospect of his promised R-rated extended cut far less intriguing than his alternate take on Justice League (2021). Rather, the upcoming extended version feels like a Netflix gimmick designed to replicate the (faux) hullabaloo around the whole #releasethesnydercut campaign, which, as marketing goes, proves as hollow as the movie it’s attempting to promote. "
"Dec 20, 2023",negative,"The bulk of the narrative feels like the middle of a story stretched out over two hours, with the ending lopped off."
