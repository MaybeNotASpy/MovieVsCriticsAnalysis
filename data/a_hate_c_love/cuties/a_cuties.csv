Feb 20 2024,positive,mignonnes talks about what people are too scared to talk about it is about the dangers of social media on children and how much it can influence young children to act like adults it is supposed to make you uncomfortable it is supposed to make you think that we as a society need to do something maïmouna doucouré is an amazing director and feminist and we need more minds like hers
Feb 11 2024,positive,i want to make something perfectly clear  despite what you may be hearing on social media there is not a single solitary second of exploitation to be found in this surprisingly fantastic and incredibly moving film with a title that sounds like a bad disney kids movie i was shocked to witness the most profound sometimes unsettling and totally enthralling movie about being a young female since catherine hardwickes thirteen 2003 filmmaker doucoure treats this material with bravery and stark realism  there are moments almost impossible to watch because of how painfully honest they feel the controversy seems to surround the frank handling of preteen life particularly the suggestive dancing and clothing or lack thereof worn by the young females in this movie as well as a very brief glimpse of nudity that literally lasts one second but the filmmakers in no way shape or form use this for exploitation  quite the contrary these scenes produced feelings of sadness rather than titilation it broke my heart to see young amy an extraordinary performance by youssouf and her peers experience the mental physical and emotional confusion of becoming a young adult the movie beautifully captures how the youth of today confuse being provocative with being a grownup if youve seen a single moment of toddler and tiaras nothing that happens here should be surprising and to be quite honest im a bit pissed off right now because im afraid the controversy may dissuade many conservative viewers from actually watching and discussing this film i think anyone who was or has or had a preteen girl will find much with which they can relate and share with each other there are isolated moments here and there that feel a bit much but when viewed in the context of the film as a whole its nearly perfect theres a lot more i can say  i didnt even have a chance to discuss how amys conservative home life and religion impact a good portion of what happens here a couple scenes between amy and her mom are just wonderful please please please do not be swayed from seeing this it is a vital important movie  easily one of the best of the year  and i think youll have a lot to think about and discuss after the subtly beautiful ending
Nov 26 2023,negative,as far as its quality goes its not a poorly made movie it would have so much potential had it not been for the decision to sexualize children i marveled the cinematography and directing at times but would squirm in my seat and look away once the dancing scenes popped up
Nov 25 2023,negative,do i really need to explain why
Nov 24 2023,negative,the fact that this piece of trash movie got a 87 is absolutely disgusting
Nov 3 2023,negative,the film is so bad that it is very well executed for this sole purpose to be unbelievably bad the reviews from critics and the public are so controversial about this film that i think there is certainly a money laundering scheme involved
Nov 3 2023,negative,how does this have a higher procent than the fnaf movie
Nov 1 2023,negative,this movie is terrible
Oct 26 2023,negative,0100 wtf were the critics thinking
Oct 20 2023,negative,sexualization of children
Oct 12 2023,negative,did someone really believe that sexualizing children will appease critics
Sep 27 2023,negative,i dont know what to think of the critic giving such a high score to this garbage there should be money involved for sure
Sep 14 2023,negative,a totally crapphole movie the critics that give a 5 star rating are useless
Aug 25 2023,negative,straight up cp the critics who gave this degeneracy positive reviews have outed themselves
Aug 18 2023,negative,i feel a deep sadness and anger when i see the critics praising this movie i think they are out of touch with the audience who have been disgusted by the movie the movie shows young girls in sexualized ways and the critics think its one of the best comingofage movies i think this is wrong i cant believe that the critics are so blind and irresponsible they are literally promoting sexualizing of little girls and this not a problem with only this movie when critics think a movie is rotten the audience think its one of the best this duality cant continueit shouldnt continue
Aug 4 2023,negative,its just straightup child pornography
Jul 26 2023,positive,cuties is actually a very good movie and an accurate portrayal of tweens and the way their behavior is influenced by adults  popular culture the movie has been downvoted by rightwing trolls who want us to believe this movie is perverted and who gaslight into believing they care about children but american rightwingers are the same folks who champion child beauty pageants in which they dress up grade schoolers in skimpy swimsuits these are also the same folks in congress who blocked the human trafficking bill including matt gaetz another fake champion of minors who trafficked teenagers so these peoples criticism of the movie should be taken with a grain of salt     any tween and their older siblings should watch this movie its relevant to who they are and shows whats it like to be that age and what its like to have a notion of certain matters of adulthood without the benefit of experience and wisdom
Jul 23 2023,negative,cuties is a poorly executed movie with awful storytelling coupled with controversial depiction of young girls and perceived encouragement of immorality and promiscuity
Jul 14 2023,negative,highly inappropriate garbage
Jul 13 2023,negative,what a waste of time better stare into the wall then watch this rotten thing
Jun 7 2023,negative,vile and disgusting unbelievable that this is a real movie
Jun 2 2023,negative,i dont find this entertaining from all prespective
May 15 2023,negative,not sure the message this film was trying to get across but it failed as a parent i would never allow my child to act in anything close to this
May 10 2023,positive,this review needs a small caveat i dont recommend cuties to just anyone this is a mature movie with some very mature themes and it should be approached with subjects like femininity womanhood and puberty in mind it brings up often uncomfortable questions about ageappropriateness in a culture where girls are married at the same age as our protagonist amy she isnt much younger than the child brides in her culture like the one shes helping her mother prepare to welcome into her fathers family this is intermixed between scenes of girls fully clothed but still showing a questionable amount of skin provocatively dancing and exploring their own feminine wiles at a shockingly young age if youre a woman you may recall this awkward age the way i do when we first become aware of our sexuality and womens roles in society this movie is about that awkward place in between childhood and womanhood its complicated its embarrassing and its shot in in a remarkably tasteful way without shaming amy for her first exploration into her own womanhood she has flaws but we can see shes vulnerable and scared we want to save her from herself from the film itself but we cant its a meaningful glimpse of a moment in time that many of us have experienced i felt empathy for amy i wanted to hold her in my arms and tell her she can be a strong woman someday that she can make her own future out of selfrespect but i know that may not be true for amy that her own marriage and motherhood are coming all too soon she is being forced into an adulthood shes not ready for groomed for motherhood since birth no wonder amy is confused its a compelling look into a complex subject that deserves mature and honest discussion within a mature and honest audience
Apr 23 2023,negative,total disgrace horrific movie
Apr 17 2023,negative,this movie is disgusting oversexualization of little girls totally unnecessary not worth watching
Mar 29 2023,negative,the fact that this movie sexualizes young girls is terrible i know that there was good intentions made with this movie but it feels really hypocritical that a movie about the representation of girls is also sexualizing them
Mar 16 2023,positive,i was going into this movie expecting to hate on it but was pleasantly surprised to find an enjoyable movie with interesting characters and themes it needs to be addressed at the outset that the handful of butt and crotch shots of 11 year olds is graphic and disturbing at the same time these visuals are not there for no reason they thematically integrate into the film with the clear intent to evoke disgust and confusion from the viewer in a way that only a visual medium can do moving on from that the film is an exploration of the relationships between family and society religion and popculture through the lens of an adolescent muslim girl living in france presumably an african immigrant who is struggling to fit in it is melodramatic at times gutwrenching and at times fun and lighthearted but at all times the characters and their struggles are relatable never feeling too far from reality at the end of the day its okay for art to be boundary pushing and strange as long as its merit does not rely on that aspect alone and cuties does live up to that standard
Feb 22 2023,negative,ill rather watch paint dry than see this absolute dogshit
Feb 16 2023,negative,that was disgusting i cant believe netflix approve this movie and someone defending this
Feb 13 2023,negative,i was expecting a really well put together amazing movies based on the reviews given by the sites critics what i witnessed was truly horrifying the glorification of this kind of content is morally wrong and should never have even been made sexualizing children
Nov 28 2022,negative,felt that it danced too closely to the edge of softcore kiddie content
Nov 27 2022,negative,the discrepancy between the critics and audience scores highlights the distance between elite and normie sensibilities i didnt find cuties as despicable as conservative outlets made it out to be but i also didnt think it was a compelling exploration of the sexualization of girls normies shouldnt be accused of racism or sexism for the backlash against this film the backlash comes in a context in which the media has been sexualizing girls for decades with the occasional push to normalize pedophilia also the girls who appeared in this film were sexualized for the production overall i found it offputting and kind of boring i think the main problem was the medium the director chose to tell the story if this was a novel she could have gotten her point across without explicit imagery
Oct 22 2022,positive,kinda weird but still a really well made film it didnt really need all these girls twerking
Sep 30 2022,positive,brilliant film about young womanhood adolescence and the will to own oneself a true funny and melancholy drama centering around a young girl in a conservative family i loved how i was taken to the level of the girl trying to figure out the world around her the expectations put upon her and her own body  brilliant brave investigation into taboo with honesty care and affection for human life recommended
Sep 15 2022,negative,what was you tinking this is sick
Aug 27 2022,negative,if you actually think about it this movie is disgusting a girl that cant even make decisions accordingly at that age put up in a situation like this its just disgusting ah yes a bad mother is someone who doesnt want her daughter to twerk in front of people even these kids arent even old enough to watch their own movie this movie attacks on religious and moral values and trying to get it accepted i could give 05 if i could do
Aug 23 2022,negative,i am neither tween or female so maybe im missing something but i cant get over the number of times i had to look at a closeup of childrens butts and crotch shots so this is a no from me dawg
Aug 22 2022,negative,total disgrace to make a movie to sexuliaze children     its beyond my belief that this is acceptable
Aug 20 2022,negative,this show should have never been made
Jul 1 2022,negative,absolutely horrific sickening stuff leave it off the screen
May 18 2022,negative,if i could give it no star at all i definitely wouldve
Apr 24 2022,positive,im thankful i didnt buy into the negative reviews online    the movie isnt like anything ive seen before now one of the few movies that portray childhood without too many colors     and secondly the director is really brave     i remember growing up with my siblings in a rather shthole country which is the majority of countries and trust me we did worse life as a kid at least where i grew up isnt much different from what was portrayed in this movie
Apr 13 2022,positive,to my little stjames collection
Apr 5 2022,positive,an amazing drama about cultural conflicts immigration growingup difficulties true love of a mother to her kids its all about life  those kids did better acts than hollywood actors all acts are amazing actually they do not acting they living their roles   i have so much respect to maïmouna doucouré for her story and amazingly directing the movie you made a true gem for cinema history  and the ending song captured my soul what a beautiful song
Feb 9 2022,positive,i dont get why people dislike cuties mignonnes i understand their arguments but the girls are only dancing now to the actual review  i found this film rather entertaining on a surface level it is about a group of girls who want to be some of the top dancers but when you dig deeper you realize it is about growing up about the harshness of reality and about selfexpressionism ultimately the girls are doing what they want and they are happy about it and so am i
Jan 4 2022,positive,poignant expression with clear nuances in my perception terrific performances and an important topicmessage wasnt perfect but it was very good and a very impress first run for the writerdirector doucouré its wellknown netflix botched the translation and marketing of the title im not a movie critic but hopefully i can counter balance how dumb americans are that dont get this film and are poopooing on it mignonnes is a good film people heres another critique though americans are the dumbest humans of an already dumb species im proudly american btw so whatever 
Nov 19 2021,negative,i think that maybe someone in their teen will be able to connect with this movie for me it was just boring girls stuff which isnt interesting
Sep 23 2021,negative,no amount of good intentions is worth exploiting actual little girls to say exploiting little girls is wrong
Sep 8 2021,neutral,movie summary  parents please pay attention to your kids    i decided to give it a go to make up my own mind about the controversy in a strange twist of fate i am somehow with the critics on this one its a film critising sexualisation not glorifying it the scenes shown are confronting yes possibly even excessively so but they make the point i think the filmmaker was going for    it is a young girls confusing journey to find belonging and struggling with different cultures and friends    that being said this film was also a nonstop suffer fest that i wouldnt recommend to anyone
Jul 8 2021,negative,i tried to be fair when watching this with all the politicizing and form my own opinion    however in the end it made me queezy and nauseous  seems they spent 99 of the time sexualizing young actresses and the last few minutes trying to make it all okay  reminds me of a lars von trier shock value for shock value and grimy
Jun 7 2021,negative,the sexualization of children is never okay period
Apr 14 2021,negative,horrible it sexualizes 11yearold girls while telling us that its bad hypocrisy just hypocrisy
Apr 14 2021,negative,okok i get the message of the movie but the execution terrible do no watch this movie 010
Mar 30 2021,negative,so the movie attempts to protest the sexualization of kidsby sexualizing kids
Mar 19 2021,negative,jesus how does hollywood tolerate this kind of movies how can you make kids do these things
Mar 16 2021,negative,right intentions but rather awful execution    ill start off by saying i do believe the intentions of the filmmakers were positive there are undoubtedly minors being exposed to similar themes to that of the film so its imperative that people  particularly parents  are made aware of this    with that said cuties goes about it in entirely the wrong way the message which does become clear at the end is to stop the exploitation of children  yet here they are doing just that there are scenes andor camera angles that simply should not have been filmed and shown there is no need for certain shots    more shouldve been left for the viewer to work out as opposed to shoving it into our faces and therefore practically doing what they are criticising for example they couldve zoomed away at particular points or got an extreme close up of the characters eyes when they were doing sexualised things    for what its worth i will say i respect the performance of lead fathia youssouf amy  i felt a fair amount of emotion from her at certain points none of the other cast members stick out in my memory though none produce anything negative    ive spent a long time thinking about how i was going to word my review much longer than i usually would at least its slightly tricky as as mentioned i do believe it intended to do the right thing unfortunately though it ends up  in my eyes  doing what its trying to say is bad    there are some extreme thoughts on this film not all of which are right in my opinion however as said it isnt a good watch  even if only judging on film merits
Mar 8 2021,positive,it certainly isnt worth the polemic and hatred it got for the sexualization of children youd have to be american to question that and for one thing its purpose is exactly the criticism of what it shows it has some bright moments and a good ending but because of badly timed shots and sequences its often more cringe than anything else
Feb 25 2021,positive,although the content was a bit promiscuous for the young actresses its the premise of the story that kept me wanting to see more a great movie especially for young women
Feb 22 2021,negative,this movie is disgusting they claimed to be against the the sexualization of children but yet the entire move they in fact sexualized children they clearly shed light on 1012 year old girls being hyper promiscuous in no way is it alright for 1012 year old girls to be twerking with the big screen square in their business one scene a 1012 year old took a photo of her privates anyone who says they like this movie i would be very wary of i fear the young actresses will grow to regret what some sick producer had them do  expect lawsuits i only peaked at this movie to see if it was as bad as they say and yes it is worse than what they say i now feel like i need to be baptized after just 2030 minutes of this monstrosity
Feb 15 2021,positive,i understand what the makers were trying to do the story is very well done and explores the comingofage of amy a growing confused tween trying to understand her identity and place in her family and in the world amys search for identity crosses family traditions and religion social acceptance biological ritesofpassage social media and human sexuality i get it and applaud the creators with taking on this very relevant project  its a noble pursuit and they mostly pull it off beautifully great scenes acting costumes and shots make this story exceptional    however my criticism blends with a moral stance thats it not ok to exploit children in any way regardless of intention as a father of a 12year old daughter i already am struggling with the grip that social media and the entertainment industry have on my daughter for a profit these entities callously and hastily transition otherwise inexperienced immature girls through puberty and well beyond their ageappropriate behavioral norms im not sure we can as a society get around this without denying our kids access to the media that permeates our homes these inevitabilities aside it shouldnt give the creators license to depict the girls controversial behaviors with suchintent     its just not right sets a bad example and otherwise casts a shadow on a good movie
Feb 15 2021,positive,is this movie the best i have ever seen no is it worth all this negativity and the low audience score of course no i am pretty sure that most of the people especially in the usa couldnt see beyond the awful poster of netflix and the negative buzz that surrounded this movieand maybe a lot of them didnt watch it at all cuties is strong powerful and so emotional give it a try
Feb 3 2021,positive,this is a very beatiful and needed movie wich speaks the truth of what is nowadays coming to age using the image language of the mainsteam
Feb 2 2021,neutral,one of the biggest problems of this movie is that we dont know what to do with the discomfort of watching these girls dance in such a hyper sexualized manner the fact that the actresses are so young is very shocking and as important as it is to feel this dissonance we cant help but see the wrongness of the fact that these are children and they are actively engaging in what the movies message is trying to condemn     i can at least say that as uncomfortable as it is to watch those close ups while they are dancing it does leave a mark in me if i had a young daughter i would be monitoring her closely and would be addressing these issues constantly lets face it you cant let kids be kids any more everything that is on tv and especially online will promote our kids to engage in this kind of behavior theres too much of it and it is everywhere it is very scary     however i believe that the movie should not have shown those close ups and the length of those sequences were unnecessarily long you get the point in this case less would have been more     apart from great acting the story has some great moments and it is a strong social commentary and i do believe that it is a good representation of what it is like to be a middle school kid to deal with family matters at that age how gentrification and globalization actually impact lives     another one of the problems for me was the lack of resolution to the plot for a topic this heavy and how uncomfortable it is to watch at times it deserved some sort of raw depiction of heavy hearted consequences im all for inconclusive endings that just semi foreshadow a happier or positive outcome but in this particular movie i needed more than that to justify the intentions of the film in order to not fixate as much on the fact that these were thirteen year old actresses getting paid to rehearse and play those roles and be depicted the way they were
Jan 31 2021,negative,a film i thought was poorly advertised i decided to watch it i was wrong this is a very wrong film that can make anyone except pedophiles feel really sick and disgusted i think the worst part about the film is how the director is trying to convey a message that couldve been shown or explained better without sexualizing children in the process this is one of the worst films of the year and i think its going to earn that win at the razzies take my advice and dont watch it
Jan 30 2021,negative,not good this movie oversexualized minors
Jan 19 2021,positive,realy nice moviethanks for writer bringing to many importand isues religionbullyingsocial media attackschild explotationwith bravefulli am pleased it is not animation because especially adults should watch and movie is more realisticmain character played well and her age fitted movie perfectlywho vote this movie with low rating probably did not watched or did not understand movie
Jan 17 2021,negative,horrifyingly disgusting
Jan 17 2021,negative,this is gross sexualization of children an excuse for getting as close to child pr0n as possible in a main stream media wtf are critics thinking i couldnt keep watching made me sick not entertainment
Jan 13 2021,negative,not necessary and yet harmful obviously it was gross to watch too gross that an attempt at a moral would be the furthest thing from any viewers mind
Jan 12 2021,positive,compelling film that touched on an extremely important topic with bravery its unfortunate that this film has been review bombed by conspiracy theorists and conservative leaning political commentators if you check their profiles this is the only film they have reviewed the users that have given this a low score and reviewed other movies gave high scores to films like twilight and avengers proving that they prefer their films to be safe comfortable and easy of course they wouldnt like cuties its sad these people who have been radicalized online by hardright conservative commentators are so quick to censor a beautiful and brace piece of art such as cuties considering these same groups of people always whine and claim to be victims of censorship     anyway props to the director for touching on an increasingly important topic in our world the distortion of sexuality through social media and the effects it has on less educated children as well as the cultural rifts of misogyny in north american pop culture and more traditional islamic cultures people who cannot handle this should stick to twilight or resident evil
Jan 6 2021,neutral,i actually did watch the movie i heard about the controversy watched the directors message heard and read the defense and the accusations and decided to give it a try    is this child pornography well not exactly but there were certainly parts that i cant agree with them actually filming theres this one scene where ami decides to pull her pants down in the bathroom to take a pic and that was not something we needed to see from my own perspective that act of posting a nude could have easily been shown differently i did not need to see a childs upper thighs shown like that it would have been very easy to replace it with the door as her cousin was trying to get his phone back or even just her face or the wall or just something that wasnt a little girl pulling down her pants in front of an audience like this more than the erotic dancing more than the outfits that is my main issue the scene was not needed yes it led up to the conflict with the rest of the group and her peers but it would have been very easy to keep the effects and implytell what she had done without having to show that i know we usually operate on a show dont tell basis and the movie actually does very well with that but that was one scene where that saying doesnt apply     another scene where another girl pulled down amis pants and showed off her panties to the entire audience that was not needed either we didnt need to see that that was superfluous and the crew could have easily kept the same effect of the scene without showing off a child in her panties they could have kept the scene but changed to pov to everyone elses reactions or even have us look through amys eyes too see the reactions of her peers in this scene    if it werent for those and certain other scenes i could have accepted this for all that it made me highly uncomfortable and disgusted it is an excellent commentary on how young girls can easily be influenced and sexualized by their environment the one where shes in a purification ritual and starts twerking was especially impactful i cried because i could tell that ami was using what she had learned would garner her positive attention ie by acting sexy but juxtaposed her family viewed it as possession and illness ami was desperate and hurting and she was trying to soothe herself in the only way she really knew then her reactions and her behavior are so realistic and i almost feel like a psychologist categorizing and explaining her behaviors and why she does the things she did     then theres her friend angelica how we find out how she herself turned to dancing amidst all the negative attention from her own family how her education garners her scoldings but her dance skills get her praise and so this young girl has latched onto dance so desperately for the positive attention she lacks it really could have been a greater movie and it makes me so upset to know that    were it not for those positives i would have failed this movie but im leaving it here at a 25 im sorry and i did try but they did not need to have those scenes such as how lolita was meant to bring attention to the things we allow mignnones brings to attention the oversexualization of young girls and how easy it is to influence them through the media they ingest     im sorry but i now know what a young girls inner thighs looks like and that was not something i am okay with this movie spread that image around and it was not okay for this crew to film that no matter the intentions it is inexcusable what they have allowed i feel so sorry for the young girl who played amy and i am enraged that the filming of her inner thighs and of her in her underwear was allowed no matter the shock value or the impact that is a child and this was very not okay    i do not think that movie should have been allowed at the very least since the original version will most likely still run uncensored netflix should have censored those scenes a child does not need to be paraded around in her underwear and she should not be filmed with her pants down i stand with cruz and others on this cuties is not appropriate and does show signs of child pornography did the director mean for it to be like that i really dont think so and i feel like it was the very last thing she wanted however intentions dont matter so much here actions do those scenes should not have been allowed and i stand by that decision this is not a call to hate on the director but my honest judgement after watching this movie its disappointing because this really could have been an amazing commentary but
Jan 4 2021,positive,admittedly this was beyond difficult to watcha truly shocking film portrayal of the horrifying reality that of so many kids girls are put through under such tremendous pressures to endure being shaped molded and to being rushed into sexualizing themselves and growing up far too fast the film is so disturbing and presents itself in the utmost honest way i think the point is to be extremely controversial in itself this is meant to be an uncomfortable commentary an inappropriate psychological case study
Jan 3 2021,positive,cuties is a film that has been judged harshly by those that either have not seen it or lacks the depth to understand it     intrigued by the negative reviewers of the movie and its controversial subject i decided to see for myself what the fuss was about upon finishing the film i was shocked and honestly disappointed that such a wonderful film was so misunderstood i do understand the outrage towards it because of the way it filmed the adolescent girls and how the characters acted but see this is reality this is the point of the film that many fail to see girls at a young age are sexualized and are applauded for it in a lot of industries specially the entertainment industry this isnt an exaggeration girls as young as 11 do dance and act the same way the characters in the film do because of the media they are exposed to     instead of being mad at the film what about be mad about the industries that do this the point of the film was to shine a light on the issue and yet instead of focusing your anger at the issue youre pissed at the film
Jan 1 2021,positive,this film is so misunderstood because of how uncomfortable and taboo it is but its also deep i know its crazy how they made those children dance like that but pay attention to the movie itself it gives an interesting and rarely seen message about sexual maturity
Jan 1 2021,negative,something disgusting like this rotten movie should never exist this goes beyond movie criticism this movie is so immoral
Dec 28 2020,positive,an important meditation on the search for meaning among young people in an age of declining religiosity and social media obsession  those who have hysterically attacked the movie mostly havent seen it  it is actually preaching a message that most of them would agree with  there are more important things than likes on instagram    the basic story tells  the tale of a young african immigrant family who joins friends in starting a dance troop specializing in provocative routines only to eventually become unhappy with what they were doing
Dec 28 2020,positive,cuties is misunderstood yes they went to far with the topic i do think this should be taken off of netflix but it really does show the topic and conflict very well
Dec 25 2020,negative,this was so disgusting 
Dec 20 2020,positive,im rating this five stars because the actors were unfortunately amazing in their roles because honestly its true girls at this age are immersing themselves in pop culture which has been hypersexualized moreover this film was able to capture all of that but i do agree that it is hard to watch and i wish they wouldve used legal adults that portray children to get the message across but solely looking at this from a logical perception instead of an emotional perception it got the point across again i just wish they wouldve used actual adults instead of children
Dec 13 2020,negative,disgusting do not watch dont waste an hour and a half of your yearly netflix subscription id give it lower if it let me
Dec 5 2020,positive,artistic and emotional purposefully uncomfortable to watch at times because its a brilliant commentary on the oversexualization of preteen girls this is happening all around us regardless of race religion or socioeconomic status this film holds a mirror to the face of society if we dont like what we see its up to us to change it and teach our daughters that they have value beyond their bodies
Dec 5 2020,negative,calling out the hypersexualization of young girls by hypersexualizing young girls bravo netflix
Dec 4 2020,negative,well that was strange
Dec 3 2020,negative,netflix has gone very dark with their movies young girls should not be sexually exploited for any reason same on netflix
Nov 28 2020,negative,heres are some scenes of hypersexalized prepubescent girls to show why its bad
Nov 27 2020,neutral,while i think the movies negative reception is overblown this film failed to convey its message in a clear manner one doesnt need to sexualize young girls to prove that sexualizing young girls is wrong its common knowledge and this film  while not bad in the traditional sense  came across as startlingly tonedeaf
Nov 26 2020,positive,this movie is not worth the controvsery
Nov 20 2020,negative,despite the message it tried to tell it utterly failed and just added to the problem forgetting the specific scenes its just bland and forgettable but the constant twerking done by these girls makes this film atrocious and the fact its being defended is a testament to what we have become
Nov 16 2020,positive,its an okay movie not superb nor bad nothing exceptional but i feel the allegation of paedophilia is an overreaction the girls are wearing those clothes for performance not on the streetpeople worn all kinds of weird clothes for performances sake  lets be real here the only reason this movie got shitted on is that the protagonist is a muslim girl that finds the hijab to be restrictive rather than liberating muslims need to understand that everyone has different feelings with hijab some felt it is liberating some felt it is restrictive and should only be for religious service that is their choice the film is about a young girl that reach her adolescences and discovering her sexuality i find these girls in skimpy clothes to be hilarious like how my sister and i used to dress up like adults people who find them arousing should get their psyche checked the girls are not the problem society is
Nov 14 2020,negative,this movie will only encourage kids to dance half naked in tik tok nothing more
Nov 13 2020,negative,there is no justification for the existence of this movie it could have easily portrayed its ultimate themes without supporting such disturbingly lewd content
Nov 10 2020,positive,i think this was a brilliant movie about coming of age as an outsider a tale of misogyny and internalized misogyny and a young woman trying to find her place in it all
Nov 8 2020,positive,the movie is controversial it is shocking and it is awkward to watch there are moments where you feel it went too far but it is also smart sensitive and it makes you think back on the times when you were a young 11 years old girl  could this movie be done differently absolutely   but is good for what it is now and thenbacklash this movie got is honestly insane
Nov 7 2020,positive,maïmouna doucouré poignantly and beautifully captures the struggles of a preteen girl as she grapples with the powerlessness of childhood and womanhood through dance religion social media sexuality and cultural clashes
Nov 6 2020,negative,the film becomes the exact thing its allegedly trying to expose
Oct 19 2020,positive,i watched this purely because of the controversy i understand why people were so upset  theres a lot of hypersexualisation of young girls parading these young actresses in front of a global audience is in many ways irresponsible but in the era of social media theyd probably be doing it on their social media platforms anyway this film if anything is a critique of modern western society and social media and the influence it has on our young people it also explores the sometimes oppressive redemptive nature of more traditional cultures particularly for young immigrants living in a modern western environment unsure of what to do or who to be i think the film has more dignity than the popular reviews indicate if you can see past the children in hot pants
Oct 17 2020,positive,some people in america seem determined to slam this movie most likely for political reasons note  the french people thought it was great it is a coming of age film about a group of 11 year old girls who live in the impoverished muslim area of paris they seek to distinguish themselves by participating in a hiphop dance contest this is strictly forbidden by their religion so they are considered rebellious and consequently are selftaught thus their moves are rather primitive and include pelvic rocking which some critics find horrifying these critics must have never been involved with young girls dance or seen dance moms or little miss sunshine it is rather commonplace amy was an especially sad character she has to cope with her father taking a 2nd wife and is ultimately rejected by her friends that she had worked so hard to be accepted by
Oct 14 2020,positive,occasionally difficult and uncomfortable to watch it still raises important issues in a thoughtful way
Oct 13 2020,positive,i loved it it is a great story of a girl fighting to fit in and making some unfortunate choices and dealing with the consequences  navigating friends family upbringing and of course social media and societies expectations
Oct 12 2020,positive,authentic to the tweenteen coming of age experience the quest to belong and be popular and the lengths one will go to achieve is realistically portrayed having the family drama coincide brings more depth and realness   the ending is more open and interpretive than american audiences are accustomed while theres a moment between mother and amy theres no real communication or discussion within the family for anyone to come to terms with anything thats going on the ending is uplifting so you feel good having invested the time and appreciate the message and story told yet the ending does make you wonder if there should have been a little more or a something little different
Oct 11 2020,negative,this movie i thought was bad from beginning to end sensualizing 11 year old girls is not intreterent bad script actresses with very bad performance irritating characters both the girls being the famille mignonnes only has a nice scene the rest of the film is a waste of time i cant understand how some people like this movie trash its tacky
Oct 11 2020,positive,i watched this movie last night and was shocked to find out it had such a low rating by the audience it was extremely well done i cried i was moved i was angry and felt happy and sorry for the girl all at once this is the sign of an excellent movie     the director dealt with many many issues and brilliantly got them all in the length of a feature film     its about a young immigrant girl born in a religiously conservative household it could have been any but in this case it was muslim she desperately wants to love and be loved by her mother who appears to be a good mother but extremely stressed at this point in time as she seems to be have a conflict with her husband and is experiencing some of the injustice that religion foists upon women thats not explored but what is beautifully is how that daughter takes on the emotions of the mom her sadness and angry here at 11 she doesnt know how to process those emotions add to that her hormonal changes and the dynamics at school     the girl amy lives in the projects and the friends she finds at school mean well however you can see that none of them have education around conflict resolution sex germ transmission social media etc they try to do their best with self and group care but do so from a place of ignorance and the high strung emotions of kids going through or about to go through puberty is well displayed if not grating hey welcome to reality     another theme which is extremely relevant and documented to american as well as french society is the effect on the internet and social networking the girls focus their popularity and try to navigate not only their offline world but their online world how many likes you get matters you do things to get more likes not realizing the consequences on top of that the internet ranks all of our most shocking things higher so the girls find those shocking things video clips close to porn and try to emulate them because they are popular as a result their offline behavior becomes overly sexualized to the point of shocking
Oct 11 2020,negative,theyre making a movie about sexualizing children while actually sexualizing children 15
Oct 10 2020,negative,talk about flawed logic trying to show a movie about how its bad to sexualize childrenwait for itby sexualizing children disgusting
Oct 10 2020,positive,it is a great movie clearly misunderstood it takes us into a deep reflection on immigration multiculturalism poverty gender issues and sexuality through a realistic portrait the movie invites us to think critically about vulnerability family issues and the sexualization of children and teenagers
Oct 9 2020,negative,child exploitation go brr
Oct 9 2020,positive,this movie is amazing and is addressing some of the controversies of onlineinternet impacts on the youngest generation the zeitgeist and how difficult it is still in this new century to journey from a child to young womanhood especially in our society of conflicting moral backgrounds sounds ominous well yes but the movie is still a good story entertaining well told and profound    it addresses a young girls struggle with acceptance belonging peer pressure curiosity sexuality tradition religion and expectation in a well thoughtout and captivating manner its honest its raw and its probably the most important movie a mother and father can watch with their young teenage girls and boys to bring awareness and dialogue to very complex and controversial issues that the youth of today faces
Oct 8 2020,positive,a deeper message that people need to understand but i think it went a little too far
Oct 7 2020,negative,the critics have lost all creditability with their reviews of cuties  i will trust reviews from anyone after this one  when the critics and the audience are at complete odds something very wrong is happening  wake up netflix
Oct 7 2020,positive,this movie was very good and very eyeopening to how young girls are in other cultures and the challenges of trying to fit in its no wonder ignorant people who have never watched the movie are giving it negative reviews this movie deserves an award
Oct 7 2020,positive,i very much liked the film it holds a up a painful mirror we are that material and sexualized world that our innocent and defenseless children must traverse may god forgive us
Oct 6 2020,positive,great cautionary tale of how our youth are being brainwashed by the sex industry
Oct 5 2020,negative,stop sexualizing kids as they sexualize kids
Oct 5 2020,positive,puritanical america took this film badly its too bad americans are so perverted they cant appreciate a talented new female black director
Oct 5 2020,positive,magnificent heart felt and timely
Oct 4 2020,positive,explores the cultural hypersexualization of girls well done
Oct 2 2020,negative,i watched the movie out of spite for the conservative outcry about it while i had to agree they did overdo the sexualizing part it didnt bother me the story and especially the ending was really unsatisfactory i was hoping for some resolution at the end but instead it felt unfinished
Sep 30 2020,positive,this film is representative of an existing culture and if it makes viewers uncomfortable then i would argue that it has done its job adolescence is an uncomfortable and complicated time particularly in the modern technology rich era in which the film is set it is a realistic and thoughtful depiction of a girl struggling to find her place in a world where neither extreme set forth by her peers or by her family feel safe or supported many coming of age movies will ultimately glamorise and soften the situation but this film is gritty and poignant and doesnt shy away from that which may not sit comfortably with the viewer perhaps it is important that films exist that do not aim to demonise girls for buying into a societally accepted sexualisation of women and instead simply show us in simple terms how difficult it is to escape this sexualisation particularly when one is young and impressionable
Sep 29 2020,positive,its a beautiful sensitive smart film about a young girl trying to find her way in life  its message is powerful and important  it says a lot about my young generation both in good and in bad ways  this movie deserves more awards
Sep 29 2020,positive,pretty great most people who are outraged did not even actually watch the movie other people dont quite understand things like movies fiction art acting and like to interpret things quite literally instead of looking for actual meanings and themes the movie is raw and real and just like life and reality is it aint always pretty
Sep 28 2020,negative,a movie that strives to raise awareness for the hypersexualisation of girls by sexualising girls moronic
Sep 27 2020,positive,very good as plot and kudos for the courage to tackle this difficult topic  like it or not this is what is to be a young girl in todays sick society still the movie is not the best realisation of the good idea
Sep 27 2020,positive,it is a heartfelt story about a young girl trying to make sense of her world  the movie captures the exuberance of youth  a conservative family tragedy borne from muslim tradition pulls a daughter  from her mother amidst the sex and dance and image of western social media  a girl is confused  angry sad reflective and lost  vibrant  the music is as eclectic as the clashing cultures     the story is pertinent the pressures of fitting in  as  intense for a young one in paris as in senegal as it is here in the united states wherever a cell phone signal can reach    those of you who canceled netflix because of this movie and never even turned it on i pity you it it difficult to leave a hole if you dont open your eyes long enough to climb out of it     please watch the youtube interview with director  maimouna doucoure  she is strong  shes proud of her film  she is dedicated to changing a culture that objectifies women and burdens young girls with the pressures of sex and the endless online competition of social acceptance
Sep 25 2020,negative,a movie that talks about the sexualization of kids by sexually exploring kid actors next theyll be abusing real animals to prove to these pseudointellectuals that abusing animals is wrong the movie sexualizes these actors to the upmost degree especially the way it is shot there really is no defense
Sep 24 2020,positive,the only controversy surrounding cuties is in the twisted minds of perverted adults this is a honest coming of age movie about french tweens that dares to tell us about the pressures that adolescents face in the digital social world great storytelling and a very good movie see it
Sep 24 2020,positive,like many others i took notice of this film precisely due to the scandal unfolding around it when i saw the headlines calling to ban both the film itself and netflix that distributed it i wondered  what could be so horrible about that movie watching the trailer and the final dance scene seemed to give me a clear answer little girls in tight shorts rubbing against each other and languidly biting their fingers  thats really horrifying i went to watch the film itself with an established opinion about it and one single purpose to see with my own eyes what we have reached as a society once a filthy movie like this is now being broadcasted but did these expectations come true to find out first let us take a look at the plot    the film starts with 11yearold ami moving from senegal to france with her devout family she goes to a new school and soon understands how the way a girl is taught to be in a strict islamic family is very different from the way her new classmates behave the differences are also noticed by her peers amy is quickly becoming an outcast and even being bullied in spite of this the collision withfreedom that waspreviously unknown to her puts the first sprouts of protest in the main characters mind    what happens next makes ami finally lose sight of all the values that her family has instilled in her she accidentally finds out that her father got engaged to a second wife back in senegal and soon intends to bring her to their house ami takes this news as a betrayal especially towards her mother  particularly once she sees how the community and tradition force a woman killed in grief to portray joy for her husband and welcome the young bride into her apartment at the purely female prayer meeting that ami attends with her mother the religious mentor of their community also a woman inspires women stand below men we have to be humble we have to obey our husbands in everything in this way ami draws a parallel for herself between humbleness and misogyny obedience and oppression and she feels the natural urge to reject both throwing herself into all the hard things    thus everything that happens next is amys attempt to escape from her usual way of life which has turned into hell in this she is helped by new friends who just yesterday bullied her at school  children running away from problems in their families just like her all of them are looking for a way to make themselves heard but heres the trouble among successful examples they have only a group of older girls dancing in a provocative manner     the idea of the movie is painfully simple and has been raised many times in the world filmmaking a child disappointed in everything he was used to finds themselves in a bad company and is thrown into a cruel adult world that they know nothing about it is important that the way ami reasoned and made decisions only emphasizes her young age and naivety     but why exactly this picture caused such a storm of negativity from the public and even before the premiere its not only about bad marketing which was already discussed a lot but also about some incorrect directors decisions    in my opinion the root of the problem is how the dance scenes were filmed they are long the choreography is rehearsed by young actresses so well that it ceases to look as awkward and unnatural as it should be and the camera skillfully picks up individual movements as if we were watching a regular dance video or a new part of step up all this not only casts doubt on the moral side of the question but also hits the atmosphere of the film making the main message less obvious see the main focus of the film is not on dance but on children deprived of emotional support from adults and therefore forced to look for it in sexualized media in this case why give so much screen time for twerking then if the plot of the film screams to us about how much girls passion for twerk is absurd and unnatural why does the staging of dance scenes and camera work not echo it wouldnt it be better to use amateur filming and less rehearsed choreography   one cannot help but touch upon the ethical side of the question in my opinion it would be better to use understudies in candid scenes than to ask young actresses like their heroines to do adult things the meaning of which they do not really understand     many of those who watched the movie believe that the hardcore scenes should have been removed at all but i strongly disagree with this when a director raises such topics it is absolutely impossible to spare an ordinary viewer without making the viewer feel disgusted with what is happening on the screen the message cant be conveyed either let me give you a simple example think of movies where instead of twerking young heroes would choose another unchildish passion  say drugs one of the brightest representatives of such films is christiane f  wir kinder vom bahnhof zoo by uli edel this movie is what many consider to be the best antidrug propaganda and now lets imagine the same film but without dirty public restrooms and brothels children sticking syringes in their veins and perverts giving them money for another dose in exchange for fulfilling their wishes would this film have had the same strong beneficial effect on the viewer if the author hadnt shown us all the above i hardly think so     such unpleasant films are essential for society yes they make us look at something that we would like not to know existed however such phenomena do not cease to exist from our unwillingness to make sure of that just download tiktok     its very easy to define a phenomenon as vicious and turn away from it in disgust but its much harder to try and deal with it without prejudices we pretend that there is something unnatural and abnormal about childrens interest in sexuality although each of us has gone through this phase in the process of growing up we all know firsthand how much less embarrassing it could be if we had the opportunity to openly ask the sensitive questions about our body and the changes that are happening to it with someone close to us    would amis story have turned out differently if she had had the opportunity to talk to her mother about her problems without shame if it hadnt been for the obligation to keep quiet about how she really feels about her fathers second marriage the final scene of the film itself gives us the answer to this question children just want to be children but for this to happen they need us the adults not to rush to judge them not to intimidate them with religion but to understand and listen
Sep 24 2020,negative,there is absolutely no way anybody could watch this movie and get the message that this is against child exploitation it actually is pretty strongly for it it literally portrays the people who are against the child main characters sexualized behaviors as bad and backwards and tries to pass off children being sexualized as the choice of a child all the reviews defending this movie know this movie is for the sexualization of children and why they chose to defend it is a disturbing thing to wonder
Sep 24 2020,positive,a poignant expose on the social pressures on young girls to grow up too fast and become sexualized at a young age the rare glimpses of amy experiencing life in an ageappropriate way are beautiful juxtaposed with the societal pressure she and her friends feel to be involved in social media and dance provocatively for attention the movie ends with her realization that her priorities have gone off track and the final scene is  lovey realization of that
Sep 23 2020,positive,cute melancholy coming of age drama a great portrayal of the tensions inherent in the immigrant experience
Sep 23 2020,positive,it was a good movie it had at least 5 themes of importance going on in the film you really have to see the film it was sad and the theme that hi me the hardest was the idea of absent parents dont believe any fake reviews from people who didnt even see the movie the scene where the girls do dance in a provocative way that would likely make people uncomfortable also showed adults in the audience of the dance competition booing it was not glamorizing it but rather showing it in a rather tragic light again it was a good movie kinda sad some of the actors are better than others that is certainly true but overall it was powerful and id recommend it dont let conservative idiots censor it it is not promoting anything but it is an interesting and thoughtprovoking film anyone who says otherwise hasnt seen it the only issue that i could see with it is the fact that netflix inappropriately produced trailers and movie posterswebsite pics that portrayed it as a dance crew movie because it was much deeper than that
Sep 23 2020,positive,amy who is senegalese lives with her mother and brother in a paris neighborhood she wants to become a member of the cuties a hiphop dance group she befriends jess one of the cuties and soon teaches herself the dance moves begins to dress like them and begins teaching them new dance moves that she has found on the internet the controversy over this film is completely overblown but i will leave that aside for the moment and focus on what the film is it is a striking coming of age film about a preteen girl who finds herself in the conflict between her parents her father recently returned home with a second wife who are very conservative and her friends who she wants to be like the cuties like many preteen girls look to the internet for their dance moves their sense of fashion their facial expressions it is fascinating to watch the power that the internet has over these young girls perceptions of themselves amy starts finding dance moves that are much more suggestive the girls really have no idea what any of this means except that whatever it is the moves fashion tips etc have a lot of likes as amy gets more involved with the cuties she draws further from her parents creating a tense dynamic between firstgeneration parents and the daughter who wants to fit in there is an element of preteen anger that feels very real are there suggestive elements in the film yes and they serve their purpose well in making us feel uncomfortable about the world that these girls live in one that isnt mediated by messages from these parents that could help to contextualize what is going on in passing this off as just a film that exploits girls the more important points of the film including how the internet sexualizes girls and teenagers in a mans world become lost this film gets a thumbs up from me is it a perfect film no but it is a darned good one by the first time female director that makes a bold statement i loved the ending as well  in the end amy is just an 11yearold girl the film unfortunately suffered from a terrible marketing mistake by netflix and from the thousands of people who refused to watch the movie and send around memes denouncing it yet speak about it as though they have seen it i also just started watching the social dilemma and there are some clear parallels here
Sep 23 2020,positive,this film is wonderful it is unfortunate that those with idle ignorant and inappropriate minds are targeting this film without actually watching it
Sep 22 2020,positive,a modern day coming of age french indie film the main character is a low income poc muslim immigrant living in an urban area  so maybe its a pov that much of middleamerica isnt accustom to and it makes them uncomfortable definitely doesnt deserve all the negativity its received the dubbing  wondering how amy kept her stolen cellphone charged and activated bothered me more than the content of the film i highly recommend watching it before passing judgement 
Sep 22 2020,negative,while the intention to comment on societys sexualization of young girls is admirable the movie in commenting sexualizes children absolutely irresponsible and abhorent and absurd to believe that no one noticed the contradiction between those two ideas
Sep 22 2020,positive,grossly misunderstood
Sep 22 2020,positive,pros dynamic plot original and controversial main idea   cons too many sexualized scenes i understand why they should be but their number could be less
Sep 21 2020,positive,a great movie that shines a light in the adultification of children under 13 especially by their own parents allowing them round the clock access to internet enabled devices let kids be kids
Sep 21 2020,positive,such a powerful film the director has a strong voice and i hope she continues making more wonderful movies such as this one
Sep 21 2020,positive,wonderful film and much needed accurate depiction of what young girls go through trying to fit in
Sep 21 2020,positive,too many people are forming an opinion of this beautiful movie based on a misguided decision of netflix to create a salacious trailer to promote it i did some research on the director before i sat down to watch it with an open mind but with the directors artistic goal in mind and i am here to say she nailed it     the young girls are far from sexualized it is society which only offers them such narrow choices for distraction so they turn to music videos of their favorite artists and emulate their dance moves they are not the ones who put the sexuality behind these moves it is the adults who created the video choreographies and ultimately the viewer but not them spoiler they are so innocent when one of them gets her period she is clueless what is going on in another example of their naiveté when one of them finds a used condom in a field they meet in to practice dance and act silly she amuses herself with it clearly with no awareness of not only the disgusting idea of it but also of the health risks of doing so    the casting the images of the main characters family struggling with a range of challenges that break your heart the actingit is all so moving    what a shame some will be deprived of embracing this sad but ultimately uplifting story see it for yourself dont be influenced by ignorant haters who never even gave it a chance
Sep 21 2020,positive,cuties represents an unspoken truth about our society and what a childhood can look like when not supervised or ignored
Sep 21 2020,positive,cuties is uncomfortable and thought provoking it sheds light on how the impact of society and aspects of religion and be polar opposite of how we expect young girls to be after all when should innocent little girls start turning into young brides and sexual objects we seem to praise culturally answer they shouldnt    the only part i hate about this movie is that it had such young actors acting this extremely troubling difficult part of adolescence i dont know how they were treated but i hope it was with the upmost respect and with a clear understanding of the purpose this film had  everyone who acted in this movie did a phenomenal job i hate how necessary it was to the actors especially the main girls be in such a movie what they did though was earth shattering    i truly could go on and on about every little bit that i loved in this movie thinking of it brings tears to my eyes for all the girls who are going through this its truly a struggle it troubles me that people can get so offended with a piece of fiction when whats depicted and so much worse is not only happening but encouraged by society     does this movie disgust you good it did its job it does it in the most profound way the story of cuties remembering myself at the age of 10 and thinking about all the young girls growing up with access to social media now makes my heart hurt it hurts in the best way because for once this issue is brought into light     i truly wish i had this movie when i was a young girl i wish that i had an older parent or guardian watch it with me and discuss the film of course individual parents should decide when and if their child should watch such a thing but i believe its important to watch parents might be surprised with everything their children have been exposed to even with the most diligent protection    to the creators of cuties thank you for doing what i wished more media would do show us rather than telling us the meaning of it all thank you for allowing the viewers to arrive at our own conclusions     most of all i have to thank you for the last bits of the film from when the main character was with her mother and aunt and onward from there thank you it was truly the most powerful thing i have ever seem thank you thank you thank you thank you
Sep 21 2020,negative,creating a movie to highlight the sexualization of children by sexualizing  children makes no sense
Sep 21 2020,positive,excelent movie powerful it demonstrates the plight of girls and women and the misguided and tragic ways they try to find validation
Sep 21 2020,positive,i thought it was a very accurate and authentic picture of what life is like for tweens today im american and a parent of two young children in america parents were freaking out about this movie they were totally against it i think its because they dont want to admit what life is like now for children i remember back when i was in middle school period that was back in the early 2000s and this is an accurate representation of what life was like in middle school young kids trying to grow up to fast because of the things they see on the internet and the things they see on tv parents were up in arms about the fact that these young girls were dancing like the dancers that they see on tv in the music videos ill just say that theres a whole lot worse that this movie could have shown that it didnt show that would have also been accurate as a society we as americans tend to be very hypersensitive were not as progressive as europeans obviously this is a european film i dont think a film like this would ever be allowed to be made in america its just too real
Sep 20 2020,negative,a somewhat ok story with decent acting but its no excuse for what gets shown this movie was soo insanely inappropriate with children that this is more of paedophile material piece than it is cinema they have could handle the movie soo much better by giving us the idea of what goes on instead of actually sexually explorting 11 year old girls tbh if this had been released in cinemas not only would people walk out they would demand there money back so i actually rank this as one of the most disgusting movies ive ever seen
Sep 20 2020,negative,the movie focused on tv angst in overdrive namely the main character it was a bizarre way to drive home the point of over sexualized teensor more like the impact of negative selfesteemselfworth
Sep 20 2020,negative,too bad a 0 is not an opțional în scotea this movies has surpassed all expectations in a country with an age of consent of 15 we get a sexualization of 11yolds a true master piece targeted towards pe dos and more importante to why we should be more strict în publishing filiera as î can not believe out of hundreds of people no one actually was în their right minds to block this abomination before it could taine our minds
Sep 20 2020,positive,dramatically explored how youngsters get sucked into inappropriate behavior  this young actress dealt with a difficult subject beautifully
Sep 20 2020,positive,all yall upset about how inappropriate this movie is clearly dont have a clue what the average 11 year old is exposed to in todays culture 
Sep 20 2020,positive,a fine comingofage story that is grossly misunderstood thanks to a stupid poster that netflix created and used for the movie and the marketing of it showing the girl dance troupe at a contest an image that does not represent this the movie has been accused by many of sexualizing young girls but the message in the movie is actually the exact opposite its against it it needs to be seen to understand this but most people will judge the book by the cover only it seems  or not watch the film until the end or just go along with the wordofmouth about it and assume those against it must be right in their opinions of it  a movie many critics understood but the masses refuse to  this did not win an award at the sundance film festival for nothing
Sep 20 2020,positive,if youve parented a girl taught girls been a girl or have any interest in understanding the societal and emotional pressures of growing up female in any culture this is for you there are multiple critical lens through which a person could watch this film is it a criticism of the wests fraught but permissive enabling of sexualization in young girls is it a criticism of conservative religion that subjegates women of all ages is it a tender tragic comingofage story does it challenge our attitudes about the definition of female empowerment what role does poverty play in this story what is clear to me is that most girlhood stories fail to fully capture the complex and competing demands that girls must navigate on their way to becoming young women watch it before you dismiss it based on the outofcontext scenes and public backlash healthyminded adults will be uncomfortable but spend any time in a middle school or on tiktok and youll know this movie isnt showing us anything too shocking
Sep 20 2020,negative,so boring so pretentious so missed the mark
Sep 20 2020,positive,very good movie the lead character just broke my heart with her acting skills its a must see
Sep 19 2020,positive,very powerful film its interesting that this is striking a chord with the public so much so that their is a movement for subscribers of netflix to cancel their membership with the movie streaming service just for programming it i feel that this film opens that discussion of media and entertainment industrys especially the music video industrys role in sexualizing their very young models actorsrecording artists that are marked to tweens and teens who want to dress and be like the sexually provocative videos they see on youtube and other social media platforms i love how this film depicted the protagonists journey through exploration to come to terms of who she is which is neither her familys traditional cultural values or her peers sexually provocative style of being but uniquely her own somewhere in between its very well made and poised to be controversial in its stark unflinching approach to the material maybe this will open the publics eyes to why child stars sometimes turn to drugs in early adulthood and act as a cautionary tale of an industrys exportation of minor stars for the publics entertainment bribery comes to mind as she was a kid making very sexually suggestive music videos singing hit me baby one more time and oops i did it again and by 18 or so singing im a slave for you 
Sep 19 2020,negative,if i could give it no stars i would this movie is the equivalent to if the hunger games decided to spread the message that killing children is bad by killing 5 kids on camera while having artistic qualities and a good message at heart taking minors and exploiting them in this way is absolutely disgusting and in no way adds to the story telling id like to give a big thanks to the director for allowing such young children to sexually exploit themselves thanks for ruining their lives and vicariously ours
Sep 19 2020,positive,i honestly do not understand all accusations related to promoting poedophilia it is obvious from anyone who actually watched the movie that the message is all the opposite our children are overly exposed to sex from a really young age  and our still very much patriarchal society promotes sexualization of women including young women i see in this movie a warning to parents to protect their children and more generally to the world of performative arts to stop selling sex instead of art that being said the message was clear from the first choreography going for a second and third round is borderline voyeurism
Sep 19 2020,negative,so many scenes totally unnecessary this was not a thoughtful film at all
Sep 19 2020,positive,the plot wasnt perfect but fathia youssufs performance was by itself worth watching
Sep 18 2020,positive,while the movie deals with a difficult subject matter from a parental point of view i thought it clearly depicts what is going on with some of todays youth specifically girls look lets not act like social media is not having a huge impact on the worlds young people kids are exposed to way more and at a much earlier age than i ever was in the 70s and yes it is scary but it is the responsibility of those that arre raising kids to do your job raise your kids  dont bash this movie because it tells the truth  some kids are doing exactly what is portrayed in the film social and economic pitfalls play a huge part in what parents can do to limit their kids exposure some parents just shouldnt be raising kids but with all that said the movie itself was real the kid actors did a great job while it wasnt easy to watch it is happening
Sep 18 2020,neutral,just the average  french sundance movie kinda sexual and it doesnt make any sense i mean i do get the controversy but the fact is that the movie is simply quite boring but good first attempt of the director
Sep 18 2020,positive,once you get beyond all the noise of those who act like they have the authority to speak about a movie they havent even seen their intellectual capacity limited to unpacking fast food orders not art youll find a profound movie with a lot on its mind about being a tween wanting to prove your worth as an individual in a world that refuses to see you     among its many themes cuties is about the messiness of arguably the most complicating time in ones life those tricky comingofage years when we think our selfworth is determined by what others think of us by likes and retweets by getting attention the lead characters amy ultimate series of bad choices in the film reflect the logic of that stage in life how we know there is hope for amy is that by the end wisdom comes suddenly as she begins to realize that selfworth  selfrespect are determined by her choices  her values     powerful movie i think that like france other countries should introduce the film as a teaching tool so that educators  students can hash over all the issues in the movie that affect their lives
Sep 18 2020,positive,it distresses me that this film is being seen as promoting rather than denigrating the sexualization of young girls  i suspect many who give negative reviews watched the film with their minds already made up or worse never watched it at all     this is an excellent film by a new and talented director
Sep 18 2020,positive,many people are trashing this film but this movie has many layers and is a must see for parents of daughters growing up in todays world the main plot is very culture specific but easily relatable to mothers and daughters of the world todayif we are honest with ourselves and paying any attention at all to the world around us
Sep 18 2020,positive,great coming of age movie
Sep 18 2020,negative,i went into this movie with an unbiased outlook on things yet it did not help as i feel the production director and editors made a few big mistakes i understand what the director may have been trying to achieve but it did not come out the way or be received by the audience in the way she may have thought the  shot list and hypersexualization of 11 year olds is wrong there were many choices in the editing and framing that they couldve adjusted to still have an empowering affect on the modern day coming of age and testing socialreligious boundaries unfortunately the message is lost as they made it too sexually obvious which makes it disturbing for the audience to see girls sexualized at such a young age
Sep 18 2020,positive,a matter of days ago i welcomed my first child into the world a girl with this comes a rush of fear for a father of the unknown and hurtful things that i might have to shield her from however i want fathers and parents to embrace this film yes it has shocking material but this film reveals what are kids are dealing with an unapologetic lens more than that it follows a young immigrant girl and her family which brings its own different set of pressures and problems to conform what i took from the film was that no matter what background you come from whether it is conservative or liberal young people are exposed to things that will rush that transition from childhood to adulthood it blurs the lines and we can all imagine how confusing and stressful that must be with an age of technology what can i do as a father listen listen to cues listen to their needs and always try to tune in rather than perform a makeshift exorcism that way we can have those uncomfortable conversations to prepare them for what it truly means to be an adult and hopefully this will help them cherish their childhood a little longer
Sep 18 2020,negative,i get what the director wanted to do but the movie hardly reflected that
Sep 17 2020,positive,this is a classic coming of age film  life shown from the eyes of preteen girls living in a world where access to social media is unfettered struggling to understand what being a woman means or how to become a woman  it is hard to watch them struggle with these concepts hard to watch them make choices that are beyond their years and understanding hard because i know this is real life this is what school and adolescence has become and its never easy to look in the mirror and not like what you see
Sep 17 2020,negative,it is heartwrenching that these young actresses have been sexually exploited to purportedly make a point that all parents already know worse than bottom of the barrel garbage no matter how slickly produced its attempting to use beauty to disguise blatant evil has it ever occurred to anyone that sex portrayed onscreen leads to tragic levels of real world violence abortion  sexual exploitation violent porn etc please lets stop being such hypocrites
Sep 17 2020,positive,point its trying to say is good but the plot is somewhat confusing
Sep 17 2020,positive,oh my goodness i just watched this movie and i want to say what a beautiful film that was i mean i can relate to this movie on so many levels except i was a teenager about 20 years ago so i cant even imagine what kind of pressure young girls are going through nowadays this movie made me laugh cry and empathize deeply with the main character we as women have ongoing pressures of what we need to look like what we need to do what we need to saywhen you go on youtube tiktok etc there is a some sort of twerking happening everywhere so therefore that is the message we as women are getting right im seeing this movie as a sad truth of our reality art reflecting life this is where we are right now and yes teenage girls feel pressure to dance in a sexual way in order for them to find identify and build their confidence this is a coming of age story though it is not cliché it is modern it is scary it is sad it is beautifulit is real this film is worthy of all the high praise that it has gotten from film critics all over the world
Sep 17 2020,positive,i just learned about a francosenegalese film called mignonnes theres a big controversy about it first my take its unclear if aminata was born in senegal or france but she is a preteen in an unnamed french city she and her family live in a housing project whose residents are mostly immigrants her muslim mother and auntie are very traditional they take ami amy to mosque and teach her how to cook amy is starting a new school and is both harassed by and intrigued by the mean girls a dance gang led by angelica who looks like she has fetal alcohol syndrome their little dance group is called mignonnes which literally means cuties but im still going to call them the mean girls they wear skimpy clothes and talk about older boys and practice sexy dance moves in hopes of entering a local dance group competition angelica and amy live in the same housing project and become friends amy aspires to be one of the cool kids and joins the dance group in secret the controversy is in the burgeoning sexuality of amy and the mean girls amy is breaking away from the conservative culture in which she is being raised she swipes a cell phone and discovers instagram and selfies and sexualized videos and twerking amy is curious about sexuality about boys and girls and herself she doesnt want to spend all day chopping onions and looking after her obnoxious little brother she wants the likes she gets on the internet and finds that the more provocative the dance move the more popular the video becomes this is the controversy the film depicts these 8th graders doing the seductive dance moves in shortshorts and midriffs the film has been called child pornography probably by people who didnt see it while a couple of scenes could have been edited differently this is a serious drama about loneliness and conflict amy crosses a line then another then another and she doesnt know when to stop until even the mean girls tell her that she went too far amy is caught between a family culture in which women are oppressed and the modern internet culture in which women are exploited this child is trying to find her way and is yearning for love and support and guidance
Sep 17 2020,positive,an outstanding film that deals with uncomfortable subjects beautifully crafted and thought provoking im glad netflix has chosen to keep this movie available despite the pressure to remove it controversy aside cuties is a remarkable piece of film making
Sep 17 2020,positive,wed sept 16    my review of netflix movie cuties    i had been hearing about a disgusting and controversial movie on netflix that glorifies sexualizing children but i hadnt actually found anyone who had seen the movie so being someone who likes watching controversial films i decided to give it a go    first off it was nothing like i expected it to be    it was a genuinely sweet movie that is on point with its addressing of controversial issues such as growing up with smartphones and the hypersexualization of women    unfortunately the film had a number of things working against it    its a french art film that is a coming of age story about a little black muslim tween girls search for acceptance from friends and family while dealing with the hormonal changes and sexual curiousity that comes with being a tween girl that doesnt speak english or live in america  fortunately for american audiences the movie is overdubbed with the voices of allamerican girls  unfortunately out of the 5 girls that the story follows only one of them is white and shes more of a background character in the group    but its a dance movie    and who doesnt like dance movies    anyway spoilers love    the movie begins by following amy a french tween girl living in a conservative muslim household who lives in the modern age with modern technology    she sees a group of 4 girls dancing stalks them for a while gets called out and eventually wins them over and joins them as a part of their group    the girls act like every other teen girl in the world acts by chasing after older boys pretending to be older than they are dancing singing and being goofy children trying their damndest to be grown up    being a tween girl amy enjoys listening to music and watching videos that hypersexualize women because that is the society in which we live and that is the highest form of art in this day and age    shaking titties and ass    she copies these moves teaches them to her friends and they enter into a dance competition in which children are hypersexualized    amy begins to dress and act more provocatively as she continues to copy the actions and dress like the women that she sees in music videos    as amys hypersexual experimentation continues to make a downward spiral she attempts to seduce her adult male cousin and when he denies her advances she uses his phone to post a naked image of herself online and is immediately called out by her classmates for being a slut and by her family for dressing and acting like a whore  she is then denounced and ostracised by her friends because they dont want to be seen as sluts    her friends kick her out of the dance troupe and she tries desperately to regain their favor  her grandmother calls in a priest to have her exorcised and is told that there is nothing wrong with her  she pushes one of her friends into a river almost drowning her so that she could take her place in the dance competition     during the competition the girls dance sluttily as the camera zooms in on a number of women making disapproving faces and covering the eyes of their children    finally after everything thats happened amy has a breakdown and the veil is lifted from her eyes she resumes dressing like a child and the movie ends on her happily jumping rope having just regained her childhood    while this movie does touch on the hypersexualization of children it stands out as a social commentary denouncing this practice ive seen the subject matter portrayed far worse on basic american television  this movie is lighthearted but it takes the subject matter seriously  there are shows in this country that praise the hypersexualization of children making it funny mindless entertainment while this movie once you get down to the nitty gritty is in no way glorifying the hypersexualization of children but rather addressing the issue of young girls imitating what they see adults doing and calling out those who encourage it    dont get me wrong the movie will make you uncomfortable at parts because it perfectly documents what its like to be a modern teen girl who is repressed curious and looking for acceptance as for so many kids its a sad lonely confusing existence    a lot of the things featured in this movie are happening right now as i type this little girls are taking pictures of their crotches to send to random men tween girls are losing their virginity or being raped by family members little girls are dressed slutty and paraded around town by their parents little girls are being sold into slavery so that old men can get their jollies  we live in a sick world  its disgusting yet its still socially acceptable for the sake of american entertainment and thats the point the movie is trying to make    after watching this movie i have come to the conclusion that if after watching the film your only take away was that the movie is glorifying the sexualization of children rather than bringing it to light and looking down upon it you might either be racist sexist xenophobic a sheep too ignorant to understand the message a pedophile or a combination of the above    seriously though its a good movie you should check it out and form your own opinion rather than let randos on the internet tell you to boycott a movie that you havent seen and have no room criticizing     note i am not a teenage girl nor do i know what its like to be a teen girl but i have observed teen girls as a teenager and during the 9 years that i worked as a camp counselor and have heard countless stories of what its like growing up as a teenager so while my information and experience isnt firsthand i still have a pretty good idea as to whats going on
Sep 17 2020,positive,it is about exactly how the description describes it personally i have seen far worse displays of dancing which are being actively watched by 11 year olds our kids are already growing up too fast to be disgusted with this movie for what it portrays is a sad statement on how well parents are aware of what their children are being exposed to this would be a great movie for parents to watch with their soon to be teenagers to help with the discussion of the pressures they will be facing as a parent when your daughters enter their teenage years you may no longer have the active ability to approve or not to what they are exposed to dont worry parents the ending is happy
Sep 17 2020,positive,i absolutely loved this film it handled very delicately and realistically the modern issues confronting young women it was multicultural multi racial and multi faceted they left nothing out when i saw it trending on twitter i decided to see what all the hype was about expecting to see who knows this is a tremendously important film and handles so many layers of growing up in the age of social media   all of the child actors performed their roles impeccably the story was breathtaking and at times uncomfortable but no more than toddlers and tiaras and little miss sunshine the fact that people are cancelling their netflix subscriptions is just stupid if the lead character in the film was white people wouldnt be so offended for some reason people really cant handle not being in control of black bodies the biggest threat to the security of americans is a sexually empowered black woman   these kids were dealing with so many issues and in the end they were just little girls trying to figure out the complex world of prepubescent adolescence i watched it twice
Sep 17 2020,positive,this movie is about the double standards for young girls to be regarding sexualization it is also about what it is like to begin adolescence in a dualsociety the conservative religious upbringing of amys family versus the joy of being seen and accepted even attractive and wanted from the world of her peers  amy is so desperate for a place to belong not uncommon at all in young girls that she goes from one extreme to another she has no guidance for what is too far other than what her peers show her and the messages are extremely mixed spoiler by the end she is shown to be searching for a middle ground  it is a story of growth experimentation and making mistakes the sexy scenes are intentionally uncomfortable to watch and it is about young girls dealing with the mixed messages of their world being told that being attractive and sexy is where your worth lies but dont be a slut    the film is not perfect  there are some hanging plot threads  but it is ultimately a grotesquely honest look at the world young girls live in now 1011 year olds have a desire to be accepted and belong and this film shows the dark side of this and the need for education without repression
Sep 17 2020,positive,i guess rotten tomatoes has gotten away from requiring proof that reviewers actually saw the movie before rating it at least with streaming movies this is a brilliant movie a heartfelt story of a young girls discovery of what young womanhood means amy a senegalese girl in paris is struggling with finding her role in the world in light of her father has taken a second wife a multiple marriage allowed in their culture she is a member of a strict temple where she is told that most women go to hell meanwhile she wants to fit in with the cool girls and be seen as attractive yes parts of this movie are uncomfortable much the way eighth grade was uncomfortable but as with eighth grade the reason viewers are uncomfortable has a lot to do with the fact that remembering those years is uncomfortable watch the entire movie and then form an opinion
Sep 17 2020,positive,hard to watch in the choreographys i think it is what kids was in 2000 a very scandalous movie about the sexuality of prepubescent kids certainly the timming was not the best for current world events however is not far from reality young girls want to be sexual in all social media is infested of oversexualized pictures videos and choreographys of prepubescent girls being cuties so there is an outrage because of this movie many people asking to take it down from netflix i have mixed opinions and as a once young girl i can easily identify with this characters
Sep 17 2020,positive,this is an excellent movie do not listen to the negative reviews of those who have not even seen it the acting is amazing and the director did a wonderful job showing the difficulty the main character is going through some of the scenes are uncomfortable to watch but it is an important subject matter to think about instead of being so upset at the movie it should be a cautionary tale about what young kids are watching on social media they try to imitate what they see adults doing on social media and dont even understand the ramifications of their actions parents need to monitor what their kids watch and talk to their kids about the things they see on social media in no way is this movie exploiting children
Sep 16 2020,negative,i went into this movie with an unbiased outlook on things yet it did not help as i feel the production director and editors made a big mistake i understand what the director may have been trying to achieve but it did not come out the way or be received by the audience in the way she may have thought the choice in shot list and hypersexualization of 11 year olds was the wrong choice there were many choices in the editing and framing that they couldve adjusted to still have an empowering affect on the modern day coming of age and testing socialreligious boundaries unfortunately it makes you uncomfortable and the message is lost as they made it too sexually obvious which makes it disturbing for the audience to see girls sexualized at such a young age
Sep 16 2020,positive,after hearing such awful reviews by everyone and everyone having an opinion without actually watching the movie i decided to form my own opinion i watched it with hesitation already expecting the worst   let me just put this out there this movie is not for dimwits   the movie imo explores a realistic approach to oppression and how the new generations are trying to surpass it   i heard people saying how the movie was glorifying pedophilia thats not the case who ever came up with that conclusion is closed minded and couldnt see through the actual message     watch the movie and form your own opinion stop following the crowd
Sep 16 2020,positive,no nudity some shots were a little borderline but if the movie was about a bunch of boys at that age and if it was a comedy nobody would care  the reason people are upset is that their own kids are probably doing this and they are too blind to see
Sep 16 2020,positive,fantastic movie thats disturbing at times but within reason  well acted a bit slow going to start but very powerful  a must for parents to help understand the pressures facing teens and preteens in our social media world
Sep 16 2020,negative,i am not reviewbombing this movie  rottentomatoes gives you hints on what a certain amount of stars mean and cuties is way below the meh it passed the time category    but lets differentiate between the movie and the netflix marketing campaign theres no sugarcoating it the marketing campaign was despicable and might as well represent a soft erotic film about underage girls    but what about the movie    underage sexuality is a complex and controversial topic and i might have protected the movie if it tackled the issue in a smart thought provoking way    after all we have donnie darko commenting on coming of age teenage angst and alienation we have little miss sunshine that comments on our mania to win and on child sexualization at beauty pageants we have the end of the fucking world that shows hostile alienated teenagers in a hostile alienating world    cuties is not one of those movies    cuties is grotesque in its representation  showing extremes only  onesided in its criticism  while it shows extreme cases of sexualization of children in western society it shies away from showing extreme cases of religious fundamentalism the other opposing force  and hamfisted in its message    the worst thing about the movie is the ending the character does things which should have longterm implications for their future she clearly behaves like a person with severe mental health issues and lack of empathy yet its a she found the truth and lived happily ever after kind of an ending imagine if the first rambo movie ended with people gathering and overwhelming the police and john rambo becoming the president of america wouldnt make sense right cuties has that kind of an ending    if you want to watch a good movie skip it and watch something else
Sep 16 2020,positive,a great exploration of what young girls face in this era of oversexualization and social media
Sep 16 2020,positive,a thoughtprovoking cautionary tale show the things that many would like to ignore
Sep 16 2020,positive,ignore the bad reviews this movie is so well done the actors and actresses are incredible and the message behind it is very moving definitely see
Sep 16 2020,positive,this film serves as and important reminder of the struggles todays youth face and how diligent parents and care taker must be in protecting and properly educating our young people in the age of social media and cell phones
Sep 16 2020,positive,this little film has been highly criticized i think unfairly its a story about a pubescent girl longing to be accepted who tries to fit in with her friends by emulating the suggested moves of the overtly suggestive dancing that they think makes them desirable and cool unfortunately this only succeeds in bringing shame and further confusion and alienation spoiler in the end the girl decides shes happiest just being young and able to play jump rope with the other kids in the neighborhood cute story and rightonthemoney with the preteen angst the morallystarved modern world creates
Sep 16 2020,positive,i thought it was an exceptional film  the acting and cultural immersion were the best parts for me  the theme was raw and real but i did feel a bit repetitive and overdone regarding the sexual dance style the girls learned  still doesnt keep me from highly recommending it
Sep 16 2020,positive,the film was a mostly wellmade attempt to show the struggles of a tween girl who rejects the traditional repressive culture of her mother in which women must obey their husbands and tolerate husbands taking other wives but then enters the hypersexualized internet culture in which porn is available to children and young girls believe that becoming sex objects is the way to fun and popularity in this case through a dance contest    the film depicts both worlds as undesirable but we have to see a lot of bumping and grinding from 11yearolds which was almost impossible to watch before the final short redemptive scenes the film would have been better  and still would have made its uncomfortable point  if the camera hadnt insisted on frequent closeups of the childrens wiggling backsides    but the film does make its point both cultures are repressive in their own ways forcing girls and women into roles that arent natural to them for the purpose of pleasing men who control their minds as well as their bodies the ending provides the relief of true freedom an escape from both cultures and a turning point in the girls life with her mothers blessing for that the films problems are almost forgivable im still torn about it
Sep 16 2020,positive,this is reality for girls growing up and all your puritanical reactions of outrage only further prove the films point    this is what youre doing to children and no amount of banning is going to fix it only make it worse
Sep 16 2020,positive,this movie was so raw adorable heartbreaking and beautiful god forbid a film dare to portray accurately the dangers and experience of girlhood maybe they just dont want us to talk about
Sep 16 2020,positive,when i saw the overall negative reaction given by social media i just had to figure out what it was that was making everyone so angry    i was pleasantly surprised by such a challenging film to watch as this one the blatant and out there style of presenting such a beautiful message as this made me extraordinarily squeamish i had to turn my head away from the screen multiple times but everytime i did so i realized just how much of this was the fault of myself and society     the themes expressed are such a harsh thing to look at without any filters that doesnt change how much of a problem it is though and the film does an amazing job of walking that line of are they really going to do it are they really going to push this message that hard everytime they do it you learn to sit through it and then the next time the up the ante    the problems are compounded one on another and it ends up making a leaning tower of piza for our protagonist to maneuver around the saddest part of it all is that this is what generations to come are going to experience in mass and are already experiencing it
Sep 15 2020,negative,i went into this movie trying to give it the benefit of the doubt despite all the negative commotion surrounding it and the way it put these little girls on screen i went into the movie hoping it wouldnt be as everyone feared cause the trailers werent that bad the first 5 minutes were fine almost everything after that was an absolute no for me
Sep 15 2020,negative,really bad and boring third bad show on netflix so i canceled my membership
Sep 15 2020,positive,it was heartbreaking and painful to watch and that is the whole point of the movie if you watch it and come away with the message that sexualizing children is okay then honestly you should seek therapy i dont mean that as an insult  i mean it with earnest    this movie should be required watching for all parents but especially parents of young girls unlike other comingofage pieces it does not glamorize youth theres no magic fix to the pain amy goes through the creator does an amazing job at making you truly feel what amy is going through while watching it i felt sad heartbroken confused dirty gross ashamed and above all compassionate    this is not a film about sexualizing kids it is a film about understanding and protecting them adequately its about what happens when parents are lost in their own lives and kids are raised by the internet its about performing what you think people want from you without understanding the context at all    watch it
Sep 15 2020,negative,tackling the subject of girls being sexualized by modern music and dance requires a skilled surgeon with a scalpel this movie got a lumberjack with a sledgehammer   this movie goes from painfully boring to horribly offensive to shockingly dumb
Sep 15 2020,negative,the inappropriate behavior contradicts every point they were trying to make
Sep 15 2020,positive,worth watching  i only wish the camera hadnt focused so much on the girls anatomy maybe it would have been less controversial  the message of the story is poignant  great acting and atmosphere
Sep 15 2020,positive,this is a beautiful film the plot cinematography acting and overall commentary are superb bravo
Sep 15 2020,negative,wildly inappropriate
Sep 15 2020,negative,worst movie ever i get the message but not the best way to go let alone making into a movie do not recommend it to any one
Sep 15 2020,negative,it doesnt matter how you present bad material or what light you attempt to cast on it its just wrong
Sep 15 2020,negative,it was bad so much worse than i expected
Sep 15 2020,positive,heartbreaking and provocativea searing indictment of the intertwined strands of sexism and racism in modern western culture absolute must watch
Sep 15 2020,positive,great film no a masterpiece but it works its about being a child and making mistakes
Sep 15 2020,negative,what a tough and uncomfortable movie to sit through
Sep 15 2020,negative,it was different than i was expecting the netflix cover took one of the worst parts of the movie i was uncomfortable with the whole subject but i also didnt grow up like that and i got the impression that feeling was the point
Sep 15 2020,positive,after 90 minutes of the movie i feel pleased of having taken that time to actually listen to the message it seems as an oversexualized group of little girls doing adult stuff but is a movie about what young girls actually do is telling a true story apparently everyone wants to ignore or just blame on men that we know they are pigs but as usual not all of them as a 20yearold i have seen it around me since really young girls wearing makeup and painting their fingernails at 1011 years drinking at 12 and is not their fault they have access to the internet and today the internet has wap everywhere they sing and dance as adults without understanding what they are actually doing tiktok is the living proof of that but its better to blame netflix than actually working on better communication with kids and giving them safe spaces to understand what they are actually doing before putting 0 starts to it take the time to actually listen
Sep 15 2020,positive,great movie its boldly touch the topic the young kids face the pressure of social media and loose their childhood hats off to director  and her team great movie 
Sep 15 2020,positive,i thought the movie was a great example of someone struggling to fit in and finds girls who have very little parent involvement in their life they are tryin go to be what every 11 year old wants to be older yet they have no adult guidance or discussion about social media
Sep 15 2020,positive,i thought it was really worth seeing the director was clearly making this movie based on their own experience it was wellobserved written shot and edited whoever thinks this is pornography is a prude andor doesnt understand the concept of social commentary
Sep 15 2020,negative,ugh  sexualsocial commentary or not this film was like an over stuffed suit case that burst at the seams with the contents spilling out all over the place  i get what it was trying to do but in the end anything original or meaningful was completely lost in the mess except maybe the fact that it made me feel uncomfortable before i got bored   one star for making me feel uncomfortable and one for a wonderful performance by fathia youssouf
Sep 15 2020,positive,its really crude hard to watch but good
Sep 15 2020,negative,this was a sad movie really  a young girl stuck between two lousy cultures  there is nothing for her to hang on to  miserable home life miserable school life fraying social structure   an example of globalism at its worst  as far as the twerking stuff goes  young girls can see that on any tv show or facebook  look at cardo b and the megan thee stallion lady  pretty bad examples there  worries me
Sep 15 2020,negative,read what the director said watched the movie so that i could make an informed opinion unfortunately it is everything the vast majority of people claim it to be completely misses the mark
Sep 15 2020,positive,this movie is a coming of age cautionary tale about a girl torn between her ovebearing religious family and peer pressure from her new friends this morals of the movie are very much against sexual exploitation i know this because i actually watched the movie
Sep 15 2020,positive,the plot is that a young girl 11 amy has learned that sex sells she and her friends do not know anything about sex being a woman or anything sexual at all but know that older girls and what they see on the internet gets a lot of likes so they emulate what they see amy growing up in a muslim senegalese household in paris is learning that following the tradition of the women in her family  being one of multiple wives being betrothed at age 11 may seem fine to other women because it is a tradition but she knows her mother is so miserable at the fact her husband is bringing another wife home that she falls ill amy seems to despise her mom for this she goes from innocent child to doing everything she can to prove she is a woman but with childlike naiveté        the film is ok the actors are amazing but some of the story falls flat as the directors point is made but some of the message is in your face  like with the dress amy is supposed to wear at her fathers wedding its like a sudden clap of thunder in a horror movie i get it there seems to be a lot of back story that she brushes on with the other girls but it never really gets covered        as for the controversy sigh if i thought the film was amazing i would say all that have been up in arms about the film to actually watch it yes the girls in the film dance provocatively that is the point they are doing what they see in life and entertainment in amys case she is trying not to end up like her mother her friend is not getting attention from her parents the larger friend is trying to be sexy and she even pukes in a bathroom to try to be thinner        then i read about the film netflix messed up big time with the marketing the poster they used for the film whereas not as outrageous as others think was far different than the original poster showing the girls skipping down the street after a shopping spree oh and i saw one post saying a young girl lifted up her shirt exposing herself on screen nope        child porn nope reflection of what our girls see yup    when my daughter was younger oh about 11 and i could only find booty shorts for her because they only make them short for young girls at the same time have you seen a school dress code what girls cannot wear because it is sexual and distracts from learning        i just wish this film would have been better with the message but its close
Sep 15 2020,positive,i watched it and i thought it was just a heartbreaking movie about a muslim girl in a new place trying to fit in while her whole family dynamic is changing  unfortunately the way the world is girls think that they need to be sexy to be worth anything  i found most of the dancing nothing new cheerleaders  in competitions or in beauty pageants do the same moves  i thought the ending was awesome  where amy found a balance between the world and who she was  and she found a happy place between sexy and conservative dress and the joy of jump roping in my opinion the backlash is over the top for this movie and unwarranted
Sep 15 2020,negative,the only reason i give this film 2 stars instead of none is that the lead actress actually did a great job of showing how detrimental hypersexualization of young girls via social media actually is even if the many scenes of 11 year olds twerking were unsettling     the film attempts to shed light onto the hyper sexualization of young children online and show its damaging affects the main problem is that they use actual minors dressed very provocatively and have them dance in ways they definitely shouldnt its essentially abuse
Sep 15 2020,positive,just finished watching netflixs controversial cuties  it is disappointing that the true message from the movie is missed  there is a certainly reason for the outcry regarding the provocative element in this movie thats just exactly what you and i as parents need to recognize about our children in this instant my daughters and granddaughters will have to face similar situations  will my christian moral truths hold relevance as they face todays harsh world social media tik tok instagram etc they are the tantalizing tempting weapons against our kids  here are my personal  takeaways from this movie i pray that i will be there for my girls and grandsons to help them deal and cope with our degrading world   it is well into the movie where you will find inappropriate risqué and what i consider sexual innuendo promoted  i fast forwarded disturbing i also mention all the prime time commercials and tv that promote just as inflammatory and provocative material  the following is true to what is revealed and dealt with in cuties   your familys socio and economic situation is poor   how do our kids deal with that now is my child facing that stigma are we poor or rich   bullying peer pressure is a key element introduced at the onset as amy main character begins a new school  its the same hostile pressure so many of our children face daily  homeless because you dont have the right clothes the right hair youre an outsider   strict religious and cultural differences put added pressure on  amy to fit in and try to hide her desire to tread both waters   what will and how far will my child daughter go to fit in will she totally do away with all weve taught her  her friends will encourage her to discard her upbringing   am i too consumed with my own personal problems to see my childs suffering   redemption amy embraces her truth i cant give the ending away
Sep 14 2020,neutral,its not as bad as what everybody thinks and yes their is some pretty disgusting stuff in this with 11 year old girls doing some pretty adult stuff and yes i can admit its nasty and shouldnt have been in here but at the same time this is a french movie so of course itll be crazy but still this is 2020 so that doesnt mean 11 year old girls can do this type of stuff and 18 is the consent age in america i dont know what it is in france so i dont know if theyre parents signed off saying that its ok for them to do it then thats a different story but as the non bias reviewer that i am this movie surprisingly not just all adult stuff its actually a very tragic and sad story the main girl is so sad and her parents in the movie got divorced and shes having a hard time making friends and wants to be more so she joins the bad kids club and she just wants to fit in this is a very personal emotional movie even though it is very perverted and disturbing at times its both and this controversial movie wasnt as bad as what everybody is saying but its still pretty out of the world anyway i think if youre just hating on this movie only off of the trailer just watch the movie to get the whole picture
Sep 14 2020,negative,a truly bad and really shameful movie
Sep 14 2020,negative,the crowd at the end had the right idea about this movie while i can grasp what the writer was trying to say the entire premise was lost due to the directing and filming it was gratuitous and quite appalling in many places  it missed the mark and what was meant to be what seemed like a comingofage movie became pedofuel instead  warning of the dangers of doing whatever it takes to be socially accepted and avoiding the lure of social media stardom by way of selfprostitution and child exploitation the movie ends up doing both with no real consequence no lesson learned  further whatever message was meant to steer children away from this type of behavior will be lost given the movie was rated for mature audiences only and no children should be viewing it  it makes me wonder who exactly this movie was made for
Sep 14 2020,positive,worth a watch  its thought provoking and shows a very complex dynamic of growing up trying to fit in and how the pressures are to act older
Sep 14 2020,positive,art imitates life in this movie its an uncomfortable yet very real topic of what some young girls life experiences are it toggles back and forth between young girls being girls and then young girls feeling the need to be seen as attractive because of everything they see on social media knowledge is power and this movie is very powerful and can hopefully make a positive impact on how we raise our children in the age of social media 
Sep 14 2020,negative,generally terrible disturbing at points
Sep 14 2020,positive,this is an amazing story acted incredibly well by the young cast is it rough to watch at moments yes but what else are films for than to open our eyes to stories around the globe that make us understand one another more
Sep 14 2020,positive,first of watch it fully before you judge  i think is very profound and thought provoking and definitely a good tool of discussion for girls and their parents especially in the time of  social media being the essential moral compass of self image the story transcends across cultures race and religions and brings light to the hyper sexualization  of girls starting at a young age not exploit  and as a young black girl in america i related to a lot of situations white being better  as a teen try to be black in a dominated   immigrant community and high school i cold go on and on please watch before u judge
Sep 14 2020,negative,the movie cuties is so problematic its trying to send a message that child sexualization is harmful while also sexualizing children you cannot actively show the sexualization of children and claim to be against it thats not how this works there are ways to show how harmful stuff like this is without doing the exact same thing you claim to be against shame on the parents of these children for even letting them be in this movie and shame on netflix for greenlighting it providing a platform for it and actively promoting it
Sep 14 2020,positive,i loved this movie so much the backlash is from people who havent seen it its amazing and important
Sep 14 2020,positive,a serious movie that addresses an important issue in a thoughtful way  intelligent and respectful of the characters particularly the children
Sep 14 2020,negative,i wanted to watch cuties because there was so much hate towards the movie and i have to say its justified as good as the storyline may be it doesnt excuse the sexualizing of kids the dance moves the close ups the nudity was shocking i can appreciate what the director is trying to say but this was the absolute wrong way of doing it i dont recommend anyone watch it
Sep 14 2020,negative,eh honestly not sure what to think about this one
Sep 14 2020,negative,the film takes a sordid route to critique parental neglect and social medias power to corrupt the young
Sep 14 2020,positive,i cannot say it is enjoyable it is a coming of age film set in the paris housing projects as a former teacher i have encountered these sorts of kids they think they are mature older than their years they are not they are still kids the film is told from the young girls point of view and this is disturbing to most americans many have called the film kiddie porn it is startling in the approach but the kids helped the female director make the film realistic if the subject bothers you dont view it
Sep 14 2020,positive,you would need to watch the movie before you judge it it shows the conflicts she lives as a muslim who is black as well as a 11 year old she wanted to figure out herself away from her mothers religious ideas and starts hanging out with the dance crewcuties and later finds out she doesnt want to dance it shows ideas that are happening in society even though it might not be seen as much irl
Sep 14 2020,negative,absolutely shocking this was even allowed to be broadcast  exploitation of children 
Sep 14 2020,positive,its not what the internet has made it out to be cuties is in fact a film about a preteen who discovers that shed rather be her age than acting like an adult she finds this out the hard way of course and the provocative scenes will make you uncomfortable but the payoff is touching
Sep 14 2020,negative,its a ridiculous exploitation of children  if i could give it zero stars i would
Sep 14 2020,negative,i can see where they were trying to go with it but it was executed really poorly
Sep 14 2020,positive,i dont think i would have watched cuties had it not been for all the controversy but then i was just too curious to not judge for myself  i have to say that i highly  recommend it and understand why it has won awards i dont want to write  too much because i dont want to spoil anything but i can say that  there are definitely some scenes that are pretty uncomfortable to watch  this movie is clearly filmed from a perspective of being critical of  the sexualization of girls but it goes deeper than criticism in its  attempts to really dissect how a girl from a traditional family and a  group of other innocent kids ended up twerking and humping the floor it  also explores what tradition demands of us and what  it offers  us in exchange this film challenges us to ask where is the line what  will we do to escape to fit in and to push the boundaries the  directorial use of clothing as if the clothes themselves are alive is  brilliant by the end of the film its hard to not identify with  practically every character  that being said i thought the ending was a bit too neat put this on your watch list but it is not a  movie for kids
Sep 14 2020,positive,not for people who cant handle complexity an adolescent girl tries to navigate puberty family issues and a new culture with nothing but media as a role model she is drawn to the toughest coolest girls in her school and emulates and then eventually outdoes them trying to fit in the story is difficult and your heart aches for young amy theres nothing salacious about this film its awkward and painful as is the journey of the protagonist this same story plays out over and over in the us for young girls so im surprised that rather than face this as an issue people are reacting with outrage theres nothing titillating about this film and the dance moves and costumes are no more explicit than what you often see teen girls wearing or doing in pageants dance recitals or high school halftime shows here the ending is also an incredibly hopeful turning point
Sep 14 2020,positive,a very accurate and current portrayal of the balancing act pre teen girlsteens go through the juxtaposition of mental innocence to physical and emotional changes as well as the girls growing understanding of large picture issues like religion parental or familiar relationships and self worth which is often defined by social media set to the roller coaster that is the social cast system of school and home life  this movie is about pushing boundaries at that age sometimes for attention but also due to naïveté its about comfort or lack there of or how we seek comfort in both healthy and unhealthy ways
Sep 14 2020,positive,this movie empowers women and girls and that is how i felt when i saw this movie i know a lot of parents that want to cover their children with baggie clothes and not even let them wear chapstick or play with makeup and i watched some friends of mine get beat for wanting to wear heels or just be pretty so as they grew older they would hide it from their parents they would change clothes at school and wear makeup then wipe it off when they got home its ok to explore our femininity and feel free
Sep 14 2020,positive,cuties is a moving thoughtful french film made by writerdirector maïmouna doucouré a senegalesefrench woman the story was in part inspired by her own experience growing up in two cultures senegalese at home and western outside she also interviewed over 100 girls in researching her film   people  who havent even seen the film  have revolted against it and netflix based solely on that first misleading poster people are sending maïmouna doucouré death threats canceling netflix and badreview bombing the film everywhere all without ever seeing the film  why is this film and the filmmaker being so reviled and attacked what has been triggered here  and im wondering if this film were american made by a white man would it be receiving any backlash  ive watched the film its wonderful its brilliantly written directed and acted its heartwarming heartbreaking moving funny and yes at times uncomfortable to watch but there is absolutely nothing wrong with it and i speak as someone who works with sexual trauma and abuse every day i speak as a feminist and someone that wants to see girls and women empowered  as i believe the filmmaker wants as well and having been an 11 yearold girl i identified i feel my girlexperiences authentically captured and movingly portrayed no we didnt have twerking in my day  but we certainly had other things  i see this movie as an honest authentic empowering female film is that what is so threatening watch it and decide for yourself yes it might make you uncomfortable at times why is that a bad thing the sexualizing that people are so concerned about is not coming from the filmmaker  she is reflecting what is in society and how girls both express and cope as well as what she has experienced herself if you want to be outraged then look at our advertising look at how women and girls are treated  and depicted still in movies written by and for men   if you watch the movie and like it please support it and maïmouna doucouré give it a thumbs up on netflix a 10 on imdb rate it high on rotten tomatoes and elsewhere  can we just celebrate this womans work now  cuties maïmounadoucouré
Sep 14 2020,negative,a difficult topic to criticize in film format cuties doesnt quite communicate its message as it far too often emphasizes the grotesque without enough of the repercussions  worse still it only glosses over the fact that this is something which continues to  manifest in business social media and unethical encouragement it impacts everyone involved  the result is a film that forces the audience to remain uncomfortable without enough time for them to understand why this film was even made to begin with
Sep 14 2020,negative,i understand the conversation going around that there is a message behind this movie  and that the movie is being unfairly bashed  but after seeing it no you cannot sexualize children in a movie that claims to bring awareness of sexualizing children  these girls are 1113 years old  the dancing clothing themes and body language are insanely inappropriate for children in this age range  here is a thought you want to bring awareness dont sexualize children in the process  the message of the movie could have been expressed a thousand different ways  older actresses less up front shots of all these girls body parts during the dance scenes come on
Sep 14 2020,negative,cuties is as much a social commentary against the sexualization of young children as willy wonka is a social commentary against the excessive eating of candy  no augustus gloop doesnt count
Sep 14 2020,positive,very well done unlike most who comment on this ive actually watched it the moral panic and hysteria over this is completely unjustified i thought the young actress did a great job anyone who conflates this with child pornography should look inward
Sep 13 2020,negative,extremely inappropriate
Sep 13 2020,positive,cuties is a great movie about an adolescent girl trying to navigate puberty fitting in and being noticed by her peers and being her authentic self while inside of a household that adheres to a very different viewpoint and expression of womanhood
Sep 13 2020,positive,if watching this film makes you uncomfortable you should ask yourself why it points the mirror back at the viewer to evoke discussion about childhood and growing up in the age of social media and the expectations of girls to grow up without any explanations on how to navigate these lanes  this asks many questions and tries to answer them     is it perfect no however it is a good place to start
Sep 13 2020,negative,movies tackling difficult issues that are hard to watch can be good movies this movie is trying to address the issue of children sexually exploiting themselves online and in their real lives without understanding the consequences of their actions it achieves that purpose but undoubtedly exploits its young actresses and exposes them to the exact harm the movie addresses
Sep 13 2020,positive,at first i believed all the accusations and so resolved to watch it thinking to confirm my bias against this movie i was surprised to see a coming of age story about a girl and her true to life struggles of wanting to fit in and discovering her sexuality children at this age are curious and begin to explore and what this movie portrays in an honest manner is this exploration which is a part of our human experience children have played doctors and nurses since the beginning of time this movie is not even portraying any of that sexual exploration but just the desire for young children to emulate what they see in society and on social media everyday the backlash against this movie is unfounded this movie is similar in vein to lord of the flies and forces us to face some unwelcome truths about our society and its foibles
Sep 13 2020,positive,a thoughtful coming of age movie of a preteen senegalese immigrant recently moved to the banlieus of paris caught between her cultures constricting expectations of womanhood and the seemingly liberating expectations of western instagram culture she looks for friendship and finds a multicultural group of girls in a similar position stuck between sweet and mean innocence and experience they explore with and for each other not men or boys a world of tiny tshirts short shorts and twerking hip hop dance contests and she first enticed and then a leader the film is slow complex critical and thoughtprovoking if you liked the florida project think of those children a little bit older
Sep 13 2020,negative,this movie shouldnt be a thing
Sep 13 2020,positive,a great story about a young female character finding her own voice i can recommend it to fans of films like wadjda or little miss sunshine
Sep 13 2020,positive,it is sad to see so many miss the point of this movie it is clear that the message sent is to portrait what happens when kids are overly influenced by social and religious pressure when all they want are to be kids seeing the poor ratings tells me that adults arent brave enough to face their own wrong doing in many ways it is disturbing how easily the world judge the surface of sociocultural issues that frankly should be address this is a great movie it is not sexualization of kids it is not that judgmental either it presents a realistic contemporary story and moves you through the struggles of a young immigrant teen to find her place being negatively influenced by an adult world in the end she realizes on her own she needs to be free be herself and find her innocence again maïmouna doucouré should be proud of this movie those who feel uncomfortable should reflect and perhaps learn a little more about what is happening in some places of the world
Sep 13 2020,negative,aside from the explicit sexualization of children amy is a poorly written child character she even steals her uncles phone and pushes another girl into a river and watches her almost drown
Sep 13 2020,positive,the movie is not as easy to watch as its posters show it gives a strong sense of the difficulty of living in very different cultures especially for those young minds great music i love the ending overall i am not sure if the movie is made for kids maybe for their parents
Sep 13 2020,negative,worse than i could ever have imagined the world is worse for having this film in it
Sep 13 2020,negative,there could have been so many ways to tell about young girls falling to social pressure and social media tools this was not it from the title to the poster and the dancing is absolutely trash i have cancelled netflix simply because i dont want my kids to accidentally watch these kinds of shows especially when it is so accessible i will educate them my way without the digital screens
Sep 13 2020,positive,this movie is a comingofage story of a young immigrant girl trying to fit in with the cuties the popular girls who want to enter a dance contest it is not child porn or whatever else its being accused of the furor over the dancing itself is misplaced yes some of the dance moves are inappropriate for the girls ages and that is a plot point of the movie but thats a small part of what the movie is about its about a girl trying to fit in and the dynamics of her home life and her school life
Sep 13 2020,positive,didnt watch it very closely until the ending caught my eye then i rewound ami is a quick learner and can take care of herselfpencil in boys hand fight with girl pushing girl in the river lol interesting how at the end ami choses the middle ground and dresses somewhere in between her familys conservatism and her friends outlandishness this girl is much smarter than j lo
Sep 13 2020,negative,worst film ive seen this year
Sep 13 2020,positive,so i just finished watching the french film mignonnes aka cuties the latest fake controversy from the increasingly annoying socalled cancel culture i couldnt have a real opinion about the movie either way until id seen the film i hadnt seen any promotional material for it but i can tell you with great admiration that its solid directorial debut from frenchsenegales director maïmouna doucouré who also wrote the script       the film draws from her own personal experience growing up as a colored refugee herself the movie as a whole is a social commentary on the clashing of growing up in a traditional muslim household toxic internet culture and the hypersexualization of preadolescent girls with an ending that is poignant and beautiful that implies simply maybe its okay just to be a kid for right now       theres some wonderful performances to be had from fathia youssouf amy who is trapped between two worlds when does empowering dancing go too far say what you want about cardi b she isnt making her music videos like wap for 11 year old girls yet because of youtube and the internet in general these same girls are watching these videos and imitating them the movie wants to say shit its hard growing up and its hard to a parent and protect your child 24 hours a day from all the bad in this world even tho you want to try        its a film film of sorts not made for those who watch movies the same way they chew bubble gum most people dont want to be challenged in a film the average viewer want easy answer to complicated problems the world isnt this black and whitethe average viewer is a genre watcher some like horror some like action some like thrillers etc etc and youd be hard pressed to make a person who thinks the transformers series is high entertainment to find the subtle commentary of this film these types of people will only see whats on the surface or focus on one aspect of the feature they didnt like instead of digesting it as a whole        while writing this review i checked out the posters of the western release on netflix and i can see where the outrage can come from out of context the picture i attached here was the french and sundance promotional material which is drastically different than the netflix promotional material that says more about america i suppose that they thought that this hypersexualized poster would get more americans to watch the drama i guess thats a conversation that also needs to be had      my last thoughts again its a wonderful coming of age film with some tough subjects to digest its not a pedo movie as some viewers have suggested id even go further to guesstimate that many of the films detractors probably only saw the commercial and not that actual film which lets face it not having all the facts but forming loud opinions is a big symptom of the cancel culture  4 and a half stars out of 5 12
Sep 13 2020,positive,it was a great movie do not judge the book by it cover and must people who hate it never seen the movie i just realized if you mature person and you watch the move you will get the message behind the movie
Sep 13 2020,positive,this is a beautiful heartbreaking film about a young girl trapped between childhood and womanhood struggling between the two choices often given to women to be a reputable mother and wife modeled by her mother who is humiliated by her husband taking a second wife or to be a slut modeled by the images we see in the media and on the internet everyday this happens amidst the usual challenges of wanting to fit in and make friends after watching and enjoying this film i am left to believe that the ones who are offended by it cannot read subtitles and are judging it by a 30 second clip they saw in facebook 
Sep 13 2020,positive,this is a real world look into current girlhood it is crude and shows the struggles with sexual identity girls go through when they have elders exploiting sexual behavior it seems the experts rate this movie highly but the cancel culture currently happening wants to crucify the movie probably the same people who said jlo and shakira were great empowered women while openly making sexually explicit moves bunch of hypocrites the problem is not the movie its a great movie its society and adults being ok with sexual exploitation by adults calling it empowering and adopting explicit music and respective videos into mainstream the movie is raw and provocative but it shows the reality of our current society cancelling your netflix subscription as ive seen many post about is not going to fix the problem
Sep 13 2020,positive,excellent film that deals with the effects of social media on young girls hard to believe so many people are rating this based on a trailer and something they read  these people have given up on developing their own critical thinking skills and instead choose to uncritically follow the leader sad
Sep 13 2020,negative,terrible in every way imaginable
Sep 13 2020,negative,poorly conceived with a misguided agenda
Sep 13 2020,positive,a beautiful film heart breaking at times on so many levels voices loudly how we are failing our young people were battling through our own lives and disappointments which we assume that they are blind to we allow them to look to social media and the entertainment industry to get what theyre not getting from us then we are shocked when they emulate the undesirable behaviour that theyre being spoon fed maïmouna doucouré did an excellent job with this film the negative comments and reviews that it is getting are clearly from people who refuse to actually watch it
Sep 13 2020,negative,absolute cringe waste of an hour and a half
Sep 13 2020,negative,a movie that attempts to satirise a culture by focusing exclusively on its worst member cuties success is almost guaranteed thanks to the storm of negative publicity and vitriolic audience reaction thats welcomed its release i couldnt help but think that this topic and subject matter would have been more effective if presented as a documentary and not a as feature film we could have clips informative text and most importantly actual interviews with young girls who have been in situations like this the 1995 film showgirls was supposed to be a send up of the grim and sleazy exploitation of strippers in las vegas but ended up being something of an exploitation film in itself and i feel thats what cuties has done without really delving into its uncomfortable subject matter the film is content to merely leer at a group of 11year old girls dressed in revealing outfits and twerking incessantly the camerawork is far too graphic with constant closeups and lingering shot that feel disturbingly voyeuristic the message of underage sexualisation is frequently lost amongst precocious tween drama and most of the characters are so unlikable that you find it difficult to become invested in what theyre going through the main character amy doesnt so much develop as character as she does leap between 1 stupid action to the next sometimes the things she does are so ridiculous and unrealistic that they kill any kind of believability the movie was going for the film rolls along until the last 10 minutes when it decides quite abruptly that whats happening on screen isnt right like the screenwriter actually had a chance to read the entire script and see how degrading it was i fear this movie will live on only in infamy much like the aforementioned showgirls though hopefully without the same cult following
Sep 12 2020,positive,the movie is an absolute gut punch its incredibly beautiful and heartbreaking    and its saddening to see so many bad audience reviews from ignorant people who most likely have not seen the film at all but were so eager to take it down    cuties mignonnes is not just a film that criticizes the hypersexualisation of preadolescent girls but its also about how immigrant children face the pressure to distance themselves from their culture so as to blend in and how they fall prey to toxic internet culture
Sep 12 2020,positive,an accurate despiction on modern media in young generations
Sep 12 2020,positive,the idea is a risky yet intriguing one but it ultimately fails in bringing the directors intended message by unhealthily promoting exactly what it contains
Sep 12 2020,positive,cuties was a difficult movie to watch because it accurately shows what it is like to be a young girl growing up is confusing and scary especially if there is no one to talk to about what you are experiencing and seeing girls are told to be modest and are also told that being sexy is the only way to get what you want for girls today this is even more confusing with social media i recommend this movie and yes it will feel uncomfortable but so is growing up
Sep 12 2020,negative,unnecessary  badly achieved the supposed message implies the opposite  if you can avoid it
Sep 12 2020,positive,beautiful film cuties is seen thru the lens of the girl protagonist amy its her perspective from her experience showing the pressures and curiosity of what its like for a 12 year old about to become a teen it shows her trying to understand sexuality the change of her and her peers bodies how many girls dress and act and how she competes for acceptance from her peers who are moving at a faster speed growing up than herself    if you want to talk about films that hypersexualize girls but has high reviews from viewers then watch american beauty with kevin spacey american beauty is a perfect example of a film that does hypersexualizes young girls in a really creepy glorification sorta way seen thru the lens of the male gaze that film tries to normalize an old man screwing a virgin teenager who is friends with his daughter    its funny when the perspective is thru the female gaze or from the females perspective  people call it trash and corrupt but when the perspective is thru the lens of the male gaze as in the case of american beauty its art    the reaction to this film shows just how deeply sexist of a world we live in we need to see stories like cuties which reveal what the world looks like to a young girl coming into an age of sexuality and maturity
Sep 12 2020,positive,this movie is for an audience of emotionally mature adults that dont just see a poster and have a knee jerk puritanical uninformed reaction  maïmouna doucourés movie is about the hyper sexualized world that young girls have to navigate on their own without the help of adults that would prefer   see the movie before you add to the hate on twitter destroy a woman directors career or cancel your netflix subscription  netflix was at fault for its advertising of cuties but i appreciate their apology to the director and those offended by it and applaud them keeping cutiesmignonnes available for people to view
Sep 12 2020,negative,sexualization if children this movie should never have been made 
Sep 12 2020,negative,poorly edited  gratuitous scenes
Sep 12 2020,positive,everyone rating this low cause they are confusing message with messenger
Sep 12 2020,positive,i heard of mignonnes due to the virulent campaign against it brought about by its poster i decided to give it try and i didnt regret it the film depicts the conflict between traditionalism and modernity as well as the hypersexualisation of girls due to social media pressures i found the characters engaging and the story both provocative and moving
Sep 12 2020,positive,very good movie its supposed to make you uncomfortable for crying out loud its the kind of movie thats supposed to make you think its not about female empowerment its a comingofage movie not all movies are done to purely entertain see it its an important movie that does not encourage sexualization of children if you feel that way watching the movie seriously seek help somethings wrong with you please make sure you watch it till the end it makes more sense when you see how the story evolves great director
Sep 12 2020,positive,great exercise on technology immigration growing up and fitting in this is a dire warning to parents about the dangers of social media in the era of tiktok which largely go unchecked  people are enraged about this movie when they should actually be paying attention to how they allow their kids to participate in social media the films sexualized treatment of a group of kids dancing is supposed to shock and ellicit a response i found myself disgusted and uncomfortable because it was sadand hard to watch but a reality  great cinematic essay
Sep 12 2020,positive,this movie is unsettling to watch thats the point initially after hearing all the bad press on this film i too planned to not watch as some warped idea of protest however ignorance rarely is a positive so i decided to give it a look im so glad i did the movie focuses on four 11 year old girls obsessed about performing their hypersexualized dance routine for a dance competition the shock of this movie is that it doesnt shy away from ugliness of the realities that young girls and for that matter grown woman face to some this movie may see hyperbolic yet with the constant hypersexualize of women of tv and worse yet instagram its impossible for young girls not to see and internalize these messages and ultimately believe that sexiness is the epitome of womanhood  that sexiness is the only value a woman can have as a 34 year old woman the ending of this movie conjured up some tears as i saw myself in these girls and i grew up in the presocial media era  before casting a vote watch the movie and then decide maybe youll see that the message of this film is one we can all get behind
Sep 12 2020,positive,im not reviewing as a predator im reviewing as a mom of a teenage girl id honestly give it higher than 35 stars if people could watch with an open mind im also not endorsing it because it is hard to watch and its supposed to be when they do their dance at the end the scene thats floating across the internet the audience bood and covered their childrens eyes the point was that they had gone way too far but they didnt even understand what they were doing  the film was sweet and innocent and sick and painful all in one its a coming of age story of a very naive young muslim girl amy who wants desperately to fit in and doesnt really understand what shes doing none of the girls do its definitely got an independent film feel to it because its rather slow and a lot of people wont like it for that nonetheless the controversial topic however its meant to bring attention to how the sexualization of women impacts young girls the director did a great job of reminding us that these were young kids who didnt really even understand what they were doing i remember being that age and feeling much the same way its the time when they were just beginning to be introduced to sexualtiy there were several scenes to remind us that they were young and naive and didnt have a full grasp on sex education nonetheless sexuality they were copying what they saw in videos  i do agree that the angles and close ups were too much but the overall theme and purpose for the movie was good it was actually designed to bring attention to the need to protect young girls but to do that they had to sexualize the young actresses i admire the effort i dont necessarily endorse it
Sep 12 2020,negative,it had all the tools to do what the writer wanted and say what it needed to say but instead they focused on close ups of sensual dances performed by underage girls and didnt shine the light on want it need and should have been about
Sep 12 2020,positive,mignonnes holds a mirror up to society in a way that is absolutely necessary any woman in her 20s30s need to watch it the promo material on the american side was messed up and this film shouldve been promoted with integrity for anyone viewing please try and watch the french version with subtitles instead of an english overdub parents please watch as well but use discretion in regards to children watching might be better if they are late teens and can be followed up with comprehensive dialogue about social media society pressure and femininity culture i cried for my 11 year old self and recommend for anyone who have grown up a womxnfemme in todays world
Sep 12 2020,positive,45  dont buy the hype  there are uncomfortable scenes and they worked well in delivering discomfort to the audience  no way does this film promote child hypersexuality
Sep 12 2020,negative,dont normalize child sexualization  this movie should remove all such scenes story was average nothing to rave
Sep 12 2020,positive,just watched it on netflix loved it looking forward to more by maïmouna doucouré
Sep 12 2020,positive,great film deserves many awards
Sep 12 2020,positive,lets talk about the elephant in the room first anyone who actually watched this and thinks the movie oversexualizes the girls in it probably should be on a watch list im guessing the bigger issue here is that the movie is about a girl from a conservative islamic family trying to make her way through life in paris there are no hur hurs in this movie it can be very tough to watch as this girl goes through a lot of difficult things this movie reminds me of good boys and mean girls without the laughs with a large dose of moonlight its a very serious movie and a well made movie despite the rating i will recommend that my wife and our 11 year old daughter watch it together its certainly not for every 11 year old but mine can handle the subject matter i like the movie good enough but i wont watch it again its simply not the type of movie you watch to feel good about anything well made artsy but ultimately not how i would have chosen to entertain myself if not for the ridiculous and unfounded negative attention
Sep 12 2020,negative,hard to imagine the need to say that sexualizing children is wrong but it is 2020 after all
Sep 12 2020,negative,disgusting use of real child over exposure and sexualisation
Sep 12 2020,negative,this movie is garbage the director claims its to draw attention to the over sexualization of children but really it seems more like she just wanted shock value an hour and ten min of essentially just showing 11 year olds backsides mixed in with a 14 year old girls bare chest can not be redeemed by some tears and a smile in the last 10 min
Sep 12 2020,negative,ive seen this movie because of its controversy wanted to see if its really as shocking as everyone says and to my surprise  it is not as shocking it is however extremely boring the story itself is really badly written starts with no nuance and heavy preaching and ends up going nowhere and meaning nothing if there was no controversy this film would simply fade into obscurity with its blandness now yes there are scenes where little girls are dancing in an implying manner and other topics like that related to coming out of age i found them displeasing but not as shocking as the controversy suggests to be honest i dont think this movie deserves that much attention    now if you want to watch this movie firstly consider this 1 is there a book that you wanted to read but you didnt have time 2 maybe there is a game waiting for you to play in your steam library that you never got around to play 3 how about calling a friend or a family member that you havent spoken to for a while these are all much better things to do rather than watching this bland movie
Sep 12 2020,positive,i removed a star because of the awkward and uncomfortable scenes that i think what the director is trying to relay to their audience 
Sep 12 2020,positive,this film reflects what girls are thinking and doing in these times of social networks and videos always wanting to grow up and be seen as women the message is very good    women with young daughters should see her with them and reflect on the message
Sep 12 2020,negative,no matter the message of a story there should not be minors sexualized on screen stage etc having actual minors mimic sexual moves while the costumes are tight fitting the cameras focus on their bodies while they move and overall doing insanely inappropriate things minors shouldnt be shown doing on the screen
Sep 12 2020,positive,loved it  pulls at heartstrings  looking forward to more films by maïmouna doucouré
Sep 12 2020,positive,i just watched it and its actually an incredibly sad story its about a muslim girl who is trying to assimilate to a new culture her father is marrying a second wife which is part of the culture but the young girl witnesses her mother breaking down about it and it kind of makes question things even more she begins rejecting the culture completely she clings on to a group of girls who are trying to be hip hop dancers mimicking what they see other adult professionals do she is being pushed so far in one direction by her family that she goes to the extreme and wants to be the opposite of what her family expects at the end though she freezes up at the dance competition because reality seems to hit her all at once she is supposed to attend the wedding for her father and his second wife she runs back home and her aunt begins to immediately yell at her her aunt has pushed her mom to accept the new wife and talked about marrying the girl off when the girl got her period the mom hops in and finally defends the daughter telling the daughter that she doesnt have to attend the wedding if she doesnt want and she will support her either way at the end of the movie the girl is dressed in normal street wear with her hair styled the way she likes she walks past the celebration for her fathers second marriage she begins jump roping in the street with some other kids she has finally found herself and having her mothers support was a big part in her figuring out who she truly wanted to be    the movie is real like it keeps it real the point of it is to show the reality of what middle school aged girls face but also a personal story about how tough it is to be caught in between two very different cultures its sad its cringeworthy its powerful its reality     whats really ironic is that if everyone stopped sexualizing children maybe they would understand what the movie is actually about
Sep 12 2020,positive,honestly doesnt receive all of the negative feedback its getting as a country we can be very dramatic i would honestly give this 4 in a half solid movie i love that they dont spell things out but you have to ride the roller coaster of an 11 year olds mindset on things
Sep 12 2020,positive,mignonnes is best described as being a very challenging film its ambitious presentation eclipses its more humble core and while its clear that the film has risen to a place of notoriety and notoriousness through its extremely modern interpretation and edgy subject matter the films core does have strong merit     firstly lets get the controversy out of the way yes this film is very controversial any film discussing childhood in the modern era of social media will be walking on eggshells mignonnes does less stepping on eggshells more than smashing entire cartons full of eggs with great panache an 11year old galpal squad of twerk dancers is a lot and the cinematography is highly aware of the disconnect that this draws in the mind of the audience it frequently depicts these girls in dances and poses that sexualizes them and the clear intention is to make the viewer deeply uncomfortable and while on a surface level this may make moods simmer and bring up controversial opinions from all angles it needs to be remembered that discomfort is part of the intention behind the film     that is because the film really wants to place a divide between two things on multiples levels a divide between what it means to be an adult and what it means to be a child a divide between religious tradition and 21stcentury hedonism a divide between african culture and european culture and the film illustrates this directly through its presentation it takes extreme care to highlight the grotesque nature of the girls hobby while also highlighting the protagonists obvious chafing with the culture that made her that she quickly stops identifying with and its that reality that makes the film intriguing     but an intriguing film and a good film are two different things so the question must be asked is mignonnes a good film and this is yet another difficult film to answer    narratively the film is strong this character drama that has the young protagonist slowly descend into a form of madness is extremely compelling she begins shy and naive and very quickly that is eroded by the new culture she is exposed to you might think wow shes really changed but shell get a handle of it eventually no no she does not  she rides that crazy train til the last station what starts as looking at videos of mature dancing turns into emulating that mature dancing what starts as flirting with social media turns to oversharing what starts as rejection of tradition turns into a complete rejection of morality the thought of nude photos in this subject matter might make you squirm but you shouldnt be surprised when things quickly flirt instead with violence and nearattempted murder all for selfish misguided ambitions of the protagonist its a wild ride one that has an extremely fulfilling conclusion that brings the entire plot fullcircle and it deserves strong praise    the actual cinematography however is a bit wonky some scenes are expertly choreographed and framed with strong intention many of the dance scenes show a discomforting innocence that feels appropriate while all of the scenes within the protagonists house are gripping showing the mazelike configuration of the small impoverished apartment giving the whole set itself a strained cramped mood other times the cinematography is as disorganized as the girls ambitions the camera wobbles without cohesion and it looks like the goal was just to film the scene quickly rather than intentionally it just seems confused at times and out of place in a film that has lots of potential     the other issue is that as the show juggles so many heavy social commentaries sometimes it drops a ball here and there the overall performance of this juggling act is maintained but it does seem to meander between topics is this a film about kids doing something they shouldnt yes but it also revels in the rebellion is this film about traditional senegalese culture yes but it constantly flaunts the culture as well as the western culture thats used to mirror it is the film religious yes but it also outright rejects the religious undertones it presents very loudly is the film about family yes but it can be hard to tell when the film is also about the rebellion away from that family unit the issues it tackles are very intriguing but because there are so many things to commentate on it can feel that the film is pingponging between topics scenes end a bit abruptly at times and if youre looking for really strong resolution from the creators be prepared for shades of grey instead     so what of that core is the film good its definitely a film that wishes to test your limits on what makes a good story and how it can be shown through film if anything is to be said the film rises above its social controversy to say something meaningful this makes the film imminently interpretable from a million different perspectives which seems to be the intention behind its creation but it can also make the various parts and smaller moments a bit slipshod and confusing how deep the film is able to actually bore toward its core message is the true debate
Sep 12 2020,positive,actually watched the movie and it was a great view of adolescence and coming of age from a unique voice the layers of puberty the immigrant experience and modern girlhood was intense the dress and dancing were on par with any other cheerdance show that airs in the us this film is definitely the victim of a smear campaign from people who saw an awful poster and not the film or even the trailer
Sep 12 2020,negative,i do honestly believe the director meant the best young girls are faced with so much pressure these days however i believe the point could have been delivered more delicately should i say  misguided plot
Sep 12 2020,negative,somebody made this somebody pitched the idea hired a bunch of crew members edited the footage together and submitted it to a major film distributor and somehow in the time that the production of this film likely took nobody stopped to think that maybe this isnt a good idea and cancel or rework the project which is saddening
Sep 11 2020,positive,i watched the movie to see why people hate it so much audience score is extremely low all i have seen was a decent comingofage film i didnt see anything wrong with the movie except a couple of plotholes i recommend it to all the people who loves comingofage genre like i do it is nothing special but worth checking out     ps  i bet most of the people that gave it one star havent actually see the movie
Sep 11 2020,negative,i could barely figure out what the directors intention was with this film almost all of it made me really uncomfortable i know there is a huge controversy based on how the film was marketed in the us but people were saying to give the movie a chance so i did i just didnt think the movie was well made the english dubs were really awful and the message of the film was very weak are twerking 11yearold dance groups actually a big thing in france why did the director feel a need to make this it was kind of suggested that sexualizing girls is wrong and kind of suggested that these girls come from bad home lives but also the people who were against the twerking 11yearolds were made to seem like lame boomers all around i guess i believe that the director was trying to make a greater point about how sexualizing kids is wrong but she really did a poor job and it was not a good movie also the way the dance scenes were filmed seemed really creepy there is kind of no defending zooming in on the girls crotches and butts it was sickening
Sep 11 2020,negative,i tried to keep in mind this movie is more about young girls awkward teenage years dealing with becoming a young woman but couldnt take it serious with how the teenagers were sexualized during the movie this may be how some teenage girls navigate those awkward years but making a movie glorifying sexualizing teenage girls is wrong on so many levels this should be a lesson to parents on how not to raise your daughters
Sep 11 2020,positive,i think the controversy around the movie is more about netflix marketing campaign than the movie itself it is a coming of age film that tries to make a statement around the social influences on prepubescent girls and how they react to it it is a little like how natural born killers used extreme violence to make a statement about how society glorifies sexuality the reaction of the secondary characters bin the film to the girls sexual dance and antics make clear that the film maker and most of society rejects the sexualization of these girls     the movie  story itself was somewhat engaging but uneven and erratic this may have been an artistic choice to match the movie with the main characters mood swings but it seemed rushed at times  she goes quickly from innocent 11 year old to a mentally unbalanced and violent exhibitionist in a way that is hard to accept this may have been done for time but left me shaking my head failing to empathize with a character who would invite it if properly developed
Sep 11 2020,negative,wrong just so wrong
Sep 11 2020,negative,cuties review the movie itself was meant tokind ofcrap on sexualizing childrenby sexualizing children they messed up this message in a lot of ways and it is completely gross theres not enough sulfuric acid in the world to erase what i saw    grade f
Sep 11 2020,negative,come on netflixyoure better than thisor maybe youre not
Sep 11 2020,negative,this is a film that exploits children even if the intent was to condemn the exploitation of children you cannot do that by exploiting children overall i was extremely uncomfortable watching this
Sep 11 2020,negative,atrocious and offensive 
Sep 11 2020,negative,what were they thinking
Sep 11 2020,negative,this movie is absolute trash  dont sully your brain with this junk
Sep 11 2020,positive,it is a very thoughtful movie about girls navigating living in patriarchal systems alongside how women are presented and portrayed in entertainment industries  really well done
Sep 11 2020,positive,great and fun movie but unfortunately with an ending that disappoints    the story of a girl turning into a woman and how she tries to deal with all of the unexpected changes while living in a rupture family is enough to get you engaged    anyway i dont get the controversy around this the movie portrayed all that a normal teenager would do i remember doing similar stuff too so i laughed my heart out when the girls were just pranking and messing around i would prefer though that the movie had a betterproper ending
Sep 11 2020,positive,a lot of people reviewing this movie negatively have either not seen the movie and are therefore reviewing it from a decontextualised perspective or have missed the point of the movie in one way or another i also wouldnt be surprised if men find this more uncomfortable because they have not experienced growing up as a woman has i also thing that if you have grown up in a social media age youll probably understand and relate to parts of this film much more additionally its important to keep in mind that if these characters were played by adults the message would be lost because we are so used to seeing women act in such manner    the film focuses on growing up between two cultures a religious one and a more western one as a preteen entering teenagehood and the way in which social media today impact the way this all happens the girls in this movie despite being very young dont want to be seen as young they want to be seen as grown up so go around this by imitating female celebrities and unknowingly sexualising themselves while posting their dances on social media hinting at the potential dangers such unrestricted access has to young children     i will admit that there are a few scenes that were shot in a very distasteful way and perhaps not as contextualised well within the actual film and of course the out of contexts clips may be shocking for some but the reality is that this happens more often than you think be it on social media i think tiktok is probably the best example for us today or in real life even the director explained in her interview with netflix which can be found on youtube that she came up with the idea for this film when she saw a group of younger dancers dancing in a very adult way on stage
Sep 11 2020,positive,people need to see this movie to get a grasp on what the children are up against out there  they did a great job of conveying that this behavior and over sexualization of children is happening right under our noses and no one is paying attention
Sep 11 2020,negative,contrary to whatever narrative some of this films supporters may be purporting i did try to see this film with a clean slate    in a purely objective sense the director has obvious talent in terms of tone she has nailed the grounded nuance that can come with the emotional roller coaster of adolescence in terms of style she has a clear vision and the skill with which to achieve it the actresses especially the lead were also phenomenal showing the varying degrees of confusion anger discomfort and joy of girls trying to find their place in the world furthermore i could sense an intention to decry pop cultures sexualization of young girls bodies while also arguing that restricting girls to ultramodest roles isnt a proper alternative as well the movie ultimately has a pleasantly creative message that girls shouldnt be pushed to one of two extremes but land where they feel comfortable usually somewhere in the middle this ending is reached somewhat quickly but it communicated all the same    however whatever intentions are squandered by a vision that while clear is also inexperienced and that is giving every benefit of the doubt to the crews intentions perhaps in an attempt to be as real and raw as possible the director overshot her goal    this movie crosses the line from gritty into gratuitous and keeps on going the dance sequences are especially disturbing  going on for so long and with so much focus on these girls bodies they stop making the audience uncomfortably confront any social evil and quickly devolve into shock for shocks sake and possibly a source of gratification for said social evils and thats just the dances to say nothing of the scenes involving contraception genitalia pictures or an exorcism yes an exorcism    such scenes could be defended as illustrating just how evil and destructive this aspect of our culture is if more time was dedicated to how girls are enticed into this behavior with social acceptance but for every anonymous like on social media lingering gaze of a security guard or wicked smile of a viewer there is also a shocked boy chastising them a clearly uncomfortable security guard and a disgusted parent covering their childs eyes the inclusion of amys the lead character father and his second wife couldve served as motivation for why she so drastically rebels against her home life but so little time and development is given to this arc she hardly ever directly confronts her mother who is also distraught over feeling discarded by her husband that it has minimal effect these attempts for balance and nuance only muddy the attempt at social commentary and do not justify the obscene imagery that accompany them    all in all i found this movie misguided and overthetop however noble the intentions mayve been assuming thats not a front to disguise more sinister aims the graphic nature of the dances lose their intended effect of starting conversations and the scenes exploring the effects they have on the girls are underdeveloped if this were a documentary or a film with younglooking adult actresses or even an animated film i mightve defended it more but given these are actual children performing in this movie it has sadly become a sample of the very evil it tried to condemn
Sep 11 2020,negative,if this is progress in movie format story telling i think i am done with todays movies 
Sep 11 2020,negative,its meaning was lost when it made tight shots on amys exorcism and other body parts of other characters  could have just shown amy wanting to dance and the trials she watched her mother go through and had a great film take out all of the body part shots and just have a normal non sexual dance routine and it would be great coming of age movie and have a great lesson  ariel in footloose wanted to dance and it wasnt sexualized like this although parents in the 80s thought it was disgusting lol
Sep 11 2020,positive,heartwarming drama and generally wholesome film about the real world difficulties of growing up
Sep 11 2020,negative,horrific and unbelievable that netflix would make this and pretend like its good
Sep 11 2020,negative,you cant have a commentary on the sexualization of children if you are sexualizing children doesnt matter what the movie is about at that point
Sep 11 2020,positive,this movie is receiving more hate than it deserves its a modern coming of age film its about an 11yr old from a different nationality moving to france going to a new school getting her first period and making friends with the rebel girls and doing a dance competition yes there is twerking or at least attempts at twerking honestly they look like a bunch of clumsy middle school girls attempting to be sexy and failing miserably they are middle school aged girls doing middle school aged things and before you even think about well i dont like the way they are dressed or how they danced then you probably dont like cheerleading outfits dance outfits and im sure pageants are the devil to you  this isnt a bad film worth watching at least once if you dont mind subtitles
Sep 11 2020,negative,this wrong and shouldnt be show
Sep 11 2020,negative,absolutely disgusting why did they choose to film this age group of all age groups it makes no sense it would have maybe been more modest if they choose 16 or 17 year olds who face what this film is supposedly trying bring awareness to but 11 year olds goes too far i wanted to throw up every minute of the movie if it was made for the purpose that they are trying to write it off as now then why did it not clearly make that a theme or why is it rated for a mature adult audience if it supposedly is for children to inform them it makes no sense where this movie was going and ended up just being tasteless and disgusting
Sep 11 2020,negative,wtfterrible
Sep 11 2020,positive,it would be hard to feel uncomfortable by the sexualization of children in this movie but umthats the point i understand that this subject area is very sensitive to people but im not sure how many of the audience reviewers actually sat down and watched the whole movie it would be very hard to see this movie as a glorification of the sexualization of children i would definitely not recommend this movie for children but it might be important for parents to understand the challenges that young girls face with social media people should be more concerned with the sexualization of girls think charlie damelio that being said the movie itself is very well done but a bit too artsy for me
Sep 11 2020,neutral,so i did think the movie wasnt as bad as i expected but you cant get away with the sexualization children if your intent is to celebrate liberty freedom and coming of age of 11 year old children     it couldve been so much better and meaningful if they decided to portray a black mirror style movie where you critisize sexualized pop culture for influencing minors with their crap and clearly demonstrate the negative consequences social media has on youth and codemn it    unfortunately this movie was a celebration of way too young children being free to express themselves as they please
Sep 11 2020,negative,its a boring train wreck of a movie with little substance  it is rightfully blasted for sexualizing and exploiting children boring and gross but mostly boring
Sep 11 2020,positive,everyone tripping out over this movie hasnt seen it yes netflix usa screwed up big with that poster the movie is just a coming age story about a girl growing up and figuring out who she is the dancing scenes equate to maybe 6 or 7 minutes of actual movie time and if youre weirded out by the outfits yes that is the point of the movie that she is trying to hard to rebel against her countrys traditions that she goes too far watch the movie before you freak out    all of the actors did a great job and the movie is very well shot and directed
Sep 11 2020,positive,i found it very powerful a good visual narrative of the over sexualization of young girls  an 11 year old girl from senegal finds herself in a new country new school shes trying to find her way and fit in while her home life becomes an emotional struggle
Sep 11 2020,negative,i know its hip and suspicious to halfstar this movie but i just couldnt figure out a reason for it to exist it loves what it claims to mock
Sep 11 2020,negative,it fails to deliver the message its trying to go for by doing the exact same thing the message is trying to say not to do sexualizing young girls
Sep 11 2020,negative,even as a body positivity and gen z myself i think that this is way too sexualized as the characters are little children
Sep 11 2020,positive,this movie made me cry was so beautiful   i feel like my childhood self was happy to see this   how freeing it is to see the main character amy eventually put her foot down for what she wants after seeing and feeling the pain that her mother goes though due to following orders  1010 recommend this one touched on my heart
Sep 11 2020,positive,stellar example of art house film watched this due to negative to put it mildly chat on twitter regarding this film i saw the child porn stuff as only a metaphor of western values as balance to the the ultraconservative muslim family life the kid main character came from this movie made me miss the grand cinema in downtown tacoma wa where it would have probably been on their tuesday special screening damn i miss that place during this upside down 2020
Sep 11 2020,positive,it was a really insightful comingofage story with maïmouna doucourés directing onpoint i dont get why people are disliking it without even seeing it and i think that they are very wrong about it yes its different so what
Sep 10 2020,negative,i felt more comfortable watching a saw sequel than this id honestly rather watch someone get their skin peeled off than have to watch this i heard all the drama about it and didnt think it could be this disgusting but wow was i wrong
Sep 10 2020,negative,wtf how is this a thing there is no excuse
Sep 10 2020,negative,so youre providing a commentary on the sexual exploitation of children by sexually exploitating children got it 
Sep 10 2020,neutral,the movie did effectively critique the sexualization of children but it is also a great example of filmmakers exploiting young girls on camera they could have gotten the point across without having little kids simulate sex acts in front of adults really horrific that this movie was written and produced and distributed as is
Sep 10 2020,negative,sexualizing children in this way is very inappropriate and dangerous definitely something id never want my daughter to see if this is considered empowering for little girls or women in generalwell we are doomed
Sep 10 2020,negative,hmmmmm one word  noooooo   this movie should have been cancelled but whatever its to late  netflix could listen to the peopleaudience and not just ignore it
Sep 10 2020,negative,no one wanted this next time please use adults to show that we shouldnt sexualize children
Sep 10 2020,positive,the film is not bad there are many children of scarce resources including me who have or had such a childhood what i really think is that the ending is a little hasty it ends and never explains anything else as if the everything will be forgotten in a few hours i defend the film its raw and it can be taken as a religion movie i never expect them to watch movies like chicuarotes violent raw and full of reality but i do ask that be a little openminded at least let others enjoy
Sep 10 2020,negative,i hope all the corporations learn from this mistake
Sep 10 2020,negative,gross it really is as bad as the hype if the film maker was going for ironic commentary on sexualization it backfired badly i feel awful for the little girls in it
Sep 10 2020,negative,this movie repeatedly sexualizes children not only as characters but to other adult characters in the movie for example in one scene the main characters sneak into a building when caught by the guards they proceed to dance while the camera focuses on their lower bodies while the adult security guards watch this is not very good
Sep 10 2020,negative,think of it like this i made a movie that says seal bashing is bad and to highlight my point i went out and not only killed baby seals but sold their furs on the black market as well thats what this movie is only with child exploitation its not the movie its not the message its just the execution beyond that nothing could prepare me for just how graphic it actually was i was so sick i unironically gagged
Sep 10 2020,negative,awful just awful not sure how this movie can seriously exist
Sep 10 2020,negative,while the subject matter is an important one to have it is possible to do so without literally sexualizing children it was disgusting to watch  made me nauseous
Sep 10 2020,negative,for those calling this a comingofage movie you either have no children of your own andor failed to realize that this movie was rated ma mature audiences and was not meant for children according to the ratings board  meaning what we have here is a movie hypersexualizing children for adults  creepy and irresponsible
Sep 10 2020,negative,this is just plain bad dont watch it
Sep 10 2020,negative,this type of movie is a plague to society and needs to be removed immediately
Sep 10 2020,negative,this is a movie that shouldnt have been made
Sep 10 2020,negative,sexual exploitation and objectification of preteenage girls is not appropriate entertainment no matter how well done the end product might be
Sep 10 2020,negative,i wish i could rate it lower
Sep 10 2020,negative,it really is appalling to see children being sexualized
Sep 10 2020,negative,this movie is so ironic the message of young girls shouldnt be sexualized is completely ruined when the director decides to sexualize young girls and have them dance provocatively this was so hard to watch i also do not understand who the movie was made for the movie is rated ma for mature audiences and no decent adult should feel good after watching this
Sep 10 2020,negative,if this is deemed ok for a movie in 2020 im fearful for what isnt deemed appropriate canceling netflix subscription for sure
Sep 10 2020,negative,it was boring and offensive
Sep 10 2020,negative,to put it lightly what the actual fuck
Sep 10 2020,negative,worse than i could have ever imagined
Sep 10 2020,negative,this has got to be one of the most repugnant and disgraceful films ever made i am sickened to know that there are adults in the world that would display and parade children around in such an explicit and sexual manner this movie is immoral and needs to be removed from netflix
Sep 10 2020,negative,not appropriate for any audience
Sep 10 2020,negative,would not recommend to a soul no no no
Sep 10 2020,positive,the controversy around this movie is stupid its a solid coming of age movie
Sep 10 2020,negative,this should be removed from netflix
Sep 10 2020,negative,can i give less than half a star 
Sep 10 2020,negative,whatand i cant stress this enoughthe actual fuck
Sep 10 2020,negative,0 stars are you kidding me this movie is real sick
Sep 10 2020,negative,garbagedo not watch
Sep 10 2020,negative,this movie is being attacked as inappropriate but the main issue i had with the movie is the rating didnt match the content and the dubbing was not done properly this should have stayed as a independent film you will only see at film festivals and not on a main network
Sep 10 2020,positive,for some strange reason american marketing companies cant translate foreign films well often the trailers misrepresent the subtlety of the story and netflixs promotion of cuties known as mignonnes in france is a prime example granted i completely understand why the trailer and the initial poster turned a lot of audiences away from even giving the film a chance but i was hoping a film like this was just misrepresented again hopefully    a 12 year old girl by the name of amy just moved from senegal to france as her mother mentally prepares for her husbands marriage to another woman while she travels to school she comes across a group of young women who proclaim themselves as cuties a young teenage group who rebel and dress pass their age amy finds a fascination with the group in comparison to her cultural values but also finds herself rebelling and taking things way too far    the biggest complaint about mignonnes marketing was how the young teens dressed and danced in a hypersexual mannerbut the catch is the movie knows it the film doesnt hesitate to quickly criticize amy and her friends representation of growing up too soon there is a brilliantly directed scene early on when amy hearts some heartbreaking news that catalyzes what makes her rebel find influence in older women away from her culture the dynamic amy has with her friends still allows for them to feel youthful and naturally curious about what it means to be grown up    while i praise the film for being selfaware in its critiques i will acknowledge the film understandably gets very uncomfortable in places around the second half and the final dance the dancing becomes more sexualized as time goes on and while many characters acknowledge thats not okay theres still about 15 of them that take those second glances i also wished the film gave a little more time to balance out the traditional lifestyle amy is constantly trying to run away from    mignonnes is a fascinatingly uncomfortable reflection on womanhood and traditional values the conflict of what it means to be a woman between the dancing and religion is an interesting angle but sometimes plays the male gaze a little too close to the hip its a shame since there are some really great moments in this film that will never be seen by many because of that trailer and poster
Sep 10 2020,negative,its disgusting i have an eightyearold daughter and i couldnt shake off the feeling that this is what is being normalized
Sep 10 2020,negative,if i could give this movie 05 stars trust me i would
Sep 10 2020,negative,disgusting cancel netflix
Sep 10 2020,negative,vile exploitative filth
Sep 10 2020,negative,horrible in every possible way

Sep 10 2020,negative,this movie needs to be taken off of netflix its pretty bad
Sep 10 2020,negative,complete dreck netflix needs to clean house this is not a minor oversight or a simple mistake it took colossal failures at multiple levels to get this movie onto their service they had multiple opportunities to pull it down or abort     they arent the only game in town for streaming content i voted with my dollars have canceled my subscription i expect others will as well
Sep 10 2020,positive,despite all of the troll reviews here my honest opinion that is this movie only makes people uncomfortable because of the exposure  this is a perfect portrayal of what it means to grow up as girl  the little girl clearly was stuck betweening rejecting how her mother exists because their idea of a real woman made her sad and hyper sexuality  she was trying to find another way to exist outside of the oppressive state of her mother as girls we arent told how to exist  then towards the end after intellectualizing this hyper sexual existence she went back to being a regular girl growing up thats why they left both the dance clothes and the wedding clothes on the bed to show she was rejecting both the cinematic clues are to obvious i hate everyone for thinking that hiding how we exist is going to save lives
Sep 10 2020,negative,absolute garbage movie  i cant believe this is being normalized for the general public
Sep 10 2020,negative,this is an embarrassment
Sep 10 2020,negative,absolutely appalling
Sep 9 2020,positive,i received a lot of hate because of its terrible and misleading marketing but it doesnt deserve it for the most part its a thoughtful honest timely rewarding and poignant coming of age drama that offers commentary on religion feminism and child sexualization those themes and subject matters make it hard to watch and sometimes disturbing but it treats them with honesty and nuance although the film as a whole is not for everyones taste
Sep 9 2020,positive,nevermind the netflix marketing blunder that probably resulted in a few people being fired this movie is not about that poster and it deserves respect touching tastefully filmed with elements of faith and great performances with an outstanding one by the lead character 
Sep 9 2020,positive,honestly i watched it to see if it was as bad as everyone said it it really wasnt its not anything like people made it out to be its basically about a tween muslim girl trying out new things that doesnt go with her familys traditional values and while the dancing scenes are cringe as hell it does display a more defining message on how we do as a society sexualize kids i think people saw the poster and just got mad honestly really good movie worth a chance to try before u say anything
